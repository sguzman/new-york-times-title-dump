1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"Through a series of errors and misunderstandings, the body of an 18-year-old Brooklyn youth, who was rushed by ambulance from his parents' apartment to a hospital late on the night of Dec. 8, lay unidentified in a city morgue for a week until it was finally claimed yesterday. The parents, Theodore and Parthenia Washington, said they dialed the 911 emergency telephone line for an ambulance at 11:45 P.M. on Dec. 8, when their son, Eric, had a severe asthma attack. An Emergency Medical Service crew arrived five minutes later and took the youth to a hospital. He died, apparently of natural causes, less than an hour after arriving at the hospital, city officials said. But his parents said they had been unable to find out where he had been taken -and what had happened to him - for eight days until they asked City Council President Andrew J. Stein for help on Tuesday."

Yet, even though her Cavalier does little more than partner her in a pas de deux, he can still create a pleasant impression with his stage presence, as two talented young dancers demonstrated when they made their debuts in this part at recent performances of the New York City Ballet."
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"The economy grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, the Government announced today, but inflation picked up as well. The Commerce Department's report on the rise in the gross national product represented only a slight revision from the Government's estimate a month ago of a 2.9 percent growth rate in the quarter, but was sharply higher than the six-tenths of 1 percent rate in the spring. Inflation, however, almost nonexistent in the spring, revived as well in the July-September period. A price measure tied to the G.N.P., which is the broadest indicator of the nation's economic health, rose at an annual rate of 3.8 percent during the summer, double the spring pace."

1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"Most of Spain's high schools were shut today as striking students marched in cities around the country to protest college admission policies. Apparently inspired by students in France, hundreds of thousands of Spaniards joined in the strike, and tens of thousands marched in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville and most of the remaining provincial capitals. Protesting French students in recent weeks have forced the conservative Government of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac to abandon plans to tighten university admission. The issues are similar here, where it is the center-left Government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, that has been seeking to rationalize admission to the country's overrun and underfinanced universities."

1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"John Z. DeLorean was found not guilty today of defrauding his failed sports car company of $8.5 million. But prosecutors immediately challenged the not-guilty verdicts on the 15 counts, including fraud and racketeering, saying the jurors may have misinterpreted the legal instructions given by Federal District Judge Julian A. Cook Jr. The jury decided to acquit Mr. DeLorean, 61 years old, despite the fact that 3 of the 12 jurors thought he was guilty, several jurors said in interviews tonight. They said they thought they had to acquit Mr. DeLorean if they could not unanimously agree on a verdict. They apparently ignored the possibility of declaring a hung jury, according to the interviews."

1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"Rule No. 1 is simple: If you want this job, don't make it obvious. If authoriative sources are right, several lawyers, apparently not knowing any better, submitted applications for what may now be the most sought-after job in Washington, that of special prosecutor in the Iran arms affair. The letters of application have been largely ignored. Instead, the three-judge panel that will select the prosecutor, known formally as an independent counsel, has compiled a list of lawyers so prominent and so busy that they have better things to do than promote themselves for the job."
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"''PRIMES'' and ''Scores'' will soon be joining Cats and Tigers in the lexicon of Wall Street. Just as Cats and Tigers - two of the more popular zero coupon bonds - ''strip'' the interest from the principal of fixed-income securities, Primes and Scores are designed to separate the dividends from stocks. Such stripping of equities has been done before, in 1984 with shares of the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company and last year with Exxon stock. Now the sponsor of those instruments, the Americus Shareowner Service Corporation, plans to offer similar investments for all 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average, dubbing the dividend portion Primes and the rest Scores."
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"Q.We want to convert a large uninsulated barn into a tool shed and studio for year-round use. How can we insulate it without tearing off the exterior clapboard siding? A. Most such barns are unfinished on the inside; that is, the studs are open and exposed, and the inner side of the exterior siding is exposed. If that is the case then all that is necessary is to install regular fiberglass batts from the inside, pressing the batts between the studs."

Put up or shut up. ''And with one of our proposals,'' Dick Moss was saying yesterday, ''we'll find out if George is under instructions not to sign Jack Morris, or has made an agreement not to sign Jack Morris.'' Moss, an attorney for the free-agent right-handed pitcher, naturally wouldn't divulge the details of the offer that he believes the Yankees' principal owner can't refuse. At a guess, maybe Morris will be willing to bet his salary on the outcome of the American League East next season. Not much if the Yankees don't win, but a big number if they do win."
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"The player-ticket policy adopted by National Collegiate Athletic Association members two years ago at the urging of the troubled Southwest Conference is being ignored by many schools.

Despite some enjoyable star turns, however, it was an unimaginative version of the Christmas story - genteel where it should have been jubilant. The production used narration (by Edmund L. Browning, presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church), a jazz group, a small choir, and solo singers and dancers. It added a slight swing to old carols, introduced three new ones and revived Dave Brubeck's jaunty ''God's Love Made Visible.''"
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"MOTHER AND CHILD REVISITED Numerous generations of artists have drawn inspiration from the story of Mary and Jesus, although the mother-and-child theme gets particular attention at this time of year.

''Mother and Child in African Sculpture'' consists of 56 items, on loan from museums in Seattle, Los Angeles, from private West Coast collections, and from museums and private collections in New York.

The 78-page book, published by the Department of Education, was introduced at the White House last September by Nancy Reagan, who wrote a forward for it. The book has been hailed by William J. Bennett, the Secretary of Education, as a major part of the Administration's efforts to educate school children about the dangers of drug abuse. As evidence of the program's success, Mr. Bennett often cited the large number of requests for the book, which was distributed at no charge. The company says that less than 10 percent of the more than 100,000 requests for the book involved fraudulent names."

''I can't see doing it any other way,'' said Ms. Greenaway, a teacher from Lawrenceville, N.J. ''This way it's more like Christmas from their parents.'' Similarly, Jane Marques, who lives with her husband and two daughters in Yonkers, has worked full time since her younger daughter, now 4 years old, was 3 months old. She has never abandoned the customs of baking and decorating and preparing dinner for 11 on Christmas Day. ''The kids have to get the whole show,'' said Ms. Marques, a data processing supervisor who uses her lunch hour to do her shopping. ''By the time Christmas comes, I'm beat.''"

Airports in the region expect 5 to 15 percent more travelers between tomorrow and Jan. 4 than during last year's holiday period. Airline officials said single-day passenger counts could reach the highs many carriers set on Nov. 30, the Sunday after Thanksgiving, usually the most heavily traveled day of the year. The airports - Newark International, La Guardia and Kennedy International - may together spend as much as $1 million in overtime pay for extra police, traffic supervisors and parking lot attendants to try to speed the flow of vehicles and people."
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"The United States Ambassador to Switzerland, Faith Ryan Whittlesey, took the unusual step today of publicly denying a Swiss newspaper report that she had any connection to the diversion of Iran arms payments to Nicaraguan rebels. In a front-page article in the Zurich daily Tages Anzeiger, the paper's Washington correspondent cited United States congressional sources as saying Mrs. Whittlesey would be recalled to Washington in mid-January to answer questions from the House Foreign Affairs Committee on her possible role in the covert arms deals. A possible role by Mrs. Whittlesey in the arms sales has been the subject of public debate here, because Swiss bank accounts were used to funnel some money to the rebels and because as a White House aide she had sought support for the Nicaraguan rebels."

''Democracy is the wish of the party in power; it is also our wish,'' he said. Though he criticized the Aquino Government for not living up to its ideals, his accusations lacked the sharp edge that brought him into confrontation with the President when he was still a member of her Cabinet."

More than 60 speakers were scheduled to address the panel, known formally as the West Side Task Force, at the hearing at the Fashion Institute of Technology.

A number of dealers in the New York City area offer seasoned hardwood logs. Delivery can add appreciably to the cost of keeping a hearth ablaze, but many dealers make free deliveries of minimum orders. However, make certain you have enough room to store the amount of logs you plan to buy.

In recent years I have sought to emphasize this chain of command by stating in my letter to new ambassadors that the line of authority for any action or decision on your part flows from the President to me and from me through the Assistant Secretary to you. Therefore, you will receive instructions only from or through the department. All messages dealing with policy proposals, policy implementation, program activities, personnel and past operations shall be sent through regular established State Department channels. The only two exceptions to this rule are: (1) if the President personally or the national security adviser instructs you to use a private channel; in such cases you should advise me personally (or the Acting Secretary in my absence) of this instruction unless you are explicitly directed not by the President; and (2) if I, or in my absence, the Acting Secretary or the Executive Secretary, instruct you to use a non-State channel."

1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"Short-term interest rates rose sharply yesterday, to the dismay of corporate borrowers, and securities dealers who must finance their inventories. But the move delighted money managers looking for short-term investments. Traders are accustomed to abnormally high short-term rates around the end of the year, but the extent of the recent increases - and the fact they have come so far ahead of year-end - has been surprising. According to many analysts, much of the recent rise in rates has been caused by the desire of commercial banks to borrow money now, so that their needs will be reduced late this month, when history shows that interest rates can rise sharply. Last year, for example, the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market rose to as high as 40 percent on Dec. 31, and averaged 13.46 percent on that day, up from about 8 percent in the previous few weeks."

The proverb is commonly cited by way of saying that a Russian will not rouse himself to action until the last minute, until the crisis is upon him. This trait has repeatedly frustrated Soviet leaders who have tried to impose their will on the people and rouse them to action. Twenty months ago, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, an energetic and capable leader of the postwar generation, came to power vowing to root out this trait, to change the character of the muzhik - meaning in this case the average Russian - and to reverse the decline of a great and richly endowed land through a fundamental and urgent transformation in the way Russians live and work. Call for 'Revolutionary' Change Only a profound, radical and even ''revolutionary'' restructuring, he said again and again, could check the stagnation of the economy, the corruption of the political system, the people's cynicism."

1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"THEY do not advertise it much, but the automobile companies do business with each other all the time. Usually it involves unseen internal components, with the buyer seeking to avoid the cost of designing and tooling for a part on its own and the seller taking advantage of the improved economics of a longer production run. For instance, the head castings for the engines in many Ford Escorts come from Fiat, the Italian car company. The Chrysler Corporation buys engines from the Mistubishi Motor Company for its popular mini-van and other American-made models. Every American Motors Corporation Jeep sold in North America contains a gearbox from Chrysler's New Process Gear division."

The most striking thing about the store, which sells modern home furnishings and accessories, is its facade, a Lego-like assemblage of what look like rusted steel girders. ''Not steel and not rusted,'' said Lewis Dolin, who with his partner, Dr. Giles Forman, opened the shop last Saturday at 464 Columbus Avenue, near 82d Street."

The organization said more than 2,000 of the beds should be removed from some of the city's most prestigious teaching hospitals, most of them in Manhattan. Several of the hospitals have already suffered sharp reductions in the numbers of patients they serve. The recommendations came from the New York City Health Systems Agency. Like others across the country, it was created by Congress in 1975 to cut waste and unnecessary hospital services and to foster the most economical use of public health funds."
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"As winter comes to this lovely old city, still perhaps the most graceful of Arab capitals, there is a mood of uncertainty. The economy is pinched; President Hafez al-Assad, like others before him, is becoming bogged down in Lebanon, and Syrians are beginning to feel the international isolation accorded them over charges of sponsoring terrorism. This has particularly affected the wealthy, who love to travel abroad and now find themselves pounced upon by batteries of customs inspectors. But despite the presence of grim-faced young men wearing blue jeans, leather jackets and submachine guns on the street corners, it is still a welcoming place."

Mr. Andrade was pronounced dead at 12:32 A.M., said Assistant Attorney General Monroe Clayton. Mr. Andrade, 25 years old, who used a pocketknife to murder Cordelia Mae Guevara at a club she managed in Corpus Christi, was the 10th Texas inmate to be executed this year and the 20th since the state resumed executions in 1982. Both figures are the highest in the nation."

Also settled under the agreement were three suits brought by the church against Mr. Flynn. In recent months, the organization has settled at least nine other lawsuits brought against it by former members in Massachusetts and Florida."
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"Suddenly, the worm seems to have turned on welfare. When the Reagan Administration began, it was social welfare liberals who seemed to be out of gas, and ideas.

For his program of songs associated with Cole, Mr. Alexander has augmented his regular group - the bassist John Clayton and the drummer Jeff Hamilton - with two musicians who played with Cole: John Collins, who was the guitarist in the King Cole Trio from 1951 until Cole's death in 1965, and the one-time Count Basie trumpet star, Harry (Sweets) Edison, one of four jazz musicians featured on one of Cole's infrequent jazz albums, made in 1956.

1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS'S concert with the Orchestra of St. Luke's Tuesday night at Carnegie Hall was naturally of interest as the first orchestral program in the refubished hall that was free from the noise and glare of Monday's television lighting. From a strictly musical standpoint, the evening had its virtues without satisfying fully. Mr. Thomas offered a conservative program of Mozart - the ''Paris'' Symphony (K. 297), Mahler (the five ''Ruckertlieder'' with Marilyn Horne) and Beethoven (the ''Eroica'' Symphony). Given the fact that St. Luke's at its largest is an expanded chamber orchestra, only the Mozart was played with the forces normally heard in this music. The Mahler and especially the Beethoven are usually played today by ensembles twice the size of the 50 heard on Tuesday."

Mr. Nickelson had been president of the firm's profitable Consumer Markets division. The promotion of Mr. Nickelson, an avid sportsman who grew up in Kansas and spent years working as a stockbroker in the Southwest, has two aims.

''He was beating me in practice for the last couple days with that kind of a shot,'' said Alain Chevrier, the Devils' goaltender, ''so I told him to use that shot in the game.'' In practice, Sulliman repeatedly used a wrist shot with a defenseman as a screen to beat Chevrier, and tonight it produced his 11th goal and the Devils' 15th victory.

Today in Switzerland, apparently as a result of these and other discoveries, the United States Justice Department asked Swiss officials to freeze nine more bank accounts, including one for a company named Hyde Park Holdings, American and Swiss officials said. Congressional investigators suspect that these accounts were part of the complex financial path through which the American Government was paid for the weapons sold to Iran and the surplus was used for other purposes, including support for the rebels fighting to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government. Officials declined to give details on Hyde Park Holdings, but corporate records in Panama show that a company with that name was chartered in March. It is headed by Mohamed Said Ayas, a Saudi Arabian described by an associate and other Saudi sources as the manager of the business affairs of Prince Mohammed bin Fahd bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud, a son of King Fahd."

The drug is not approved for sale in the United States. The drug, now designated RU 486, for its developer, the Roussel-Uclaf Company, is also under study as a morning-after pill. It acts by blocking the action of the hormone progesterone, which is needed by the uterus to support the development of a fertilized egg. The drug is a steroid that is closely related to norethindrone, one of the oldest and most widely used synthetic contraceptive hormones. No long-term risks have been associated with continuous use of norethindrone, nor are any expected from brief, intermittent use of the new drug."

The elaborate vanities of the era, which acted like adjectives of beauty and femininity modifying anyone who sat before them, gradually fell out of fashion, victims of the Depression, World War II and, later, the trend to practical, modular and minimal furniture. Vanities themselves became a forgotten furniture type. Women simply retreated to the bathroom and made up over the sink. At the peak of their popularity, however, during the 1920's and early 1930's, vanities were extraordinary objects, created by the most gifted designers for some of the great figures of the era."

After years of complaining, months of searching and weeks of political dispute, Chicago has finally decided to replace the aging stadium, which has been the home of the Chicago White Sox for all 76 years of the American League's franchise here. And, perhaps not surprisingly in this present topsy-turvy season of Illinois politics, Chicago has decided that the home team's new home on the city's South Side will be paid for by visitors. The new $120 million stadium is to be financed in part by an increased tax on city hotel rooms, which are usually occupied by out-of-towners who do not often vote here. This means that hotel guests and visiting baseball teams here will find their room bills increased by 12.1 percent, a city hotel tax second only to New York City's."

1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"Eugene Hasenfus is lucky, far luckier than the Reagan Administration he thought he was working for in Nicaragua. He escaped with his life when his cargo plane, loaded with weapons for the contras, was downed in October by Sandinistas. Sentenced to 30 years by a ''people's court,'' he was pardoned yesterday in a shrewdly timed propaganda coup. But his liberation comes at a bedeviling time for President Reagan. His return home serves mainly to remind us of the Administration's growing participation in an unsanctioned war and to draw further attention to Lieut. Col. Oliver North, paymaster and coordinator of the contra crusade."

ACCORDING to ''A World of Watchers,'' a certain ornithologist once defined bird watching as ''a mild paralysis of the central nervous system which can be cured only by rising at dawn and sitting in a bog.'' The remark is amusing but vague. It doesn't begin to explain why there are millions of bird watchers in America today, some 450,000 of whom are enrolled in various affiliates of the National Audubon Society."
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"A State Supreme Court justice in Suffolk County has awarded custody of a 13-year-old boy to his homosexual father. Legal experts said the ruling was the first of its kind in the state. However, the Appellate Division of the court, in Brooklyn, stayed the decision today and ordered the trial judge to consider new facts in the case. The facts, according to the mother's lawyer, Arnold B. Firestone, are that the boy, who is referred to in court papers solely by the initial B., has tried to commit suicide several times. The attorney said the suicide attempts had led to the boy's being hospitalized in a psychiatric institution for adolescents on Long Island."
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"IN a political collective I belonged to in the late 1960's, we had a constant debate: is sexual revolution compatible with feminism? A good many of the women thought not, and a good many of the men thought so. I was part of a rather suspect minority who couldn't make up their minds. A few years later, when doing research on women who wrote in the 17th century, I confronted the issue again by an unexpected route. Countless diaries, memoirs and other records of feminine experience from Elizabethan times to the 19th century convinced me that reputation was probably the greatest influence in a woman's life. Reputation depended upon a modest posture, and ''modesty'' implied chastity. The self-censorship that reputation exercised over women then was far more effective than any external restraint. Young women were taught that modesty ought to inform the way they looked, moved, spoke and gestured. ''Let neither your eyes nor thoughts wander,'' a manual written for their benefit advised."
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation has begun an inquiry into why Attorney General Edwin Meese 3rd ordered a delay in an F.B.I. investigation last fall into arms shipments to Nicaraguan rebels, law enforcement officials said today. One official said the F.B.I. was told at the time that its investigation, into the activities of a company in Miami, could imperil negotiations for the release of American hostages in Lebanon. Mr. Meese's order to the F.B.I. raises the question whether he may have known earlier than he has acknowledged about the diversion of proceeds from secret Iran arms sales to Nicaraguan rebels. Asserts His Lack of Knowledge Today, after appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Meese said his own investigation into the diversion of funds to the Nicaraguan rebels had found nothing beyond his original finding on Nov. 25 that only Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North and Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter had known about the scheme. [ Page A20. ] The attempt to delay the F.B.I. inquiry also raises the question why Mr. Meese would not have asked what the hostages in Lebanon had to do with supplies for the Nicaraguan rebels."

They fell short of an outright endorsement of the plan, saying they wanted to study it further. But privately, leading Republicans said its overall concept was acceptable. Warren M. Anderson, the Senate majority leader, said a key part of the plan ''has a good ring to it.''"
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"FREDERICA VON STADE came to the Museum of Modern Art Sunday evening to sing the recital she had to postpone during the museum's ''Vienna 1900'' series in the fall. At first glance her program looked to have little more connection with that period and place than might have been expected to turn up by chance, but it turns out that Debussy's ''Fetes Galantes'' (Book 1) and Schumann's ''Frauenliebe und -leben'' were interspersed with the works of the adventurous Viennese pioneers on the programs of Arnold Schoenberg's Society for the Private Performance of Music. Here, along with Mahler, early Berg and comic Schoenberg, they formed a program well suited to Miss von Stade's exquisite lyric mezzo-soprano and to the spirit that infuses the best of her singing - though on this occasion the spirit seemed somewhat muted."

On Friday, hours before he defended his World Boxing Association heavyweight title against James (Bonecrusher) Smith, the Internal Revenue Service put a lien on Witherspoon's $300,000 purse for $180,148 in back taxes. Later that night at Madison Square Garden, Smith knocked out Witherspoon at 2:12 of the first round. Now it develops that postfight tests revealed marijuana in Witherspoon's system. There was an identical finding after Witherspoon won the title from Tony Tubbs in January. At the time, he was fined $25,000 and a rematch with Tubbs was mandated."

He was 71 years old and had spent his final days in the Winchester Medical Center near his family farm in Upperville, Va. During the time he led A.T. & T., from 1972 until his retirement in 1979, Mr. deButts led the company through one of its most tumultuous periods. It was a time of vast advances in telecommunications technology; of surprising competition from upstart, feisty competitors, and of relentless attempts by the Government to dissolve A.T. & T. into its component Bell System operating companies."

Program trading, which ordinarily occurs just before the expiration of stock index options, index futures and regular stock options, helped push equities higher both Monday and Tuesday. Yesterday, however, with the three simultaneous expirations coming tomorrow, institutional investors were more inclined to sell stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 13 points on Tuesday, retreated 17.85 points yesterday, to 1,918.31. Stock prices started off the day lower, held steady during most of the middle of the session before encountering selling pressure just before the last hour of trading."

Should Governor Cuomo and Mayor Koch call for another commission to finish that part of the job? Yes. The expiring commission, headed by Columbia University's president, Michael Sovern, offers a list of sound remedies: limits on campaign contributions to officials who dispense public contracts, public campaign financing, merit selection rather than clubhouse selection of judges and greater uniformity and clarity in the rules for public contractors. It also wants party leaders and legislators to stop practicing before the state agencies they so heavily influence, and a state ethics commission to enforce stronger disclosure laws."

Although all surgery has some degree of risk, doctors do not regard the procedure as particularly dangerous. The death rate in a national survey was seven-tenths of 1 percent. It is the second such operation for the 75-year-old President, who underwent prostate surgery in 1967. Perhaps up to 10 percent of men who undergo prostate surgery for the first time will require similar surgery a second time. Urologists are now in a dispute with Federal Medicare and other health insurance officials who say they will pay for only one prostate operation in a person's lifetime."
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"Neutrinos, the most bizarre of subatomic particles, took on a new aura of mystery today with the presentation of information obtained from almost 20 years of monitoring deep within a South Dakota gold mine. The data, described at a meeting of astrophysicists here, could be explained if neutrinos were slightly magnetic, something that current theory rules out. The ability of neutrinos to pass through almost unlimited matter has been attributed in part to their lack of electromagnetic properties. Proof that they carryied a charge would prompt a re-evaluation of many theories of particle physics."

Mr. Hagan, who is to be arraigned Dec. 29, was charged with two counts of felony possessions of firearms, said Daniel Knauss, an Assistant United States Attorney in Tucson. Mr. Hagan led a patrol by 20 members of his group along the border of Mexico and Arizona last Fourth of July weekend.

1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"WOOD is no longer enough for the surface of a stage when earth, sand, sea and turkey feathers are available. ''K2'' brought a glacial mountain to Broadway, Peter Brook had tons of soil delivered to the Vivian Beaumont Theater for ''Carmen'' and Tommy Tune and Twiggy danced in water in ''My One and Only.'' The feathers appeared in Ping Chong's ''Angels of Swedenborg,'' simulating a heavenly cloud on stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. All these and others called for actors (and dancers) to be nimble-footed. The drift toward sand, a cycle that probably began with Edward Albee's ''Seascape,'' continued this season with ''Neon Psalms,'' which took place in a stretch of the Mojave Desert. Currently there is Tina Howe's ''Coastal Disturbances,'' which is situated on a beach on Cape Cod. In the case of ''Coastal Disturbances,'' the beach is essential to the story. One crucial scene calls for the hero, a lifeguard, to bury the heroine up to her head in sand. Watching the show, I wondered where the sand came from - and the difficulty in carrying it up flights of stairs to the Second Stage's upper-story theater. Perhaps it was transported by sand-hands who specialize in scene-sifting."

What the Democrat had envisioned as a quick pilgrimage to Yasnaya Polyana, the homestead of Leo Tolstoy, now loomed on his schedule as a marathon luncheon fete by Communist party officials in nearby Tula, 130 miles south of Moscow. The trip threatened to cut into a meeting here with would-be Jewish emigrants and a bit of ice skating in Gorky Park. Could the luncheon be, ah, shortened? the Senator asked. What if he canceled the trip altogether? Would there be ''political unpleasantness''?"
1986-12-18T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: William J. Stern's sweeping attack on minority business programs is an example of a harmful insensitivity to minority entrepreneurial efforts prevalent in New York City. While enlightened individuals may, with pure motive, debate the merits of such programs, Mr. Stern's position contributes little to such debate. He implies that minority-business programs lure minority individuals into becoming entrepreneurs when they are not interested in being entrepreneurs. As a lawyer, I can assure Mr. Stern that many minority individuals want the chance to own and manage a business and to have reasonable access to business opportunities."

In keeping with his writing habits of four decades, the author of ''The Trip to Bountiful'' and ''Tender Mercies'' whisks us into the fictional small Texas town of Harrison and sets his characters about their diurnal business. ''The Widow Claire,'' a 95-minute anecdote in one act, describes only a single long summer night of 1911. Horace Robedaux (Matthew Broderick), a poor but ambitious 21-year-old about to enroll in a six-week business course in Houston, spends the eve of his departure courting the title character (Hallie Foote), a 27-year-old widow with several suitors and two rambunctious kids.

They live in houses built years ago and are basically quite happy with them and have neither the money nor the inclination to build anew or to undertake major renovations. Fortunately, any homeowner can do a number of things to improve heating efficiency. There are basically two problems to tackle: Be sure your furnace or boiler and your complete heating system are operating at maximum efficiency and make certain that most if not all of the heat generated stays inside where it belongs and is not lost to the outside."

But it's important to remind ourselves of why these activities had to be carried out in secret in the first place. Congress, until its cowardly vote of $100 million in military and nonmilitary assistance this year, had made such aid illegal, reflecting the great popular resistance to financing this war."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The cellist Sharon Robinson will play works by Marcello, Brahms, Bach and Victor Herbert and the New York premiere of Alan Shulman's ''Kol Nidre'' at the 92d Street Y, at Lexington Avenue, tomorrow night at 8. Tickets are $11 to $15. Information: 996-1100."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Numerous educational changes aimed at reducing the role of Federal and state government in local schools will be put into effect on a trial basis in 16 school districts in eight states, William J. Bennett, the Secretary of Education, announced today. The pilot project, developed by the National Governors Association last summer, also urges students, parents and school officials to play a greater role in helping form school policy. Mr. Bennett called the governors' report the ''single most important event in American education in the last several years.''"
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Faced with a sluggish economy and the loss of investment tax incentives, businesses plan to increase capital spending by just two-tenths of 1 percent percent next year, the Commerce Department said today. The small increase would follow a sharp cutback this year."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Some Washington organizations find it almost impossible to make a mailing without also making a statement. The Cato Institute, a research group of libertarian tendencies, has inscribed its holiday card: ''Wishing You Peace and Free Enterprise.''"
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Holding that the State Constitution provides broader protection for freedom of expression than the United States Constitution, the New York Court of Appeals ruled unanimously yesterday that an adult bookstore could not be ordered closed because homosexual and heterosexual sex acts had been committed by customers in the store. The decision, in effect, supersedes a United States Supreme Court ruling that the Erie County District Attorney could legally seek a court order to close the Village Book and News Store in Kenmore, a Buffalo suburb, for a year to prevent ''indecent and illegal sexual acts'' on the premises. The public health code under which the court order was sought calls for a one-year closing. In its ruling yesterday, the state's highest court declared that the Supreme Court decision ''cannot be considered dispositive in determining the scope of this State's constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression.''"
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The Soviet Union's multiethnic character has long been the Government's public boast and its private burden. Although more than 90 separate peoples are listed in the 1985 Soviet statistical yearbook, ethnic Russians and their Slavic cousins continue to dominate the ruling Communist Party. This domination, and three generations of erratic, two-track Communist policies that have sometimes allowed limited scope for ethnic pride and other times have singled out ethnic groups for brutal persecution, have left many of these groups with a festering but not always focused resentment. But in Alma-Ata, the capital of Soviet Kazakhstan, the focus of the resentment that led to riots Wednesday and today seemed clear. A leader strongly identified as a native son of this Moslem republic of 16 million people was ousted from the top political post and replaced by an ethnic Russian."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The jury in the trial of a Manhattan makeup artist accused in the razor slashing of a model last summer began its deliberations last night at State Supreme Court in Manhattan, but failed to reach a verdict. The jury of nine woman and three men began deliberating on the case just before 9 P.M., after a full day of final arguments in the case."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Investor demand for corporate and mortgage securities remained strong enough for investment bankers to offer several new issues yesterday, while prices of Treasury issues were little changed in lethargic trading. In the ''junk bond'' market, officials at Salomon Brothers Inc. said they planned to offer about $700 million of debt secuities today for ANAC Holding and ANAC Merger. The ANAC financing, which will finance the purchase of Revco, a large drugstore company, is the second large junk bond financing of the week, following a $510 million offering of Fruehauf Holdings by Merrill Lynch. Salomon declined to identify the yields for the new issues before the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission was declared effective."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, underwent surgery today at Georgetown University Hospital here for removal of a tumor from the left side of his brain, the hospital said. The tumor, a lymphoma, meaning it involves the lymph system, was presumed to be malignant by medical experts. But the results of tests to determine whether it is cancerous will not be made known until next week. Mr. Casey, who is 73 years old and has been head of the Central Intelligence Agency since the start of the Reagan Administration in 1981, was said to be in stable condition and ''doing well'' after the surgery, which lasted from 7:40 A.M. to 1 P.M., according to a statement by the hospital."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The Giants have a 13-2 record and the Green Bay Packers are 4-11. The Giants have won eight straight games and have clinched their division title. The Packers started the season by losing their first six games, and things have been so bad that they have not won a game in Green Bay. Obviously, the Giants should beat the Packers here Saturday in their final game of the National Football League's regular season. And the Giants should win if they control the Packers' most dangerous weapon -the blitz."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Two suburban police officers were charged today with torturing a 17-year-old suspect with a stun gun, and the district attorney said the entire Huntington Park department was under investigation. ''The Huntington Park Police Department has a record that is frankly an embarrassment to all of law enforcement,'' District Attorney Ira Reiner said at a news conference. The officers, William Lustig Jr., 31, and Robert Rodriguez, 25, were charged with torturing the youth, suspected of theft, to obtain a confession."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"A 73-year-old political administrator who built his career as Hanoi's representative in the south before and after the takeover of Saigon was named head of the Communist Party of Vietnam today. The election of Nguyen Van Linh to the top party post was announced in Hanoi during the closing session of the Sixth Communist Party Congress. It makes him the country's most powerful figure and the first ruler not to be a member of Ho Chi Minh's inner circle. Mr. Linh replaces Truong Chinh, whose resignation as General Secretary of the party was announced Wednesday as part of the most sweeping reorganization of the party leadership in half a century. Five of 13 Politburo members have lost their seats in the last two days."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"A court in Rwanda convicted an American wildlife researcher in his absence today of murdering Dian Fossey, a gorilla expert, at her camp a year ago. The three judges delivered the verdict against the researcher, Wayne Richard McGuire, 34 years old, of Hazlet, N.J. Conviction carries a sentence of death, but Mr. McGuire has returned to the United States, which has no extradition treaty with Rwanda."

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"In the last six years, the apartment building at 215 West 116th Street in Harlem has been sold five times, its price rising from $6,000 to more than $600,000. The fortunes of the building's tenants, meanwhile, have at best held even, and for them, even means miserable. Once luxurious and now forlorn, long ignored but lately desired, 215 West 116th Street offers a dramatic case history of the real-estate speculation that has swept through Harlem since 1980. The number of building sales in Harlem more than doubled in five years, to 1,131 in 1985 from 503 in 1980, according to figures compiled by the Harlem Urban Development Corporation. The average price per building climbed to period. Against such a backdrop, 215 West 116th is not the exception but the rule."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"FOR most of this century, the semiskilled factory worker was the emblem of American labor. The union was his strength, and he came into his salad days in the postwar years, earning for a while a middle-class wage in an almost-tenured job on the assembly line. Then the factory worker lost top billing to the service-sector employee, who accounts today for 75 percent of the nation's 101 million jobholders outside of agriculture. Service employees are not as easy to pigeonhole as factory workers. But any number of experts are trying."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"George Steinbrenner received the Jack Morris offer he ''could not refuse'' today - a one-year contract with an arbitrator to determine the salary - and called it novel and innovative. However, he stopped short of accepting it, saying he would make a decision by noon Friday. Morris, one of baseball's premier pitchers, and Richard Moss, his lawyer, met with Steinbrenner for 70 minutes, then flew to New York to await the decision of the Yankees' owner. Steinbrenner said last week that the prospect of signing Morris as a free agent was tempting, and he seemed tempted following the meeting. But he also raised a serious reservation about the arbitration procedure, and that reluctance could dissuade him from adding the 21-game winner to the Yankees' shaky staff."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The experimental plane Voyager passed the halfway mark yesterday in an attempt circle the globe without refueling. The pilots, Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, were encouraged by new calculations that indicated they would have enough fuel to complete their flight. They soared past the halfway point at 10:30 A.M. over the Indian Ocean, according to Lee Herron, a spokesman for the ground crew. They were 920 miles east of Somalia and traveling at a speed of 108 miles an hour."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: William Safire's column ''The Electronic Informer'' (Dec. 4) states that the Government can wire consenting informants and send them out to tape their conversations with anybody else. In this manner any of us, no matter how much above suspicion, can be overheard by the government and even tempted into commission of a crime. Mr. Safire blames the Supreme Court for making this state of affairs legal. This is not the whole story. If the Supreme Court declines to hold that the Constitution restricts a given police practice, Congress still has the power to enact regulations of its own choosing. Congress could pass a statute that, say, requires a magistrate's initial authorization before an informant could transmit or record a conversation, or try to induce another person to commit a crime. The investigator running the show could be required to prove to the judge that there are reasonable grounds in the first place to believe the target may not be entirely law-abiding."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"For some time visitors accustomed to stopping here in the foothills of the Ozarks to rent canoes to float down the scenic Meramac River have been exposed to a mystery. Traffic bustles along once-quiet Route 19, once-empty storefronts in malls along its shoulders are busy shops now, and from light poles hang banners exclaiming ''Viva Cuba!'' For the many who wonder, Prof. David Hentzel, chairman of the economics department at the nearby Rolla campus of the University of Missouri, has an explanation. ''It's a miracle,'' he says. But that also calls for elaborations, and the many Missourians who played a role are quick to provide them."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,To the Editor: A front-page article by United Press International (Nov. 10) reported our sinking of two Icelandic whaling vessels that are violating the international moratorium on whaling. The final sentence said Sea Shepherd members had been arrested last summer for ''pouring gasoline on seaborne policemen'' in the Danish Faeroe Islands.
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The lymphoma that was removed yesterday from the left side of the brain of William J. Casey, the Director of the Central Intelligence, was once rarely diagnosed. Such diagnosis is now occurring with increasing frequency, but it still makes up only about 2 percent of all brain tumors. Medical experts say it may take several days to determine what, if any, physical and mental deficits the 73-year-old Mr. Casey will suffer on a long-term basis. The lymphoma is presumed to be malignant. Final results of the tests will determine whether the lymphoma is cancerous and what type of lymphoma it is, according to a statement issued at Georgetown Hospital in Washington after Mr. Casey's five-hour operation."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"At first glance Michel Camdessus, the International Monetary Fund's new managing director, seems to resemble no one so much as the man he is succeeding, Jacques de Larosiere. But the similarity is misleading. Both are typical high fliers in the French civil service, brilliant graduates of France's elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration who made their careers in the Finance Ministry. Both climbed to the top, holding the prestigious post of Directeur du Tresor, the Finance Ministry's senior civil service job. They are close in age: Mr. Camdessus is 53 years old, Mr. de Larosiere, 57."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Charles Ryskamp, director of the Pierpont Morgan Library for 17 years, will be the new director of the Frick Collection, beginning next June. He replaces Everett Fahy, the Frick's director since 1973, who will move to the Metropolitan Museum as chairman of its European paintings department. Mr. Ryskamp, who also is a professor at Princeton University, is known in the museum world not only as a first-rate scholar and exhibition organizer but also as a vigorous fund-raiser. Since 1980, while major repair programs costing several million dollars were in progress and more than $1.5 million had to be raised annually for basic operations, the Morgan's endowment has more than tripled, from about $11 million to more than $38 million."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"IN today's art world, Hans Haacke may be not only inevitable but also indispensable. With the money now invested in art, with the growing corporate and political involvement, with a new breed of collector who approaches art as something to display, like jewelry, or barter, like stocks, it is logical that some artists want no part of art making as usual. Of the artists who are determined to preserve their independence, to define art within a social and political context - and to ask, what is it about art and its institutions that is so attractive to political and business interests? - Haacke is the most influential. His mixed-media works are consistent, meticulous, witty and perverse. They are puritanical. They are not flexible. They are not about empathy and doubt."

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"FIRST of all, Christopher Hart was born the year it opened. That was 1948. Then, last year, he saw it at the Old Vic in London and, he said, ''here was the quintessential American backstage story, and the English were having a ball, howling with laughter even though they didn't recognize a lot of the references.'' Not the least of the whole thing was the fact that Mr. Hart's father, Moss Hart, wrote ''Light Up the Sky,'' and that it hadn't been done on a major stage in New York since its original production. As of May 5, it will be back on Broadway, after a seven-week run at Robert Fryer's Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles. Peter Falk, television's ''Columbo,'' who was last seen on Broadway in 1972 in ''The Prisoner of Second Avenue,'' and Elaine Stritch, who was in the 1970 production of ''Company,'' will co-star. Ellis Rabb, whose credits include ''You Can't Take It With You,'' has been signed to direct. Mr. Hart, who was associate producer of ''Blood Knot'' and part of the producing group of ''Song & Dance,'' is putting the whole thing together."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"A group of elected officials yesterday proposed developing a computer system to keep track of city contracts, and the Koch administration responded that it would begin its own version of such a system next week. Administration officials said the Department of Investigation would distribute questionnaires that contractors bidding on jobs worth $100,000 or more would be required to fill out and return."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The death toll in the crash of a Soviet airliner Friday in East Berlin, which carried 82 people, rose to 71 with the death of a 17-year-old East German girl, the state-run East German news agency A.D.N. reported today. An East German Government inquiry Tuesday blamed the pilot, who it said had violated landing rules, for the crash. The entire nine-member Soviet crew died in the crash."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The Pentagon, responding to the Russians' description of how they might attack a space-based missile defense system, said today that ''there are a variety of ways'' in which the system can retain its effectiveness. The Defense Department statement came in reaction to reports about a Soviet book that broadly explained plans to neutralize the proposed missile defense system, known officially as the Strategic Defense Initiative and popularly called ''Star Wars.'' The most significant aspect of the Soviet study may be its emphasis on a direct attack to destroy the defensive shield in the earliest moments of a nuclear war. Such ''defense suppression'' attacks are different from countermeasures meant to insure that long-range nuclear weapons can penetrate or evade the missile defenses that may eventually be deployed by the United States."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"He still has some soreness from his encounter with the police in Tampa, Fla., Saturday night, but Dwight Gooden's spirits were reported to have been buoyed yesterday by an outpouring of public support and the start of Federal inquiries into his charges of police brutality. ''I've had more than 500 calls from Dwight's fans in New York - half of them from whites - offering to help him any way they can,'' said Bob Gilder, the head of the Tampa chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ''And when I told Dwight about them, his eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. He's very appreciative.'' Gilder met with Gooden during the day. He said the Mets' star pitcher was also cheered that the local office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had begun an inquiry into his charges of police brutality and that an official from the Department of Justice's Community Affairs division in Miami had been sent to Tampa to conduct a separate investigation into the circumstances surrounding the arrest of Gooden and four companions late Saturday night."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Reflecting deep divisions between the chairman and the two new members of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the agency voted today to extend for only two and a half months a limit on direct investments in real estate development by thrift institutions. The action extended a regulation, first passed in January 1985, that restricts to a maximum of 10 percent of assets the investments in real estate development by savings and loan associations. Thrift institutions can seek approval from the bank board to exceed the limit. The direct investment regulation, as it is called in the industry, has been bitterly debated for months, pitting the more aggressive members of the industry against more traditional lenders that tend to concentrate on home mortgage lending and not real estate development."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"''Who authorized it, how broadly knowledge of it extended within the United States Government and to what uses such funds were actually put, I cannot say, and I do not believe the committee has sufficient evidence to be able to draw firm conclusions.'' - Senator Patrick J.

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The International Business Machines Corporation said yesterday that it would take a charge of $250 million or more in the fourth quarter because of the early retirement of 10,000 workers. The computer giant also said it saw ''no signs of improvement'' in its business conditions worldwide. I.B.M.'s stock dropped $1.375 yesterday, to $125.375, on the New York Stock Exchange."

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"ANTIQUES collectors this holiday season are shopping for American and European period furnishings in new places that are upstairs, in town-house settings and hidden away in converted mansions. This is because antiques dealers are on the march again - moving northward and into more discreet spaces, where their presence is acknowledged by little more than a sign on the door. In recent months, three major New York dealers - Stair & Company, Juan Portela and Margot Johnson - have relocated in uptown spaces. Two others -Jordan Volpe Gallery and Bernard and S. Dean Levy - have announced that they will follow suit in 1987. The decisions to relocate were motivated in every case by real-estate concerns and a desire for more suitable addresses on the Upper East Side. Each dealer's strategies were, however, as different as the merchandise they stock and the style of the galleries they operate."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The head of Agence France-Presse resigned today after an eight-day strike by journalists that brought the agency virtually to a halt.

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The White House chief of staff and a former national security adviser today stood by their contradictory accounts of when President Reagan approved Israel's sale of American arms to Iran in 1985. The issue, involving testimony by Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan and Robert C. McFarlane, is important because Mr. Reagan and other current Administration officials have said the President did not approve Israel's arms sales in advance. Only in January 1986 did he sign a special finding approving such sales. Mr. McFarlane, the former national security adviser, insists that Mr. Reagan gave oral advance approval for the Israeli arms shipments. The extent of the President's involvement at the beginning of the arms deals 16 months ago was one of the issues left unresolved today as the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded its closed hearings and the House Intelligence Committee neared the end of its separate investigation."

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, the Washington Square Church, 135 West Fourth Street, will present benefit concerts for the institute. Tonight's program features traditional and Celtic music by the group Nightnoise, which includes some of the most respected musicians in the flourishing Celtic music movement. Triona Ni Dhomhnaill (vocals, clavinet, synthesizer) and Micheal O'Domhnaill (guitar, vocals) are both veterans of the Bothy Band, the seminal Celtic revival group. The quartet is rounded out by the violinist Billy Oskay and the jazz flutist Brian Dunning. The Clan, which shares the bill with Nightnoise, makes Irish folk-rock that is stylistically descended from Steeleye Span and Fairport Convention. Tomorrow night, Inkhay, Aires Colombianos and the duo of Jeff Rehab and Tiberio Nascimento will be on the program. Those groups will present music of South America. Admission each night costs $12. The number for more information is 362-3366."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"CLIVE DONNER, the British director, has come up with one television ''classic'' in the production of ''A Christmas Carol,'' starring George C. Scott as Scrooge. He is evidently trying for a second with ''Babes in Toyland,'' the new three-hour movie having its debut on NBC tonight at 8. Made in West Germany as a co-production of the Finnegan/Pinchuk Company, Orion Television and Bavaria Atelier G.m.b.H., this is still another reworking of the operetta by Victor Herbert and Glen MacDonough. Say this for the new effort: it is no worse than the 1961 movie that starred Tommy Kirk and Annette Funicello. That one lasted 105 minutes. On the other hand, Mr. Donner's ambitious production is not nearly as diverting as the 1934 Laurel and Hardy interpretation. That one originally ran for 79 minutes. Perhaps when it comes to certain kinds of ''family entertainment,'' less really is more."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Iran-contra affair or not, says the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, he still wants a nuclear arms pact with the United States and is prepared to make further compromises. ''Propaganda,'' the State Department was quick to snort. Too quick."

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Consistency may be the most desired but least achieved aspect of play in football. That's why the Chicago Bears, who are 13-2 heading into their final game of the regular season against the Dallas Cowboys, deserve special mention. The Bears have an 11-yard lead on the Atlanta Falcons in rushing yardage for the season, and if they can maintain their advantage they would be the National Football League's best rushing team for the fourth consecutive year. No team has done that since the Bears of 1939 through 1942. Through 15 games, the Bears have rushed for 2,539 yards; the Falcons, 2,528."

The annual New York appearances by the singing and songwriting sisters from Canada are spontaneous folk musicales that cover a lot of territory. Life's joys, frustrations and contradictions are discussed in songs that run from the plaintive (Anna McGarrigle's ''Heart Like a Wheel'') to the whimsical (Kate's ''Move Over Moon'') to the profound (Anna's ''Sun, Son''). The sisters' original hymns, and inspired taste in cover versions (Bob Seger's ''You'll Accompany Me''), and traditional French songs help give their concerts an aura of timelessness. Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 and 11:30 P.M., and tickets are $10. Fats Domino, the Lone Star Cafe, 61 Fifth Avenue, at 13th Street (242-1664). The 57-year-old rock-and-roll pioneer and New Orleans musical giant brings his classics ''Blueberry Hill,'' ''Ain't That a Shame,'' ''Blue Monday,'' ''I'm Walking'' and others to the relative intimacy of the Lone Star Cafe. The chemistry of the club's friendly atmosphere and Fats Domino's rollicking good-humored music ought to stir up enough warmth to heat up the chilliest December evening. Shows are at 9:30 and midnight tonight. Tickets are $25."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"CHOUCROUTE ALSACIENNE, that gutsy gastronomic antifreeze from northeastern France, has been on my 10 most-wanted list for some time now. Following a tip-off from a self-appointed expert on this homey combination of smoked sausages, pork chops, sauerkraut and potatoes, I stopped by Voulez-Vous, a smart and hospitable French restaurant on First Avenue at 76th Street. Sure enough, the choucroute is a delight, combining all of the above ingredients - in quantities to sate a ravenous mountain climber - plus a section of succulent smoked chicken and a few juniper berries in the sauerkraut to lend a nice sharp aftertaste ($14.50). Try it with a glass of crisp Sancerre ($16 a bottle, from Fournier)."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Are you a sophisticated single man over 50? Do you do a nifty tango or fox trot and have a way with women? Well, you might have a chance to become part of a new growth area in the travel industry. The scarcity of older men, as compared with older women, on cruise ships is encouraging the lines to provide male escort or ''charming host'' services. The men are paid for their time or given free passage in exchange for acting as partners to women on the ballroom floor, joining them for a drink in the bar, playing cards or other deck games, exchanging light banter or accompanying the women on shore excursions, especially into less savory ports of call. ''The women get a little antsy when there aren't many men around, especially on longer cruises,'' said Nancy Swasey, speaking for the Royal Viking Line, one of the companies now offering this feature. The Royal Cruise Line also promotes a host service. The Cunard Line incorporates such tasks into the duties of the older men who are added to the regular social staff on world cruises ''to give an extra layer of service,'' said Susan Alpert of Cunard. The three lines hired a total of 300 hosts this year. Other lines are said by industry officials to encourage their senior crew members to mingle with single women on board."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Reagan Administration officials are divided over the significance of three new radars under construction on the western periphery of the Soviet Union. Defense Department officials have proposed that the United States formally assert that the Soviet Union is preparing a nationwide defensive missile system, which is not allowed by the antiballistic missile treaty of 1972. The State Department is resisting such an accusation, saying the Pentagon exaggerates the significance of the western radars. The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency also takes exception to the Pentagon position, but takes the view that the new radars warrant scrutiny, officials said."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The Communications Workers of America, perhaps more than any other major union in the country, has made lifetime employment security a key goal at the bargaining table.

''There's no question that job security has replaced wages and benefits as the focus of collective bargaining in the 1980's,'' said Mark de Bernardo, a labor law specialist with the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''But the jury is out whether they can implement that strategy.''"

Anthony, Democrat of Arkansas, was nominated today to be chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which raises money for the party's House candidates.

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Wetlands and peat bogs that often contain splendidly preserved ancient human remains and other artifacts are reported to be endangered worldwide. They are threatened by development and the sinking level of water under the ground, according to archeologists from around the world who met here over the last weekend. ''The lowering of water levels around the world is the biggest archeological catastrophe in the 20th century,'' said Michael Egloff, an archeologist from the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland, who was one of those attending the international conference on wetlands archeology at the University of Florida. Because of Switzerland's need for agricultural development, Mr. Egloff said that country had only a few remaining undisturbed wetland sites that could nurture fragile organic materials for thousands of years by excluding oxygen, preventing disintegration. The peat also has chemicals that preserve animal and vegetable tissue."

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"There was no joy in the New Brighton section of Staten Island seven years ago when the Staten Island Hospital pulled up stakes and moved to a new building miles away. The fear of neighboring homeowners was that the hospital's departure would leave a derelict property in their midst. And so it did, until this year. In the interim, the property changed hands three times. At one point, the late Robert Olnick, a major developer based in Manhattan, tried to redevelop it as condominiums. But he backed away, according to associates, when he found a lack of enthusiasm among Staten Island banks for providing financing in the area."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Mark Gastineau made an unusual admission yesterday - he feels vulnerable. The Jets' strongman, whose remarkable physique, quickness and durability led him in previous years to the Pro Bowl as the league's top sacker, blamed his problems this season on being overweight. Gastineau has played in only 10 of the 15 games this season and has only two sacks. Gastineau has been out of action for a month because of arthroscopic knee surgery, and although he is eligible to return for the game Sunday against the Bengals in Cincinnati, he will not be activated until the playoffs."

The dissident, Naum Meiman, said today that Senator Gary Hart, in a meeting with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Tuesday, was informed that his wife, Inna Kitrosskaya Meiman, would be allowed to leave. Mr. Shevardnadze reportedly did not say how soon she would be given an exit visa. Mrs. Meiman suffers from an inoperable tumor on her neck.

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"As he left home today shortly after 6 A.M., Col. Oliver L. North encountered one of the camera crews that have followed his every public move since the Iran crisis first became known. Colonel North, perhaps stung by Nancy Reagan's recent comments about the crisis, was more talkative today than usual, even turning to Bible quotations to explain his position to a CBS News reporter. In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Mrs. Reagan said Colonel North, a former White House aide, should come forward and testify about his part in the arms sale to Iran and the subsequent diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels. He has so far refused to testify, citing his constitutional right against self-incrimination. Here are excerpts from the CBS News interview: Q. What would you say to Nancy Reagan?"
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"FOR several years, Christian Delouvrier has been a gastronomic George Bush to his own celebrated commander-in-chef, Alain Senderens of the venerable Lucas-Carton in Paris. In 1983, Mr. Senderens was hired as a periodic menu consultant to boost the reputation of Maurice, the French restaurant in the Hotel Parker Meridien on West 57th Street. He garnered most of the applause while his man in the trenches, Mr. Delouvrier, dutifully carried out orders. The Senderens connection ended last year, and Mr. Delouvrier parted with him. After a year of dallying with other consulting chefs, the restaurant finally asked Mr. Delouvrier to take the top spot on his own - and a smart move it was. In a short time he has whipped his crew into fighting shape and led them to exciting new heights, transforming Maurice into one of the preeminent luxury restaurants in New York. The dining room is still sumptuous and comfortable: it has a soaring ceiling, mirrored wall panels alternating with flowered murals, a resplendent cluster of illuminated white birch branches in the center, and generously spaced tables. Oriental-style rugs and upholstered banquettes help keep background noise to a minimum."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"State and city officials said yesterday that they would investigate why it took a week for a Brooklyn family to find out that their son had died in a hospital emergency room. The son, Eric Washington, an 18-year-old from the Brownsville section, was taken from his family's apartment by ambulance late on the night of Dec. 8. The youth, who had a chronic asthma condition, was suffering an acute attack, his parents said. Results of an autopsy are still pending."

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The Soviet Union announced today that it would end its halt of nuclear testing as soon as the United States conducts its first test in 1987. A statement issued by the Government press agency Tass said that the Russians were prepared to halt testing again ''any day of any month'' if the United States were to reciprocate. Tass said that the Soviet Union's decision to end the test halt was forced by ''grave danger'' to its national security posed by the continuing American testing program. [ In Washington, a White House spokesman said: ''Whether or not the Soviets resume their nuclear testing is their business. Acceptance of the Soviet nucler testing moratorium is not in the security interests of the U.S. or our friends and allies.'' ] Soviet Test Halt Began in 1985 The Soviet Union stopped testing in August 1985 and called on the United States to join in and negotiate a permanent ban on underground testing, the only kind permitted since the 1963 treaty on a partial test ban prohibited explosions in the atmosphere, under water and in outer space."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"President Reagan has ordered emergency shipments of up to $15 million in military equipment to help the Chadian Army repel attacks by Libyan troops, the State Department announced today. The department said Mr. Reagan's action was in response to an urgent request from the Government of Chad. The shipments, under the terms of the Foreign Assistance Act, do not require Congressional approval. The department's spokesman said the effort was being coordinated with France, which is also sending help to the Chadian Army."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The military said today that three people had been killed and two others wounded when Communist rebels attacked a bus. It was the most serious accusation so far that the rebels had violated a eight-day-old cease-fire. Bishop Antonio Y. Fortich, head of a bipartisan monitoring panel, said the incident, in which the military said two rebels were among the dead, ''could be a serious violation'' if confirmed."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Senator Albert Gore Jr. yesterday made public his order for a Congressional investigation into whether Dr. James C. Fletcher, head of the space agency, violated conflict-of-interest rules in awarding the contract for shuttle rockets that proved flawed and led to the Challenger disaster. The inquiry, being conducted by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, is to focus on possible violations of a Presidential order on conflicts of interest as well as Federal laws on Government acquisitions and on Federal advisory committees. Dr. Fletcher, who first served as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from 1971 to 1977, awarded the contract in 1973 to Morton Thiokol Inc., then known simply as Thiokol, of Brigham City, Utah. Dr. Fletcher was reappointed to head NASA after the Challenger disaster Jan. 28, in which a leaky booster made by Thiokol touched off the explosion that killed seven astronauts. Denial of Favoritism Critics have charged Dr. Fletcher with favoritism in awarding the rocket contract to a Utah concern. While vigorously denying any bias, Dr. Fletcher has said he would ''seriously consider'' removing himself from any future decisions on shuttle booster contracts."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"IAN MCKELLEN is always exciting to watch, and there's a lot of him to watch in ''Wild Honey,'' Michael Frayn's ingenious new adaptation of Chekhov's first extant play. As Platonov, a village schoolmaster in provincial 19th-century Russia, the English actor spends much of the second act juggling four women (one of them his wife) while simultaneously fending off a legal action, a galloping case of the d.t.'s and a halfhearted murder attempt or two. His pants drooping, his face filthy and unshaven, his mouth gummy, Mr. McKellen has the clotted sound of James Mason's Norman Maine and looks like a derelict Pierrot on speed. If he isn't rocking in a low chair that wasn't meant to rock or undulating elastically like a human Slinky, he may well be crawling on the floor in a soiled blanket, assuming the shape of a huge mutant snail."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The Soviet Union has begun telling some Western European governments that it is prepared to join forces in combating terrorism, according to highly placed West German officials. Some experts detect Soviet concern that it and its allies are becoming overly identified with terrorist movements - and that terrorist organizations could pose long-term problems for Soviet interests. One senior West German official said that two recent trials in London and West Berlin, suggesting strongly that Syrian intelligence agents were embroiled in terrorist outrages, had prompted the latest overture, which he said had taken place in Moscow several weeks ago."

The program, announced by Dorcas Hardy, Commissioner of Social Security, is part of the Reagan Administration's plan for administering the new immigration law, which prohibits employers from hiring illegal aliens. Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, who joined Ms. Hardy in making the announcement, said the program would help employers avoid criminal sanctions for such hiring."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"THE American Telephone and Telegraph Company's announcement yesterday that it would take a pretax charge of $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter will weaken the price of the company's stock in the short run, according to several analysts. But the austerity moves promise to substantially benefit the telecommunications giant and strengthen the stock's price over the long term, these experts believe. ''A.T.&T.'s announcement was widely anticipated and should be viewed positively from a long-term prospective,'' said Harold A. Mackinney, head of the investment policy committee at the Fleet Financial Group in Providence, R.I. ''Reduced costs should allow for a modest increase in earnings in 1987,'' he added, ''and the current $1.20 annual dividend appears safe. In the mid-20's, with a yield of 4.8 percent, the stock is fairly valued.''"

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"THE Christmas that is famous in New York is the Fifth Avenue one - with the immense illuminated snowflake at 57th and Fifth, the Christmas tree and ice-skating rink at Rockefeller Center, and the Empire State Building decked out in green and red. The scale is imperial, and people come from all over the world to see it. But in pockets scattered throughout New York, there is a less obvious, much smaller Christmas of one-man shops, narrow streets, brick houses and eccentric personalities. In these pockets, old neighborhoods that are still physically intact perpetuate 19th-century patterns of socializing - a village life within the larger city - and, during December, a Christmas season that seems antique. It is, to some extent, a shopkeeper's season, characterized by conversations over the counter and individualistic goods chosen by the people who own and run the shops. By stepping into certain stores, a visitor encounters self-contained worlds created by their owner-proprietors. Browsing among shops is a way of entering the spirit of an older holiday."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"More than a third of the members of the New York Philharmonic refused to play at a free concert at a Harlem church last week because a minister of the church would not denounce the Black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan. Most of those who declined to participate were Jewish, although another Jewish musician, the violinist Isaac Stern, decided to perform as a soloist. Forty-one of the 106 players boycotted the performance, on Dec. 9 at the Abyssinian Baptist Church at 131 West 138th Street. Several substitute musicians were hired."

Indeed, the public apathy we have decried may itself be one of the crippling effects of the mistrust and cynicism that corruption breeds. Much was revealed at the trial of Stanley Friedman and his co-defendants. Much more will presumably be revealed in future trials."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"A private plane crashed north of Houston today, killing the pilot, slicing power lines and leaving about 30,000 customers without electricity for two and a half hours. The identity of the pilot and the cause of the crash were not immediately known."

He was exhausted and his knees were badly battered, but he would not give up. So the paramedics and bystanders fastened a strap under his arms and around his chest with which to hold him up while he crawled on. Finally he reached the basilica, made his way up the steps and into the crush of humanity inside - still on his knees - and prayed to the Virgin of Guadalupe."

But it offered to halt testing again if Washington agreed to reciprocate."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"OPEC ministers inched closer today to an agreement to curb oil production, but it appeared that any accord would exempt Iraq. The plan under discussion by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries calls for a 7 percent reduction in total output, aimed at pushing the price of crude oil toward $18 a barrel. ''We will not be part of that agreement,'' Qassim Ahmed Taki, Iraq's oil minister, said today. OPEC officials would not discuss whether the 7 percent reduction would be made from the temporary, reduced levels agreed to in August and October or from the previous quotas."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The Thatcher Government ended its long and controversial search for an airborne early-warning defense system today by rejecting Britain's own Nimrod aircraft and announcing a billion-dollar decision to purchase Boeings from the United States. The decision maintains the dominance of the Boeing Company's Awacs in the lucrative airborne surveillance field - the use of elaborate command-post aircraft fitted with the latest in radar, computers and other detection gear to track enemy movements. An estimated $7 billion world market looms for such planes in the next decade, and the Nimrod represented the best effort of the British industry, once a leader in aircraft innovation, to crack the market and guarantee thousands of skilled jobs. Bitterness in Commons The bitterness of the failure was reflected quickly in the House of Commons when Defense Secretary George Younger announced the decision to purchase the first six Awacs, with an option for two more."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Anatoly T. Marchenko, who died in prison last week, was not an ordinary Soviet dissident. The son of illiterate railroad workers, he did not emerge from the ranks of disgruntled writers and scientists or oppose the regime because of ethnic or religious persecution. Mr. Marchenko was first arrested, in 1959, in connection with a brawl in a workers' hostel. He escaped confinement and tried to cross the Soviet border into Iran but was soon caught again and tried for treason. He was given a six year term.

Gerald Cantor Roof Garden, which is to open at the museum in May. Though, as Howard Lutnick put it, ''Some of Bernie's best friends are major institutions,'' only close relatives and friends were invited.

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The decision by Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent has spurred debate on whether President Reagan can legally force them to abandon those rights - or should at least try to persuade them to do so. The first question is primarily one of law: Does the President, as Commander-in-Chief, have authority to order active-duty officers to give possibly incriminating testimony about their official actions on matters of great public importance, on pain of demotion, dismissal or even court-martial if they refuse? The second question goes to the ambiguous place of the privilege against self-incrimination in the nation's hierarchy of values. Some see it as a bedrock principle of liberty, invocation of which should never be penalized or even criticized; others see it as a limited safeguard against official abuse, to be treated grudgingly because it often shields criminals and hides the truth."

Though Miss Mary is played with a good deal of intelligence by Miss Christie, the character doesn't make a perfect periscope through which to examine such a complex social-political scene. Miss Mary's vision of the world is as clouded as the audience's understanding of her. She's a function of the film, rather than its reason for being."

The contacts included a controversial trip to Libya last year by the United States Ambassador to the Vatican, which was arranged with the help of the Italian Government on the assumption that the trip had been approved by the White House, according to Italian officials. Both White House and State Department officials have previously denied that the Ambassador, William A. Wilson, was authorized to carry out contacts with Libya. Today, the State Department repeated its statement that the trip by Mr. Wilson, was unauthorized."

North had never met alone, there was a shudder of relief among Republican Party officials and Reagan loyalists. But there was intense disappointment in some offices in New York and Hollywood, where agents, producers and publishers are sketching out scenes of high drama that could result in book and movie deals on the Iran crisis. Indeed, one New York literary agent who preferred to remain anonymous hopes that Mr. Regan, the White House chief of staff, turns out to be wrong about a meeting between the President and Colonel North, the National Security Council aide who was dismissed for his role in the arms sales and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels. A Rambo in the Oval Office ''It would make a tremendous movie scene with the President and this sort of Rambo sitting by the fire in the Oval Office,'' the agent said excitedly. ''Imagine North telling the President: 'I'm the guy who got the fellows off the Achille Lauro for you. I'm the guy who got Arab terrorists captured for you. Now I have an even better stunt to help the hostages and the contras. Don't worry, just leave it to me.'"

Yuri A. Izrael, chairman of the Soviet State Committee for Hydrometeorology and Control of the Natural Environment, said his country did not think there was sufficient evidence yet demonstrating the need to limit production of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals that destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere.

The investigation of the Iran arms deal, these conservatives argue, has offered the President's liberal foes an opportunity long denied them - a chance to humble Mr. Reagan and undo his political revolution. ''We recognize that this battle is being fought under the name of truth, but that's not the issue,'' argued Richard Viguerie, the conservative activist. ''These people want to undo the election results. They want to institute Walter Mondale's vision of America and not Ronald Reagan's.''"

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Michel Camdessus, the French Government's top banker, was named managing director of the International Monetary Fund today, ending an uncommon spectacle of open campaigning by two nations for a position of power over the world economy. Mr. Camdessus (pronounced COM-de-sue) was elected unanimously by the 22-member executive board of the 151-nation lending institution, succeeding another Frenchman, Jacques de Larosiere. But he was named only after barely winning a straw vote Wednesday over the Finance Minister of the Netherlands, H. Onno Ruding. Mr. Ruding withdrew from the race just before today's vote. Mr. Camdessus, who is 53 years old, joins the I.M.F. at a moment of acute tensions over a relatively weak world economy and the seemingly intractable loan payment problems of developing debtor nations. The I.M.F. attempts to help those countries, but also tries to discipline them by requiring sometimes severe economic restraint."

The billboards on cloth brought a deserved stir among the spectator fleet, for they marked the end of a pristine era in which advertising, allowed during practice, had been banned from America's Cup yachts during actual competition. The beginning of that end came last month when the International Yacht Racing Union decided to give individual organizers the right to decide the issue. Since the Fremantle trials were already under way with a ban in force, officials decided to leave it that way."

Certainly not to drivers who must use these links to get to and from work each day. They, as individuals, are already bearing the heaviest burden of the present subsidy while paying one of the highest bridge and tunnel tolls in the country.

The Honduran public is reported to be increasingly discontent that the border is dominated by Sandinistas. There is no doubt that the residents of the area who have had to leave their lands and homes because of the conflict between the contras, who are based there, and the Sandinistas pursuing them would like both groups out, permanently.

A few intrepid biologists have built tree platforms to observe the canopy's profusion of flowers, birds, reptiles and insects.

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"NO American actor can match Richard Gere in making grandiose and often unreasonable claims for himself with each new role. From ''King David'' to the remake of ''Breathless,'' Mr. Gere has consistently demonstrated more confidence in his own magnetism than anyone else seems to feel. Yet there are times when the perception of Mr. Gere as a tough-talking, quietly mesmerizing figure, a man of keen and unpredictable longings, seems wholly justified, and his latest film is one of them. ''No Mercy'' is a passionate film noir that depends heavily upon Mr. Gere to give it credence, and Mr. Gere delivers. ''No Mercy,'' which opens today at the Warner Twin and other theaters, casts the actor as Eddie Jillette, a Chicago policeman, and throws him into as many different settings and adventures as can be crammed into an hour and three-quarters. He is seen, for instance, working at a car wash, party-crashing at a mansion, working his way out of an underwater prison and roaming the Louisiana bayous with a beautiful captive handcuffed to his wrist. And that's only the start of it. Excessive as it sometimes is, ''No Mercy'' also has energy to spare."

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"President Reagan's draft budget for the next fiscal year proposes sharp cuts in Federal spending for veterans' health care benefits. Confidential budget documents show that the Office of Management and Budget is seeking to virtually eliminate medical benefits for veterans with income exceeding $15,000 a year and for married veterans with income above $18,000. To obtain Government medical care, such veterans are already subject to certain criteria specified by a law that took effect last spring. Before that, Veterans Administration institutions could provide free health care to veterans 65 years old or older without regard to their ability to pay for such care."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Jocelyn Lemieux, the rookie wing for St. Louis Blues who was the Blues' top draft choice this year, will be sidelined for up to six weeks because of a tendon he cut in his small left finger in an accident during the team's Christmas skating party. The mishap occurred Wednesday night when the 19-year-old Lemieux fell and a skate cut his hand. The cut was repaired and the finger was placed in a splint."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Not prompted by any crying need, but perhaps with an eye toward another deal, the Rangers acquired Bob Froese from the Philadelphia Flyers yesterday to be their backup goalkeeper. In return, the Rangers sent Kjell Samuelsson, a defenseman, to the Flyers along with a second-round pick in the 1989 draft. The trade seemed to have created a number of new questions. What now will be the role of Doug Soetaert, who has been the No. 2 goalie? How does this affect the team's plans, announced just this week, to abandon a platoon system at goal and to give John Vanbiesbrouck more work?"

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,To the Editor: Your thoughtful Dec. 4 article about the efforts of New York City high schools to prepare students for a changing job market did not give some important reasons for optimism about this city's economic future. The decline in the youth population that you say is taking place in other parts of the country is also occurring in New York. A drop of a quarter of a million people in the 15-to-24 age category is expected in the next 14 years.

Otherwise, officials say, they will not be permitted to enter the country. The Government has also started giving blood tests for AIDS antibodies to foreign students already in residence, the Ministry of Health announced. The presence of such antibodies indicates exposure to the AIDS virus and probable continuing infection with it, but not whether a person has the fatal disease or will develop it."

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"WHO could have imagined that ''Little Shop of Horrors,'' the 1960 comic horror film shot by Roger Corman in two days' time, would continue to grow bigger, mightier and more formidable, much like the man-eating plant that is its unsung star? From Mr. Corman's charming throwaway film to the Off Broadway stage success, ''Little Shop of Horrors'' has evolved into a full-blown movie musical, and quite a winning one. As directed by the Muppet master Frank Oz, this large-scale new film version has just the right mixture of playfulness, tunefulness and blood lust. Never has any screen killer done his job as innocently as Seymour Krelborn (Rick Moranis), the florist's assistant who tries so hard to accommodate the large, potted creature living in the basement of his ''God- and customer-forsaken'' shop that he cannot help thinking of passers-by as plant food."

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The Soviet Union reported today that there had been an outbreak of anti-Russian rioting in the capital of the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan. A report by the official press agency Tass said a group of students ''incited by nationalistic elements'' took to the streets of Alma-Ata Wednesday night and today, burning cars and setting fire to a food store to protest decisions made earlier this week by the republic's Communist Party organization. On Tuesday the Kazakhstan Party Central Committee ousted its longtime leader, Dinmukhamed Akhmedovich Kunayev, a Kazakh, replacing him with an ethnic Russian, Gennadi V. Kolbin. City Services Called Normal The Tass dispatch from Alma-Ata reported that city services were functioning normally, but stopped short of saying that the unrest had been quelled. It did not report any injuries or deaths."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In a report on what the United States is doing to remedy deficiencies in foreign-language study (front page, Dec. 2), you quote the executive director of the Joint National Committee of Languages as saying, ''We have a long way to go until we see the end of the tongue-tied American.'' The implication of this and other comments in the article is that greater emphasis on foreign-language study in our schools will result in more Americans being able to converse and write in foreign languages. However, the problem of the so-called tongue-tied American does not solely result from a dearth of foreign-language courses in our high schools and colleges, and it may not even be half-ascribable to that purported dearth."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"A business associate of two Canadians who helped finance secret United States arms shipments to Iran has been identified here as a major figure in the World Anti-Communist League, which is believed to have raised at least $10 million to aid Nicaraguan rebels. The associate, John Gamble, told reporters last week that he knew nothing about the secret arms deals with Iran that were financed in part by his business partners here, Ernest Miller and Donald Fraser. But his involvement in the Anti Communist League seemed likely to raise questions about whether the Canadian investors knew that part of Iran's payment for the weapons was being diverted to the Nicaraguan rebels."

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"THE art world abounds in conspiracy theories, not all of which are paranoid. Yet some of the coincidences nourishing such theories make the scene look less like the court of the Borgias than an orchestra responding to a conductor whom the public cannot see. The maestro raises his baton and, lo! the galleries are showing paper works or Neo-Expressionism or Outsider Art or even, as in the case of a current coincidence, the Great Outsider himself, Jean Dubuffet (1901-1985). Normally, two simultaneous Dubuffet shows would not get a rating on the Richter scale of coincidences. Though Chicago was the first to register the impact of this artist, it was in New York that he made his debut (three years after his maiden solo in the Paris of 1944) and he rarely missed a season here. Besides, it has been only five years since the Guggenheim celebrated his 80th birthday with its ''Retrospective Glance.'' What is remarkable is that the current productions, one at Gallery Urban, 500 Park Avenue, at 59th Street, the other at the Elkon Gallery, 18 East 81st Street, should complement each other so well despite having been independently staged."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The Canadian Government today proposed laws expected to foster a broad restructuring of the country's financial institutions. A policy paper to be translated into legislation in 1987 would relax the ownership barriers that have kept separate the ''four pillars'' of Canadian finance - banks, trust and loan companies, insurance companies and securities dealers. The move will open the way for the networking of financial services through a single parent corporation, with the exception of insurance retailing. At the same time, new restrictions will be introduced to counter the growing trend in Canada toward common ownership of commercial and financial institutions."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Although nothing much ever happens in pro football between weekends, we keyboard warriors must spend our midweek labors trying to sift through the ''test of character'' blather so indigenous to this sport. It has long been my contention that every writer should be limited to one blood-and-guts pronouncement per football season. This is mine for the entire season, first and last: The Jets must win Sunday in Cincinnati. If they don't, they might as well not play their playoff game. That simple."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"ALICE NEEL, who died in October 1984 at the age of 84, was in her last years a well-known fixture of the New York art scene, an eccentric personality and an equally eccentric portraitist of undeniable power. Right now, there is an extensive survey of drawings (in pencil, ink and pastel) and watercolors dating from the late 20's to the mid-60's, plus a room of 30's paintings on view at the Robert Miller Gallery (41 East 57th Street). This show, which runs through Jan. 3, simultaneously reveals the foundation of Neel's achievement and expands her stature considerably, for it gives her a serious historical position prior to the onset of Abstract Expressionism. In the process, the exhibition shows us Neel the young artist and, since she frequently drew and painted her friends, children and lovers, it also shows us Neel the young woman. The youthful normalcy of this woman, seen as a wistful, mildly depressed beauty in ''Alice by Alice,'' or, in two watercolors, in bed with a dark, handsome man named Jose, catches us by surprise. It seems at odds with Neel's early and commanding control of the art of portraiture."
1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Richard Andrade, who raped a woman and stabbed her to death, was executed today after the Supreme Court rejected his hand-printed appeal. Mr. Andrade, who was 25 years old, was pronounced dead at 12:32 A.M., nine minutes after he was injected with poison for the murder of Cordelia Mae Guevara, who was killed in 1984, when she was 28. The warden, Jack Pursley, had asked Mr. Andrade if he would like to make a final statement. The prisoner, strapped down, shook his head and stared at the ceiling, waiting for the needle."

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, GAF also said it had exercised an option to buy more than 4 million Borg-Warner shares for $39.87 a share, and it had bought an additional 200,000 shares at $38.47. GAF, a chemical concern based in Wayne, N.J., was Borg-Warner's largest shareholder until Wednesday, when the Minneapolis-based investor Irwin L.

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Top Israeli officials are convincing when they say they responded to American inquiries and thought they were just doing the U.S. a favor by getting involved in the American-Iranian arms deal. But the claim to have had solid information about the situation in Iran, how the power struggle there might be influenced and who might represent the so-called moderates is not convincing. Two Israelis, the former military attache Yaacov Nimrodi and Uri Lubrani, the Defense Ministry consultant on Shiite affairs and an architect of Israeli deals with Lebanese factions, spent many years in Iran. They were able to keep up some contacts after the Khomeini revolution. But that doesn't validate claims about openings for Western influence. The Israelis have been selling arms to Iran all along, on their own account, in secret arrangements that benefited both sides and did not imply any political trust."

''It's tough even finding the words to describe how this affects me,'' said the starting goalie, Billy Smith, who was ushered to the bench after absorbing a six-goal shelling. ''I wanted to go in there and stop the onslaught,'' said Kelly Hrudey, who watched the final trio of Flyer goals zoom into the net behind him, completing a 9-4 rout of the Islanders. ''Killer-instinct is exactly what that team runs on. They're always at your throat, especially if they think they can get away with it.''"

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"When Representative Henry B. Gonzalez struck a constituent at a local restaurant earlier this month, because the constituent called him a Communist, he did more than create a furor in the city's newspapers, which hew to old-style tabloid journalism. He also joined a storied group that includes heroes and scoundrels, from border bandits and drug runners to John F. Kennedy, immortalized in a centuries-old musical style that still flourishes in Hispanic South Texas. The form is the corrido, a narrative ballad with roots dating from at least 16th-century Spain. The corrido no longer serves the informational function it did when it was as topical as the town crier. But it lives to the extent it is almost impossible for a major event to touch the Hispanic community here without someone's penning a ballad."

Then with six seconds remaining last night, a 16-foot jump shot by Leon Wood helped the Nets relinquish that honor. For Wood's basket, with Rory Sparrow guarding him, enabled the Nets to edge the Knicks, 94-93, at Madison Square Garden. The victory brought the Nets' record to 5-19. The Knicks, who lost their seventh game in a row, dropped to 5-20 and into last place in the Atlantic Division, replacing the Nets."

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"THE Christmas party is always memorable for first-year students in the Barclay Classes. ''This is their first experience with refreshments,'' said Lois Thomson, the co-director. The fourth-grade girls, who had just finished a cha-cha, removed their white gloves and waited for the boys to bring them a Coke and two cookies. Stephanie Duris, 9 years old, kept adjusting her pink bow headband. On this special day, her mother picked her up after school -Stephanie usually walks home - so there was time to change into a party dress. ''I did my nails last night,'' Stephanie explained, but before she could say more, a voice said, ''Girls pick a partner to your left.'' The two-piece orchestra began to play, Stephanie finished her cookie, put back on her white gloves, excused herself and made her way to the dance floor, for it was ''Fascination.''"

Steve Colter capped the run with two free throws. Chicago pulled steadily away after that. (UPI) Bucks 104, Hawks 95: Jack Sikma scored 11 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter and made a 3-point play that gave Milwaukee the lead as the Bucks won their third straight, beating the Hawks in Milwaukee. The victory moved the second-place Bucks a game and a half behind the Hawks in the Central Division. Terry Cummings led Milwaukee with 32 points. Atlanta got 22 points from Glenn Rivers. Atlanta scored the first 5 points of the fourth quarter, cutting Milwaukee's lead to 75-72. The Bucks rebuilt their edge to 7 points, but the Hawks got even at 95-95 with 1:32 remaining on Wayne Rollins's jump shot.

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Stock prices fell yesterday as write-offs by several of the biggest corporations put additional pressure on a market that was already worried about today's ''triple witching hour.'' The Dow Jones industrial average, which started to retreat late in Wednesday's session, lost another 5.49 points, to 1,912.82. The big blow came from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which announced that it would eliminate 27,400 jobs and take a $3.2 billion charge against fourth-quarter earnings.

Nor was it only publicists and propagandists who proclaimed the belief, but many of their finest spirits.

In response, Governor Cuomo immediately proposed that as a temporary step, the state draw on its general treasury for the money - $75 million the first year, $150 million in future years - to pay for the transit plan. It was not clear, however, if Republicans, who come mainly from the suburbs and upstate, would accept that proposal. They have traditionally opposed spending money from the general treasury to support New York City's transit system."

''No Mercy,'' starring Richard Gere and Kim Basinger, is a film noir about a killer, a passionate love affair and the Louisiana bayous. It is what Mr. Pearce calls a ''Saturday-night movie - where people go out and have a couple of beers and enjoy themselves.'' What made him take it on? ''I had never made a film like this before,'' he said. ''And as a director you want to be a moving target, not to allow yourself to get too typecast. This is a kind of high-velocity storytelling. If I hadn't done this kind of film pretty soon, I would be suspicious that I was afraid to do it.''"

''I had never made a film like this before,'' he said. ''And as a director you want to be a moving target, not to allow yourself to get too typecast. This is a kind of high-velocity storytelling. If I hadn't done this kind of film pretty soon, I would be suspicious that I was afraid to do it.''"

Since before their season began, the Slammers, who play in the Continental Basketball Association, have been trying to telephone John (Moose) Campbell, a 6-foot-10-inch former Clemson star who ably manned the pivot for them the last two years. Once, Campbell called back and informed a publicity man that he was now a contented construction worker back in Blenheim, S.C. But his phone has since been disconnected, and neither General Manager Denny Petro nor Coach Herb Brown has spoken with the popular big guy."

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The equity investors in Ivan F. Boesky's arbitrage fund appear likely to lose as much as a third of their investment, and perhaps more, according to figures provided to the investors. At the same time, however, newly uncovered details show that Mr. Boesky received more favorable terms in his settlement of insider trading charges than had been known previously. The terms of Mr. Boesky's $100 million settlement, sources with knowledge of Mr. Boesky's company said, allowed him to collect millions of dollars in fees and possibly helped him to avoid substantial penalty payments. In another development, Guinness P.L.C., the British distiller that is the subject of a stock trading investigation in London that is said to involve Mr. Boesky, announced yesterday that it had made an equity investment of $:69.8 million, or about $100 million, in Mr. Boesky's investment partnership, Ivan F. Boesky & Company L.P. Meanwhile, the FMC Corporation said yesterday that it had filed a lawsuit against Mr. Boesky, his company and other individuals implicated in the scandal, charging insider trading relating to FMC's $2 billion recapitalization this year. The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, seeks damages in excess of $260 million. The S.E.C.'s charges against Mr. Boesky contended that he had been tipped off about the FMC deal through an information network that included Dennis B. Levine and other investment bankers."

1986-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Should Donald Regan be dismissed as White House chief of staff? Yes - not because he knew too much but because he says he knew too little; not because his departure would end the Iran-Nicaragua scandal but because he has become a symbol of White House ineptitude and/or arrogance in overriding the law and common sense. One charge alone would justify returning Mr. Regan to Wall Street: He sent the President inadequately briefed and psychologically unprepared to his disastrous news conference on Nov. 19. Mr. Reagan seemed stunned by the detail and lack of deference in the questions put to him; an alert staff chief should have seen what was coming and prepared his boss - perhaps have stopped Mr. Reagan from facing reporters at that point, since in six years of relatively polite news conferences the President had never appeared to best advantage. Mr. Regan at least should have advised the President not to insist that no other nation was involved in the arms shipments, since Mr. Regan himself had told reporters that Israel was part of the scheme. As it was, the White House quickly had to back down on the President's word."

Mr. Hasenfus, who parachuted from a C-123K cargo plane that was shot down while carrying weapons to the rebels on Oct. 5, was pardoned by the Nicaraguan National Assembly on Wednesday at the request of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra. Earlier this month, he had begun serving a 30-year sentence, the stiffest possible under Nicaraguan law. The downing of the cargo plane led to the discovery of an extensive supply operation that was based in El Salvador and may have been financed by the profits from the United States' sale of arms to Iran."

Working with the machine, in a broad parody of transactional analysis and Scientology, Elliot is able to test and reprogram his own responses to different anxiety-producing situations. He teaches himself how to rebuff a religious proseletyzer, deal with his jealousy of a friend who has suddenly achieved success as a writer and rationalize away his He also gets to see himself die in various ways, from choking in a restaurant to drowning to being hit by a car."

Despite the far higher cost of growing rice in Japan and the $1.5 billion that this country spends to subsidize its rice farmers and to reduce the high price to consumers, Japan bars virtually all rice imports, except for small amounts used to make sake or rice crackers, or rice to be distributed as food aid to other countries. Rice remains a staple of the Japanese diet. But it is a sign of the difficulties Japan faces from the high yen and its expanding trade surplus that this once-inviolable policy has come under fire in recent months."

Mr. Hasenfus, who was serving a 30-year prison sentence after his plane carrying guns to rebels was shot down over Nicaragua on Oct. 5, was pardoned Wednesday by President Daniel Ortega Saavedra and flew out of Nicaragua the same day. ''For some sectors of the Nicaraguan public, the first reaction has justifiably been to say that Hasenfus deserved to spend 30 years in jail,'' Barricada said. ''Also justifiably, they say that this could be a negative precedent if more mercenaries fall into the people's hands as the war escalates.

1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"The Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent in November, continuing the mild pickup in inflation that has accompanied firmer oil prices, the Labor Department reported today. The latest figures, which were in line with expectations, showed that if the price index rises by the same amount again this month, the 1986 inflation rate would be 1.2 percent, the smallest December-to-December increase since 1962. Economists said they regarded the November reading as further reassurance that there would little upward pressure on prices in the foreseeable future. 'Low-Inflation Environment' ''I think what it shows is a continued low-inflation environment,'' said Brian S. Wesbury, an economist at Chicago's Harris Trust and Savings Bank. Norman Robertson of the Mellon Bank added, ''We shall continue to hold inflation at bay.''"

1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"As another National Football League regular season closes with games last night through Monday, it's only right that certain people be acknowledged for their contributions, some of which have added to (or subtracted from) the general enjoyment of the last four months. In any case, the following awards are officially unofficial and are presented in the holiday spirit of good fun and good cheer: Player of the Year: Doug Flutie of the Chicago Bears. Never before has so much attention been received for so little achieved. Executive of the Year: Ladd Herzeg, the general manager of the Houston Oilers. He traded to the Rams Jim Everett, who figures to be their quarterback for the next 10 or 12 years. Everett fits in nicely with Eric Dickerson, whom the Rams drafted three years ago with a pick Herzeg traded them."

1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"The second program presented by Dennis Wayne's Dancers on Tuesday at the Triplex Theater at Manhattan Community College is just the thing for those who like their dance pretty and their dancers personable and beautifully trained. The evening gets off to a friendly start with the dancers introducing themselves, as they do at each program, and so one has the sense of watching friends throughout the evening. William Soleau, the company's resident choreographer, contributed three of the program's five dances. In ''Isle,'' performed to music by Henry Purcell, Mr. Soleau offered a well-crafted romantic duet full of muted feeling. Vivien Cockburn was compellingly clear, light and focused and Mr. Soleau moved with quiet power through the foldings, unfoldings and shared journey of this elegiac work."

Walsh has spent 50 years weaving the threads of public service and private representation into a career that has included frequent troubleshooting missions, occasional controversy, moments in the spotlight, experience as a prosecutor, judge and advocate and service at the highest levels of the profession. Today he said that the job of independent counsel was ''probably the most important that I've been asked to do.'' Then he added: ''And so I wanted to do it.'' Thirteen years ago Mr. Walsh was on the list of potential special prosecutors to head the Watergate investigation. For decades, his name has been on nearly any list of lawyers required for various blue-ribbon assignments. Over the years, one of his former law partners said today that ''private clients have turned to him when they were in trouble and public officials have turned to him when government was in trouble.''"
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Amid the spate of proposals that Ronald Reagan be restored to respectability by the counseling of ''wise men,'' the question arises, ''Are there no wise women in our nation who might have some sound advice to offer?'' We can hear the groans. Does there have to be a ''woman's angle'' to everything, including the Iranian-Nicaraguan mess? Yes, more than ever. Please note that as in Watergate no women are involved in the latest Government scandal. One can argue whether in today's scandal this is due to superior morality or to the inferior, virtually nonexistent role they play in making foreign policy. But having had no part in the conspiracy, women outsiders could bring more objectivity to the situation than the usual crew of ''wise men,'' themselves entangled in the secret webbing of the establishment's corporate-military-Government network."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"A Soviet official said today that ''several hundred'' students had been involved in the anti-Russian rioting that broke out Wednesday night in Alma-Ata, the capital of the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan.

The official press agency Tass reported tonight that Mikhail S. Solomentsev, a member of the ruling Politburo and chairman of the Communist Party committee responsible for party discipline, was visiting Alma-Ata."

Mr. Bush did not explicitly ask Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North to stop invoking their Fifth Amendment protections. But he said both men, former officials of the National Security Council staff, should ''make a great sacrifice'' by answering the questions of panels investigating the controversy. ''The country cannot wait any longer,'' he said."

The Yankees, as had been expected for more than a month, sent the unhappy catcher to the Angels for Ron Romanick, a pitcher, and a minor league player to be named. The Yankees did not say if they included money in the deal to defray Wynegar's $700,000-a-year salary for each of the next two years."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Finally, after almost seven punishing years of internal exile, Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet Union's most prominent dissident, will soon be back in Moscow. Perhaps the Russians have found some new way of balancing their fear of criticism at home against their wish to be liked abroad. Perhaps they simply found the cost of muzzling someone of Mr. Sakharov's stature to be too high. Whatever the reason, the result is welcome news. He may not be wholly free but at least he's going back home, with his wife, Yelena Bonner, whom the Russians have pardoned. The couple's return warms this holiday season."

1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"When the San Francisco Opera canceled its 1987 summer season recently, many people here viewed the decision as another sign that this city had passed its prime. According to leaders of the local arts community, so many of San Francico's largest and oldest employers have left town or run into economic storms recently that corporate contributions to the arts have plummeted. Because of that, the leaders say they are being forced to trim the city's menu of cultural programs. Michael Gehret, director of development for the San Francisco Symphony, which canceled a tour of the Soviet Union after local corporations showed little interest in subsidizing it, said, ''If the business strength of San Francisco continues to weaken, we'll lose not only dollars, but also business leadership on our boards and as volunteer fund-raisers.''"

Standing in the anatomical supply company's basement laboratory beneath Columbus Avenue this week, Henry Galiano, the 35-year-old owner of Maxilla and Mandible, rummaged through the freezer, lifting out frozen tuna tails, iguanas, lizards, squirrel monkeys, squirrels, and the heads of bobcats, flounders, gray foxes and raccoons. ''We scrounge everywhere,'' he said, finding the mouse and lifting it up to the light for a look. ''I used to pick up road kills. The highways of the United States are great places to collect natural history. This is an opportunistic business.''"

Elaborately decorated battledores are on sale near the Asakusa Kannon Temple in Tokyo. And posters have gone up everywhere announcing that the latest Tora-san film is about to open. Tora-san is a fumbling, Chaplinesque vagabond, a bit short on brains but limousine-long on heart, a comforting echo of a once simpler life. Actually, he is not so much a movie character as a Japanese institution."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Oh, to have been a fly on the wall at the meeting where it was decided that the rumors of King Kong's death had been greatly exaggerated. Someone must have noted that Kong certainly seemed dead, having fallen off the World Trade Center and been pumped full of buckshot. But that wouldn't have killed Bobby Ewing, and it didn't kill Kong either. In ''King Kong Lives,'' which opened yesterday at the Criterion and other theaters, it develops that Kong has spent the last 10 years in a coma, waiting to become the recipient of an artificial heart."

Obviously, the best method of graffiti prevention would be good, secure garages or storage facilities. Unfortunately, many communities do not welcome the construction of a Sanitation Department garage, even when it provides the vital cleaning, collection and snow-removal service they are so anxious to receive. One negative result of having to park trucks on the street is graffiti."

The Mayor and Housing Commissioner Paul A. Crotty, who appeared together at a City Hall news conference, said they would ask the State Legislature to pass enabling legislation in its session to begin next month. The city needs state authority to require that landlords set up such an escrow fund."

In what the M.T.A. chairman, Robert R. Kiley, said was ''an insurance policy'' against continued inaction in Albany, the agency's board voted to begin a process that could raise subway and bus fares from $1 to as much as $1.35 on Jan. 27 and increase commuter rail fares as much as 48 percent by March 1. The base tolls at major crossings operated by the subsidiary Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority would rise 25 cents under the plan by Jan. 27. ''What we do, we can undo,'' Mr. Kiley said. He added that he thought a compromise might be worked out in Albany in time to avert the higher fares."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"It may not be unprecedented for both husband and wife to have books on the best-seller list simultaneously, but tomorrow a couple who live in Berwyn, Pa., will find themselves in that enviable position. They are Julie Nixon Eisenhower, the daughter of the 37th President, and David Eisenhower, the grandson of the 34th President. Her biography of her mother, ''Pat Nixon: The Untold Story'' (Simon & Schuster), has been a best seller for four weeks and tomorrow will be No. 9 on The New York Times nonfiction list. Mr. Eisenhower's biography of his grandfather, ''Eisenhower at War: 1943-1945'' (Random House), will be No. 15 on the same list. Mr. Eisenhower's book - the first of three volumes - was on the list briefly in October. Its return may have been helped by the author's appearances with his wife (whose book was published two months after his) on the Phil Donohue show and at several book signings. Among these was one at Macy's in Manhattan and another at the Lyndon B. Johnson Library in Austin, Tex., to which they were invited by Lady Bird Johnson."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"In a reversal of policy, the Defense Department is asserting its right to play a major role in a proposed space station because of a potential need to use it for ''Star Wars'' research, Government officials said yesterday. The decision threatened to jeopardize delicate negotiations to arrange broad international cooperation in the project. Western Europe, Japan and Canada have agreed in principle to provide financial support for the $8 billion station, but the Pentagon has now asked the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to postpone further talks with foreign participants that had been scheduled in mid-January. The Defense Department's action marked a further assertion of military influence over the civilian space program, especially since the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. Pentagon officials said a new ''defense space policy,'' expected soon, would encourage greater emphasis on manned military space operations, in part to conduct experiments for the space-based missile defense program, formally the Strategic Defense Initiative."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"There were no parades or confetti throwers today for Eugene Hasenfus, the American cargo handler pardoned by Nicaragua for smuggling arms to the rebels there. There were a couple of ''Welcome Home'' signs on storefront marquees. It was a quiet return of the native to this northern Wisconsin town of 12,000 people, where residents are divided over the propriety of Mr. Hasenfus's actions to aid the Nicaraguan counterrevolutionaries. ''We're not talking about an American war hero,'' said Mayor Harold A. Pierce. ''We're talking about a guy who was lucky.''"
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"The Beneficial Corporation, one of the nation's largest consumer lenders, said yesterday that it had rejected a $1.74 billion takeover bid from ''a major U.S. corporation'' as inadequate and decided instead to sell some $1.4 billion of its operations to trim debts. The company also suggested that job cutbacks of its 6,000 employees were also a possibility. Wall Street reacted gloomily to the announcement, with Beneficial's stock sliding $3, a share, to $56, in heavy trading. Last August, when Beneficial announced that the Alleghany Corporation was accumulating shares, the stock jumped $28.50 in one day, to $73. The stock has weakened substantially since then, and Alleghany and others are thought to have lost interest in a takeover."

1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Shortly after World War II a friend brought a young student to the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Igor Tamm, proposing the young man for independent study. Professor Tamm interviewed the young student, Andrei D. Sakharov, at length, but finally decided not to take him. Later the professor confided to a friend what he had advised the student: ''You know, young man, it's hardly likely that you will make a real physicist. You have a sort of humanistic cast of mind.''"
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"The New York State Racing and Wagering Board has fined the New York Racing Association's clerk of scales, Charles Sullivan, $500 for an error that resulted in several apprentice jockeys at Aqueduct riding with a two-pound weight allowance to which they were not entitled. The riders involved will suffer no penalty. The clerk, who has been in that job since April 1, 1981, misapplied a rule that an apprentice is allowed a 10-pound weight allowance until he has ridden five career winners, and only a 7-pound allowance until he has ridden an additional 30 winners. After that, his allowance drops to five pounds. Jockeys lose their apprenticeships a year after their 35th winner."

1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Personnel and institutional changes in the National Park Service ordered by the Interior Department could change the character of the parks over time, Park Service officials asserted today. But Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel defended the changes. Senior Park Service officials here and around the country contended that the changes had been imposed to wrest control over park policy from the service's professional staff and place it in the hands of political appointees. But Secretary Hodel responded that the charge that the Reagan Administration was trying to strengthen political control over the service ''will not stand up to scrutiny.'' He said in an interview that the job changes would send ''a new burst of adrenalin'' through the service."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"New York State officials, saying the New York City suburbs were experiencing a housing shortage of crisis proportions, proposed government incentives yesterday to encourage construction in Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland Counties. In a report to Governor Cuomo, the State Housing Director, William B.

1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"The Court of Appeals ruled today that it was unconstitutional for state-regulated utilities to contribute ratepayer money to charity, saying the practice forces customers to subsidize causes they may oppose. The state's highest court, in a 5-to-2 decision, held that the practice, which is widespread, violates the right of free expression. ''Coercion results from the fact that the state establishes the rate that the customer must pay, and the rate includes an allowance for the objected-to contributions,'' the majority opinion said. ''Because the utility is a monopoly, the customer must pay or be deprived of his right to utility service.''"
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Yesterday's ''triple witching hour'' was a unique event in a number of respects, traders and market analysts said. Not only did more shares trade hands at the close than ever before -over 85 million - but the stock market handled the huge order flow ''without a glitch,'' according to Richard Torrenzano, a New York Stock Exchange spokesman. Of more interest to professionals were the tactics employed at the close, a time when stock index futures, stock index options and individual stock options all expire. Generally, on triple expiration Fridays, most of the attention is focused on the relationship between the expiring futures contracts and the underlying stocks. But yesterday, most of the action, and the reason stock prices rose at the close, was due to the relationship between the price of the March Standard & Poor's 500 futures contract and the underlying stocks."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"After days of proposals and counterproposals, Governor Cuomo and key legislators ended the week with no agreement today on a plan to finance a rebuilding of New York City's mass-transit system and freeze its fares. The special session of the Legislature recessed and will resume Monday. The decision to recess came shortly before 3 P.M. as negotiations, already complex, grew even more confused when Senate Republicans agreed to reconsider a Democratic proposal that they had rejected less than 24 hours before. ''We're going around in circles,'' Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink, a Brooklyn Democrat, said as he left an hourlong meeting with Mr. Cuomo and Warren M. Anderson, a Binghamton Republican who is the Senate majority leader."

On Wednesday, Jose Torres, chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, said that postfight tests of Witherspoon's urine specimens had revealed traces of marijuana in the fighter's system. At the time Torres said that Witherspoon would be suspended.

1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Every Thursday morning, the waiting room in Suite L at New York University Medical Center is crowded with balding men. Once in the doctor's office, they offer their bald spots for measurement and then collect a month's supply of a clear, astringent liquid. That liquid, Rogaine, may offer a touch of bottled youth. It contains minoxidil, the first drug to offer some hope of overcoming a receding hairline. Twice a day, every day, the patients in the New York University study squeeze the solution on their scalps. ''It's a pain,'' said Matti Leshem, a 23-year-old actor. ''I'm lucky,'' said a 27-year-old lawyer. Minoxidil was originally developed by the Upjohn Company as an oral drug to treat hypertension. When patients on the medication started sprouting hair on various parts of their bodies, Upjohn researchers decided to turn the drug's side effect into an asset. They dissolved minoxidil in a lotion and began testing it as an elixir for those suffering from the most common form of hair loss, male-pattern baldness. Since clinical tests began, some patients have grown hair where they had become bald. Even more have thickened wispy strands, and for all the progress of hair loss has stopped. It takes from three to six months for any changes to occur."

1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"An amazing thing has happened to the muddy trickle of a river that separates the United States from Mexico here. For a change, the Rio Grande is living up to its name. Instead of the usual sorry stream along the border with Mexico, it has become a Big River, and in the process it seems to be succeeding in slowing illegal immigration where generations of law enforcers have failed. It has also created a treacherous situation that has led to the drownings of dozens of aliens unprepared for the river's new potency and has led to fears of flooding on the Mexican side of the river."

''Mama, it's O.K.,'' the patient, Rimma Bravve, the 32-year-old emigre from Moscow, said as she brushed back tears and embraced her sobbing mother, Khanna Anbinder, 65 years old, a retired Rochester pediatrician who left the Soviet Union in 1980 after the death of her husband. ''It is the happiest day of my life,'' Mrs. Bravve said at a crowded afternoon news conference later at Kennedy International Airport.

1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Along with Channel 13's ''Channel Crossings,'' Channel 31's ''Window on World Television'' has been taking advantage of what is supposed to be a ''global village'' by acquiring outstanding television productions from around the world, not just from English-speaking sources. More often than not, the policy has paid off handsomely. The latest example of clever purchasing is a new production of ''Lysistrata'' by Aristophanes, which Channel 31 will broadcast tomorrow night at 10."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"No political crisis is complete these days without its footnotes in the form of lapel button, and the Iran-Nicaragua contretemps is no exception. The Young Republicans came up with ''North, American Hero,'' selling for $2 to aid Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North's defense fund, and now the Youth for Democratic Action is selling, for $1, a button that reads, ''Did Reagan know, or was he napping?'' The group says an informal survey attendant to the sale of the button has so far logged 32 respondents favoring napping as against 15 believing the President knew. One repondent, naturally, took the Fifth."

The committee held another meeting this week and many financial analysts believe the central bank decided again to hold monetary policy steady.

Hijazi's article on the Shiite-Palestinian battle in Lebanon (front page, Dec. 5) confirms what we've been hearing in urgent communications from partner agencies in that country: civilian casualties are skyrocketing, while emergency assistance isn't getting through, and the essential work of nonsectarian aid agencies is being severely disrupted. We recently received an urgent telex from Secours Populaire Libanais appealing for help to secure the release of a civilian doctor kidnapped by militiamen in south Lebanon. This week we got a letter from the Amel Association describing the impact of a car bomb on its head office and staff in Beirut."

''This was all plotted out,'' said the official, who did not want to identified. He said the youth, Wyley Gates of Canaan, had been playing a game -possibly on a computer - that he had given the code name ''Infierno,'' a reference to Dante's ''Inferno.'' He said several other high school students were also involved in the game, which they had been playing for more than a month."

Americans may be drinking fewer alcoholic beverages, but they are certainly eating more of them than ever before. Wittingly or un. It's not likely that the three-martini lunch of yesteryear will be replaced by topping off two slices of Irish whisky cake with four liqueur-laced bonbons, but such spirited foods often come as a surprise, even a shock, to the unsuspecting."

1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Living up to its name, the ''triple witching hour'' cast a bizarre spell over Wall Street yesterday as stock prices seemingly beat the odds by rising in the final minutes of the most hectic session in history. Not only was it Wall Street's busiest day, but the number of orders that piled up for execution at the closing bell produced the most frantic minute ever for the New York Stock Exchange, one in which more than 85 million shares traded. In all, almost 244.7 million shares traded on the Big Board, topping the previous record of 240.5 million, set Sept. 12. Despite the record activity, Wall Street seemed to handle the witching hour in stride, without the wrenching price movements of the past.

Steel City is now a city of glass. Once a symbol of the industrial region sometimes referred to as the Rust Belt, it is now a renowned health and educational center with a wealth of cultural attractions. When it comes time to pay taxes, however, health, education and culture are steel's miserly stepchildren."

''Few people are having an excellent season so far,'' one top merchant said, ''so it looks like another cliffhanger.'' The retailer, head of one of the nation's best-known department stores and who asked not to be identified, said: ''More affluent people are buying well and our luxury goods are moving.

1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Out of Leighton's doors on Broadway walked some of the slickest customers in Times Square - pugilists, promoters, swells and sharps, high-rollers who lived at the edge of fashion and the law. Tonight, after 67 years, those doors will close for the last time. In what has become the end-of-an-era era around the theater district, Leighton's departure stands out every bit as much as the alligator, ostrich, lizard and eel skin shoes that once filled its windows. There are not many places that offer both Oxxford suits and leather ones. Leighton's was such a store. Three generations of the Schlesinger family saw the business through flush times and watched it weather the worst. They had hoped to profit from the very building boom that ultimately doomed their 47th Street location."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"A ruptured main that dumped 5 million gallons of water into the Longwood Avenue subway station in the South Bronx, leaving its mark two feet high on the token booth, sent 120,000 riders of the IRT No. 6 line scrambling during yesterday's morning and evening rush hours, transit officials said. ''If Murphy stays away from this corner,'' the Transit Authority's superintendent of track construction, Mike Hardiman, said - referring to the proverbial prognosticator of foul-ups -''we should have all the water out by midnight and service should be restored in the morning.'' The flood forced passengers traveling between the Bronx and Manhattan on what is customarily called the Lexington Avenue line to seek alternate transportation - at least until 30 buses began a shuttle service between the Hunts Point Avenue station in the Bronx and the 125th Street stop in Harlem."

''We determined that the building was in imminent peril from a fire safety standpoint,'' said John McCormack, the Deputy Chief of the Fire Department's Division One, who said the department had posted a vacate order on December 10 and obtained a court order on Thursday to remove people from the premises.

Among the classiest duds to be seen are on view in the Museum's Costume Institute, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a big garment exhibition organized by Diana Vreeland, the arbiter of style who serves as special consultant to the costume institute. This is a show - one flight down from the main floor, but by no means a bargain basement - of 150 ballroom gowns, evening dresses and other such garments and accessories that have been worn to dances on outstanding social occasions tailored for fun. Each item was once dernier cri, whether in the 18th or 19th century at stiff court formals or in the 1960's, when one twisted in short dresses. There are flamenco designs and billowing fashions, all in attractive settings enveloped in the scent of perfume. If you weary of looking at dresses, you can refresh yourself by looking at pictures of dresses and the people in them drawn from the museum's collection."

But if he has written a finer, more moving work this listener has yet to hear it. When it was performed as the second and final offering in the New York Philomusica concert at Merkin Concert Hall on Wednesday night, its mystical effect seemed as strong as ever, and the work is 45 years old."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: It was ironic to see the appeal to Lord Curzon, the very symbol of British Orientalist thinking and his book ''Persia and the Persian Question'' (The Editorial Notebook: ''Mudakhil in Iran, Then and Now,'' Dec. 1) to make sense of the present fiasco, since Curzon, even in his own time, was considered by Iranian and Western democrats alike to have played a principal part in the tragic fate of the people of that country. If Curzon reported on the Iranian ''mudakhil'' bargaining system, he certainly was himself a master of that art when it came to British colonial policy in the region. Only a year after the successful 1906 Iranian Revolution, which gave the people of Iran for the first time a constitution and a parliament, the Aug. 31, 1907, Anglo-Russian Convention was signed, essentially partitioning Iran into two spheres of influence, giving both unlimited control over all political and commercial concessions of the Iranian Government."

This agreement should pave the way for a restructuring of the country's much larger debt with commercial banks that had demanded that Brazil first come to terms with foreign creditors grouped together in the ''Paris Club.'' Negotiations with the Paris Club, which will now begin Jan. 19, will cover arrears for 1985 and 1986 of $2 billion in principal and $800 million in interest. Soon after, Brazil is expected to present a proposal to banks for a multiyear rescheduling of perhaps as much as $60 billion in medium- and long-term debt."

He might have wondered, for example, why the Jets cut him a few days before last Saturday's game against the Steelers after he started all 14 games the Jets had played. He wasn't out of work long - one game. Now, he has not only been recalled to the team, he is also scheduled to start again as the outside left linebacker when the Jets end their regular season tomorrow against the Bengals in a game that could decide home-field advantage in the playoffs."

Dr. Sakharov, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights work, was exiled to Gorky without trial in January 1980 and has lived there since, often under harsh conditions. Miss Bonner, who was free to travel during the early part of his exile, was restricted to the same city in 1984 after her conviction."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"At a dusty and windy campsite on this city's outskirts, a bedraggled and stunned group of refugees from Afghanistan were struggling this week without water, food or the belongings left behind in a Karachi slum colony that had been bulldozed a few days before. ''We are poor people, just laborers,'' an old man said, showing his calloused hands. ''We have done nothing to deserve this.'' A few miles away, the same anguish was voiced by a cluster of families huddled in the courtyard of a high school, where they had fled to escape the mobs of ethnic Pathans that had set fire to their homes and shot at them with submachine guns and automatic rifles."

Asher, 49, guilty Thursday of conspiracy, mail fraud and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and perjury. The charges related to an attempt to steer a computer contract to a tiny California company. The two could be sentenced to 55 years in prison and fined a total of $65,000."

The accord, signed early this morning by all of the group's members except Iraq, calls for across-the-board reductions in output of more than 7 percent for the first half of 1986. A key question about the agreement is whether the group will maintain enough discipline to defend a fixed price.

1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Both the conductor and the soloist of the current New York Philharmonic subscription program are making their first Philharmonic appearances this week at Avery Fisher Hall. Esa-Pekka Salonen, the 28-year-old Finnish conductor, is leading a program - heard yesterday afternoon, with the final performance tonight at 8 - of Niccolo Castiglioni's ''Sinfonia con Giardino''; Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, with the 31-year-old, Moscow-born Andrei Gavrilov as soloist, and finally Nielsen's Symphony No. 4 (''The Inextinguishable''). Of the two debutants, Mr. Salonen was the more interesting, and he was most interesting in the Nielsen. This Danish composer (1865-1931) had something of a run of attention a few years ago, with Leonard Bernstein and the Philharmonic leading the way. Mr. Salonen, too, has made Nielsen - or at least this symphony, which he has recorded - a speciality."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"A former Federal judge in Manhattan, Lawrence E. Walsh, was appointed today as special prosecutor in charge of the Iran arms affair and given broad investigative powers. The three-judge panel that chose Mr. Walsh said he would have jurisdiction to investigate possible wrongdoing beyond any illegalities in the sale of military equipment to Iran and the diversion of the profits to Nicaraguan rebels. Among other things, Mr. Walsh will be permitted to study charges that the rebels, known as contras, received illegal support that was not tied to the Iran arms sales. The panel's decision to confer the broad powers went beyond the request of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d. Earlier this month, Mr. Meese asked in a court motion that the special prosecutor be given a more limited mandate, dealing specifically with Iranian weapons shipments and diversion of profits."

Morris, one of baseball's premier pitchers, then beat last night's midnight deadline and accepted the arbitration offer of the Detroit Tigers. Morris' acceptance means he will return - most reluctantly - to the Tigers for a 10th season, with his salary to be determined by an arbitrator. If Morris wins, as clubs generally expect him to, his salary will be close to $2 million."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"By choosing Lawrence Walsh, an elder statesman among American lawyers, as independent counsel to investigate the Iran-contra crisis, a Federal court in Washington helps calm the controversy while assuring more satisfactory answers to its mysteries. Mr. Walsh, a former New York lawyer, judge, Deputy Attorney General and Vietnam peace negotiator, combines worldly experience with high ethical standards. His appointment, along with this week's appointment of highly competent Senate and House select committees, betoken a return to trustworthy government and a fair accounting of where the nation's leadership went astray. These reassurances come at a price. The executive branch is in partial receivership, properly stripped of its power to investigate itself. Though some officials plead the Fifth Amendment, the Administration as a whole is pleading ignorance. That leaves Congress and Mr. Walsh to sort out policy misjudgments, flawed execution, deception and perhaps downright criminality."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Before the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded its hearings Thursday on the Iran arms deal, three dozen reporters had spent three weeks of 12-hour days outside the hearing room. Their duty there involved chasing tight-lipped witnesses through the Capitol corridors and begging senators and aides for scraps of information on the connection between the arms deal and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. Such bits of information were occasionally provided, but usually in oblique phrases that would test the skills of a cryptographer, lest the speaker stand accused of breaking his pledge to uphold the committee's rule of secrecy. The stakeout is a journalistic institution, one that takes on added importance in a major world news center like Washington."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Vice President Bush called on Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, the former national security adviser, and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, his former aide, to ''tell us the truth'' about their roles in the sale of American arms to Iran and diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. Mr. Bush, in a speech in Iowa, strongly suggested that the two men should testify regardless of whether they are offered immunity for their statements. President Reagan has declined to ask his former aides to overlook their constitutional rights and instead urged Congressional panels investigating the case to grant Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North limited immunity. Both officers invoked the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination when summoned to testify. [ Page 1. ]"

Mordechai Manuel Noah, expressing his distaste for anti-Semitism and other forms of religious intolerance, reminds us that in the same year our second President, John Adams, wrote a letter to the same officer. In his letter, Adams espoused the Zionist movement to revive the Hebrew nationality in Palestine, giving to him the distinction of being the first American President to take this position (the popular notion is that Woodrow Wilson was the first)."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"The White House said today that it would request funds to design a method for deploying large MX nuclear missiles on railroad cars and to develop a smaller nuclear missile. In an unexpected move, it said the number of missiles to be sought would depend on progress in arms negotiations with the Soviet Union. The announcement reopened a political dispute that has been going on for years over nuclear missiles and how to protect them from attack. Funds for developing the smaller 37,000-pound, single-warhead missile, informally dubbed Midgetman, and for basing the 10-warhead MX, which weighs nearly 200,000 pounds, would require Congressional approval."
1986-12-20T00:00:00Z,"The State Department spokesman said today that he had been mistaken in saying that the departing American Ambassador, Arthur A.

Redman explained that in fact the Ambassador had left the decision to President Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz. ''It would not be accurate to say it was for personal reasons, as I said yesterday,'' Mr. Redman said. ''That was a bit of a misunderstanding.''"
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"PEOPLE wise in the ways of Washington say that in publicizing reports on major domestic issues over the last six weeks, the Reagan Administration was trying to shift attention from the controversy over arms sales to Iran. Whatever their immediate uses, the reports on welfare, federalism, the status of the family and catastrophic medical insurance were conceived months before the uproar over Iran. Taken together, they reflect a serious, systematic effort to formulate domestic policy. Their curious mix of bold proposals and simple verities reflects contradictory impulses to shrink the role of Government in some areas while expanding it in others."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Now that a former chief of French intelligence has disclosed the existence of 10 tons of largely unexamined war documents from the French security police, the French Government is transferring them to the army's historical archives, which means they will be legally sealed from scrutiny for 60 years, as Judith Miller points out.

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Love it or loathe it, Minimalist music, with its patterned repetition, seemingly endless length and stubborn refusal to come to conventional climaxes, is everywhere these days. Right now, the fifth act of Robert Wilson's controversial ''CIVIL warS,'' a full-blown opera with music by Philip Glass, is in the midst of a run at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. But no matter where one turns, Minimalism is being enjoyed by eager young devotees and denounced by rival composers and unsympathetic critics. In either case, it's a subject that won't go away. At a panel discussion on the state of contemporary music at the Aspen Music Festival in 1985, it was finally decided to place a moratorium on any mention of the name Philip Glass, since it otherwise cropped at every point and on any subject as a sign of redemption or corruption. For critical observers, the current ubiquity of Minimalism offers certain ironies. The best-known Minimalist composers, Mr. Glass and Steve Reich, now reject the term as irrelevant to the music they have composed since the late 1960's. Whether one accepts that rejection - composers are notoriously nervous about labels - it still seems accurate to place Minimalist music's creative peak at least 15 years ago."

At home, we crunched through the snow at a supermarket parking lot to select our Christmas tree from among the many frozen specimens whose branches had been flattened temporarily against their sides during a cramped ride on a truck from the northern forests. The night we trimmed the tree, a week before Christmas, whipped the five of us into a frenzy.

Mr. Cuomo asked the State Public Service Commission to cut gas, electric and telephone bills by $2.15 billion over two years, a plan that could lower rates by 5 percent to 10 percent. Approval of the plan would reverse more than a decade of annual utility rate increases that were spurred by inflation and rising interest rates. Because the changes in the Federal tax code affect all utilities in the nation, consumer advocates say that consumers may begin to see decreases in their utility bills as early as January and further reductions as the new tax laws are phased in over the next two years.

''They're calling thinking they're going to get the name of some magic road to avoid the construction, and we're telling them instead of battling traffic you should be in a car pool. It has not been the most effective marketing tool.'' The confusion has occurred because of seven signs recently put up by the State Department of Transportation.

But under the newest tightening of emergency rules, blacks and other dissenters were also told what they may not refuse to do - patronize stores, accept the draft, go to school or use the buses that provide apartheid's umbilical link between white-run cities and black labor in the townships. Under regulations imposed Dec. 11, such activities, their incitement or press reporting of them became ''subversive'' - punishable by maximum fines of $9,000 and up to 10 years in jail. Resistance was outlawed, and the residual channels of peaceful protest seemed closed."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"THROUGHOUT the industrial world, women are catching up with men in education and earning power. But if some current trends continue, they may never achieve equality. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, women claim a much higher share of places in higher education than they did a decade ago. In the United States, Canada, Norway, Sweden and Denmark, the proportion of women at universities and other institutions of higher education is roughly in line with their proportion in the population, and in a few instances is higher. But many countries, including Japan, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Britain, are lagging in this regard."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"PEARL HARBOR WAS BOMBED THREE months after I started grade school, and my schoolyard was transformed into an arena of absolute good and evil. As we boys swallowed our graham crackers and milk, we vowed to fight to the death. The girls would all be nurses to tend our wounds. I resolved to become a pilot. As I daydreamed in class, the Messerschmitt came apart under the relentless pounding of my six 50-caliber wing guns. The Luftwaffe was annihilated by morning recess. I solemnly promised myself that one day I would give the thumbs-up salute, just like the youth in the recruiting poster, and then roar off to death or glory, the wind pressing the goggles against my face."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"A police official, after quitting his post, said today that only history would show whether a conspiracy forced his removal from an inquiry into purported police brutality in Northern Ireland. The official, John Stalker, 47 years old, the Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, announced his resignation Friday, seven months after he was taken off the Northern Ireland investigation and suspended pending an inquiry of purported misconduct. In August, the Police Authority cleared Mr. Stalker of accusations that he associated with criminals and used police cars for personal business, and the authority, a law-enforcement monitoring group, reinstated Mr. Stalker to the force."

We have gotten the things that the United States intended.'' ''I will recommend that the United States meet its assessed contribution,'' he said. ''We will do our darndest.''"
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"In January 1985, President Reagan told the American people there was ''a new danger'' in Nicaragua because the Sandinista Government was receiving support from ''Colonel Qaddafi's Libya, the P.L.O. and, most recently, the Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran.'' At a news conference three days later, the President said the leftwing Nicaragua Government had received ''certain types of munitions from Iran'' and suggested that the Iranian Government was coaching the Sandinistas on how to carry out terrorist acts."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"IT WAS THE FIRST DAY OF rehearsal of a new production at the Arena Stage, in Washington. It was also the first time American actors had had the chance to work with Yuri Lyubimov, the celebrated Russian avant-garde theater director now in exile from the Soviet Union. Invited by Zelda Fichandler, the Arena producing director, he was staging his adaptation of Dostoyevsky's ''Crime and Punishment,'' scheduled to open Jan. 7. Lyubimov, a silver-haired man in his late 60's, seemed as excited about his American debut as the cast. For nearly 20 years, since 1964, Lyubimov had been the artistic director of the most popular theater in Moscow, the Taganka, where he staged avant-garde productions despite harassment by cultural bureaucrats."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"There we were, shivering in the chilly Austrian night, in a narrow street next to the post office, where the pay telephones were. We had staked out the telephones when we arrived in St. Anton a few days earlier, planning our calls home to our families on Christmas Day. Our pockets were full of the unfamiliar coins we had been hoarding. We hoped we had enough to last through the few minutes it would take to say ''Merry Christmas! Yes, I wish I could be there, too.'' to each of the many members of each of our families, who, six hours behind us, would be just finishing up the morning's attack on the packages under the tree. It was 1982, my first Christmas away from home. For the last decade or so, I've been doing a pretty fair imitation of an adult. I work, pay the rent, water the plants and generally make sure the five basic food groups are represented in the refrigerator. Christmas, with its implicit and explicit celebration of family, is the one time of year that can make me feel as if something is missing in the way I live. I share my home and my life with someone but am not married and don't have children. If I don't go home for Christmas, it means I am willfully (and for no apparent reason) altering a tradition."

Shultz will meet in Washington next month with Oliver Tambo, president of the outlawed African National Congress, a top State Department official announced today. The talks between Mr. Shultz and Mr. Tambo will represent the highest level of diplomatic contact between the United States and the black guerrilla group, which opposes the white South African Government and its system of racial discrimination, known as apartheid. Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, announced the planned meeting after a two-hour lunch meeting with three A.N.C. officials, including Govan Mbeki, a member of the group's executive council."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"THEY may be enjoying their new computers, but college newspapers are not enjoying the large debts these systems forced them to incur. But many campus papers are discovering that the same computerized editing and printing systems that caused their financial woes can be the remedy. At the University of Maryland, for example, The Diamondback has established a profit-making publishing subsidiary that prints other college publications, business cards, newsletters and posters. The subsidiary produces $100,000 a year, 10 percent of the newspaper's total revenues. ''We felt we had a lot more capacity for production than our needs, so it made a lot of sense to get outside work for it,'' said Michael Fribush, The Diamondback's professional general manager."

Reached by telephone in Gorky, the city to which he has been confined since 1980 for his public criticism of Soviet policies, Mr. Sakharov said he had not promised Mikhail S. Gorbachev that he would curtail his activities in exchange for permission to come back to the Soviet capital. ''I am going to live as I lived before my exile, and resume all of my activities,'' Dr. Sakharov, a 65-year old physicist, said. He confirmed that Mr. Gorbachev had telephoned on Tuesday, one day after the authorities had unexpectedly installed a telephone in the physicist's Gorky apartment. The Soviet leader told Dr. Sakharov that he could go back to Moscow and to his work in theoretical physics."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Everyone wants to get rid of it. And that is why the noxious residue of New York City's 14 sewage-treatment plants has become the subject of a bitter dispute between the city and a group of barge operators. For more than 50 years, the city has been dumping its sludge at a site 12 miles off Sandy Hook, N.J., which has become a veritable dead sea of goo that kills marine life. Now, fearing further ecological danger that could impair public health, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency has ordered the city to dump at a new site on the edge of the Continental Shelf, 106 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean."

The Russian, Anatoly Koryagin, 48 years old, from Kharkov, has been opposing the use of psychiatry for political purposes. He was arrested, tried and convicted in 1981 for saying that a dissident sent to a psychiatric prison was sane."

Snuggled with his piano into a corner of Devereux, a restaurant in the Essex House, Central Park South near Seventh Avenue, Mr. Bright quietly weaves echoes of Erroll Garner's joyfully positive rhythms, Art Tatum's airy touch and rolling lines and suggestions of Nat King Cole and Teddy Wilson into a repertory of familiar, standard pop tunes."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"INFLUENZA has reached epidemic proportions in Connecticut, state health officials say, and it is likely many of the people jamming shopping malls have been spreading more than holiday cheer. The first reports of the flu, identified as Influenza A, type Taiwan, came from several college campuses, but by last week it had spread to high schools, elementary schools and throughout the general population, health officials said. ''It struck Connecticut with a vengeance,'' said Dr. Morris Ostroff, chief of emergency medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in Hartford. ''We've been seeing 20 to 30 cases a day.''"
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"COMMUNITY control of New York City's public schools comes and goes. A generation ago, after an extraordinarily bitter teachers' strike, came the elected community school boards, which share responsibility with the central Board of Education; now the president of the board, Robert F. Wagner Jr., contends that the system ''in some ways has led to the worst of all worlds.'' Chief among Mr. Wagner's complaints, voiced in an interview, is the influence of politics and patronage in the 32 local boards. The result, he said, is ''more deadening than anything the central bureaucracy has done to the schools.''"

Within the last two years more than a dozen new restaurants have opened there, several to well-earned accolades. Just a few months ago another newcomer, Il Falco, arrived. Occupying two floors of an office building diagonally across from Bloomingdale's, Il Falco is a study in restraint: dubonnet carpets and matching napkins, white tablecloths and hanging plants and pale pink walls with several art posters provide an understated backdrop for some of the best Italian cooking in town."

Brian Hayward turned back 27 shots to help Montreal avenge a loss to the Devils by the same score in New Jersey last Sunday. Montreal started the third period with a 3-0 lead but failed to protect Brian Hayward's shutout bid as Claude Loiselle scored for New Jersey at 6 minutes 15 seconds.
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Two years ago, when the state chose this town on Maryland's Eastern Shore as the site for a new $80 million prison, a storm of protest arose. Residents here in Somerset County, which is considered the state's poorest county, said they feared escaping prisoners, swelling welfare roles as the families of prisoners moved close to the prison, and damage to the area's image as a quiet place to live. A rallying cry of protesters was ''Build it in Baltimore, that's where most of the customers are.''"

Nonetheless, he counts as a New Jersey artist, having made Coytesville in Bergen County his base from 1907 on, and it is at the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers that the legacy of work left by him came to rest three years ago. Bequeathed by the artist's niece, Jeane Overbury Hart, the collection numbers about 5,000 items, of which the sampling that will remain on view here through Feb. 3 is but a small fraction. Still, at 140 watercolors, prints, drawings and paintings, it is the largest Hart survey since the Newark Museum's memorial retrospective of 1935."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"The Giants ended their regular season today with a victory, which was hardly different because they now have won their last nine games. But this one was different because the score and the winning streak and the season record all found their way into the record book. It was also different because the Giants are two victories away from Super Bowl XXI Jan. 25 in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. Today, they routed the Green Bay Packers, 55-24, their highest score of the season. It was their 14th victory of the season, the most ever in the Giants' 62-year history.

There are more than 150,000 of them, and scores more are being set up every day, according to Government officials and corporate lawyers. The companies usually consist of no more than a few typed pages in a manila folder, but they enable their foreign owners to do business anywhere in the world anonymously and tax-free. In the last week, three Panamanian companies have been linked to the United States' sale of weapons to Iran and the diversion of profits to the supply network of the Nicaraguan rebels or contras. Other Panamanian companies may also be involved."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Some dance works are like articles in an intellectual quarterly. They are interesting when you have them in front of your eyes, but ultimately they are disposable. They are not the equivalent of a classic book, one that you can return to repeatedly. These thoughts came to mind during the recent performances by the company of Bill T. Jones and Arnie Zane and the one headed by David Gordon in the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival. At this point, one might digressively note that ballet and its traditions seemed to be surprisingly strong reference points in both programs. Mr. Jones and Mr. Zane included quotations from George Balanchine's ''Serenade'' in their evening. Mr. Gordon's allusion to Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Patineurs'' was overt in ''The Seasons,'' a work he might not have created if Jerome Robbins had not revived the seasons theme with his Verdi ballet, ''The Four Seasons,'' several years ago. It is obviously unfair to compare Mr. Gordon, Mr. Jones and Mr. Zane to some of the greatest choreographers of all time. But is it disconcerting to suggest that the works on these programs might not endure as long as ''Serenade,'' composed in 1934, and ''Les Patineurs,'' created in 1937? Balanchine was younger than any of these choreographers when he created ''Serenade'' and Ashton was close to them in age when he choreographed ''Les Patineurs.''"
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"THE baseball season ended two months ago, but nobody can prove it. The headlines this past pre-Christmas week dealt, like the game itself, with the physical (Gooden's encounter with Tampa's finest), the cerebral (Morris's salary negotiations), and juridical (a verdict for the Shea Stadium parachutist). And when they said Morris they meant not football Joe of the Giants but baseball Jack, the once and future king of the Detroits. Granted their intrinsic news value, those and other stories have seemed to reflect somehow an added glow - a glow not so much from any seasonable hearth as from what by general consent had to be the most extraordinary sequence of playoff and World Series games baseball has ever known."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"MANY students, parents and teachers have for years criticized standardized college admission examinations, such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test, as superficial and unfair. By attaching a number to such an elusive quality as college preparedness, the critics say, the College Board tests create an illusion of objectivity. Now another educational yardstick is under attack. Recently, a growing number of affluent communities like Great Neck have joined elite private schools that have stopped ranking students according to grade point average. Although the Great Neck Board of Education delayed formal action, officials predicted that by next fall students would no longer be ranked at one of the area's two secondary schools, North High School. A decision on South High School is expected later. As the case in Great Neck illustrates, the dispute over rankings has arisen in highly competitive suburban districts where most students plan to go to college. In such schools, the opponents of ranking say, many students earn grades above 90 percent. Slight differences, often less than one-hundredth of a point, can determine whether a student places in the top or bottom half of a class."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"If New York ran on logic, the combination of an overbuilt midtown Manhattan, a rising vacancy rate in office space, and slightly more restrictive zoning would put an end, at least for the time being, to the mega-projects that have so crowded the city's skyline. After all, why build a huge skyscraper when so many factors argue against it? How naive such reasoning is, however, is proved by the latest proposal for an immense tower in midtown -a building project that is more brazen, surely, than any proposed in the last generation. It is First Boston Corporation's plan to erect a 74-story tower on the east side of Madison Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets, a building that would be more than twice the size of what the city's zoning laws normally allow on that site. If built, the tower would be the fourth tallest building in Manhattan, and it would be squeezed onto a small block on a narrow street in what is already one of the most densely built-up sections of New York City."

He is wrapping 50-yard lengths of vinyl-coated fencing around the foundation plantings of his house and spraying the outlying shrubbery with some black, tarlike repellent. When he is through, his tidy house and yard begin to resemble a redoubt during wartime, fortified against the enemy. Ted has one of those enviable suburban yards. Lush varieties of shrubs bloom in succession throughout the warmer months. His lawn, initially rolled down as sod from a flatbed truck the way carpeting is installed, is as green as a valley in Ireland. He cares about lawns. Retired now, he also enjoys the labor of keeping his space verdant."

Beset by slumping sales and determined not to return to the generous incentives that led to a whopping third-quarter loss, the automotive giant will temporarily cut production by as much as a third, idling more than 30,000 workers. In addition, 11 facilities employing 29,000 workers will close permanently, starting next year. Although the critics of the closings ranged from labor leaders to H. Ross Perot, the recently ousted member of G.M.'s board, it was widely recognized that most of the plants were obsolete and due for replacement. Most auto industry analysts, and company officials themselves, predicted that this would be only the first and least painful round of shutdowns as G.M. adjusts to the new realities of the American car market."

Donald Fehr, executive director of the Players Association, said yesterday that the union had asked Thomas Roberts, the arbitrator, to act because the owners' lawyers have for the past five weeks refused the players' request to have Ueberroth appear. Roberts has given the owners' side until Jan. 20 to let him know if the commissioner will testify willingly. If not, Roberts could subpoena Ueberroth."

If someone had told him at the time that less than 12 months later he would be the Bears' starting quarterback, ''I would have thought they were crazy,'' he said. And so once again, truth of the National Football League variety has proved to be stranger than fiction. Flutie, the little quarterback from Boston College who threw the pass that beat Miami, who set a major college passing yardage record, who teamed with Herschel Walker to make the Generals the most intriguing U.S.F.L. team nobody remembers, who started the 1986 football season unsure if he would ever again throw a pass that mattered is, indeed, the Bears' starting quarterback."

Residents and visitors alike enjoy the 45-foot-tall Christmas tree in Marshall Field's downtown store, the lights hanging from the trees on North Michigan Avenue and afternoon tea at the Drake Hotel. Even in winter, Chicago is known for its energy - it has bold architectural statements, pulsating jazz and blues clubs, exciting theater and colorful neighborhoods. A good place to start a visit is the Skydeck of the 110-story Sears Tower (open from 9 A.M. to midnight daily; $3), the world's tallest building, at 233 South Wacker Drive. In the sprawling South Side are Hyde Park and the University of Chicago, and farther south and west is Chicago's brawny industrial heart. Also to the west are many ethnic neighborhoods, and beyond them Oak Park, once home to Ernest Hemingway and Frank Lloyd Wright. North of the Sears Tower is downtown, dominated by banks and corporate headquarters. Farther north is the Gold Coast with 90-year-old mansions and lake-view apartments. Beyond that is Evanston, home of Northwestern University. A short drive north of Evanston, on Sheridan Road, is the Bahai Temple in Wilmette. To the east is the lake, threatening in winter, glistening in summer. Architecture Chicago - home of Louis H. Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe - is often considered the first city of American architecture.

Flynn blocked a punt by Bill Renner in the first period. The ball went 12 feet into the air and came down in Flynn's hands at the Packer 36-yard line. ''I just took off,'' he said.

It is also a disservice to all of the starry-eyed teen-agers looking for a role model to paint a compassionate picture of the swaggering athlete hero who was a hard ''drinker, not a drunk.'' Regardless of how you slice it, drinking impaired his life. The cute stories of how he ran into a ''parked swerving streetcar'' or how he drove down a one-way street in the wrong direction not only give the readers a laugh, but they imply acceptance of such behavior, if not condoning it. This one article undoes an enormous amount of hard work by many important groups, like Mothers Against Drunk Driving. It's not sexy to say ''don't drink and drive,'' but it sure comes across clearly when Dave Anderson quotes a sign in the Lions' locker room saying ''Ah ain't drunk. Ah'm from Texas.''

The British Post Office offers a set of five stamps that show how Christmas customs have developed through the centuries. The stamps were inspired by five traditional Christmas customs, some of which survive to this day. A 13-pence issue illustrates the story of the Glastonbury Thorn. The December flowering of the hawthorn at Glastonbury Abbey linked ancient beliefs with the birth of Jesus. The use of greenery at midwinter festivals is rooted in the earliest days of Christianity when evergreens were a symbol of hope."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"AMERICAN MUSICIANS Fifty-six Portraits in Jazz. By Whitney Balliett. 415 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $22.95. Whitney Balliett, the jazz columnist for The New Yorker, has been writing biographical pieces about jazz artists since 1962, and this book collects all 49 articles (and 56 portraits) in one place at last. Of Mr. Balliett's 11 previous books - mostly shorter collections -''American Musicians'' makes at least three entire volumes plus hunks of several others obsolete. His biographical articles are his best, so this is his most valuable book. All of Mr. Balliett's subjects are American instrumentalists except for three Frenchmen, including the violinist Stephane Grappelli, and the Belgian-born guitarist Django Reinhardt. Books about jazz seem to proliferate these days - especially books about jazz before the 1950's, when it was among America's most popular musics. That era attracts readers, perhaps because the music is receding into the past, surviving largely in memory, on reissued records and less satisfactorily in revival performances. Among the subjects of these 56 portraits, only the Modern Jazz Quartet and a dozen others are wholeheartedly ''modern'' musicians - that is, post-Charlie Parker. In fact, the majority are past the age of 65 - or would be if they were still alive - and only two are younger than 55."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"In real estate, as in many other fields, price is the best measure of value. That was proved again last week in Long Beach, a community that had been in decline but more recently has been enjoying a buoyant revival and attracting the interest and the dollars of developers."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"WOMEN-CHURCH Theology and Practice of Feminist Liturgical Communities. By Rosemary Radford Ruether. 306 pp. San Francisco: Harper & Row. $16.95. FLANNERY O'CONNOR once wrote, ''To the deaf, you must shout! And to the near-blind, you must draw large, wild pictures.'' Sometimes it seems as though Rosemary Radford Ruether thinks all of us are deaf and near-blind. But then one must remember to whom Ms. Ruether is used to talking: the Roman Catholic Church - an institution not renowned, as far as feminists are concerned, for its ability either to hear or to see. Ms. Ruether, a professor of theology at Garret-Evangelical Theological Seminary in Evanston, Ill., and author of many books, including ''Sexism and God-Talk,'' deserves a good deal of credit for simply staying in dialogue with this church over the 25 years in which she has taught, lectured and written. It's no wonder, perhaps, that in the process she has lost a measure of moderation."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"THERE are women I know who open their hearts to me, at least when it comes to certain subjects. There is no reserve between us when they tell me how they detest the aroma of my cheap cigars and, once the ice has been broken, they go on to let me know that they cannot understand the male fascination with trains, full-scale and model. They will go to lectures to listen to psychoanalytical reflections on the will to return to the womb, but they cannot comprehend why grown men will utter the male equivalent of rapturous squeals at the sight of a tiny engine towing a string of cars over a minitrack through little tunnels. There is no doubt a good explanation, but I do not have time to wait for the translation from the German."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"THE first year of Governor Kean's second four-year term is drawing to a close and the atmosphere in the State House is almost serene, despite some serious and nagging problems. Counties and municipalities are looking ahead to a new year without $127 million in Federal revenue-sharing, automobile- and commercial liability-insurance problems persist and the Transportation Trust Fund needs a new infusion of money to complete its highway construction and repair programs. The solutions to all these problems entail some political risks, among them a tax increase for the Trust Fund, repeal of a homeowners' tax break to finance aid to the cities and changes in insurance laws, which are certain to upset either insurance companies or trial attorneys."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH,'' SAYS one well-traveled New Yorker, reeling off his list of essentials for a midwinter island sojourn: an unfurled tatami mat, a terry-cloth towel, Top-Siders and a toothbrush. Sparse and casual though it may be, his inventory is true to the spirit of the season, known in fashion jargon as resort. For during that period occurring roughly from mid-November to March, men hone their travel wardrobes to the basics - a handful of cotton shirts and pullovers, loose-fitting khaki or linen shorts and trousers, a sport coat and little more."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Wayne Newton, who has always done well in Las Vegas, was awarded $19.2 million last week by a Federal jury there that found NBC had defamed him in broadcasts linking him to organized crime. The broadcasts - a 1980 report entitled ''Wayne Newton and the Mob'' and two follow-up reports - described the singer's purchase of the Aladdin Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Parts of Westchester County experienced a minor earthquake early yesterday, apparently the latest in a series registered over the last few years. But seismologists said the event was so small that initial checks of their instruments failed to establish its precise time, location or force. A duty officer at the National Earthquake Center in Golden, Colo., Russell Needham, said information from nearby stations indicated that the quake was centered in the Ardsley area, but that it was ''very minor'' and so weak that it would hardly have been felt."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"A year ago, Saudi Arabia's Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani urged the other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to set off a price war in an attempt to win a bigger share of the world oil market. The result was a precipitous drop in prices, from $28 a barrel in December 1985 to a low of $9 in July. Early yesterday morning, with a new Saudi representative in Geneva, OPEC reversed its strategy, agreeing to cut oil production 7 percent and raise the price to $18 a barrel."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"MOST professional football fans do not think there is too much violence in the National Football League, even though they believe serious injuries have increased this season and are caused primarily by dirty play, artificial turf and drug use by the players. Those are the key findings of a New York Times/CBS Sports Poll, which reflected general satisfaction with the state of the game, though about one fan in three called drugs the most important problem facing pro football. Fans were about evenly divided over whether the injury problem was so serious that something had to be done or whether injuries were ''just part of the game,'' but 58 percent of them said there was not too much violence in the N.F.L. Fifty-two percent of the 608 fans responding said they thought serious injuries had increased this season. Of the factors perceived to cause such injuries, dirty play was cited as the most serious by 31 percent of the fans, artificial turf by 23 percent and drug use among players by 23 percent. Smaller percentages attributed injuries to officials' failure to enforce the rules stringently enough and the increased size and speed of the players. The poll, conducted by telephone Dec. 14 and 15, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"How well has television been covering the Iran arms affair? All things considered, pretty well. It's hard to think of angles the correspondents have missed. More important, it's hard to think of angles the correspondents should have ignored, but instead went out and reported. Television journalism can be a thing of excess. One remembers the endless interviews with the families of hostages after terrorists hijacked a jet. The Iran-Nicaragua story, so far, has had no equivalent to that. Grant that some of the reporting has been thin; correspondents have speculated endlessly about the future of Donald T. Regan. Grant also that some of the reporting has been bewildering; Barbara Walters' airborne interview with Adnan M. Khashoggi, for example, left us confused. By and large, however, we can live with all that."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"PORT poured from crystal decanters into small-faceted glasses is a quintessentially civilized pleasure and one the British know how to enjoy. At this season, when thoughts might turn to figgy pudding and roast goose, having port to sip after dinner or in late afternoon evokes all the richness of a Dickensian Christmas. Unlike dry table wines, made from fully fermented juice of the grape, or brandies, which are distilled from wine and aged, port, which is stronger than wine but less alcoholic than brandy, is neither fully fermented nor distilled. Red wine that has not completed fermentation - that is, before all the sugar in the grape juice has turned to alcohol - is poured into casks containing brandy. The brandy stops the fermentation, while it also increases the alcohol. The result is port, a fortified wine that is the splendor of wine-making in Portugal."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"IN quick succession, Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger and Secretary of State George P. Shultz came to NATO headquarters recently to reassure the allies that American foreign policy was on course. But an emerging full-dress debate on the alliance's health and destiny goes well beyond the turmoil in Washington over the Reagan Administration's secret dealings with Iran. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has kept a peace of unprecedented prosperity for almost four decades, has been through such reappraisals before, and one useful rule of thumb seems to be that NATO is never the shambles its critics contend it is, nor the model of harmony described by its boosters. Its latest strains and tensions arise from what some Europeans see as go-it-alone impulses in the United States and what some Americans consider insufficient burden-sharing by the Europeans. And the mostly out-of-power European left is formulating ''alternative defense strategies'' which, if implemented, could give a powerful fillip to American isolationism."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Forget, for a moment, all the unknowns about the Iran-contra scandal. What cries out for debate is well known - that Ronald Reagan's passionate crusade against Communism is the engine that has powered the Oliver Norths of his Administration. Never is the President's fervor more intense than when he gazes southward to Nicaragua, seeing a people ''trapped in a totalitarian dungeon, trapped by a military dictatorship that oppresses, impoverishes them, while its rulers live in privileged and protected luxury and openly boast their revolution will spread.''"
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"In 1969, a member of the President's Cabinet was paid $60,000. Today the figure is $86,200. That's nominally a 44 percent increase, but because of inflation it's worth 54 percent less than the 1969 salary. Members of Congress, who make $75,100, have taken a 43 percent hit. Federal district judges, at $78,700, have lost 36 percent."

The Seahawks (10-6) now must await the outcome of games involving Cincinnati and Kansas City on Sunday and, possibly, New England on Monday night. Two of those teams must lose for Seattle to reach the playoffs."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"The guns are silent and cold, but the memory of their report still echoes across the land. Vietnam lingers, especially for the eager volunteers and luckless conscripts who crossed the Pacific to fight it. They are in their maturity now. They sit in the Congress, they stand along the assembly line, they sell pencils in the street. Some have tried to bury their past and forget the war. Many more have searched for a way to remember. They have a new mission now, one that began when the fighting stopped. This is the mission to make sense of the senseless, to find some provision in a storehouse laid empty by waste."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"FREEDOM from exile for the dissident physicist Andrei D. Sakharov. The end of the Soviet nuclear testing moratorium. The ouster of a non-Russian Politburo member and the open reporting of a subsequent anti-Russian riot in Soviet Central Asia. These extraordinary events last week reflected the growing power and boldness of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, although the Soviet leader was invisible most of the week. The rapid-fire developments seemed to distill in an usually clear way some of the major themes of Mr. Gorbachev's first 20 months in office, including his efforts to enhance Moscow's image, give its diplomacy a new look, induce greater domestic candor and reshuffle the leadership."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"THREATENED with defeat at the polls next November, the most prominent female judge on Long Island, Marie G. Santagata of County Court, the supervising judge of criminal courts in Nassau County, has taken the unusual step of seeking and receiving an appointment as a judge of the State Court of Claims. Judge Santagata, a Democrat from Old Westbury who has been a District Court and County Court judge for 16 years, was confirmed last week by the State Senate as one of the 23 new Court of Claims judges who will be handling drug cases exclusively. She said in an interview that she hoped to remain supervising judge in Nassau, however. That is a strong possibility since she was recommended to the Court of Claims by the state's Chief Administrative Judge, Joseph W. Bellacosa."

The 48-year-old Anthony, who won a record 41 titles and a record $1.2 million between 1970 and 1983, said he planned to bowl in a few tournaments, ''just for fun'' and didn't plan to take his comeback seriously."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Back in their homelands, some of the children had seen the police beat neighbors with billy clubs and guns. Others had heard of killings, payoffs and disappearances. ''The police take people off buses to put them in jails and kill them,'' said Carmen Valencia, 11 years old, who grew up in Colombia and moved two years ago to the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. Her uncle, she said, was forced to pay police officials to keep her father out of jail on what she said were trumped-up charges."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"The crew on the experimental plane Voyager forgot to add oil to their rear engine today, causing an abrupt rise in engine temperature that gave them the biggest scare of their weeklong effort to become the first plane to circle the globe without stopping for fuel. The pilots, Richard Rutan and Jeana Yeager, who took off last Sunday in the craft, an unorthodox H-shaped design of lightweight materials, were over the Atlantic Ocean at 4 A.M. when they noticed the engine was dangerously hot, said Peter Riva, a mission control spokesman. Within 10 minutes they discovered that the engine, one of two on the plane, was nearly two quarts low on oil."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"It was the day before the cobra slithered in front of the car that we rounded the bend in the mountain road a hundred miles or so northwest of Chiang Mai, hit the brakes and stopped just short of the pack of elephants. They were worker elephants, four of them, and they had just stumbled down the hillside and spilled out into the road after a long day of logging. Atop their backs, sitting in broad wicker baskets, was a crew of five loggers, presumably headed home to one of the tiny villages that dot the hillsides of Thailand's northwestern corner, along the Burma border. It's not clear who was more surprised: The two of us looking at the elephant team that had descended from the jungle, or the loggers looking at our once-white Toyota, coated up to the windows with reddish mud. If the loggers were unaccustomed either to visitors or mud-covered rental cars, it would be understandable. Two decades ago, Western visitors almost never ventured into Thailand's remote northwest. Until 1965, there was no paved road connecting the area where the hill tribe people and rice farmers live with the nearest city, the ancient Thai capital of Chiang Mai. Until recently some tribes did not welcome visitors."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"JOSEPH E. ANTONINI could have stepped out of one of those classic American rags-to-riches tales, where the young hero starts out as a humble stock boy, works just a little harder than everyone else, climbs over all the obstacles and - lo and behold - ends up at the top of the heap. For Mr. Antonini, 45, the happy ending seems to be in sight: Four months ago, he was named corporate president and chief operating officer of the K Mart Corporation; he is expected to be named chief executive at the retail company's annual meeting in March, and there is little doubt that he will become chairman in September, when Bernard M. Fauber retires. But in real life, nothing is quite that simple. The irrepressible Mr. Antonini has plenty of challenges ahead, for K Mart, the nation's leading discounter and No. 2 retailer, is in a crucial period of transition. K Mart is caught in a continuing race both to catch up with Sears, Roebuck & Company, the No. 1 retailer, and to stay ahead of the fast-growing Wal-Mart, the second-largest discounter. In the last two years, it has had to run faster and faster just to keep its place."

And you want to know what is happening to Father Rhine.'' Twice last month, the town's 4,000 citizens knew something awful was happening to the river. The big chemical companies of Sandoz and BASF had dumped poisons into it, obliging Unkel to turn off its water pumps and have its supplies trucked in by the all-volunteer fire department."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"HAS there been a decline in the rule of law in Israel? The question was raised again last week in a case being considered by the Israeli Supreme Court. The case involves a French Jew, William Nakash, who was convicted in absentia in France of the murder of a French Arab. Mr. Nakash escaped French justice by fleeing to Israel and becoming a citizen. France asked Israel to extradite him. But Justice Minister Avraham Sharir of the Likud party, contending that he had the discretion to ignore the extradition treaty, ordered Mr. Nakash released. If Mr. Nakash were returned to France, Mr. Sharir argued, he would be a target for Arab revenge in prison. Civil rights activists appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that Israel as a law-abiding nation must hold to its treaty and not harbor Jewish criminals. The court ordered Mr. Nakash held, promising an answer shortly."

In the shoreline town of Madison, Temple Beth Tikvah is growing at such an ''unbelievable'' rate, the rabbi reports, that the synagogue has had to build an addition. And about 32,000 of the state's Roman Catholics recently participated in Renew, a program to help rejuvenate their beliefs. It is a program, a bishop said, that ''came along at the right time.''"

Most of the menagerie of carved carousel animals exhibited there, however, are strutters - and that includes a zebra, goat, chicken, dog, giraffe, camel and ostrich. Only the big brown bear seems immobile, his shaggy head cocked, his eyes shining and his weighty limbs stock still, on hold, perhaps, for hugging. ''Everybody calls it a teddy bear,'' the collector Charlotte Dinger said of the life-sized beast, which predates by more than 20 years the 1902 cartoon of President Theodore Roosevelt refusing to shoot a bear cub, the image that sparked the first stuffed toy teddy bears."

Valenti, the Town Supervisor, discussing plans to ''spruce up the area,'' foresees new sidewalks, trees, lights, a paved parking lot, a community center and new stores attracted by the improvements. An allocation of $175,000 from a Community Development Block Grant will be used for the improvements Mr. Valenti outlined, with the town's contribution of $13,000 and town employees' labor used to turn the railroad station into a community center. Since Metro-North was upgraded, Thornwood has not been a railroad stop and the station is currently used by a local taxi."

Mr. Roth, who was held in jail throughout the trial in lieu of $250,000 bail, showed little emotion as the verdict was read about 9:45 P.M. on the jury's third day of deliberation.

In a narrow but intensely active circle here there has emerged a consuming obsession with the expansion of Communism - which is not in fact going on. Something else is going on: convulsive ethnic conflict. We seem to have no feel for that."

Katonah is at a crossroads of the so-called I-684 Corridor, bordered by the Interstate, the Saw Mill River Parkway and Route 35, a major commuting road.

Sakharov return to Moscow reflected a more flexible policy on human rights and tacit acknowledgment that the treatment of dissidents was linked to other issues like trade and arms control. The Soviet Union announced Friday that Dr. Sakharov, the physicist who was banished to Gorky in 1980 for public criticism of Soviet policies, could come move back. His wife, Yelena G. Bonner, a human rights campaigner who was convicted of anti-Soviet activities in 1984, was pardoned. Dr. Sakharov said Saturday that he planned to continue to speak out on human rights and other issues."

Sexual preference or marital status should only be one of several factors, like age, income, ethnicity and location, that determine appropriate placement of foster children, according to a report issued Wednesday by a 21-member commission appointed by the State Secretary of Human Services, Philip W. Johnston, to study the state's foster care system. In May 1985, Mr. Johnston announced a new policy requiring the state to ask the sexual preference of potential foster parents and, whenever possible, to place children in ''traditional family settings.''"

She ran roadblocks under fire and conducted a steamy Indonesian affair with Mel Gibson in ''The Year of Living Dangerously.'' And in ''Ghostbusters,'' she was a cellist plagued by evil spirits who possessed her kitchen appliances - and then possessed her. In a series of successful movies, Sigourney Weaver has become a screen icon to millions of Americans. The exquisitely chiseled face, the legs that any self-respecting Rockette would die for, the cool intelligence that even the dumbest script can't disguise have combined to make the 37-year-old Ms. Weaver one of the most successful actresses of her generation, not to mention the kind of sex symbol who makes men's eyes glaze."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"RECENTLY I sat on a quiet beach, watching the water and enjoying the late afternoon sun. A father and two small children approached the water's edge. ''Julie, Jimmie, come sit on the rocks,'' Dad commanded. ''I want to take a picture.'' Jimmie and Julie were a photographer's dream. Blond and cherubic, they could do no wrong in front of a camera. But Dad had a preconceived idea. He wanted a picture of his children on the rocks. He waited while Jimmie lifted Julie onto a flat place and smoothed down her bangs. He waited while Julie gave Jimmie a hug. He watched the children compare toes, brush the sand off their hands and wave at a passing gull. Finally, when they were both squinting nicely into the sun over his left shoulder, Dad took the picture. Then he settled into his beach chair to read, while the kids splashed each other at the water's edge."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: The enthusiasm among New Rochelle officials for massive development of Davids Island is shortsighted, resting on dubious assumptions about the general social benefit of such a project. For example, the anticipated tax revenue from luxury condominiums will be diminished by the services the city will have to provide for the additional population, among them police and fire protection, road maintenance and garbage collection. Moreover, the ability of the city's sewage-treatment plant to handle the increased load has not been demonstrated."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Siren, Prism, Prime Minister To provoke good rhetoric is one of the lesser functions of political leaders. In ''The Oxford Book of British Political Anecdotes'' (Oxford University), edited by Paul Johnson, John Maynard Keynes's portrait of Lloyd George is a brilliant piece of controlled apoplexy. How can I convey to the reader, who does not know him, any just impression of this extraordinary figure of our time, this siren, this goat-footed bard, this half-human visitor to our age from the hag-ridden magic and enchanted woods of Celtic antiquity? One catches in his company that flavour of final purposelessness, inner irresponsibility, existence outside or away from our Saxon good and evil, mixed with cunning, remorselessness, love of power, that lend fascination, enthralment and terror to the fair-seeming magician of North European folklore. . . . Lloyd George is rooted in nothing; he is void and without content; he lives and feeds on his immediate surroundings; he is an instrument and a player at the same time which plays on the company and is played on by them too; he is a prism, as I have heard him described, which collects light and distorts it and is most brilliant if the light comes from many quarters at once; a vampire and medium in one. Neither Drums Nor Harp In literary criticism, attack is easier than praise because displeasure is more accessible, and more fun. In celebrating Elizabeth Bishop, Howard Moss is almost obliged to define poetry itself."

Representative George Brown, Democrat of California, said today that Mr. Meese made these remarks on Friday when he appeared before the House Intelligence Committee. But a spokesman for Mr. Meese said Mr. Brown had misrepresentaed what Mr. Meese told the committee. Mr. Reagan underwent surgery for colon cancer on July 18, 1985.

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"DEEP IN THE BACK streets of Naples, the Convent of Santa Chiara has been an oasis of tranquillity and culture since the 14th century. But on an evening in early November, it provided an exceptional backdrop for a dinner party. Some 300 guests gathered there to help celebrate Naples 99, a foundation that arranges for corporate sponsorship of art restorations in and around that city. First, they sipped champagne in the garden cloister, for which the CIGA hotel chain had financed a technical study of the deteriorating majolica tiles that mimic the foliage with subdued colors. Glasses in hand, some strolled to a vestibule to see a small series of frescoes recently cleaned and restored under the sponsorship of the fashion designer Mario Valentino. Then it was on to the Baroque refectory for dinner. Among those present were two Cabinet ministers; a bevy of politicians; the film director Lina Wertmuller; Wanda Ferragamo of the Florentine fashion family, which has just sponsored the restoration of a piece of the Triumphal Arch of Alfonso on Naples's Castel Nuovo; Cesare Romiti, managing director of Fiat, and senior executives of a number of banks, publishing houses and other businesses. Watching the sequins and jewels glittering in candlelight, one woman said, ''It is very special that these people are here for a serious purpose. Fifteen or 20 years ago they would have been doing la dolce vita.''"

Since he moved from northern Virginia to New Jersey a few weeks ago to take over as executive director of the new Office of State Planning, similar oversights have left Mr. Epling shivering through several afternoons. But Mr. Epling is quickly learning to adjust not only to New Jersey weather, but also to its political climate. Most observers agree he is in the hot seat, facing a monumental task, an unforgiving deadline and the uncertainty that goes with being first in a complicated and controversial new endeavor. Governor Kean signed the new State Planning Act last January, establishing a commission and charging it with creating a state development and redevelopment plan within 18 months."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"NOBODY REALLY cares who shot John. That's because who shot John is inherently dismissive, always used in the sense of a question that the speaker is not about to answer because it involves loathsome finger-pointing, unworthy of the fair-minded. When Marlin Fitzwater, press spokesman for Vice President George Bush, was asked about Bush's support of the President's policy to ship arms to Iran, he said, according to The Washington Post, ''that Bush does not want to discuss the process of 'who shot John' in making the Iran decisions.'' The reporter, David Hoffman, quoted the spokesman directly, adding, ''This is a classic example of the kind of thing for six years that George Bush has never commented on, in good times or bad.'' That derogation concerning blame-fixing has been steadily gaining currency. A 1977 recording by Nathan Page used those words as its title, and the expression must have been helped along by the ''Who Shot J.R.?'' promotion of the television drama ''Dallas.'' ''For the first three months of his campaign,'' wrote The Washington Post's T.R. Reid about Senator Edward M. Kennedy's quest for the Presidency in 1980, ''Kennedy flailed around on a sprawling spectrum of issues ranging from who-shot-John-in-Teheran to the wiretap provisions of the criminal code bill.''"
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"WIDELY hailed as the most esthetically pure city-satellite settlement of the 1960's, this celebrated ''new town'' in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington is preparing to shed its carefully nurtured urban-village cocoon and go assertively ''downtown.'' Developers are adding a new kind of citylike high-rise Main Street to Reston's 11.5 square miles of seemingly undauntable neosuburbia, where curving streets named Stirrup Road, Trotter Lane and Gallant Fox Court weave among timbered ''executive campuses'' filled with more office space than in downtown Richmond, the state capital. In planning an urban, straight-line street grid that seems deliberately antithetic to the pseudorustic theme set by Reston's Colt's Neck Road and Polo Fields Court, the well-financed owners of one of America's most successful ''new towns'' may be setting a new national pattern for what could be called a ''new city.''"

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"IN its tranquil setting at the foot of the Ramapos, the Rockland County village of Suffern seems somehow out of sync with its bustling neighbors to the south and east. From its quaint central business district, nearly surrounded by well-kept turn-of-the-century homes, to the northern areas where large properties off quiet country lanes overlook the western mountains, it seems more like a remote upstate hamlet than a village at the hub of one of the most rapidly developing areas in the New York metropolitan region. The pace of development, however, has begun to quicken into a boom in this 2.3-square-mile municipality 33 miles northwest of Manhattan at the interchange of Route 17 and the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway. Just to the south, in Mahwah, N.J., International Crossroads, a 3 million-square-foot high-rise office park is under construction at the site of the former Ford Motor Company auto-assembly plant. The complex, when completed, is expected to provide employment for nearly 7,000 workers."

Truefitt & Hill, London's oldest barbershop, has snipped the locks of Britain's high and mighty ever since it was established in 1805, the year of the Battle of Trafalgar. Over the years, its clientele has included King George IV, Sir Winston Churchill, Field Marshal Montgomery, Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Steiger, Lord Olivier and Prince Philip. Queen Elizabeth's husband gets his hair cut ''up at the palace,'' as one employee put it, a singular departure from the shop's policy of no house calls."

Assuming that he bounces back to his normal self, as usual, he will still leave doubts here about his casual executive style, and the competence of his staff. For the moment, it's not what we don't know about the recent conduct of his office that counts but what we do know. We do know a good deal about his alarming unpreparedness for the summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev at Reykjavik, and we do know that his handling of the Iran-contra scandal was almost as clumsy as the original plan, if that's the right word."

In both instances, the aim was the preservation and conveyance of music - whether in symbols or in the actual sound -and both events proved pivotal in the history of the art. D'Arezzo's scheme of representing pitch on parchment is to music what writing is to literature: a medium of transmission. So is the phonograph, and it is certainly reshaping the course of music in our time. Recording has altered the way most of us listen to music. In contrast to the past, most music today is not heard in the presence of the performer but is electronically transported to some other time and place."

ON June 1, 1962, her 36th birthday, Marilyn Monroe began what would be her final attempt to tell her story. Lies had been told about her, she insisted, and she was going to set the record straight. In addition to the biographical information she had contributed in interviews over the years, she had launched a previous full-scale autobiography in conjunction with the novelist and playwright Ben Hecht. Minus the name of its co-author, ''My Story,'' as that unfinished manuscript was called, was published in 1974 and reissued in paperback this year. For her new venture Marilyn Monroe also had a collaborator, a photojournalist, George Barris. Mr. Barris was obviously a sympathetic co-adjutant. Through June and July Marilyn talked and posed - and drank champagne. Mr. Barris took many soft gentle pictures of her, in bathing suit, towels, beach robe, sweater. But this project, too, was not completed. On Aug. 4 Marilyn Monroe died of an overdose of sleeping pills. More than two decades later, Mr. Barris turned over his photographs to Gloria Steinem for use in her present thoughtful and absorbing biography of the actress."

In November the basketball team stunned cable television viewers across the country when it upset Louisville, the defending national champions, in a tournament in Alaska.

The group's versatility includes its ability to adapt its full strength of 12 musicians to smaller ensembles without losing the flavor of its performances. Currently a seven-piece variation of the Nighthawks is playing on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays through Dec. 30 from 3 P.M. to 6 P.M. in the Park Avenue Plaza, 55 East 52d Street, in a narrow corridor lined with shops. Set up in front of Singular Editions and facing Chartwell Books, playing to an audience that is either standing or sitting on the floor, Mr. Giordano's group moves from early Duke Ellington to classic Jelly Roll Morton, from James Reese Europe's 1914 hit ''Too Much Mustard'' to Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet a decade later, and they play with spirit, polish and a full sense of the joy inherent in this music."

Taking what they knew at the time about each opposition boat, they plugged numbers into a computer to simulate its shape, weight, sail plan and crew strength. Then they ran their own series of boat races, 100 in a day, in mock competition. John Marshall, the team's design coordinator, said during a recent interview that when the results were in, they were largely a mirror of the semifinal scorecard here. Tom Blackaller's USA was unpredictable. The results showed up in ''peaks and valleys.'' As for Chris Dickson's New Zealand, the front-runner in the elimination series, the computer simulation showed a series of races in which Conner's team won or lost by small margins."

As a youngster it was one of those places to be avoided simply because all of the players in those bad dreams of childhood were hiding in the darkness of that space. In truth, those harmless demons of my youth were nothing more than the wrenching squeaks of a settling house and the concealed mysteries floating in my imagination. It was a fear I learned to deal with as any child might. In those early years, that same attic provided the hiding space for things that had to be set aside: precious toys, pointless gifts, outgrown clothing, useless collections and, naturally, Christmas artifacts."

Szladits, curator of the Berg Collection of English and American Literature, backing her words with an appealing new show in the scholarly enclave she bestrides on the third floor of the New York Public Library. ''Women and Literature: English and American Writers From the 18th Century to the Present'' offers a behind-the-scenes look at writers who received recognition, often belated, at times when they were considered presumptuous for invading the ink-stained masculine world of the novel, poetry and history. ''When women in the 19th century wielded pens, they were called poetesses or authoresses,'' Dr. Szladitz says. ''Fanny Burney published her novel 'Evelina' anonymously. Margaret Fuller said that she had 'a man's ambition with a woman's heart.' At least one changed her name - we know Mary Ann Evans as George Eliot. 'Most women do whatever they can,' Louisa May Alcott wrote. Many women 'authoresses' wrote children's stories to make a living. And several books by women - Harriet Beecher Stowe's 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' and Margaret Mitchell's 'Gone With the Wind' - changed history.''"

As a poet, he was a late bloomer - 35 years old when he began to write the poems in his first book, ''Harmonium,'' and 44 when it was published in 1923. In the best-known glimpses we have of him he is already the imposing, remote vice president of the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company composing verses in his head as he walks to work. Even the famous story of his fist fight with Hemingway comes from his later years - he was close to 60 when he threw those drunken punches. No youthful high jinks there."

They not only concern whom New York faces in the playoffs - as well as when and where - but more important: Just where are they at right now?"

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"After every defeat, every embarrassing performance, someone suggests that it couldn't get any worse. And yet it does. Last night, before an announced crowd of 9,535 very displeased spectators at Madison Square Garden, the Knicks sank to new depths, stumbling through a performance so utterly without value that the team was booed throughout the final period. That was when the Indiana Pacers, a team that had lost six consecutive games on the road, humiliated the Knicks. Led by the most explosive performance of the season for Chuck Person, the rookie forward, the Pacers scored 42 points in that final 12 minutes to cruise to a 123-99 victory. The Knicks suffered their eighth straight defeat and their 21st over all, more than any other team in the league."

The stowaway remained aboard the ship."

''The program needs to go in another direction,'' the 39-year-old coach said as he stepped down and turned the team over to his assistant, Ron Krayel, 41, who will serve as interim coach. Kornegay, a former Hawk guard who spent seven years as an assistant before taking over as head coach in 1976 and compiling a 129-130 record, will retain the post of assistant athletic director he has held for five years."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"MOST pro football teams are coached by strangers in town with little or no feeling for a team's past. But the coach who has restored the Giants' glory grew up rooting for other Giants teams of glory. Bill Parcells is a New Jersey guy who had Giant pennants on the wall in his room as a youngster. And now, in guiding his Giants to a 14-2 record, the most victories in any of the franchise's 62 seasons, he deserves to be the National Football League's Coach of the Year. ''You've got so many people you know here,'' the 45-year-old coach was saying. ''And they're genuinely happy that somebody from New Jersey is doing it. You can see it, you can feel it. And they have a tremendous loyalty to you because you're one of them.''"

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"THE 92d Street Y assembled a formidable assortment of chamber musicians for its program this week, and the Wednesday evening concert was, by and large, a delight. One's reservations had to do with the dubious need to play a mid-1950's pastiche of quintet music by Boccherini when so many fine, unadulterated scores by that composer are waiting to be heard, and the otherwise estimable acoustics of the Kaufmann Concert Hall, which seemed to rob the concluding Mendelssohn Octet of some of its gossamer lightness. The musicians on hand were the violinist Jaime Laredo, who leads the Chamber Music at the Y series and who took the dominant first-violin part in the Mendelssohn; Peter Oundjian, first violinist of the Tokyo Quartet; Michael Tree, violist of the Guarneri Quartet, and Sharon Robinson, the cellist and Y regular. Joining them were the young members of the Ridge String Quartet, Krista Bennion Feeney, Robert Rinehart, Ah Ling Neu and Ramon Bolipata, who sounded in no way deferential to their seniors."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"The shutdown of the Government-owned nuclear reactor at Hanford, Wash., one of the main sources of plutonium for the nation's nuclear arsenal, has set the stage for a major debate over how this country produces the raw material for nuclear bombs, and how much more is needed. Costs, jobs, environmental concerns and the security of the nation all promise to weigh as factors in this debate. For years the Department of Energy has asked Congress for a new plutonium-producing reactor, at a cost that the department puts at $2 billion to $3 billion but that critics say would be much higher. Congress has refused to provide the money. In addition to the facility at the Hanford reservation, the N-Reactor, the Government has three more plutonium producers at its Savannah River Plant, near Aiken, S.C. But one of those, the C-Reactor, has been shut since June 1985 because of cracks in the reactor vessel that technicians are not sure how to fix. Roger Rollins, a nuclear engineer for the department, said Friday that engineers had so far found no way to weld the cracks, raising doubt about whether the reactor could ever be operated again."

Throughout the day, thousands of students poured into a huge expanse of pavement known as People's Square. Thousands of others demonstrated outside city government offices on the tree-lined Bund, the promenade along the west bank of the Huangpu River. In People's Square, students carried huge placards reading, ''Long Live Freedom,'' and ''Give Us Democracy,'' the foreigners said."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"What Robert Frank's ''The Americans'' was to the 1950's, Nan Goldin's ''The Ballad of Sexual Dependency'' is to the 1980's. The 800-image ''ballad'' - a sweeping, diaristic and critical account of life within the photographer's own artistic, urban subculture - reflects the same dissatisfaction with contemporary life evident in ''The Americans'' and extends the narrative potentials of still photography that Frank's book revealed. At the same time, it serves to gauge the distance between the existential angst of Frank's time and today's sense of social and cultural atomization. Goldin, at the age of 33, has created an artistic masterwork that tells us not only about the attitudes of her generation, but also about the times in which we live."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"UNTIL about six weeks ago, those who profess to know who's who in this town said that Paul A. Volcker had become a lame duck - a man whose chances of being reappointed head of the Federal Reserve had fallen well below 50-50 and who had begun to weigh seriously some of the juicy seven-figure-a-year offers dangling before him. Some observers even said they detected a certain detachment in Mr. Volcker's performance in the world's mightiest financial job. He had, they said, not engaged in the subtle lobbying that would have signaled his eagerness to remain in power. Mr. Volcker's departure, in many eyes, would be a sharp blow to confidence in American economic policy making and could lead, among other things, to a run on the dollar. Like two of his modern predecessors, William McChesney Martin Jr. and Arthur F. Burns, Mr. Volcker has come to be seen as an almost impossibly tough act to follow."

When the children he plays catch with come by his parents' house and ask him about the fight with the police last Saturday night, Gooden said, ''I just put it as a misunderstanding.'' But that is not what Jerry Halstead, a regional vice president for A. L. Williams, a national marketing firm, said he saw when he stopped for a minute at the scene that night.

Donovan. The prosecutor, Philip Gaynor, an assistant Bronx District Attorney, said he feared that if he ''vigorously'' questioned the witness he might affect her status as a fair and impartial juror in the Donovan case. Mr. Donovan and eight other defendants in that trial, now 12 weeks old, are accused of perpetrating a $7.4 million fraud against the New York City Transit Authoriity. Mr. Gaynor asked the judge in the robbery trial, Acting Justice Elrich A. Eastman of State Supreme Court, to suspend proceedings until after the Donovan trial, which he said could take another two or three months. Justice Eastman instead ordered the dismissal of charges against the defendant, Bennie Lovett. He had been accused in a six-count indictment of beating a nurse on Fordham Road near Fordham University and taking her pocketbook containing $75 in May 1985. The prosecution had completed its presentation of the evidence. The defendant was freed immediately after the judge's ruling on Tuesday."

''The President has done a lot of things,'' Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader, said in an interview. ''He urged the appointment of a special counsel, he let his people testify on the Hill, and so on. But there's still a lot of confusion out there, still a feeling that he has to do something bold himself to clear the air.''"
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"A MOOD of frustration and uncertainty gripped the capital last week as three Congressional committees tried unsuccessfully to discover the full story behind the Administration's secret arms deal with Iran. The attempts by investigators to follow all the twists in the tale kept running into the same obstacle: the refusal of the two key players, Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, to tell what they know. At week's end, Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, the Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said, ''We really don't know the answers to the key questions.'' The task of finding those answers now shifts to two select committees, one in each chamber, that were named last week by Congressional leaders. But these panels, which will be formally established when Congress reconvenes in January, will also have responsibilities far broader than the search for specific facts and figures."

''Now, more than any other time of the year, it's caveat emptor, or let the buyer beware,'' said Mr. Bruner, who is surprisingly cheerful for one who deals with flimflams, scams, broken contracts and the myriad other problems consumers are heir to year-round. ''Basically I'm optimistic because the majority of people are honest,'' he said. ''But Christmas is the time to especially watch out for the charities that are out-and-out frauds, as well as those who spend more to raise money than they do on the charity program. ''We run checks on all the familiar charity organizations,'' he continued, ''and we know how much they spend for what. In the philanthropic business, 25 to 30 percent is the accepted amount allowed for salaries and overhead; anything beyond that is suspicious. We turn up several every year that spend more than 50 percent of the money collected on salaries alone.''"
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"THE briefing officer at the Strategic Air Command headquarters in Omaha tapped his pointer on a bar graph comparing targets in the Soviet Union to nuclear warheads in the United States arsenal. ''To retaliate,'' he said, ''it would take more than double what we have on the ramp now.'' Despite President Reagan's multibillion-dollar modernization of strategic forces, begun five years ago, the armed services say the gap between targets and warheads has not been closed. There are more and stronger Soviet targets, and Administration policy decrees that the military be able to hit them repeatedly; in addition, political disputes and technical problems have delayed parts of the President's program."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Gaetano Donizetti had already composed approximately 70 operas, was wracked with syphilis and near mental collapse when he wrote his comic masterpiece ''Don Pasquale'' in 1842. That the resultant work is so youthful and affirmative, with melodies and characters that have lost none of their vividness in the last 145 years, is something of a miracle. Indeed, one thinks of Mozart's Clarinet Concerto, written on what the composer knew would be his deathbed yet imbued with a graceful, almost teasing wit and serenity."

The Zagers hope the New York State Supreme Court will agree. Elissa and Jonathan Zager, backed by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Animal Legal Defense Fund, have asked the court to reverse a lower-court decision in the case, which involves injuries to the dog, and support their position that ''an animal who has achieved the status of a member-of-a-family unit cannot simply be treated as if it were a vase or other inanimate object of personal property.''"
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"To the Sports Editor: We would like to express our very real concern at what we here interpret as a serious blow to the image of American sportsmanship. Over many years, your great country has produced fine sportsmen who were true champions - people who strove their hardest to win but accepted reversals with good grace and dignity. It is, therefore, particularly disappointing to see the heritage of sportsmanship that these great people have bestowed on your country (and the world) besmirched by the petulant posturing and sour grapes of some of the yachting people presently competing in the America's Cup."

The most widely publicized example has been opposition to a long-planned diversion of rivers from Siberia to arid Central Asia. Public criticism led the Government to abandon the project earlier this year as too costly and possibly harmful to the environment. But other undertakings such as dams and associated hydroelectric power plants, some well along in their construction, have also become embroiled in public debates."

Creditors have filed foreclosure and other legal actions to recover overdue interest payments on loans, as well as unpaid bills for goods and services to Triad and its subsidiaries. Alarmed that Triad may be unable to pay millions of dollars in debts, one of its creditors won a temporary restraining order in Federal District Court here on Dec. 10 to block the proposed sale of a profitable oil company owned by the Triad subsidiary, Triad Energy. The sale would be to a Canadian company in which Mr. Khashoggi and Triad's president, Donald Fraser, are major stockholders and officers. In papers filed with the court, the creditor, Sheraton Corporation, asserted that the plan to sell Edgington Oil Company of Long Beach, Calif., to Skyhigh Resources, based in Vancouver, was made with ''intent to hinder, delay and defraud Triad's creditors.''"
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Tom Wicker's argument (''Beware That Mandate,'' Dec. 5) that four modern Presidents (Roosevelt, Johnson, Nixon and perhaps Reagan) have been stalemated after landslide election triumphs can be carried much further. Landslides are not the only cause of that dangerous combination of ignorance and arrogance that has bedeviled modern Presidents and us. Commonly perceived crises or unusually high Presidential popularity may also produce a suspension of our traditional constitutional system of separated institutions sharing, and struggling over, power. Our recurring national crises are not just the result of venal and mean-spirited Presidents and their aides or of a gullible public, although we have experienced both. I would argue that the country suffers from a kind of constitutional schizophrenia, between the traditional constitutional system and a 20th-century version of elective kingship or constitutional dictatorship."

What does Madame Bovary Look Like? We know that she has dark hair and eyes of a complicated color, but what of her nose, her chin? Does she tuck neatly into your shoulder? Are her ankles trim? How do you visualize the set of her shoulders? Of all the great fictional heroines, Emma is probably the one about whose appearance readers are most likely to disagree. We cannot, as with Dickens, refer to some foxed engraving in an early edition, since Flaubert hated and forbade illustrations of his works. Moviegoers might picture Emma as Jennifer Jones, but since this would entail Flaubert himself resembling James Mason, it doesn't take us very far. Mario Vargas Llosa fell deeply in love with Emma from the moment he first read ''Madame Bovary'' - in Paris in 1959 -and at the start of this unconventional, shiningly intelligent and fiercely sensible homage to Flaubert he recounts how ever since he has been in thrall to Emma's social rebelliousness, her erotic power, her vulgarity and her promise of violence. But at no point does he describe her physically. Is it possible to be in love with a woman and not know what she looks like? Or perhaps he is jealously guarding his image of her from the rest of us."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"EVERY home handyman knows that if he wants to cut a piece of wood he will need a carpenter's saw, and if he wants to cut metal he will pick up a hacksaw. But what does one use to cut a piece of ceramic tile, or a brick? Many will be surprised to learn that these materials can be easily cut at home with a hand saw or a power saw - as long as you have one of the special abrasive saw blades that are made for just such difficult-to-cut materials. Originally manufactured by only one company - the Remington Arms Company of Bridgeport, Conn., which is still the leading producer of these blades and sells them under the brand name of Grit Edge - abrasive blades of this type are now made by several other manufacturers. The principal difference between these blades and conventional saw blades is that these do not have cutting teeth in the usual sense. Instead of lots of little teeth that serve to chisel through or chip away the material being cut - saw teeth work like so many tiny little chisels - these blades have thousands of very sharp abrasive particles embedded along the cutting edge. The abrasive material is tungsten carbide, a manmade abrasive and one of the hardest materials known to man."

Wood of Laurel Hollow. ''N.Y.U. opened my eyes to the world,'' said the 43-year-old marketing expert, who made a substantial donation to the center as an expression of his gratitude. Mr. Wood, an N.Y.U. graduate who parlayed a $1,700 investment into financial success as a founder of Candlelite Music, which marketed millions of dollars in ''golden oldies'' recordings on television, is today the president of the Marketing Capital Corporation. The privately held concern, founded in 1972 by Mr. Wood and based in Cold Spring Harbor, provides direct marketing management and creative consulting services to companies eager to market their goods to consumers. And it acts as a venture capital company - investing start-up funds sought by companies or individuals developing new products, usually to be sold by direct mail."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"There are people who take up going to concerts and listening to recordings with a singleness of purpose and fervor that would not have been out of place in the Children's Crusade. Rather often, these are authentic melomaniacs, amateur musicians or metamusicians whose whole beings tremble at the sound of music and want nothing more than to allow it to possess them, body and spirit. However, the ranks of the afflicted include many more whose plight is less explainable: people who took piano lessons as children and were quickly persuaded to give up, failed voice students or literary critics who have lost interest in books and turned to record connoisseurship as a substitute."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"ON the Bingham estate overlooking the Ohio River outside Louisville, Ky., Barry Bingham Sr. and Barry Bingham Jr. live in houses separated by a short walk across a tended lawn. But each rarely crosses that short space to visit the other's home. ''It's like the green line in Beirut separating the Christians and the Moslems,'' said Joan Bingham, an in-law. The father and his only living son have barely spoken since Barry Sr. announced last Jan. 9 his decision to sell the family's media empire, including The Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times, the Pulitzer Prize-winning newspapers that had been in the family for nearly 70 years. Barry Jr., who had managed the enterprises for the last 15 years, denounced the sale as ''a betrayal'' and, almost overnight, the Binghams became a public archetype of a family destroyed in a struggle over business. The year since then has been a period of lingering bitterness, grief and unrepentance. Barry Jr. crossed the lawn on Thursday to bring Christmas presents to his parents, a gesture he described as ''correct.'' The whole family has not gathered for Christmas since 1983, and this year will be no exception."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"FOR the first time since the Communists took power in China nearly four decades ago, opportunities are being created for foreign nationals living and working in its major cities to buy their own apartments or town houses. The Chinese have customarily been been reluctant to allow foreigners to occupy local housing (except in emergencies or by special permit), since it is in desperately short supply. In addition, it is usually deficient by Western standards. Until now, foreigners generally have either lived in hotel rooms that they used as offices or rented hotel-service apartments or suites attached to hotels on a short-term basis. Lately, a severe shortage of available space and an increasing demand by foreign businesses has driven rents up - a suite at one of the better Western-style hotels costs as much as $9,000 a month - and increased the pressure for alternatives. There are no controls on the prices foreigners can be charged for housing."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"There is new life bubbling beneath the barrenness of the American small town, a place that once embodied our rosiest ideals and has long since fallen on hard times. The sober plainness of middle-American existence is seldom represented as such any more; indeed, the town itself has become something of an anachronism, replaced in our imaginations by the suburb, the urban backwater or the family farm. What was once the center of both fond imaginings and satirical outrage - of Norman Rockwell's world and of Sinclair Lewis's Main Street - has grown more and more apt to be regarded, with sadness and pity, as a wasteland. Lately, though, something different has begun to color the ways in which small-town life is depicted. It's something encouraging, and something mischievous too. As Jonathan Demme's ''Something Wild'' presents it, and as such other new films as David Byrne's ''True Stories'' and David Lynch's ''Blue Velvet'' have suggested, it's the energy that bursts forth from what at first seems to be a moral and emotional vacuum, a vacuum so absolute that it holds forth a kind of promise. This life looks so lifeless, these films seem to say, that there must be huge reserves of energy and imagination hidden beneath it. And liberating the lost souls who are trapped there becomes an act of inspired subterfuge."

U.S. Considers Its Response United States intelligence confirmed the Chadian account, officials said.

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Following are answers to some recent questions from readers of the Personal Finance column. Q. I just quit my job to start my own business and have received about $50,000 in a lump-sum payment from my pension. I'm tempted to invest it in Australian bonds, which I hear are yielding 14 percent. Is that wise? Also, if I roll over the proceeds into an Individual Retirement Account within 60 days, I can defer paying tax on the distribution. Is it all right for me to use the earnings on the $50,000 during this two-month period to meet my operating expenses, rather than plowing them back into an I.R.A.? And because I'm considering using part of the money to buy an apartment, what would happen if I rolled over only part of the $50,000? A. Alexandra Armstrong, head of a Washington financial planning firm, takes a dim view of Australian bonds, no matter how appealing their yield. ''When you invest abroad in individual bonds, you have to think about not only the company issuing the bonds - and foreign accounting rules are not the same as ours - but also exchange rate fluctuations.'' If you're determined to invest abroad, Miss Armstrong suggests mutual funds, particularly the new Templeton Income Fund, which invests in debt securities of foreign governments. The fund carries an 8 1/2 percent sales charge."

In one sense, the fears were well-founded. ''Alcohol advertisers have pulled out, causing quite a void,'' said Mr. Bryant of American Passage. Seagram's, for example, once one of his firm's largest clients, has completely stopped advertising in college newspapers. ''They went from a seven-figure budget to zero,'' he said."

PEOPLE entrapped and grotesquely transformed by a civilization obsessed with power and bloodless abstractions hardly represent a recent condition. But finding a means suitable to present this is challenging to artists of any age precisely because the true horror and pain of most people's lives usually seem so routine, so natural. This is why many of the most compelling portrayals of civilization's deforming and alienating influences have been produced by eccentric visionaries - artists such as Hieronymus Bosch, William Blake or Franz Kafka, who break through the comfortable veil of what passes for realism to reveal realms of nightmarish intensity and uncomfortable familiarity."

After months of debate within his administration, Mayor Koch said in an interview yesterday that he was convinced that changes were needed in the system of 28 inspectors general, who oversee activities in city agencies and several quasi-independent authorities. The central change will be that final control over the inspector general in each city agency will now be held solely by the city commissioner of investigation, who will set the salary, budget and agenda for the inspectors general. Inspectors general now report to both the commissioner of investigation and the commissioner of the agency they oversee, who controls their salary, budget and promotion."

Originally organized as a legal jazz group, the society, with its 4,000 members, was officially disbanded when the Czechoslovak Government charged that it was engaging in activities that extended beyond the spread of jazz. But the society, initially known as the Jazz Section of the Musicians' Union, continued to operate unofficially, and its bulletin, with articles on art and cultural life abroad, was mimeographed and passed from hand to hand. Now, after three years of skirmishing, the Government is seeking to put a stop to the organization on what its members say is the pretext of engaging in illegal economic activity."

But that doesn't seem to square with the discovery by the F.B.I. of Saudi links to a suspect Swiss bank account that may have been used in the complicated transaction; and the denial is taken with a large grain of salt by some Middle East experts who are familiar with Saudi affairs and attitudes. They say it was only to be expected that Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi arms peddler who helped arrange the U.S.-Iran deal, insisted to Barbara Walters on national television that the Saudis had not been involved. In their view, his statement provided only another layer of ''cover'' for a Saudi royal family that could have stopped but instead gave the green light to the arms sale."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Prime Minister Jacques Chirac won a bitter political test of strength with President Francois Mitterrand today. After a tumultuous session of Parliament lasting all night and most of today, Mr. Chirac, a neo-Gaullist, won enactment of a new law allowing more flexible working hours in French offices and factories. Mr. Mitterrand's Socialists had opposed the measure. The move was seen by political observers as an attempt by Mr. Chirac to regain some of the authority he lost this month when protesting students forced his Government to abandon a plan to change the educational system. Earlier this week, Mr. Mitterrand refused to allow the Prime Minister to enact the measure on working hours by administrative decree, saying it was socially regressive and must be voted on by Parliament. It was the third time the President had prevented the Government from enacting special legislation by witholding his signature since the two leaders began their power-sharing experiment seven months ago."

The Polish Theater Institute of New York has mounted a touring production of the Pastoralka created by the Polish director Leon Schiller, and will present it next Sunday at 1 P.M. at Haller Veterans Post in New Britain. As in commedia dell'arte, there are a number of stock characters who invariably show up in the Pastoralka, including Satan, Herod's wife (usually played by a man), a donkey, and, of course, angels. Within this framework, however, any number of theatrical and musical variations are possible."

From the outside, the three-level mall looked like a pile of blocks. Inside, however, everything was engineered to cause people to spend money. The spatial grandeur and the tranquillity acted as a balm to jerky nerves. Christmas ornaments festooned the central walkway, where squalling children were lined up to get their pictures snapped with Santa Claus. Shopping malls are fantasy cities in which no one lives but everyone buys. Southdale is 144 stores, 1.1 million square feet, 6,500 parking stalls, an indoor structure where the temperature is always 68 degrees - a climate-controlled, rigidly programmed selling machine. As Mr. Bergan roamed through Southdale, the hubbub registered as sales per square foot, a key ingredient of the rent formula. He looked at J.B. Hudson Jewelers, one of the prides of the mall, and saw $650 a foot. The jewelers, he pointed out, do best. Women's apparel stores, though, dominate the mall. Mr. Bergan grinned when he passed The Limited; it was doing better than $600 a foot."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"IT HAS BEEN 16 years since my friend Sherley Koteen and I decided that a small dinner at home with close friends was a more compatible way to spend New Year's Eve than going to the splashiest party at a restaurant or club. Nothing in the intervening years has changed our minds. Or the minds of our regulars, several of whom have been guests at our black-tie dinners in Washington since 1970. Looking back over those menus recently, I was struck with the story they told about our changing tastes. Not only how much simpler the meals have become, but how the lines have been blurred between culinary styles. Pure French food has virtually disappeared; rich sauces have been replaced by spices. Our New Year's Eve dinners are a microcosm of the evolution in American dining, though from time to time my co-host puts her foot down at what she considers my avant-garde ideas. When I suggested that this year we serve diner food - meatloaf and mashed potatoes - she suggested that I had taken leave of my senses. It was hardly a suggestion I would have made, even in jest, in the early 1970's, a time when a formal meal was incomplete without beef and six courses."

For the occasion, he engaged Gerard Schwarz - then the New York Philharmonic's principal trumpeter and a sometime conductor -who assembled and led a freelance orchestra, and played the second concerto's solo trumpet part in the bargain. As Mr. Schwarz and company played, Mr. Hirshbein wondered whether he could persuade the Y's board to sponsor a resident chamber orchestra. At intermission, he hinted to a few reviewers that the Brandenburg concert was something of a trial run for a planned series; and the critics, delighted with the performance, carried Mr. Hirshbein's notion to the Y's board by reporting that a new ensemble of this group's caliber would be a valuable addition to the city's musical life. Within a week, Messrs. Hirshbein and Schwarz had mapped out the five-concert series that became the inaugural season of the Y Chamber Symphony. Since then, the orchestra, with Mr. Schwarz at its helm, has become one of this city's musical success stories. It plays nearly 40 concerts a season, including subscription programs, a Baroque series, children's concerts, a series of lecture concerts called ''Musically Speaking'' and a few out-of-town performances."

The association, situated on property containing Paine's tiny cottage at 983 North Avenue, has parlayed the relationship into a fund-raising dinner honoring Paine's 250th birthday Jan. 29. Sir Richard will be the speaker."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"IF one had to sum up 1986 in personal computing, one would probably call it the ''Year of the Clone.'' In countless businesses throughout the land, the old motto ''You can't be faulted for buying I.B.M.'' has been displaced by ''I saved the company a bundle by buying (fill in the blank) personal computers.'' I would not say that the International Business Machines Corporation is about to roll over and pull a Peanut on its PC line. Its personal computers, after all, are what transformed Big Blue's logo from a corporate icon to a household name."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"The Bonus Payoff Here's a thought for the bonus season: According to F. Thomas Juster, professor of economics at the University of Michigan, fewer than 10 percent of American companies give bonuses. If more did, he says, it would give the nation's savings rate - and thus the economy - a lift, as more money would be available for business investment. People tend to save, not spend, lump-sum payments, if they are large enough, says Mr. Juster. In Japan, where the savings rate is high - about 15 percent of the gross national product, compared with about 3.1 percent in the United States - workers get most of their annual income in the form of bonuses."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"The plight of those with AIDS is often cited by contributors to the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Steven Seifert of Manhattan gave $100 and requested that, ''if at all possible,'' it be given ''to one of the truly neediest cases - a person with AIDS whose traumatic experience with the disease has forced him into hardship.'' From Philadelphia, Andrew E. Behrendt sent $25, saying, ''I am concerned that this year not enough support services are being provided to persons with AIDS.''"
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Ending a five-year legal dispute, Donald J. Trump and tenants of a Central Park South building announced yesterday that they had reached an agreement allowing the developer to renovate the structure he once wanted to demolish. A 30-page contract, formalizing details of a tentative agreement last March, was signed last Thursday by Mr. Trump, the 40-member 100 Central Park South Tenants' Association and William B. Eimicke, Commissioner of the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"ARCHITECT-DESIGNED houses, usually associated with people who get around in yachts and limousines, have in recent years become competitive housing alternatives for less well-traveled home buyers. One reason is that home prices in parts of metropolitan New York have risen faster than the prices that the careful consumer needs to pay for land and custom-home construction. Building a house, though, is rarely in the realm of alternatives for most home buyers who are not familiar with the process of assembling land, lender, builder and architect. The following profiles of three home-building projects provide an anecdotal guide to some different ways of dealing with the financial, construction and design challenges."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"The Reagan Administration has exaggerated the Soviet Union's ability to invade Iran, according to a study made public this week by a Washington-based research group. The report, by a research associate at the Brookings Institution, asserts that Soviet forces would find it difficult to conduct a full-scale invasion of Iran because some of the terrain is difficult to cross and the Iranian transportation system is limited and vulnerable to attack. ''A Soviet invasion of Iran would be an exceedingly low-confidence affair,'' said Joshua M. Epstein, a research associate at Brookings, who wrote the study. ''That is a fact they have known for roughly 40 years.''"

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"BEGINNING in January, corporations will be able to own cooperative apartments without endangering the tenant-shareholders' special tax status, a change that raises a host of new issues for co-op boards and their shareholders. In the past, the Internal Revenue Service has held that maintenance income from units owned by corporations was commercial, as opposed to shareholder, revenue. Under the I.R.S.'s ''80-20'' rule, no more than 20 percent of a co-op's total revenue can be derived from commercial sources or it will lose its special tax status, under which tenant-shareholders are allowed the traditional tax advantages of home ownership. These are deductibility of their proportionate share of the building's mortgage interest and property tax and deferral of the profits from the sale of the apartment."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"IN his novel ''Roger's Version,'' John Updike pits a skeptical theologian, desperately clinging to the distant God of Karl Barth, against a conservative and naive divinity student in a fierce debate over whether the existence of God can be proved. As I sit at my desk, looking at a slender volume entitled ''Jesus and the Word'' (1926) by the skeptical and sometimes Barthian Rudolf Bultmann, and the much larger and more confident ''Jesus and Judaism'' (1985) by E. P. Sanders, I wonder whether the 20th century has not witnessed a similar debate over the historical Jesus. The comparison is not quite apt. Mr. Sanders, neither conservative nor naive, does not represent the antithesis to Bultmann; that role belongs to the exegetical acrobats of an earlier generation, conservative Protestants and Roman Catholics who wrote lives of Jesus that desperately sought to harmonize the discordant testimony of the four Gospels. The Catholic lives seem especially poignant today, since often they were the result of official pressure. Many of their authors knew better, but they were subjected to censorship and silencing by the Vatican. Mr. Sanders' book, by contrast, is an honest attempt to avoid both the minimalism of a Bultmann and the uncritical acceptance of the Gospels by fundamentalists who treat them like videotape replays."

Begun 18 years ago as a labor of love and a change from his work as a cemetery superintendent, the collection of Santas, elves, reindeer, and all manner of motorized figures has cost him about $150,000. Each Christmas, his friends in the Ballouville section of Killingly help Mr. Whipple haul his collection of figures out of storage and set them up for public exhibition in scenic vignettes of Santa waking up on the day of Christmas Eve; Christmas in picturesque, old Bavaria; medieval monks celebrating the birth of Christ; the saga of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, a family of beavers industriously preparing for the holidays, and so on. ''I made some of them myself,'' Mr. Whipple, 58 years old, said. ''Others I purchased from manufacturers who make the window displays for Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor. I started with three figures the first year, now we spend eight weeks setting up for a display that lasts four weeks. Last year we had 29,094 people come to see it from 29 states and 12 countries.''

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Every now and then, in a moment of uncommon quiet, the distinctive wail of a rural love song rises from some unseen corner of Bangkok, and the urge to get out of town becomes overwhelming. The sound of upcountry music, the rare scent of fresh earth or flowers, or the sight of hill tribe people in traditional dress squatting in front of a video shop are reminders that beyond this polluted, traffic-clogged city, there is another Thailand. It can be found in almost any direction: north to the cool mountains, south along an endless seacoast, west into peaceful river valleys, northeast into the majestic world of the Mekong. Although the number of tourists traveling beyond Bangkok from Japan, Hong Kong and Europe is increasing, this is a country that is mostly still off the tourist track, while easily manageable for independent travelers. Visitors willing to put up with some fairly basic hotels and eating places enjoy in return remarkably varied scenery and the atmosphere of a nation reflecting Sinetic, Indic and Malay cultures, yet always very Thai. That means Thai (or Chinese-Thai) food in every town, and the ubiquitous enthusiasm with which Thais try to please visitors."

The first thing, of course, is to open the box - but gingerly, so as not to drop its contents or damage the box, which will come in handy if the camera is returned or sent for repairs. In the typical camera package, a shallow tray or depression on the top block of Styrofoam holds an instruction book, a warranty card (unless, heaven forfend, this is a gray-market camera) and the battery for the camera's meter, shutter, shutter release and who knows what else."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"The Christmas season is slipping into high gear in Puerto Rico and for many the party will not stop until mid-January. There are religious observances, of course, but the triumph of consumerism shows the increasingly secular grip on the holidays in San Juan, the capital. The Plaza de las Americas in the Hato Rey section, described as the most successful shopping center in the Caribbean, is thronged with shoppers all week, as usual at this time of year, and now on Sundays, too, since a ban on Sunday shopping was ended over the protests of religious groups. Consumer debt is reported up 53 percent on an island whose three million residents have a negative rate of personal savings and where 6 out of 10 people qualify for food stamps."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"THE parking lot of the local train station is something of a La Brea Tar Pits for fossil cars - littered with rows and rows of jalopies and old relics, formerly splendid coupes and heroic hot rods. The ''station car'' is a sorry creature, a truly persecuted vehicle. Bruised and scratched and kicked around, it is like a poor old nag that should have been put out to pasture ages ago but must continue to labor for the sole purpose of shuttling communters to and from the train station each day. It is well past its prime - beauty and paint long since faded, muffler now sagging, body speckled with rust spots that come with age. It is an object of ridicule, carefully camouflaged in the evening (covered with twigs and branches and leaves) because it is such an eyesore in the driveway. Indeed, the status of the station car lies rather shakily near the bottom of the spectrum, where it perhaps outshines only that most ominous roadster driven by ''the new teen-age driver.''"
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"On her 76th birthday Katherine O'Connor received dozens of phone calls from children saying that they loved her. And not a single child knew who she really was.

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Jean-Bedel Bokassa sat in a hard-backed wooden chair today and squirmed under hard questioning from a judge. Witnesses were lying, said Mr. Bokassa, who was once His Imperial Majesty Bokassa I, Emperor of the Cradle of the Bantus. The former Emperor, in mumbled replies that were broadcast live over the national radio, assured the court that contrary to other testimony, the Cabinet minister who had been chained in a windowless cell was to be fed more than ''a piece of meat and half a glass of water a day.'' For Africa, where human rights violators rarely face their victims in a court, the public trial of Mr. Bokassa in a civilian court sets a precedent. For the leadership of this landlocked country, allowing the deposed Emperor to address the nation in daily live broadcasts represents a bold political gamble."

Such ''renewals'' are a trademark of ruling Communist parties from Moscow to Havana, a reflection of the difficulty of motivating societies with a centralized economy and an ideology that for the most part admits no heresy. For Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, the problem is greatly exacerbated by severe economic hardships. At party congresses in Hanoi last week and in Laos last month, there was an extraordinary outpouring of self-criticism, expressed in usual catchwords such as ''shortcomings,'' ''serious mistakes,'' ''selfishness,'' ''laziness'' and ''corruption.'' Cambodia, too, has acknowledged its troubles, reshuffling its leadership in the last several weeks."

It captured the concern throughout the island over Taiwan's grave economic distress. The problem? Taiwan's economy is mired in success, generating so much wealth from exports - mostly to America - that no one knows what to do with the cash. That is creating financial and political difficulties that might seem humorous from afar but that are taken very seriously here. So seriously that the Government is loosening its strict currency controls to allow the private sector access to some of its foreign-cash hoard. The nation's huge foreign-exchange reserves, accumulating at a rate of more than $1 billion a month, are at the center of the Worrisome Financial Situation."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Governor Cuomo, responding to widespread confusion over the new Federal immigration law, has formed a special panel to inform New Yorkers about the legislation and protect them from discrimination.

Is this surcharge allowed? . . . F. K., Flushing, Queens Answer: In your case it may not be. Eric Weinstock, a spokesman for the Rent Guidelines Board, said such an increase is not a surcharge but a supplementary adjustment and it was approved by the board's Order 18. That order allows landlords of apartments that rent for less than $350 a month to raise the rent up to $15 a month beyond the guideline increase upon renewal of any lease that expires between last Oct. 1 and Sept. 30, 1987. If your current rent is more than $350, the adjustment is not allowable and you should point this out to your landlord. Even if it is less than $350, your landlord may not be eligible to collect the full $15 because the new rent, including the adjustment, may not exceed $371 for a one-year renewal lease or $381.50 for a two-year renewal."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"LEONARD GORDON recently spotted an artistic rendering of Dizzie Gillespie that transfixed him. It looked like a photograph, but it had certain uncanny, eye-catching qualities that photography cannot produce. Remarkably, it existed in three dimensions, with Mr. Gillespie's bloated cheeks and upturned trumpet hovering in midair. And even more surprising, when Mr. Gordon side-stepped to view the image from another angle, it changed. The trumpeter now held his instrument away from his mouth, his cheeks were deflated, and a wide smile swept his face. ''Astonishing,'' Mr. Gordon blurted. ''I don't understand the technology, but the final product is amazing.''"

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"HUSTLE and bustle are integral components of New York's charm. The throngs surging out of the subways each morning in midtown Manhattan attest to the city's vitality, as do the crowds that pour into the South Street Seaport at lunchtime and the holiday shoppers who filled Fifth Avenue and Herald Square last week. In recent years, though, some New Yorkers have begun to wonder if they might have too much of a good thing. At the most congested intersection on Fifth Avenue, at 47th Street, as many as 12,000 pedestrians pass in an hour, according to a 1982 study by the City Planning Department. By comparison, the study said, people walk through the busiest intersections of large cities such as Chicago and Toronto at a rate of 4,000 to 6,000 an hour. And the peak sidewalk volume on the main downtown thoroughfares of San Francisco and Seattle - 1,500 to 3,000 people an hour - is roughly equal to that on many side streets in Manhattan."

Plouffe, a 16-year-old junior from Coventry, R.I. - was over in seconds when Mr. Plouffe threw her to the mat and, after a moment or two of tangled limbs and taut muscles, pinned her shoulders. But Mr. Plouffe, who last year placed second in a 32-state regional competition in his 98-pound weight class, praised his opponent, who many officials believe to be the first girl to wrestle on a boys team in New England. 'She's Really Good' ''She's really good, she knows the moves,'' he said, ''I think she should have the right to wrestle. She'll do really well.''"

Mark Russell, the comedian, thinks it is a joke. Those three observers of the bureaucracy and others addressed a special commission's proposal, presented to President Reagan last week, to increase the salaries of members of Congress, Federal judges and high officials of the executive branch, in some cases by more than 80 percent. Under the new pay scale 3,037 top Federal officials would receive salaries of more than $100,000. Except for the President, whose $200,000 salary is set by special Federal law, only the Vice President, the Speaker of the House and the Chief Justice earn that much now. (Their salaries are $100,800, $100,800 and $111,700 respectively; under the proposal each would earn $175,000.) The $135,000 recommended for members of Congress, who would otherwise get $77,400 next year, pales in comparison to the estimated $1.9 million a year in salary, bonuses, cost-of-living adjustments and deferred payments received by Dave Winfield, the Yankee slugger."

It's not that he thinks living in Frenchboro on Outer Long Island, seven and a half miles from the mainland, is anything less than glorious. It's just that he wants people to be realistic, for Mr. Blaszczuk is not a travel agent trying to book tours to Frenchboro. He is looking for permanent residents. The population of this quaint fishing village has been dwindling since 1910, when 197 people lived here.

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"''The Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting 1890-1985'' surveys a great adventure. At a time when a new generation of abstract artists experiences the grids of Mondrian not as spiritual threshholds but as prison bars, the exhibition reminds us what was at stake when a handful of artists in different parts of Europe first painted without reference to the external world. It helps us measure the leap they made and understand the doubt - and assurance - that was required to make it. The exhibition inaugurates the Robert O. Anderson Building of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and suggests the path this expanding museum hopes to pursue. It wants to be inclusive. It is concerned with East and West, with East Coast and West Coast, with modern and anti-modern, and it is looking for subjects, like this one, that will make bridges possible. ''The Spiritual in Art'' is also a direct challenge to the picture of modernism that has been painted by the Museum of Modern Art. This large show pays almost no attention to the Cezanne-Picasso-Matisse axis around which much of the permanent installation of the Modern now revolves. It has little or no interest in art-historial questions of who came first, or who influenced whom."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"TODAY, President Reagan and Jimmy Carter might find it difficult to recognize Charlotte Street, where each made a campaign stop and pledged to do something about the deterioration exemplified by the blighted Bronx thoroughfare's abandoned tenements and littered lots. Now, more than a decade after the first Presidential campaign visit - and promises that fell victim to budget cuts - local citizens have taken redevelopment into their own hands and a transformation is taking shape. Charlotte Street, abloom with ranch houses, looks like a suburban tract under construction. ''We're coming up with plans that make things work instead of doing tours and showing foreigners the worst urban blight in the country,'' said Genevieve Brooks, director of MBD Community Housing Corporation, one of the groups working to rehabilitate the Charlotte Street area."

The two teams finished regulation tied at 55-55 and were even at 59-59 with 2 minutes 40 seconds left before Ferrell took over, hitting twice while Tech's defense shut down the Eagles."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"DURING THE 10-YEAR period (1966-76) known as The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, education in China came to a standstill. Schools closed down, teachers were persecuted and students made revolution in the streets. In the last decade, with the death of Chairman Mao Zedong and the ascension to power of Deng Xiaoping, much of the madness has subsided. On the educational front, schools are open again, teachers command respect, students struggle to pass the college entrance examinations. And as part of Deng's policy of pursuing modernization and ''opening up'' China to the West, foreign teachers have been allowed to live and work there. From August 1982 to July 1984, I was one of them."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"What began as a civilized discourse in the 18th century and became a vehicle for Romantic individuality in the 19th has taken on a political tone in our own age. Our subject is, of course, the solo concerto, with its dual themes of ''the one with the many'' and ''the one against the many.'' It is particularly interesting to watch the Russian piano concerto's gradual transformation into Soviet terms. The process is not an unnatural one, for what better way to celebrate individual and collective heroism over the threatening forces of chaos than one musician's virtuoso outpourings set against a panoramic instrumental background? Struggle is native to the concerto format, so why not political struggle - where the individual tames the inchoate mob and leads it to crashing major-triad victory."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"THE debate on the hastily enacted Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 has seldom addressed one of the key immigration questions: What is the effect of immigration policy on the job skills of immigrants to the United States? Under our present, nepotistic policy, the workplace ''quality'' of immigrants is declining steadily, putting strong pressures on our already strained welfare system. Obviously, no one wants to return to the racist policies enacted in the 20's, and I want to emphasize strongly that talking about quality is not a racist smokescreen. What we need is a policy that encourages admission of immigrants from anywhere in the world who have the skills to prosper in a post-industrial society. Immigration quality refers to the myriad of skills, entrepreneurship, ambition and motivation embodied in the immigrants. The question of quality is important because immigrants receive wages and salaries in accordance with their productivity. In an earlier era, when there was little government obligation to the poor, there was little concern for skills. Today, with an elaborate income transfer (or welfare) system providing benefits not only for the aged, disabled and single parent families but also for the ''working poor,'' we cannot be so cavalier about skills."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"It's about time. Breakfast is finally making a comeback. While the revolution in American cooking swept into kitchens all over the country, transforming dinner and lunch menus, nobody had time to consider the first meal of the day. The restaurant breakfast just continued on its stodgy way. Glitzy brunch got all the press, but take away the bloody mary, and it's breakfast as usual: homestyle fries dumped straight from the freezer bag onto the hot griddle, rubbery scrambled eggs and throwaway toast. That is, until a few San Francisco Bay Area chefs stepped into the arena and began giving the great American breakfast the attention it deserves. And in true Bay Area fashion, where chefs are used to going it alone and forging new territory, each of these revival breakfasts is very different. Whatever the style - American country, uptown haute, le French cafe or retro diner - this is the real stuff: fresh eggs, baked-to-order biscuits, yeast-raised waffles or buckwheat crepes, country hams and apple-smoked bacon, jams and warm fruit crumble. There's something to please everyone from the early morning chirpers to the languid late-to-rise."

''Like everybody else, I wanted to get my act together after the game in Philly,'' said the Islanders' Brent Sutter, who had his first hat trick of the season. ''I was ready to play.'' It was obvious from the outset that the Islanders were eager to erase the memory of the 9-4 defeat in Philadelphia Thursday night. Except for the early stages of the second period, when the Rangers were the aggressors and were often in Islander territory, the Islanders were the better team, limiting the Rangers to 17 shots against Kelly Hrudey."

Her careful, early-19th-century penmanship preserved it as the great English Romantic's first extant poem, presented last week -among about 8,000 manuscripts, 13,000 printed volumes and other documents in the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer ''Shelley and His Circle'' collection - to the New York Public Library."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"MOST of us - about 70 percent - live and work on Long Island. That's because there are more opportunities here than ever before. Unemployment is at a record low and job growth is phenomenal. In the first half of this decade, Long Island gained 174,000 jobs, a 19.3 percent increase. According to the United States Department of Labor, the Island had the third largest employment growth in the nation, exceeded only by the Sun Belt cities of Dallas and Atlanta. And that trend is continuing. During the first half of 1986, 22,000 new jobs were created here. Compare that to a slight statewide decrease in jobs in the same six months, and you'll see that Long Island is the economic jewel of the state."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"IF the first two weeks of December are among the busiest on the county's cultural calendar, the rest of the month usually turns silent, with only Christmas church services carrying forward the musical torch. This year, however, we find the holiday bracketed by Sunday concerts, with a run of ''Nutcracker'' ballets into the bargain next weekend. The first two events are today: a 2:30 P.M. recital at the New Rochelle Public Library, and an orchestral program in Scarsdale at 8. The library concert is not part of the popular ''Music, Wine and Cheese'' series, so don't expect any wine or cheese, but admission-free music there will be, as Rowena Arietta, a 22-year-old pianist from the Philippines, plays works of Soler, Beethoven, Chopin, Prokofiev, Scriabin, Ravel and Albeniz. Miss Arietta, now a scholarship student at the Manhattan School, was a laureate at the 1982 Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, and this year won two other international contests, the Jose Iturbi in Spain and the Piano Teachers Congress in New York City.

Although the Warm Springs hydroelectric plant at the site does not break any record for the power it produces, it represents a milestone for its owners. Unlike any other hydroelectric plant in the United States, the plant is jointly owned by a utility company and a group of American Indian tribes. In Oregon, Maine, Arizona, Mississippi and in the West, Indian tribes in the last year have acquired local companies and experimented with joint ventures and other investments they once shied away from. In many cases, those ventures have stimulated the economy on and around the tribes' reservations and turned impressive profits."

Like those subliminal messages that appear on the screen without our realization, life breaks through the routine of our perceptions and bestows not a subconscious command, but a ''vision,'' a touch of beauty, an experience of reality beyond reality. At mass, Cathy and I had just returned to the pew after the reception of communion from which our 3-year-old, Tim, is barred by age. He had walked up to the priest with us and, of course, returned without the reception of the breaded host, the meaning of which he is deemed incapable of grasping."

Two days later, half the city was engulfed in rioting, looting and burning in the most gruesome outburst of violence among ethnic minorities here since the Hindu-Moslem clashes before independence and the separation from India in 1947. As military and civilian authorities struggled to regain control, all of Pakistan was shaken by the implications of the riots. The violence represented the coming together of Pakistan's three most pressing problems: ethnic tensions, the debilitating effects of the seven-year-old war in neighboring Afghanistan and a fundamentally weak, corrupt and polarized political system."

Manning and Richard C. Williams, were guilty. Lieut. Lorenzo V. Hillman, former head of the state police ballistics laboratory, testified this week that microscopic comparison of markings showed that bullets that killed the trooper, Philip J.

Though the police responded to reports of trouble at the scenes of both beatings, which occurred 10 blocks apart, they had believed the reports were unfounded until they discovered the man with his skull crushed and a companion wandering nearby dazed and bruised. The dead man, Michael Griffith, of 1650 Pacific Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, was found shortly after 1 A.M. lying on the Shore Parkway at Cross Bay Boulevard. He had been struck by a car whose driver, the son of a New York City police officer whose name was not released, apparently had no connection to the assailants, the police said. 'You Don't Belong Here' When he was struck, Mr. Griffith was fleeing from the beatings - one outside a pizza parlor on Cross Bay Boulevard at 157th Avenue and another at 158th Avenue and 84th Street - by a gang who accosted the black men after their car had broken down."

The central character in this novel of ghetto life in 1930's Harlem is 12-year-old Francie Coffin, whose out-of-work father runs numbers to support his family. Francie is ''a remarkable heroine'' and her father ''becomes, with Louise Meriwether's skillful handling, a figure of heroic proportions,'' Paule Marshall said in The Book Review in 1970. ''The novel's greatest achievement lies in the strong sense of black life that it conveys; the vitality and force behind the despair.'' AN OMELETTE AND A GLASS OF WINE, by Elizabeth David. (Penguin, $8.95.) The English author Eliza-beth David is believed by many to be the most impor tant living writer on food, our reviewer, Charles Rosen, said last year. Her position, he added, is confirmed with the appearance of this collection of her food writing over the previous 35 years. While her style is ''serviceable, plain and a little brusque,'' he said, she is ''a writer of pastoral . . . a literary form that evokes a golden age, a time when life was uncomplicated and pleasures were simple. . . . Books like Elizabeth David's are the last gasp of the Romantic movement.'' THE FAT WOMAN'S JOKE, by Fay Weldon. (Academy Chicago, $5.95.) Betrayed by her husband, diet-conscious Esther Wells retreats to a basement hideaway and goes on an eating binge in Fay Weldon's novel of mid-1960's English domestic life.

Yet the prospect of viewing America's last frontier from the luxury of a cruise ship or the safety of a tour bus struck all three of us as incongruous. Was there a middle way? If so, we would settle without apology for a 5. This premise having been agreed upon six months earlier, my husband, our friend and I waited at the Seattle dock of the Alaska Marine Highway for one of its ferries, popularly known as big, blue canoes, to load 17 semitrucks, a long line of smaller trucks, recreational vehicles, campers and boats; 30 or so backpackers lugging bedrolls, bicycles, guitars, grocery sacks, fishing rods and coolers; a few woodsy types returning to the wilderness; several military families taking the scenic route to base, and assorted, slightly unconventional tourists."

Democratic legislators sought a sharper reduction, saying 400 positions should be eliminated, while other groups sought similarly deep cuts. The recommendations were directed at unfilled but financed positions, estimated at 700 to 1,000 in a work force of nearly 8,500, that the county government maintains to provide a source of cash for unexpected expenses. These vacancies, called a ''phantom army'' by detractors of the accounting practice, have become the subject of acrimonious debate this year, with the controversy likely to extend well into 1987, an election year for all 17 members of the county legislature. Harvey Bennett of Bennett, Kielson & Company, the county's auditors, said 923 county jobs were unfilled as of Nov. 15, a figure that he termed ''substantially higher than previous years'' and one that represented a surplus of $20 million."

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Since returning New York State's income tax windfall as a result of Federal tax reform ought to be a priority of the newly elected State Legislature, I am encouraged that Assembly Ways and Means Committee Chairman Arthur J. Kremer [ ''New York Needs Tax Reform, Too,'' Opinion Page, Nov. 9 ] included a sales tax rate reduction among the options to return the windfall. In 1985 I strongly advocated the elimination of sales taxes on clothing costing less than $50, a proposal to benefit lower- and middle-income families. The decision not to retain deductibility of state and local taxes affords an opportunity to go further and benefit all New Yorkers. The Federal income tax changes will result in a $2.5 billion windfall to the state and a $300 million windfall to New York City, according to the most liberal estimates, unless they lower their rates. Federal tax code changes - such as eliminating the sales tax deduction, limiting individual retirement accounts, repealing the two-earner deduction for married couples and increasing the deductible for medical expenses from 5 to 7.5 percent - will result in higher taxable income for state and city, as well as Federal, purposes."

This could explain the conflicting testimony from Robert C. McFarlane, the former national security adviser, and Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, over whether the President approved the shipment. A spokesman for Mr. Meese said the member of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative George Brown, misrepresented what the Attorney General had said, but he did not elaborate. [ Page 20. ] Senator Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader and expected candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, said President Reagan still had not convinced Americans that he has done everything he can to uncover the truth about secret United States arms sales to Iran. Senator Dole said in an interview that the President had told him, ''People like me, but they don't believe me.''

1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"For the last three weeks, Canadian newspapers have focused on two dominant stories: the Reagan Administration's secret arms sales to Iran and a domestic battle over Sunday shopping. The struggle at home was settled, at least temporarily, when the Supreme Court of Canada ruled Thursday in favor of an Ontario law requiring most retailers to close Sunday. But underlying issues, arousing strong feelings among religious, labor and business groups, remain to hound politicians. At immediate issue was the disposition of 4,000 cases pending in Ontario courts against retailers who have chosen to defy the Sunday closing law. But political analysts have cast the matter against a backdrop of a nation adjusting, sometimes reluctantly, to its own evolution from an inherently conservative and Christian society to something more complex."

While the actions were long anticipated, they were more sweeping than many analysts expected."

IN her new novel, Pat Barker is concerned with two kinds of death - the transient one-time-only death of the flesh, and the living death of long-term unemployment. Her setting, as in her first two novels, ''Union Street'' and ''Blow Your House Down,'' is along working-class streets in the north of England. But she is no provincial writer working in a narrow or marginal genre. Her vision is worldly and in the grand tradition of political fiction that she has entered so ambitiously."
1986-12-21T00:00:00Z,"NOT long ago, like hundreds of other working people I participated in a ritual that is annually re-enacted by businesses around the nation: the office party. Since my athletic ineptitude rendered me incapable of participating actively in the softball game that opened the proceedings, from my lonely position in right field I had an opportunity to reflect upon the nature of the festivity. On the surface of things, the activity seemed harmless enough: an occasion characterized by the easing of the regulations and restrictions that normally govern the office environment; a day in which a sense of equality is fostered, when the boundaries that sustain the office hierarchy become blurred and the distance that normally separates employers from employees is abolished. Nevertheless, as the afternoon advanced, I began to perceive that the office party serves also a more complex purpose."

Ross Jones, the 44-year-old head millwright at the sawmill, which was built in 1922 in the mountains of the Columbia River Gorge. Mr. Jones, who has worked for Broughton's for 18 years and in mills since he was 16, is one of 105 loggers and millworkers who are losing their jobs."

''I'm a second-year medical student at Harvard, and if it's O.K. with you, I'd like to interview you before the doctor sees you.'' The man was suffering from a dull ache in his back that was keeping him from his engineering job; one doctor had diagnosed the problem as a herniated disk, and had recommended surgery. The engineer wanted a second opinion. Although Mr. Gillette asked several questions about his specific symptoms, he focused more on the patient's life at home and on the job. ''I haven't slept in my bed for several days,'' the engineer told the Harvard student. ''I've been sleeping in a recliner chair in the living room.'' As he talked, the man seemed unaware of his role in Michael Gillette's unusual medical education."

A smooth concrete walk slices through the lawn to the front door, and inside, Christmas ornaments hang from the branches of an evergreen and stockings dangle from a railing.

The Cardinal's visit to Israel, his first since assuming the leadership of the Archdiocese of New York in January 1984, was arranged after a personal invitation last September by Shimon Peres, then Prime Minister and now Foreign Minister of Israel.

And when snow did come you had to make the most of it because in less than a week the wind would back from northwest to southwest. And even if it didn't rain the ocean's warm breath would set the trees dripping, and the tracks of rabbits weaving through thickets of scrub oaks would turn to pools of water on sodden leaves. For those who wanted snow, the weather was perverse. Often after a three-day thaw had done its work, the skies would clear and there would be a time of bitter cold when ice would form in the salt pond until the only open water was at the mouth of its largest feeder brook - an ever-shrinking haven for ducks and geese, beside which Beany and I made a hunting camp from the crate in which my aunt's Christmas piano arrived."

A panel Mayor Koch named in February to propose people for jobs on nine city boards and commissions, like the Planning and Tax Commissions, found it needed help, especially in developing a pool of women and minorities. So the panel's chairman, Floyd Abrams, spoke to Patrick F. X. Mulhearn, the Mayor's counsel. Mr. Mulhearn spoke to Mr. Koch.

In quick succession, President Reagan has urged the naming of an independent counsel, conceded that mistakes had been made in carrying out his policy, announced that he would permit his aides to testify before Congress and urged that Congress grant immunity to recalcitrant witnesses. Nothing has worked, in the sense that none of Mr. Reagan's gestures have stilled the storms of controversy. The situation is still as the President described it recently to Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, ''People like me, but they don't believe me.'' Now, key White House staff members said this weekend, Mr. Reagan's inclination is to do nothing for a couple of weeks -until Congress reconvenes Jan. 6 - in the hope that silence will prove palliative.

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"The initial Congressional investigations into the Iran arms sales are about to end, but many central questions seem certain to remain unanswered for weeks, at least. The uncertainty is likely to delay foreign-policy making throughout the Government and complicate foreign relations, Congressional and Administration officials said this weekend. The independent counsel, Lawrence E. Walsh, is only beginning to organize his staff for his investigation into the Iran operation and the diversion of funds to Nicaraguan rebels. The Senate and House select committees, which begin work next month, are due to hold hearings that could last for months. As a result, the normal running of the Government is expected to be severely constrained."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Sadanori Yamanaka, not a household name even in Japan, suddenly became one of the country's most influential politicians this month. Mr. Yamanaka headed a committee of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party that two weeks ago proposed the most sweeping tax revisions for Japan since the end of World War II. They amounted to a junior version of the changes adopted in the United States this year, and, as such, attracted considerable attention both here and overseas. A few weeks earlier, a parallel Government committee had also studied the tax system and announced its proposals. While its opinions were hardly insignificant, they drew far less interest. There was never a question that the Yamanaka panel was the dominant force and would have the final word on which specific proposals were to underlie the critical policy debate that is now under way."

Wintrobe, who invented methods of identifying blood disorders that led to improved treatment of anemia, died of heart failure on Dec. 9 at his home in Salt Lake City. He was 85 years old. Dr. Wintrobe, who in 1942 wrote a major textbook on blood and its diseases, trained dozens of the country's leading specialists in the field. He codified the methods of measuring blood and invented a device to quantify the number and concentration of red blood cells. That device, the hematocrit, allows physicians to diagnose and treat different kinds of anemia."

''Our equity market appears cheaper than some markets abroad,'' said Klaus Hedbabny, a managing director of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc., in citing one reason for the appeal of United States stocks.

Another big seller is the Baby Jogger stroller (''An extra-tall model is available for those over 6-foot-3''), and sets of Magnetic Blocks are moving briskly (''If they were on your desk, you'd feel compelled to play with them''). Dinosaur books are popular, as is the fold-out children's book ''Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me.''

Staged by Michael Vernon, the ballet was a dream, with well-schooled, lively dancing, an amazing variety of stage effects for a small touring production and inventive bits of dramatic business that for the most part make this holiday classic even more believable. Mr. Vernon has continued to tinker with the ballet, set to the familiar Tchaikovsky score, since it was seen last year at Lehman Center. But it is still a version that does honor to the ballet."

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"DWIGHT GOODEN may not think so, but he was lucky four different ways in his incident with the Tampa police a week ago Saturday night. 1. He was lucky he was not more seriously injured in a brawl that may have developed racial overtones at some point. 2. He was lucky he is a prominent athlete who can gain a settlement convenient to all. 3. He was also lucky he was not tested for alcohol on the scene, given the .111 level of his blood system in a subsequent hospital test. 4. Since his alcohol level was probably higher at the time of the brawl, he may even be lucky he didn't kill anybody while he was driving. Harsh? Maybe, but there are a lot of people mourning loved ones because somebody could manage to insert a key into the ignition after ingesting some alcohol. As a colleague of mine, who lost a child to a drunk driver, puts it: ''All those beer commercials during sports events, showing men driving to a bar. What do they do with all their cars after they drink? Or, are these sleep-in bars?''"

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Reduced output of crude oil by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries during the first six months of next year is likely to raise oil prices from current levels, but not to OPEC's stated target of $18 a barrel, in the view of many oil specialists in the United States. They said that the agreement by all OPEC members except Iraq to reduce their oil production by 7 percent during the first half of 1987 was too ''modest'' to support OPEC's price goal. Further, they said, OPEC has yet to get members to adhere to the fixed prices set for its various grades of crude oil, which the analysts said is essential to insuring that the $18 price will hold. Scenarios for Rise However, other oil specialists said that prices for OPEC oil could reach $18 a barrel, but offered different reasons why it would."

Kenneth Leona delivered his homily, an unsparing message about racial prejudice and violence. ''Many people ask a priest: 'Is this a sin? Is that a sin?' '' said Father Leona, who jolted his parishioners with blunt references to a racial attack in the area early Saturday that left a young black man, 23-year-old Michael Griffith of Brooklyn, dead. ''Well, racial prejudice is a sin. Discrimination is a sin. Violence and hatred are sins. And all the beautiful Christmas lights of our neighborhood cannot hide that type of darkness.'' ''The reality of sin and evil has shown forth in our own neighborhood,'' Father Leona continued, as weak sunshine spilled through the stained-glass windows. ''But there is more to our neighborhood than that, and we must show that 'more.' ''"

From ''Pretty in Pink'' in February to ''Top Gun,'' '' 'Crocodile' Dundee,'' ''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' and this month's ''The Golden Child,'' starring Eddie Murphy, Paramount has produced an almost unbroken string of hits. So far this year, its films are expected to account for as much as 21 percent of the industry's total box office gross, pulling in about $600 million, twice as much as its nearest competitors. In the history of the film business, that is an extraordinary gap. ''The studio will end up with a huge chunk of the top 10 films of the year,'' said Art Murphy, the film industry expert for Variety, the trade newspaper."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Nigeria, once a proud symbol of oil wealth, has in recent weeks won approval of key elements of a complex package to reschedule its crushing foreign debt. Much of the $20 billion in debt was incurred in the early 1980's, after economists predicted that the $26 billion Nigeria earned from oil in 1980 would swell to $40 billion in 1986. But oil revenues, which account for almost all of the country's export earnings, were crippled when world prices plummeted and are expected to amount to just $5 billion this year. Now, encouraged by the Government's year-old austerity program, foreign banks and creditor organizations are beginning to reach agreements designed to ease the country's financial woes. Those accords include the following: * Last month, Nigeria negotiated a preliminary agreement with a group of the country's commercial bank creditors to reschedule $1.5 billion in debt.

Steven Roth, a 28-year-old television makeup artist, was found guilty of assault Saturday night in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"THE life story of Fanny Mendelssohn, whose ''Oratorio on Biblical Themes'' was given its first American performance by the St. Cecilia Chorus Saturday at Carnegie Hall, is happy with a deep sharp strain of sadness. Like her famous brother, Felix, she was trained in music from an early age, and like him she composed throughout her short life; some 500 of her works are extant. Despite the conventions of her time, she aspired to combine motherhood with a public career as a composer. Her brother, while maintaining close relations and protesting concern for her wifely nature, played a cruel role in the frustration of her wish by refusing his endorsement at a critical juncture (though he had condescended to publish some of her songs, under his name, several years earlier)."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"The United States has already paid a heavy price for its scandalous weapons sales to Iran. Yet if some of the sweeping arms proposals put forth last October at Reykjavik - which remain on the table at Geneva - are ever accepted, the damage to vital American interests will immeasurably eclipse even the most harmful consequences of the Iran affair. Realistic and verifiable agreements substantially reducing the nuclear stockpiles of the two superpowers remain highly desirable. But the proposals advanced in Iceland were not only unrealistic and unverifiable but undesirable as well. From the American point of view, Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal to abolish all nuclear weapons is the strategic equivalent of the apple Eve offered Adam. It is a tempting offer but one fraught with catastrophic consequences. In the first place, such a proposal is inherently unverifiable. Mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles can be hidden in garages or caves. Weapon components can be manufactured and maintained separately, to be assembled in a time of crisis. In an open society such as ours cheating is almost impossible, but in the closed Soviet society, violations of treaty-imposed restrictions would be considerably more difficult to detect."

Saturday in Yonkers, Arsdley and Eastchester was a result of blasting at a construction site here.

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"The Internal Revenue Service, contending that at least 1.1 million Americans have failed to provide their financial institutions with accurate Social Security numbers, has begun a tough enforcement program to combat the problem. The I.R.S. believes that problem of inaccurate or missing numbers reflects, at least partly, attempts by individuals to underreport dividend and interest income. Some tax experts say that 1.1 million is a conservative figure and that the real number is many times that. Whatever the magnitude of the problem, the I.R.S. is fighting back. According to top tax accountants, the agency recently sent letters to 23,000 financial institutions - banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions and brokerages - informing them that in at least 50 instances each, customers had failed to provide the financial institution with a Social Security number or had provided an incorrect one."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"On Dec. 31, 1987, the last remnants of a measurement system that used an astronomical device in Greenwich, England, as a reference for determining longitudes will be abolished. The traditional system, which defined latitude in terms of the poles and calculated time according to the earth's rotation, is not accurate enough to suit the needs of modern science. New techniques, based on ''landmarks'' in the sky, have made it possible to measure variations in the earth's spin, shape and geography with far greater precision than before. Some are already in use by agencies like the National Geodetic Survey of the United States. Sailors navigating the seas and travelers setting their watches will notice no difference when the new systems go into effect, for the bases of measurement will conform as closely as possible to the existing ones."

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"The General Motors Corporation's apparent determination to cut production to meet its sagging sales rate may entail as much danger for its current and future profitability as the sales incentives the company has renounced, auto analysts contend. G. M. said last week that it would temporarily close eight plants and lay off 24,200 workers to cut output in an effort to bring its inventories more in line with sales. The cutbacks came on top of earlier moves to trim production in the face of declining sales. But analysts said late last week that the company's share of the American car market has fallen so low in the wake of the 2.9 percent financing campaign of last fall, that G. M. is in danger of falling below its break-even point if it actually attempts to match production to sales. 33% Share Not Enough ''G.

But there is no such dichotomy in ''Two,'' a new duet created by Ms. Miller and Ralph Lemon that was performed by the two on Friday night at Dance Theater Workshop's Bessie Schonberg Theater.

Mr. Murphy, who settled into the club for a three-week engagement on Tuesday, is a stubborn iconoclast who projects the risky sense of discovering for the first time the musical components and the lyrical essence of a song in the process of singing it. At Tuesday's opening-night show, Mr. Murphy, adeptly supported by the house quartet, turned a number of familiar songs into spontaneous vocal safaris that yielded idiosyncratic, sometimes exhilarating insights."

Attack on Rebel Strongholds The most recent fighting is reported to have started Saturday when, after extensive aerial bombardment, three Libyan columns of about 700 soldiers apiece attacked four mountain strongholds of guerrillas loyal to a northern chief and former President of Chad, Goukouni Oueddei."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Roughly half the young lawyers surveyed around the nation five months ago disagreed with President Reagan's contention that the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua is a threat to American national security. The 1,800 members of the American Bar Association, 35 years of age and younger, responded to a questionnaire published in July, long before the public learned that insurgents' efforts against the Sandinistas were being financed with proceeds from secret sales of arms to Iran."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"When Harvey Saligman, the chairman of Interco, announced an agreement last week to buy the Lane furniture company, he completed a corporate shopping spree. Lane is the third acquisition that Mr. Saligman, 48, has made in the last four months for Interco, the St. Louis-based furniture, footwear and retail company whose roster of brand names includes Florsheim Shoes and Broyhill furniture. In September, Interco acquired Converse, the athletic shoe company, in a $145 million deal, and the next month, it purchased Highland House, a furniture manufacturer in Lenore, N.C., for an undisclosed amount."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"After 21 seasons, the Miami Dolphins play in the Orange Bowl for the final time tonight. Their next home game is Aug. 16, 1987, when they meet Chicago in an exhibition at Dolphin Stadium, a 73,000-seat park being built with all the luxuries and conveniences by the team's owner, Joe Robbie, on his 432 acres near the line that separates Dade and Broward Counties to the north. The Dolphins leave without formal goodbyes. No ceremonies have been scheduled for tonight's game, against New England - an appropriate void, given the frequently heated nature of the squabbles between Robbie and the city over the lack of luxury boxes at the municipally owned stadium and its generally sad appearance."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"The Nicaraguan armed forces have just completed three days of large-scale military maneuvers in this remote region bordering Honduras, From the Nicaraguan briefings and the way the exercise was conducted, it was clear the Sandinistas wanted to demonstrate that although their army has shortcomings, it is rapidly improving and capable of fighting more than a counterinsurgency war against the contras in the forested mountains of Nicaragua. In the largest Sandinista maneuvers ever held in the region, a total of 6,500 Nicaraguan soldiers and airmen conducted a mock war with live ammunition. Military attaches accredited to Nicaragua and invited members of the press were trucked to the area to observe the last day of the exercise. Somotillo is in Chinandega Department in northwest Nicaragua, 155 miles from Managua, the capital. The Pan-American Highway passes from Honduras into Nicaragua over a bridge at Somotillo, but the bridge is down and the border is closed at that point."

He has resolved labor disputes involving shipbuilders, teachers, pilots, bus drivers, postal employees and iron and steel workers, among others. Now, Mr. Garrett, who is 75 years old, has been called in to mediate in the labor dispute between the USX Corporation and the United Steelworkers union. The dispute is nearly five months old and is the longest work stoppage in the history of the American steel industry."

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Pedro Gil, a 50-year-old electrician with two grown sons, sat by the Christmas tree in the living room of his modest red-tile-roofed home here today, talking about the three and a half years he spent as a combat adviser to rebel soldiers in southern Nicaragua. He shifted on the couch and pulled up his shirt to show a three-inch welt where he said he had been grazed by a Nicaraguan Government soldier's bullet. He had bled a lot, he said, but he kept firing his American-made M-16 rifle on full automatic. A moment earlier, another bullet had knocked him off his feet, he said, but had lodged in an ammunition pouch on his thigh. When the shooting stopped, Mr. Gil said, 11 Government soldiers lay dead. He did not know if he had shot any of them, he said, but he had fired seven magazines of 30 shots each, 210 rounds altogether."

We talked about it over the weekend and he doesn't like any part of the way he's treated and he's not going back.''"

Instead of, as is customary, qualifying about half of the original field for the final, only pairs who had topped their sections during the afternoon were able to advance. The winners of the super final, whose excitement was heightened by the use of barometer scoring, and therefore results round by round, were Steve Adumkin and Linda Danas, both of Manhattan."

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Almost imperceptibly, below the blank stone gaze of Table Mountain, a train pulls out of Cape Town every other day, offering its passengers a luxury from the past that seems to contrast with the sadnesses of the present in the land it traverses. For the last 40 years the Blue Train, successor to older African expresses that once spanned the empire of Cecil John Rhodes, has made its way between Cape Town and Johannesburg, a distance of 895 miles. A plane takes roughly an hour and 50 minutes to make the journey. The Blue Train, leisurely and matronly, takes a day, an express defined more by the pace of slower trains on the route than by any great proclivity for speed."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"One pilot was killed and a second escaped uninjured yesterday when their small, single-engine airplanes collided 300 feet over Kingston-Ulster Airport in upstate New York, the police and the airport manager said. The accident occurred at 10:05 A.M. as an airplane taking off struck the underside of a second aircraft that was landing."

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"When Mikhail S. Gorbachev called for more openness in Soviet society and signaled greater freedom for the arts, the response was heady. Poets and playwrights scrambled to assault bureaucratism, publishers searched for novels to rehabilitate, and film makers purged the old-guard leadership of their union and scoured the censors' shelves for movies to release. Newspapers printed candid exposes of national ills, and the staid state television weighed in with daring interviews. The clamor to climb on the bandwagon now generates almost daily sensations. A recent exhibition entitled ''Masters of Culture for Peace,'' the sort that used to be patronized only by delegations of aspiring Communists, became the hot running event in town with hard-rock concerts, spontaneous debates and multimedia happenings."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"''THE Christmas Revels,'' an always merry production that mixes music and dance, harking back to ancient solstice celebrations, returned for its annual visit to the Symphony Space this weekend. The new edition had a French theme - incorporating church music, medieval and Renaissance carols as well as stately dances described in a well-known 16th-century treatise by the French clergyman Thoinot Arbeau. The rest of the program, on Saturday afternoon, retained the old British mummers' plays and ritual country dances related to the death of winter and to rebirth that are at the core of every ''Revels'' show. The ingenuity with which this framework is stretched and adapted to other national Yuletide customs from year to year constitutes one of the many delights of the ''Revels.''"
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Surgeons implanted an artificial heart into an unidentified patient over the weekend and were searching for a human heart donor, a hospital spokesman said today. It was the 10th artificial heart to be implanted at Presbyterian-University Hospital in Pittsburgh as a temporary, lifesaving device. The Jarvik-70 heart, a scaled-down version of the Jarvik-7, was implanted in a six-hour procedure, said the spokesman, Chris Shirer, who added that the patient was in critical condition."

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Faced with the desperate need to start winning with the playoffs looming, the Jets instead collapsed offensively and defensively today, ending the regular season with their fifth straight loss. The beneficiaries of the collapse were the Bengals, whose 52-21 victory produced the highest number of net yards, 621, ever generated against the Jets, whose late-season collapse must rank with the great folds in National Football League history. The Jets weren't that concerned with winning today. They just wanted to look good. They did neither."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"THERE is ample confusion in the conception of James Simpson's production of ''The Merchant of Venice,'' but there should be no mistaking the locale. The evening at the Classic Stage Company begins with a gondola, or rather, with a raft standing in for a gondola. Propelling the craft are Antonio's cronies, Salerio and Solanio, in this production a pair of Venetian clowns. The gondola and gondoliers reappear with such frequency that the play begins to resemble a Grand Canal version of ''Big River.'' The vessel misses only the courtroom scene, but is poled on stage for the climax as the characters - five on a raft - embark, presumably for calmer dramatic waters. As for the play, it sinks. Mr. Simpson's directorial style is eccentrically eclectic, veering from mock Peter Brook (a rug, but no magic in the carpet) to Bunraku, as represented by shrouded stagehands who scurry along at a stoop in the vaudeville manner of Rowan Atkinson. They shift chairs and tables, occasionally give a prod to a recalcitrant actor and earn unintentional laughter. There is nothing else Oriental about the production, unless one includes the odd twangs that emerge sporadically from a small combo perched over the stage."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Americans owe Uncle Sam some $250 billion under various Federal loan programs. Selling those loans to private investors is one of Washington's new tricks for reducing the budget deficit. The Government gets cash quickly and painlessly; the investor gets a discounted loan that should eventually pay off at face value and pays interest in the meantime. While there is some merit to this undertaking, it is poor deficit-reduction strategy."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,The Department of Education reported today that college enrollments rose this fall instead of dropping. Colleges have been preparing for several years for a sharp drop in enrollments as a result of a steady decline in the number of people in the age group that customarily attends college.

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Jimmy Rodgers, the Boston Celtics' director of player personnel and an assistant coach, was at the Rockford (Ill.) Metro Centre Saturday night, the final stop of an eight-day scouting trip in which he saw 11 of the 12 Continental Basketball Association teams play. But instead of watching the Rockford Lightning defeat the Savannah Spirits, Rodgers could have been coaching the Celtics in the closing minutes of their 122-100 loss to the Bucks at the Milwaukee Arena, about 100 miles away. With 7 minutes 14 seconds remaining in the final quarter, both Coach K. C. Jones and Chris Ford, his other assistant, were ejected from the game for arguing with the officials."

The announcement follows Mr. DeLorean's acquittal last week of charges that he had embezzled $8.5 million from investors in his previous enterprise. In that venture, Mr. DeLorean made a stainless-steel sports car with gull-wing doors, the DMC-12, at a plant in Northern Ireland in 1981 and 1982."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"High unemployment and falling wages were the factors most responsible for the 7 million increase in the number of poor Americans since 1979, not the rise of single-parent households, a Congressional study says. The report by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee challenges the view held by some supporters of the Reagan Administration that an increase in teen-age pregnancies and single-parent families has accounted for much of the decade's rise in poverty."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"The wave of student protests in Chinese cities in the last two weeks finds its roots in a tradition of activism, marked by street demonstrations, that ranks among modern China's most venerated forces for social change. In both style and timing, though not in stated motivation, the current protests can be traced back 51 years to a December in which students took to icy streets in Beijing and other cities to protest the spread of Japanese power. The advancing armies, the students contended, directly threatened their nation's independence. Today, according to reports from China, some of the issues that have caused student demonstrations in at least seven provinces are seemingly mundane: bad food and lighting in universities, rising school fees in one case, complaints about bureaucracy."

Ms. Sawyer has been in negotiation with CBS for weeks, and has indicated to the network that she may leave for either NBC or ABC. The three networks are vying for her with assorted packages involving more money, more air time and the potential of an anchor role."

Although no Government agency keeps definitive records, the 1986 population prize for such holiday messages would appear to go to Rep-resentative Howard C. Nielson, Republican of Utah, whose card, signed ''Howard, Julie & Family,'' shows a total of 36 people, ranging from the 62-year-old Congresman down to five babes in arms."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Representatives of Governor Cuomo and of the State Senate today supported a temporary plan that would put off for six months a decision on how to pay for rebuilding New York City's mass transit system and would freeze fares. But the Assembly Speaker, Stanley Fink, and officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority expressed reservations about the proposal, intended as a way out of a deadlocked special session of the Legislature. They said the temporary plan might be too uncertain for the M.T.A. to be able to go ahead with its rebuilding program on schedule."

Wolff, chairmen of the Committee on a National Strategy for AIDS, Institute of Medicine and National Academy of Sciences, take issue ( letter, Nov. 29) with ''Don't Panic Yet, Over AIDS'' (editorial, Nov. 7) for overemphasizing prevention focused on traditional risk groups, drug addicts in particular. They believe this is an antiquated approach to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome epidemic. The writers point to heterosexual transmission as a reason for massive public-health education."

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In your front-page article (Dec. 1) on dissent in the Roman Catholic Church, various United States bishops claim that dissatisfaction over the disciplining of Archbishop Raymond G. Hunthausen of Seattle has been magnified by the press. For example, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles says only a small fraction of the three million Catholics in his archdiocese have ''voiced concern.'' That may be so in Los Angeles, but as a priest of the Archdiocese of Seattle, I can attest it is not the case here. In practically every gathering of priests - no matter how informal -the issue inevitably surfaces. Lay people, especially our most committed church workers, continue to ask questions. In Seattle the issue will not simply go away."

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"It is called the Friday syndrome. And, last Friday, just as was the case for several weeks running, traders in the stock market hunkered down as they approached a weekend, fearing the market chaos that could ensue if the Government dropped the next shoe in the ongoing Ivan F. Boesky insider trading scandal. From midday on Thursday to the close of trading on Friday, rumors that the Government would announce new indictments or revelations of further investigations after the close of trading swirled around the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, depressing stock prices of companies already in the takeover spotlight, thus reflecting a new-found caution on Wall Street. 'Triple Witching' in Shadow And though the presence of the ''triple-witching hour'' in related stock options and futures last Friday caused a surge in prices at the close of trading, traders contended that the shadow of another Boesky-type case was paramount on everyone's minds throughout the day."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"It is not even a subway - only 150 yards or so are enclosed in a tunnel. But that did not prevent the Staten Island Rapid Transit system from doing what subways in New York seem destined to do: fall apart. The bridge carrying the railroad's two tracks over Bay Street in Clifton, having moved six and a half inches while no one was looking, is now braced with timber, awaiting permanent repairs. Floods at Richmond Valley sometimes cover the third rail, knocking out service."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Travelers during these busiest flying days of the year understand that the combination of winter weather and holiday crowds often means late departures. But what explains the delays that have become almost routine at big airports - delays that waste some 2,000 hours of airliner time a day, all year round? The 25 percent increase in late flights this year is one sign that the deregulated airline industry flourishes. Total traffic has mushroomed 60 percent since a 1978 law allowed airlines to enter new markets and cut fares. But Washington has failed to manage existing air traffic capacity efficiently, let alone expand it. Fundamental changes are needed to break the institutional gridlock."

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Uncertain that their fuel supply would last and suffering fatigue after a bruising week of nonstop flight, the crew of the experimental plane Voyager had clear weather today as they neared their craft's goal: being the first to fly around the world without stopping for fuel. With more than 21,373 miles behind them, the pilots, Richard G. Rutan and Jeana Yeager, were so tired at times that they could not provide accurate information to the mission's controllers, said the designer of the plane, Burt Rutan. The craft's fuel gauge was not giving accurate readings, opening the possibility that headwinds might leave the plane with ''barely enough to glide back to Edwards with the engine out of gas,'' said Mr. Rutan, who is the pilot's brother."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"* Remember Clifford Allen? He's the 6-foot-10-inch center who wound up as yet another unlikely prospect for Coach Jerry Tarkanian's Nevada-Las Vegas basketball team. The 18-year-old Allen, though regarded as one of the best school-age pivot men in California, has been in so much trouble for most of his life that he's managed to play only one high school game - a tournament loss last February in which he scored 32 points and grabbed 18 rebounds for the El Paso de Robles juvenile-detention center in Paso Robles."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said today that a prolonged crisis over the Iran arms deals could throw American foreign policy into confusion just as the Reagan Administration had begun to give it coherence. Mr. Lee, one of Washington's strongest supporters and oldest friends in Asia, was speaking in an interview at his official residence here on a range of topics from the future of Singapore's entrepreneurs to the promising role of China and the limited prospects for the Soviet Union in a coming ''Pacific century.'' He predicted that in the next 100 years, ''the Pacific is where all the action will be: a focal area of great advance, as the Atlantic was in the 19th and 20th centuries.'' Asked about regional perceptions of the United States, Mr. Lee, 63 years old, who has governed Singapore since it first achieved self-rule in 1959, said the projection of a clearly defined American policy to this region had been ''getting much better under six years of President Reagan, until this Iranian arms deal and the contribution from it to Nicaraguan contras.''"
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"UNFORTUNATELY for the Jets, the National Football League constitution forbids a team from trading a playoff berth. But now that the Jets have limped into the Super Bowl XXI tournament on a five-game losing streak for a 10-6 record, they would be better off trading their playoff berth to the Seattle Seahawks, who didn't qualify even though they finished at 10-6 with a five-game winning streak. The Jets' price would be an offense to be named later. Without a word or a glance, the Jets filed into their locker room at Riverfront Stadium after yesterday's 52-21 rout by the Cincinnati Bengals, but they should have stumbled in backwards. That's how they got into the playoffs."

Jack, the Harlem politician who in 1953 became the first black Borough President of Manhattan but lost office after a conflict-of-interest scandal, died Friday night at St. Luke's Hospital. Mr. Jack, who would have been 80 years old on Dec. 29, was a 45-year resident of West 110th Street. Mr. Jack, a native of the West Indies, rose to the highest administrative political office then held by a black in the United States. As a politician, he came to symbolize for many blacks an important milestone in a long struggle for political and social equality. His widening influence in the Manhattan Democratic organization earned him election to the State Assembly in 1940. Halfway into his seventh term, in 1953, he resigned after being elected to the borough presidency, to which he was re-elected for a second four-year term in 1957."

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"A CAUTIOUS Cyndi Lauper performed Friday at Madison Square Garden. Visually, she was the same madcap, flamboyant, volatile performer whose 1983 debut album, ''She's So Unusual,'' made her one of the major stars of the 1980's. She wore layers of clothes - a black velvet cape, a red tutu, a puffy-sleeved flowered top, antique lingerie with suspenders - and went through a repertory theater's-worth of facial expressions. Vocally, she delivered shouts, sighs, yelps and hiccups while in constant motion on stage."

We hear less frequently the body of music that has grown up with and around this phenomenon, a distinctive and often fascinating tradition of violin writing. It was impressively sampled by Koichiro Harada, the founder and until 1981 the first violinist of the Tokyo String Quartet, Saturday afternoon at the Asia Society."

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Indian and Pakistani officials reached an agreement today to step up coordination of their border security forces to prevent Sikh extremists from using Pakistan territory as a base for attacks in India. The agreement, reached after two days of talks, was highly limited in scope, but it nonetheless marked the first time in a year that the two nations had found common ground on any steps to reduce tensions. Relations had seriously worsened in recent months as Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India repeatedly charged that Pakistan was aiding Sikh militants. A few weeks ago, he said that India could easily send its troops into Pakistan to wipe out supposed extremist ''training camps,'' but that it had not done so because it would violate international law."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Doug Flutie threw two touchdown passes in his debut as a starter for the Chicago Bears today, and Walter Payton tied the National Football League of 106 career rushing touchdowns in a 24-10 defeat of Dallas that gave the Cowboys their first losing season in 22 years. Chicago set a record for fewest points allowed in a 16-game season with 187, breaking Pittsburgh's mark of 195 set in 1978. Payton tied Jim Brown's record for rushing touchdowns on a 1-yard plunge in the first period. The Bears, who won the National Conference Central Division title, finished the regular season with a 14-2 record. The Cowboys fell to 7-9, their worst record since they were 5-8-1 in 1964. It was Chicago's seventh consecutive victory."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"RECENTLY, the R. T. French Company of One Mustard Street in Rochester helped add spice to the life of Richard D. Thomson, president of Rumrill-Hoyt in that city, by slipping his agency a number of assignments. Although for security reasons the jobs cannot be identified at this time, Mr. Thomson in his bosom knows what they are and the knowledge warms and cheers him in those chilly northern climes. What it means is that a well-known corporate neighbor is aware of the fact that Rumrill-Hoyt, once a firmly entrenched industrial agency (now called business-to-business), has embraced a consumer goods orientation. And that's where Mr. Thomson's career roots are."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Only the playoffs will tell whether the defending Super Bowl champions can repeat, but one thing is already certain: The Chicago Bears are the gabbiest team in the land. According to statistics compiled by the National Football League, various players, coaches and officials of the 28 clubs participate in 118 regularly scheduled radio and television programs each week. Of that total, 25 are accounted for by the garrulous Bears, who have more than twice as many as their main chitchat rivals - the Washington Redskins, not surprisingly. In the nation's capital, where talk is the No. 1 pastime, the Redskins have a dozen weekly shows. (By contrast, the Giants and the Jets, who play across the river from the world's media capital, account for only four between them: two by Coach Bill Parcells of the Giants, one by his veteran linebacker, Harry Carson, and one by the Jets' public relations director, Frank Ramos.) The N.F.L. chitchat stats actually understate the league's penetration of the nation's airways, since multiple appearances, such as a radio report carried five days a week, are counted as a single program. In achieving their tongue-wagging supremacy, which gives new meaning to the nickname Windy City, the Bears demonstrate both vocal strength and depth. Coach Mike Ditka, for example, has four separate programs, and the team's broadcast roster boasts 13 players, although one is notably absent. That's William Perry, who apparently concentrates more on what goes into his mouth than on what comes out."

The Moody's rating, which is far lower than the AAA claims- paying rating assigned by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, caused yields of many bonds backed by Executive Life contracts to rise about 15 hundredths of a percentage point, according to analysts at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company."

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"It's a pleasant little room that looks out on a tranquil garden in the West Village, a place where people with AIDS can gather for food, conversation, relaxation and the sharing of information. Called the Living Room, it is run by the People With AIDS Coalition, which is operated for and by people with AIDS. And that's what makes it special. ''There are other groups for people with AIDS, but this is the only group of people with AIDS doing something for themselves,'' said Michael Hirsch, director of the coalition and its only paid employee. He and a few volunteers are the only ones of the 20 or so active members who do not have acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS-related complex. The coalition was founded 18 months ago to convince people with AIDS that they have control over their own lives. It cooperates with other social service agencies and with the National Association of People With AIDS, which was formed last March."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"For the people of New Mexico, Christmas means posole, a hominy and chili stew, and the anise-flavored cookies known as bizcochitos as well as Christmas ham and egg nog. It means both decorated trees, a legacy of northern Europe, and streets lined with paper bags aglow with small candles sunk in sand, luminarias that, according to legend, light the way for the Magi seeking the Christ child. But perhaps the most integral part of the holiday for many in New Mexico is ''Las Posadas'' - ''The Inns'' - a ritualistic verse drama that reveals both the depth of their religious feelings and the determination to keep their Iberian heritage alive and meaningful. In the days before Christmas, Hispanic New Mexicans re-enact the coming of Christ in folk dramas whose roots scholars trace to the Nativity plays of medieval and Renaissance Spain. ''Las Posadas'' was a prelude to the larger Nativity play, ''Los Pastores'' - ''The Shepherds'' - which is rarely performed today."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"The General Electric Company has agreed to provide several billion dollars to Kidder, Peabody & Company, which it acquired earlier this year, to help fund a move by the firm to invest aggressively in corporate mergers and buyouts, according to sources close to the two companies. On Friday, Kidder announced internally a reorganization of its investment banking division that sharply escalates its commitment to such merchant banking activities. The sources said that the fund, voted on by G.E.'s board late last week, would be in excess of $2 billion, and would probably grow over time. Shift in Direction These steps culminate an important shift in direction by both Kidder and G.E. It also pits them more directly against the other major players in merchant banking, which is becoming the hottest, and most competitive, area on Wall Street, even with the huge risks it involves."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"The eldest son of the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament has apparently fled to Canada ''after receiving at least $6 million'' for his role in the sale of American arms to Iran, a London newspaper reported today.

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"LIKE the commercial networks, public television this week is offering a number of holiday specials, most of them crammed with the standard collection of carols. On Christmas Eve, for instance, Shirley Verrett joins the Mormon Tabernacle Choir for a program that includes everything from ''O Holy Night'' to ''Go Tell It on the Mountain.'' That same evening, ''James Galway's Christmas Carol'' is a touch more adventurous, as the Irish flutist also explores a number of English folk and traditional melodies. But of all the special projects - some of them containing appeals to help your local public-television station -none are more thoroughly charming than ''A Ceremony of Carols,'' a choral work being broadcast tonight at 11 on Channel 13. The presentation is the second in a three-part series packaged as ''A Benjamin Britten Retrospective,'' marking the 10th anniversary of the British composer's death. The tribute began last week with a superb 1980 documentary called ''A Time There Was,'' a title taken from a folk-song suite by Britten. Directed by Tony Palmer and produced by Donald Mitchell, it traced Britten's life and work through the recollections of his family and close friends, notably the tenor Peter Pears, who lived and worked with the composer for some 40 years. Mr. Pears died last April."

During the day, crowds of students and workers in numbers approaching 50,000 flooded into People's Square in a third day of protests for broader democratic rights. The official New China News Agency, in an article issued late this evening, accused the students of beating up 31 policemen during a sit-in at City Hall, marching in ''utter disorder'' and breaking into the building housing the Shanghai People's Congress. Rumors of large-scale arrests swept through the crowds, but they could not be confirmed."

This is no doubt partly be-cause I teach at a large state university where students are not subject to a selective admissions policy; rather than being Napoleons, they are the ''Parisian working women who served on the front lines.'' Of course the very idea of the centrality of Western civilization is suspect when a large portion of the student body is Asian, as at my university.

The skit, by the No Respect for the Human Condition Players, one of a growing number of local comedy groups, in many ways is typical of the way comedians have long made fun of Philadelphia.

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Whether Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, when he was a member of the National Security Council staff, acted on his own to divert money from the Iran arms sale to assist Nicaraguan rebels intrigues several former officials and practioners of the craft of intelligence. But if Colonel North did not act on his own, these former officials and others say, they are mystified as to why his superiors apparently entrusted him with such functions as evaluating, planning, managing, financing and concealing the existence of the diversion to the contras and other covert actions. The Iran arms sale, these former officials say, reinforces old lessons about the hazards of covert intelligence actions and underlines a newer lesson about entrusting the direction and execution of secret operations to amateurs and deputized private citizens. The former officials say White House officials may have forgotten or misunderstood a series of mishaps that crippled United States intelligence circles in the 1970's. Breaking Protective Barriers Several of the former officials said one of the more obvious mistakes was a try to avoid legal and customary practices of notifying Congress of covert actions. But they said an even graver criticism would be that the laws and Presidential directives on intelligence activities enacted in the Ford and Carter Administrations, and in theory carried on by President Reagan, apparently were ignored or failed in practice."
1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Greeting cards from Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, have always said different things to different people - ''Season's Greetings'' to some, ''Meilleurs Voeux'' or ''Felices Fiestas'' to others. But according to Louis Gendron, head of Unicef's greeting card operations in the United States, to most Americans they say nothing at all. ''Most people have never heard of them,'' he said, adding: ''Sometimes they confuse Unicef with unisex. Sometimes that opens doors.'' Profits from Unicef cards, which last year totaled $22 million worldwide, were used to provide food, medicine and fresh water for children around the globe. But while the end is charity, the means are business, and so are the problems. In recent years, the greeting card operation the United States has been battered by bad management, high production costs and low visibility. Mr. Gendron, who was called out of retirement two years ago to lead the faltering operation, is trying to change this. 'Selling a Product' ''I'm not fund-raising, I'm selling a product,'' he said. ''The only difference between me and Hallmark is that my profits go to the children of the world instead of to shareholders.''"

Lewis Frumkes, writer and humorist, was quoting Ring Lardner and speculating on the intangibles in what makes for a shared sense of humor. Humor is being taken very seriously in some circles these days. Since 1974 there have been nine national conventions of people - including anthropologists and linguists -who are interested in the subject. On Apr. 1, appropriately enough, a five-day International Humor Convention, the sixth, will begin at Arizona State University. Hospitals are using laughter therapy groups with patients who have chronic pain. And on the Johnson Memorial Hospital bulletin board in Stafford Springs, Conn., an exhortation appeared: ''Jest for the Health of It.''"

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"Hopes for lower interest rates in coming months helped to insulate the note and bond markets from the sharp rise in short-term interest rates last week, but were not enough to move Treasury bond yields from about the middle of the trading range that has prevailed since April. Over the remainder of the year, analysts expect that trading will remain lethargic in the absence of any major economic announcements or sharp moves in oil prices following of Saturday's OPEC agreement to cut oil production. Late Friday, the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent bonds due in 2016 were offered at 101 5/8 to yield 7.36 percent, about the same yield as has prevailed the past two weeks. Portfolios Held Stable ''This is not the time of year for any large portfolio restructuring,'' said William B. Budd, executive vice president of Favia Hill & Associates, an investment advisory firm. Although Mr. Budd expects long bond yields to decline as economic growth remains sluggish and the Fed reduces short-term rates, he noted that trading has been so light recently that large transactions would cause disadvantageous price changes."

1986-12-22T00:00:00Z,"With the White House and Congress convulsed by the ever expanding Iran-Israel-Saudi Arabia-Canada-contra arms affair, the Supreme Court has been going about its own measured routine with stately detachment, here carving a little First Amendment hole in the campaign spending laws, there making it a bit harder for corporations to challenge mergers between their competitors. Someday the Reagan Administration turmoil may spawn a great constitutional case for the Court to resolve, like the Watergate tapes case of 1974. Meanwhile, the Justices have plenty of other work to take with them as they take a four-week holiday recess. It is too early to say how the changes in the Court's membership over the last summer will affect its work product. But some who watch it closely already say that under its new Chief Justice, William H. Rehnquist, the Court seems a more good-natured place than before."

But it said that the world population was growing more slowly than in the 1960's and 1970's. In a report made public today, the bureau estimated that Mexico's population would increase by almost 42 percent, from 79.7 million in 1985 to 112.8 million in the year 2000. Mexico City is expected to surpass Tokyo-Yokohama as the world's largest urban area in about 20 years, the study said.

The issue this time is punishment. Mrs. Harris, the 64-year-old former headmistress of the Madeira School in Virginia and now New York State prisoner 81-G-98, has written a letter to Governor Cuomo requesting clemency, which would make her eligible for immediate parole. Convicted of second-degree murder in the shooting, she is serving 15 years to life at the Bedford Hills state prison in Westchester County. The Governor has said he will give Mrs. Harris's request his ''very, very best judgment'' when it reaches his desk, but has declined to comment further. His office has declined to say when he might announce decisions about clemency. It has been a tradition in the state for the decisions to be made in the December holiday period."

But to achieve that goal, OPEC will have to display a measure of unity, production discipline and political will that the aspiring cartel has often lacked during its 26-year history. The production-cutting accord is expected to lift free-market oil prices up toward the OPEC target of $18 a barrel during the next few days, analysts say. But in the longer term, OPEC's ability to enforce fixed prices is uncertain."

The appointment last week of Richard Knight Jr. to City Manager, the top municipal job, symbolizes not only the personal evolution of one black American but also the stunning transformation of a city long dominated by a conservative white business establishment. ''This is the one city people thought this would not happen - it's a terrifically important symbolic step,'' said Lee Simpson, a former City Councilman.

''They have managed reasonably well in a difficult environment,'' said Sanford L. Margoshes, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ''They're muddling along.'' Unocal's problems started when Mr. Pickens, the chairman of the Mesa Petroleum Company, made a run at the company last year. Unocal successfully fought off his takeover attempt in May 1985, but at the cost of taking on a huge debt load - an additional $4.4 billion, bringing total debt to a peak of $5.9 billion - to buy back 40 percent of its shares at a premium. Several other concerns, including the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and CPC International Inc., have recently initiated expensive stock buyback programs in moves to fend off corporate raiders. Unocal's performance has been closely watched since the Pickens episode by those who wonder how much such companies can afford to pay for their freedom."

McFarlane delivered what he thought was a final order to the Israelis and arms dealers brokering weapons sales to Iran. By Presidential decree, Mr. McFarlane said, the weapons shipments were finished. But within six weeks, the covert operation that was to capture the imagination of key staff members at the National Security Council rose from the ashes. A senior Israeli official, Amiram Nir, came to Washington later last December with word that the Iranian middlemen had sweetened the terms. Just one more arms shipment, Mr. Nir reported, would win the release of the five American hostages in Lebanon and open ties to moderates in Teheran. President Reagan changed his mind, and the arms were sent in February. But the hostages were not released, beginning a pattern that would recur again and again."

How well they executed was more important than hours of reviewing scouting reports and game films. Or so he thought. Ten games later, and with only one victory for his efforts, Hill changed his strategy. It paid off. The Knicks played perhaps their best defense of the season last night at Madison Square Garden, and gained a much-needed 103-99 victory over the San Antonio Spurs that snapped an eight-game losing streak, their longest of the season."

The winners of the Flight B Swiss Teams were Lesley Decker of Woodbury, L.I.; Janet Schiff of Port Washington, L.I.; Jo Ann Grauerholz of Seaford, L.I., and Carol Frimet of Long Beach, L.I., tied with Robert Christman, Judith Boies, David and Nan Robinson, all of Manhattan."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"A coalition of national organizations and individuals joined today in a ''statement of principles'' calling for a major overhaul of the welfare system that would guarantee all Americans a minimum standard of living. The statement, composed over a three-month period by 20 organizations and endorsed by about 70 others, said the Federal Government had the ''primary responsibility'' for fighting poverty. Individuals joining in the call for national debate on the issue included Arthur Flemming, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare under President Eisenhower, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"John Cardinal O'Connor has urged New York City to take several dramatic steps to preserve single-room-occupany hotel rooms for low-income and homeless people, including the public acquisition of such hotels and the payment of subsidies to hotel owners who cannot stay in business. In a column in the current issue of Catholic New York, the newspaper of the Archdiocese of New York, the Cardinal notes that a moratorium banning the conversion of S.R.O. hotels and rooming houses ends Dec. 31. Current plans in the City Council, he said, call for only a one-month extension."

Although some layoffs have begun, the company said the shutdowns would occur early next year."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"A Federal district judge has set aside a jury verdict in his court against the nausea drug Bendectin, which was made by Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. The three-year-old suit charged that the drug caused birth defects in a girl who is now 10 years old. In a 14-page opinion, Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, in Washington, said that, based on the evidence presented in the trial, ''no reasonable jury could find on the basis thereof that this infant plantiff's birth defects were more likely than not to have been caused by her intrauterine exposure to Bendectin.''"
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: The Central Intelligence Agency is again recruiting potential servants of secrecy, and colleges and universities are again lending this enterprise their support and facilities; students are again protesting the use of academic facilities for nonacademic purposes. Their protests are misguided, for they tend to substitute force for reason."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"A state watchdog agency called yesterday for the abolition of New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission and said the Mayor should be ultimately responsible for regulating the taxi industry and setting rates. The agency, the State Commission of Investigation, in a report on corruption and irregularities at the Taxi Commission, asserted that the taxi panel, in its 16 years of existence, had failed to supervise the taxi industry properly. The ''bottom line indicates,'' the chairman of the Investigation Commission, David G. Trager, said at a news conference that the Taxi Commission has been ''co-opted by the industry that it was set up to regulate.'' In urging the removal of the nine-member Taxi Commission, the state body proposed that the day-to-day supervision of taxi matters be handled by a mayoral agency, the Department of Transportation."

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Vietnam's poor economic performance was the overriding concern of Hanoi's governing Communists when they assembled last week for their Sixth Party Congress. But it is not the only problem to which the country's new leaders are giving immediate attention, records of the meetings indicate. As diplomats and scholars begin to sift through voluminous speeches, articles and the comments of Vietnamese officials, they say it is apparent that the leadership faces factionalism within the party, a disgruntled army and, most important, a south that is still wayward and uncooperative. The south, in the view of some Hanoi officials, is the source of corruption, political deviation and ''many-faceted sabotage.''"
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In saying that the gods in Pretoria are crazy, your editorial speaks a truth that has long been evident and often stated. Pretoria's rejection of the ''KwaNatal option,'' Chief Buthelezi's proposal to merge the governments of Natal Province and KwaZulu, is only the latest evidence of its madness."

''I would prefer to go off and do my own thing, so to speak,'' he said. ''I didn't want to spend the rest of my life as president of a public company.''"
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"A city law that required owners of vacant single-room-occupancy hotels to rehabilitate their buildings and rent the rooms back to low-income renters was declared unconstitutional by a judge in Manhattan yesterday. The judge, Justice David B. Saxe of State Supreme Court, said the law -which was challenged in several suits brought by landlords - was ''unconstitutional and unenforceable on the grounds that it violates basic constitutional due process rights of S.R.O. property owners.'' In a related development, John Cardinal O'Connor has urged the city to take several steps to preserve the hotel rooms, including the public acquisition of such hotels. [ Page B3. ] The ruling affects between 6,000 and 10,000 vacant housing units that under the law would have been restored as rentals, according to estimates by the Mayor's Office of S.R.O. Housing and by the Coalition for the Homeless, a nonprofit advocacy group."

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Had Michael Griffith been swifter or luckier, he might have escaped, beaten but alive, from the gang that attacked him and two companions Saturday morning in Howard Beach, Queens. Had he not fled onto a parkway and been killed by a passing car, the rest of us might have escaped confronting this harrowing incident and the attitudes it has exposed. There is no escaping now. The awesome fact, as Mayor Koch said in rightful anger, is that a ''racial lynching'' occurred on the streets of New York. Commissioner Benjamin Ward and the Police Department responded with appropriate urgency, assigning 50 investigators to the case, in which 11 white teen-agers have now been arrested. Though the case involved the purest, simplest racism, arrests alone cannot clear it. After a long spell during which it seemed to ebb, racism is once again on the rise - and not just in the dark of night or in the Howard Beaches of the land. It's plenty dirty, but it's not little and, after an era of civil rights gains, it's no longer much of a secret."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"A tempest is brewing at a state forest 200 miles north of here that pits the national bird against the National Guard, creating a debate over which is more American. For the first time on record, a pair of bald eagles have been reported roosting in the Pigeon River Country State Forest near Grayling, Mich. But the Michigan Air National Guard tests combat maneuvers over the forest, and the nest is in the Guard's flight path. Environmentalists fear that the roaring jets may hit the birds or scare them away. The pilots fly so low, Ned Caveney, the forest manager, said, that ''there are times when you're on a hill and you're looking down on the planes.''"
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"In the Brooklyn blocks where Michael Griffith grew up, the tension yesterday was as biting as the cold wind. Though divided in their opinions of Mr. Griffith, those who knew him or who live in his Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood spoke in one voice about the horror of his death last weekend and the fears of racism and violence in parts of the city. Police officers answered ''no comment,'' for the Griffith family yesterday and barred reporters from the floor where Mr. Griffith's mother and family live."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"''Special operations'' is a military term of art encompassing commando tactics, antiterrorism, insurgency and counterinsurgency, psychological warfare, infiltration, foreign training, rescue and just about anything else short of full-blown war. This little-understood facet of military affairs as practiced by special units of the Army, Navy and Air Force has received increasing attention in these days of terrorism and hostage-taking, and legislation was enacted last fall to reorganize the hierarchy in charge of such forces. As a result, a joint command is being created for a general who will control military units dedicated to special operations. There will also be a new assistant secretary of defense in charge of making policy for the forces."

''It will put us on a level playing field with the big guys,'' says Brian C. Cunningham, vice president and counsel of Genentech Inc. Drug exports already provide a rare spot of sunshine amid the dark shadows of the nation's record $170 billion trade deficit. With a trade surplus running at $700 million, total drug exports will be $3 billion this year, up from $2.7 billion in 1985, the Commerce Department says, and the numbers are likely to be even better under the new rules. The Senate Labor Committee, for instance, estimates that drug exports may grow by $400 million to $500 million a year under the loosened restrictions."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"His athletic accomplishments are hardly the stuff of legend, but there are those who believe that David Derdeyn will prove to be the one college athlete of the 1980's whose name most lives on in history. Derdeyn is not a football or basketball star but a cross-country runner at Colorado who is not even No. 1 among the Buffaloes. And those who believe in his chance for immortality are civil liberties lawyers. At a time when athletes at more than 100 American colleges have been dutifully lining up for urinalysis conducted by those schools, Derdeyn is the only one who has come forward to file a court challenge to mandatory mass drug testing."

In 1966, the former art student began to experiment with painting her body. In a new photography book, '' 'Veruschka': Trans-figurations'' (New York Graphic Society, $35), she writes that she hoped to create ''a strangeness that would distract attention from the often very boring dresses'' and a camouflage so ''the public could not trap me so easily.''"

''I was really looking forward to working with Mr. Wilson, to sitting at the feet of the master,'' says the 45-year-old opera singer, a former company member of the New York City Opera. ''I got into rehearsal and at first I was very puzzled. I was asked to do these things that didn't seem to have anything to do with what I was singing. I was asking questions all the time, and I couldn't wait for Bob Wilson to get there so I could get the answers. But when he came, the first thing he said was, 'I have no answers, so don't ask me any questions.' ''"
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"In a move not altogether unexpected, Dan Henning was released today as coach of the Atlanta Falcons, a team that began the season with high expectations and four victories, only to finish 7-8-1. Rankin Smith, the Falcons' owner, also dismissed the five assistant coaches who worked with the offense but invited Marion Campbell, the defensive coordinator, and the other defense assistants to remain. The offensive coaches who were dismissed were Larry Beightol (line), Bobby Jackson (tight ends), Bob Harrison (receivers), Sam Elliott (running backs) and Steve Crosby (quarterbacks). In a statement released by the club and attributed to Smith and his son, Rankin Jr., the president, the Smiths called Henning's dismissal ''a most difficult decision.''"

A different scientifically designed random sample of 1,000 consumers will be interviewed twice each year and subscribers can, for a moderate price, have product-related questions included in the interviews. The research project has been mounted by China Communications, a New York-based firm of which DFS Dorland Worldwide is a minority investor. Penelope Queen, the executive vice president, director of domestic and internatonal relationship of the agency, has supervised much of the preliminary groundwork including the focus-group interviews that helped design the questionnaire."

Past efforts by the United States, France and African neighbors have only contained the colonel's adventurism temporarily. But the lesson is to keep trying. Washington and Paris do right to help Chad defend itself against this new surge of aggression."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"N.W. AYER INC., announced yesterday that it had, as expected, reached an agreement to acquire Cunningham & Walsh, or at least big parts of it. The purchase for an undisclosed amount of cash will not include the agency's Chicago office, BBDM/Cunningham & Walsh, but will include the Direct Marketing Agency in Stamford, Conn., and the Reiser Williams deYong agency of San Francisco and Irvine, Calif. The Chicago office is not being included because about a third of its billings comes from clients that compete with Ayer clients. However, there is very little conflict elsewhere and Ayer already has a Chicago office billing about $70 million."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"As the temperature climbed into the high 70's on June 13, 1975, the Penguins' luck ran out: The ice melted and they went belly up. Shortly after 2 P.M. that day, a squad of agents from the Internal Revenue Service streamed into the Civic Arena, or ''The Big Igloo'' as the Penguins' domed home is called here, and seized the team's only assets - its player contracts - for failure to pay payroll taxes. When the agents left. they padlocked the doors. Eight years after the National Hockey League team first took to the ice, it had gone bankrupt. But the City of Champions, as Howard Cosell nicknamed Pittsburgh, barely noticed. The Pirates and Willie Stargell were on the way to winning a division championship, while the hard-hitting Steelers and Franco Harris seemed to personify the grit and determination of this city."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Westchester County's legislature approved an experimental program today that would subsidize the rents of tenants facing eviction, to avoid the higher costs of sheltering them in hotels and motels.

That's what's going on these days at the Gershwin Theater, where they're knocking down walls, ripping up seats and banging out the rafters to prepare for ''Starlight Express'' -the new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical extravaganza about a roller-skating race scheduled to open here in February. With computer-controlled bridges, nearly a mile of race tracks that extend over the heads of the audience and an ambitious backdrop of America that includes the Grand Canyon, the Rocky Mountains and Mount Rushmore, the set is expected to be the most elaborate and expensive - at more than $2.5 million - in Broadway history."

You refer to these ethnic rulers as ''South Africa's white minority government.'' But the truth is, they are not even that. How could they be, when the white people of Natal have plainly rejected them, in favor of Chief Gatsha Buthelezi and effective majority rule in that province?"
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Two helicopters collided today over western South Korea, burst into flames and then crashed, the police said.

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"The conversation was becoming heated, as barroom debates between fans of opposing college football teams often do. This one involved a Penn State student and an older Notre Dame fan, their voices rising above the din of the jukebox and more pleasant cocktail conversation surrounding them, in the Gipper Lounge in a South Bend, Ind., hotel in 1982. Just when it looked as if the student was going to discover why Notre Dame is nicknamed the Fighting Irish, his female companion nudged him, as if to say, ''Let's change the subject.'' The disagreement was not about mundane matters such as the relative strength of their favorite team or which school played the toughest schedule. Rather, the Penn State student was claiming that his school graduated a higher percentage of football players than Notre Dame. And the older man was insisting the opposite was true. Imagine. Punches were almost exchanged over academics. It is the kind of story that makes Joe Paterno smile, evidence that on some campuses around the country, the primary function of the university has not been forgotten in the heat of athletic competition. In times such as these, even some college presidents have been guilty of losing their perspective on occasion."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"The Consumers Power Company and the Dow Chemical Company have suspended negotiations on converting the Midland nuclear power plant to natural gas and will resume talks after the holidays, the companies said today. The companies have been seeking an agreement on joint conversion of the plant. Consumers stopped work on the plant as a nuclear generator in 1984 after Dow pulled out of an agreement to buy steam from the project amid cost overruns and construction delays."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"History buffs in need of information about any of the 11,700 people who have served in Congress turn to the best available resource, the latest volume of the Biographical Directory of the American Congress. But the best, scholars say, is far from good enough. The current volume, last updated in 1971, is riddled with misinformation. Key dates for many entries are wrong or missing. Party labels are incorrect. Crucial political information is lacking, and mythology is presented as fact. For example, the volume credits several Congressmen with having been the one who caught John Quincy Adams when he collapsed of a stroke on the House floor in 1848; researchers have been unable to confirm that anyone caught the former President when he fell."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"The Roman Catholic Church, whose 800 million members stretch from the slums of Bangladesh to the wealthy suburbs of San Francisco, is in the midst of a fierce struggle over its identity as it moves toward the third millennium after the coming of Christ. The questions being raised are fundamental: What is the nature of the orthodoxy it upholds and who will determine it? How much diversity can the church allow without losing its identity? How much liberty can Catholic scholars be allowed to question, and the faithful to ignore, official teachings? How much freedom will local bishops and national churches have to exercise their authority? A Wider Significance Underlying all the issues is a question that the Second Vatican Council purported to answer two decades ago: What is the relationship between Roman Catholicism and a modern world that seems in turn inhospitable to all orthodoxies and demanding of absolute clarity? The battles within the Catholic Church thus resonate well beyond the confines of its membership. Arguments over human sexuality, the place of the sacred in modern life and the best route to a just social order inevitably draw in and affect those for whom the church's promises of eternal salvation hold little meaning."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Oil prices advanced strongly on world markets yesterday, as the oil community welcomed OPEC's decision to cut production. The key American and British grades surged to nearly $18 a barrel during hectic trading, before slipping back somewhat at day's end. The near-month futures contract for West Texas Intermediate crude oil, the American benchmark, rose to $17.22 a barrel, up 83 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and to $17.05 a barrel, up 55 cents, on the London-based open market.

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"In a stunning finish that affected the playoff fortunes of three teams, the New England Patriots beat the Miami Dolphins tonight, 34-27, in the final game of the National Football League regular season. The triumph gave the Patriots their first Eastern Division title in eight years, forced the Jets into the American Conference wild-card game next Sunday and eliminated the Cincinnati Bengals from playoff contention. The margin of victory was a 30-yard touchdown pass from Steve Grogan, an unlikely hero, to Stanley Morgan with 44 seconds remaining. That pass ended the race between the Jets, who had finished the season Sunday with a fifth straight loss, and the Patriots, who would have been eliminated had they lost to the Dolphins in the Orange Bowl, where New England has lost so many other games over the years."

An important drug against leukemia, for example, came from a periwinkle plant in Madagascar, while other cancer drugs came from oceanic sponges or were brewed in microbial broths. An experimental drug against lung cancer is derived from a mold discovered in damaged lungs of cows that had consumed rotten sweet potatoes."

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"If it's indeed more blessed to give than to receive, then William Perry's heart, if not gladdened, is at least in the right place. The Bears' coach, Mike Ditka, confirmed yesterday that the 350-pound Fridge had been denied all $38,000 that he would have pocketed had he met weight-loss incentives included in his 1986 contract. That sum is in addition to three weight-related fines already levied by Ditka, who, uninclined to Christmas amnesty, promised that the next one would leave Perry substantially lighter in the wallet."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"MADE in association with the pay-cable service Showtime, ''Blood Ties'' seems to be something of an experiment designed to give Italian television a foothold in the lucrative American marketplace. For the most part, Italian productions have stumbled over obvious language barriers. Subtitles are generally thought to be too cumbersome, and most dubbing processes tend to produce a ''lifeless'' soundtrack. The solution for ''Blood Ties''? Make the film in English, with actors who can speak English, even if heavily accented. Presumably, the production will be marketed elsewhere, even in Italy, as a ''foreign film.'' On a purely technical level, the gambit works quite effectively for the co-producers - Italy's RAI broadcasting organization and Viacom International. As late-night viewers can discover tonight at 1:20 A.M. (repeats are scheduled for Monday at 8 P.M. and the following Friday at 11:45 P.M.), the soundtrack for ''Blood Ties'' is as ''natural'' as audiences in this country have come to expect and demand (for whatever reasons, Europeans are not so finicky on this issue)."

Adelman, director of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, has been shuttling between his office at the State Department and duty at the White House, where he has had a key role in the reorganization of the National Security Council. Mr. Adelman is a close friend of Frank C. Carlucci, who was brought in as the national security adviser by President Reagan in an effort to repair damage done by the disclosures that staff officials there had worked on an arms deal with Iran and a diversion of the profits to the rebels fighting the Nicaraguan Government. As in many other Washington instances of someone calling on a trusted aide, this one has old roots. Mr. Adelman once worked for Mr. Carlucci when he headed the Office of Economic Opportunity."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"AFTER two decades of dreaming, planning and development, India's space program has come of age. Once merely a symbol of the nation's pride and ingenuity, Indian space technology has become an integral part of its communications, weather forecasting and resource management systems. ''We started modestly and built step by step,'' said U. R. Rao, director of the Indian space program. ''There was a lot of criticism along the way. But today everyone is convinced that this is the best way to meet the country's needs.'' A few major developing countries, such as Brazil and China, have also developed space technology, principally for military purposes. But Western scientists say that no other country outside the United States, Europe and the Soviet Union has achieved India's broad and deep ability to use space in civilian life. Scientists say India offers a case study of how a developing country can exploit advanced technology to meet fundamental needs."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"OUR neighborhood star has been growing steadily dimmer during the last five years, and if the slump doesn't end pretty soon all of us will be in serious trouble. A gadget aboard the Solar Maximum Mission satellite began measuring radiation from Old Sol in 1980, and for the five years for which data are available sunshine has been declining by a steady 0.019 percent each year. That adds up to a net loss of nearly one-tenth of one percent, which may not sound like much. But climatologists point out that a sustained increase or decrease in solar luminosity of less than three-tenths of a percent would be enough to produce dire results; depending on the direction of the change, the Earth could become a tropical oven or an arctic deep freeze."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"A barge carrying 86,000 gallons of diesel fuel began sinking in the Hudson River yesterday morning, prompting her captain to run aground near Englewood Cliffs, according to the Coast Guard. Fifty gallons of oil spilled through the vents of the barge, the Jane Frank, owned by Standard Marine of New Jersey, but the flow was quickly plugged and the fuel dissipated, a Coast Guard public affairs specialist, Loren Bullard, said."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"THE sun was bright, the wind whipped off Great South Bay, and the temperature was near freezing. Still, Ray Lyons decided it was better to spend Sunday outdoors in the cold, given the alternatives. ''My wife and daughter have gone to fight their way into the malls,'' Mr. Lyons said. ''They left at 9:30 this morning.'' Even as he spoke, he could envision them, embroiled in several holiday savings events and many gigantic storewide sales."

The bank said he was expected to continue as a director and would become a consultant."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"SOME of the most widespread beliefs about the quest for satisfaction with life are misleading or dead wrong, psychologists have found. Achieving a long-held goal, for instance, seems to be less satisfying than simply avoiding unpleasantness from day to day. And while financial security, a happy marriage and fulfilling social activities are all related to contentment, they and similar factors are weak predictors of who will be satisfied with life and who will not. Altogether, such factors explain less than 30 percent of people's reports of satisfaction. Instead, temperament, which changes little over the course of life, is emerging as an unexpectedly strong determinant of how satisfied people report they are. Even stronger is how much time people are able to spend doing things they find most meaningful, are most competent at, and take the most pleasure in."

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Investors are selling stocks these days for what ordinarily might be a most unusual reason: They want to record their capital gains this year, rather than next. Typically, investors who want to cash in their gains wait until the new year, so they can delay paying taxes for a year or more. But taxes on capital gains go up to a maximum 28 percent in 1987, from 20 percent, causing selling pressure that is likely to persist through year-end, tax experts say. Stocks fell very slightly yesterday, but analysts said the tax change is an unknown that is hanging over the market.

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"EXASPERATED by slow progress against leading cancer killers and armed with a sensitive new testing technology, the National Cancer Institute is making a major change in the way it searches for anticancer drugs. The new screening method, officials hope, will be more successful in identifying drugs effective against lung, colon, breast and other common cancers that have resisted chemotherapy up to now. At the same time, the institute has begun a far-flung search in nature for ''biologically active'' chemicals so as to collect a rich trove of novel materials for sifting through the new screen. In coming months the Federal agency will introduce a new testing system that officials expect will determine more quickly and accurately which chemicals out of thousands examined each year might make useful drugs. At present, researchers select chemicals for study by watching their effects on mice with a single form of animal leukemia. This test has yielded some notable successes, mainly against leukemias and lymphomas, but has failed to produce drugs that work against the country's worst cancer threats."

The title is not only deplorable but actively misleading as well, and there is no indication where or when any of the pieces originally appeared; but in other respects the publisher deserves a wholehearted vote of thanks. Barzini was one of the outstanding journalists of his time, and most of the articles and sketches that have been salvaged display the same sparkle that he brought to his celebrated account of his countrymen, ''The Italians.''"

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"JACKIE MASON is a man who can move mountains. At least he has moved the mountains to Manhattan. The mountains in question are the old resort-riddled Catskills that were noted for clear streams, cold borsht and hot comics. In his one-man show, ''The World According to Me!,'' which opened last night at the Brooks Atkinson, Mr. Mason gives hilarious testimony to the art of the stand-up comic. He is such a deft stand-up comic that he is no less funny when he sits down. One starts chuckling as soon as he enters to the regal strains of the ''Masterpiece Theater'' theme and suggests that the stage is bare because you have come to see him, not furniture. He segues through an astonishing quantity of themes. His style is not that of Henny Youngman, which both will be grateful for. No one-liners. No stories, either, a la Sam Levenson. No? What then? No jokes, no stories? From this he makes a living as a comic?"

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"A panel on Government regulations headed by Vice President Bush today proposed abolishing United States fuel economy standards, saying the standards hampered the ability of domestic makers of automobiles to meet the demands of the market. The Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief, assigned by President Reagan to review Federal regulations, also recommended shutting the Interstate Commerce Commission and called for consolidating responsibility for regulating the banking industry. The group would abolish the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, passed during the oil crisis of the 1970's when gas prices were regulated by the Government. The law requires auto makers to meet fuel efficiency standards or face fines. The Department of Transportation, which is headed by Elizabeth Hanford Dole, enforces these standards."

It said yesterday that it could not speculate about details of the offering, including the percentage that would be marketed. It said the offering would be by prospectus, probably early next spring."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Buying a fur coat, especially for the first time, can be traumatic. Whether it is a $2,000 opossum or a $10,000 mink, a fur coat represents a major investment. Many women feel they are singularly unprepared to make a wise decision. Still, the consistent increase in fur business over the last 15 years reflects the fact that more women are buying their own furs -for warmth, glamour or as a sign of success. The independent woman who spends her own money has helped change the fur business, says Viola Sylbert, the fashion designer who has worked for several fur manufacturers. Protests from conservationists who object to the use of pelts from endangered species or inhumane trapping methods have also affected the business."

''Time makes more converts than reason,'' he declares. He is quoting one of the passages of Paine that seems more paradoxical than appropriate when applied to the centuries of the unresolved Irish conflict that has been flickering steadily, almost routinely now, through the past tense year in Lisburn. Speaking with the odd mix of lilt and bite that marks the polemics of both sides in the northern troubles, Mr. McMichael professes absolute innocence of the months of residential gasoline bombings, a selective reign of terror that has been driving Catholic families back to the hard ghettos of Belfast, away from this rare mixed community."

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Although the attention of most Americans is now diverted from the Israeli-Palestinian issue to the Reagan Administration's strange involvement in the Iran-Iraq war, a new drama is taking place in the territories occupied by Israel. The American press, picking up only when the violence begins, reports an occasional killing. Meanwhile, the Israeli press speaks of ''the longest week of bloodletting . . . since the Six-Day War,'' warns that this kind of violence is ''part of a way of life'' because of Israeli settlements in the territories and fears growing vigilantism among the settlers. Opinions vary on why the Palestinians on the West Bank are suddenly becoming more politically active, thereby triggering the harsh repression. But one cause is undoubtedly the new effort by Israel and Jordan to pressure the West Bank population to abandon the Palestine Liberation Organization and accept King Hussein's leadership."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"CARLOS SAURA has set ''El Amor Brujo'' on a stage the size of an airplane hangar, with a sand floor and a horizon that changes color with the film's many moods. The landscape is crisscrossed by telephone wires and populated by shacks in which the film's gypsy characters reside. This setting is imaginative and versatile, and it is by far the most striking thing about ''El Amor Brujo,'' Mr. Saura's flamenco film made in collaboration with Antonio Gades. This is their third such collaboration, after ''Carmen'' (1983) and ''Blood Wedding'' (1981). This film, which freely adapts its story to fit Manuel de Falla's music, is the second version of ''El Amor Brujo'' in which Mr. Gades has appeared (the first, a little-known version that has not been seen here, was directed by Rovira Beleta). In Mr. Saura's film, which opens today at the Cinema Studio 1, Mr. Gades dances the role of Carmelo and also co-choreographed the film with Mr. Saura. The result is a large, colorful production with dance sequences that are a lot livelier than the dramatic passages, though the film divides itself equally between the two. The flamenco choreography is so intrinsically dramatic that the acting passages often seem superfluous anyhow."

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"No nation can solve a problem by creating a crisis. At a time when America needs cool heads and calm cooperation to overcome the mistakes of the Iran arms sales - mistakes that President Reagan has admitted - partisan politics are threatening not only the historic recovery of America's leadership in the world engineered under Mr. Reagan's stewardship but also the capacity of the Presidency to conduct foreign policy in a decisive manner. The stakes are great. The world of 1986 is far different from the world of 1981, when the French historian Jean Francois Ravel's warning that democracy might turn out to be only a footnote in history seemed perilously close to prophecy. A steady erosion of clarity and confidence in Western ideas and values had pushed the West into a decade of decline. Acceptance of a moral equivalence between East and West led many to embrace the notion that detente and economic concessions would attenuate Soviet belligerence. Too many succumbed to the weakness of unilateral restraint and accepted the inevitability of the Brezhnev Doctrine - a nation, once conquered, must and will remain forever in the Communist camp. Small wonder that an emboldened, ever-expanding Soviet empire captured nine nations, and more than three million innocents died at the hands of these brutal dictatorships."

''We have at least 30 hours of fuel left,'' he told the fliers this afternoon."

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"A former Ku Klux Klan leader and Government informer who served as a consultant to the political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. has emerged as a pivotal figure in the Government's fraud case against leaders of the LaRouche organizations. The Federal trial of 13 top aides, fund-raisers and associates, plus five political committees and corporations, is not expected to start until at least April 6, but prosecutors and defense lawyers offered a preview last week in two days of testimony in a detention hearing for three of the aides. Federal prosecutors showed an enlargement of a credit card slip they say is evidence of a scheme used by four fund-raisers based in Boston to obtain more than $1 million to finance Mr. LaRouche's 1984 Presidential effort. Obstruction Is Also Charged The Government will also seek to prove that high-ranking officials in the LaRouche inner circle conspired to block the investigation."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"The Reagan Administration professes a desire to improve education for poor children - but proposes to do so with tuition tax credits and education vouchers. A new willingness to improve existing remedial programs is welcome; these approaches are not, for they would undermine public schools and vital Federal education programs."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"SOME of the best-performing stock groups during 1986 were tobacco, pollution controls, chemicals, apparel manufacturers and building materials. Since this is the season when stock pickers peer ahead, what looks good to them for 1987? There is, obviously, no gilt-edged guarantee in the forecasts. All the same, investors like to know what Wall Street is thinking."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"The list of chemicals contaminating the ground here reads like the Periodic Table of the Elements, with special emphasis on the heavy metals. For most of this century a succession of companies have made dyes and intermediate chemical products on this hilly 35-acre site a quarter-mile from the center of Ashland, dumping the bad batches and the wastes in lagoons carved in the dirt. Now, in an area where three million people are potentially affected, the soil is yielding its burden of mercury, lead, chromium, cadmium and arsenic to the ground water, along with more complicated substances, chemicals that cause cancer or are suspected of causing it, like trichloroethylene, nitrobenzene and chlorinated benzenes. In turn the water pollutes the Sudbury River, once considered a potential source of drinking water for the Boston metropolitan region."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Even with its breathtaking scenery and relaxed life style, the Pacific Northwest was no place for Walter Berry. And he made no secret of it. So last Thursday, the unhappy forward got his wish. Sort of. Berry, the former St. John's forward who was the 14th selection in last spring's collegiate draft, was traded by the Portland Trail Blazers, a team for whom he played only sparingly because of various injuries. But he wasn't sent back East, close to his home in the Bronx, as he had wished. He was traded to the San Antonio Spurs, in exchange for Kevin Duckworth, a 7-foot, 290-pound backup center who was the 33d player selected in last spring's collegiate draft."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"For Jose Luis Torres, these have not been easy times. As chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, the 50-year-old Torres has been at the center of controversy in the convoluted events leading up to and following the Dec. 12 fight for the World Boxing Association heavyweight championship. On that night at Madison Square Garden, James (Bonecrusher) Smith became the champion when he knocked out Tim Witherspoon at 2 minutes 12 seconds of the first round. And while Smith's work was fairly definitive - he knocked Witherspoon down three times before the bout was stopped - what Torres did as commissioner before and after the bout was fuzzy enough to raise questions about his handling of the $66,649-a-year job to which the former light heavyweight champion was appointed by Governor Cuomo in November 1984."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"A Federal child-support program helped collect $2.7 billion from absent parents last year and the 1986 figure is expected to be nearly $3.2 billion, the Department of Health and Human Services said today. ''We have made substantial progress in collecting the support which absent parents owe to their children, and today we are poised for even more dramatic advances,'' Dr. Dr. Otis R. Bowen, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said in a statement accompanying his annual report to Congress on the department's child-support enforcement program. The program, established in 1975, is operated by state and local governments with Federal assistance. It locates missing parents, determines paternity of children born out of wedlock and enforces support agreements and court orders."

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"In these final days before Christmas, a change has come over the Ascension Roman Catholic Church on Carnation Drive here. It is more than the addition of the Christ Child to the manger, more than the presents for the poor around the Christmas tree, more than the children's pageant of angels and wise men, more than the voices of the choir members rehearsing. ''It is a state of mind,'' said an usher, Edward Rooney. ''It is a feeling,'' said the pastor, the Rev. Thomas E. Davis. ''Whatever it is,'' added a parishioner, Brendan Suter, ''it completes our Christmas.''"
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"WATCHING I.B.M. has long been a favorite pastime in the computer industry, and none of that company's products have been more closely scrutinized than its personal computers. It was Big Blue, after all, that made the personal computer respectable, allowing executives to roll up their sleeves and delve right into Flight Simulator along with the most ardent of the hobbyists. Over the last couple of years, I.B.M. has introduced the Jr., portable and convertible models, but for all its past victories in the personal computing arena, Attila from Armonk hasn't won any battles lately. That precious benchmark, its market share, is slipping."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Black civic and political leaders, both loudly and softly, said yesterday that the attack by white youths on three black men in Queens last weekend was convincing evidence that racially motivated violence was a ''pervasive problem and not an isolated one,'' as some people had maintained. The attack has generated demonstrations and calls for multiracial efforts to improve race relations, as well as more confrontational tactics, such as conducting hearings in the mostly white Howard Beach area on racial violence. The incident has also spawned the formation of at least two ad hoc committees, each with the goal of trying to examine the causes of such incidents. Searches for an Explanation One is a multiracial panel organized by the New York Civil Liberties Union. The other involves a group of black ministers and civic leaders who inspired hearings on charges of police brutality against blacks in New York City three years ago."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,Pope John Paul II said today that the day of prayer for peace at Assisi two months ago should serve as a model for interfaith cooperation and ecumenical initiatives.

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,The Quebec Court of Appeal today struck down a provision in the province's nine-year-old language law that prohibits the use of languages other than French on public signs. The ruling was a victory for store owners and others in the province who have persisted in displaying English signs alongside French ones. But it seemed likely to stir further ferment among groups that have made their insistence on French-only signs a central issue in recent demonstrations against the Quebec government.
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"A former criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska, wanted as a fugitive from justice in New York State since 1975, has decided to turn himself over to New York authorities, his lawyer said today.

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"''This is 'Brigadoon,' '' a resident of Howard Beach told a reporter a few years ago, when questions about the neighborhood were asked in a more innocent context. Yet now, in the aftermath of the beatings of three black men by a dozen whites, the comment has taken on a new and different resonance. For while Brigadoon was a paradise, as many in Howard Beach see their community on Jamaica Bay, it was fixed in the past. So, too, Howard Beach seems to have existed independent of the rest of New York City, isolated by natural barriers, belatedly tethered to the mass transit system and largely unmarked by the racial integration that has transformed the face of dozens of other neighborhoods. ''Howard Beach is a small town,'' said Andrew Hacker, a professor of political science at Queens College and an expert on New York neighborhoods. ''It is isolated and it is insulated. There is something about it like Bay Ridge in 'Saturday Night Fever.' It's far from the city, a long way from the city.''"
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"It's time to put on the dancing shoes and kick up your heels. From now till New Year's Eve, there'll be plenty of excuses to get dressed up.

It's a safe bet that not since Louis XIV has there been such a choice of fancy and fanciful foot coverings."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"How do you make a movie out of ''Native Son''? Richard Wright's book, which was published in 1940, is still assigned in hundreds of high school and college classes. It has now been made into a movie, which opens Wednesday in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. The first commercially successful novel in which a black writer confronted white America with his anger, ''Native Son'' has long been considered of great sociologic as well as literary importance. But critics, both black and white, also acknowledge that from today's perspective the book has serious flaws."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Stock prices fell yesterday as trading reverted to more normal levels after the record-breaking session on Friday caused by the ''triple witching hour.'' Yesterday's turnover of 157.6 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, while hefty by ordinary standards, was far below the historic 244.7 million shares traded Friday. The simultaneous expiration of stock-index futures, index options and regular stock options on Friday caused an avalanche of orders in the final minutes of trading."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"''FOR centuries,'' said the program notes at Sunday afternoon's Empire Brass concert at Carnegie Hall, ''these instruments have had specific functions entirely separate from the standard ensembles of 'elevated' music-making,'' and so, in a way, they still do. There is something about the sheer brave sound of brass instruments that appeals beyond the constituency of the normal symphony orchestra, crosses some of the pop-classical dividing lines and rouses an audience to special approval -particularly when the players are as good as Sunday's, and whether or not the music is. Indeed, the program notes were devoted more to the instruments and their sounds than to the music - and when they got around to the latter, it turned out to be the music for a different program! That's not to say that the music played at Carnegie Hall was second rate, but that it played second fiddle."

1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Three white teen-agers were charged last night with second-degree murder in the beating of three black men in Howard Beach, Queens, the police said. One of the victims was killed by a car as he fled early Saturday from what the authorities called a nightmarish racial attack. The arrests, in what Mayor Koch described as ''a racial lynching'' and ''the most horrendous incident'' of his nine years at City Hall, came as city officials, clergymen, civil-rights activists and community leaders expressed outrage at the crime and began a reassessment of race relations in the city. The police said the suspects had left a party when they heard that the three blacks were walking through their mostly white, middle-class community early Saturday, and, in two attacks in an eight-block chase punctuated by racial taunts and insults, kicked and beat the victims with fists, a baseball bat and a tree limb. Details of the Beatings One of the black men escaped with a single blow of the bat. A second was beaten severely. A third, Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old Brooklyn construction worker, was also beaten severely and was struck and killed by a car on the Shore Parkway near Cross Bay Boulevard as he tried to run away."

But they put off until next year a decision on how to pay for parts of the program. The agreement, which is expected to be voted Tuesday, averts the immediate fare increases that had been threatened by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Instead, an existing tax that would have expired Dec. 31 is to be extended."
1986-12-23T00:00:00Z,The creation of 23 new judgeships to beef up New York City's ability to try crack cases gave Governor Cuomo a chance to fight the state's boss-ridden system for picking judges.

North in the hope that they would then tell what they knew about the Iran arms affair, the White House said today. The chief White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, said Mr. Reagan had discussed the option last week, but had decided instead to urge Congressional investigative committees to grant limited immunity to the two former White House officials. Mr. Speakes's acknowledgment was the first public confirmation that Mr. Reagan had considered using a pardon as a tactic to assure the public that he is interested in full disclosure regarding the secret sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of money to Nicaraguan rebels."

''The opportunities are endless; my only problem is time,'' said Mr. Kiam, who has starred in his own television advertising around the world for five years. In 18 languages, some of them hastily memorized, he has made the cheery pitch that Remington's shavers ''shave as close as a blade, or your money back.'' But now he is trying to extend his pitch beyond shavers, which were scheduled to be shipped out of Remington's plant by the thousands for the holiday sales rush. Having built Remington into the world's second-largest manufacturer of electric shavers - it trails only Norelco, a subsidiary of Philips N.V., the Dutch concern - Mr. Kiam has added a host of offbeat consumer goods that range from machine washable neckties to a portable vacuum that chemically cleans rugs."

Many of those who find themselves suddenly out of work will have the benefit of outplacement services to help them find jobs. Others, however, especially those who take early retirement, often are not offered outplacement help. Buying such assistance on an individual basis can be not only expensive but also disappointing.

A.Caffeine represents only 1 percent of the coffee bean and it is highly unlikely that coffee breeders could eliminate it, according to Dr. William Pardee, chairman of the department of plant breeding at Cornell University. But it could be reduced, he said, if coffee plants were cross-bred with related plants that produce beans low in caffeine. The offspring would then be crossed with other coffee plants. The procedure would be repeated until it resulted in a plant producing flavorful, low-caffeine beans. This process, which might require many generations of plants, would take years, he said."

''It's the normal year-end phenomenon, exacerbated by some special circumstances this year,'' said Allan Lerner, a managing director at the Bankers Trust Company. As the year draws to a close, he said, large banks expect to see heavy loan demand related to leveraged buyouts of corporations, merger and acquisition activity, and the financing of large inventories held by securities dealers. The latest jump in short-term rates, which followed steep increases last week, resulted in some banks paying as much as 9 percent for 30-day time deposits in London. While most 30-day deposits in London went at 8 percent to 8 1/2 percent, even those rates were well above the 7 3/16 percent of last Friday or the 6 1/4 percent of Dec. 15."

In a schedule that rivals the old Palace vaudeville calendar, ''A Holday Celebration'' goes on a two-a-day basis, but for today only. This two-part event performs at 10:30 A.M. and again at noon, with emphasis on song and dance. The program is part of Jacques d'Amboise's ''Celebration'' series -a product of the Lincoln Center ''Meet the Artist'' project and the National Dance Institute - a series created to introduce students to live performance. More than 150 of the institute's children will perform ''Fat City,'' a story-ballet set in an imaginary place. In this production, conceived and directed by Mr. d'Amboise, Maureen McGovern, who recorded ''The Morning After'' and had a starring role in both ''Nine'' and ''The Pirates of Penzance,'' will be featured, along with the dancers Valerie Wright and Donlin Foreman. The piece itself, which was performed in the film ''He Makes Me Feel Like Dancing,'' is said to include original music by George Balanchine and Christopher d'Amboise."

However, because the strength was limited to those two areas, analysts generally dismissed the big gain as telling little about future economic growth. Without the huge military increase, orders would have risen a much smaller six-tenths of 1 percent."
1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"In time, the investigation into the Iranian arms controversy will end. There may be prosecutions, new laws, a reorganization of the National Security Council. But one thing that is vitally necessary may not happen at all - creation of a new compact between the executive and legislative branches that will permit the United States to discharge more effectively its responsibilities as a great power. From Vietnam, through Watergate, to the present, in Democratic and Republican Administrations, the estrangement between the White House and Capitol Hill has deepened. Congress distrusts the President and insists on multiplying checks - oversight committees, the War Powers Act, media leaks and legislative vetoes. The White House responds in kind - building up the National Security Council staff as an isolated and autonomous operational agency, appealing over the heads of Congress to the public, managing its own pattern of leaks and counter-leaks."

North was hospitalized for 10 days in 1974 for emotional distress, but the White House was unaware of his medical history when it hired him in 1981 for the staff of the National Security Council, according to an authoritative Pentagon source. Richard V. Allen, who was President Reagan's national security adviser until January 1982, said today that he did not know about the hospitalization when he hired Colonel North in the summer of 1981. Had he known, Mr. Allen said, Colonel North probably would not have been asked to join the White House staff."

The renovations, to be done by private developers, nonprofit community groups and contractors hired by the city, would be underwritten by $240 million of the city's capital funds, the largest such investment made by the city for housing.

The sparkle of this season's wrapping paper has been preserved through advances in resin technology and water-based inks, despite a major change in the way wrapping paper is printed as a result of Federal regulations aimed at reducing air pollution. When the air pollution regulations caused paper makers to abandon petroleum-based inks, which released solvents into the atmosphere as the ink dried, manufacturers reluctantly turned to expensive nonsolvent water-based inks, which had been limited to a small, specialized segment of the $1.6 billion Christmas wrap industry. These inks were not known for their color integrity and their use in high-speed, high-quantity presses was virtually untested."

Not that Steve Grogan's contribution to the Patriots was ever inconspicuous. As the backup to the starting quarterback, Tony Eason, who is younger by six years and less experienced by eight seasons, Grogan calls the plays for Eason from the sidelines, a novel situation by most standards. But Monday night, in the final National Football League game that would be played in the Orange Bowl, Grogan was calling his own plays, now in charge because of an odd injury Eason suffered earlier."

Returning from a four-game layoff caused by muscle pulls in both thighs, the 6-foot-9-inch Woolridge, who replaced Jeff Turner in the lineup with 5 minutes 45 seconds remaining in the opening quarter, scored 23 points that helped the Nets defeat the Utah Jazz, the hottest team in the National Basketball Association, 119-96, at Byrne Meadowlands Arena. While the Nets, running their fast break better than at any time this season, brought their record to 6-19 with successive victories for the first time this season, the bigger, stronger and deeper Jazz, playing their sixth game in the last eight nights, lost for only the second time in the last 12 games.

1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"Beset by creditors and exhausted by a feat that had defied all others, Richard G. Rutan and Jeana Yeager took their places yesterday among the legendary pilots of history. Their world-circling flight in the Voyager was a family affair, in which ingenuity and courage served in place of the big budgets and engineering teams of the aerospace industry. Like the Wright brothers' Flyer, the Voyager incorporates a pioneering aeronautical design and some of the most advanced structural materials of its day. But in other respects the Voyager is as crude as any airplane that ever flew, and its flight into the record books had less to do with space-age technology than with the personal sacrifices, improvisations and dedication of its impecunious creators. The peculiar looking airplane will probably take its place in the National Air and Space Museum with Charles A. Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis, Wiley Post's Winnie Mae and one of Amelia Earhart's Electras, but for all its celebrity, the Voyager is made mostly out of paper and plastic, and its builders expect to have to go on selling souvenir T-shirts and tie tacks to help pay the estimated $550,000 that it cost to build the plane."

Like much of the current engagement, running through Jan. 4, the new piece stresses the quicksilver muscular control of the 10 dancers who serve their choreographer so well. Other works in this third program of the season at the Joyce Theater, Eighth Avenue and 19th Street, were ''Cantos,'' ''Persons and Structures,'' an item entitled ''Excerpt From Arporisms'' and ''The Mechanical Organ.'' A program note for ''Cantos'' (1957) states that it was ''one of Mr. Nikolais's early abstract pieces, which used his new theory of decentralization and minimal motional poetry.'' The decentralization of the stage picture, whether that is what Mr. Nikolais means by the term, is obvious in that there is no single hero or heroine. Instead, our attention is dispersed - often, we see the activity initially out of the corner of an eye."

But the scar on the side of the puck revealed that this goal, which moved Bossy into fifth place on the league's career scoring roster with 557 career goals, was inelegantly obtained. With the overtime session threatening to remain indecisive as the hour of hockey that preceded it, Bossy stationed himself within whispering distance of the Pittsburgh goalie, Roberto Romano. When Steve Konroyd launched a slapshot, it caromed off Bossy's skate, and between the goalie's legs for the winning goal with 1 minute 35 seconds left on the clock."

Yesterday I.B.M. shares dropped 2 5/8 points, to 120 1/2, in heavy trading as analysts revised downward already depressed 1986 earnings estimates for the company. Analysts now expect I.B.M. will report 1986 earnings of $8 to $8.25, down from the $8.50 to $8.75 previously projected. Analysts attributed their revised 1986 estimates to I.B.M.'s announcement last Thursday that it would take a $250 million fourth-quarter charge to cover the early retirement of 10,000 employees. But I.B.M.'s simultaneous announcement that it would have to continue cost-cutting efforts because it saw ''no signs of improvement'' in business worldwide prompted many analysts to lower estimates for 1987 as well."

He's a mountain in the flat literary landscape that surrounds him. Raised in black poverty in the greatly depressed Chicago of the 1930's, Bigger is unrelenting in his anger with the white world. He's especially scathing about the do-gooders who mean well, but who patronize him by assuming they can understand what black poverty, hopelessness and ignorance are all about. Bigger has murder in his heart."

There would be elves making toys, reindeer feeding on the lawn and Santa - not some skinny department store impostor - seated upon a red throne to greet his young, wide-eyed visitors.

Warner will receive a number of considerations in return, including an option to buy into a theater chain at favorable terms. Cannon, an aggressive film producer that grew rapidly, only to run into financial straits and difficulties with Federal regulators, was close to defaulting on a debt to Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd., a company headed by Alan Bond, the Australian businessman. Cannon said the deal with Warner allowed it to pay off the debt of about $76.2 million today."
1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"Sometimes this can be a contentious country, the kind of place where discord can disrupt the calm surface of everyday life like a fist through cellophane, puncturing even a Christmas season with strikes, lines, bad tempers, and memories of even worse conflicts in the past. A sign of the mood came here the other day when the transportation authorities of Paris painted 10 city buses in a large black-and-white pattern as part of a $250,000 advertising campaign by Black and White Scotch, which wanted the buses to roam through the seasonally festooned streets, suggesting the whisky as a gift. But, then, the Autonomous Machinists Union, which represents the bus drivers, frustrated the plan by refusing to operate the painted vehicles. ''The Parisians are used to the color of their buses and they don't want that to be overturned,'' explained Roland Dufeu, a leader of the union. Paris buses are a classic green and white with large rectangular spaces reserved for advertising."

At an arraignment in Criminal Court in Queens, a prosecutor said the three defendants had admitted taking part in the attack, which began outside a pizza parlor and continued as a gang of whites chased three black men down a dead-end street. The white youths entered no pleas at the hearing. The authorities were also investigating two other attacks the same night in Howard Beach, a small, middle-class community near Kennedy International Airport. The police said yesterday that the three incidents appeared to be unrelated, although students from the same high school were involved in two of the incidents."

1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"A PRICELESS bit of recording-studio chatter has been preserved in ''The Sun Country Box,'' a new 10-record boxed set from West Germany's Bear Family label. The country and rockabilly singer Warren Smith has just finished a performance and is asking to try again. ''Let's do it once more so I can put out on it,'' he says. ''I was just gettin' the feel that time.'' The intuitive recording method that was developed at the Sun label in Memphis during the 1950's has never been more trenchantly expressed. First the singers and musicians agreed on a ''feel'' - a rhythmic and emotional stance - for each song. Once they'd arrived at the feel, they could ''put out'' - inject some intensity into the performance. The Sun label's owner, Sam Phillips, used the same method whether he was recording bluesmen like Howling Wolf and B. B. King, creating some of the first rock-and-roll with Elvis Presley, or making country recordings like the ones collected in ''The Sun Country Box.''"

They are, after all, in the playoffs and will be facing either a quarterback with such a severely injured thumb he can't practice or his backup. Coach John Mackovic of the Kansas City Chiefs said yesterday he would wait until Sunday before deciding whether Bill Kenney or Todd Blackledge would play against the Jets. Kenney, the starter, banged his right thumb on a teammate's helmet last month and Blackledge started for him the next game as the Chiefs beat the Broncos. Kenney returned and the Chiefs beat the Raiders. But Kenney reinjured the thumb in the regular-season finale against the Steelers Sunday and Mackovic is now preparing Blackledge to start. But if Kenney's sore thumb heals dramatically, he will take the field."

Frank Capra's ageless fable of the triumph of goodness, charity and family love over wealth and power turned 40 this year. It's still known to make grown men weep, even as the opening credits roll, and it's not hard to pick sides in the struggle between the pure good of Jimmy Stewart - as George Bailey, the people's champion - and the pure evil of Lionel Barrymore's avaricious Henry F. Potter. Potter, the banker, owns half the town (and all its slums); Bailey pilots his sinking building and loan so that poor people can buy their own homes."
1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"For The Associated Press, covering the Iran arms affair has become a daily balancing act between a responsibility to provide full coverage and a desire not to endanger the lives of the Western hostages in Lebanon, according to the news service's top managers. Those hostages include The A.P.'s chief Middle East reporter, Terry A. Anderson, who was forced at gunpoint into a green Mercedes in Beirut in March 1985 and is apparently still the captive of a Moslem extremist organization. A.P. executives have said that in the months since Mr. Anderson's abduction, they occasionally have removed their journalistic hats to confer with State Department and White House officials, including Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, on an off-the-record basis as they sought Mr. Anderson's release. Restraints on Reporting According to a memorandum issued Nov. 6 by Walter R. Mears, the executive editor, anxiety that A.P. coverage could put Mr. Anderson's life and the lives of the other hostages at risk has prompted careful internal scrutiny of the A.P. report and a prohibition on originating ''investigative reporting about the inside details of efforts to gain freedom for American hostages still in Lebanon.''"

If Santa is on an enrichment kick, a lot of children will be disappointed to find surprises such as Fun With Sums mathematics drills under the tree tomorrow morning instead of something halfway decent, like Rambo toy jungle weaponry. Richard Clymore, shopping in a toy store this week, said his gifted 7-year-old came right out and asked whether he was going to get some ''cool'' toys this year - you know, He-Man, Lazer Tag and the rest of that good stuff he sees on television - or if the old red-suited taskmaster would be slipping down the chimney again with more mineral-identification kits and figure-analysis games. Mr. Clymore and a lot of other parents of gifted children were shopping in a store in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn.

1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"FOOD and Christmas are inextricably bound in memory. For most people, Christmas conjures up the smell of cinnamon, cider and chestnuts, of turkey or goose roasting and ham baking, and the vision of friends and family at the table making merry. For writers, the holiday often means ritual with food at its heart, ritual that inevitably becomes the seed of a story. This year six writers, Eudora Welty, Garrison Keillor, Mary Lee Settle, Samuel R. Delany, Reynolds Price and Joyce Maynard, share their memories of Christmas food and the people with whom they savored it. EUDORA WELTY IN our house while I was growing up, I don't remember that hard liquor was served at all except on one day in the year. Early on Christmas morning, we woke up to the sound of the eggbeater: Mother in the kitchen was whipping up eggnog. All in our bathrobes, we began our Christmas before breakfast. Throughout the day Mother made batches afresh. All our callers expected her eggnog. It was ladled from the punch bowl into punch cups and silver goblets, and had to be eaten with a spoon. It stood up in peaks. It was rich, creamy and strong. Mother gave full credit for the recipe to Charles Dickens."

But for the time being, that is the sorry state of things, despite the fact that a service offering top foreign and ''art'' films plus performance specials would seem tailor-made for New York viewers. An exceptionally fine example can be found in ''The Mystery Plays,'' being offered this week at 10 o'clock on three consecutive evenings - tonight, tomorrow and Friday. The plays, adapted by the British poet Tony Harrison, are taken from 15th-century ''mystery'' cycles, notably those from York. They focus on the life and death of Jesus while spanning everything from the Creation to the Last Judgment. In medieval times, they consisted of ''scenes'' mounted on wagons and performed before clusters of spectators gathered at ''stations.'' In churches today, there remain the Stations of the Cross, depictions of events leading up to the Crucifixion. The mystery plays were generally performed, from morning to evening, by members of various guilds, amateur actors who would be neighbors to those watching. In a seamless community of religious beliefs, performers and audience became a tightly knit unit."

Lynne Cheney of the National Endowment for the Humanities, a Reagan appointee, called the series an ''anti-Western diatribe,'' refused to release $50,000 for publicizing it and requested that the Endowment be dropped as a sponsor. One is hard pressed to find a basis for the claims. Mr. Mazrui does not blame the West for all of Africa's problems. He blames Africans as much as he blames the West. Mr. Mazrui pokes subtle fun at Africans when he shows the women in high-heel shoes and Western dress and the men in wool suits in tropical climes. He does not blame the West for this as much as he blames Africans for being prone to unnecessary Western influence. ''Our ancestors,'' he says, ''will not be happy with the deal modern Africa has struck with the 20th century because we have traded much of our cultural heritage for Western civilization.'' Not that he lets the West off completely."

At a time when they most need to make a trade, the team's general manager, Scotty Stirling, is discovering two things: the first is that every player of any value around the league is being paid more than other teams believe he is worth, and secondly, that the salary cap restrictions have handcuffed him from making the few trades teams are willing to discuss. ''Right now, I just don't think our personnel is good enough,'' Stirling said on Monday after the Knicks broke an eight-game losing streak with a victory over the San Antonio Spurs. ''But when you talk about Player A, Player B or Player C who can help us, they just aren't available. The better players are on the better teams and we just can't get those guys.''"

The management of the Express realized today that 10 consecutive losses are no way to make fans forget the Arrows, the Express's predecessor in the M.I.S.L.

The defendant, Robert E. Chambers Jr., who is 20 years old, has pleaded not guilty to murder, asserting that he killed Miss Levin accidentally while the two were having sex in the park. Mr. Chambers's attorney, Jack T. Litman, has said the diary is relevant evidence because it ''chronicles'' Miss Levin's previous sexual activities. State Supreme Court Justice Howard E.

By late January or February, however, you may start wondering whether you can stand another dark, cold, lonely winter day. Depression, irritability, sleepiness, inertia, boredom, restlessness, impatience and dissatisfaction seem to characterize the postholiday months for millions of Americans who reside in the so-called frost belt. The problem is so common that medical science has given it a name - cabin fever. In Anchorage, where the sun barely rises above the horizon in December on the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, a special clinic deals with victims of cabin fever, many of whom abuse alcohol or each other after weeks of being cooped up. The situation is only slightly better in many of the 48 lower states, in which people commonly leave home before sunrise and leave work after sunset. Sometimes they don't leave home at all. Bundling up to confront the cold and snow, they reason, simply isn't worth doing - unless absolutely necessary."

1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"One of the reasons for dividing time into years is that it gives us a week or so for reflection on the past and the future.

1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"Richard Serra, whose ''Tilted Arc'' sculpture in Lower Manhattan has been the focus of intense controversy for nearly two years, has filed suit against the General Services Administration, the Federal agency that commissioned the work, charging breach of contract and other violations of the artist's rights. The suit, filed last week in Federal District Court in Manhattan, also names William J. Diamond, the regional administrator of the General Services Administration in New York, as a defendant, and seeks a total of $30 million in punitive damages and to compensate for harm to the artist's career and reputation. The sculpture, a 12-foot-high, 112-foot-long steel wall, bisects the plaza in front of the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building at 26 Federal Plaza. In March 1985, a five-member panel named by Mr. Diamond heard testimony in a three-day public hearing on the sculpture, at which many local office workers and professionals of the art world testified. The panel ultimately recommended that the work be removed."
1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"President Reagan and the Senate intelligence committee disagreed today over whether the White House or the committee should be responsible for making public the panel's findings on the Iran affair. Mr. Reagan, asserting that he wanted the American people to ''judge for themselves,'' urged the committee to provide its initial findings so that he could declassify the information and make it available to the public. But Dave E. Holliday, a spokesman for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, indicated that the panel would not honor the request, although he said it was considering releasing a public report on its own. ''We are not moving to produce a report for the White House that would contain classified information,'' he said. ''We are moving to produce a public report.''"

At the same time, a second suspect, Scott Kern, was described as ''a normal kid'' by a black youth who said he socialized with him.

1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"THE way they tell it in my family, at first there was no Hanukkah. My immigrant grandparents, once pious, felt overwhelmed, it seemed, by six children clamoring for melting-pot America. In December, presents were exchanged. It wasn't Christmas, but it wasn't Hanukkah either. The calendar obliged: it juxtaposed, or even overlapped, the holidays. Assimilation? Hardly. The family dinner was likely to be pot roast and potato pancakes, called by their Yiddish name, latkes. Slippage. What happened after that is the story of how an immigrant family, by its third generation, reclaimed traditions abandoned in its first."

The ruling, by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, means that Bankers Trust may continue placing commercial paper - short-term i.o.u.'s issued by large corporations that are traded in the open market. The New York banking company's commercial paper group had been hamstrung by the possibility that the court would rule against it. ''A legal cloud has been removed from the bank's commercial paper operation,'' said Thomas Parisi, the Bankers Trust spokesman."

In areas unprotected by the wall, corps officials estimate that the lake will eat as far as 35 feet into the shoreline each year, said Paul Mohrhardt, chief of the agency's plan formulation branch."

1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"President Reagan's new budget will propose sweeping changes in farm programs designed to save more than $16 billion over the next five years, Administration officials said today. James C. Miller 3d, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the proposals were based on the assumption that current farm programs, which cost more than $25.5 billion in the fiscal year 1986, had become politically unsustainable. Referring to members of Congress, he said, ''A lot more people represent nonfarm districts than farm districts.'' Support for Some Proposals Because key concepts in some of the proposals resemble ideas contained in legislation introduced last year by Senators Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, a Republican, and David L. Boren of Oklahoma, a Democrat, the Administration says some of its proposals may receive a favorable reception in Congress. But other proposals, especially those that would cut farmers' income most sharply, are sure to face opposition on Capitol Hill."

They call themselves the Union des Grands Crus de Bordeaux because they represent all the classified chateaus, as they are known, in the Bordeaux region. There are several thousand chateaus, but only 61 hold the classified status. For this year's road show, the fourth since the union was created, an impressive sampling of 52 of the best-known wines of the Medoc, St.-Emilion, Pomerol, Graves and Sauternes were to be offered at simultaneous tastings on Nov. 28 in Paris, London, New York and Montreal. As in the past, the tastings, which are held mostly for journalists and wine professionals, were to be coordinated by Steven Spurrier, the Paris and London wine merchant, who also runs L'Academie du Vin, a Paris wine school with branches in London and New York. The tasting always marks the public debut of the previous year's vintage, in this case 1985. Interest was high because 1985 had been billed as particularly good."

They are driving from their hometown of Bay City, Wis., to California so that the girl - Ann - can become a child star. In lieu of eating at restaurants, they steal vegetables from convenient farm trucks, and they use a borrowed credit card to charge gasoline and one-night stays at cheap motels. Behind them, to the east, is their old life, a life of modest expectations, modest comforts and modest rewards; ahead lies California, and all the glittering promises of that golden land."
1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"THE rediscovery of cabbage may be partly attributed to health-care professionals' announcements that cabbage and all members of that family - broccoli, brussels sprouts and so on - are excellent sources of vitamin C. I prefer to think this newfound passion springs from cabbage's inherent good flavor. I first became aware of the new vogue in cabbage cookery when I dined nearly a decade ago at a two-star restaurant during a visit home to Burgundy. I feasted on cabbage filled with fresh foie gras and briefly steamed. I recently cooked my own variation by filling cabbage leaves with a mousse of chicken flavored with a bit of grated fresh ginger and then served with a sweet and sour sauce. The dish goes well with plain rice or rice with smoked ham."

Crowds of demonstrators opposed to the bill gathered outside the Congress as the voting occurred just before midnight, and riot policemen filled the surrounding streets to assure safe exit for members of the Chamber of Deputies. Earlier in the evening, the majority leader of the Chamber, Cesar Jaroslavsky, was struck by demonstrators when he went outside briefly. The law establishes a period of 60 days for the continued filing of charges, but after that ''penal action will be extinguished'' on cases arising from the so-called ''dirty war'' against leftists. It was drafted under pressure from military leaders, who have argued that their actions during that era had ample public support."

Although some market participants professed to be nervous about the near-unanimity of forecasts calling for a weak economy and lower interest rates early next year, their skepticism has not been evident in recent trading. The 7 1/2 percent Treasury bonds due in 2016, for example, have managed to improve slightly for three consecutive days, rising 5/32 yesterday to an offered price of 101 31/32 to yield 7.34 percent. The strength of the bellwether Treasury bond led officials at one securities firm to say in an internal memorandum that the bond market's performance is ''defying the law of gravity.'' They noted that earlier this year the combination of weakness in the value of the dollar and rising oil prices often led to lower prices for Treasury issues. Crude oil futures prices fell yesterday, but are still higher than the levels that prevailed before oil-exporting countries agreed during the weekend to curtail output."

The document, written about a year ago, acknowledged that the arms sales conflicted with Administration policy on terrorism, but described Mr. Reagan as determined to rescue the American hostages in Lebanon, the official said.

The man in question was not a latter-day Catholic dissident, but John Carroll, the first Catholic Bishop of the United States, elected by his fellow clergymen in 1789. Pope Pius VI agreed to leave the choice to them, which was not unusual at the time. The story of Bishop Carroll underlines the unusual role that America has played in the Roman Catholic Church and the fact that conflicts today between Rome and elements of the American church are not new. Genuine Conflicts The recent struggles have been bitter, however, dividing the American church itself. And despite the insistence of some American bishops that differences between Rome and American Catholics are exaggerated, Vatican officials say the conflicts are genuine and have an importance that transcends the United States."

Among the most beautiful bells to be heard are the 74 bells in the Laura Spelman Rockefeller memorial carillon atop Riverside Church, on the heights above the Hudson River, at 120th Street and Riverside Drive."

He died when the bin was picked up by a truck for dumping and no one realized he was in it. It is not the sort of tragedy that is supposed to happen in Lexington. This is palmy bluegrass, the home of fast horses, beautiful women and 86-proof bourbon. It is the place where people talk about the quality of their lives."

Ciba-Geigy, the maker of the drug, stressed that it was not a potential AIDS cure. The drug is clofazimine, which Ciba-Geigy will market under the brand name of Lamprene. Its stated purpose is to treat a form of leprosy that has become resistant to other drugs, and it has been used for that purpose for the last decade outside the United States."

Secord, the retired major general who has emerged as a figure in the clandestine arms sales to Iran and has been linked to support for contra rebels in Nicaragua, refused again today to testify before a Congressional hearing into the operations, according to a Congressional official. His brief appearance before a House committee brought to a close this year's efforts by Congress to investigate the arms transactions and the subsequent diversion of funds to the contras. Members of the Select Committee on Intelligence have said the refusal of key witnesses to testify has thwarted full discovery of the facts so far. It was the second time that the retired Air Force general had invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination."

Mr. Weinberger's decision on the Navy request, which is part of the Defense Department's budget requests for the fiscal years 1988 and 1989, will insure the Navy's ability to maintain ''15 deployable carrier battle groups beyond the year 2000,'' said Robert Sims, a Pentagon spokesman. The two new carriers, as yet unnamed, would be completed in 1995 and 1998 and would probably replace the Forrestal and the Saratoga, which were built in the mid-1950's and would be nearing the end of their 45-year service lives by the year 2000."

''Just because I'm a wolf doesn't mean I ain't refined,'' he insists to his fellow denizens of the forest. Unfortunately for Lone, his gentlemanly blandishments are peppered with malapropisms. ''Your riding hood is of a beauteous exquisivity,'' he gushes to Red Riding Hood when they first meet. Handing her his card, he explains that his name is Wolf, ''as in Thomas and Virginia,'' and tries to pass himself off as a vegetarian."
1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"Tension between the State Department and the Defense Department on arms control usually arises when the Pentagon hawkishly attacks diplomatic moves to restrain nuclear weapons. The State Department, for its part, is seen as more amenable to limiting nuclear arms. But that pattern only pertains to the arms race as classically defined, the contest for nuclear supremacy between the United States and the Soviet Union. When it comes to halting the spread of nuclear arms to more nations, experts say, the Pentagon turns strict while the State Department becomes lax."
1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"The criminal sanctions threatened by Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston aren't the only legal avenue being discussed these days as a weapon against gratuitous violence in professional sports. It was Mayor Flynn, of course, who was so upset by a brawl between the Bruins and the Montreal Canadiens a month ago that he threatened to order the arrest of any hockey player who went beyond hard checking on the Boston Garden ice. While he presses his point in meetings with the Bruin front office this week, there's a large body of practitioners eager to impose a solution of their own: multimillion-dollar damage suits on behalf of players injured by acts of flagrant violence."

The journey of 25,012 miles set records for distance flown without refueling and for endurance by aviators on such a flight. The trip, which began and ended at Edwards Air Force Base, 60 miles northeast of Los Angeles, took 9 days 3 minutes 44 seconds. ''This was the last major event of atmospheric flight,'' Richard G. Rutan, 48 years old, said at a news conference after he landed the plane. ''That we did it as private citizens says a lot about freedom in America.''"
1986-12-24T00:00:00Z,"THE first ''Rigoletto'' of the season Monday night proved a dispiriting illustration of the Metropolitan Opera's dilemma over bread-and-butter Italian operas. They must be increasingly relied upon for their box-office draw, yet the company's roster is shallowest in the area of singers who can perform them with distinction. The schedule is inevitably a house of cards, waiting to collapse if there are withdrawals, cancellations, vocal problems or what have you. Such a precarious situation is not improved by indifferent conducting and stage direction."

The meeting took place at the Altadonna Restaurant in South Ozone Park, Queens, and lasted for more than 10 hours, according to the officials. In addition to Mr. Santucci, they said, the luncheon guests included Peter Prezioso, the deputy police chief who is head of the department's intelligence division; Michael Doyle, a retired police lieutenant; Anthony Sadowski, a City Commissioner of Elections, and Salvatore Reale, who has been linked by Federal law-enforcement officials to the Gambino crime family."

Mrs. Guerrero, 25 years old, recalled today how the 28-foot wooden boat swamped within sight of shore Monday night when the captain veered away after he saw what he believed was the light of a police car on land. ''We did not have any trouble in the ocean because the waves were not high,'' said Mrs. Guerrero at the police station in the west coast city of Mayaguez in Puerto Rico where she was being detained until she could be turned over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. ''We were coming into a beach during the night when the captain thought he saw the light of a police car on shore,'' she said. ''There was a lot of confusion on the boat because some people wanted to turn around and go back because we would be arrested, but others wanted us to land because we had not eaten since we left Punta Junillo,'' the departure point in the Dominican Republic."

She had been invited - at her own request - to view firsthand some of the astonishing experiments of the society's members. The gentlemen liquified a leg of mutton, mixed cold ingredients to produce hot and performed other wonders, but the real attraction was the Duchess. Among the curiosity-seekers straining to see her was Samuel Pepys, who wrote in his diary that the Duchess of Newcastle's dress was so eccentric and her ''deportment so unordinary'' that he decided he did not like her at all."

The house, a graceful 19th-century villa of 14 rooms surrounded by a large tree-filled garden, belongs to the City of Paris. Although he refuses to say how much he is paying, Mr. Fayed calls it ''a peppercorn rent.'' The City of Paris is equally taciturn. Bernard Niquet, a city official, said, ''The city rented the house to Mr. Fayed because it was absolutely neccessary that it remain a private residence and be well kept up.''"

New Jersey's mass-transit agency, N.J. Transit, paid about $55,000 for each bus, a markdown from the $100,000 or so the Transit Authority had paid and the $140,000 a new Model 870 costs.

It was a far cry from the scene a week ago, when hundreds of peddlers of scarves, trinkets, watches, jewelry and wind-up toys jammed the sidewalks and caused some of the most powerful merchants on Fifth Avenue to complain publicly to Mayor Koch. The merchants called the spread of illegal peddlers along the elegant avenue ''a disaster.''"

Known simply as the Fort Bliss Exchange, the store is part of the nation's 10th-largest retailer, but it is a store that most shoppers can never enter.

According to David Bodanis, a British science writer, that seemingly sedate structure of brick, wood or stucco shimmers, breathes, melts, hisses and otherwise is often up to no good. His book ''The Secret House: 24 Hours in the Strange and Unexpected World in Which We Spend Our Nights and Days'' (Simon & Schuster, $18.95) zooms in relentlessly on the mundane matters of modern life, proving once again that the difference between the ordinary and the exotic is only your point of view.

The rise in short-term rates, however, did not spill over into certificates of deposit or money market accounts, which were unchanged to slightly lower. Treasury bill rates, often used as a benchmark for rates on bank money market accounts or certificates of deposit, were little changed last week, even though some other rates rose because of unusual year-end financings."

The mixed vocal quartet (Lise Messier, Wanda Brister, Gregory Mercer and John Arbo) and its director-accompanist, Raymond Beegle, ranged widely in language, style and period; the piano was big and grand; there was no fire.

1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"When Pope John Paul II travels the globe, it is in the squalid slums of the third world that his message seems most urgent and compelling. During a visit to Guyaquil, Ecuador, last year, he dropped in on El Guasmo, a sprawling collection of tin and bamboo shacks where the streets are usually nothing but mud and where several hundred thousand people often lack the most basic necessities, including drinkable water. In his address to the relatively small crowd that came to hear him, John Paul sounded like no one so much as Eugene V. Debs, the American Socialist who once said he was not free as long as someone was in prison. ''May no one feel tranquil,'' the Pope thundered, ''while in Ecuador there is a child without school, a family without a home, a worker without a job, an ill or elderly person without adequate attention.'' In El Guasmo, tranquillity is a long way off."

But from Alabama to South Carolina, moisture levels in farm fields and pastures remain well below normal, with the start of spring planting only three months off. That means farmers in the region are now hoping for a rainier than usual winter to restore the deep soil moisture that agricultural experts say is needed to nourish next season's corn, wheat and other crops and to restore pastures burned out by last summer's hot, dry weather. All across the South, heavy rains throughout October and November, and again this week, helped soak fields, although the moisture came too late to save most crops, already damaged beyond salvation by drought."
1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: The original compact was simple enough: a free credit card and a grace period between purchase and settlement dates. Then came innovations, among them an annual user fee, a penalty fee for months when the user left no unpaid balance on which a finance charge could accrue, the ''average daily balance'' and other exotic formulas for increasing the finance charge on unpaid balances, the unconscionably high interest rates. The latest innovation among banks and other credit-card issuers (''Credit Cards: No 'Free Ride,' '' Your Money column, Nov. 29), is to eliminate the grace period altogether. This development and the new tax rules, which eliminate deductibility on credit-card interest, suggest that for many of us the credit card may have outlived its usefulness. It has become an unnecessarily expensive way to do business, burdening as it does each transaction with a hefty surcharge to feed the appetite of a hungry servicing apparatus."
1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: With the recent visit to the White House by the Zairian President, Mobutu Sese Seko, the debate on whether or not to continue American aid to Zaire in light of President Mobutu's alleged human-rights abuses has again come to the fore (news story, Dec. 11). It is a debate without proper focus, conveniently ignoring the truly difficult problems that confront Zairians. The primary object for participants in this debate is the American link to an unsavory third-world dictator. Rhetoric that excoriates Zaire's ruler invites dangerous comparisons with Ferdinand E. Marcos and Jean-Claude Duvalier. Zaire is neither the Philippines nor Haiti; in the most basic sense, it is barely a nation."

The question before the Fed is whether banks should be permitted to underwrite commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities and municipal revenue bonds. The banks are partway toward achieving that goal. On Tuesday, a Federal appeals court reversed a lower court's ruling and said that the Bankers Trust Company of New York might place commercial paper, short-term corporate debt. That means that Bankers Trust may line up buyers of commercial paper, but not actually own the securities."

The report showed that while stiffer penalties for driving while drunk reduce the number of alcohol-related automobile accidents, they cause more hit-and-run accidents involving motorists who are intoxicated. ''Because the chances of paying a fine and going to jail are much greater, drivers who risk drinking are more likely to want to escape from the scene,'' said John R. Umbeck, a professor of economics at Purdue's Krannert School of Management who is co-author of the report."
1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Walking by the windows of Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City, I was swept into the crowd admiring the cozy picture of an ideal Christmas in the Lapland home of the reindeer, complete with the cherubic figures of Ricka, Flicka and Dicka, snuggled in native Scandinavian finery, and two reindeer standing as testimonials to the magnanimity of Santa Claus. Despite the joyful homeyness of the scene, I could not help being reminded of the reserve of Santa's reindeer that is rapidly being depleted in Lapland because of the trail of contaminating radiation wrought by the Chernobyl nuclear-plant accident that took place this year in the Soviet Union. How sad it is that not even the cheerful sight of such a quaint Christmas scene can remain untarnished by the technological ''advances'' that threaten our very existence.

The statement marked the first time that an Administration source had put a dollar figure on the amount of money thought to have been raised for the rebels, known as contras, from private and non-American government donors. The $20 million would come atop money apparently diverted from profits from arms sales to Iran, a figure that has been variously estimated at $10 million to $30 million. The estimate of $10 million from Brunei is significantly more than initially suspected by Congressional investigators. One Congressional official familiar with this estimate said today it was ''much more than we had previously heard about.''"
1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Gerald R. Ford's Presidency took on an element of immediacy here the other day as a high school social studies class viewed footage of the fall of Vietnam, from refugees in the countryside to the havoc at the United States Embassy as the last evacuation helicopter pulled away from the roof. Soon after, several students watched scenes of President John F. Kennedy as he traveled the country lobbying for his economic and social programs. Those images, among more than 2,235 bits of footage from 1893 to 1985, are stored on 36 silver disks that comprise the Video Encyclopedia of the 20th Century - one of the country's newest educational tools. The students in Stephen J. Paskiewicz's 11th grade class at Riverhead High School are among the first in the region to have access to the encyclopedia, according to the Manhattan-based company that produced it, CEL Educational Resources. Mr. Paskiewicz praised the encyclopedia as a research device that ''helps get kids to think critically, analyze and draw their own conclusions.'' #77 Hours of Film ''Kids are programmed into music and audio-visual entertainment,'' he said, ''but this isn't entertainment, it's history.''"

Mario Soliz Vargas, the energetic public relations man at city hall, says the setting is ''close to the sky and near the angels.'' People describing other aspects of Potosi are far less lyrical. The Rev.

1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Neil Simon is hardly Norman Rockwell, but his ''Brighton Beach Memoirs'' has a warmly nostalgic quality, something that has traveled very nicely to the screen. ''Brighton Beach Memoirs,'' the first and perhaps the most sweetly rueful play of Mr. Simon's autobiographical trilogy, has become a film of surprisingly gentle charms. Mr. Simon's humor is much in evidence, but it is not the film's strongest selling point. Even more effective are the sense of a place and a way of life long vanished and the care and affection with which they have been summoned up. ''Brighton Beach Memoirs,'' which opens today at the Paramount and other theaters, is Mr. Simon's first portrait of the young would-be writer Eugene Jerome, and of the family life whose very closeness is a touching anachronism. The play is set in 1937, in a house small enough to insure that no one ever, under any circumstances, is afforded one shred of privacy. There, Eugene (Jonathan Silverman) is experiencing the libidinous throes of adolescence. His changing behavior is closely observed by his hardworking, hard-worrying mother (Blythe Danner); by the older brother (Brian Drillinger), who's forced to share a room with him (''If I was your sister, I wouldn't sleep on the same block with you,'' this brother declares.), and even by his discouraged, exhausted father (Bob Dishy), who holds down two jobs and movingly embodies the film's Depression-era ethos."

1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"THIS may have been one of the largest years for corporate takeovers on record, but it was also the year of the broken deal. Time and again when a company seemed like a goner, it either bought off a corporate raider with the equivalent of greenmail or decided at the last minute that there was a better alternative to getting hitched. As these stocks plummet, shareholders usually wonder if their management did the right thing and question if they will ever see such lofty heights again. The Beneficial Corporation's rejection of a $1.74 billion takeover by the Transamerica Corporation last week was an especially bitter pill for some of its shareholders because the stock at one point had run up more than 25 points from the mid-40's level on the anticipation of a done deal. Yesterday the stock closed at $54.25, down 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange."

Gathering up 18 girls, she started the Girl Scouts. Since then, the organization has grown to more than two million girls, sold countless mint-chocolate cookies, offered its aid in two world wars and dropped merit badges in sick-nursing in favor of those in computers. It has seen its membership rise and fall and has had to confront issues such as drug use and child abuse, but has never lost the spunky ''can do'' spirit of its somewhat eccentric founder.

That night McKegney scored twice and the Rangers beat Los Angeles by a goal. And two nights ago, after the Devils had scored three times to draw even, McKegney went out, scored twice, and the Rangers won. Still, afterward, as if looking the other way, a Ranger player said that one of his Christmas wishes was for a high-scoring teammate. Taking what they do have for granted or perhaps conditioned to yearning, always yearning, the Rangers may have missed their Christmas present arriving early and slipping through a side door."

Since everything else makes sense, we accept the film's incredible premise and move on. Other films begin so mysteriously that the audience can't tell right away what's possible or impossible. ''The Morning After,'' Sidney Lumet's entertaining new romantic thriller, opens by challenging the audience. It says, in effect, believe this or not: Early one morning a beautiful woman, who turns out to be Alex Sternbergen (Jane Fonda), comes to hazy consciousness in a niftily modern Los Angeles loft apartment, sharing a bed with a man she doesn't know and, under the circumstances, never will. He's dead, with a large kitchen knife stuck into his chest. There's blood all over him and, very quickly, all over Alex. What would you do if you were Alex? Have hysterics? Call the cops? Flee? Alex pours herself a drink, then dresses. She's so adept that, though her hands are bloodied, she doesn't get a spot on her clothes. She can't call the cops, we eventually learn, because she was once booked for assault with a deadly weapon."

Suppose we settle for the crimson curtains, does that mean switching from the forest green carpet? Who color-coordinates their garden in the way they would a room? Scarcely anybody. Why? Mostly, I believe, because they feel it is beyond their competence. Fabrics and paint are known quantities.

Preparations are made in homes and churches and shops in every city and town, and the land is full of traditional signs and symbols of its coming: Fresh snow resting lightly on the holly bush, package-laden crowds crushing the storefronts and bus stops, strings of lights gleaming from the housetops, chestnut vendors and street-corner Santas, school plays with children dressed -hardly needing the costume - as angels, and choirs joining heart and voice in joyous song. Because of these traditions, no Christmas celebration truly stands alone. For most of us, the holidays bring back such a trove of memories, evoked by things as simple as the scent of pine or the painted scene on a greeting card, that our Christmases become not separate events on a calendar but a chain in which all are linked together as one. This is as it should be, for Christmas is a holiday that we celebrate not as individuals nor as a nation but as a human family - and not merely as a family living in this age and time but as a family linked through history, in ways we still cannot fully comprehend, to that first Christmas in Bethlehem. May our prayers this Christmas call forth that serenity of heart and confidence in the future that are the best of all possible gifts. May the song of our people be one of thanks for God's blessings on America and of petition for His continued blessings upon us, especially on those who face this Christmas in want or loneliness."

As all my students in Philosophy 1510 know, it was David Hume, in his ''Autobiography,'' discussing his own poorly received ''Treatise of Human Nature,'' not Descartes, who wrote that the book ''fell dead-born from the press, without reaching such distinction, as even to excite a murmur among the zealots.''"

Hardwoods like maple, oak and elm - trees that lose their leaves in the fall - give off the most heat and burn longer than softwoods, like spruce and pine, which are easier to ignite. The Wood Heating Alliance in Washington recommends burning a mixture of hardwoods and softwoods for the best fire - one that is easily ignited and long-lasting."

The problem of noise pollution has been heightened by the increasing number of television sets, stereos, radios and other audible appliances in homes and apartments. Many homes are more compact and better insulated than ever before, so internal noises are more confined and often exaggerated."
1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"FRANK NORRIS: Novels and Essays. Edited by Donald Pizer. 1,232 pages. Library of America. $27.50. There is a fairly straight line in the American naturalistic novel from Frank Norris to Theodore Dreiser to John Steinbeck. Some of the themes they tackled through their characters first appeared in nonfiction form at the turn of the century, when the muckraking magazine journalists examined the excesses of various industries, from the stockyards to the oilfields. Looking at the popular books published today, it's hard to imagine that powerful works of fiction and fact that exposed unsafe conditions in the mines or the travails of migratory workers once led to legislative changes. Few modern novelists grapple with such issues affecting everyday lives in the manner of the influential naturalists; when they sometimes attempt to do so, critics with narrow historical vision reproach these authors (or dramatists or scenarists) and brand their work agitprop. One need hardly add: how shortsighted and discouraging to present-day writers who have something significant to say."

The victim, Cedric Sandiford of Brooklyn, also failed to appear at the 106th precinct in Ozone Park, Queens, on Monday to view a lineup. Officials said his absence contributed to the release of eight of the teen-agers who had been questioned in the attack. The purpose of the subpoena, according to aides of District Attorney John J. Santucci, was to get Mr. Sandiford to review the case with prosecutors before a preliminary hearing Monday for three white teen-agers who are charged with second-degree murder in the attack. The three, all of Queens, are Jon L. Lester, 17 years old, of 81-17 149th Avenue, Ozone Park, and Scott Kern, 17, of 87-14 158th Avenue, and Jason Ladone, 16, of 161-23 89th Street, both of Howard Beach."

Fumiya Iwasaki, the deputy director general of the ministry's international finance bureau, said the loans would be used to aid developing nations and debtor countries that want to rebuild their economies. With the announcement, Japan hoped to ward off further criticism that it has been stingy with aid for developing nations, despite its huge trade surplus - which is estimated to exceed $94 billion next spring. When Japan has given aid in the past, critics have charged, it has attached conditions that have meant, in practice, that countries receiving the aid had to buy Japanese products or offer contracts to Japanese companies. 6 Percent Average Interest Japan is lending $3.6 billion to the International Monetary Fund over a four-year period beginning in June 1987. The loan will be used within developing nations and as a reserve fund for the I.M.F. The expected average interest rate on these loans, Mr. Iwasaki said, will be about 6 percent.

Torres is under attack for various decisions he has made in recent weeks in response to controversies arising from the World Boxing Association heavyweight match in which James (Bonecrusher) Smith won the title from Tim Witherspoon on Dec. 12. As a professional fighter from 1958 to 1969, Torres had his share of problems from the politics that have undercut the sport in virtually every era. Torres, who fought first as a middleweight and later as a light heavyweight, was 26-0-1 in his first five years as a pro. Yet his way to a title shot was blocked because the fighter's manager, Cus D'Amato - the same man who guided Floyd Patterson and later Mike Tyson - was often at odds with the boxing establishment, including the International Boxing Club, an organization that eventually was declared in violation of antitrust law."

''The Rise'' was originally a book written in 1917, in English, by Abraham Cahan, an immigrant newspaperman who made The Jewish Daily Forward the leading Yiddish periodical. Mr. Sheffer translated the Levinsky story into a theatrical musical, with Bobby Paul writing the music, and they finished in 1975. A year later, translated into Yiddish by Zvi Scooler, it made a successful appearance with the Folksbiene Theater. In 1983, it was even more successful in its native tongue, English, in a lively production by the American Jewish Theater at the 92nd Street Y. The authors did further work on the piece, and it was presented last April at the George Street Theater.

The Episcopal Bishop of New York, Paul Moore Jr., was not without hope in the sermon he prepared for delivery at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.

This is the period when the critic is working - a task that doesn't preclude pleasure, as some critic-critics presume, but working nonetheless - to form an initial opinion. Then the album enters a larval stage from which it may or may not emerge. If it does not, it dies - the record is dispensed with to make room for more records or the significant other's potted plant. Or it is neatly filed away, ready for reference but otherwise ignored. This state is known to Dracula fans as the ''undead.'' The record is still in the critic's possession, but it no longer does what records do for ordinary people, which is periodically to get played and provide pleasure."

Dr. Sakharov, who granted brief interviews to separate groups of Western news agency reporters today, told The Associated Press that he had ''great respect'' for the new Soviet leader.

Opium at that time in Germany was known mostly as a painkiller; Marx's point was that religion deceptively eased the painful symptoms of the exploitation of labor by capital. To bring on the revolution, religion's succor had to be removed, allowing the working class to suffer until the pain was intolerable; at that point, the permanent cure would come from Communism. Marx made that a top priority: ''the first requisite for the people's happiness is the abolition of religion.''"

''At that point, the coach's responsibility is to the entire team,'' Mackovic said today in a telephone news conference, reflecting on that move in the seventh game of the season.

Sources here say the Arabs were Moslem fundamentalist opponents of the Syrian Government of President Hafez al-Assad. Some sources here close to French intelligence said the arrests might have paved the way for the release of Aurel Cornea, 54 years old, a French television journalist, after 292 days of detention. Mr. Cornea was held by a group calling itself the Revolutionary Justice Organization, which French Government analysts believe to be close to Syria."

Addressing the dignitaries and pilgrims gathered around him, as well as ''our brothers and sisters to whom this solemn rite is being transmitted by radio and television,'' the Pope said, ''The event of Bethlehem night unites us all.'' John Paul's global audience is at its peak with his Christmas midnight mass, which is broadcast more widely than any other papal event."
1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Finally, Naomi Miller says, she approached her Christmas shopping with something resembling relief. ''For the first time in his life, my son isn't screaming for something all his friends have that I can't find,'' she said earlier this week while waiting at the F.A.O. Schwarz cash register to buy some ''good old-fashioned toys'' - an Erector Set and a toy truck -which 5-year-old Andrew will find under the tree this morning. Santa's list was longer and more diverse this year, toy makers, retailers and shoppers say. Business was as good as ever, but no single hot toy, no unobtainable but have-to-have gift, sent frantic mothers and fathers scrambling from one emporium to another."
1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Chuck Foster says he's just trying to give Everyman the chance for a little recognition. He must be trying hard, because the truth is that he has built an entire career on that notion, organizing strange sporting events with big-time trappings for ''the masses, the un-jocks who aren't normally catered to.'' The 42-year-old Foster, who wears combat fatigues and enjoys zipping around southern California in a jeep fitted with emergency lights, started his career as an impresario of the slightly weird when he was an officer for the Sheriff's Department in Ventura, Calif. There he organized the Pig Bowl, a football game between policemen and prisoners that served as the model for ''The Longest Yard,'' the Burt Reynolds movie. In 1969, he promoted a motorcycle competition for riders who had never before won a race, and handed out trophies to more than 1,000 participants. Among the goofy games that followed were the U.S. Toobing Olympics, contested on a river by teams of 10 men and women in inner tubes, and the Natural Light Championship Salad Toss-Off."
1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"A flood of immigrants from Hong Kong has pushed commercial rents in New York's Chinatown up to the levels of midtown, making the real estate in one untidy corner of Manhattan among the most expensive in the United States. The demand for space is so strong, local real estate brokers say, that the operators of vegetable stalls near the bustling intersection of Catherine and Division Streets pay more rent per square foot than the owners of Tiffany & Company at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. City officials describe the frenzy in the Chinatown real estate market as ''hysteria.'' ''Everytime you turn around the prices have shot up again,'' said Michael Dirzulaitis, an assistant commissioner in the city's Division of Real Property, which has been involved in several development projects in Chinatown this year. ''It's hard to believe that there is enough money around to keep it going, but there is.''"

The plastic on the top meets the plastic laminate along the edge in a neat angle, but this edge has developed very small chips and one or two small cracks. I fear a cloth may catch on a nick and then tear a larger piece of the plastic laminate. Is there a sealant to prevent this? A.This corner should have been beveled slightly to prevent the chipping. Sharp corners or edges can still be smoothed or beveled with a file, but stroke downward only and use a mill file (made for use on metal), not a rasp or coarse file."

Republic is paying about $80 million for Williamsburgh, a mutually owned savings institution that now is ailing but that for years was one of New York City's most successful home lenders. It has $2.2 billion in assets. Completion of the takeover appears virtually assured. The boards of both organizations have given informal approval and regulators are likely to support the deal because of Williamsburgh's poor financial condition caused by high interest rates in the early part of the decade."
1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"When the holiday season rolls around and talk of miracles is in the air, Mickey Lolich sometimes remembers a boy named Vince, and wonders what happened to him. In fact, the thought of Lolich was triggered by the arrival recently of the ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame. One of the names on it for the third straight year - he has received only a modest number of votes in the past - is Mickey Lolich, who pitched for 16 years in the big leagues, mostly with the Detroit Tigers. Besides having won 25 games in one season, and having started, completed and won three games in the 1968 World Series - in the seventh game he defeated Bob Gibson and the Cardinals, 4-1, and was named the most valuable player in the Series -besides all that, Mickey Lolich stood out because, from the neck down, he looked like Santa Claus in a baseball uniform."

Last month her Government signed a cease-fire with Communist rebels, who started their insurgency in 1969, and she said today that it was preparing for talks next month to end a 14-year-old Moslem revolt. Mrs. Aquino directed her Christmas message to all ''those who have not yet joined; those who harbor anger and hate; those who refuse to have hope in what we offer; those who remain indifferent and cynical of all our efforts.''"

The water had come through the floorboards in volumes -close to 100 gallons an hour. Jeantot knew he had had a problem. But when he saw the underside of his boat, he found out how serious it was."

1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"A COUPLE of times a year, often before the start of the heating and air-conditioning seasons, residential customers of utilities receive bill inserts urging them to schedule a home-energy audit. These notices are often ignored because many people are unaware of what an audit entails or why they might need one. According to Federal and state energy officials and utility representatives, it is never too late to take advantage of the service, which they say can shave hundreds of dollars a year off energy bills. ''The point of the energy audit is to give people a sense of what they can do and how to gain energy benefits,'' said Sam Swanson, an expert in energy conservation and environmental analysis for New York State. ''There are some real opportunities for people to save a lot of money.''"
1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"The disclosures of arms shipments to Iran and the diversion of funds to the Nicaraguan rebels have created a fundamental problem for Vice President Bush in his effort to succeed President Reagan, aides and other supporters said today. The problem, they said, is that much of his strategy has turned on his loyalty to Mr. Reagan, which advisers have said is important among the conservatives who will be influential in nominating the Republican Presidential candidate. The disclosures have threatened to undermine that strategy, some of his advisers acknowledged, and have caused a precipitate drop in his poll ratings among Republicans. The aides, who discussed the situation on the condition that their names be withheld, said Mr. Bush, out of loyalty to Mr. Reagan, has placed himself in a precarious situation by rejecting any suggestion that he distance himself from the President over the Iran affair. In effect, the aides said, he is gambling that the public clamor will subside."
1986-12-25T00:00:00Z,"If Rube Goldberg had invented an energy policy, it might have looked like fuel economy standards for automobiles. These are so clumsy that most economists and other believers in free-market incentives cheered this week when the Reagan Administration proposed to abolish them after 11 years. But before this unloved regulatory program is dumped by acclaim, it's worth asking what Washington would substitute as a defense against OPEC extortion. There's one thing worse than a fuel economy policy: no policy at all, and so far, that's all the Administration offers."

How important is an audience's image of an actress to its acceptance of her in a role? Will viewers believe that a woman with the back muscles of Jane Fonda has lived a profligate and degenerate life? Sidney Lumet, the film's director, said he never considered Ms. Fonda's image a problem. ''In this instance,'' he said, ''I wasn't even aware of it. I'm not really aware of that whole world.'' He pointed out that the film's first scene was of a television program showing women pumping iron. ''Jane said we can't use that, people will think it's a commercial,'' he said. ''But I didn't agree with her.'' ''Basically,'' Mr. Lumet said, ''I think that if an actress or actor begins with a strong persona but is a very good performer, which Jane is, as soon as the acting begins that persona disappears in an instant.'' The film, he said, is one that Ms. Fonda developed and sent to him for the first time about four years ago. ''There was something in it that really interested her,'' he said, ''and we wanted to work together for a long time.''"

Clubs around town are teeming with talent. Rising young stars like the singer Laurie Beechman and the comedian Bob Nelson refresh a genre that sometimes seems to languish on the brink of extinction. At the same time, persevering veterans like Anita Ellis and Jon Hendricks continue to define unshakeably high standards of excellence in a different mode of jazz singing. Laurie Beechman, who is currently starring on Broadway as Grizabella in the musical ''Cats,'' has been appearing off and on in New York clubs since she arrived here from Philadelphia in the mid-1970's. Her current appearance at the Ballroom, 253 West 28th Street, is the first local club date in four years by a singer who has steadily grown in power and command to become the best young emotive belter in the dramatic tradition of Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand."

Tambs, as well as other officials in the American Embassy in Costa Rica, maintained close contact with others involved in a so-called private supply network for the rebels that was set up by Lieut.

The Lubavitch Hasidim who put up the menorah say that it is the biggest one in the world.

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: The system of criminal sentencing that has prevailed in the United States for most of this century has been called, in the recent past, lawless, inhumane and a national disgrace. After many years of trying to come to terms with the problems that produce such reactions, states across the country and Congress passed laws to move from a system of indeterminate, often unpredictable sentencing to one with more coherence and predictability. The effort at the national level is in the hands of the Sentencing Commission, charged by Congress with designing and implementing the new sentencing system. The work of that commission is at a critical stage, when clarity and public understanding are most important. I'm afraid, however, that David Anderson's Editorial Notebook may have caused confusion and incited needless disquiet."

Already, elected officials from the area are trying to alert the rest of the state to the emerging political realities of a gambling capital with a number of strong grievances against state regulators. The casino workers' political strength will be tested in coming months as a number of bills to lighten the state's regulatory hand are introduced in the Legislature. ''A lot of people go to Atlantic City for the day and then go home, and they don't understand the politics of the situation down there anymore,'' said Assemblyman Rodney P.

Mr. Maddox said Mr. Santucci did not return his calls. Mr. Santucci said that he had called back, but that Mr. Maddox had not been in his office. Mr. Santucci also said the lawyer had not responded to repeated messages left with Mr. Maddox's secretary.

The new profit policy ''is completely out of step with the realities and the economics of the defense industry,'' officials of five industry groups said in comments filed Wednesday in response to the Pentagon rules. The rules, which were developed over two years and published Dec. 1, alter in several ways the complex formulas used by the military to set profit objectives in negotiating contracts that are awarded noncompetitively. Competitive contracts are handled differently, on the premise that prices and profits will be kept low because of competition."

Nine hours later, the fighting died down and the leader of the new regime, Babrak Karmal, addressed our nation. Two days later, the K.G.B. began establishing secret prisons throughout the country. President Karmal declared that all political prisoners would be freed.

The inability of Edwin J. Gray to muster support from the agency's two other members, both Reagan appointees, may have even neutralized his tough regulatory stance on the industry's widespread problems, some experts said. In the agency's packed boardroom last Thursday, Mr. Gray had argued for a two-year extension of a measure limiting direct investment in real estate ventures to 10 percent of a thrift institution's assets. But after two hours of debate, he lamented: ''Ladies and gentlemen, there has been some consultation as to where the various board members are coming out.

This year, New Year's Eve ''weekend'' embodies a crescendo of six days of festivities that culminates in that ultimate witching hour: midnight, Dec. 31. In addition to the plethora of public celebrations in nightclubs, hotel ballrooms and restaurants, New York City offers a remarkable assortment of ways to enjoy a holiday period that embraces 6 of the 12 days of Christmas, Hanukkah, the African festival known as Kwanza and New Year's Eve itself. Music will resound from concert halls, churches, parks and even a barge in Brooklyn. Fireworks will bedazzle millions of bleary midnight eyes near the South Street Seaport and Central and Prospect Parks.

Despite the director, the commercials, which were written by Long, Haymes & Carr of Winston-Salem, are not funny, nor were they intended to be. But they seem effective."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"HE is a ubiquitous and, at 6 feet 6 inches tall, a looming figure in the New York art world today. His frequent presence at blue-chip functions is no surprise, however, given his multiple roles as a private collector of 20th-century art, the founder of a major corporate art collection, and, for the past year, president of the Board of Trustees of the Museum of Modern Art. He is Donald B. Marron, and for a full-time job, he is chairman and chief executive officer of the Paine Webber Group Inc., one of the world's largest financial service and brokerage concerns. Now at the one-year mark in his post at the Modern, Mr. Marron spoke recently in his midtown office about his hopes for that museum, about his corporate collection and the business-art connection."

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"Allegations that shoddy workmanship and drug and alcohol abuse were jeopardizing safety at the Seabrook nuclear power plant either brought remedies or were unsubstantiated, a Federal report said. But a member of the House involved in a separate inquiry condemned the report, by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, saying the findings made the agency appear to swallow the plant management's story ''hook, line and sinker.'' The report, released Wednesday, followed a commission investigation of charges by the Massachusetts-based Employees Legal Project of drug or alcohol abuse among some construction workers at the $5 billion plant, which is completed but not yet operating. The group submitted a list of 61 possible safety problems."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"Vietnamese Roman Catholics, embroiled in a bitter dispute with the Diocese of San Jose over demands for their own parish, rented a high school to ''pray for reconciliation'' with church officials on Christmas Eve. The service came two and a half weeks after the diocese suspended masses in the Vietnamese language when protests and scuffles broke out at two churches. Bai An Tran, a leader of the dissidents in the nation's third largest Vietnamese community, said his group invited Bishop Pierre DuMaine and other church officials to the service. Bishop DuMaine, who opposes the creation of a separate Vietnamese parish because, he says, the community is not independent enough and cannot afford to maintain its own church, declined to attend the service."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"IN ''Therese,'' the French director Alain Cavalier's detached, elegantly photographed depiction of the life and death of a young Carmelite nun in the late 19th century, Catherine Mouchet radiates a striking mixture of beatified radiance, obsession and stubbornness. Throughout the movie, which was shot in a diorama rather than on a conventional set, the Carmelite nuns emerge before the camera and recede like translucent apparitions in a 19th-century French painting. Perhaps the one image from the picture that sticks the most is Ms. Mouchet's enigmatic gaze, avid with expectation at the beginning of the film, when she is a 15-year-old burning to become a saint, and anguished but still burning at the end of the movie, when she is near death from tuberculosis. In life, Ms. Mouchet is as much of an enigma as in the film. During a recent interview, she declined to talk about her personal life beyond the bare facts that she is 27 - three years older than Therese at the end of the movie - and Parisian. The director himself has said that Ms. Mouchet, whose performance in ''Therese'' has won critical acclaim, would not answer when he asked precise questions about her origins and religious orientation."

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"Democrats and Republicans have good reason for sitting on different sides of the aisle in the Senate chamber. Political considerations so infect every decision on Capitol Hill that it takes an unusual issue to bring lawmakers together on a genuinely bipartisan basis. But one topic that has the power to bridge the gap of party rivalry is arms control. And for more than three years now, two Republican Senators and two Democrats have been working closely together on a single goal: pressuring the Administration into adhering to the strategic arms limitation treaty signed with the Soviets in the 1970's. Although the treaty was never approved by the Senate, Washington and Moscow agreed to abide by its key provisions anyway."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"The Reagan Administration says it will propose new regulations early next year to crack down on many personal long-distance calls made by Federal workers at Government expense. At the same time, the draft regulations would redefine what constitutes abuse so that ''reasonable'' but unofficial calls would be permitted, according to Joseph M. Slye, a spokesman for the General Services Administraton. The Office of Personnel Management, in a study requested by the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, found recently that 36.5 percent of long-distance calls were not for official Government business."

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"The 15,811 fans drawn to Madison Square Garden yesterday were no doubt expecting and even rooting for a Michael Jordan spectacular. What they got was an awesome 28-point, 17-rebound performance from Patrick Ewing that included the winning basket in an 86-85 Knick victory over the Chicago Bulls. With six seconds remaining and the Bulls leading, 85-84, thanks to a 3-point play by Dave Corzine, the Knicks called time and designed a play for Trent Tucker to take the final shot behind a Ewing pick. Tucker Misses Louis Orr passed the ball inbounds to Tucker, who planted his feet just inside the 3-point shootng area and got off a shot within 2 seconds. The ball hit the left side of the rim but took a long bounce toward the middle, skimmed off Jordan's fingers and headed toward Ewing, who was wide open. Corzine, his man, had left him and jumped out to contest Tucker's shot."

Worries have intensified among economists and business executives that another breakdown in the system could happen. Yet, paradoxically, the securities markets remain strong, reflecting the widespread belief of investors that solutions can and will be found to the dangers that lie ahead. But skeptics may retort that stock market confidence also reached a high in 1929, just before the crash."

In recent years, it has alternated between blue and gray. James C. Miller 3d, director of the Office of Management and Budget, suggested to reporters this week that the color had some symbolic value. Mr. Miller said maroon ''consists of the colors red and black'' and then added somewhat optimistically, ''This is a budget that is red but turning black.''"

The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Dr. Frank Young, ruled that applying the agency's regulations for good manufacturing practices to the nation's 1,400 dialysis clinics ''would set a major precedent in terms of F.D.A. regulating medical practice,'' according to an agency report to field offices released Wednesday. The petition filed last spring by Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and five other panel members, asked the drug agency to promulgate new regulations for the reuse of kidney dialysis filters and tubes. It also called for controlled clinical studies to determine if reuse was a safe practice.

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"A memo book that Jennifer Levin kept in the kitchen of her family's SoHo home has become the center of a bitter, but subtle legal debate among prosecutors, defense attorneys and legal scholars. The dispute concerns whether the diary of Miss Levin, who was killed last August in Central Park, should be turned over for use in the defense of the man accused of murdering her, 20-year-old Robert E. Chambers Jr. His lawyer, Jack T. Litman, has argued that the diary is crucial to Mr. Chambers's defense because it contains the names of Miss Levin's previous sex partners and ''chronicles'' her sexual activity. Mr. Chambers has said he killed Miss Levin accidentally while the two were having sex in the park."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"The United States cannot guarantee victory to the Afghan freedom fighters, but it can help deny victory to the Soviet Union. Washington must make Moscow want out. The key is to convince the Russians that the continuing costs of the war - military, political and economic - outweigh the potential gains. Only then will they seek a negotiated withdrawal. Moscow has steadily escalated its military activities, incurring mounting casualties and killing almost one million Afghans since Soviet tanks rolled into Kabul on Dec. 27, 1979. It has also made cosmetic changes in the Quisling Communist regime in Kabul, but it is no closer to winning today than it was in 1979. Far from giving up, however, the Russians are settling in for the long haul, threatening to defeat the resistance in a grinding war of attrition."

But when your chums include the likes of Licia Albanese, Margaret Whiting, Julie Wilson, David Susskind, Taina Elg, Al Hirschfeld, Charles Strouse and Carmen, the model, even a prima ballerina is going to have a bit of competition.

The village is not much to look at: a single main street of low, stone shops on a rise in the rocky, barren hills. But near the only gas station there is an imposing abstract monument with a bas-relief of the flag of the ruling Baath Party thrust into a map of the Arab world with Syria at its heart. And a couple of blocks away, behind a high yellow wall, guarded by troops in the reddish tiger-stripe camouflage and burnt orange berets of an elite unit, stands the opulent palace of Qardaha's favorite son, President Hafez al-Assad."

Moore-Ede of Harvard Medical School. Occasionally, everyone in the cockpit nods off at the same time while the plane flies on automatic pilot, he said. Planes have been known to cruise past their destinations as the pilots and navigator sleep, he added."

Besides providing for virtually no growth from the current year's budget, the proposed budget includes a drop of 2 percent in the important category of public works. The spending restraint could be a concern to Japan's major trading partners, especially the United States, which has urged Japan to bolster its economy to stimulate demand for American goods.

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"When the Federal Government began a program last spring to slaughter dairy cows in a move to reduce milk production in the United States, a small, nonprofit agency here decided that it was a waste of a valuable resource. Thus was born the ''Save the Cows'' program of Heifer Project International, an agricultural development agency that has been donating livestock to the needy around the world since 1944. Under the program, cows facing slaughter as part of the Federal Government's Dairy Termination Program to reduce the nation's surplus of dairy products are being shipped to low-income families in other countries where milk is needed. ''When the Federal program was first introduced, farmers called us saying they had worked all their lives to breed good cattle and were distressed at having them destroyed,'' said Jerry L. Bedford, director of development for the project. ''What a dreadful waste when the rest of the world needs milk. We thought there was a better way to use these cows.'' #900,000 Cows Slaughtered Since May, 1,067 heifers, mostly Holsteins, have been shipped from farms throughout the country to small farmers in Jordon, Honduras and Mexico through the Save the Cows program. And although 900,000 cows have already been slaughtered and 47,000 more have been exported commercially under the Federal program, the project hopes to donate 2,500 heifers to underdeveloped nations by next August, said Jim Hoey, coordinator of the project."

But the 24-year-old native of the Philippines almost lost his job because of another arm of the Federal Government: the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Delays in processing Mr. Ignacio's citizenship application put him perilously close to missing a deadline to re-enlist for his second term in the Coast Guard.

However, according to a Sept. 19, 1963, news story describing the destruction of the tree, The Times reported, ''Rutgers said it could not prove that Kilmer . . . had been inspired by the oak.''

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"Among the biggest headaches suffered in the Pentagon has been the responsibility for the medical care of 10 million people in peacetime and for the wartime treatment of men and women wounded in battle. By law, the 2.2 million members of the armed forces and their 2.8 million dependents are entitled to free medical care, as are 5 million more retired military people, dependents and widows. That free medical care is a strong point used by recruiters trying to interest young people in enlisting in the armed forces. But the military system that provides peacetime medical care has been strained, Pentagon officials say. Overcrowded military hospitals try to treat 50 million outpatients a year. Costs of sending the overflow to civilian doctors and hospitals approaches $2 billion a year. And the quality of the care has been criticized in highly publicized cases of malpractice."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"FREQUENTLY it is the small detail that is bound to stick in memory. In this evening's ''Kennedy Center Honors,'' while Glenn Close and Hal Linden are singing a love ballad from the musical ''I Do, I Do,'' Nancy Reagan reaches over to hold President Reagan's hand. Not responding immediately, the uncharacteristically subdued President finally turns to the First Lady and manages a smile. A purely impulsive moment? Or the seizing of a good photo opportunity during a period of political and no doubt personal stress? Either way, the image - seen by few in the theater but now available to millions - is striking. The ninth annual broadcast of ''The Kennedy Center Honors: A Celebration of the Performing Arts'' was taped on Dec. 7 and can be seen tonight at 9 on Channel 2. Once again directed by Don Mischer, the event has evolved into one of the more consistently classy awards shows designed for television. The point is not the recognition of a single performance in a passing season. These honors, bestowed by the President in a White House ceremony, celebrate an entire career. The youngest honoree this year, Ray Charles, is 56 years old. All of the others are in their 70's: Lucille Ball, Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, Yehudi Menuhin and Antony Tudor. There are lifetimes of accomplishment here."

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"THERE are some words particularly appropriate to theater production: planned, hoped-for, scheduled and tentative are just a few. And the sad fact is that a number of planned, hoped-for, scheduled and tentative productions, announced with varying degrees of fanfare each year, fizzle before they even get near a stage. The money people bow out, Dustin Hoffman decides he doesn't want to sing and dance, Mike Nichols is busy for the next five years, the package didn't jell - name a reason, any reason, and it's bound to have been used to explain why a show that was highly touted hasn't yet seen the light of day. Which doesn't necessarily mean that silence about announced projects is a death knell. Sometimes, the postponement is actually that - raising the money took longer than expected, the star who was ready to sign didn't, the book and music needed work. And not infrequently, the project eventually does get going, or seriously looks as though it's going to get going. And sometimes while it's not really alive, it's not dead either - it's on a back burner, but the flame is still on."

The 30-year-old worker, who declined to give her name for fear of being blacklisted by employers, was used to long hours - she had worked 10-hour days, six days a week, sewing buttons on clothes for an average monthly salary of $185. But after attending evening classes at a local church, where she learned about labor organizations, she grew to believe that her employers' demands were unfair - and says she is willing to go into factories and organize strikes. ''They fired me,'' she said, ''for being an agitator.''"

Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given.

It, too, is a directory, and it seeks to list all the suppliers from whose efforts a final print ad, radio spot or TV commercial is constructed. And there are many, since advertising agencies are largely for idea generation. And their ideas are the bare bones of a concept whose finished product must be fleshed out by suppliers, such as photographers, illustrators, photofinishers, retouchers, TV directors and production houses and post-production houses and so on."

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"Cape Cod Potato Chips are not sold in many places, but in the stores that carry the product, it is frequently the top-selling chip. A thick and very crisp potato chip made by old-fashioned methods in this seaside resort town, Cape Cod Potato Chips are going the way of David's cookies, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Dove Bars and other new versions of traditional snack foods that have recently risen from the ranks of junk food to the status of ''premium'' or ''gourmet'' treats. More Expensive Than Rivals Like their counterparts in the ice cream, cookie and candy world, Cape Cod Potato Chips cost more than their competitors ($1.49 for a seven-ounce bag compared with, say, $1.29 for an eight-ounce bag of mass-produced potato chips); they are made without chemical additives (just potatoes and oil); and, to many, they taste better. John O'Shaughnessy, a consumer behavior expert at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business, says the chip company is part of a growing coterie of small food entrepreneurs tapping a special pocket of consumers willing and eager to treat themselves to a $2 piece of chocolate or $1.75 ice cream cone. ''There are a lot of little luxury segments out there,'' Professor O'Shaughnessy said, ''and big manufacturers do not cater to them. They're not big enough.''"

The discussions fell through, Wedtech officials said, when they became suspicious of the agent -who they originally thought was a wealthy Arab investor. They hired a private investigator to check out his background, and discovered his links to Iran. ''After obtaining a report on him, they concluded that his past was nefarious, that he had some contacts to Iran,'' said Wedtech's corporate counsel, Martin Pollner. ''They did not want to get involved with him. There was no contract, no deal, and nothing was ever consummated.''"
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"After five years of growing cooperation, Roman Catholic and Jewish spokesmen in Brazil have taken a new step toward eliminating generations of mutual distrust by publishing a detailed manual to promote interfaith discussion. The 187-page booklet, which was distributed this month to Brazil's 229 Catholic archdioceses and dioceses by the National Bishops' Conference, covers a broad range of subjects. These include the history of the Jewish people, the roots of anti-Semitism and the Nazi horror, Judaism in Brazil and specific ways of handling differences between the two religions. Its publication is considered significant not only because Brazil is the world's most populous Catholic country but also because, although only about 170,000 Jews live here, Brazil's bishops appear to have moved faster than the Vatican in trying to establish a closer relationship with Judaism."

That university students, the chosen young, should demonstrate in such numbers in favor of political principles closely associated in the minds of Chinese with the non-Communist West, particularly the United States, has raised disturbing questions among many here about the direction of economic and political change in China. The largest rallies were in Shanghai last weekend, where close to 50,000 people were estimated to have gathered on Sunday alone. But they also occurred in Beijing and about half a dozen other cities. Today there were reports that 3,000 students demonstrated in the port city of Tianjin to show their solidarity with the Shanghai protests."

Because everything worked out for the Giants, who won their division and are Super Bowl favorites, it just seemed hassle-free. ''I don't think you realized how concerned I was with the backfield situation early in the season,'' said Parcells, ''when Joe Morris had that allergic reaction and Lee Rouson's knees weren't doing good and we talked of ways to scope him and we didn't know about George Adams, and Maurice Carthon had a broken thumb. I was very, very concerned at that time, particularly when we went to St. Louis."

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"Richard Keating recalls with wonder those hectic days after he first moved to Houston from Chicago as a young architect in 1976. Those were days of wild Texas growth, when a 20-story building was a small job, when he and his ambitious young colleagues often worked all night, fueled on take-out pizzas and the sheer excitement of building a dazzling new city, with their dogs curled up under the drafting tables. A few months ago Mr. Keating, who cut a tall figure in Houston in his aviator glasses, 40-foot sailboat and Porsche Cabriolet, transferred to Los Angeles to take over the busy Skidmore Owings & Merrill architectural office there. Departing with him were about a dozen other architects from the Houston office who, he said, felt that they ''want to go where the action is.'' Vanguard of Outflow The group was in the vanguard of a small but growing outflow of professionals - architects, lawyers, writers, scholars, bankers - from Texas as its oil economy slows. They are part of a larger demographic shift in which, for the first time, more people are moving out of Texas than into it."

The ruling was made by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which instituted tests for some championship events and some football bowl games this year in an effort to prevent the use of more than a hundred banned generic drugs. At least six players have now been barred from bowl games because of positive drug tests, but the action on Bosworth was the most dramatic so far. He is a charismatic player, noted for his unusual hair style and his prodigious strength. He finished fourth this season in voting for the Heisman Trophy as the nation's best college football player and has been rated as one of the top prospects for the National Football League draft next spring."

The A.M.A., in a lawsuit filed Wednesday, is also seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the law's Medicare provisions from taking effect until the recipients are given more information about the changes. The provisions on Medicare, which finances health care for 28 million elderly people and 3 million disabled people, are to take effect Jan. 1, a week from today. The suit was filed by the association, which represents 272,000 physicians, and several other parties in Federal District Court in Lubbock, Tex., against Dr. Otis R.

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"The headlines about the Reagan Administration's crisis of leadership and direction have been so thick and constant that the passing of another arms control opportunity was too little noticed or mourned. On Dec. 18, Soviet officials announced that they would not continue the nuclear testing moratorium that they had maintained for 17 months, while President Reagan disingenuously refused to join; and a White House spokesman replied almost insolently that that was ''their business.'' Well, it's also the business of a lot of Americans who want a reduction in the danger of nuclear war, not just between the superpowers but among the numerous other nations that either have ''the bomb'' or can quickly develop it. These Americans believe with a power of evidence on their side that a nuclear test ban would be a useful step in the right direction."

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"''THE ADVENT OF MODERNISM: Post-Impressionism and North American Art, 1900-1918,'' currently on view at the Brooklyn Museum (200 Eastern Parkway), feels a bit like a rough draft or an outline of an exhibition that still needs to be properly filled in and shaped. Crowded into the museum's big fifth-floor rotunda, with some 125 works strung out along walls that seem to go on forever or awkwardly displayed on the space's four fat columns, it also looks like an exhibition waiting to be installed. This is not a robust show, chockablock with masterpieces. It needs the quiet intimacy of a succession of small galleries that it must have enjoyed at its point of origin, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. In Brooklyn, it is nearly done in by the space that contains it. Nonetheless, ''The Advent of Modernism'' (on view through Jan. 19) offers the first in-depth look at the earliest, which is to say the pre-Cubist, roots of Modernism on this side of the Atlantic. It shows how 54 American and Canadian artists struggled to master the lessons of late Cezanne, van Gogh, Gauguin, Seurat, the Fauves and finally early Matisse. This gamut of styles and innovations - gathered under the generous umbrella of Post-Impressionism by the British art critic Roger Fry in 1910 -initiated North American artists into the pictorial powers of stronger color, freer paint handling and increased attention to surface flatness as opposed to spatial representation."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"An Iraqi airliner was hijacked yesterday and later crashed and burned on a remote desert airstrip in Saudi Arabia, killing 62 people, Jordanian officials said. The Jordanian Government said the Iraqi Airways jetliner en route from Baghdad to Amman had been commandeered by gunmen shortly after takeoff. Witnesses said that unidentified armed men set off least one hand grenade in the cabin before the Boeing 737 hit the ground and that a fire on board spewed smoke through the cabin. One witness said that when the plane, Flight 163, hit the ground, the fuselage split apart. Emergency Landing The plane crashed during an emergency landing at Arar, 60 miles south of the Saudi-Iraqi border and 250 miles southwest of Baghdad in northern Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Defense Ministry said."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"For a beleaguered state like Israel, arms exports are a tempting way to seek foreign friends, earn money and promote military self-sufficiency. So tempting that, remarkably, Israel has by some estimates climbed to ninth place in the world's arms bazaar, with annual sales of $1.2 billion or nearly a fourth of its industrial exports. It's not a distinction Israelis uniformly relish, and the no-longer secret dealings with Iran have ignited arguments about the rightness of arming avowed enemies in Teheran and dubious customers of convenience like South Africa."

Tutu is urging the Reagan Administration to institute a new policy toward South Africa, offering Pretoria a choice between extensive financial and diplomatic support for dismantling apartheid, or greatly increased ostracism. Such a strategy, Archbishop Tutu said, would entail a decision by Washington to stop vetoing mandatory United Nations sanctions and to sever all telecommunications with South Africa if the country's white rulers refused to accept a timetable for change. His proposal, he indicated, would include possible American backing for white minority rights in a post-apartheid South Africa."

It is highlighted by a battle of two titans of modern Bolivian history, each now in his eighth decade, who fathered the nationalized mining system over which they now confront each other. The Government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, 79 years old, says that in the face of low world prices for tin and production costs that are the highest in the world it has no choice but to close some mines and impose efficiency on others. And for future mining development, it intends to put its faith in private enterprise."

Bhupendra Karia's ''Artronix Index: Photographs at Auction,'' published last month by Artronix Data Corporation, 9 East 96th Street, documents, according to Mr. Karia, each of the 264 photography auctions held in a score of houses throughout the world between 1952 and 1984. He chose 1952, he said, because it was the year Swann Galleries in New York held this country's first postwar auction of photography - from the estate of Albert C. Marshall, a Rhode Island industrialist. Mr. Karia is completing a second volume, which will cover 1985 and 1986; it will be issued in March 1987, he said. Distribution for both works is being handled by the photography dealer Daniel Wolf, 30 West 57th Street. The first volume costs $2,500; the second volume will be $700, Mr. Karia said."

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"The murder trial of two avowed revolutionaries under way here is one that Wilfred P. Diana, the assignment judge for Warren, Hunterdon and Somerset Counties, calls ''difficult.'' That is why he assigned it to Judge Michael R. Imbriani. ''He's unflappable,'' Judge Diana said of the 57-year-old judge who went through Harvard Law School on scholarship. ''He's even-tempered but firm. He has a lot of experience with difficult, high-visibility cases that call for administrative ability as well as judicial acumen.''"

Done in clean desert tones of stucco and unfinished wood, this casual spot sports firm fabric-covered banquettes, little tables scattered about and an exposed kitchen behind a tile service counter. Brendan Walsh, the resourceful young chef, has created an all-day tasting menu that features appetizer-size portions for $6 to $12."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"The commander of the Honduran armed forces said today that if Sandinista troops violated Honduran territory again, as they did earlier this month in a battle with Nicaraguan rebels, Honduras would consider a retaliatory air strike deep into Nicaragua. In the December battle, which the Hondurans asserted took place on its territory, Honduras mounted an air strike with its air force against Sandinista positions inside Honduras. The senior Honduran commander, General Humberto Regalado Hernandez, also offered details of an earlier Honduran announcement that President Jose Azcona Hoyo telephoned President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua and demanded the withdrawal of Sandinista forces from Honduras before ordering the air strike against the Nicaraguans on Dec. 8. General Regalado, speaking in an interview here, did not specify the targets he had in mind for a possible future retaliatory strike. But he said the attacks would not be related to the dipute between the Sandinistas and the Nicaraguan rebels known as contras."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"Pope John Paul II called today for a radical change in the way man exercises his dominion over the earth, saying the world's leaders should listen to the poor and the silent and those who pray for peace. The Pope made the appeal in his annual ''Urbi et Orbi'' Christmas message to the city of Rome and to the world, and afterward he offered his Christmas greetings in 51 languages. The form of John Paul's address today was unusual. It was written in free verse, and it was more of a prayer than a speech. The themes were ones he talks about frequently: the dangers of war and the special importance of the World Day of Prayer for Peace he held in the Italian town of Assisi last Oct. 27."

Despite extensive quoting of sources, the article contains information that distorts the reality of my Government's campaign against cocaine trafficking. The article frequently quotes ''accusations'' made by a police major, Ciro Jijena, to a committee of the Bolivian Congress, to throw doubt -unwillingly, I am sure - on the moral integrity and honesty of some Bolivian authorities, among them, the Minister of the Interior, Fernando Barthelemy."

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"In this region, where three great religions were born, the issues of faith and promise are again stirring societies. They are not simple issues, long settled, because religion is about how men and women behave toward each other as well as about belief in their relations to God. Change has been coming at a rate never known in human history and it imposes ever new demands. The changes are welcome for what they bring in well-being, health, protection from the rigors and cruelties of nature. And they are frightening for what they bring in uncertainty and challenge. So they create new questions in everyday personal and social life and questions about the role of religion."

''I was almost in tears,'' Mrs. Overbaugh said as she sat with her three children on Christmas Eve in a public shelter here. ''I never thought that the same thing would happen to me.'' Mrs. Overbaugh and her children were sitting on an old convertible sofa, a bed for her and her two sons, Carl, who is 10 years old, and Tony, 6, since last Friday. Her daughter, Christel, 8, sleeps on a folding cot at their feet.

Armed with loaded combat-style rifles, the men inched up to a gravel road, darted across, one by one, and disappeared in the tall grass. The men snaking through the bush were Cuban-Americans who say the most important thing in their lives is fighting Communism and the man who brought it to their homeland, Fidel Castro. If they can't get at him, they say, they'll do what they can in Nicaragua, where, they say, he is heavily involved."

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"Fifteen months after the historic meeting at the Plaza Hotel where the United States and its major industrial partners agreed to drive the value of the dollar down, currency traders and economists are wondering where the governments of the industrial nations want to see exchange rates settle. The majority view is that the dollar is likely to decline further against leading foreign currencies, but few foreign exchange experts predict that the drop will exceed 10 percent. 'A Two-Sided Question' ''We've clearly taken some of the disequilibrium out of the system,'' said David Munro, an international economist for the General Motors Corporation. ''From 1982 to 1984, it was clear that the dollar had gone too far, and the job was to bring it back. Now it's a two-sided question.'' The leading contrary view is that the dollar might actually strengthen in the next year if the United States performs well economically and its trade deficit subsides."

He sounded the way Easterners do when they talk about excesses indulged in by residents of that other coast. Considering the vagaries of New York winter weather, it would seem more logical to have a limo hot tub, if indeed there is such a thing, in cars here but, alas, the Big Apple's fast lane apparently still hasn't caught up with all of life's refinements. But just so no one thinks the city is somewhere on the back track when it comes to transportation, it should be known that there is at least one 40-foot beauty in Manhattan - a white Lincoln with a red interior that has three bars, two television sets, two video-cassette recorders and one laser disk. It is so popular that an identical car, except that its interior will be gray, is expected any day."

Samuel Johnson had died the previous December, and Boswell, who had just published his account of the tour that he and Johnson had made to the Hebrides, was getting ready to start work on a full-scale biography. Over the next three years or so he completed a first draft, and at the same time continued keeping the journal that was eventually, after coming to light in the 20th century, to give him a secondary but substantial claim to lasting fame."

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"IF you like Jean Jacques Rachou's Cote Basque - and legions do - chances are you will like Le Festival, the two-month-old reincarnation of his former Cafe Lavandou on East 61st Street. While Le Festival's young staff, all-seafood menu and decor are new, the restaurant essentially reflects the classic and copious approach of the boss. It's a timely idea, this all-fish theme, and in characteristic Rachou style, no effort is spared to obtain the best of everything for his devoted fans -then assemble it on plates the size of hubcaps. The menu flirts with a few Oriental-inspired modern preparations, but it still remains faithful to dishes that are lavish with butter, cream and garnishes. Many of the creations are exceptionally good, but don't expect to leave the dining room with a lilt in your step."

The issue figures in an Iranian offer to intercede on behalf of American hostages in Lebanon. The officials agreed to continue talks on the Iranian claim instead of turning it over to the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal for arbitration. The tribunal - made up of three Americans, three Iranians and three people from other countries - ruled earlier that either nation could go to it for adjudication if no agreement were reached by Dec. 20."

Michael Jordan, who scored 50 points the last time he was here, the home opener of the Knicks in November, showed up in his customary cherry-red traveling uniform, and his customary assortment of riveting moves. He is magical on the basketball court and does everything except saw people in half. Sometimes, it seems he saws himself in half, and then in thirds and fourths, and never gets shorter."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"JOHN STORRS may be one of those artists that each generation has to discover for itself. He will never be a household name. There is nothing flamboyant about his work, and his most public and monumental sculptures - in Chicago and Cork, Ireland - may be his most problematical. But he is one of America's most important early modernist sculptors, and artists continue to be inspired by his attempt to realize an international, utopian ambition in economical, unpretentious form. Storrs was born in Chicago in 1885, the son of an architect and real-estate developer whose family founded Storrs, Conn. From an early age, he traveled extensively. In Paris he either knew or studied with Rodin, Bourdelle and Lipchitz. In 1914 he married Marguerite Chabrol, a French writer from Orleans. Seven years later, he bought a chateau that remained his base in France, where he died in 1956. Throughout his career, he had one foot in France, which he described as a ''peaceful lap of culture and age-old beauty,'' and one foot in the United States, which he identified with hope and the future."

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"Good times are coming to an end for the only part of the American steel industry that has been consistently profitable. For the last five years, while the major steel producers' losses mounted, steel service centers flourished as one of the few oases of profit in the beleaguered industry. As the industry's middlemen, the centers buy steel from both domestic and foreign mills, then cut and shape it to customers' specifications. The rise of steel service centers resulted as manufacturers became more and more skittish about keeping huge inventories of steel products in their warehouses. Playing an increasingly vital role in inventory control, the centers began to profit by allowing manufacturers in the automobile, appliance and machinery industries to have the steel parts they needed when they were needed."

1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"DURING the last two years, six young New York architects met regularly at one another's homes and studios to discuss alternatives to what they called ''the flatness of present architectural discourse'' and ''the dense wall of post-modernism.'' The six - Neil Denari, Wes Jones, Peter Pfau, Ken Kaplan, Ted Krueger and Chris Scholz - said they believed that post-modernism's retreat into classicism had limited architecture's range and technical capabilities, and that a machine-inspired architecture offered possibilities for richer buildings better tuned to contemporary culture. The results of their discussions are on view at a new show at P.S. 1 in Queens, ''Building Machines,'' and the exhibition is a manifesto. The three rooms of the show have architectural models and drawings of small and large buildings, all equipped with operable parts - roofs retract; floors flip up; stairways roll and lift; sun screens rotate. Buildings as humble as huts and as vast as ocean liners are designed to be kinetic rather than static - operable by hand or, like a convertible, at the push of a button. Some have rudimentary 19th-century mechanisms; one is really an electronic environment that senses the airwaves - the environment is not one of breezes and sunlight but of information."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: David C. Anderson's remarks (''Tinkering With Justice,'' Editorial Notebook, Dec. 4) on the U.S. Sentencing Commission are disappointing, not because he paints a less than rosy picture of commission efforts, but because he seems not to understand our motivations. Guided by explicit statute, the commission is not ''tinkering with justice,'' but attempting to develop guidelines to insure fairness and certainty in sentencing. These ideals, extremely difficult to balance when dealing with a multitude of Federal statutes, are at the heart of the commission's preliminary draft of sentencing guidelines, published Oct. 1 in the Federal Register."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"People no longer try to burn down the Adirondack Park Agency headquarters here, nor do they dump manure on the lawn or punch the employees. But while the more overt forms of hostility have disappeared in the 15 years since the Adirondack Park Agency was founded, many of the 120,000 people who live inside the park still nurse a deep resentment against it and say it has acquired too much control over local life. In a recent expression of this resentment, the governments of 11 of the 12 counties that lie wholly or partially inside the park - an unusual combination of public and private land - voted to finance a lawsuit challenging the agency's zoning rules as an infringement of residents' constitutional rights. Impoverished Region The people of the Adirondacks, who pride themselves on retaining the stubbornly individualistic spirit of the frontier, have never held government in high esteem. The nation's power centers seem remote to residents of this area, where most towns are little more than an intersection and Albany is considered the southern part of the state."
1986-12-26T00:00:00Z,"The television networks and Hollywood studios may be headed for a showdown over the often-hefty profits from rerun rights to prime-time shows. The issue is among the most contentious in the entertainment business today. For the most part, the networks are now barred by Federal regulations from owning shows or sharing in the proceeds from the syndication of reruns. But the rule prohibiting the networks from producing more than a small amount of their own programming is set to expire in 1990. And when that rule, the one of most immediate concern to the Hollywood studios, runs out, the networks effectively will gain the right to share in some syndication revenues - largely at the studios' expense."

The Washington Redskins had won the previous Super Bowl and looked no less invincible as defending champions, winning 14 games and a division title. The Los Angeles Rams squeezed into the playoffs as a wild-card team with a 9-7 record, beat the Cowboys and won a trip to Washington. Some prize. ''They were a fantastic team that year,'' Eric Dickerson of the Rams remembered the other day. He was a rookie that season, the National Football League's leading rusher and a man smart enough to know a buzzsaw when he walked into one, especially one he had seen before. The Rams had also played the Redskins during the regular season and lost, 42-20. ''We came into the playoff game a little scared,'' Dickerson said. ''After that first game, we didn't think we could beat them the second time.''"

Alice and Robert Riddell, from Queens, went to the Palm Court at the Plaza Hotel for brunch, as they have for some 20 years. And thousands of miles away at the Vatican, as popes have for hundreds of years, Pope John Paul II said midnight mass. But for the first time, this mass was broadcast on state television in his native Poland. A Friend Is Remembered All over the world, traditions were embraced, in churches, at homes and at familiar landmarks, among loved ones as well as among strangers connected through the shared celebration. It was a time for families to stay close and count their blessings as well as for remembering those who were alone and dispossessed. In Paris, Aurel Cornea was thankful to be home for Christmas after 292 days as a hostage in Lebanon. [ Page A12. ] In the cavernous waiting room of Grand Central Terminal, a group of homeless men and women remembered the friend they knew only as Mama. The woman, still unidentified, was found dead last Christmas on the long wooden bench in the waiting room that had become her only resting place. She died of pneumonia and pulmonary emphysema."

The revelation in mock-hushed tones from a member in the House of Commons concerned journalism, not espionage. The nonmeetings in the turret occur promptly every working day at 4 P.M., when the reporters who cover the Government and House of Commons hear from Bernard Ingham, the Prime Minister's press secretary, and his aides. They answer questions on various current issues with the stipulation that none of what they claim, contend, assert and say can be attributed to the Downing Street office of the Prime Minister in news reports."

Mr. Wasson, who was a retired vice president of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, was awarded the Addison Emery Verrill Medal of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University in 1983. The citation said that, together with his wife and co-author, Dr. Valentina P.

The Aki Oriental Food Company has imported such holiday delicacies as sweetened sardines. The Dorcas Japanese bakery has special cakes on hand. And next Saturday there will be celebrations at the Japanese school in nearby Ridgefield. In Japan the New Year is welcomed with homes decorated in bamboo, feasts of sea bream and rice cakes, visits to relatives in the villages and to Shinto or Buddhist shrines, and parades of kimono-clad marchers.

The two men, Timothy M. Carmody of San Francisco and Steven W. Hedrick of Ocala, Fla., were among eight Americans arrested 10 months ago off Brazil, with a ship bearing six tons of weapons. They say they were headed for the West African country to join in a coup attempt aimed at the military Government of Lieut. Jerry Rawlings. Mr. Carmody and Mr. Hedrick said in interviews today that they believed they were participating in a plan sanctioned by the United States Government and led by Godfrey Osei, a Ghanaian dissident and expatriate living in the New York City borough of Queens. Mr. Osei led a failed coup attempt in 1983. Mr. Carmody, a Vietnam veteran and a co-founder of the Rhodesia Veterans Association, a group of Americans who worked as private soldiers in Rhodesia in the late 1970's, said that once in Ghana, they were to meet with supporters of Mr. Osei who would attack the capital city of Accra while the Americans attempted to free Ghanaian nationals jailed on charges that they were working covertly for the Central Intelligence Agency."

1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"In ''Barbra Streisand: One Voice,'' on the Home Box Office cable channel tonight at 10, we have the entertainer as singer doing battle with the entertainer as concerned advocate. Fortunately, the singer wins, though just barely. I must confess to a chronic allergy to show business personalities who become soapbox orators. Whether it's Charlton Heston on the right or Jane Fonda on the left, just for starters, the sincerity-laden performances inevitably tend to leave me cringing in embarrassment before such profound superficiality. For the most part, I am entirely in Ms. Streisand's corner so far as her causes are concerned, but I keep wishing she would just sing. That's what she does best. This pay-cable special was taped Sept. 6 in the exquisite garden of Miss Streisand's imposing California home. Warming up the audience, Robin Williams says, ''Welcome to the Malibu Shakespeare Festival.'' An exclusive audience of 500 Hollywood celebrities paid $5,000 a couple, with the proceeds going to politicians, including the then-campaigning Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, and to the Barbra Streisand Foundation. A note at the end of the program explains that the foundation ''supports qualified charitable organizations committed to antinuclear activities, the preservation of our environment, our civil liberties and human rights.''"

Even as Beijing was joining other cities in clamping down on student protesters, 10,000 students in Nanjing, the industrialized capital of Jiangsu Province, were reported to have marched through the city calling for greater democracy, part of a continuing student campaign that is sweeping China. The action by the Beijing city government follows a similar action on Monday by the Shanghai authorities, who in effect banned demonstrations. In five days of protests in Shanghai that were brought to a halt earlier this week, more than 50,000 students marched through the streets with banners calling for democracy and freedom."

Even New York pauses on such occasions for a moment's contemplation that intrudes into the ceaseless work schedule. Down at the South Street Seaport, on the East River at Fulton Street, more than a century and a half of holiday seasons have drifted by the clippers and schooners tethered to the piers, and such occasions may have become more festive in recent years. For one thing, the seaport is a museum and a shopping center, though it retains the workaday fish houses, with their smell of the sea. Every evening for a month now, aboard a 25-foot-high platform, there has been special acknowledgement of the holidays. As darkness brings forth a burst of brightness from the skyscrapers that form a backdrop to the seaport, 65 singers, dressed in green and red capes, arrange themselves on the platform, producing an effect of being part of a large Christmas tree."

What is not apparent from the film or the review is that the remaining Indians in South America today face loss of their lands, epidemics and a threat to their very existence. Tragically, the horrors depicted in ''The Mission'' are not only history, but are the daily reality of a number of Indian groups who have survived."

Drexel commands nearly half of the market for high-yield bonds. ''They're saying, 'If anything comes up that makes you want to reconsider your relationship with Drexel, let us know,' '' said Harold Simmons, the Dallas investor. $6.6 Billion Since Nov. 14 So far, though, Drexel's grasp appears firm. Since Mr. Boesky admitted guilt to insider trading charges and agreed to pay $100 million in penalties on Nov. 14, Drexel has brought more than $6.6 billion of new issues to market. This total is said by specialists in the bond market to be substantially higher than Drexel's usual 50 percent of new issues. Of the $6.6 billion, almost all has been raised through Drexel's famed high-yield junk bond department orchestrated in Beverly Hills, Calif., by Michael Milken."

Bosworth, an all-America and two-time winner of the Butkus Award as the nation's outstanding linebacker, has one year of college eligibility remaining but could also enter next spring's National Football League draft because he was red-shirted as a freshman.

1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"The events of the past few months, especially the Dec. 6 parliamentary election, show that Taiwan is moving steadily toward a more representative government and a two-party political system. This is happening just as Beijing is making clear, in its talks with Hong Kong representatives, that it is unlikely to allow either development after it takes over the British colony in 1997. The contrast is all the more ironic since the advertised leniency of Beijing's control measures for the ''Hong Kong Special Administrative Zone'' post-1997 were intended as a model and an inducement for Taiwan's reunification with China."

Eleven months ago, he successfully defended Jonah Perry, a 19-year-old Cornell University sophomore who had been charged with assaulting and trying to rob a police officer who had fatally shot his younger brother, Edmund, during the scuffle. The case received widespread attention because the Perry brothers had risen above their impoverished Harlem surroundings to attend exclusive boarding schools on scholarships."

A bitter fight against the aquarium has begun within the leafy courtyards and graceful architecture of the quarter, the old city settled by the French in the 18th century. The historic district is now a prime tourist attraction. For those who live there, the fight is another battle in the war against creeping commercialism, which they say is hurting the residential and historic character of the Vieux Carre.

1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"The quarterback is not only the most glamorous player in football, he is a symbolic figure, too. He represents stability in a sport with a high turnover rate. He is a leader, by design, if not nature, the coach's emissary on the playing field. Running backs may tumble and defenses crumble, but a quarterback is expected to withstand a blitz of adversity. When the Giants' golden era of the 1950's and early 60's ended in 1964, no words could have captured their demise any better than the photograph of Y. A.

A new batch of signs, put up in stations, cars and buses, extol the virtues of the authority's reconstruction efforts. ''New and Overhauled Cars - Subway cars like they ought to be'' is the headline on one. ''Fast Track - the trains are getting up to speed again'' reads another. ''The concept started over the summer,'' said a spokesman, Donna Evans. ''We felt it was one of the best ways we can get information to passengers on why service was delayed.

But their efforts to score again with My Child's Destiny, selling elegant -and elegantly priced - children's products, did not fare nearly as well. In October, four years after they invested their personal profits from Victoria's in the new business, they filed for Chapter 11 protection, ending their catalogue sales and closing the doors of their children's department store here. Baby Bjorn Potty Chair The concept was a simple one: well-heeled parents could shop for everything from an Apple computer to a Baby Bjorn imported Swedish potty chair to a Galway Irish crystal baby bottle labeled ''for decorative use only - not to be used to feed baby,'' all under one roof, or by catalogue. The Raymonds figured that imported clothing, home computers and quality toys would hold great attraction for the growing number of professional couples having their first, and possibly only, child."

The draft report recommends that at least $1 billion a year be put into a new trust fund to acquire, preserve and protect some of the nation's remaining open space. It also calls for the creation of protected ''greenways,'' open, natural corridors between urban centers, some of them along rivers.

1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"A major diplomatic dispute has erupted over the itinerary here of the Archbishop of New York during a Middle East trip in which he plans to visit Israel beginning Jan. 1. The argument grows out of what Israeli officials say are changes that the Vatican and the Archbishop, John Cardinal O'Connor, want to make in whom he will meet and where he will meet them during an official four-day visit to Jerusalem. The thrust of these changes, Israeli officials said today, appeared to be an effort to eliminate any hint that Cardinal O'Connor was having official political contacts with the Israeli Government or recognizing its control over Jerusalem. However, the Cardinal's office in New York said today that the unanticipated appointment of a new Auxiliary Bishop for New York had made it necessary for the Cardinal to be in Rome by the evening of Jan. 5, requiring him to shorten his stay in Israel and cancel a stop in Egypt. Comments on Palestinians The origins of the Cardinal's trip lie in comments he made last June, in which he spoke of how, from ''a moral perspective,'' it was clear that ''a homeland has to be provided for the Palestinian peoples.'' His remarks were criticized by some American Jewish groups, who urged Shimon Peres, then Prime Minister, to meet with Cardinal O'Connor."
1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"Amid a flurry of conflicting claims of responsibility by anonymous callers, Iran yesterday dismissed accusations by Iraq and Jordan that it was behind the hijacking of an Iraqi airliner in which Saudi Arabia has said 62 people were killed. The Iranian statement, reported in a state radio broadcast that was monitored in Cyprus, was issued as callers claiming to speak for four different groups said they were responsible. The Iraqi Airways Boeing 737 crashed in a remote desert region in northern Saudi Arabia Thursday after being commandeered by armed men who, according to witnesses, subsequently battled with security men as the crew struggled to control the plane. Government sources in Amman said the gunmen confessed to Saudi interrogators that they had planned to take the plane to Damascus and on to Teheran. But the Saudi Government, which provided the first official announcement of the crash, remained silent about the hijacking, and questions remained about many aspects of the disaster, including the number of people on board the flight, the number who died or were injured, the number of hijackers involved, and to what group, if any, they were linked."

Mr. Hall said that at Nikora International, a store at 727 Seventh Avenue, Jimmy Sultan, a salesman, showed him a book that said Hereke rugs, woven in Turkey in the 19th century, usually cost at least $1,700 per sqare foot. The carpet Mr. Hall was considering was 3 feet by 5 feet, a $25,500 value by that estimate; Mr. Sultan told him it was worth $48,000.

It's an unwieldy, uneven work - by turns, hilarious and stultifying, daring and derivative - but at the same time, it's a novel that attests to the publishers's committment to risky new fiction and its young author's rich reserves of ambition and imagination."
1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"Two Mexicans have been arrested in Los Angeles in connection with the murder of a United States drug agent who was kidnapped and tortured last year while working in Mexico, Federal officials said today. The Drug Enforcement Administration said the two men were being charged with violations of Federal narcotics laws and were also being accused of taking part in a conspiracy to kidnap and murder the drug agent, Enrique Camarena Salazar. Mr. Camarena Salazar was abducted in Guadalajara on Feb. 7, 1985. His beaten body, wrapped in a plastic bag, was found a month later."

1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"The lawyer for a victim of the racially motivated beatings in Howard Beach, Queens, last Saturday charged yesterday that the driver of the car that killed one of the victims was a willful participant in the attack from the beginning. The attorney, Alton H. Maddox Jr., said both the police and the Queens District Attorney had known that his client, Cedric Sandiford, made the allegation the night of the attack and they had failed to act on it. ''I think this raises serious questions about the integrity of the investigation,'' Mr. Maddox said at a news conference. Reaction by Santucci But the police, providing for the first time a detailed account of the motorist's actions, sharply contradicted the charges. They also disclosed that a woman had been with the driver, Dominick Blum, at the time of the crash. [ Page 26. ] The prosecutor, John J. Santucci, said at another news conference that it was the first time he had heard Mr. Sandiford's allegation. He said it would be ''virtually impossible'' for anyone to identify the driver of the car that night on the Shore Parkway or for an attacker involved in chasing the three black men to time his entrance to the highway so as to deliberately hit someone."
1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"There is a foreboding implication in the current year-end deluge of fund-raising appeals: give now - before it is too late. The implication is that the tradition of charitable giving in America is linked inextricably to the tax benefits it yields and that therefore the charitable impulse will disappear at midnight on Jan. 1, when tax reform takes effect. This notion is both false and disturbing. It stems from the unspoken assumption that all behavior is dictated solely by economic gain. It distorts, to the detriment of donor and recipient, the fundamental nature and purpose of gift-giving."

1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"It was the latest in a 500-year-old tradition of clever theories explaining the sly smile, the veiled hair, the crossed hands, the regal pose: the Mona Lisa was not a woman at all, but a man. She was, in fact, Leonardo da Vinci himself in the guise of a woman. The theory was put forward in a magazine, Art and Antiques, last week, and within hours it became elevator chat and cocktail party conversation. At the Louvre in Paris -as happens with every flare of publicity about what is arguably the world's most famous painting - the crowds swelled around the work."
1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"Facilities for producing America's nuclear warheads are decrepit, safety procedures lax and management complacent. The Reagan Administration did not create these problems but it has made them worse. It doubled production of nuclear warheads since 1980, mostly for new weapons ordered by the Carter Administration, but spent little to modernize the aging plant. Now, maybe just in time to avert a serious accident, the Department of Energy has placed some plants under new management and ordered others shut down. It's a step toward protecting health, and national security, but too small and too aimless."

1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"David M. Abshire, the 60-year-old foreign-policy professional named by President Reagan to help steer the White House through the Iran-contra arms crisis, is an affable and undramatic Republican who has proved adept at working with both parties. As Washington's delegate to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization since 1983, he has urged bipartisan consensus in foreign policy, has maintained close contacts with both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill and has written of the need for Presidential consultation with Congress. Western diplomats have given Mr. Abshire high marks during his tenure at NATO, praising his energy and enthusiasm in fostering consultations among allies, improving efficiency and lobbying members of Congress by telephone from Brussels when sentiment arose in 1984 to withdraw United States troops from Western Europe. He has been one of the Administration's most articulate advocates of a new generation of American chemical weapons, arguing that they, and not nuclear arms, are the appropriate deterrent to Soviet use of chemical weapons in Europe."

1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"Hungary and Rumania are engaged in an increasingly public struggle over one of this region's historically divisive issues: minority rights. Experts on regional affairs say that not since the creation of the Soviet bloc at the end of World War II has there been such open and sustained tension between two members. They say that, although the disagreement does not put into question loyalty to Moscow, the surfacing of the long-submerged rivalry indicates a new will to assert conflicting national interests and demonstrate the less than monolithic nature of the Soviet camp. At issue are the ethnically Hungarian people who have been living under Rumanian rule since Transylvania, once part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, was assigned to Rumania after World War I. They are said to number between 1.7 million and 2 million."
1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"Although she is at least in her 80's and uses a wheelchair, Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek casts a long and perplexing shadow over Taiwan's politics. Mrs. Chiang moved to the United States shortly after her husband died in 1975 and lived there for 11 years. She returned to Taiwan in October to celebrate the 100th anniversary of his birth, and this capital city is full of theories about what she is up to. Although she was born Mei-ling Soong, she is best known, in Chinese as well as English, as Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek. Her husband ruled China until 1949, when Communist forces triumphed on the mainland, and then he governed the island of Taiwan."
1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"As the New York metropolitan region's problems with transportation, energy, water, affordable housing and garbage continue to grow, appearing to become more intractable each day, business and academic leaders are renewing calls for some form of regional government. The calls, which are perhaps being heard the loudest on Long Island, are from some of the most influential people in the region, many of whom are saying that local governments, from municipalities to counties, cannot handle their troubles by working alone. ''We must find a way to govern ourselves as a total, interrelated and interdependent community rather than as a series of independent and competing townships, each with its own bureaucracy,'' said John C. Bierwirth, chairman of the Grumman Corporation, Long Island's largest employer. Reluctant to Change Mr. Bierwirth, who recently delivered a blunt speech about Long Island's future, described municipal handling of solid waste management as ''pathetic'' and the fight over the Shoreham nuclear power plant as a ''depressing spectacle of political and business paralysis.'' Even with comments like Mr. Bierwirth's, which were echoed by business leaders across the region, most government officials appeared reluctant to endorse significant change in how municipalities and counties operate. They say they fear the imposition of yet another governmental layer or just as significant, the loss of home rule."

Pat Cash gave Australia its victory by outlasting Stefan Edberg, Sweden's No. 1 player, 13-11, 13-11, 6-4.

Ferdinand was timed in 1:21 3/5, well off the track record of 1:20 set by Spectacular Bid in this event in 1980. Ridden by Bill Shoemaker, Ferdinand was last at the start of the seven-furlong race, but worked his way through the field of 12 until the stretch. There, he caught Snow Chief in the final quarter and pulled away for the triumph. Snow Chief, also making his first start in six months, held on for second. A long shot, Don B. Blue, was third.(UPI) M.I.S.L."

1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"One result of the 1986 tax law that few people in or out of Congress anticipated is that life insurance companies have a greater incentive to acquire brokerage firms. Although some insurers have already built a stake on Wall Street, executives in the field and securities analysts see a new push developing. The key reason is that with individual income tax rates lower and capital gains rates higher under the new law, many of the insurance products sold by brokers have become more attractive to investors. These products include single-premium life insurance and other policies that benefit from cash value buildup free from current tax. ''The law may encourage some of the larger companies to look at stock brokerage firms because they'll be looking at expanded distribution efforts,'' said Fred Townsend, an analyst at Conning & Company, based in Hartford, which specializes in insurance stocks. ''Stockbrokers are sort of a natural avenue.''"

That is not the fact. Joseph A. Shelly, former chief probation officer of the probation department of Kings County Supreme Court conceived the idea of starting a drug-free facility for treating drug users in the late 1950's. He enlisted the support of the professional staff of his department in that undertaking. Dr. Alexander Bassin, then a case supervisor and director of education and research of Kings County's probation department (he is now professor of psychology in the School of Criminology, Florida State University, Tallahassee) wrote the proposal, and the grant was made by the National Institutes of Mental Health."

Mr. Abshire is expected to have direct access to Mr. Reagan and is to serve as an adviser to the President. To Draw From Other Offices The working group Mr. Abshire will direct is to comprise officials detached from other White House offices, such as press, legal and Congressional relations, officials said. But there was no word on how large a staff Mr. Abshire would have. There was also no announcement on where the office would be situated."
1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"The game's pivotal play tonight was a personal matter, and a novelty, shared by a rookie goaltender from Washington and a seasoned Islander forward. Bob Mason, who has become something of a savior for the struggling Capitals, had never faced a penalty shot in his life and was attempting to preserve a 2-1 lead that suddenly was very much in jeopardy. Brent Sutter, the center who foraged on Mason's doorstep much of the evening, had never in his National Hockey League career been put in the role of the soloist who skates from center ice headlong toward a waiting goalie. Tonight, Sutter was awarded his shot after being tripped by Mike Gartner on a breakaway attempt 6 minutes 22 seconds into the third period. He checked his stick as he sprinted toward the crouching Mason, and he also recalled some advice from Mike Bossy, who told him to blast the puck point-blank at a goalie whenever he got the chance for a private confrontation."

However, every bank Mr. Capelli contacted insisted on different forms of documentation and verification before he would be allowed to become a depositor. After settling on Citibank, he had to return to the nearby branch three different times before his records from his previous bank were accepted - the Citibank officer wanted the most recent statement from his previous bank, not an earlier one - and the account was opened.

1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"In the 25 days since he woke up one morning to find himself a head coach for the first time, Bob Hill has lost 15 pounds. He said he sometimes forgets to eat. He hasn't slept much, either, which becomes evident as he yawns uncontrollably just a few minutes into a conversation. So there was the thought that Hill might have been the one to leap into the arms of Patrick Ewing following the Knick center's game-winning shot Thursday against the Chicago Bulls."
1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"Iraq regained control today of four islands in a waterway dividing Iran and Iraq after a 24-hour Iranian offensive, United States Government officials said. Both Iraq and Iran said they had inflicted heavy casualties on the other during Iran's brief attack on Iraqi positions on four islands in the Shatt al Arab, a waterway near the major Iraqi city of Basra. Administration analysts said they could not judge the magnitude of the losses, but said the Iranian operation was clearly a limited one, and not the ''final offensive'' long promised by Iranian leaders to win the six-year-old war. Since last summer, 700,000 Iranian soldiers have been stationed along the southern front near Basra, presumably in preparation for the ''final offensive.'' Iranian leaders have apparently been wary of committing their forces against 500,000 Iraqis, equipped with superior armor and air power, American officials said today."

If that neighbor cares for at least five children or if any of them are under age 2, she is, strictly speaking, running a family day-care center. Chances are, though, that the Health Department won't know it. Almost all such centers are unlicensed. That means they can operate without smoke detectors, fire exits and fire extinguishers, window guards, first-aid kits and adequate space. Never having asked for clearance from any city agencies, they need never fear inspection."

1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: One of the longer-range aspects of heavy-duty truck safety (front page, Dec. 7) is the need to keep the country's truck fleets in reasonably new condition. Consideration must be given to economic conditions that favor early replacement of older vehicles, thereby insuring that vital safety components are not worn out and that vehicles are equipped with the latest safety improvements. America must avoid the condition that has afflicted the Indian trucking industry at the cost of thousands of lives. In India, trucks are kept in operation so long that, in wear and age, they are beyond the point of being junk heaps and may be classified as museum pieces. This results from a chronic shortage of hire-purchase credit (caused by chronic government deficits), coupled with a value-added tax that makes new trucks in India extremely expensive."

1986-12-27T00:00:00Z,"Strictures about drinking and driving are not new. Indeed, in recent years they have multiplied. More states have adopted laws to punish drunken drivers. In a way, however, the laws are misdirected. They penalize drivers after they have been drinking; they do not necessarily prevent drivers from drinking.

The event was precipitated by a remarkable coincidence: the intervention with Soviet authorities of the American industrialist, Armand Hammer, whom I had never met; and at the same time, the fortuitous, if unfortunate onset of an international political crisis in which I unwittingly played a part. Two years earlier, I had refused to cooperate with the K.G.B., the Soviet secret police, when they first tried to entrap my friend and occasional dinner companion, the American journalist Nicholas S. Daniloff. It was only last summer, when Nick was at last arrested on the false charge of espionage, that the previous episode was made public."

He wore circular steel-rimmed spectacles and had an inverted-V mustache that reached just to the corners of his mouth.

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"There were no last-second heroics needed, and the opposition was not a team with dubious credentials. Rather, this was a rout of a legitimate contender, and it was truly the Knicks' finest moment in a long while. In a victory that may have signified the end of their arduous transition from one coaching philosophy to another, the Knicks pummeled the Milwaukee Bucks last night at Madison Square Garden, 114-100, to extend their winning streak to three games, their longest in more than a year. In winning for just the eighth time in 30 games this season, the Knicks dominated a team that had a 15-game winning streak against them, and one considered by many observers to be the league's hottest. The Bucks had won five straight games and 9 of their last 11. But they Knicks broke from a 50-50 tie at intermission and led by as many 20 points in what became their most convincing victory of the season."

Three black men from Brooklyn, afoot late at night after their car broke down in predominantly white Howard Beach, Queens, were set upon by a gang of white youths who shouted racial epithets and beat them with baseball bats and fists. One of them, Timothy Grimes, escaped with slight injury. Two others, Cedric Sandiford and Michael Griffith, were chased for blocks and repeatedly beaten."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The person, perhaps Will Rogers, who observed that at any given moment half the American population is on the way to a meeting while the other half is returning from one, was obviously not very familiar with Washington. The situation here seems much worse. Meeting-mania has not only blossomed to magnificent excess in the capital - 900 major conventions, seminars, conferences and other gatherings are held here each year by current estimate - but it has also become a rarefied sociopolitical art form that is sometimes so frenetic that it rivals a commodities trading pit. What with problems of protocol, security and overscheduled, egocentric politicians, it is sometimes a wonder that any Washington meeting runs smoothly even when planned by the capital's growing cadre of full-time professionals."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"St. John's, through its first seven games, had followed an interesting pattern of falling behind early, pulling even at the midway point, then being saved, more or less at the end, by a three-man rescue squad: Mark Jackson, Willie Glass and Shelton Jones. Yesterday, against a Virginia team that had it boxed in and nearly stripped of all weapons, St. John's was saved by reinforcements. This time it wasn't just by Jackson, Glass and Jones but by another, unlikely crew led by Matt Brust. The 6-foot-5-inch sophomore, who transfered to St. John's from North Carolina last year, scored a career-high 12 points, made three steals and grabbed four rebounds to help St. John's to a 64-58 victory over Virginia in the opening round of the Eastern College Athletic Conference Holiday Festival at Madison Square Garden."

First of all, quoting Hannah Komanoff as a Democrat does an injustice to John Matthews, who has been an active and vocal proponent for issues the article credits to Mr. Gulotta. Since Mr. Matthews may oppose Mr. Gulotta for election for the county executive, his opposing opinion should have been printed in the same article.

In a word, carnival. Music and parades are a constant, but every culture puts its own stamp on carnival, which may embrace just the few days before Ash Wednesday (March 4 next year) all the way to Cologne's 17-week marathon: Mardi Gras and Jouvert, Sambadrome and Vivaldi, the Women's Carnival and even survivals of pre-Christian Roman feasts.

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"THE COMPLETE NOTEBOOKS OF HENRY JAMES Edited by Leon Edel and Lyall H. Powers. Illustrated. 633 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $30. NEAR the end of his life Henry James destroyed many of his personal papers. Probably without intending to, he left behind nine notebooks or journals now deposited at Harvard's Houghton Library. Except for one small notebook, they resemble the old composition books, about 6 by 8 inches, which would have cost him only a few pennies each. They were not meant for posterity. They were a place where, in entries dated by James between 1878 and 1911, he could jot down the ''germs'' - things picked up at dinner parties or in his reading - that eventually would become novels or tales. Some notes are skeletal, others develop into full scenarios, and all are far more concerned with his possible method or treatment than with an ostensible subject. The notebooks became a workshop both for his fiction and for his subsequent commentaries on it in the prefaces to the New York Edition of his works, later collected in ''The Art of Fiction'' by R. P. Blackmur, who called them ''the most eloquent and original piece of literary criticism in existence.''"
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Music is featured in new releases from New Zealand which is celebrating the 40th anniversary of its national orchestra. A 30-cent value salutes the influence of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra which performs about 100 concerts annually and is an important part of the country's musical life. Brass bands are featured on a 60-cent stamp. They were introduced into New Zealand in 1845 with the arrival of a British regimental band. In the ensuing years, local volunteer forces formed brass bands that gradually were reorganized into town bands around the turn of the century. Pipe bands, which appear on an 80-cent value, date back to 1773, when Captain Cook arrived in New Zealand and had a Scottish sailor play the bagpipes to attract the attention of Maoris on shore. Country music is a more recent tradition with roots that trace to United States television programs and movies as well as the folk music of New Zealand. The country music stamp is the $1 value in the new set."

''I even got to meet the Governor of New Jersey here. Kean visited our ship in Thailand last September and threw a fancy-cake party for us guys from New Jersey. There are 34 Jersey boys here on the Big J. We hang out together on ship and even on shore. We're like one big happy family. No kidding.''"
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"What the coelacanth is to zoologists, the par contest is to bridge-players. The coelacanth is a primitive creature that was believed to be long extinct and suddenly surfaces, alive and well. Unlike virtually every other form of competitive bridge, a par contest consists of prepared deals in which the players must solve a specific problem in play or defense to earn points. Secondary points are awarded for accurate bidding. One partnership has little to do, and must wait for a later deal for a chance to score."

The doubles triumph gave the Australians a 2-1 lead in the three-of-five-match final. Cash, 21 years old, who defeated Edberg in the opening singles match Friday, has a chance to clinch the championship when he meets Mikael Pernfors in the first singles match Sunday. Paul McNamee is scheduled to play Edberg in the closing singles, a match that will be meaningless if Cash defeats Pernfors, the University of Georgia's two-time national collegiate champion."

They deal with everyday events in the life of a small boy - a day when it's too hot and nothing is happening, a bet with a friend, the trouble that teasing a younger brother can get you into, a frustrating attempt to launch a bottle with a note inside in the river. But they are not told in an everyday way. These stories meander around and take unexpected turns, they double back on themselves and end up in surprising places, almost like shaggy dog stories. They are frequently funny and full of the warmth of a close family."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''Betting That a Stock Will Drop'' (Investing, Dec. 7) does not make clear that short-selling is most and best used by big players. Their commissions are lower, they have the financial and psychological resources to sit out an updraft in a shorted stock, and the big players are given a portion of the interest on the proceeds generated by the short sale. Finally, it is misleading to state that shorts ''will be on an equal tax footing with the longs,'' since shorts must eventually take their profit (if any), whereas longs can let any profits run indefinitely. CHARLES STEIR New York, Dec. 7"
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"''MY boss ruled like a dictator,'' recalled Iris Marchaj of her days at an executive placement firm in Massachusetts. ''He liked to threaten people, to keep them on edge. He transferred me from one city to another arbitrarily. When I wanted to know why, he said it was none of my business. ''One day he found the coffee machine had been left on overnight, and he hit the roof.'' said Ms. Marchaj. ''When his secretary came in, he started yelling, blaming her for things she hadn't done. I stood up for her. For weeks after that, he wouldn't speak to me. When I finally went to talk to him, he said, 'You've made my staff lose respect for me.' I told him I couldn't exist in that closed, lying environment, even though top management had assured me I would be promoted to his level in six months. I quit.'' The tale told by Ms. Marchaj, now a stress-management consultant at Northampton Wellness Associates in Northampton, Mass., is an old one: the unbearable boss who makes life miserable for subordinates."

Just who are these clubs? Indeed, who are the quarterbacks? Pat Ryan for the Jets, Todd Blackledge of the Kansas City Chiefs? Neither has ever started a playoff game. But Ryan is starting because Coach Joe Walton finally decided, after five straight season-ending losses with Ken O'Brien at the helm, to bench O'Brien. And Blackledge, benched in midseason, is expected to start because Bill Kenney has an injured thumb and index finger. And even if Kenney is able to play, it would mark his first playoff start, too."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"THIS was the year that some restaurant cliches of the past gave way to a few new ones, notably Cajun-inspired dishes and mesquite-grilled meats and seafood. Chocolate-mania also was rampant. But 1986 was a first for this column: Only one new three-star restaurant was uncovered. Le Coq Hardi, Westin Hotel, 2701 Summer Street, Stamford (357-0098), is the namesake of its Ridgefield parent and like it offers a nouvelle cuisine menu, under the supervision of the chef, Carl Wright. Celebratory dishes included a nest of spaghetti squash and snails with Pernod butter; seafood sausage with a mustard and chervil sauce; celery-root salad with smoked mussels, snails and cepes sauteed in Burgundy in a brioche; sliced duck breast in hazlenut sauce and desserts such as white mousse cake layered with fresh strawberries and a devilishly rich dark-chocolate torte. Prices are far from cheap and service early on was flawed, but should have smoothed out by now. Because the menu changes frequently, these dishes may be gone by now, but replacements should be equally imaginative."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The owner of the largest share of the idle Seabrook nuclear power station has long asserted that the plant is necessary to fill a growing demand for power in New Hampshire. But the owner, the Public Service Company, disclosed last week that it was going to pay two small power companies $1.25 million to withdraw their plans to build six wood-burning energy generators. The disclosure last Wednesday before the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, which took some people by surprise, highlights the already vigorous debate in the state over how to provide for future energy needs. After 10 years of cost overruns and construction problems, the Seabrook plant needs only a Federal operating permit to begin generating power. Its opponents have assailed the planned payments, asserting that the company is trying to stifle competition from alternative energy sources."

The Attorney General has not indicated whether any charges will be filed against truckers responsible for hauling the waste to Vermont. Environmental officials would not disclose the details of the report except to say they were requesting that ''enforcement action'' be taken in the case."

In a word, carnival. Music and parades are a constant, but every culture puts its own stamp on carnival, which may embrace just the few days before Ash Wednesday (March 4 next year) all the way to Cologne's 17-week marathon: Mardi Gras and Jouvert, Sambadrome and Vivaldi, the Women's Carnival and even survivals of pre-Christian Roman feasts.

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Transcripts of a series of conversations, secretly recorded a year ago by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of an investigation of two construction unions, have provided a rare glimpse of the relationship between city judges and union officials. The transcripts, which were made public late last week, show that a large but undetermined number of Philadelphia judges had longstanding, close and profitable relationships with the leaders of the union locals, which have been linked by prosecutors to organized crime. The investigation has so far led to the indictment of two judges and 19 other people, and comes on the heels of several studies that found the city's court system rife with cronyism, nepotism and patronage based on campaign contributions. Impression of Justice for Sale Taken together, Federal prosecutors and police officials say, the courts' problems have created an impression that they deliver anything but justice and that justice in Philadelphia is for sale, cheap. That view has become so widespread that Judge James R. Cavanaugh of Superior Court has become something of a folk hero here for refusing cash gifts offered by the unions, Local 30 of the United Slate, Tile and Composition Roofers, Damp and Waterproof Workers Association and Local 30B of the Residential Reroofers Union."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"RETURNING last week from their latest fiscal pilgrimage to Albany, executives of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority still had their hats in their hands. While legislators seemed to accept the authority's argument that it needed virtually every dollar of the $8.6 billion it proposed to spend over five years to restore the nation's largest transit system to a state of good repair, there was apparently no rush to provide a means to finance the $1 billion or so the authority still needs to complete the ambitious task. Perhaps the M.T.A. had done too good a job convincing the lawmakers that the $8.3 billion committed during the last five years for improvements to subways, bus lines and commuter railroads was well spent. Perhaps a system that is no longer so intolerable has become politically tolerable."

Still, neither this nor the Spartan-ness of its premises at 1087 East Tremont Avenue in the Bronx deters the organization from conceiving of ambitious schemes. Or so it appears in its current group show, ''Origins,'' on view through Jan. 7. This is the first of a three-part series whose title, ''Dale Que Dale,'' is an idiomatic Spanish expression that translates none too clearly into ''Hit on it and then hit on it again.'' The lights go on, however, when the dictionary's definition of ''dale'' as an interjection expressing displeasure at the obstinacy of another is taken in conjunction with the series' subtitle, ''Ethnocentric Histories of Art.''"
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"THE Minnetonka Corporation doesn't look like much. Its headquarters are in an anonymous one-story cinder-block building across from some cornfields. But in the consumer products industry, the company has been the mouse that roared, churning out revolutionary new products that have thrown industry giants on the defensive. Minnetonka, based 15 miles west of Minneapolis in Chaska (Population 8,643), first upset the industry in 1979, when it introduced Softsoap, the first mass market liquid soap - and in the process, created a whole new product concept that put the lackluster industry into a lather. Then came Minnetonka's Check-Up toothpaste, the first anti-plaque paste and the first in a pump dispenser. Now with its risque, pace-setting advertisements and its huge marketing blitz, the company's Obsession scent is going up for the No. 2 spot among the nation's fragrances, behind Giorgio. The company reached $100 million in sales last year, and Robert R. Taylor, the tall, suave, blue-eyed chairman and founder, said it should surpass $200 million in sales next year. Mr. Taylor, who started Minnetonka in 1964 with a $3,000 investment, said he hopes to reach $500 million within five years. The company's success, he said, lies in a willingness - almost a passion - to go out on a limb with an unusual, often untested idea."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"TO local activists, it seemed like an intractable problem: Midnight dumpers kept throwing refrigerators and mattresses into the empty lots dotting the northern Bronx neighborhood of Williamsbridge. Now two-family houses are under construction on the lots, and the development activity is scaring off the dumpers. ''We were working on a proposal to deal with all the dumping,'' said Pinkie P. Freeman, treasurer of the Williamsbridge Federation, an alliance of block associations. ''Then, a couple of months ago, we realized there really wasn't much of a problem any more.'' It is a milestone in Williamsbridge to have a problem fade away without a fight. Though never ravaged like the South Bronx, the neighborhood endured blockbusting and a bad bout of malaise.

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Whether the driver of a car that killed a black man fleeing a white gang was part of the gang could be crucial to efforts to convict the gang's members of murder, legal experts say. They say that if the driver was part of the group that had beaten 23-year-old Michael Griffith in Howard Beach, Queens, on Dec. 20, there would be a firmer legal connection between the assault and his highway death than if the motorist had simply been a passing stranger. The issue gained significance Friday when a lawyer for a second victim of the assault disputed the authorities' version of Mr. Griffith's death. The lawyer, Alton H. Maddox Jr., said the driver had been a willful participant in the attack and that information had been withheld by the authorities partly ''to insure that no one will suffer conviction for a charge more serious than assault.''"

These have not gone unnoticed: Weston has been remembered with a half-dozen museum shows, and Life has published a special commemorative issue and a book of its all-time greatest pictures. Two anniversaries in the realm of color photography, on the other hand, have not received all the attention they deserve. Fifty years ago, Kodak's Kodachrome film was made available in 35-millimeter size for color slides.

If your answer is somewhere between impossible and certain, you know as much as the scientists debating this question, and you probably know as much as anyone will know in your lifetime. Unless, that is, the international coterie of astronomers now engaged in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) finally does ''answer the greatest long-distance call in history,'' as Thomas R.

The setting for all this is the Casa de Campo resort in the Dominican Republic. What is probably the biggest and most varied vacation place in the Caribbean is, above all, a place of beauty and relaxation where the service is cheerful and efficient, the food is better than average and the pace of life is whatever you make it. The resort is set on 7,000 acres of gently rolling coastal land a little more than an hour from the international airport in Santo Domingo. The red tile roofs and stucco walls of the casitas and villas give Casa de Campo a Latin look and the mostly sunny and mild days are unmistakably island tropical."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Twenty-three students from four sixth-grade classes of the Ward School in New Rochelle recently had an unusual opportunity to experience life without electricity. In a day spent at Philipsburg Manor in North Tarrytown, they did farm chores, open-hearth cooking, milling and textile work as they would have in the 18th century. ''A Day Without Electricity'' comprised one aspect of a larger program, the goal of which is to increase the awareness by young people of electricity and its use. The other - and major - segment of the educational program was the introduction of a new computer software program, ''Watts in a Home,'' underwritten by the State Power Authority. The Power Authority, in conjunction with Teachers College, Columbia University, developed the program to teach middle-school and junior-high-school students about energy conservation. Through the work of ''Wattson the Robot'' - the ''star'' of the computer program - students can see how many watts of electricity each household appliance uses on a typical day. To complete the program, students have the option of turning various appliances on and off depending on energy needs; they must also maintain their budget and avoid ''blacking out'' through the use of too much energy."

It will allow the inmates to purchase $6,000 worth of equipment for the Taconic video center and to use the remaining $4,000 to develop a training tape for inmate tutors working with Literacy Volunteers, a national organization that provides volunteer tutors in reading and math in programs throughout the country.

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"PAINTING over a wall that has a rough or textured surface is seldom much of a problem. But trying to hang wallpaper over such a surface is much more difficult. The wall must be smoothed down first to create a reasonably sound and level surface that will be suitable for hanging. This is particularly a problem when dealing with walls that have been covered with grooved wood paneling or finished with a heavily stippled or textured-finish coating. Smoothing and leveling a rough wall is usually quite a chore - low spots, grooves and other depressions must be filled in, and high spots or rough areas must be sanded smooth. However, there is a much simpler method that can be used to prepare such walls for any regular wallcovering: Hang a type of heavy-duty lining fabric over the wall that is heavy-duty lining fabric over the wall that is specifically designed for ''problem'' walls of this kind. Although these lining materials are not new, most homeowners and even many professional painters are not familiar with them."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"IT was the start of the seven-day Feast of Lights, Hanukkah, and at dusk, as I took the large bronze menorah down from the mantle piece, memories came flooding in: Our home was always filled with countless uncles and aunts. While we saw less of Aunt Bella than of the other relatives, she was our great favorite and she never failed to join us for our Hanukkah celebration. I can still see her well-loved face before me, the light of the Hanukkah candles reflected in her thick glasses, and I can hear her deep voice joining in the Hanukkah song, Ma-oz Tzur. Aunt Bella, my father's youngest sister, was an odd contrast to the tall, handsome uncles and chic, vivacious aunts - indeed, an ugly duckling. But to us children Aunt Bella meant fun, games and unstinting love. From the moment she arrived and extricated herself from four pairs of arms - mine, my sister's and two brothers' - the house echoed with her booming laughter as we vied for the privilege of sitting next to her at dinner, or, best of all, on her lap at story time."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Something went wrong for the Plymouth red-bellied turtle centuries ago and the development of a modern industrial society in Massachusetts only made things worse. But now museums across the state are helping in an effort to build the numbers of the nearly extinct turtle, the only endangered animal in the state that is not found anywhere else. And the Federal and state governments have set aside about 180 acres on the edge of Plymouth, Mass., as the Massasoit National Wildlife Refuge, which contains part of its remaining range. These black, yellow-striped turtles, which weigh up to 10 pounds and live up to 55 years, are thought by wildlife experts to have ranged centuries ago to Ipswich, north of Boston, inland to Concord and out along Cape Cod to Provincetown, said Thomas W. French, a zoologist with the State Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. But their range has been so whittled down over the years that they are now found only in a small area centered in Plymouth."

Clemson (8-2-2) was insured the victory when Stanford's final chance ended when Greg Ennis underthrew an intended receiver on a fourth-down play with 1 minute 24 seconds to play. Coach Danny Ford said his Clemson team did not learn to finish off the enemy while watching the new Clint Eastwood movie, ''Heartbreak Ridge,'' on Friday night.

The latest procurement czar, Richard Godwin, a former Bechtel Corporation executive who was sworn in this fall, holds a newly created title, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition. He will be dealing with a system of developing and buying arms that has been altered dramatically in the years since the Reagan Administration's defense buildup began. Dozens of changes - intended to drive down prices, increase weapons reliability, speed up research and development, punish fraud and lend stability to roller-coaster production cycles, to name just a few goals - are being digested. Now many experts are hoping for a respite from reform, so the military-industrial complex can absorb the changes."

Thaper left his post as the administrator of 200 schools in his native Delhi, India, to pursue his education career in the United States, he had every reason to expect success. He had attended the University of Wisconsin in 1961 on a Fulbright scholarship, and now was going back there on a fellowship to earn his doctoral degree. His subsequent dissertation in the field of program budgeting in 1974 was called ''exceptionally well done and a significant contribution to the field'' by Dean Stephen J. Knezevich of the School of Education at the University of Southern California, one of those who conducted Dr. Thaper's oral examination. LLoyd E. Frohreich, professor of educational administration at the University of Wisconsin while Dr. Thaper was there, wrote that his work was ''exemplary,'' adding: ''Mr. Thaper is a congenial and delightful person to know. Although he was born and raised in a foreign country, he writes and speaks with more clarity and understanding than most American graduate students."

As is well known, the stereo should be listened to at full-room volume so as to approximate the sensation of being in a concert hall. Basically, that means loud. Loud enough to shake the floors and walls of a 30-year-old suburban split-level. At the same time, there should be no extraneous noise to distract you from the music."

Like the bauhaus motto, ''Form follows function,'' it is itself a memorable specimen of the minimalist esthetic, of which a cardinal principle is that artistic effect may be enhanced by a radical economy of artistic means, even where such parsimony compromises other values: completeness, for example, or richness or precision of statement. The power of that esthetic principle is easy to demonstrate: contrast my eminently forgettable formulation of it above - ''artistic effect may be enhanced,'' etc. - with the unforgettable assertion ''Less is more.'' Or consider the following proposition, first with, and then without, its parenthetical elements: Minimalism (of one sort or another) is the principle (one of the principles, anyhow) underlying (what I and many another interested observer consider to be perhaps) the most impressive phenomenon on the current (North American, especially the United States) literary scene (the gringo equivalent to el boom int he latin American novel): I mean the new flowering of the (North) American short story (in particular the kind of terse, oblique, realistic or hyperrealistic, slightly polotted, extrospective, cool-surfaced fiction associated int he last 5 to 10 years with such excellent writers as Frederick Barthelme, Ann Beattie, Raymond Carver, Bobbie Ann Mason, James robison, Mary Robison and Tobias Wolff, and both praised and damned under such labels as ''K-Mart realism,'' ''hick chic,'' ''Diet-Pepsi minimalism'' and ''post-Vietnam, post-literary, postmodernist blue-collar neo-early-Hemingwayism'')."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"THE town of Somers, already suffering growing pains from two new corporations building there and embroiled in both traffic and litigation, is now facing growth of another type: 1,136 new housing units, either in the concept stage or under construction. Eleven percent of the town's land - 2,200 acres of the town's total of 20,800 acres - would be developed if all the plans that are now before the town go through. Forty percent of the land available for development in the town currently is undeveloped. The new houses would increase the town's total of about 5,000 residences by 22 percent. Most of the houses would be clustered, a relatively new arrangement in the rural community. These statistics were gathered by David Fuller, of Fredrick P. Clark Associates, the town's planning consultants, in response to a request by the Planning Board, which has been engulfed with development proposals. The inventory is the first step toward a revision of the master plan, which the town has ordered because of the wave of growth."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"THERE were noisy, emotional and sometimes violent reactions last week to the enactment of a law that will largely halt prosecutions of Argentine military officers accused of human rights violations. But more notable, perhaps, was the indifference with which the law was greeted by most Argentines. They were concerned about Christmas and departures to the beach or countryside, so the opposition was left primarily to human rights groups and several small leftist political parties. Some observers here said this may indicate that many Argentines agreed with the military's argument that all share a burden for the excesses of an era in which doctors did not denounce torture, lawyers were afraid to file habeas corpus petitions, the Roman Catholic hierarchy was silent and the dominant newspapers generally took safe positions."

Community leaders, residents and officials have publicly praised the raid and the dozens of arrests. But privately they express concern that if the pressure is not kept up by the police, the drug problem will resume. For the people around Prospect Avenue in New Cassel, the evening of Oct. 28 was like every other night. Some were there just to hang out, but others sold drugs to buyers in passing cars. The dealing went on into the early morning hours, the sellers unaware that not far away, at Police Headquarters in Mineola, a lengthy investigation into the drug sales was coming to a head at a predawn briefing."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Reacting to the rapid development of this hilly city's wooded suburban outskirts, the City Council has adopted a moratorium on building outside its downtown in an effort to channel development toward the city center. The one-year measure enacted last month bars development of multi-family housing or large commercial buildings on the city's outskirts. It is a step more often taken by suburbs under the pressure of urban expansion. Several smaller cities in Massachusetts, like Amherst and Framingham, have had construction moratoriums in effect for several years, but Worcester, the second-largest city in New England, is the largest city in the region to enact such a restriction."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"WHILE politicians of all persuasions are lately encountering crowds of journalists seeking the latest details and comments on the Iran arms scandal, there are few radio reporters among them. But television reporters and camera crews fill the hearing rooms and news conferences, competing to fill expanded news shows. Once the backbone of electronic journalism and the first source of live reporting, radio news is on the skids. Its decline in many cases reflects a deliberate retreat by station owners who see cutting news as an easy way to reduce costs. In other instances the trend reflects acquiescence to ambitious television stations that have used video and satellite technology to gain the edge in local news."

The newsmen understood. The suspect, Mordechai Vanunu, was telling them that Israeli agents had kidnapped him in Rome on Sept. 30, after he had arrived there, apparently from London on a British Airways flight. The flashing took place on Sunday, but the Government censor had forbidden any publication of the message until Monday, and Israeli papers at first published pictures of the raised hand with the message blacked out by the censor's felt-tipped pen."

While unable to produce enough food or goods, the Hanoi Government maintains the world's third-largest standing army (after the Soviet Union and China), and uses it to subjugate its neighboring country, Cambodia - just the way the big boys used to treat Vietnam. The successors of the legendary Ho Chi Minh have made Vietnam a pariah among nations, almost entirely dependent on parsimonious Soviet patronage and continually threatened by its ancestral enemy, China."

That day, Rather called a meeting of the ''Evening News'' staff and gave them a locker-room pep talk - ''We're not going to feel sorry for ourselves, we're not going to let this get us down.''

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"''I thought there was some mistake,'' said Alain Cavalier about the response to his film ''Therese'' at its Cannes Film Festival premiere. The French director was hardly prepared for the awed reactions of the audience, the unanimous raves, and finally the awarding of the Special Jury Prize. ''When I made this film, I assumed it would be for a small audience,'' he said of his dramatic portrait of an adolescent saint. ''During the screening in Cannes, I left the theater because I didn't want to see people walking out.'' ''Therese,'' now playing at the Lincoln Plaza, was hailed as the revelation of this year's festival. Although the international press had been anticipating awards for some of the heavyweights - from ''The Mission'' to ''The Sacrifice'' - expectations were not running high for a low-budget, no-star, and hardly-contemporary story of faith. Indeed, the box-office figures for another French entry, ''Menage,'' had indicated that trendy cynicism and hyperbole were components for success in 1986."

But it is no secret that he has already thought about the White House and whether he can get there on the strength of a reputation in New England that has been sweetened with a blossoming local economy and a resounding re-election triumph. Mr. Dukakis won his third term on Nov. 4, the day after his 53d birthday, with the biggest victory margin of any Massachusetts governor in this century. He was helped in part by an economy so strong that it has created a labor shortage in eastern Massachusetts and a budget surplus so large that disposing of it may have been his biggest political problem in 1986."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"OPEC's agreement to slash output by 7 percent in the first half of 1987 sent oil prices above $17 a barrel for the first time since September. OPEC's target is $18 a barrel, but most analysts say the spurt in prices was an overreaction to the OPEC agreement. Reached after two weeks of disharmonious talks led by Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and the chairman of OPEC, the agreement requires all members except Iraq to cut production. More significantly, it requires them to adhere to a price system for crude products that analysts say will not likely be followed. Other OPEC agreements have failed as members - fearful of losing revenues - cheated on quotas or undercut pricing agreements. The effect of any increase on heating oil and gasoline prices remains uncertain, however, because those refined products often do not respond until crude prices stabilize. But most analysts expect at least slight increases at the pump, possibly dampening Americans' new-found enthusiasm for driving."

''We need a Clean Soil Act,'' says Dr. Ellen Silbergeld, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund. ''Soil is a really bad actor because it is a major source of exposure to heavy metals like lead and other toxic substances.'' Dr. Barry L. Johnson, associate administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry of the United States Public Health Service, agrees, citing ''a lot of research on air and water pollution but not much on soil.''"

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The bloody New Year's Day riot at the West Virginia Penitentiary, followed by months of unrest, turned 1986 into the most violent year at the prison in 26 years. Prisoners took control of an entire wing, holding 15 guards and one other worker hostage. By the time it was over two days later, three prisoners had been killed, correction officials had signed an agreement with the prisoners and Gov. Arch A. Moore had met with the inmates after they released the hostages and returned to their cells. Since then, 6 prisoners have been killed and 12 injured at the 120-year-old prison in Moundsville."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Love Is Sweet as Blue It's reassuring to reflect that love letters continue to exist. In ''Ceremony'' (Henry Holt), the anthropologist Nigel Barley describes the style of the amatory epistle in a North African village. The young are particularly a prey to scribal insecurity and a whole sub-industry provides love letters for all occasions. These are passed around between college students with a rapidity and fervour reserved in our own schools for works of dire pornography."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"MATISSE The Man and His Art, 1869-1918. By Jack Flam. Illustrated. 523 pp. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press. $75. THE life of Henri Matisse doesn't offer much in the way of drama, and Matisse's painting and sculpture, though radiant with feeling, are just a tad impersonal. The Olympian clarity of his art depends on a certain denial of the autobiographical impulse. Matisse is one of those artists - more in the line of Raphael than of Michelangelo - who are reluctant to leave shreds of undigested feeling hanging around. In the midst of his gigantic achievement, it may seem foolish to regret the absence of a more personal note; but Matisse can sometimes project the off-putting, holier-than-thou aura of one of those great writers who have burned - or have meant to burn - all their personal papers. Matisse would probably be glad to know that more than 30 years after his death the relationship between his art and his life looks as elusive as ever. The basic paradoxes remain: he is still the timid slow starter who went farther than almost any other artist of his age; he is still the conventional-mannered bourgeois - people called him ''Professor,'' ''Doctor'' - who smashed every convention of bourgeois art."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"There appears to be revived interest in both Expressionist art in general and, specifically, in the Expressionist modern dance that flourished in Germany until the Nazis squelched it in the 30's. Expressionism is the inspiration for Phyllis Lamhut's ''Klein Kunst (Small Art),'' which the Phyllis Lamhut Dance Company presents Sunday afternoon and Monday, Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights at the Bessie Schonberg Theater."

Music and parades are a constant, but every culture puts its own stamp on carnival, which may embrace just the few days before Ash Wednesday (March 4 next year) all the way to Cologne's 17-week marathon: Mardi Gras and Jouvert, Sambadrome and Vivaldi, the Women's Carnival and even survivals of pre-Christian Roman feasts.

Tonight, after being defeated three times in previous meetings with the Islanders, the Penguins at least gained a 3-3 tie. The Islanders seemed on their way to victory until Dan Quinn tied the game with the Pittsburgh goalie pulled and just 28 seconds left in regulation at the Civic Arena. The Islanders, who had swept the Penguins in a November series and stunned them in a come-from-behind overtime victory Tuesday at Nassau Coliseum, scored three straight second-period goals tonight to wipe out a 1-0 Penguin lead."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"''New York without a theater district might as well be Newark,'' cracked a jaded taxi driver in the comedy that opened 1986, Terrence McNally's ''It's Only a Play.'' Twelve months later, Times Square is still unlikely to be confused with the Garden State, but does anyone doubt that the New York theater district is less a place than a state of mind, as hard to pin down as ''the oldest established permanent floating crap game'' of ''Guys and Dolls''? The most warming new American play of 1986, Tina Howe's ''Coastal Disturbances,'' is to be found in a living-room-sized auditorium two flights up from ''The Common Pursuit,'' 30-odd blocks north of Shubert Alley. The year's boldest musical theater experiment, Martha Clarke's ''Vienna: Lusthaus,'' was born in the tiny St. Clement's, in the shadows of the Broadway periphery, before finding a berth at the Public downtown. The most original performer Broadway has seen in ages, Robert Lindsay of ''Me and My Girl,'' turned up innocently at the neighborhood's most widely despised venue - the antiseptic hotel auditorium that usurped three venerable playhouses - and, like it or not, legitimized the place as a theater. And who would have imagined that a 1971 Off Broadway hit by John Guare, ''The House of Blue Leaves,'' would reawaken both the Newhouse and Beaumont theaters at Lincoln Center before moving south for its belated midtown debut?"
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The cost of paying interest on the Federal debt has leveled off after rising rapidly for more than 25 years and may even decline in the current fiscal year, according to budget experts in the Reagan Administration and Congress. Although the Government is borrowing more, it is paying less in interest as a result of a dramatic decline in interest rates that has in effect produced a windfall for the Administration. Interest payments have long been considered one of the biggest uncontrollable elements in the Federal budget. When the Government borrows money and agrees to pay interest, it incurs a legally binding obligation and would risk default if it failed to pay the full amount of interest due at a particular time."

Mr. Smith and Mr. Spignesi assert that there is a ''severe overpopulation of deer'' in the forest. By what measure? In 1984, population estimates went from 200 to 500 in three days' time as we pressed for evidence for ''overpopulation.'' By October of this year, Mr. Smith was using a figure of 540. Mr. Spignesi now says there are 360 deer."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"WHEN Dr. Joel Clifford Newman asked a few dozen friends and potential business clients over for some Christmas cheer and buffet earlier this month, they came not to his fifth-floor condominium apartment at the Kingsley but to the Sky Lounge on the 31st floor. It was for exactly this purpose that the lounge, complete with kitchen and bar, was incorporated into the 217-unit apartment house at 400 East 70th Street when it was built two years ago - to allow tenants to throw parties that they could not accommodate in their own small apartments. ''There are limitations to apartment living in Manhattan, such as catering to large numbers of people,'' said Dr. Newman, a physician who is a biomedical-technology analyst at Salomon Brothers, the investment banking house. ''You also don't want a crowd of people messing up your apartment and breaking things.'' Other advantages, he said, were the modest $150 charge for the use of the facilities and the pleasing vistas eastward over Manhattan and Queens as far as Shea Stadium. But the main advantage that he and other tenants of the 30 or so Manhattan apartment houses with communal social rooms emphasized was the convenience of being able to entertain in one's own building."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"SINCE the 19th century, Chinese scholars have been debating how to preserve their country's ''Chineseness'' while at the same time embracing Western science and technology. Some Confucian scholars used to argue that Western scientific knowledge was only a tool that could in the end be used to strengthen traditional values. But others insisted that opening the doors would inexorably erode and destroy the Confucian ethos. Last week, as tens of thousands of students marched through Shanghai's narrow streets shouting slogans for democracy and freedom, the dilemma facing China's leaders was much like the one that had troubled Confucian traditionalists. For as China methodically opens itself, creating an economic landscape akin to the West's, intellectuals are asking: Can the political principles that nourish Western economies be far behind? And if so, what does that entail for the Communist Government and its political values?"

The city's 20 squares of parks, landscaped with palmetto trees, azaleas and native flowers and shaded by giant live oaks, are spaced throughout the heart of the city, and the single-lane streets that encircle the squares carry traffic one way only. The mansions clustered around the squares evoke a period of antebellum self-confidence and extravagance. In winter, the squares are uncrowded and it is easy to survey the city's surpassingly lovely landscape. House Museums Three of the most elegant and sophisticated houses in Savannah were designed by a young Englishman from Bath, the fashionable watering place of Jane Austen's England. William Jay designed and oversaw the building of these three Regency houses at a time when Savannah's economy was experiencing a great cotton boom. The Owens-Thomas House (124 Abercorn Street; 912-233-9743), considered one of the best examples of Regency architecture in the United States, is a fawn-colored, two-story stone building completed in 1819. In the dining room, there is an ingenious indirect lighting system and on the second level a graceful wooden bridge connects the front and rear of the house. The house is open Tuesday through Saturday, from 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.; Sunday and Monday, from 2 to 4:30 P.M. Admission is $3; $2 for students."

Some facts are not in dispute: a group of white youths at a party, hearing that three blacks were walking through their community, chased and beat them with a baseball bat, a tree limb and fists. One victim, Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old construction worker, was killed by a car as he fled across a busy highway. But as the investigation of the case has unfolded, gaps and contraditions have emerged, leaving elements of mystery and doubt over many of the things that happened on the night of Dec. 19-20 and in the tense aftermath of the episode. Some questions involve the roles of the assailants, including three white teen-agers charged with second-degree murder, and of the motorist whose car killed Mr. Griffith. Others pertain to the victims. Still others arise from apparent contradictions in accounts by the police and by witnesses."

By the time the sculptors are finished, the ice cream magnates Ben and Jerry will be 160 miles away, concocting 800 pounds of cherries jubilee for 3,000 people in Albany. They plan to ignite the confection at nightfall. Across the country, extravagant events like these will occur simutaneously on New Year's Eve in cities that have organized First Night celebrations. Although the practice of holding a citywide arts celebration -in which public and private spaces are turned over for one night to artists - originated in Boston, where it is in its 11th year, other cities have recently adopted the idea. This year's new First Night cities include, in addition to Albany, York, Pa.; New Bedford, Mass.; Charlotte, N.C.; San Francisco and Milwaukee."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"ON Dec. 31, you will find me slipping into the approaching year as comfortably as a child into mittens, but it wasn't always that way. When I was younger, I was haunted by that universal law: a girl over the age of 15 must have a date on New Year's Eve. This didn't pose problems for the sweater girls, who looked cute in bobby sox and saddle shoes - the girls so neatly impersonated by Kathleen Turner on the screen. They had boyfriends, wore makeup and were invited to so many parties they bounced from one to the other."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"When Vinson Cole makes his Metropolitan Opera debut on Saturday, it will be one more of his frequent appearances as a pinch-hitter, a not unusual phase at this point in an operatic career, but one that he hopes is about to give way to a steadier diet of first-time-around appearances. ''This year, I've become the tenor who jumps in for indisposed tenors in the Verdi Requiem,'' Mr. Cole said with a laugh at lunch last week, referring to recent performances with Carlo Maria Giulini in Berlin and a few weeks ago in Chicago with Claudio Abbado. ''And I was asked to substitute for Pavarotti in the last of four Requiems by the New York Philharmonic on Dec. 16, but I was already covering - for the tenor in 'Fledermaus' at the Met, - and they wouldn't release me.'' It is in ''Die Fledermaus,'' in fact, that Mr. Cole will make his Met debut, as the second Eisenstein of the season in the new production of the Strauss opera. He also will step in as Rodolfo for the season's final ''La Boheme'' in the house in April and during the company's tour of city parks in June."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"THIS year brought the greatest surge in sales of new closed-end investment funds since the late 1920's - about $4 billion worth. While that made a banner year for Wall Street underwriters and the fund managers, results for investors who bought into most of the 28 new funds have been disappointing. All of the largest issues are trading below the prices of their initial public offerings. The dismal tally is no surprise to professionals accustomed to the risks of I.P.O.'s. In August, Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. led an underwriting group that distributed $60 million worth of the World Wide Value Fund Inc., at $20 a share. After underwriting fees of $1.50 and portfolio losses, the net asset value of the multi-country fund has slumped to about $17, the share price to $15. Investors who bought on the initial offering in August have lost 25 percent."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Thousands of Orthodox Jewish women who have received civil divorces remain unable to remarry because their husbands are unwilling to grant them traditional Jewish divorces, according to Jewish leaders. And since only the husband can grant the divorce - known as a Get - many Jewish wives have become victims of recalcitrant husbands who refuse, some out of spite, others for blackmail and extortion, according to statements at a recent forum on Jewish divorce and civil law. ''This problem has left thousands of devout Jewish women in a painful marital limbo,'' a co-sponsor of the forum, City Council President Andrew J. Stein, told more than 300 women, matrimonial lawyers and rabbis gathered at the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. Estimating that there are 15,000 of these women in New York State alone, Jewish leaders noted that in the closed, relatively autonomous Jewish communities of the past, religious authorities could level effective sanctions against a husband. In modern times, however, the rabbinical courts have authority only over those people who voluntarily submit themselves to its dictates."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"ONCE, the musical theater was ruled by Americans. The English, it was believed, had no knack for creating and producing musicals with flair. The success of ''Oliver!'' proved an exception. Now that the American musical is in jeopardy and the English seem to have cornered the new Broadway song-and-dance market, ''Oliver!'' first presented in London in 1960 and then in New York in 1963, remains an exception, though of a new and different sort."

Goulet scored his 20th goal of the season after taking a pass from Jason Lafreniere and firing a shot from the slot that beat Chevrier to his stick side.
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"I have long been a fan of the genre Richard M. Levine writes about in his article ''Murder, They Write'' (Nov. 16). What draws me to these books, besides the fact that they contain all the elements of a fast-paced whodunit, is the alluring, disturbing fact that the stories are true and could happen right in one's own backyard."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"MENTION salary arbitration and club officials will recoil in horror. It is just about that time again - eligible players can begin filing next Monday - but to the owners and general managers, it seems like only yesterday (10 months ago, actually) that Orel Hershiser was winning a $1 million salary after earning $212,000 the previous year and Bret Saberhagen was grabbing a $925,000 prize after pitching one season earlier for $160,000. Hershiser, they will tell you even if you didn't ask, had a 14-14 record this year and Saberhagen was 7-12. The club officials still feel the pain. Club officials do not like salary arbitration, never have. George Steinbrenner recently called it the ''real cancer, the villain'' of players' salaries that owners are methodically trying to lower. The owners know they can't make arbitration disappear, but they are trying to do something about it. The Player Relations Committee, the owners' labor arm, has commissioned a study of the arbitration procedure by two university professors. The P.R.C. hasn't publicized the existence of the study, but in a recent report to the clubs, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, the committee said, ''In conducting the study, we've asked the professors to focus primarily on how to make the present system work better for the clubs. The study will also suggest changes which could be proposed to the Players Association during the next basic agreement negotiations.''"
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"RELATIVELY few summertime hiker-naturalists are abroad when the forests and mountains are deep in snow, and this is a pity because there is much to be seen at that time of year. Long before rope tows and lifts were hauling marvelously attired downhill skiers to the summits of hills and mountains, hardy, dedicated groups of winter enthusiasts were touring forest and meadow on snowshoes or heavy, hand-crafted slabs of hickory or ash, and their descendants continue the tradition, albeit with superior equipment. It is the snow and cold that stops most people, but proper clothing, skis or snowshoes -and a dash of caution and maps and compass if one is planning an extended tour - are all that is needed to enter a sparse and wondrous world of white in which earth-bound creatures leave their signatures for all to see and decipher, and the riotous greenery of warmer months is stripped from the forest, baring the essential shapes of trees and shrubs. Many winter wanderers are content to be exercising, paying only casual attention to the world about them. But a little curiosity - a few pauses in the rush from place to place - can add spice to the endeavor."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"A brilliancy prize is a grand thing even if it won't pay the rent. It expresses appreciation for the exceptionally creative, imaginative performance that everyone delights in but cannot expect to see often. Whereas first prize in a tournament is awarded to the player who fights his way through to the top in game after game - no matter how -the brilliancy prize is given for producing four or five glorious hours in one day. It is usually set at approximately 1/20th of the first prize."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"This was a year when small gifts seemed to be the biggest blessings. There was no new esthetic, no dominating style, no giant sale of photographs to the J. Paul Getty Museum. But there was enough activity in terms of pictures on the walls to make categorization necessary. Here, then, are the year's highlights: Really big pictures: ''The Real Big Picture,'' organized by Marvin Heiferman for the Queens Museum last January, challenged the notion of photography as a medium unto itself better than any other exhibition to date. The show included 50 artists whose allegiances lie primarily with the tradition of painting and sculpture, not photography, and as it happened their photographs are mostly much larger than lap size. But size was not the real point of ''The Real Big Picture''; the future of photography as an art was. Mr. Heiferman's essay also contained one of the year's most provocative lines: ''Photography's true gift may not be the closeness it provides, but the distance it allows.''"
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"If you fancy horseback riding through countryside around an abandoned limestone quarry once owned by Thomas A. Edison, a new residential development in Franklin Township, N.J., may be just the place. Tentatively called the Cliffs at Emerald Lake, after what is to be the new name of the larger of its two quarry-formed lakes, the development is planned as three separate villages with an equestrian theme on 536 acres bounded by Edison, Stewartsville and Good Springs Road that were used around the turn of the century by the Edison Cement Works."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"ON Nov. 19, 1985, the headline in a local newspaper announced: ''$225,225: Average Price of a Home in Westchester Hits New High.'' By July 12, 1986, the headline read: ''Westchester Home Price: $301,239.'' To purchase such a home today would require a minimum annual income of $130,000. Yet according to the 1980 Census, the average household income in Westchester County was $29,626. The County Planning Department's revised figure for 1984 was $37,434. The fact that there is a housing crisis in Westchester has been amply documented and there is growing realization that single young professionals, young families and the elderly can't find housing. But the implications of the crisis on the quality of life in the county may not be fully grasped. It is also a fact that the housing shortage has a direct effect on the employment market and the future economic health of the county. Notice the number of ''Help Wanted'' signs on supermarkets, all kinds of small retail shops, even in the larger malls."

She seems small and vulnerable against the bleak backdrop of high-rise buildings of the Robert Taylor Homes, where 20,000 residents, virtually all black, live in concentrated poverty. Her first child is expected in February. The unmarried teen-ager, who lives in the project with her mother and some of her nine sisters and brothers, admits she is worried about feeding and caring for an infant. But she is comforted now, knowing that her child, even before birth, is eligible for an innovative program of benefits and services for all babies born next year in 6 of the 28 Taylor houses. About 125 to 150 children are expected to qualify. Most will be born to unwed teen-agers."

With the score tied at 65-65, Loyola (5-3) scored the next 10 points, including a 3-point play by Gerald Hayward and a 3-point basket by Jackson, to take a 75-65 lead with 7 minutes 39 seconds left."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Sports Editor: Regarding the recent survey of pro football fans (''Fans Perceive Rise in Injuries,'' The New York Times, Dec. 21), the poll focused on the cause of injuries rather than the impact of injuries on the game. The bottom line, unfortunately, is that no longer does the best team win - the most desired result in any sport - but the team(s) that can survive the season relatively injury-free have the best chance of success. Decimation is the rule rather than the exception, and it will steadily worsen. HERB BODENSTEIN The Bronx"

But he said in an interview that he would continue to seek ''the liberation of prisoners of conscience.'' ''This is an area where I cannot spare my efforts,'' he said. The interview was one of a series he has been giving to Western reporterssince he returned Tuesday from exile in the city of Gorky.

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Watching the crowds at the year's three most conspicuous popular successes - ''Vienna 1900'' at the Museum of Modern Art, ''Henri Matisse: The Early Years in Nice'' at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and ''Van Gogh in Saint-Remy and Auvers'' at the Metropolitan Museum - we cannot imagine them as even partial failures, but in point of fact it is by a mysterious process, akin to alchemy, that an exhibition becomes unforgettable. Size alone is no guarantee. We can all remember huge undertakings, hugely subsidized, that went nowhere in particular. Timing can be important. People stood in line this year to see what they would not have crossed the road to see 10 years ago. Magic is magic, and cannot be willed into existence. A memorable surprise, in that context, was the exhibition of Indian sculpture and painting at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco that was the final event in the Festival of India, which made itself felt in almost every state in the union. Unlike almost all the other events in the festival, this was made up entirely of very superior loans from India. Arranged according to categories of feeling, from euphoria to dejection, the sculptures were displayed and lit in ways that had an exceptional immediacy. Of the distanced formality of conventional museum practice, there was never a trace."

Concern for loss of face could also have been a factor, the article suggests on the basis of interviews with the pilot, Capt. Y. M. Park, and other pilots from the airline. Captain Park, now retired, is quoted as saying that he radioed the pilot of the doomed plane to ask why his flight was slipping behind schedule. The answer from the pilot of Flight 007, Capt. S. I. Chun, was, ''The wind is strong.'' This indicated to Captain Park that something was not right aboard, the article says."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The Chinese have the charming habit of naming their years after animals - the Year of the Rat, the Year of the Tiger, and so forth. If the past year in audio were to be characterized in this way, it might well be called the Year of the Badger. It was a time for the cozy consolidation of past gains, of curling up comfortably in one's lair to mull over noble adventures gone before. The noblest adventure of recent years has been, of course, the advent of digital recording early in the decade, and in 1986 the audio industry was still, in various ways, catching up with that momentous step. For example, during the last year intensive engineering efforts were aimed at fortifying amplifiers and loudspeakers against the more strenuous demands of digital sound. The period of consolidation, therefore, was not exactly a matter of resting upon laurels. Rather, the year was devoted to bringing important design details into line with the general standards of the digital era."

The plane crash-landed on a remote Saudi airfield and burst into flames after a shootout on board between the hijackers and security guards and the explosion of several grenades. The Saudi authorities have said that there were 107 people on the plane and that at least 62 were killed. Other sources have said there were fewer passengers, and reports on fatalities varied.

The events - in Howard Beach, Queens, N.Y.; Jefferson Parish, La., and Arizona - and their aftermaths tell us a lot about racial relations. In all three cases, individuals who had spoken or acted against black people or their interests or symbols found that disapproval of their acts was far from universal and that indeed they had many supporters. The most recent event was the beating of three young black men by a group of white teen-agers in Howard Beach and the subsequent death of one."

Well, I'm no gambler either, but I'll bet that you're a speculator or a dealer in speculations. Otherwise, why are you - and I - reading the business pages? Sure, there are bits and pieces of news that have some bearing on our businesses, but most of the stories, all of the gossip and all of the pages of tables and graphs interest us mainly because of what we grandly call our investments. ''Nonsense,'' you are probably saying. ''I am a prudent investor, in for the long term. I put my money into a mutual fund and let it grow. I don't fiddle with options or futures, and I'm philosophically opposed to program trading, even if I don't understand how it works.''"

Clarfeld of Clarfeld & Company, a Manhattan accounting firm that specializes in financial planning for executives. For one thing, with taxes on capital gains rising to a maximum 28 percent in 1987, from 20 percent now, many asset-rich owners have been cashing in appreciated stock, real estate and even their businesses, while many professionals profited by helping them cut the deals. One of Mr. Clarfeld's clients, a young investment banker, received a bonus check for $1.5 million. Aside from the huge year-end bonuses that have become customary on Wall Street in the 80's, increasing numbers of people are earning large sums of money over a relatively short working span -entrepreneurs, models, actors and professional athletes, for example. ''People are moving in and out of the top in a shorter time,'' said Gary N. Skoloff, a Newark family lawyer with a high-income clientele. ''When they flop, there is nothing left.''"

Mr. Reagan made the broadcast on the day he arrived here from Washington for a weeklong vacation in Los Angeles and Palm Springs, Calif. Before he left Washington, the White House issued a statement in which the President urged the Soviet Union to offer a ''realistic timetable'' for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.

The transport for this journey is appropriate - the horse, one of the small, agile, surefooted horses typical of Provencal stock, fitted with randonnee saddles - lighter versions of the Western saddle characterized by a small horn in front, a slightly built-up seat and long stirrup that is comfortable for extended periods. The trip originates in Marseilles and proceeds by bus to Chateau-Arnoux. From there, on horseback for four or five hours daily, it proceeds to Banon, Roussillon, Lauris, Mallemart and Salon-de-Provence before returning to Marseilles by bus. Three of these horseback tours are scheduled next year by Butterfield & Robinson, a tour operator whose offerings in various parts of the world also include walking trips, bicycle trips and cross-country ski touring."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"AFTER one of the sharpest budget debates in years, the Board of Legislators last week approved a $770.8 million spending plan for 1987 that cuts $3.6 million from the proposal made by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke in mid-November but raises the property tax rate by 8.7 percent. It cuts about 55 unfilled positions from the county payroll, a major concession to complaints this year about a ''phantom army'' of nearly 1,000 funded but vacant county jobs, and reduces the spending for the Hudson River Museum, the Council for the Arts and the Youth Bureau. It provides funds to begin work on a countywide 911 emergency telephone system, kills the start of a geographic information system in the Department of Planning and initiates a rent subsidy fund to help tenants facing eviction, to avoid adding to the county's homeless population. The $1 million ''pilot project to prevent homelessness,'' which the legislators said should reduce the county's obligation to provide costlier motel and hotel accomodation for the homeless, is under study by administration officials who have until Jan. 15 to prepare a plan of operation."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Bob Graham's Dec. 11 Op-Ed article on the candidate's campaign shows one state's evolving election experience. While Florida may be focusing on the glitz and blitz of television to conduct campaigns, there are still places in this country where the people do control the process and the media have not encroached on an influential electorate. Although the second smallest state might not be typical, a 1984 race for an at-large Congressional seat in Delaware convinced me that old-fashioned electioneering still thrives. To me, as a campaign press secretary for the Republican candidate in that race, it was clear that Delaware voters, much to their satisfaction, had their politicians at their beck and call."

Mr. Jones is the society's first black director and at 38 years old, its youngest administrator. The organization, which is supported by an endowment and government and private funds, has assets of $86 million, up from $60 million two years ago, largely as a result of the strength of the stock market. It has an operating budget of $8.5 million."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"CONNOISSEURS of great singing - any singing, in any style - are hereby directed to the Mark Hellinger Theater, 51st Street west of Broadway, where Smokey Robinson opened a run Friday night that will extend through New Year's Eve. Mr. Robinson has been with us, off and on (he had a commercial dry patch in the late 1970's), since 1960. Now 46 years old, his voice is still recognizably what it was 26 years ago, however much it's darkened and developed. His style has changed, too, but if anything that has simply improved over the years. Since the hallmarks of any great singer are a pleasing, individual set of tonal characteristics allied with a penetrating musicality and sense of style, and since Mr. Robinson has all those attributes in excelsis, he becomes by definition a great singer. And without belaboring the point, that greatness is absolute - not confined, ghetto-fashion, to ''popular music.''"
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Everybody supposedly loves a bargain. Without making a firm commitment, however, it is often difficult to tell whether a supposed bargain is as good as it may initially seem. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in advertisements, handbills, mass mailings and telephone campaigns that promise large discounts in travel and entertainment if you provide a credit-card number and make a deposit or pay a form of dues in advance. The wise traveler should not necessarily avoid such offerings automatically but examine them carefully, especially before you authorize any-one to charge anything to a credit-card account. If you have authorized a charge and are later unable to get a refund that you feel is warranted, your only recourse might be to consult the company that issued the card about laws that protect you in such circumstances. Two prominently advertised offerings of the last year serve as examples. Based on information from law-enforcement and watchdog agencies, legality is not at issue. Travel and Leisure World Club This year-old organization first attracted widespread attention last spring with newspaper advertisements promising 30 percent savings on dining and up to 30 percent on travel. One ad was simply a coupon requesting a membership application. A week after I mailed one in, I received a packet of material from the club at 225 West 34th Street, Suite 2203, New York, N.Y. 10122 (212-239-4855)."

''African art is rarely seen out here,'' said Rosalind Jeffries, the guest curator responsible for putting together ''The Artists' Language: African Traditional and Modern Art,'' now on display at the Nassau County Museum of Fine Art in Roslyn Harbor.

The establishments, most of them owned by Korean-Americans, go by the name ''Oriental Spa'' or ''Health Club'' and offer ''body shampoo'' and ''shiatsu.'' Officials say, however, that most of them offer prostitutes to their clients. According to city officials, about 20 of them moved to such neighborhoods as Murray Hill, Gramercy Park and Chelsea in the last three years, seeking to avoid prosecution by the city's Office of Midtown Enforcement."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"AFTER watching a battery-powered television set at the local school, villagers in the Ivory Coast, the West African nation, were asked to comment. A brooding old man inquired: ''Why are whites always stabbing, shooting and punching one another?'' The baffled elder's question, in the largely traditional village of N'zikpi, might have popped up in any of the two dozen or so African countries that have set up television stations but find themselves without enough programs of their own. Almost without exception, they have fallen back on Western soap operas such as ''Dynasty'' and ''Dallas,'' which are easily available but clearly not tailored for a non-English or French-speaking audience unfamiliar with Western notions of entertainment. Result: a cultural conflict that, along with perennial lack of cash and political restraints, hampers the growth of a communications medium with great potential for Africa."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The big ongoing story came only at the end of the year. The Iran arms affair took over news broadcasts and showed signs that it would remain. In a curious, even perverse, way, this was a relief. Think quickly now: When were Reykjavik, Bitburg and Bhopal? Was the midterm election this year or last? Great events, big scandals and terrible tragedies are disposable commodities on television; it is the nature of the medium to hasten on to other matters. News is speeded up, so to speak, and leaves behind mostly images. Reykjavik (or was it Geneva?) was a cold correspondent in a trenchcoat; Bitburg was a row of cemetery markers. This is unsatisfactory. Surely there should be more. How do we make sense of what is happening? What saves us, and also saves television, are the intermittent shafts of light. Someone pauses for thought."

''The shock came when somebody entered the house, saw the new candles and offered to purchase them for $2,'' Mr. Kittredge recalled. ''That was all the applause I needed. I went right out, bought more wax and sure enough, sold some more candles.'' This year, Mr. Kittredge's company, Yankee Candle Inc., the self-proclaimed largest producer of handmade candles in the world, made some 30 million candles and took in revenues of $6.5 million.

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"THE FIRST COMING How the Kingdom of God Became Christianity. By Thomas Sheehan. 287 pp. New York: Random House. $18.95. THOMAS SHEEHAN is a philosopher whose effort to construct a ''postmodern and postliberal'' interpretation of the meaning of Jesus aroused considerable debate even before ''The First Coming'' was published. Along with many other works of modern theology, this book provides an interpretation of the Gospels that supports and legitimizes secular philosophical thought in the context of theological debate, in this case the ''hermeneutical'' method. In what represents a more radical pattern of exegesis, the work joins a growing corpus of contemporary Catholic treatments of Jesus that finds in the Gospels no basis for major elements of Catholic dogma. ''The First Coming'' endorses the disarray within Catholicism as a hopeful sign that the Church - and the distinction between God and man - will dissolve to usher in the Kingdom that Jesus actually proclaimed. Expertly documented and compellingly written, it is likely to be stimulating even for those who, on account of some stubborn, sentimental or superstitious attachment to the idea of Jesus as the Christ, cannot respond to the sound of this trumpet."

The man behind him had about 400 containers in three shopping carts. All the people in line said they collected returnable bottles and cans for a living. In the more than three years since New York instituted a ''bottle bill,'' the nickels returned on deposits have become an important source of income for thousands of poor people, particularly in New York City, said Benjamin A.

People have become very good at playing the hypotheticals over the past month or so.'' The reason for the upsurge in such speculation - actually the use of convenient fictions that allow people to ask questions about their own situations - is the sweeping immigration legislation that became law Nov. 6. Many of the bill's key provisions, most notably the amnesty program for illegal aliens who entered the country before Jan. 1, 1982, are not yet in effect. The amnesty program begins May 5. But the new law promises such dramatic changes in patterns of living that it has set off an extraordinary surge of apprehension and confusion, turning the nation's Hispanic communities into rumor mills finely attuned to pick up every report about it."

The nightly routine was informal, with worry about Kenny the Cop ranking right up there with worry about missed shifts. But it was fun. It also was long ago, and the cars -most of them gutsy-sounding Fords - weren't really that fast, zero-to-60 taking maybe 10 seconds. Today's performers are a lot hotter than that, but even they seem ponderously slow compared with the automobile that another Kenny, this one named Bernstein, drives on dragstrips all over the country."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Writing about Chekhov's first extant full-length play, Henri Troyat (in his biography, ''Chekhov'') says, ''For all its melodrama, chaos and verbosity, this immature work contains all the great Chekhovian themes in embryo.'' Acting as Chekhov's collaborator and editor, Michael Frayn has reduced the melodrama, trimmed the verbosity and made the chaos seem more comic. The result, ''Wild Honey,'' is one of those rare adaptations that is faithful to the spirit, if not the letter, of the original. The play draws strength from the dual authorship - the young Chekhov's ebullience and incipient sensibility, combined with Mr. Frayn's knowledge of dramaturgy. If Chekhov had had the time and the inclination to revise and polish his early play, it might have become ''Wild Honey'' - the comedy that Chekhov never wrote."

In 1982, Representative Bill Green, Republican of Manhattan, asked the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation to use the Lower East Side to demonstrate new redevelopment programs. The organization, established by Congress to help rebuild cities, hesitated for two years because it felt it did not have anything realistic to offer the pockmarked neighborhood. But in 1984 the group determined that an appropriate response would be to test the concept of mutual housing, a type of collective ownership that would build and manage low- and moderate-income rental apartments. While the mutual-housing concept is new to the United States, it has been popular in Germany, where such associations run more than 4 million dwelling units. With the help of government representatives and private-sector financial and construction experts, residents form a nonprofit organization to build or rehabilitate low- and moderate-income apartments in several buildings. Prospective tenants pay a fee to join the association and also pay monthly dues - in effect, rent - to the association, which uses the revenues to cover all costs."

But no matter how quiet, or even nonexistent, current celebrations are, there's usually at least one memorable eve in most people's backgrounds. For Ann and Bob Shanks, New Yorkers brought up in the era of Carole Lombard-Clark Gable movies and transplanted to Los Angeles for several years, it was the year they decided to celebrate in what they considered the traditional Hollywood way."

More recently, writing as Robert Campbell, he came out with ''The Junkyard Dog,'' one of the best crime paperbacks of 1986. His hand has not deserted him here. The book introduces a private eye named Whistler, who is a rather nondescript type. Nevertheless, he is a pure, if somewhat aging, white knight who feels impelled to ferret out the truth even when there is nothing in it for him. Indeed, when at the end he adds up his expenses he is deep in the hole. That's life. As his friend Bosco, the philosopher who runs a coffee shop, reminds him, there are certain other inalienable truths. Iron rusts. And you should never try to eat the holes in Swiss cheese."

Historically speaking, Einstein and Thomas Alva Edison would be left behind to plod at their mundane tasks - bored, distracted and disturbing.

Like many adolescents, Flora struggles to make sense of the adult world, whose complications most actual adults seem unable to master after a lifetime of practice. She has the added burden of her father, an airplane pilot turned realtor whose bullying temper keeps the whole family in a permanent state of low-level terror. Henry Jackson, with a face ''like a thin piece of wrinkled gray leather'' and a mouth ''like a zipped-up zipper slit,'' cuffs his children, hides their toys and skates, and keeps a pistol underneath his mattress. Small wonder that Flora withdraws from the family: sometimes, she thinks, ''it was as though she had been anesthetized and kidnapped and she had just come to.''"
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Most analysts of the Administration's actions in Iran have spoken of President Reagan's excessive delegation of authority or of his preoccupation with the hostages. But in some respects the Administration's handling of the ''opening'' toward Iran betrays a flaw that has been common among many Administrations: the assumption that an expression of good will on our part is important in modifying the behavior of hostile regimes. Americans tend to believe in good will: if we show interest in making a deal, the other side will be equally accommodating. Such a notion comes naturally to a commercial nation that thrives, in the business and political worlds, on making deals - on reaching agreements considered beneficial to both parties."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In Howell Raines's review of David J. Garrow's ''Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference'' (Nov. 30), Mr. Raines refers to the ''inner torments King suffered because of his compulsive sexual adventuring'' and suggests that King's actions in this regard may have been related to the civil-rights leader's desire to re-create the atmosphere of ''the epic-making days in Alabama and Mississippi,'' i.e., of the days of King's brave struggle with and partial victory over Southern racism. Women also have a history and also have lives and, I might remind both Mr. Garrow and Mr. Raines (and King posthumously), an equal right to both a personal and social/civil status that sexual users like King deny. The sexual use of women is not a mere peccadillo like, say, one's failure to keep a neat desk, but is a lived expression of an ideology of contempt and misogyny that should not be sanitized or mystified as Mr. Raines has done, but rather should be censured as the sexual bigotry it is - even if, as was the case with King, that ideology and that bigotry found a home within a life that was otherwise devoted to justice and good works.

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"When in doubt, say it was a bad year. Nobody would dare question you. It also means that you don't have to defend yourself. When you cite such self-proclaiming lulus as Prince's ''Under the Cherry Moon'' and Willard Huyck's ''Howard the Duck,'' all can nod in safe agreement that movies are continuing the downhill slide they began sometime before the advent of the talkies. I had no idea of the extent of this alienation until, not long ago, a film scholar said to me, quite seriously, ''I don't think I want to see 'The Birth of a Nation' anymore.'' Yet, in fact, 1986 was an improvement over 1985, in spite of rising production costs that bend the mind. While it was going on, it looked decidely grim. More films were released, for the most part meaning more bad films, everything from ''Mountaintop Motel Massacre'' and ''Girls School Screamers'' to big-budget flops like Alan Alda's ''Sweet Liberty'' and Roman Polanski's ''Pirates.'' If we analyze the year's hit movies as if they are our collective, wish-fulfilling dreams, we are a nation of sentimental sadists and birdbrained yahoos, permanently arrested in our 15th year."

But in 1986, the glory of those success stories was diminished by the gloom of the year's most significant sports story -the death of Len Bias at age 22 from cocaine intoxication. Shortly after dawn on June 19, the 6-foot-8-inch all-America forward collapsed in his University of Maryland dormitory suite. Two days earlier, Bias had been selected by the Boston Celtics with the second choice in the National Basketball Association draft."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"More than 1,200 people, showing both anger and grief at the death of a young black man who was attacked by a group of whites, marched through Howard Beach, Queens, yesterday in a protest against racism. A crowd of white people, who taunted the marchers with calls of ''animals'' and ''go home,'' were kept apart from the demonstration by 250 police officers. The police said there were no arrests or injuries. The marchers, including both black and white people, moved 10 abreast up the wide lanes of Cross Bay Boulevard, stopping for a moment of silent prayer outside the New Park Pizzeria at the corner of 157th Avenue, where what the police say was a racially motivated attack began early Dec. 20. The silence was quickly broken by a shouting match between some demonstrators and white adults and young people who began taunting the marchers."

An official communique published today said that the Minister of Foreign Cooperation, Henry Ruiz Hernandez, returned to Managua this week after a series of meetings with Soviet officials. Mr. Ruiz is a member of the nine-man Sandinista National Directorate and is considered the principal Sandinista link to the Soviet Union."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The business of television was, more than ever, the significant factor concerning what you may or may not have watched in 1986. The commercial networks appeared to have stemmed, at least temporarily, the severe erosion of their audiences. The enormous success of one sitcom, the two-year-old ''Cosby Show,'' continues to prove a boon not only to NBC and its much vaunted ratings victories but also to industry statistics as a whole. As in the theater, a smash hit is good for everybody's business. At the same time, however, faced with new economic realities, most notably a slackening in advertising sales, the networks have been drastically cutting both staff levels and production budgets. There is little joy on Broadcast Row this holiday season. And the corner-cuttings are slowly but surely being reflected in on-screen product."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief, established to make good on Ronald Reagan's promise to ''get the Government off the backs of the people,'' was quietly disbanded in 1983, some said in anticipation of potentially bruising debate in the 1984 elections. This month, it was back in action again with a new mandate: to promote productivity and international competitiveness."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"It may be optimistic, but I hope 1986 will be remembered in architecture as the year in which a few lessons were learned. After all, a lot of big projects changed course this year, and for the better. Most notable, surely, is Television City, the mega-development Donald Trump wants to build on the 76-acre site of the old Pennsylvania Railroad yards on the Upper West Side. The design for Television City by Helmut Jahn that Mr. Trump unveiled with much hoopla last year, an outlandishly simplistic exercise in urban gigantism, has now passed to a well-deserved oblivion and been replaced with a vastly more sophisticated scheme by Alexander Cooper. Whereas the old design looked like a series of rocket ships lined up in bleak open space, the new one attempts to create boulevards, streets and parks that bear some resemblance to real urban places. It is still far, far too big - the overall plan calls for more than 17 million square feet of space - but at least it is a decent and intelligent framework, and if the long process of public review can bring about a reduction in the amount of building that will occur on the site we might actually see a viable project."

Frank C. Carlucci, who will officially take over as White House national security adviser on Friday, has given priority to formulation of an Iran policy, an aide said today. The aide said the policy would deal not only with how the United States should approach Iran, but also with what to do to help free Americans being held hostage in Lebanon by groups close to Iran. 'Looking Ahead to the Future' The plan to tap outside expertise was separate, White House officials said, from the announcement on Friday that David M.

This is nonsense. First, there was no Lebanese investigation in any real sense of the word and no final report was ever issued to the public in any detail, so no wonder it was never ''seriously challenged.'' The bogus casualty figures Mr. Roche cites were leaked by Lebanese officials, who were interested in playing down the number of women and children killed, from what they said was the ''official report.''"

Answer:No one has compiled a comprehensive list of camping sites, according to the Caribbean Tourism Association, which represents most of the islands. Several islands either do not allow camping or do not have any official campgrounds for visitors.

Then you come to the vine-covered mansion and its private chapel, built in 1671, where members of the Guedes family have always lived. It was here, in 1860, that Dom Manuel Pedro Guedes da Silva da Fonseca introduced modern techniques to Portuguese grape growers and laid the foundation of one of the country's principal wine empires. The Quinta da Aveleda Company is the leading exporter of bottled vinho verde, or green wine, a light effervescent wine with low alcoholic content, which is only produced in Portugal. Although it has been producing vinho verde since Roman times, the northwestern corner of Portugal was not officially designated as the vinho verde region until 1908; the designation was internationally recognized in 1973."

Later, friends say, he continued drinking at a private dormitory party in the same college, where he eventually passed out and was taken to his room in Silliman College. The following morning, Mr. McGuire, 19 years old, was found dead in his bed by his roommates. An autopsy by the office of the Chief State Medical Examiner showed Mr. McGuire had died of alcohol poisoning.

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"DONNA MURPHY'S stage career has taken so many unexpected turns, it is no surprise to find her in a musical that is itself full of surprises. The 27-year-old actress, who grew up in Hauppauge, has played three major roles and one minor one in the same show, first as an understudy and finally as a replacement. And now that the show has had an official name change - from ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' to ''Drood,'' to make it appear newer and catchier -it can be said that Ms. Murphy has gone from playing the title role to playing the whole title. When ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood,'' a tricky musical with a multiplicity of possible endings, was first seen at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park during the summer of 1985, Ms. Murphy was a member of the ensemble. She played the small part of Miss Florence Gill, and understudied the roles of Princess Puffer and Helena Landless (the exotic creature with a ''strange, untraceable accent''), then played by, respectively, Cleo Laine and Jana Schneider."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Pop music is a form of entertainment, a medium of expression and a cultural barometer. In 1986, it was all these things and more. Developments such as the Amnesty International benefits, Bruce Springsteen's increasingly evident social consciousness and the rapprochment between black rap and white rock effected by the Run-D.M.C./Aerosmith hit ''Walk This Way'' were evidence that the music can still serve as a kind of conscience for its audience, and perhaps become a catalyst for change. The year in pop began with widespread concern over a growing reaction against suggestive lyrics, especially over the lobbying efforts of the Parents Music Resource Center, which found some lyrics objectionable because of their references to sex or drugs. Many observers feared that if such pressures were successful, socially and politically relevant rock would be the ultimate victim. By year's end, at least some major record labels seemed to be quietly backing away from the kind of monitoring the group had sought. And rock with social and political conscience seemed to be making a comeback."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,I found Robert Gottlieb's logic in ''Politics and Judges Shouldn't Mix'' badly flawed. Mr. Gottlieb argues that the current system of party selection of judges is undemocratic and fails to protect those he calls competent judges who must run for re-election. I would strongly disagree. Party selection of judicial candidates finally allows the electorate a direct say in who their judges will be. The previous practice of cross-party endorsement of the incumbent denied this right to the voters.

But the extent of disagreement about how to fix it was also clear last week as a coalition of national organizations came forward with its approach. Like most proposals already aired, the coalition's ''statement of principles'' emphasized work for welfare recipients. But unlike some plans, notably the Reagan Administration's, the linchpin was the ''primary responsibility'' of the Federal Government for fighting poverty."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"More than any recent year within memory, 1986 was the year of the reissue. And not grandly packaged exhumations of disks long dead, like last year's ''Record of Singing'' Vol. 3 and ''Mapleson Cylinder'' sets. This year, fueled by the burgeoning market in compact disks, the record companies devoted a major portion of their resources to the reissuing of fairly recent analog and digital recordings, along with some classics of the 1930's through the 1960's, on digitally remastered LP's or, ultimately, onto CD's themselves. Thus a survey of the best new recordings of 1986 - albums that appeared in the United States for the first time this year - draws from a slightly smaller pool than in the past, and there are some curious shallow areas. Not many top-of-the-line sets of standard-repertory chamber music were released this year, for instance. And the more marginal forms of contemporary music, the kind put out by labels not yet plugged into CD technology, have become more marginal than ever, as far as the average interested consumer is concerned."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Piece by painstaking piece, NASA is revamping the space shuttle system that disintegrated, along with a good measure of the nation's technological self-confidence, 11 months ago today. The next shuttle orbiter that astronauts clamber into on the Kennedy Space Center launching pad will probably include a crude but effective escape system for them to use in case disaster strikes again. Its landing brakes will be improved. Its main liquid fuel engines will be upgraded, and for the first time astronauts may fly without harboring the seldom-spoken fear that a malfunction in a simple 17-inch valve could choke off the craft's liquid fuel supply and send it crashing into the sea. Much Safer Craft Is Seen The safety changes being made by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration thus go far beyond the redesigning of the solid-fuel booster rocket whose failure killed seven astronauts 73 seconds into the flight of the Challenger last Jan. 28. While the debate over how to redesign those boosters has drawn much attention, both agency officials and outside experts are concerned that other critical elements of the shuttle may have been neglected amid the pressures to keep flying that contributed to the Challenger's destruction."

THE great battles in the Old Testament that took place in the mountainous har megiddo supplied a label for the scene prophesied in Revelations of Armageddon, the ultimate battle between good and evil at the world's end. W. Bruce Lincoln, a professor of Russian history at Northern Illinois University, has adapted the concept to his seventh book on Russian history, a sequel to his 1983 survey ''In War's Dark Shadow'' and an extension of his earlier studies, ''The Romanovs'' and ''In the Vanguard of Reform.'' ''Passage Through Armageddon: The Russians in War and Revolution 1914-1918'' carries the lively story of the fall of the autocracy and the explosion of the Revolution up through peace with the Central Powers in World War I, the Czar's execution and the beginnings of the civil war."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"''YES,'' SAID President Reagan affirmatively, in defense of his stewardship of foreign policy, ''it is in our interest to stand with those who would take arms against the sea of darkness.'' That was a play on a Shakespearean phrase that is often misunderstood. Hamlet, contemplating self-destruction in his ''To be, or not to be'' soliloquy, asks, ''Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer/ The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,/ Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,/ And by opposing end them?'' A sea of troubles was, in Shakespeare's day, a way of characterizing this weary life: it did not mean a whole bunch of difficulties as much as it stood for life itself. Just as an optimist in the 1930's would think of life as a bowl of cherries, a pessimist in Elizabethan times would call it a sea of troubles."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The Pentagon doesn't really want it, the White House may be playing games with it, and the new weapon will cost billions that the deficit doom-shouters will be reluctant to put up. Nevertheless, President Reagan's decision to seek production of the mobile Midgetman missile may prove to be his most important contribution to national security. If Mr. Reagan is serious about the Midgetman, he deserves real credit - given the sea of adversity in which he now struggles - for taking this first step toward a smaller, more survivable, less threatening nuclear deterrent. The decision appears also to have signaled that this President will not again ask for more than the 50 MX missiles already approved."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"It was almost a tie for New York City's housing shortage last week: Mayor Koch announced plans to renovate nearly 5,200 apartments in abandoned city-owned buildings, and a State Supreme Court judge issued a ruling that could reduce the potential number of single-occupancy hotel rooms by as many as 10,000. The renovations would be undertaken in Manhattan, the Bronx and Brooklyn by private developers, nonprofit community groups and contractors hired by the city."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"THE MOTHER OF DREAMS And Other Short Stories: Portrayals of Women in Modern Japanese Fiction. Edited by Makoto Ueda. 279 pp. New York: Kodansha International. $19.95. MAKOTO UEDA, the editor of this noteworthy anthology of modern Japanese short stories, has divided the book into five sections: the Maiden, the Wife, the Mistress, the Mother and the Working Woman. It is an indication that the influence of roles, even with the changes in postwar Japan, is still felt. The authors are all established -among them, the 1968 Nobel laureate Yasunari Kawabata and other popular writers such as Kobo Abe, Kafu Nagai and Fumiko Enchi - and include an almost equal number of men and women writers. (Readers be warned that the table of contents lists the authors in the traditional Japanese order, with surnames first.) The surface of these stories, mostly written since World War II, is often deceptively placid. The writing is spare. Because the stories have various translators -all, in fact, students of Mr. Ueda (who teaches at Stanford University) - it is hard to measure how much of the voice and style of a story is the author's own. Some are smoother than others. Still, throughout the placid prose there is strong emotion. In ''A Woman to Call Mother'' by Taiko Hirabayashi, a daughter's failure to visit her dying mother is ''an indication that their emotions were too strong.'' By refraining from frenzied description, the writer renders the drama in a story all the more powerfully."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Sports Editor: Phil Hochberg's column on the Giants-Redskins rivalry (''Sweet Memories of a Bitter Rivalry,'' The New York Times, Dec. 7) shows what poor sports the Redskins and their fans are. If his fondest memory of the Giants-Redskins rivalry is the Redskins' kicking a field goal with time running out in a game in which they already led by 28 points, he should be re-examining his values.

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"IT was a splendid Christmas present - perfect in its timing, perfect in its fulfillment of national longings - the sight of the frail aircraft known as the Voyager settling awkwardly to earth in California last Tuesday after a nine-day circumnavigation of the globe, an epic journey that bore the stamp of Lindbergh and Magellan. In a season of optimism thwarted, of pervasive dissatisfaction and uncertainty, the flight of the Voyager seemed all the more remarkable. A President in whom a whole nation had invested so much hope and who had seemed to repay that hope with a restoration of public purpose and pride, found himself embattled, his Administration all but paralyzed, by a controversial policy made worse by the uses to which it was put. At the same time, the two other great powers in the world found their authority challenged - the Soviets by riots in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan against the imposition of authority by the far-off ethnic Russians, the Chinese by demonstrations in Shanghai and Beijing itself against the slow progress in implementing reform."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: A Dec. 9 item reports that New York City's Transit Authority has come up with a ''crowding index'' to quantify the subway rider's experience. As you note, the T.A. assumes that standees take up 2.36 square feet of floor space. That number was obtained by assuming that riders were ellipses with axes of 2 feet and 1.5 feet. The T.A. then measured the available standing room of each car type and divided by 2.36 square feet, supposedly yielding ''the number of standees each car type can hold when crowding begins to be intolerable.''"

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"WHEN he upset Kenneth A. Gibson last spring to become the chief elected official of New Jersey's largest city, Sharpe James recalled recently, ''I knew it would be the worst and the best of times to become Mayor.'' On one hand, there has been a resurgence of development interest in Newark. Last week, announcing that they would purchase and rehabilitate the Prudential Insurance Company's 60-year-old Gibraltar Building, officials of Time Equities, a real estate concern, referred to Newark as ''well along the road to a vigorous recovery.'' But even while Mayor James hailed the project as one with the potential to create thousands of jobs, a less happy matter involving employment in Newark awaited resolution. In preparation for reducing its payroll by as many as 100 early next year, City Hall sent layoff notices this month to virtually all of the 4,500 people it employs."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: For me, Don Wycliff's ''How Many Larry Davises?'' (The Editorial Notebook, Dec. 13) served only as a symbol of sociological myopia. Mr. Wycliff's statement, ''The need to do something about such young men is a concern now,'' demonstrates the view of the after-the-fact crowd that readily expresses dismay and frustration at seemingly unpreventable criminal acts. Much of my difficulty in understanding Mr. Wycliff's view - that military service and the Job Corps are acceptable solutions for young black men who behave as their own worst enemies - was that on one hand he looks at these young black men as victims of broken families, and on the other, he implies they are psychological powderkegs waiting to explode. In my view, neither military service nor the Job Corps is an effective solution to a continuing social problem."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"As in any theatrical event, many of the key players in American business during 1986 operated from behind the scenes. They received little notice although their work this year produced stunning revelations on Wall Street and generated millions of dollars worth of new products. For the most part, 1986 was a year in which Americans were swept up by national pride, a spirit generated by the celebration of the Statue of Liberty's centennial. People were eager to buy just about anything that smacked of Americana - from a $40 photo essay of the nation, which becamse the hottest Christmas seller in the bookstores, to a $400 gold coin newly issued by the United States Mint. The health binge this year put the spotlight on calcium, which turned up in the most unlikely places: orange juice, for example. And despite the drop in the dollar and the burst of patroitism, Americans purchased imports in greater volume than ever beofre in '86. That generated a big payoff for one South Korean automaker who dared to bring a new car into the oversupplied American market. The following is a glimpse of some of the year's unsung heroes: The Packagers Who Finally Scored A Publishing Coup RICHARD S. SMOLAND and David E. Cohen do not dress for success. The 37-year-old Mr. Smolan, known as Rick, sports granny glasses, a mustache, and a shoulder-length mane of brown hair.

First, work within the apartment such as plumbing violates the tenants' ''quiet and peaceful'' enjoyment of their living space. Not only must tenants deal with the opening of walls to expose the pipes, but they also have to live with it for weeks or months. Windows, while perhaps not taking as long, are equally a bother. Occupants may even have to take time off from work, losing wages, to oversee personal property."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Three recent recordings of Bach's choral music, each differing in interpretation, show how different approaches can all be valid. Of primary interest because of the magnitude of the work is John Eliot Gardiner's version of the Mass in B minor (Archiv CD 415514 AH2, two disks). The English conductor, who has made quite a reputation in the field of Baroque music, leads the Monteverdi Choir and the English Baroque Soloists. The singers number 30 (women sopranos, the rest men), and the many soloists are drawn from that group. Their names will not be familiar to most American listeners, but they are equal to the demands made on them. The instrumental ensemble of 38 uses period instruments. All of this, of course, is in the current vogue for correct Baroque style and sounds fine. The question remains whether the conductor can bring the music to life in these terms - too many musicians assume that if you have the right forces the music will take care of itself. Mr. Gardiner begins the Mass disappointingly. He has chosen a tempo for the Kyrie that is meaningless, being neither slow nor fast enough to suggest any emotional impulse. From then on, however, the performance becomes assertive and generates interest."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"LENDERS have long been aware that their more affluent customers frequently need the sort of services that may not not be part of standard banking fare. This is certainly true of home purchase. The normal mortgage application procedure, for example, may not be appropriate for certain self-employed people. Perhaps the profitability of their business or profession, as reflected on their tax returns, does not accurately reflect their ability to carry a loan. Others may have a stronger capital position but a small income and are willing to make a down payment of 40 percent or even 50 percent for the right to borrow more than is normally permitted."

That the center, founded in 1966 by four civil rights lawyers and activists, is around to observe its 20th birthday is ''the miracle of the age,'' said William M. Kunstler, one of the founders along with Arthur Kinoy, Morton Stavis and Benjamin E. Smith, who died in 1976. ''I never thought we would be together for 20 years,'' Mr. Kunstler said.

In 1859, the Governor's office was an Italianate splendor, newly rebuilt after a fire, said Jay White, an architect in Waitsfield, Vt., who coordinated the renovation project. But over the years, the office was redone several times.

And he seems to have his share of interested young women - many of whom he meets when they come backstage at the Broadhurst Theater, where he is starring in ''Broadway Bound'' - to tell him how good he is. He is playing Eugene Morris Jerome at the age of 23, as the Simon character begins his writing career. ''It's great for my social life,'' Mr. Silverman said with an unabashed grin.

With nearly every aspect of electronic communications currently being converted to digital techniques, it is not surprising that the trend is reaching home video.

It was the most recent sign of bitterness among residents who believe that as Portland basks in the glitter of an economic and cultural renaissance, the problems of the 20 to 30 percent of the population who the city says live at or under the Federal poverty level have been brushed aside. While the story of gentrification and displacement is repeated across the country, some civic leaders say the contrast is sharper here because the city has recently been well publicized as a mecca for affluent young professionals."

The appearance is deceptive: Spruce Bank Farm is a low-rent housing project for the aged, which only a decade ago would have been unacceptable to a residential community that prided itself on its dignified, affluent image. The project, completed last summer at a cost of $1.25 million, offers one-bedroom units for as little as $282 a month - about a third of the market rate for a rental in that area if such an apartment can be found. Not surprisingly, more than 100 people rushed to sign up for the 24 homes, despite strict income and age limitations."

Whatever has given anyone the impression that Brooklynites would support a minor league team, especially with two successful major league teams that enjoy support throughout the borough? Do we need to be reminded of the ill-fated Brooklyn Dodgers professional football team of the now defunct Continental Football League of the late 1960's? This team, despite the glamour of Jackie Robinson as general manager, played to empty seats while Brooklyn football fans continued to flock to see the Giants and the Jets. That's hardly an encouraging precedent."

Especially those on Monomoy Island, where more than 20,000 nesting pairs of great black-backed and herring gulls are forcing off smaller and more timid species of shore birds, like the rare piping plovers, laughing gulls, Arctic and least terns, as well as the endangered roseate terns. In 1963, when Monomoy Island became this area's largest Federal Wildlife Refuge, there were only five nesting pairs of gulls on the island, a 2,750-acre sand strip that begins about half a mile south of Chatham."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"ROCK OF AGES The Rolling Stone History of Rock & Roll. By Ed Ward, Geoffrey Stokes and Ken Tucker. Illustrated. 649 pp. New York: Rolling Stone Press/Summit Books. Cloth, $24.95. Paper, $14.95. WE never did outgrow it, this hopped-up musical hybrid, this raucous noise that ultimately made all of popular culture march to its beat. When rock first began to shake, rattle and roll its way across the American consciousness, we children of the 1950's were told that it was at best a freakish fad - the musical equivalent of the Hula-Hoop or Davy Crockett's coonskin cap. At worst, it was the sound of the civilized social fabric unraveling. By the end of that decade, there were signs that this rude, frenzied musical aberration had spent its energy. When the Beatles gave rock-and-roll a much-needed jolt, the moptops were generally regarded as a sociological phenomenon of a particularly silly season. We would soon leave this awkward age behind, we were assured. We would outgrow rock and adolescence together, and if we listened to music at all it would be good music, adult music. Guy Lombardo. Jerry Vale. Broadway show tunes. We would reflect on that loud, crazy music of old and laugh at the follies of youth."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In his review (Nov. 23) of William Wright's ''Lillian Hellman,'' Frank Rich reports that one of the issues Wright is unable to resolve definitively is whether Miss Hellman ever joined the Communist Party. I cannot answer the question with absolute finality either, but I can refute the main item cited by Mr. Wright on the affirmative side: the testimony of Martin Berkeley before the House Committee on Un-American Activities that she ''was one of the group that met at his house in Hollywood in June of 1937 to organize a Hollywood branch of the Communist Party.''"

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Many articles have been printed about replacing the system of electing state judges with the system of appointing judges by an executive, usually the governor [ ''Politics and Judges Shouldn't Mix,'' Opinion Page, Dec. 7 ] . No evidence is ever presented that this would result in better judges; the people would simply lose the vote for a questionable and unprovable benefit. There is simply no proof that appointed judges are better qualified than elected judges, or that appointed judges are less susceptible to influence than elected judges. We need merely recall a Federal judge's actions in a famous Chicago Vietnam-era case or President Nixon's visit to a Federal judge in a Pennsylvania case to belie these assertions of reform."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"IN a pro football game, a team normally has 60 to 70 plays on offense, 60 to 70 on defense and 20 to 25 in kicking situations. Over a 16-game regular season, that works out to 2,240 to 2,640 plays. Of all those plays in the Giants' glorious 14-2 season, one stood out above the rest. Years from now, it will be remembered simply as fourth and 17. It occurred on Nov. 16 in the noisy Metrodome in Minneapolis. With 72 seconds left and the Giants on their 48-yard line and trailing the Minnesota Vikings, 20-19, the Giants faced fourth down and 17 yards to go for a first down. Phil Simms then passed 22 yards to Bobby Johnson to keep the Giants alive, and with 12 seconds left Raul Allegre kicked a 33-yard field goal that won the game for the Giants, 22-20."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"THE MEDICAL IMPLICATIONS OF NUCLEAR WAR Institute of Medicine/ National Academy of Sciences. Edited by Fredric Solomon and Robert Q. Marston. Foreword by Lewis Thomas. 619 pp. Washington: National Academy Press. Cloth, $43.50. Paper, $33.50. THE title of this collection of papers, ''The Medical Implications of Nuclear War,'' suggests a discussion cast in narrow clinical terms. In fact, the volume offers a comprehensive survey of the consequences of a major nuclear exchange, ranging from the carnage caused by blast, fire and radiation to long-term effects on the environment and on human society. This marshaling of the work of experts in many scientific fields creates a harrowing prospect, a kind of multidisciplinary vision of doomsday. On scientific grounds, the work shares the weaknesses, as well as the strengths, of such assessments. The reliability of the source is not in question; the volume is based on a symposium organized by the ultraresponsible National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine. The catch is that credibility in science depends on verifiability. Until a nuclear war occurs, the results remain hypothetical. And who would want the hypothesis tested?"

Except for the paperboy and a few stubborn relatives, my social and professional acquaintances have adjusted easily to my decision. While introductions are longer than they might otherwise be, there have been no real disadvantages. But now some of these friends who have kept their names are having children, and others of us are talking about having them, and the question of the child's surname arises."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has ruled out using unmanned rockets to ferry space station components into orbit during the early stages of the project, even though such expendable rockets could speed up construction. A study conducted by John Dunning, a space station manager at NASA's Lewis Research Center at Cleveland, found that use of new expendable rockets, along with the shuttle, could accelerate assembly by up to nine months, rather than using the space shuttle alone to take components into orbit. But Mr. Dunning said the schedule advantage provided by unmanned rockets was offset by a 10 percent to 40 percent increase in potentially dangerous space walks by astronauts required in the first four shuttle construction flights to assemble the components."

When the group lost its $37,000-a-year consulant's contract with the city last fall, it had to lay off a social worker, reduce the salaries of the organization's other five employees and discontinue a neighborhood newsletter."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: While I would not dispute that Robert Skidelsky's ''John Maynard Keynes. Volume One: Hopes Betrayed 1883-1920'' was one of the best books of 1986, as you state in your Dec. 7 issue, I do not think it is correct to say, ''This is the first biography of the economist to bring together the two sides of his early life - the formidable public person he was by the age of 30 and the circus rider of the social and homosexual whirl of Bloomsbury.'' I believe it can be demonstrated that I did that in a book published in the United States in April 1984 by Macmillan (Charles H. Hession, ''John Maynard Keynes: A Personal Biography of the Man Who Revolutionized Capitalism and Changed the Way We Live'') and reviewed by Peter Stansky in The Book Review on May 20 of that year..CHARLES H.

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Most conductors are so involved with orchestral sounds and balances that when they write for orchestra (either as composers, like Wagner, Strauss, or, in our time, Leonard Bernstein, or simply as arrangers, like the late Leopold Stokowski) they tend to do so brilliantly. Two highly enjoyable recent releases exemplify each of the categories: one devoted to nine of Stokowski's arrangements (Telarc CD-80129, also on LP), the other devoted to theater music by Mr. Bernstein (EMI/Angel CDC-7 47522 2, also cassette and LP). Mr.Stokowski was noted for his orchestrations of organ works by Bach, in which he managed an uncanny preservation of organ sonorities in orchestral garb. Telarc's disk includes two of them, the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor and the ''Little Fugue'' in G Minor, along with an intriguingly successful orchestral translation of the slow movement from Beethoven's ''Moonlight'' Sonata. It also includes two arrangements Stokowski made in direct competition with famous pre-existing ones: Albeniz's ''Festival Day in Seville,'' in a more imaginative setting than the familiar Arbos version, and Mussorgsky's ''Night on Bald Mountain,'' which seems to differ for the sake of difference from Rimsky-Korsakov's more convincing orchestration of the same work. There are also some shorter transcriptions of music by Boccherini, Debussy and Rachmaninoff. Erich Kunzel leads the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra in strong performances, and Telarc's recording is superb."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"After hailing Andrei Sakharov's return to Moscow after seven cruel years of banishment in the closed city of Gorky, hail the sequel: his welcome at the Physics Institute and the Soviet Government's calm response to his public criticism of the Soviet assault on Afghanistan - the very ''crime'' that led to his banishment under Leonid Brezhnev.

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"SEVERAL years ago Notre Dame and Pittsburgh both had potentially good teams, but did not play each other that season. We are both independents, and I remember kidding with the Fiesta Bowl people, telling them that if my school, Notre Dame, and Pittsburgh both wound up undefeated we could go to their bowl and play for the national championship. And I said, ''I bet you'd get enough money to make it worthwhile.'' It didn't happen that year, but the idea was not long in arriving. More people seem to be talking about the college football bowl games this year than at any other time in recent memory, and most of the discussion has been caused by the fact that Miami and Penn State, two independents, will be playing in the Fiesta Bowl Friday night for a clear-cut national title. Already there has been an incredible amount written and said about the matchup, the money involved, the moving of the bowl date and the possible use of overtime, which was considered, then ruled out. And I feel all the attention is great for college football."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Americana - from ancient pueblo pottery to 20th-century modern - dominated in exhibitions of decorative arts at museums and galleries and in what collectors pursued throughout 1986. The wealth of materials that were exhibited and auctioned this year cover the vast range of styles and categories of works produced on this continent over more than 1,000 years. What historians, curators and collectors share in tracking these objects is an intense curiosity about this nation's past - as seen in ancient artifacts, folk art fantasies, the furnishings of Victorian mansions, Bakelite radios and pop-up toasters. The Metropolitan Museum of Art presented some of the oldest and most lavish examples of such works in two dramatically different exhibitions. The boldly graphic pottery crafted between 550 and 1150 in what is now New Mexico was presented in ''Mimbres Pottery: Ancient Art of the American Southwest.'' These haunting works are among the most expressive of painterly ceramics from the ancient world. The wit, mysticism and sophistication of the pueblo-dwelling people we call Mimbres (named after a local tree) was captured by gifted potters in ritual vessels - bowls, platters and jars -works that are among the most important documents of a society that vanished about 800 years ago."

The main group of insurgents, recently allied with Libya, turned against its northern neighbor after Goukouni Oueddei, the rebels' leader and former President of Chad, was arrested in Tripoli Oct. 30.

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The early tidings announced that the British were coming. And so they did - along with the French, the Chinese, the Spaniards, the Canadians and many more. It was the year of the foreign invasion in dance. The impact of visiting companies was the strongest in a decade - both in numbers and the quality they demonstrated. Nonetheless, it was Lar Lubovitch, an American, who shot to the front ranks of choreographers in 1986. Very clearly on a creative jag after several years spent in a minimalist rut, Mr. Lubovitch offered a modern-dance premiere, ''Concerto Six Twenty-Two,'' that heralded a flamboyant inventiveness. Along with his recent ''Brahms Symphony,'' this ingenious work to Mozart delivered a cornucopia of glorious dancing. The year, however, did not bring out the most inspired new work on much of the home front, especially in the ballet companies. That the Americans were doing business as usual is a factor to consider in determining the extent of the foreign visitors' impact."

When the Detroit Institute of Arts wanted to mount an exhibition of American art from 1876-1883, it hired the Leone Design Group of Larchmont to do the work. Both design groups moved from the city to the suburbs when they needed more space, but, equally important, say the principals in each company, has been the gain in productive working hours. ''When we have to, we work around the clock against deadlines,'' said Barry Howard, founder and president of BHA.

WITH the publication in English of his study of Anton Chekhov, the Russian-born Henri Troyat has once again demonstrated that he is an excellent biographer. Whether his subject is one of Russia's despotic rulers, like Ivan the Terrible or Catherine the Great, or one of its complicated writers, such as Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Gogol or Tolstoy, Mr. Troyat has a storyteller's skill for dealing with real-life characters. Their intimate worlds, their defeats, pains and triumphs, become the reader's. Mr. Troyat refrains from cluttering his biographies with mountains of details; instead, he selects only those events - large and small - that contribute to the whole picture. The academically inclined might like to know more about an event or person, but Mr. Troyat refuses to comply if he feels it would impede the dramatic flow of his story. Unobtrusive and seductive, his biographies read like novels. And that's no small achievement."

One of the writers present, an essayist and medical administrator, argued for the objective truth of the sciences and the overwhelming role of opinion in literature and literary criticism. Another, a much-published science writer, argued that science writing is always about the unknown, its discourse an eternal questioning. But, I said, isn't the subject of all writing the unknown? Absolutely not, the science writer retorted. Remember what we tell students in creative writing courses: ''Write about what you know.''"

Enacted in response to criticism that black and Hispanic youths were underrepresented in the city's university system, the new law provided the money needed to open the doors of its prestigious four-year colleges to ''educationally and economically'' disadvantaged students who otherwise would have been ineligible for admission. Begun in September 1966 with fewer than 1,500 students, the program offered remedial instruction in basic skills, counseling and stipends for books and other expenses. It immediately caused an ideological split in the university. Proponents argued that the program - called SEEK, for Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge - was fulfilling the traditional role of the university to educate the city's poor.

Sakharov, the dissident Soviet physicist, had cautious words of praise last week for the man who sprung him. Dr. Sakharov said he had ''great respect'' for Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has lately encouraged a more open society and who ordered Dr. Sakharov's release to underscore that policy. The physicist said that when Mr. Gorbachev telephoned to inform him of his release, he encouraged the Soviet leader to free other political and religious dissenters."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"DEBORAH RAIZES hesitates to describe herself as a ''housewife.'' Not that the vivacious mother of two isn't proud of her home and family, but the term doesn't quite convey the reality of her daily life. Unlike many women of her generation - Mrs. Raizes is a Scarsdale resident in her late 30's - she does not work at a paid job. She does work, however, often for up to eight hours a day, in volunteer positions with at least nine organizations in the community. Mary Beth Buck also lives in Scarsdale and has four children in the public schools. She often works 40 hours a week - including time on weekends and in the evenings - on volunteer projects she has undertaken for four community organizations. Although the two women have never met, they share a common outlook. Volunteer work, they say, gives them more intellectual stimulation and satisfaction - as well as freedom - than they can imagine ever getting from regular paid employment."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Most visitors to this city think of the Alamo as a tiny shrine where brave Texans died fighting for liberty. Mayor Henry Cisneros wants them to think of a domed sports stadium. Despite Texas' economic woes and a deficit of $26.9 million in San Antonio's budget for this fiscal year, Mr. Cisneros wants the state's oldest city to spend up to $200 million building a modern, all-purpose stadium, to be called the Alamo Dome. Mr. Cisneros's ambitious vision says something about San Antonio's aspirations as well as the city's inferiority complex. In 1920, San Antonio was the most populous city in Texas. A decade later it was a distant third behind Houston and Dallas, were it has remained."

Mankiller, the daughter of a full-blooded Cherokee father and a white mother, as Chief. She became the first woman to lead a large Indian tribe in the United States. The Oklahoma Cherokees - 72,000 today - were forced by the Federal Government to move in the winter of 1838-39 from Georgia to Oklahoma along a trail on which thousands died of disease and exposure. They maintain cultural ties with the Cherokees of North Carolina, whose ancestors fled the forced march."

1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The United States is pressing ahead with plans to construct two new large radars in Greenland and Britain, according to officials, despite a renewed proposal from the Soviet Union and the opinion of some arms-control experts that building the radars would violate the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. The Soviet Union repeated an offer this fall to decommission an advanced radar being completed at Abalakovo, near Krasnoyarsk in central Siberia, if the United States would agree to mothball its radar being built in Greenland and abandon plans to build a new radar in Britain. The American effort to build the radars has led to a sharp debate among policy makers and arms control experts outside of Government as to whether the United States is violating the 1972 ABM Treaty, as the Russians contend. Some experts say the treaty does not allow the United States to build the new radars. A classified Government assessment prepared during the treaty negotiations also suggests that the construction of these radars is not permitted under the treaty, which restricts the testing and deployment of missile defense systems."

I'm unable to understand, however, why he allowed key parts of his eighth and ninth paragraphs to appear as his own observations when the points he makes on William H. Pritchard, Richard Poirier and Frost's ''idea of poetry'' are so very clearly given on pages 285, 248 and 119 (without excisions), respectively."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"To designate with confidence a handful of musical events out of the hundreds or thousands that filtered through one's ears during this year is both easy and impossible. Easy, because a couple of eagerly awaited major happenings lived up to advance billing and thus became lock-tight certainties to find a place in musical history. The appearance of Joan Sutherland in the Metropolitan's ''Puritani'' will go down in music's annals, I feel sure, as will the architectural facelift that brightened the face and sound of Carnegie Hall. At age 60, of course, Miss Sutherland did not sing with quite the creamy tone and airy abandon above high C that first brought her into the international spotlight. But this ''Puritani,'' coming 25 years after her Metropolitan debut, left one persuaded that opera historians will single her voice out as one of the technical marvels of a voice-poor era. In terms of durability and voice preservation into advanced age - and probably in artistry as well -Miss Sutherland compares favorably with another soprano immortal, her Australian forerunner Nellie Melba. If an important musical happening of 1986 is defined as one likely to be remembered in the next century, Joan Sutherland singing Elvira with bel canto brilliance in her 60th year cannot be overlooked."
1986-12-28T00:00:00Z,"SOON after the Iran affair erupted, Israeli officials rushed to emphasize that it would have no negative effect on bilateral relations with the United States. A troop of visiting Congressmen passing through Jerusalem during the holiday season repeated the message that all is well between Jerusalem and Washington. In fact, this assessment seems to be at best premature and at worst wrong. No one knows this better than Israeli officials themselves. There is a good deal of quiet anxiety here over what Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North will say about Israel if he testifies on the inside story of the Iran affair. Israeli officials are confident that, regarding the first phase of the operation, before January 1986, they have little to worry about save the possibility that private Israeli arms dealers somehow profited from the arrangments."

The chase ended when the van slammed into a police roadblock on Route 17 in East Rutherford. One of the bullets struck the right front tire of a North Bergen patrol car, but did not strike any officers or motorists on heavily traveled local streets and major highways of Hudson and Bergen Counties. ''With all the shots being fired, thank God nobody was hurt,'' Deputy Chief William Sybel of the North Bergen Police Department said. The pursuing officers did not return fire, he said."

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"QUESTION: One way of measuring a baseball player's production on offense for a season is to add his total runs scored and total runs batted in, then subtract his home-run total, since a homer counts as both a run scored and one driven in. Under that condition, would Jose Canseco of the Oakland A's still warrant being voted American League rookie of the year over Wally Joyner of the California Angels? It reinforces the selection. With 85 runs scored, 117 batted in and 33 home runs, Canseco had a total run production of 169 (202 minus 33). Joyner was 9 behind with 160, based on 82 runs scored, 100 driven home and 22 homers. The major league leader was Don Mattingly of the Yankees with a 199 total fashioned from 117 runs scored, 113 r.b.i. and 31 homers. QUESTION: Down by one run, two outs from defeat and runners on first and third, Team A pulls a surprise bunt play in an effort to accomplish two things: fetch the tying run in from third and advance the potential winning run into scoring position at second base. After the batter bunts the ball, though, the Team B pitcher makes a surprising catch, then turns and throws to third in an attempt to double the runner off that base and end the game. As the runner dives back into the base, the ball hits him and rolls toward left field and the runner winds up going home."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Aside effect of the phenomenal increase in the value of duck, goose and shorebird decoys over the past decade has been the spate of books devoted to the craft or art of creating them. None of these books suggests that anyone clever with his hands is going to make a living at decoy carving; for most, the rewards will not be financial. There are two categories of waterfowl decoys, working and decorative, and most who begin carving the first-named do so because they want to use them for hunting. The decorative birds, often in miniature and highly detailed, are intended to please the eye rather than to lure ducks and geese within range on some storm-tossed bay."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Thousands of New Yorkers, living in a city where usable public bathrooms are few and far between, were fined $50 to $250 this year for using streets, sidewalks and subway stations as urinals. Many of the summonses, city officials say, went to cabdrivers in a rush. Some other offenders were homeless people. Others, they say, were too lazy, too rude or too drunk to search for a restroom. Almost all were men. And all of them are part of a problem - public urination - that was addressed in the first century by the Roman Empire, lessened in the 20th century by several European cities, but today in New York City remains perplexing and unpleasant."

Hoping to forge strength out of weakness and, above all, profits out of losses, the two giant corporations announced plans in November to pool their resources and merge their subsidiaries in South America's two leading economies in what some industry analysts have described as a creative attempt to remain in business. Owned 51 percent by Volkswagen and 49 percent by Ford, the new company will be known as Autolatina, potentially the world's 11th-largest car manufacturer, with a productive capacity of 900,000 vehicles a year, and a market share of 61 percent in Brazil and 34 percent in Argentina.

During World War II, when queried about the point from which American planes left for the first bombing raid on Tokyo, President Roosevelt smilingly replied, ''Shangri-La,'' thus ensuring the story's niche in history.

The largest spectator fleet of the trials - more than 50 boats -jammed the finish line as the two 12-Meters approached. It wasn't clear who would win until Stars & Stripes tacked one last time and dashed across the line to victory to the cheers of the waterborne crowd.

The film, planned to commemorate the 1987 Year of Shelter for the Homeless, would have featured projects from Brazil and Sri Lanka along with two groups working in New York, the Urban Homesteaders Assistance Board and Habitat for Humanity. Film officials said they did not realize the United States Mission would object to the inclusion of the New York projects because of the nature of the organizations involved. Urban Homesteaders is financed largely with contributions from the philanthropist Leonard Stern and is training more than 12,000 people to manage the city-owned tenements in which they live, for future purchase. Habitat for Humanity, through which people are rebuilding vacant buildings on the Lower East Side, is closely associated with former President Jimmy Carter."

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Mayor Koch went to a church in Howard Beach, Queens, yesterday in search of what he called an honest and forthright discussion about race relations and found himself interrupted, booed, shouted down and snubbed. Some refused to enter the church because Mr. Koch was there. Others walked out as he stood before them in Our Lady of Grace Roman Catholic Church on 159th Avenue, a short walk from where a 23-year-old black man, Michael Griffith, lost his life nine days ago in a racial attack by a group of white men. Shouts of ''Go home,'' ''Resign'' and ''You have no right here,'' greeted the Mayor's arrival. Members of the congregation treated his visit and departure just as angrily - in contrast with the friendly reception he got later yesterday at another Queens church. That was the Morning Star Missionary Baptist Church in the predominantly black community of St. Albans."

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Security forces are on high alert at Leonardo da Vinci Airport and other potential terrorist targets around Rome, Government officials said today. The added precautions were in part a response to recent terrorist threats against Italy, the officials said. Police officers armed with submachine guns were out in large numbers at the entrance to the airport's international terminal today, and travelers were randomly challenged to produce tickets and passports before they were allowed to enter. Helicopters swept low over the airport, which is also known as Fiumicino, and police vehicles patrolled the utility roads near the runways. The security measures were stepped up at the beginning of the Christmas holidays and were further increased after the crash of an Iraqi Airways plane in Saudi Arabia during a hijacking attempt on Thursday, officials said."

''So many things have gone wrong for Hafez al-Assad in the last six months,'' a senior Western diplomat here said. ''There's just a huge, long list of problems. He's in trouble.'' Chief among Mr. Assad's problems is the unraveling of his effort to impose his will on the chaos of Lebanon, where a Syrian-brokered pact, signed with considerable ceremony here a year ago, broke down, and where Mr. Assad's enemy Yasir Arafat is rebuilding the Palestine Liberation Organization bases he lost in the 1982 Israeli invasion."

The debut artist was Faith Esham, familiar from her many roles at the City Opera, as Marzelline. The role proved to suit her voice better than it did her style as an actress. She projects knowing artfulness and sophistication more readily than innocent sincerity, and Marzelline depends on the latter. Here, Miss Esham played girlish high spirits and petulance with such insistence that even before the first number was over one felt she had protested too much."

Money, the lifeblood of the takeover game, remains cheap, making it easier for corporate raiders like Carl C. Icahn, Ronald O. Perelman and Asher B.

If all goes well, Mr. Quintero, a director who has staged many productions of Eugene O'Neill plays, will direct a production of O'Neill's bitingly satirical ''Marco Millions.'' Mr. Sha and Mr. Quintero had a meeting in mid-December at the director's home in California and reached a tentative agreement on the joint effort. The will is there on both sides, Mr. Sha said before he left for home on Dec. 18, but the question, as is often the case, is money. Mr. Sha estimated that about $30,000 would be required to get the American director and an aide to China. While the Chinese Government may be able to pay part of this, private and governmental help is being sought in the United States."

Avraham Shalom, former head of the internal security service, Shin Beth, had hinted that Mr. Shamir was implicated in the killings and a cover-up. Mr. Shalom asserted in a request for amnesty that all his actions in the affair ''were done with permission and authority in order to preserve the security of the state and prevent the disclosure of its most guarded secrets.'' Most of Mr. Shalom's actions in the affair were carried out while Mr. Shamir was Prime Minister in 1984. As such, Mr. Shamir was Mr. Shalom's direct and only superior."

Other meetings with Israeli officials will depend on Cardinal O'Connor's willingness to see them officially. Vatican Position The Vatican has given de facto recognition to Israel as a nation, though not full diplomatic relations, and the Apostolic Delegate has held meetings at the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Religious Affairs.

''We didn't want a traditional wedding,'' said Mr. Moschenross, a 32-year-old general manager of a fabric store chain in Vancouver, British Columbia. In an era in which jetliners have become the subways of the skies, the Moschenrosses joined the growing ranks of air travelers yearning to put the fancy back into flight by riding the Concorde, the needle-thin, droopy-nosed, supersonic plane. Price Break on Charters The chariot of corporate executives and the super-rich - regular one-way trans-Atlantic fares now cost more than $2,100 - the Concorde has now been put within the reach of many erstwhile armchair travelers, thanks to an array of cheaper charter flights offered through Air France and British Airways, operators of the planes."

Goldin asserts (''The Divestiture Con Game,'' Op-Ed, Dec. 16) that recent divestment announcements by I.B.M. and others is nothing more than a ''con game'' to permit circumvention of economic sanctions on South Africa. This misinforms your readers about I.B.M.'s motives for selling our South African subsidiary and the conditions under which our products will be sold there."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d has rejected a request from an independent counsel to widen her investigation of whether a senior Justice Department official acted improperly in withholding documents from Congress, according to sources familiar with the investigation. The sources said that Alexia J. Morrison, the independent counsel investigating Theodore B.

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Law-enforcement experts say 1987 will be a watershed year for the city's five Mafia families. The experts, who monitor organized-crime activities, say that for the first time since the families were formed in 1931 the leadership of each will change all at once. The upheaval is the result of a campaign by Federal and local authorities that has led to convictions or indictments of those identified as the heads of each family and many of their top lieutenants. With these figures facing long sentences - in Federal prisons far from their bases in the city - officials say their authority will disintegrate and there is likely to be an extraordinary scramble for power in each group."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Last month, T. Y. Chao sold his collection of jade, lovingly assembled over a lifetime, to help pay his shipping company's $850 million in debts. Mr. Chao, whose Wah Kwong Shipping Group is in the middle of a painful restructuring with creditor banks, raised less than $10 million from the jade sale. But if the gesture was more poignant than meaningful, it was a reminder that the industry that created so many fortunes in the past now is erasing them at a dizzying pace. Five Years of Tumbling Rates From the Port of Los Angeles to the docks of Liverpool and the shipyards in South Korea and Japan, the shipping world has been turned upside down by five catastrophic years of tumbling freight rates, rising costs and sinking values of used ships. While the problems are rooted in cyclical overcapacity, many executives now say the downturn is so deep and traumatic that the industry is changing permanently."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"On St. Helena Island, 45 square miles of flat brown salt marshes and vast plantation fields, a dispute over the mailing address used by the United States Postal Service is pitting advocates of a 100-year-old nickname against the descendants of slaves who favor a name four times as old. The island, between Charleston and Hilton Head Island, is the largest of some 15 islands off Beaufort County. It was discovered by the Spanish, who called it St. Helena, about 30 years after Columbus found the New World. The first post office on the island began operating in the mid-1800's on Frogmore Plantation, which is believed to have been named after a mansion and grounds at the royal manor in Windsor, England."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Two prominent Soviet scholars have leveled charges of scientific fraud against an Ohio professor, saying that he plagiarized the 30-year-old work of a Soviet physicist in an engineering textbook published in the United States in 1983. In an article in the Moscow weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta in late October, the Soviet scientists called the American, Hollis C. Chen, who teaches at Ohio University in Athens, ''one of the greatest, most cynical and shameless plagiarizers in the history of science.'' They said several chapters in Professor Chen's textbook, ''Theory of Electromagnetic Waves,'' had been lifted ''virtually in their entirety'' from work published by the Soviet physicist, Fyodor I. Fyodorov, including a book that appeared in Russian as early as 1958. ''Even illustrations wandered into the American book in the form in which they were published by Fyodorov,'' the complainants wrote. ''Occasionally Chen, evidently for camouflage, changes the sequence of formulas or adds relationships of his own that are a trivial consequence of the Fyodorov equations. The total number of formulas 'borrowed' by Chen exceeds a thousand.''"

The bodies of the children, Anthony Gill, 2 1/2, and his 16-month-old sister, Savannah, were found in a bed and the baby sitter, Todd D. Thrane, was found on the floor near the bed, Police Chief Gary Spencer said. ''It appears as if Thrane was trying to rescue the children,'' Chief Spencer said."

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Community centers established to handle disputes such as landlord-tenant disagreements or consumer complaints are a good complement to the traditional court system, a Government report said today. In its report, ''Community Dispute Resolution Programs and Public Policy,'' the National Institute of Justice said 180 cities and towns had set up community dispute resolution centers in the last 15 years. The centers handle minor civil and criminal cases, such as conflicts between consumers and merchants, neighbors, family members, landlords and tenants, and petty criminals and their victims."

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The minister in a black church in Flushing, Queens, began yesterday by quietly preaching about Jesus weeping over Jerusalem. Soon, emotions swelled and churchgoers fell to their knees or stood waving their hands overhead in a spontaneous memorial service for Michael Griffith. The service was held at the Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church in the northern part of the borough, but all thoughts were on a community in the southern part of Queens, Howard Beach. It was there nine days ago that Mr. Griffith died in what the police say was a racially motivated attack."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Pat Ryan or Ken O'Brien, what's the difference? The Kansas City Chiefs, in their preparations last week, concluded there would be few significant differences in the Jets' offense with Ryan at quarterback rather than O'Brien. The Jets would be ''more conservative'' with Ryan, as the veteran Kansas City linebacker, Gary Spani, said later. There would be more emphasis on running plays and shorter pass routes. ''We knew Ryan liked Mickey Shuler, the tight end, while O'Brien will throw the ball downtown,'' Spani said. ''We also knew Ryan was a runner while O'Brien will never run. That's exactly what they did. And we weren't able to stop it. A simple game.''"
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Outward Bound, the rigorous program that develops inner strengths as well as skills in outdoor activities, opened its first school in the United States 25 years ago in a Colorado mountain town. It was an offshoot of a program founded in Wales in World War II to help merchant seamen survive German torpedo attacks by teaching them leadership, teamwork and self-confidence. When Outward Bound began here the program took on a distinctly American character, although its emphasis remained the same. Five schools now offer courses in activities such as white-water rafting and cross-country skiing. But today Outward Bound also helps high school students in New York City to improve their reading skills, Vietnam veterans to cope with their painful memories and cancer patients to adjust to their illness."

It also noted that, by the barest margins, last year missed out on having the worst operating and cash flow margins."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"At times during the final stages of the regular season, the Washington Redskins played without enough patience on offense and aggressiveness on defense, which is like leaving the yeast out of bread. It leaves things sort of flat. Today, however, the Redskins mixed all the proper ingredients into a 19-7 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in the National Conference wild-card game to set the pairings for the divisional round of the playoffs next weekend. The Redskins will move on to face the Chicago Bears next Saturday in Chicago, and on Sunday the Giants will play the San Francisco 49ers for a second time in five weeks, only this time in Giants Stadium. The victory over the Rams was a triumph of style as much as substance, with a big assist from Jess Atkinson, the former Giant kicker who joined the Redskins just before the final game of the regular season. He hadn't kicked a field goal in more than a year and today kicked four, tying a Redskins playoff record."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"THE increasing preoccupation with fitness and weight control among consumers should combine with growing farm surpluses to again fatten the earnings of food companies in 1987. In addition, cost increases for labor and other expenses are expected to be moderate, and food processors and marketers should benefit from the new Federal tax rules. Some analysts would not be surprised to see industry earnings climb 15 percent in 1987, not counting the gains expected from the new tax rules. The earnings of the major food companies are expected to show an aggregate gain of 13 percent this year. This would compare with gains of 11 percent in 1985 and 9 percent in 1984."

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Something happened today for the Jets - the kind of call and the kind of play that often can elevate a team when it is mired in confusion. Here were the Jets, with a five-game losing streak, down 6-0 after one Kansas City drive, and stalled on the Chiefs' 33-yard line in the first quarter. It was a fourth-and-6. A 50-yard field-goal attempt by Pat Leahy into a light wind might not have been unreasonable. Dave Jennings, one of the best in the league at placing punts, might have tried to knock one inside the Chiefs' 20."

The investigators recounted the actions of the motorist, Dominick Blum, on the night of Dec. 19-20 when Michael Griffith was killed, and they provided new details about Mr. Blum's companions, whereabouts and movements, and about the police effort to verify the information. Among other things, the investigators said they had cross-checked Mr. Blum's account with those who were with him, verified seats at a play they had occupied, and found a waiter who recalled serving them at a diner. They retraced the routes taken and administered a lie-detector test to one companion that indicated he was giving a truthful account."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The Jets found themselves, and the Kansas City Chiefs, just in time today. A combination of a revived Jets squad led by a new quarterback and a Chiefs team that could not connect on key plays paced the Jets to a 35-15 wild-card playoff victory today at Giants Stadium. It propelled them to the American Conference divisional playoffs against the Browns in Cleveland next Saturday - in other words, two victories from a Super Bowl appearance. First, however, the Jets had to win. They brought in the burden of their five-game losing streak that had brought, according to Dan Alexander, ''everyone in the nation down on us except my mother.''"
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"John Cardinal O'Connor said today that he considered calling off his trip to Israel because of the embarrassment caused by his last-minute decision, under Vatican orders, to cancel meetings with Israel's President and Prime Minister. But Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, said he ultimately concluded, after talking with Israeli officials in New York, that calling off the trip would have been a ''foolish thing to do'' and ''totally inappropriate.'' ''I made a mistake, and it resulted in some embarrassment for some Government officials,'' he said. ''But I would have to be naive to think that Prime Minister Shamir and President Herzog have never been in an embarrassing position, that they would not be sensitive to a mistake made by someone they know to have great respect for them.''"
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"For the nation's computer industry, 1986 was the year when the long-awaited consolidation of I.B.M.'s competitors began in earnest. And if the computer and electronics business fails to improve soon - and there is little evidence it will - more mergers and cutbacks are likely. The biggest combination of the year was the purchase of the Sperry Corporation by the Burroughs Corporation, a $4.4 billion merger that created the world's second-largest computer maker - though one that is still less than a fourth the size of the International Business Machines Corporation."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Next year, corporate boards may have a harder time fighting off suitors because of some key judicial decisions this year. In 1985, the judiciary had given corporate boards the green light to use powerful new weapons to fight takeover bids, but 1986 will be remembered as the year when many courts posted a ''Caution'' sign to directors who adopt defensive measures. In a half-dozen important cases, the courts weighed whether ''poison pills'' - measures that make takeovers prohibitively expensive - were being used as legitimate tools to deter inadequate offers or as an inappropriate way to entrench management. In several cases, courts rejected pills on the ground that they interfered with the shareholders' aim of obtaining the highest price for their stock."

He was 70 years old and had moved to Chicago in 1984 from Greenwich, Conn. Mr. Sherer, who was known as Bud, retired from the Foreign Service in 1979 after two years at the United Nations Security Council and two more at international conferences and other assignments.

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In ''The Word for Takeovers: Pernicious'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 6), Walter Kissinger makes a number of points that my own experience has found to be otherwise and others in which his argument is flawed. Mr. Kissinger begins by claiming that the Ivan F. Boesky insider-trading scandal has succeeded, at last, in awakening people to the evils of hostile takeovers. If it has, it has awakened people to the wrong issue. Mr. Boesky's illegal operations, whatever sums they encompassed, were no more than a tangential outgrowth of a fundamental macroeconomic process occurring inevitably throughout the industrialized world. It can no more attest to the evils of takeovers than the presence of a gambler who has succeeded in persuading a college athlete to shave points in a basketball game can indict the fundamentally healthy drive and legitimacy of young men and women to participate in competitive sports."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"It is hunting time in American retailing as the industry undergoes the greatest transformation of ownership in its history. If 1986 was the year of mergers, consolidations, divestiture and reorganization among the nation's stores, predictions on Wall Street and within the industry are that 1987 will be the same and perhaps even more so. Realization that parts of a company may be more valuable than the whole has gripped the imagination of financiers and acquisition-minded retailers. Price-earnings multiples that are still low for many listed retailing companies have been a spur to action, as has the valuable real estate that so many retailers command."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"After prospering in relative obscurity for 20 years, a rapidly growing manufacturing program in Mexico has become a focus of increasing concern in the United States. Labor and Congressional leaders say it poses the kind of threat to American jobs that is usually associated with the Far East. At issue is the hugely successful twin-plant, or maquiladora, program, in which foreign goods, most of them from American companies, are assembled at low-wage Mexican manufacturing plants and then shipped back across the border at reduced duties. The rapidly growing program is being hailed in Mexico as the most positive development on the nation's economic scene, and it is being enthusiastically pushed by economic development groups in America's economically depressed border communities. Anger Over Loss of Jobs But it is coming under fire from labor groups and Northern members of Congress who say the program has become an increasingly potent incentive to relocate American manufacturing jobs across the border."

''It was unavoidable,'' said the 49-year-old Chicago native, who is now the chairman and chief executive of the Commonwealth Edison Company, one of the nation's largest utilities. Recently, Mr. O'Connor has been spending a lot of time after work in his Chicago office crafting a rate plan that would radically change the status of three nuclear power plants Edison currently has under construction.

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"More and more college students are borrowing more and more money under Federal programs, raising concern that debt will overburden a generation of Americans, a Congressional report said today. As Federal loans to students have almost tripled in the last 10 years, while grants that do not have to be repaid have declined sharply, a third to a half of all undergraduates now leave school in debt, according to the report released by the Joint Economic Committee. More research is needed, it says, to determine how such debt affects students' later lives, including their ability to pursue further studies, their choices of career, and their decisions to marry and bear children. Burden on Families Growing The study showed that paying for college has become a much heavier burden for families than it was a decade ago, according to Representative David Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who has been chairman of the committee, and Senator Paul Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat succeeding him. ''College costs have risen sharply, up about 10 percent in real dollars for public institutions and up by more than 25 percent at private ones, while family income has remained stagnant,'' the legislators said in a joint statement."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"For 26 days, the Knicks underwent a transition from one coaching philosophy to another that could not have been more traumatic. They were asked to forget that they had been conditioned to respond to the whims of one man, to adhere to the confines of his system or risk the punishment of public embarrassment. Now, they were told to play, as the players call it, ''their game.'' They were free to run and shoot almost as they pleased. And they were ordered to, most importantly, enjoy themselves. That the transition period occurred during the regular season, without the benefit of a training camp or exhibition games, was reflected in the team's dismal results."

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"In traveling to Israel John Cardinal O'Connor is wandering into an area of Vatican foreign policy that is as delicate as it is ambiguous. Although more than 100 nations have diplomatic missions accredited to the Holy See, the Vatican has never established full diplomatic relations with Israel. Vatican officials are often quick to note that the absence of full diplomatic ties does not mean that the Vatican refuses to ''recognize'' Israel or that it somehow denies Israel's existence."

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"A few hundred years ago, in the rich wilderness that is now New York State and beyond, the Oneida Indians, at peace with other tribes and themselves, formed a thriving community. They eventually became allies of George Washington, supplying food to his troops at Valley Forge during the harsh winter of 1778. Today, the last of the Oneidas in New York number under a thousand. Largely impoverished, afflicted by high rates of unemployment and alcoholism, they are also a people bitterly divided. Their feud involves history, politics, philosophy and many millions of dollars. In recent days, an effort has been made to settle the conflict. The outcome, some American Indian leaders believe, could have a significant impact not only on the future of the Oneidas in New York, but also on Federal-Indian relations nationwide."

The financial columns report that the American fur industry is reaching new heights of prosperity, approaching a record $2 billion mark in 1986. What those ads and stories don't point out is that to experience these ''wonderful'' feelings and to drape those tots in furs and to realize the ''fuzzy fantasies'' and to enjoy those bulging profits, it is necessary to pay a certain price. The price is paid, however, not by the fur-wearers but by the fur-bearers."

Now Robert Wagner Jr., president of the Board of Education, argues that the system has become so mired in politics and patronage as to stifle educational reform. His criticisms, though justified, have raised fears that he means to scrap the present system of decentralization. So far, those fears are unwarranted."

The man, Alfonso DelSanto, 38 years old, was arrested Saturday and charged with first-degree assault in the attack Friday at the couple's home here, said Sgt. Edward Lawrence of the New York State Park Police in Babylon, L.I. The man's wife, Carol DelSanto, 42, remained in critical condition at Yale-New Haven Hospital yesterday. A passing motorist found her lying by the road in front of the couple's Tudor-style home at about 7:30 P.M. Friday, the police said."

The problem is particularly critical for working parents whose salaries are too high to make them eligible for public assistance but not high enough for them to afford private baby sitters. Of the 5,000 places available, all but 234 are for children whose parents qualify for some kind of public assistance, according to Child Care Inc., an advocacy group. But these 234 licensed spaces, in 119 family day care homes throughout the city, are slowly being added to as a handful of community groups and churches work to get certification for day care providers."

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Dark and abandoned on the East Side, factories that once helped to make this city one of the most important manufacturing centers in the United States now stand as a symbol of the nation's industrial decline. But just up the road from this industrial ghost town, a bustling campus-like complex of neat lawns and buildings has become one of Cleveland's great hopes for rejuvenating its economy. This oasis in a desert of urban decay is the Cleveland Clinic, the medical institution that has gained international renown for its treatment of cardiovascular disease and other serious illnesses. Lately, though, the Cleveland Clinic has earned another distinction: Its 8,879 employees make it the city's largest private employer, edging out the LTV Steel Company, the nation's second-largest steelmaker, which is now in bankruptcy proceedings. A Star in the Service Economy Economists and political leaders have voiced concern that the transformation of the United States from a manufacturing-based to a service-based economy would leave in its wake a country of hamburger flippers. But a look at the clinic, with its assortment of low- and high-powered jobs and the prominent role it has come to play in the local economy, shows this is not necessarily so."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The problem with friends is that most people don't feel they have enough of them. ''Or they think the friendships they have aren't close enough,'' said Letty Cottin Pogrebin. ''I interviewed so many people who had rich social lives, yet they were all so worried that they were missing something. When friendship is involved, people really believe they are somehow lacking. They worry if they're calling enough. They feel guilty. They worry that their friends go to others when they want close companionship.'' Ms. Pogrebin herself shared these concerns, as did many of the 150 people she interviewed for her new book, ''Among Friends: Who We Like, Why We Like Them, and What We Do With Them'' (McGraw-Hill, $19.95). Yet the reality was ''that most everyone had a best friend, and many had incredibly satisfying networks of friends,'' she said. ''Even then, they felt their friendships weren't all they could be.''"

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The price of a gallon of unleaded regular is down below a dollar, and while OPEC has finally agreed to a modest price increase, few analysts believe the squabbling cartel will be able to make it stick. That means our energy policy is working, right? Wrong, oh so wrong. Unless Washington stops focusing on the prices at the gas pump and starts looking at the prices and dependency just over the horizon, the United States will be in deep trouble all over again."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The man was perhaps in his late 40's, and he wore the dark sunglasses that for years had been the trademark of the Tontons Macoute, the thugs who had been the enforcers of the dynastic Duvalier dictatorship. He averted a handshake with a foreigner and moved away on the cool, shaded patio to avoid conversation. He would not say who he was. Neither would the two men with him, although eventually one of them did allow a conversation to begin."

The official Tass news agency said Mr. Yermash, 63 years old, was replaced as head of the state film industry by Aleksandr I. Kamshalov, 54, a former teacher and official of the Communist Youth League. The agency said Mr. Yermash was replaced by decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the national parliament."

Analysts and machine tool manufacturing officials attributed the decline to the same factors that have plagued the industry for the entire year: the sluggish economy and confusion surrounding the impact of recent changes in tax laws. The decline came just a month after a sharp 30.1 percent increase in October from the previous month's levels. Industry analysts had attributed that surge to a large volume of new orders that followed the International Machine Tool Show in Chicago in early September."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"CONSIDERED by many to be the Great Reflector of society at large, television entertainment is watched closely for supposed trends. During the last several years, for instance, a somewhat conservative bent in manners and life styles has been detected among the inhabitants of television sitcoms and movies. Marriage is in again, having children is fun, making money is bliss - that sort of thing. What, then, is one supposed to make of ''Blue DeVille,'' the television movie being slipped into NBC's schedule tonight at 9? Here is a genially dopey on-the-road caper that laughingly rejects weddings and family togetherness in favor of having, as the writers put it, ''some stupid, crazy times.'' The executive producers and writers, Eugenie Ross-Leming and Brad Buckner, begin their tale in St. Louis. J. C. Swift (Jennifer Runyon), looking like Barbie come to life, is about to marry upwardly mobile Kevin (Robert Prescott) and assume an obviously promising position in her father's company. J. C. spends a good deal of her time at home doing crossword puzzles. Meanwhile, Gus Valentine (Kimberly Pistone) is saying goodbye to her mother (Micole Mercurio), an aging hippie concerned about nobody but herself. Gus, for Augusta, is on her own, setting out for Colorado in search of the Vietnam-veteran father she has never met. To envision Gus, think of Cyndi Lauper."

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Just when it seems the last Pearl Harbor attack story has been told, a new one crops up. The latest fills out the tale of a Japanese pilot who tried to take over the small island of Niihau after crash-landing his Zero there on Dec. 7, 1941. Shigenori Nishikaichi landed on Niihau, expecting to be picked up by a submarine, after his plane took a bullet through the gas tank while he was strafing an Army airfield on Oahu, according to a series of articles in The Honolulu Star-Bulletin. The paper interviewed survivors and used Freedom of Information statutes to obtain Government documents not previously available."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Senator Mark Andrews, a North Dakota Republican who is among a group of departing senators who are seeking new jobs, has been campaigning to succeed Carl Bagge as president of the National Coal Association. Mr. Bagge, who has become something of a Washington institution during his 17 years at the helm of the coal companies' group, is retiring next year for health reasons. Although most former lawmakers are more likely to seek other sorts of positions, such as joining prestigious law firms, there is a precedent for the Andrews move. In 1970, after losing to a Republican, William E. Brock, now the Secretary of Labor, Senator Albert Gore Sr., Democrat of Tennessee, surprised many colleagues and constituents when he became the chairman of the Island Creek Coal Company."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The year of the Constitution is upon us. Through 1987 we shall be celebrating the 200th birthday of the extraordinary document that created our country. There is every reason to celebrate. But there is also reason to wonder whether we really understand and believe in the essential idea of the Constitution. The men who framed it in Philadelphia 200 years ago put their faith in limited government. They had seen unlimited power in the hands of the King and they feared it. So they divided power in the government they made, hedged it about with rules, made it accountable to the people."

The 3 1/4-by-8 1/2-inch booklet contains rebate coupons on hard goods with a combined value of $1,000. ''This is new, it's never been done before,'' said Earle Bower, president of Earle Bower Associates, the ad agency that will be promoting the book. The idea is his and he has an equity position in Rebate Books Inc., of 350 Lexington Avenue, of which Nancy E. Kieffer is president. He called it ''a marketing program for consumer durables companies.''"
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The people who champion causes, who know how to form committees and call on their connections to get things done, are as much a part of the life of New York as the artist and the author. They are part banker, advertiser, public relations director and legal counsel. They work long hours, trade contacts, raise capital and wield influence. Elinor Guggenheimer, 74 years old, knows that world intimately. She has served on the National Committee for the Day Care of Children, been chairman of both the Day Care Council of New York and the Council of Senior Centers and Services. She was vice president of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and has served on the boards of numerous organizations. She has also been a public servant, with positions on the New York Planning Commission and a tenure as the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs. She was once a candidate for City Council President."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has made substantial progress in carrying out the most extensive managerial and technical review in its history, according to space officials and outside experts. The agency appears well on its way to repairing defects blamed for the disaster last January that grounded the space shuttles. And it has begun to reorganize its faulty management structure along the lines recommended by the Presidential commission that investigated the accident, which killed the seven Challenger crew members. In only 11 months, a vast majority of the top officials in shuttle operations have been replaced. NASA headquarters in Washington has a new Administrator, a new Deputy Administrator and a new Associate Administrator for Space Flight; the directors of NASA's three most important field centers have changed; and all the key engineering managers at the Marshall Space Flight Center who were faulted in the accident have been swept out."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The whole world is going bananas. Here I am, home on the ranch, and what do I see? I see the Russians giving Sakharov a television studio to broadcast to all the American television networks, and Gorby's men smiling as that fearless dissident denounces the Red Army's occupation of Afghanistan. Crazy. I see Chinese students rioting against Deng for being too slow on democracy, and the authorities in Beijing patting the kids on the head and telling them to go home and be nice. Unbelievable."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"In an age when electronic gadgets and games are everywhere, many teachers, librarians and private citizens are betting that Americans can be encouraged to develop a love affair with the printed word. With the help of a recently enacted Federal law, they hope to refocus attention on reading and books. The Federal measure is Public Law 99-494, signed two months ago by President Reagan. Officially designating 1987 as the Year of the Reader, the law is further designed to encourage efforts ''aimed at restoring the act of reading to a place of pre-eminence in our personal lives and in the life of our nation.''"

For 13 seasons, he watched other people cavort in the playoffs, long after the New Orleans Saints had turned in their playbooks for the year. But this year Derland Moore did something about it: He defected. Went over the border. Split. Packed it in. Went home and waited for the phone to ring. ''The percentages were against me,'' Moore said yesterday, after participating in the first postseason game in his honorable 14-year professional career."

On Saturday, St. John's overcame a 10-point deficit and defeated defensive-minded Virginia, 64-58, in the first round of the Eastern College Athletic Conference Holiday Festival at Madison Square Garden. Tonight, the Redmen face an even tougher test when they meet Georgia Tech (5-2) in the championship game. The Yellow Jackets, who advanced by defeating Rutgers, 79-61, are nearly a mirror image of St. John's, with speed and size on the wings, talent at one guard spot and adequate play at center."

One of these friends, Charles Z. Wick, director of the United States Information Agency, has been especially close to President Reagan in recent days. Mr. Wick spent Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with Mr. Reagan and plans to join the Reagans on New Years Eve in Palm Springs at the estate of Walter Annenberg, the millionaire publisher and friend of the Reagans. ''The President has great resilience, great self-confidence, his mood is certainly not one of being battered,'' said Mr. Wick, a former Hollywood agent and business executive. ''His mood is, 'Let's get the job done and do what's necessary.' ''"
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The bowl games this New Year's Day may be remembered more for steroids than for any meaningful game. Two all-America players were among a handful of athletes declared ineligible by the National Collegiate Athletic Association for their team's games because they tested positive for anabolic steroids. Brian Bosworth, the flamboyant Oklahoma linebacker, will not play in the Orange Bowl, and Jeff Bregel, the Southern California offensive guard, will miss the Florida Citrus Bowl. It will be one of the very few times in football history that a team won a bowl game and then was voted the national championship without playing that game on New Year's Day. The meaningful game comes Friday night when Miami and Penn State, ranked first and second by the news-agency polls, meet in the Fiesta Bowl."

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Boxing will look back on the 1980's as a decade of sad decline in the heavyweight division. Except for Larry Holmes, and perhaps Michael Spinks - a special case as a very good light heavyweight who stepped up in class for the larger purses - the landscape has been dotted by a procession of mediocre titleholders whose reigns have lasted roughly as long as the fragrance of the cheapest perfume. It has been an era of revolving-door champions, and devotees can only hope that the emergence of Mike Tyson signals its demise."

The former technician, Mordechai Vanunu, was taken to Jerusalem District Court at 5 this morning in a curtained van and escorted in with burlap covering his body and a red umbrella held by one of his 10 police guards covering his face. The early hour was apparently chosen in an effort to prevent him from passing any more messages to the press. Last Monday, Mr. Vanunu held up a message written on his hand that suggested he had been abducted by Israeli agents in Italy. He also managed to shout to reporters the word ''Rome!'' Two Italian newspapers said they had confirmed that Mr. Vanunu was registered on British Airways flight 504 from London to Rome on Sept. 30."

From a modest beginning in 1946 with the sale of a short story for $25, Mr. MacDonald's writing career blossomed to produce about 70 books.

In a city where information is power, no place is sacred. But some places - rest rooms, elevators, the Eastern shuttle and Germaine's, a favored spot for Washington journalists - are less sacred than others."

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Your report of increased military tensions on the Norwegian-Soviet border (news story, Dec. 7) casts a distorted light upon Soviet-Norwegian relations and their prospects, as well as on the situation in northern Europe as a whole. And, of course, the statement that ''the Kremlin is rapidly turning the nearby Kola Peninsula into what Western officials call a huge concentration of Soviet military power'' is absurd. During his recent meeting in Moscow with the Prime Minister of Norway, General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev made it pointedly clear that the Soviet Union has ''no malicious intentions with regard to Norway and that we in the Soviet Union have longstanding friendly feelings toward your people.''"

Lazar was a partner obtained an apparently bogus document and used it to get public financing of a $6.8 million Brooklyn apartment building. Spokesmen for both offices said the investigations centered on a New York City certificate of occupancy submitted by Rose Garden Associates to Federal, state and city agencies in 1984. Mr. Lazar and the other principal partner in the firm, Samuel Pompa, in interviews last month, said they had nothing to do with obtaining the document, which authorities have said was fictitious.

In 1986 thus far, there have been at least 1,000 children who fall into this category in hospitals throughout the city. * The recent increase in the number of these children is due to drug abuse and AIDS-related cases."

Another patient, a 45-year-old man, admitted bullying his wife into doing his bidding, using the same study to convince the wife that she would have no chance of finding anyone else if he became dissatisfied and left. These are not isolated incidents. Mental-health professionals say it is no longer unusual for people to base important life decisions or strategies on the findings of generalized studies."

In it, the writer Nathan Zuckerman and his English wife, Maria, have just returned home from celebrating her 28th birthday at a London restaurant. During dinner, Nathan is the target of an anti-Semitic outburst from a woman at a neighboring table. Earlier in the evening, at a reception at the end of a Christmas carol service at a church in the West End, Maria's older sister, Sarah, attacks Nathan's Jewishness. She warns him not to ''stand in the way of a christening'' after Maria gives birth to their child. Now, at the end of a nerve-racking day, Nathan begins to press Maria for her real feelings about his Jewishness."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Like a lot of other boys growing up around Lawrenceville, Ill., Doug Novsek had a basketball hoop in his driveway and learned to shoot under the country sky. A 20-footer was a shot he could make stepping out of the kitchen with a bologna sandwich in one hand."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"International Thomson Business Press's CES Publishing has bought Convenience Store Merchandiser magazine, having earlier this year acquired four monthly retail magazines from United States Business Press. The latest purchase, from Associates Business Publications, brings the total of CES titles to 12. Stuart J. Horton, president of CES, was quoted as saying he hoped to keep most of the magazine's people, including Wayne Pierce, publisher."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"THE competition offers huge stadiums right on their campuses, not far from where the alums spent some of the best times of their youth. Here, the campus stadium is an unrealized dream as old as the institution itself. Traditionally, the members of college football's elite have supplied a background of ivy-covered buildings constructed when our great-grandparents were young. Each time a team from the University of Miami competes, its nickname holds the reminder of a crippling storm. The hurricane struck on Sept. 16, 1926, killing more than 130 people and damaging more than 10,000 homes. On Oct. 15, the new university began classes in the abandoned Anastasia Hotel, with rooms created by cardboard partitions. Eight days later, the school known as the Cardboard College played its first football game, a victory over a freshman team from Rollins College, before a crowd of 304 on a hastily-built field without grass."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The Nomura Securities Company, the world's-largest brokerage house, extended its reach into the United States real estate industry yesterday with the acquisition of a half-interest in Eastdil Realty Inc., the innovative real estate investment banking firm founded by Benjamin V. Lambert. Real estate analysts said the deal, through an affiliate known as Nomura Babcock & Brown Real Estate Inc., was worth more than $50 million to Mr. Lambert and the 15 other stockholders in Eastdil. As part of the agreement, Eastdil will serve as Nomura's real estate investment arm in the United States, as the giant securities dealer joins other Japanese companies in expanding its share of the real estate business here. Earlier this year, in the first step in its expansion strategy, Nomura purchased an interest in Babcock & Brown, a mortgage broker."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Despite widespread efforts by merchants and financial institutions to combat it, credit-card fraud is still a huge, worldwide problem, and a problem that gets worse at Christmas, when stores are jammed and credit card use peaks. ''It's the biggest volume period for us, and the fraud goes up correspondingly,'' said William D. Neumann, a former F.B.I. agent who is now chief of security at Visa. ''The sales clerks are often part-timers, and frauds figure that if they are going to cheat, Christmas is the time to do it.'' Although heightened law enforcement has actually led to a decline in losses from card fraud in percentage terms, to around 15 hundredths of 1 percent of credit-card sales, worldwide fraud losses this year at Mastercard International Inc. and Visa U.S.A. Inc. will still exceed $200 million, experts say. That is up from roughly $125 million in 1982. Fraud losses from counterfeit Visa and Mastercard cards alone, which law-enforcement officials thought they could eliminate through such anti-counterfeiting tools as holograms, will exceed $30 million."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In an editorial ''Topics'' (Dec. 7) about a family traveling through Newark Airport, you suggest that there is no reason that both men's and women's restrooms could not have a changing room for babies -no reason except the assumption that changing diapers is women's work. Thanks to a law suit filed in Federal court, changing diapers is no longer ''women's work'' in Syracuse."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Tens of thousands of university students in China have risked their future careers by demanding democratic freedoms that are guaranteed in the Constitution but denied by China's leaders. Why? Having traveled in China for more than two months last summer and fall, I can testify to the depths of disillusionment with Deng Xiaoping's reforms that motivate such courageous, dedicated behavior. In private talks, whether in the northernmost city of Harbin or southern Guangzhou, coastal Shanghai or interior Wuhan, the alienation felt by men and women in their 20's and 30's was uniformly communicated. Part of the disillusionment began in September 1985 when students, in their first demonstrations in this decade, protested Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's homage to Japan's fallen soldiers, including war criminals executed after World War II, at the Yasakuni Shrine in Tokyo. Several hundred demonstrators managed to parade publicly in Beijing, but on most campuses meetings were confined indoors. Anxious officials conciliated student unrest with better food, increased allowances and lengthy discussion of grievances, including Japan's dominant role in China's economic modernization. But the bottom line was clear: no more demonstrations."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The House of Representatives, faced with union organizers, unhappy employees and mounting deficits, is getting out of the restaurant business. Under an arrangement approved by a House Administration subcommittee, a private company, the Service America Corporation, is scheduled Jan. 3 to begin operating the members' dining room, two large cafeterias for the public and House staff and five take-out restaurants. The same 245 employees will continue cooking, serving and cleaning up, but changing to a private contractor will mean, at least for the time being, forfeiting a pay increase and some fringe benefits."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Beginning Sunday, the writers Denis Donoghue, Cynthia Ozick and Marilynne Robinson will join Anatole Broyard in the About Books column of The New York Times Book Review. The column, which has been printed monthly, will now appear weekly."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"SEMESTER finals were completed and a cold, gray morning was brightened by the prospect of going home for the holidays. But as their fellow students packed their bags, some assisted by parents playing chauffeur for a day, the Penn State football players prepared for a weekend that would be the equivalent of the first days of fall practice, a time of pure drudgery. As many of them already knew, not all college finals are given in the classroom. Dressed in sweatsuits or jeans, some with wool caps pulled down over their ears, the players wandered sleepy-eyed into the dining hall, beginning at 8:15 A.M., mostly in pairs or groups of three, many not bothering to remove their jackets or hats. They sat like zombies over plates of bacon and scrambled eggs, tater tots and cold cereal - a football player's breakfast of champions - eating from habit."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Congratulations to North High School of Great Neck, L.I., for joining the ranks of non-class-ranking schools (news story, Dec. 16)! And fie on Joseph J. Biscoglio, who voted against it at Bronxville High - and he a guidance director! You have to be evaluated compared with others in life, he says."

1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"When Jenny leaves for work as a bar hostess in the evenings, her live-in boyfriend, an American sailor, sometimes calls after her jokingly, ''Don't catch AIDS, now.'' Jenny, a small and delicate woman of 18 whose mother was a prostitute and whose father was an American serviceman, says she calls back, ''I hope not.'' In fact, although her boyfriend does not know and she herself seems to be confused about it, Jenny is already infected with the AIDS virus. Based on her account, it seems probable that she was infected by one of the many American servicemen with whom she has had sexual contact since she came to work two years ago in the garish bars that cluster around Subic Bay Naval Station."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"In lackluster trading the last few weeks, credit market participants have appeared content to accept the standard forecast: a weakening of the economy in the first quarter, accompanied by an easier monetary policy and lower interest rates. The complacent attitude has left Treasury bond yields little changed in the last several weeks, and still in the middle portion of the range that has prevailed since April. The newest 30-year issue, the 7 1/2 percent bonds due in 2016, were offered Friday at 102 2/ 32, to yield 7.33 percent. ''Clearly this is a market with a bullish bias,'' analysts at Griggs & Santow noted in their latest newsletter. They noted that the bond market seems to have overlooked certain devolpments, such as stronger-than-expected economic data and higher short-term interest rates."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Pat Cash staged the comeback of his life today to give Australia its 26th Davis Cup triumph. Cash, who recovered from a back injury and an appendectomy in 1986 to improve his world ranking from 418th to 24th, beat Mikael Pernfors, 2-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3, to clinch the victory for Australia over Sweden, which had won the trophy the last two years. ''This is a fantastic feeling,'' the 21-year-old Cash said. ''In a way, this is my greatest moment in tennis.''"
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Three Trenton State Prison inmates escaped from their cell by chiseling through the ceiling but were recaptured yesterday when an alert correction officer spotted them in the prison yard, a correction department spokesman said. The inmates used a makeshift rope to lower themselves 25 feet from the roof of their cellblock, the spokesman, James Stabile, said."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,Listed below are the target release dates for major economic indicators scheduled to be released this week.
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"When David H. Komansky switched from the securities side to the real estate side of Merrill Lynch & Company some 15 months ago ''it was the beginning of an adventure,'' he said. The adventure is continuing, with plans announced by Merrill Lynch last week to convert its real estate operation into a master limited partnership, retaining control but selling units to the public. Mr. Komansky, who is president of Merrill Lynch Realty, will be head of a Merrill Lynch subsidiary to be created to act as general partner under the plan."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"PHYLLIS LAMHUT'S dances once tended to be witty, solidly crafted little gems. With ''Passing,'' created in 1980, her pieces took on a look of grandeur and became larger and more spectacular. And her current work refers increasingly to the expressionism that is the modern-dance heritage of Ms. Lamhut, long a dancer with Alwin Nikolais, who himself claims the lineage of Mary Wigman, the German Expressionist modern-dance choreographer. ''Klein Kunst'' (''Small Art''), a full-evening work performed on Saturday at Dance Theater Workshop's Bessie Schonberg Theater, seems at first to belong unequivocally to Ms. Lamhut's recent body of clearly expressionistic dance. But the piece also recalls her earlier, thematically slighter dances."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Big business in America is overhauling itself and its operations faster than at any time since World War II. Corporations are shucking unrelated product lines, marrying or buying up competitors and rejiggering their finances in hopes of restoring growth and prosperity. These wrenching changes promise higher short-term profits to shareholders, but have loaded many companies with unprecedented levels of debt, raising widespread concern about the companies' ability to weather any recessions that may lie ahead. Billions Change Hands This year, the rush to streamline and to concentrate energies on more narrowly defined lines of business has fueled a record of more than $150 billion in mergers and acquisitions that transferred corporate assets from one set of hands to another. In addition, according to the investment banking firm of Salomon Brothers Inc., in the first 11 months of 1986 some 233 companies bought back, or announced plans to buy back, an estimated $36 billion of their own stock, making themselves less vulnerable to takeovers."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"THE deteriorating state of large segments of the nation's infrastructure, particularly in the Northeast and Middle West, is due to get heightened attention from the next Congress. The price tag for rectifying the problem, according to a number of studies, could be several hundred billion dollars and require the kind of public and private sector partnerships that have become increasingly attractive to the Federal Government, albeit on a selective basis."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The Reagan Administration is expected to remove most controls before the end of January on exports of oil and gas equipment and technology to the Soviet Union, Administration trade officials said this weekend. The move would be a response both to the depressed conditions of the American industry and the reluctance of United States allies to impose similar export restraints. The industry and its supporters contend that European and Japanese suppliers have picked up business that might have otherwise gone to American exporters. Share Less Than 2 Percent The American share of total Western exports of such equipment has fallen from 25 percent before the ban eight years ago to less than 2 percent today, according to figures from the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"DUMB fun, bad attitudes and rude noise are vital to rock-and-roll, and as the music absorbs one shock tactic, along comes another. Right now, there's a new kind of rude rock in the making. It mixes two styles that grate on parents and appeal directly to teen-agers: rap and heavy metal. Run-D. M. C. pioneered rap-metal music with ''Rock Box''; the Beastie Boys, abetted by Run-D. M. C.'s producer, Rick Rubin, have made rap-metal music a vehicle for teen-agers' jokey, antisocial fantasies. On their album, ''Licensed to Ill,'' the three Beastie Boys - King Ad-Rock (Adam Horovitz), Mike D (Michael Diamond) and the hoarse-voiced MCA (Adam Yauch) - are loudmouthed brats backed by loud guitars and a lean rhythm-box beat."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"A thick blanket of fog descended on Hartsfield International Airport today, grounding all flights out of the busy air hub and leading to delayed flights all over the nation. ''The weather went down about 7 this morning and was pretty bad,'' said Jack Barker, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"A few years before he received the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature, the Sicilian playwright Luigi Pirandello, one of the 20th century's great innovators in the theater, wrote another letter to Marta Abba, a leading Italian stage and screen actress, who inspired several of his plays. ''I write with my mind's eye fixed on you,'' he wrote. ''Should your divine inspiring image abandon me for an instant, I would not be able to move ahead with one single word. Without realizing it, from far away, maybe not even thinking at all about me, consumed by other thoughts, by other preoccupations, you are doing the work for me. You, with all the power of your art, the tones of your inimitable voice, with the splendor of your eyes, which find the expression for each passion."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Many New York corporations are matching gifts made by their employees to the 75th annual appeal of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Among those companies are the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, Chemical Bank, Reader's Digest, Newsweek magazine and Avon Products. Gifts that are to be matched by companies came from Laura Shapiro of Manhattan, $300; Lynn and Arthur Boulanger of Flushing, Queens, $50; Mary L. Ciecierski of Manhattan, $25; Alison M. Martier of Manhattan, $50; Tonya and Robert Stallworth of Brooklyn, $300; Deborah and Leonard B. Gordon of Manhattan, $250, and John E. Long of Manhattan, $500."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"For three years, people here have known their community was going to be the home of the nation's MX missile system. So when Pentagon officials announced last week that the first 10 MX missiles had been installed in underground silos and were ready for launching if needed, many Cheyenne residents paid little attention. ''It hasn't made the slightest difference in my life style,'' said G. John Veta, president of Western Ranchman Outfitters, a downtown clothing store. ''Why the tremendous to-do about the MX? We've had Minuteman 3 missiles here for years.''"
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"''Hello,'' starts one note penned by a 15-year-old schoolgirl. ''Elephant fails and cannot stand up. Dele Giwa, good-bye.'' Another, typed by a college student, contains an ode to ''Giwa, the Honest and Patriotic Son of the African soil.'' Mourning a man they never met, these letter writers are two of thousands of Nigerians who recently have flooded the offices of Newswatch, Nigeria's largest news magazine."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"AN impish-eyed lug of a man who totes a suitcase full of props onto the stage, the 28-year-old Long Island-based comedian Bob Nelson has a special knack for spoofing athletes whose dumbness is exceeded only by their hulking arrogance. In this vein, Mr. Nelson, who is appearing at Caroline's, 332 Eighth Avenue, at 26th Street, through tomorrow, has perfected a routine that may become a comedy classic, as he portrays a football player doing a live television commercial for the United Way at halftime."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"The New York String Orchestra, an ensemble of 60 musicians from 15 to 22 years old from schools across the country, will play Vivaldi's Concerto in C minor for Violin and String Orchestra (''Il Sospetto'') under the direction of Alexander Schneider in a concert at Carnegie Hall tonight at 8."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"He coached in the big-time spotlight for so long, and so enjoyed the attention heaped not only on his teams but also on his notable wisecracking, that the thought of his prospering in a low-profile milieu would once have seemed incongruous. But life in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics has been kind to Abe Lemons, whose Oklahoma City University squad has a 13-0 record this season and a No. 1 N.A.I.A. national ranking. During three decades in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I, spanning an earlier tenure at Oklahoma City as well as stays at Pan American and Texas, Lemons never quite made it to the national championship. In his first stint at Oklahoma City, he did take the Chiefs to six N.C.A.A. tourneys and five National Invitation Tournaments from 1956 to 1973, but by the time he returned there in 1983 (having been dismissed by Texas a year earlier), the program was in shambles. The Midwestern Cities Conference's minimum-seating regulation forced the Chiefs, whose gym can accommodate only 3,600, to play their games in a large arena off campus, and the rent was such that they were losing money whether they traveled or stayed home."
1986-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Hours before the Aeroflot daily flight was scheduled to depart from Kennedy International Airport to Moscow, Taras Kordonsky sat in the terminal eating and repeatedly looking at his Swiss watch. He had come to the United States from the Soviet Union eight years ago ''to discover the western world.'' Now he was part of a group of five dozen Russians preparing to start the 14-hour journey home, the largest group of Russian emigres ever to return to the Soviet Union from this country."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"What is the name of the country's largest agency specializing in marine goods? You were wrong if you said Wolff Whitehill Advertising, but only by a few days."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"THE nation's work force is expected to grow only moderately in 1987, but some industries are likely to show significant employment gains, labor analysts say. Richard Belous, labor economist for the Conference Board, a business research organization, said the economy was strong enough to generate two million jobs in 1987, about equal to the growth in the labor force. He added that unemployment would continue at around 7 percent, or eight million people. Manpower Inc., a nationwide firm that deals in temporary services, took a survey of 13,000 employers and said it was not very sanguine about the job outlook. Mitchell S. Fromstein, Manpower's president, noted ''a weak but relatively stable hiring pattern for the first quarter.'' Regional differences are apparent, he said, citing the ''Northeast corridor as clearly having a better outlook than the country as a whole.''"
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Libyan troops seized control of a strategic oasis in northern Chad today after more than two weeks of heavy fighting against Chadian forces, French officials said. According to the Chadian Government, the town that was reported overrun, Zouar, is one of three crucial points in Libya's plan to regain control of the northern Tibesti region. The other points are said to be the towns of Bardai, north of Zouar, and Wour, in the west."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"The Eastman Kodak Company said it would raise prices on most of its consumer and professional photo products, including all Kodacolor film formats, effective Jan. 24. A Kodak spokesman, Henry K. Kaska, said the increases would range from 3 percent to 6 percent. Prices on photographic paper will increase, Kodak said, but photofinishing charges and videotape prices will remain the same."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"''LA BAYADERE,'' one of the classics of the 19th-century Russian ballet repertory, can be seen tonight at 10 o'clock on the Bravo cable network in a fine performance by the Kirov Ballet of Leningrad, the company for which it was originally choreographed by Marius Petipa in 1877. Back then, the Kirov was known as the Maryinsky Ballet, and Leningrad was St. Petersburg. Yet, though times have changed, ''La Bayadere'' remains a splendid example of a form of choreography popular a century ago."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"The Pacific Realty Corporation, which earlier this year was rebuffed in a bid for the U.S. Home Corporation, said today that it had formed a joint venture with Trafalgar Holdings Ltd. aimed at increasing its stake in U.S. Home. Pacific, a closely held company based in Dallas, said the new venture intends to buy a significant amount of U.S. Home stock to obtain board representation and influence the management of the company, one of the nation's largest home builders. A U.S. Home spokesman said the company, which had received a copy of the details of the agreement, had not been contacted by either party."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Bradley O'Leary, a devout Republican, and Victor Kamber, a staunch Democrat, are publishers of the Washington-based political dope sheet called the O'Leary/Kamber Report. They admit they don't agree on much of anything, at least as far as politics is concerned."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"On the day last week when indoor soccer's New York Express sent Coach Ray Klivecka packing after an 0-10 start, Rick Davis's mind drifted back to similarly frustrating yet happier times."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Speaking softly and slowly, apparently still nursing his wounded pride after the latest setback in his plan to become President, Leonel Brizola was hardly recognizable as the Socialist firebrand who for a quarter of a century has been the politician most feared by Brazil's ruling elites. Twice this year he gambled his prestige and twice he lost. First he attacked a Government-ordered price freeze that proved to be enormously popular. And then, last month, he converted the election to pick his successor as Governor of Rio de Janeiro into a referendum on President Jose Sarney - and his handpicked candidate was trounced."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Treasury bill rates climbed and bond prices plunged yesterday in a somewhat unsettled and thin money market. Some dealers attributed the selling mainly to a fumbled effort by the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity into the banking system. Others cited the decline in the dollar and the rise in oil prices, along with various other factors. Whatever touched off the decline, the bellwether long bond, the 7.5 percent issue due in 2016, traded late in the day at an offered price of 100 26/ 32, down 1 7/32, and now yields 7.43 percent, compared with 7.36 percent at last Friday's close."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Tom Blackaller's USA was beaten again today in the America's Cup challengers' semifinals, losing to Dennis Conner's Stars & Stripes by 3 minutes 2 seconds. Conner's winning margin was far greater than that on Sunday, when he beat Blackaller by only 10 seconds. It appears that Stars & Stripes may have picked up a speed advantage when new wings were attached to her keel after the end of the round-robin racing earlier this month. The opposite may be true for French Kiss, a boat that was outfitted with a new keel and had 30 inches trimmed from her stern. She lost to New Zealand today by 2:40 after being defeated the previous day by 2:46. Winds were moderate today, at 15 to 19 knots."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"The Weill Recital Hall, the space east of the main auditorium at Carnegie Hall formerly known as Carnegie Recital Hall, will open next Monday at 12:30 P.M. with a song recital by the baritone William Parker and the pianist William Huckaby. The program is the first in an expanded schedule of Carnegie-sponsored concerts in the smaller space, which will continue as well in its long-established role as a rental hall for debut artists and other visitors. For the opening week, concerts have been scheduled at a density of three a day, a circumstance that ordinarily arises only on heavy debut weekends. After Mr. Parker's recital of American music, Toby Hoffman and Liba Shacht - two string players associated with Affiliate Artists - will give an ''informance'' at 3 P.M., with music by Bach, Handel, Mozart and Paganini. ''Informance'' means an informal performance with conversation and questions."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Entries for the 111th annual show of the Westminster Kennel Club at Madison Square Garden on Feb. 9 and 10 have closed with 2,640 dogs representing 139 breeds or varieties. It was the earliest closing in more than a decade. Poodles lead with 130 dogs, followed by golden retrievers with 86, Rottweilers with 68, Akitas with 60 and dachshunds with 57."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Japan crossed a politically critical threshold today, abandoning a 10-year-old policy that had limited military spending to 1 percent of the gross national product. Government leaders agred in a late night meeting to a 1987 military budget of $22 billion, equivalent to 1.004 percent of the projected G.N.P. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's Cabinet is expected to ratify the agreement. The National Security Council was scheduled to discuss a possible new definition for restraining military outlays. The decision, which had been encouraged by Mr. Nakasone, was welcomed by the United States and was attacked by opposition parties as potentially dangerous. The opposition, led by the Socialist Party, has long said that the 1 percent ceiling keeps Japan from ever again becoming a military power."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"A survey of city government officials made public today found that more than a third of those polled believed they could not maintain current services without raising taxes. Thirty-six percent of officials surveyed in 396 cities and towns by the National League of Cities said that without higher taxes, they could not maintain services in the coming year. Fewer than half, 47 percent, said they would be able to maintain existing services at current tax levels."

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Authorities in the Punjab moved today to minimize the effects of a two-day general strike by Sikh militants, rounding up more than 500 people for what was termed preventive detention. Nonetheless, the first day of the largely peaceful strike forced the closing of businesses and offices around the northern state and crippled road and rail traffic."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Workers at the Hanford nuclear reservation today investigated a device believed to have caused a malfunction that triggered an automatic shutdown of the trouble-plagued N reactor, a spokesman said. The aging reactor is scheduled to be shut down for six months Jan. 7 for $50 million in safety modifications recommended by a six-member independent panel. The N reactor, the only United States facility similar in design to the Soviet Union's crippled Chernobyl reactor, was shut down Sunday night when a water-flow monitor gave a false reading, said Rudy Cortez, a spokesman for UNC Nuclear Industries."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Fifty emigres, disappointed with their attempts to build new lives in the United States, returned to the Soviet Union today to a warm official reception. Soviet officials said it was the largest group to be repatriated under the new policy of the Gorbachev administration to allow emigres to return. On arrival by an Aeroflot flight from New York, the returnees, some of them Jews, said at Sheremyetevo Airport that they had been driven back by the stress of urban life in the United States and by the difficulty of fitting into American society. Some mentioned street crime, social ostracism or the lack of guaranteed jobs as factors. Others spoke more fondly of their lives in the United States, but said they had begun to miss the Soviet Union and their relatives."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"New Year's Eve revelers who drink too much in northern New Jersey bars can ride home in a taxi at a brewing company's expense. On Long Island, some people will toast 1987 with ''mocktails,'' concoctions that look like mixed drinks but contain no alcohol. Later they will wait for a Gus Bus. And in some communities in upstate New York, inebriated residents will be sent home in limousines hired with fines collected from motorists convicted of driving while intoxicated."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Pennsylvania Turnpike officials were restocking toll booths across the state today with new tickets that reflect a 30 percent fare increase, the first increase in eight years. The action will raise toll charges from an estimated 2.4 cents per mile to 3.1 cents, and increase minimum charges between interchanges, now 30 cents, by a dime."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Wall Street yesterday recorded its sharpest drop in nearly six weeks as trading volume remained unusually low. Both big and small investors, with the end of 1986 just ahead, seemed uninterested in buying any more stock. Some, worried about the expensive impact of tax law changes that go into effect on Thursday, appeared to be unloading stocks to take capital gains this year. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had risen last week almost solely on a 12-point rise in Merck & Company, one of its 30 components, retreated 18.28 points yesterday, to 1,912.12. Merck, on profit taking, fell 4, to 125."

AMONG the many scientists and doctors whose names adorn the pages of ''False Prophets,'' I have found myself haunted by three in particular: Johnson S. Caulder, Ph.D., Lawrence D. Bergmann, M.D., and Myron C. Filstein, M.D. All three are thanked at the end of a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1981 - Caulder ''for performing the amino acid analyses,'' Bergmann ''for obtaining the heart tissue during pacemaker placement,'' Filstein ''for referring several family members'' - and they sound a solid enough trio. The only trouble is that none of them actually exist; they were being invoked to prop up a series of findings which were themselves in all probability fictitious."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Several American Jewish spokesmen said yesterday that even at this late date, John Cardinal O'Connor should cancel a trip to Israel rather than risk snubbing Israeli leaders by refusing to meet with them officially in Jerusalem. It was the third day in a row that American Jewish groups criticized the agenda for the trip, which was changed at the insistence of the Vatican so it would not appear to be formally recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The Cardinal, who is Archbishop of New York, is in Jordan and plans to go to Israel on Thursday."

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"The Department of Transportation's proposal to allow more flexibility in its air bag rule for cars may spur more widespread use of passenger safety devices by automobile makers but it could also damage efforts to get states to adopt mandatory seat belt use laws, some safety groups and advocates fear. Federal officials disagree with the fears on seat belt laws. The agency is considering scaling back its requirement that automobile makers install automatic restraints for both front seats by the model year 1990. Under its new proposal, the agency would allow a manual belt on the passenger side until about 1994, if an auto maker installed an automatic air bag on the drivers' side only, In response to the proposed air bag change, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation announced this month that they would collectively install close to 2 million air bags by model year 1990 if the rule change was ultimately adopted."

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"The Defense Department today asked Congress for funds to speed research on an immense new space vehicle that the Pentagon says will be needed to lift heavy objects into orbit for the ''Star Wars'' missile defense program. The new program, on which $110 million would be spent for research in the next several months, was introduced as part of a request for $2.8 billion beyond what Congress provided for the military in the current fiscal year. Major new programs are rarely begun through such a supplemental budget request, and some budget analysts said that in the current political and fiscal climate the new funds might be denied. Extra $500 Million for 'Star Wars' The project to develop space-oriented defenses against nuclear missiles, formally called the Strategic Defense Initiative, would account for $500 million of the additional budget request. The request is designed to restore some funds that were cut by Congress when it passed a $289.2 billion military spending bill for the fiscal year 1987, which began Oct. 1."

He was 54 years old. Mr. Tarkovsky and his wife, Larisa, had made their home in Western Europe since July 1984, when, during the shooting in Italy of a film about a man's detachment from his own country, he resolved not to return to the Soviet Union. He said at the time that ''the Soviet authorities left me no other choice.'' Noting that he had been allowed to make only six films in nearly a quarter of a century, he concluded that the Soviet authorities considered him ''a dead soul, a zero.''"

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: First, thank you for your editorial praise, on Dec. 12, of the Senate Republican plan for preventing a $2.4 billion windfall in New York State taxes as a result of Federal tax reform and reducing taxes by an additional $2.1 billion on a phased-in timetable. The $4.5 billion plan, which you described as ''elegantly simple,'' is the result of months of painstaking craftsmanship by State Senators John J. Marchi and Roy M. Goodman and their professional staffs, and it is most gratifying that the work is appreciated. However, I regret very much that you went on to say that the Legislature should now adopt Governor Cuomo's proposal, which he said was intended to return all of the windfall to the taxpayers. But it doesn't even do that - it would return only $1.7 billion of the windfall while retaining the rest for some as yet unexplained purpose."

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"The grisly racial attack on three black men in Howard Beach inflamed race relations in New York City. The temperature shot up yesterday when a judge dismissed murder, manslaughter and assault charges against the three defendants, leaving only charges of reckless endangerment. To call what happened in Howard Beach reckless endangerment would mock justice, yet this reduction is not the work of a racist judicial system. It results from the refusal of two key witnesses, the surviving black victims of a white mob, to cooperate with the police and prosecutors. They and their attorney now must bear a heavy share of responsibility for the reverberating tensions."

In October, United States immigration authorities barred Miss Lara from entering the country but gave no reason. Her visa, which was issued in Paris in 1985, was revoked and she was held in detention for five days, then deported to Colombia. A month later, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Elliott Abrams, publicly accused Miss Lara of being ''a member of the M-19 terrorist organization in Colombia'' and of being ''an active liaison between that terrorist organization, which is in the business of murdering people, and the Cuban secret police.'' He added that Miss Lara had ''been a member of some of the sort of ruling committees'' of the M-19."

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I was disappointed to see the Dec. 8 report of National Cancer Institute conclusions on the upswing of breast-cancer deaths in younger women. It is also disturbing that breast-cancer mortality figures have not changed much for the last half-century. If these statistics are true, then it further emphasizes the need for the use of reliable screening methods, such as mammographic screening, proper breast self-examination and correct physical examination."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"SOFTWARE marketing has attained the stage reached by old cars in '58. Not only are the packaging and the advertising full of fins and flash, but there's an option available for virtually everything and everyone except lefties. As with the cars, however, many of the options in software serve little purpose and are rarely utilized. This lack of real function explains why those once touted integrated packages encompassing everything but the kitchen sink did not sweep the world of personal computing as expected. Consider spreadsheets, for instance. Most spreadsheet users spend the majority of their time massaging numbers. On the whole, their need for a communications package or a database manager is not great. When they do require a different program, chances are that they will simply transfer any data it demands from the spreadsheet to whatever software they normally use for that other purpose."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"The Reagan Administration announced today that it would propose legislation allowing local school districts to provide parents with federally financed vouchers to pay for remedial education classes of their choice. The proposal was submitted as part of overall legislation to reshape the Federal remedial education program, which is meant primarily to serve poor children. Education Department officials said the plan was a significantly scaled-back version of the Administration's two earlier unsuccessful efforts to introduce parental choice into the $3.9 billion program, which is the department's largest. Under the final version of the Administration's bill, localities could choose to offer vouchers, or ''compensatory education certificates,'' if they believe this method would best serve the needs of educationally deprived children. But states could mandate a voucher plan in school districts whose remedial programs are found to be ineffective."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Gen. John Chain, head of the Strategic Air Command, stirs a passionate controversy with his proposal to base MX missiles on rail cars instead of in silos. His plan goes to the heart of a long-disputed issue - how to protect America's silo-based missiles from increasingly accurate Soviet missiles. Are mobile missiles the best way? No, says a group of Pentagon experts. Their solution is to stick with missiles in silos and add antimissile defenses. This plan would convert the Strategic Defense Initiative from Mr. Reagan's dubious goal of protecting the whole country to the easier task of defending missile fields."

The loss estimate is $340 million more than the estimate made a year ago. The latest estimate, while quite provisional, indicates that the F.D.I.C. - and the Federal Government - will suffer a larger loss than originally expected in bailing out Continental, which was the nation's sixth-largest bank before it nearly collapsed in 1984. Effect on Original Shares Today's announcement also increases the chances that the value of Continental's original shares will be wiped out under a provision of the rescue plan that takes effect if the F.D.I.C. loses more than $800 million on the loan portfolio as of September 1989."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Hunters here used to shoot bald eagles for a $2-a-head bounty, and there was anger four years ago when the state carved an eagle sanctuary out of logging and mining land. But today, with the timber mills closed and the mining industry marginal, the town is looking on the birds more favorably. ''When the mills started going down, we started casting around looking for things to help the economy, and the eagles are it,'' says Dianne Halliwill, the local chapter president of the town's new entrepreneurial hope: the American Bald Eagle Foundation. Civic leaders dreamed it up five years ago with a plan to raise $2 million for research in the mountain-rimmed ''valley of the eagles,'' where 1,800 people share the Chilkat River banks with an annual congregation of up to 4,000 bald eagles."

At the moment, the story is being performed as a hit musical in London and will open in New York in March. Between its first publication and its appearance as a hit musical, ''Les Miserables'' has appeared as theatrical production and, several times, as film. Today New Yorkers have a rare opportunity to see a vintage ''Les Miserables'' movie, at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, as part of the museum's homage to the Cinematheque Francaise. The film was made by France's Henri Fescourt in 1925 and is about six hours long. At the museum, Part I will be screened at 3 P.M., Part II at 7 P.M.

One piece, describing the strength of Hercules, brought forth some startling squawks; brass of old is still subject to some mishaps in handling. But both here and in a nicely varied set of six canzonas by Lappi, Gabrieli, Merulo and Priuli, the playing was spirited and alive to the dancing lines of the music."

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"It wasn't quite a matter of loose lips sinking ships, but something Lou Piniella said last week may have poked a small hole in the baseball owners' defense against charges of collusion on the free-agent front. ''Once Texas decided they weren't interested in re-signing him, we decided he was the free agent we really wanted,'' the manager said on the day the Yankees announced the signing of Gary Ward, a 33-year-old outfielder who had spent the last three seasons with the Rangers. The notion that the Yankees had waited for Texas to pass on Ward ''illustrates what's really going on'' among owners, says Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association. The union has charged in a grievance that the owners have violated the collective-bargaining agreement by conspiring not to pursue players who become free agents until their previous teams are no longer interested. Piniella's comment, made Wednesday in an interview with The New York Times, is further proof, says Fehr, who plans to ask Piniella about it."

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"As the Reagan Presidency enters its last two years, the environmental counterrevolution it began in 1981 has achieved only some of its far-reaching goals. Government officials and outside critics interviewed over the past several days agreed that programs to ease the burden of antipollution regulation on business and the economy and of removing obstacles to the rapid development of land and mineral resources by private industry have been only partly successful. These programs, unveiled to heated debate at the outset of the Reagan Administration, have been slowed, and in some cases stopped, in the face of resistance in Congress, the courts and the arena of public opinion. The Administration has made some progress toward its environmental policy aims. Among other things, it has opened broad new off- and onshore lands for oil and mineral leasing, although the leasing itself has been sluggish because of world market conditions. It has slowed the acquisition of new parkland, subjected antipollution rules to rigorous cost-efficiency tests, held up acid rain legislation, cut conservation budgets and, by Presidential veto, blocked an $18 billion renewal of the Clean Water Act."

The officials said the purchase was needed to protect the environmentally sensitive area, part of which lies atop a supply of underground water they said would be needed by Montauk and other surrounding communities in the future."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"South Africa's white authorities announced new measures under the nation's emergency decree today to combat dissent in segregated black schools and to counter plans for an ''alternative'' syllabus called people's education. The action, commentators said, seemed to reflect official concern about plans by anti-Government educators to offer alternative courses in history, English and other subjects as a means of promoting protest against apartheid and to establish what is called people's power. In a separate development, the Government confirmed that it planned to build an airstrip on a remote South African-owned island between Cape Town and Antarctica. But the authorities offered no direct comment on British news reports that the strip was part of a joint Israeli-South African plan to test nuclear weapons."

The 87 bonuses were dispensed at a time when the committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was listing its debts as nearly $2.2 million, part of it offset by cash on hand. Thomas C. Griscom, executive director of the Senatorial Committee, gave himself $50,000, the second largest bonus. Assuming that his annual salary, which is not a matter of public record, is more than $25,100, that means he was paid more than the senators for whose election his organization works."

A steak fry on Sunday night, one of the activities leading up to higher education's version of the Super Bowl, was interrupted when a series of satirical skits performed by Penn State players led to the abrupt departure of the Miami team. The confrontation between the teams, which had been moved back from New Year's Day to Friday night, suddenly came sooner than scheduled. The Penn State skits included a spoof of the Heisman Trophy, which was won by the Miami quarterback, Vinny Testaverde; a reference to the always-in-place hair style of Jimmy Johnson, the Miami coach, and a discussion of Penn State team unity in which John Bruno, a Nittany Lion senior punter, jokingly said that white members of his team allowed black players to eat at the training table once a week."

Mr. Hechinger cites as evidence that from 1970 to 1980, when Federal student aid was increasing rapidly, college costs rose 25 percent slower than the consumer price index. Mr. Hechinger's figures are correct as far as they go, but he overlooks a key point."

But the similar death of Don Rogers a week later appears to have had a stabilizing effect on the Cleveland Browns, whom the Jets will oppose Saturday in the Super Bowl XXI playoffs. ''I think it sobered our team,'' Ernie Accorsi, the Browns' executive vice president, was saying yesterday. ''A year ago our defense did a lot of celebrating on second down, which always seemed premature. And the youngest guy on that defense was Rogers, but he didn't like that.

Mr. Manning, who except for lunch and a break, was on the stand for five hours, said his co-defendant was not at the shooting scene. He said he had left Mr. Williams half an hour earlier at a bar near Netcong, N.J.

The decision came after an influx of orders for the three-engine plane in recent weeks satisfied criteria that the company's board had established for production to begin. McDonnell said it has orders from 12 customers for a total of 52 aircraft, as well as options from those customers on an additional 40 planes.

''No one can spend any time out here without suffering with the Palestinian people,'' the Cardinal told reporters at the end of his visit to the refugee center, Baqaa, outside Amman. Earlier, in a classroom at Baqaa, one of 10 such centers in Jordan, the Cardinal was serenaded by Palestinian boys with short-cropped hair who sang ''Abu Omar Had a Farm'' to the tune of ''Old MacDonald.'' In another classroom, 15-year-old girls, their heads and necks draped modestly in white scarves, answered questions in faltering English about an episode in ''Jane Eyre.''"

She took him to doctors for hormone injections when he was 2 and to Lourdes for the baths, but still Anthony stayed small. Then she heard of an operation being done in Europe that could add a foot of height. She asked a dozen American doctors, but could find none to do it, because they felt it too painful and risky."

The effect of the proposed regulation would be virtually to eliminate all co-insurance under Medicaid for all services provided under Medicare."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"The crisis over arms sales to Iran is described in Middle Eastern terms, but it's really about America. It has very little to do with Iran. That country is pursuing its course more or less as it was doing before the bizarre arms deliveries. The Iranian revolution is savage and gives no indulgence to the gentler parts of human nature. It is a serious chapter in the history of ideas and it is not going to be dethroned or humanized by trivial cloak-and-dagger gestures. But the fact that some officials in Washington believed that the way to win the hearts of ''moderates'' was to send inconsequential packages of arms to an extremist regime tells an ominous story about decision-making in the control tower of the free world."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Mayor Koch yesterday called 1986 ''a terrible year'' for him, and went further than ever before in apologizing for the corruption scandal that has marred the beginning of his third term, the term he had predicted would be his best. Surrounded by newspaper reporters and photographers during his traditional year-end interview, the 62-year-old Mayor conceded, when asked, that he had let down the people of New York. ''I hold myself to the highest standards,'' he said. ''I'm sorry these things happened on my watch. And in that sense I let them down. I didn't meet the standards I set for myself.''"
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"The police said yesterday that a ''failure of communication'' between officers investigating the death of Michael Griffith had caused several hours of confusion over what car killed him after he was chased and beaten in the Howard Beach racial assault. The concession of the procedural error was the latest of several revisions, additions and contradictions that have emerged in official accounts since Dec. 20, when Mr. Griffith, a 23-year-old black man, was struck and killed on the Shore Parkway near 156th Street after being chased by a gang of whites. These inconsistencies have also involved erroneous information about Mr. Griffith's occupation and the name of the company that the police initially said employed him, and differing accounts of why Mr. Griffith and two companions were in Howard Beach at the time of the attacks. Discrepancies Cited Other variations have included differing estimates of the time that elapsed between the departure of two officers from the scene of the first beatings and the beginning of the attack and the police's initial failure to say that the driver of the car that killed Mr. Griffith, Dominick Blum, was not alone when his car struck Mr. Griffith. Other questions, such as why Mr. Griffith was apparently carrying an electronic paging device and who owned a silver-colored cap pistol found near his body, remain unanswered."

''It has been an astonishing performance,'' R. Bryan Jacoboski, international oil analyst for Paine Webber, said admiringly. The stock of the Exxon Corporation, kingpin of the industry, closed yesterday at 72 3/4, down 3/4, after setting a new high last week at 74 1/8. It has been advancing in a steady, but unspectacular, fashion since selling as low as 48 3/8 in February."

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"The Northern Trust Company, Chicago's fourth-largest bank, is the most prominent medium-sized bank in this key market that is not yet part of a larger financial company. But now that it has worked its way out of a morass of bad loans - it was nearly dragged under by the failed Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City in 1983 and by third world lending -Northern Trust is looking so good that it is repeatedly said to be a takeover candidate. ''Management gets high marks for damage control,'' said James J. McDermott, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. ''They identified the problems, resolved them and now have the bank on fine footing for the future growth.'' Evidence of Northern's improvement can be found in many places. It is headed toward record profits this year. It has reduced nonperforming loans to $49.3 million, from a peak $176.7 million in 1983. Its return on equity has risen to 12.5 percent, from 7.6 percent last year.

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Beyond his 70th birthday, the man appears taller and sturdier - if a little grayer - than the one in the pictures that were taken in his youth. Fifty years removed from the basketball revolution he began as a junior at Stanford University, Hank Luisetti was talking about the consistency of his game. ''Basketball has not changed,'' he said. ''The plays haven't changed. Attacking a zone defense in college is the same. Man-for-man, that's always been the same. Nobody's come up with some sure-fire idea. The fundamentals in basketball are still the same. The only change is the jumping. And better shooters.'' Luisetti had overlooked one of the most significant developments in the evolution of the game, of any game: his resourceful means of putting a ball into the basket. He did not modernize basketball single-handedly, just one-handedly. Fifty years ago tonight, long before athletic reputations were made or broken by the presence of television cameras, Luisetti's performance on a New York stage forever altered the structure of the sport."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"CLOCK time is inexorable in its steadiness. But, as the physicists concluded about time in the physical universe, social scientists are now finding that time as a psychological concept is relative - that it is almost totally subjective. Time as experienced in its most profound sense has less to do with the clock than with a mental state or with the psychological realities of life. In this individual orientation to time lie some of the most important elements of personality. Although the coming of the New Year may evoke reflection on the passage of time, few people realize how deeply their orientation toward time shapes their experience."

Yet Walton withheld a vote of confidence from Ryan, despite Ryan's three touchdown, no-interception performance."

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"As workers at Cape Canaveral prepare for the somber task of burying the debris of the space shuttle Challenger in an abandoned missile silo, the greater wreckage of the American space program still lies everywhere, picked over but by no means reassembled into a vibrant whole. Thus, 11 months after the worst disaster in spacefaring history, the United States finds itself well into the space age without a bold vision of where it is going and what it wants to achieve in space and without a coherent, comprehensive national policy guiding its diverse endeavors, according to aerospace experts, members of Congress and space officials. As a consequence, they say, the nation is in danger of forfeiting its position as the leader in space, a loss that could have economic and strategic implications well into the 21st century. The non-military space program, its many triumphs a receding memory, is especially seen as in grave danger. Visions and Realities Once there were manned voyages to the Moon, regular, unmanned departures for the distant planets and a fair wind of shared national commitment that seemed sure to carry those who ventured far beyond the Earth. Once there were dreams of bases on the Moon, humans tramping on the red plains of Mars. The dreams, it once seemed, were so manifestly achievable as to be less like visions than expressions of tomorrow's reality."

It was the third straight Festival championship for St. John's and the Redmen's ninth victory in nine games this season. Georgia Tech is 6-3. 411th for Carnesecca The victory was also the 411th career victory for Lou Carnesecca, the St. John's coach, who passed Clair Bee for 47th place on the career coaching list."

The dismissals for insufficient evidence brought cries of ''injustice'' from some spectators and left only a lesser charge of reckless endangerment against the youths. The words of the youths on the night of the attack, as recounted by police officers who interrogated them, generated shocking testimony in Queens Criminal Court. ''There's some niggers in the pizza parlor - let's go kill them,'' one defendant, Jon L. Lester, purportedly said in recalling how the whites were summoned from a party to the attack. ''They came toward us and we started swinging,'' the youth was quoted as saying."

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"VALUES was the buzz word of education in 1986. Stern demands for the teaching of values came from liberal Democrats like Governor Cuomo as well as conservatives like William J. Bennett, the Secretary of Education. Why? Probably because values seemed in short supply everywhere, from Wall Street to Washington. As usual, the schools were asked to undo society's failure. But they got little help in defining the values they were expected to teach. Threats to the nation's economic competitiveness also raised demands for a response from the schools, particularly for better science teaching. Ironically, at the same time fundamentalists sought to elevate creationism to a science and to give it equal time with the teaching of evolution. Arguments over ''creation science'' went to the Supreme Court in a suit brought by Louisiana's Attorney General against the state's education authorities. The attorney general was supported by religious fundamentalists and conservative groups; the educators were backed by many scientists and liberals. A decision is expected next year."

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"OF all phenomena that affect the human condition none has perplexed scientists more than the forward march of time, its link to the seemingly relentless tendency toward disorder known as entropy, and to the expansion of the universe. Some of the world's leading theorists have speculated that, if the current expansion reverses itself and the universe begins to contract, the arrow of time will change direction. People - if there are any - would live from the grave to the cradle and would ''remember'' what is to happen tomorrow. Some of them have suggested that those living in such a universe would not be aware that time was running backward, because their perception of time would be reversed. But they would live in a universe whose future, in every detail, is predetermined. Scientists have also suggested that our universe might have a twin, formed of antimatter, in which time runs backward."

After a campaign with no speeches, no public promises and no vision of the fund's future, the prize went to Michel Camdessus, governor of the Bank of France. By all accounts he is well qualified as financier, civil servant and diplomat. He will need all of those talents."

An estimated one out of five households bought the question-and-answer game, which racked up nearly $800 million in sales. But while Trivial Pursuit showed how a new board game could capture America's fancy and raised industry expectations of how much money there was to be made, it is proving a hard act to follow. No single new game has had the success of Trivial Pursuit, and sales for the entire adult board game category have fallen off substantially from their $777 million crest, reached in 1984, when Trivial Pursuit was at its height. Last year, sales fell to $304 million, and this year is expected to be about the same."

Wallich, who has resigned from the Federal Reserve Board because of poor health, has always been a generous mentor of young economics professionals, as well as an original thinker and distinguished international financial diplomat. His main historical role, however, is to have been in the forefront of those who warned of the dangers of inflation."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Michael Schler had just put a large brown felt animal on top of his head and was peering into a mirror to see whether or not he looked sufficiently like a gopher. ''I think it used to be a dog, but I'm going to give him a bow tie and a hat and call him Mr. Gopher,'' he explained cheerfully. Mr. Schler, who had had a good day shopping, was also holding a frog head, a tree costume with curly green plastic leaves (''I could put more vines on it,'' he mused), a crown encrusted with paste pearls and rubies and a star-studded purple cape. The loot would eventually represent a day's work for Mr. Schler, a costume designer who was rummaging through the Theater Development Fund's Costume Collection. On this particular occasion, he was putting together costumes for a play about bad children's theater, and his needs encompassed the requisite princess and fairy godmother as well as Mr. Gopher and a frog who turns into a prince."

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Reaction among blacks to the dismissal of murder and manslaughter charges in the Howard Beach racial attack ranged from disappointment to the assertion that it was ''predictable'' in a criminal-justice system that they said has often failed to heed cries by blacks for justice. ''But all is not lost,'' said the counsel for the state conference of local chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Laura Blackburne. ''There is still the possibility that the more serious charges could be restored in the grand jury investigation of the incident.'' The decision, by Judge Ernest Bianchi in Criminal Court in Queens, also prompted many of the black leaders active in public protests of the incident to renew their call for a special prosecutor in the case."

The Nets may miss Dawkins, but you couldn't prove it by the play of his replacements in the last two games. Tonight, as the Nets beat the Milwaukee Bucks, 122-117, Mike Gminski scored 27 points and pulled down 17 rebounds, season highs in each category for the 6-foot-11-inch pivotman.

North told him that the idea of diverting proceeds from the Iran arms sale to Nicaraguan rebels came from a senior Israeli official, according to Congressional sources. The Congressional account of Mr. Meese's testimony was confirmed today by a Justice Department official. The official said the department had been unable to corroborate Mr. North's reported assertion. The Israeli Government has repeatedly and emphatically denied any connection to the diversion of money to the Nicaraguan rebels or knowledge that such an operation had taken place. According to the Congressional sources, Mr. Meese said in a closed committee hearing that Colonel North had described the purported Israeli role when he was questioned by Mr. Meese on Nov. 23."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Fog at Atlanta's busy airport disrupted nationwide airline operations and delayed thousands of homeward-bound Christmas travelers for the second day yesterday. But the inconvenience was modest contrasted with the snarl Sunday when Delta Air Lines, a major operator in Atlanta, reported average flight delays there of more two hours and some of more than four hours. In all, 70,000 passengers across the country were estimated to have been delayed Sunday by the problems in Atlanta. Coast to coast, the total number of airline delays Sunday was 1,174, the Federal Aviation Administration reported. This did not approach a record. But because the planes were full of passengers, and Atlanta is a major hub for flight connections, the effect was much greater than it would otherwise have been."

Utilities abandoning nuclear plants still under construction must also take charges, the rule-making body determined. Until now, utilities could spread out the impact of such costs over time. But many companies, such as the Long Island Lighting Company, did take charges, believing that they were inevitable."

The salesman, Lani Evans, 53 years old, destroyed furniture, telephones and computer terminals in the office, and he ripped up records about his employment, according to Police Lieut. Robert Cividanes. The police closed parts of Third Avenue and 56th Street for most of the working day, snarling traffic in the area. They evacuated some apartments across the street from the company's office because the residents were in the potential line of fire."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"The Comptroller of the Currency has begun to approve applications by several major New York City banking companies to set up operations in the District of Columbia that could give the institutions broad new securities powers in addition to full banking powers. An agency spokesman said today that the Comptroller, Robert Clarke, last Wednesday had quietly approved an application by J.P. Morgan & Company to establish the Morgan Bank D.C. Through that new institution, set up under a now-closed loophole in the District's banking law, Morgan would be able to enter a full range of underwriting activities, such as the issuing of commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, government revenue bonds and corporate equity and debt securities. Full Banking Activities The Morgan Bank D.C. would at the same time be able to conduct full banking activities, such as deposit taking and the making of commercial loans. Such a development could be a blow to the existence of the longstanding law that separates commercial banks from securities firms. However, Morgan's new banking operations still require approval by the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates bank holding companies. And some experts expect that the Fed will try to block the securities activities."

1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"Leaders everywhere are wringing their hands about the loss of United States credibility after the Iran-contra affair. But the problem may be even more in the wild ideas people are prepared to believe when they can't be sure than in loss of trust in the word of the U.S. Government. Credulity has always been a corrosive element in affairs between nations, especially in the Middle East where there are often some grounds to enhance the temptation of conspiracy theories. The corrective has to be a demand for evidence, stubborn insistence on common sense short of proof to the contrary."
1986-12-30T00:00:00Z,"John Mockovciak Jr., an aerospace engineer with the Grumman Corporation, faces the pleasant prospect next spring of moving from Bayville, L.I., to Houston. He will probably be able to sell his 2,000-square-foot ranch house on Long Island for at least $350,000 and buy something similar here for less than half that. And when the Mockovciaks arrive in Texas they will find almost everything else bargain-basement cheap too: fuel, utilities, parking, insurance, taxis, restaurant meals, air fares, taxes. It costs only about 62 cents a gallon for regular unleaded gasoline here, compared with $1.03 in Manhattan and about 85 cents on Long Island.

Blanchard of Michigan signed a bill into law last week creating a statewide tuition-guarantee program, Michigan became the first state to adopt an idea that more than a dozen private colleges are already using to help parents cope with the crunch of college expenses. Under the Michigan law, which Mr. Blanchard proposed in January, the state guarantees a child's tuition at any public college or university in the state if parents deposit as little as $3,000 in a new state-sponsored trust fund. How much they will be required to deposit to qualify will depend on the age of the child, with infants' parents paying the least and teen-agers' parents paying the most because they will go to college sooner. The program covers the University of Michigan and 14 other four-year state colleges, as well as 29 two-year schools."

Hadis Morkoc, who led the engineers who designed the transistor, said the device should allow more information to be transmitted to and from satellites and should allow reception of very low-level radio signals. The transistor was fabricated and tested for performance at the General Electric laboratory in Syracuse, N.Y. More testing, which could take one to two years, will seek to establish the transistor's endurance."

Mr. Burr was long regarded as the champion of the economy-minded traveler and as the founder of a new management system where workers were also managers. In the past, he had conceded making major errors, such as too-rapid expansion, and yesterday his mood was subdued."

It is possible, however, that these findings are related to increased stress, which has been shown in both laboratory animals and humans to increase the incidence and rate of growth of breast cancer. It has now been clearly documented that emotional stress is associated with a decline in immune-system parameters responsible for defenses against cancer. Inability to express anger, frustration, loss of important emotional relationships and social isolation have been particularly incriminated, especially for breast malignancies."

Those decisions, they said, could determine whether criminal charges, and what charges in particular, would be presented to a grand jury. What happens now, the experts said, depends on what the prosecutors do and on the two surviving victims, who have refused to cooperate. Politically Loaded Options For the district attorney's office, the options, like the case itself, are sensitive and politically loaded: The prosecutor could force the victims to testify under court order, could bring the case before a grand jury without the victims' testimony or could grant immunity to certain participants in the crime in return for their testimony."

So did the feeling for luxury and opulence this past fall, reflected in the preference for cashmere in daytime clothes and glitter and lavishness for evening. Whatever the reasons, designers of expensive clothes report that their lists of best-selling clothes for spring are studded with extravagant designs. The more exaggerated clothes have, in many cases, outshone the modified versions of the same design ideas. Women seem to be in a festive mood, designers assert, especially when they are thinking about getting dressed up at night."

Earlier, a State Department spokesman had said there was ''no link whatsoever'' between the anticipated return of the $500 million and the possible release of the five Americans believed still held hostage in Lebanon. But the department's legal adviser said later this afternoon that the United States hoped that resolution of this case would persuade Iran to help free the hostages.

Mr. Lipton said that those courts had failed to understand the dynamics of takeover battles - and ended up favoring raiders and hurting shareholders - when they ruled that corporate boards should not have sided with efforts of management to put together leveraged buyouts to thwart hostile bidders. In his letter, Mr. Lipton joined a heated debate in which many lawyers and judges say the courts should closely scrutinize management buyouts because management's interests in such situations can conflict with those of shareholders. In the cases that Mr. Lipton criticized, corporate boards had approved sweeteners - such as ''lock-up'' options to buy precious corporate assets -that helped induce investment firms to join management in making a defensive leveraged buyout bid for the company. However, the courts ruled that the boards were wrong to grant such sweeteners because they deterred higher bids, rather than encouraging them. Thus, the courts said, the boards failed to fulfill their primary duty: getting the maximum value for shareholders."

Mr. Lepkowski is wrong on two counts. First, in passing meaningful tort reform, New York took an important step toward restoring fairness to the civil justice system. In addition to other significant reforms, the New York Legislature limited liability for those with only minor responsibility for someone else's harm. Previously, a defendant in a New York lawsuit could be held responsible for all of a plaintiff's damages even if that defendant were responsible for only 1 percent of those damages. Opinion polls and a statewide referendum in California clearly show that the public favors this change in the law."
1986-12-31T00:00:00Z,"MOST of us in the music business look back on one or more mentor-figures who inspired us in youth with their dedication, intensity and commitment. Alexander Schneider has played that part in the lives of hundreds of young musicians, and his example as a leader and educator endears him even to those observers who receive his example as a musician with mixed feelings. Mr. Schneider gave the second concert of his annual New York String Orchestra workshop Monday evening in Carnegie Hall, leading 50 young string players (and 12 players on other instruments) from all over the country. His musical approach is best understood, probably, in the context of Stravinsky's ''Pulcinella,'' which (in the form of the familiar concert suite) closed his Carnegie program. Mr. Schneider (who worked with Stravinsky and played his music brilliantly) seems drawn to Baroque and Classical music for its tense energy of line, and for the latent violence in its disciplined, ordered contrasts. Stravinsky's dancing arrangement of Italian Baroque music lets those qualities peek in; Mr. Schneider's conducting of Mozart, Haydn and Vivaldi goads them forward. In the ''Pulcinella Suite,'' the match was good. The abrupt, dry pizzicato in the ''Serenata,'' the bright-light rush into the ''Scherzino''; interpretive details like these seemed related to the needs of the music."

Still, I have cooked and served them to guests who subsequently revised their opinions of the dish. This is, I feel, a tribute to the technique I used in preparing the chicken livers. They should be coated with flour and cooked until they are deliciously browned and crisp. Once this is done, I add a special flavor by using a low-calorie accompaniment - sauteed onions plus capers and a slightly sweet-and-sour sauce made from a little red-wine vinegar and a dash of honey."

Literally hundreds of sparkling wines are made around the world - about 60 in California alone - and champagne is just one of them. In this part of the world we tend to think of champagne as the best of the lot. Even if we're right, we owe it to ourselves to discover a few of the other wines that are out there. They range from sticky-sweet California concoctions such as cold duck to the delights of an elegant Schramsberg Napa Valley blanc de blancs; from sulfurous brews such as the Soviet Union's Krim, which someone once described as an unpleasant lambrusco, to the delightful Vouvrays of Marc Bredif and the new cremants from Alsace. True Champagne, made in the region of the same name, probably constitutes less than 2 percent of the world's sparkling wine; there is even a pretty good one made in Peru. We tend to get confused because so many other sparkling wines are called champagne, the way much of the blended red wine in California is called burgundy."

Not even swimming may beckon when it means stepping out into a cold, dark morning or night. Yet in several ways winter is the most important time to maintain an exercise routine. It is often a time of unwanted expansion - thicker waists, heftier thighs, rounder bellies. Appetites are naturally stimulated by the cold. Since eating and digesting food generate body heat, we often turn to food when we feel cold. The resulting layers of added body fat, so helpful to hibernating and foraging animals like squirrels, make us feel sluggish and less likely to want to exercise. Then there are those New Year's resolutions to start an exercise program. The latest national surveys show that, despite the explosive growth in sales of exercise clothing and equipment, 60 percent of Americans get no regular exercise. When people do exercise, too often it is the result of guilt rather than desire. Without a realistic understanding of what exercise can do for you, resolve tends to fade with the first gust of wintry wind."

The official, He Dongchang, who is Deputy Chairman of the Education Commission, took a moderate posture in responding to questions about the demonstrations. ''The Chinese Government position toward the students is one of tolerance,'' he said.

1986-12-31T00:00:00Z,"For a year that began with the Challenger shuttle disaster and ended in a muddle about Iran, hostages and contras, television has not come up with much that is new or especially appropriate in the way of New Year's Eve farewells. Although one station, WOR-TV, is doing something innovative by getting the Marx Brothers into the end-of-year act, elsewhere it is entertainment as usual. Beginning at 11:30 P.M., CBS will be broadcasting part of its festivities from New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, long associated with Guy Lombardo and after his death with the Lombardo Orchestra. But there will be no Lombardo imprint on this year's ''Auld Lang Syne.'' The hosts of the Waldorf section of the show are Gladys Knight and the Pips, and there will be periodic breakaways to Air Supply, Melba Moore and Freddie Jackson at Walt Disney World in Florida. There will also be, of course, live coverage of the midnight countdown at Times Square."

The most recent rough guess for Connecticut is 20,000, according to the emergency coordinator for that state's Department of Human Resources, Judy Walter. A report issued this year by Governor Kean's task force on the homeless puts the figure in New Jersey at 26,000. On Long Island, there are believed to be more than 12,000 homeless people, while in Westchester the number of homeless is generally thought to be around 3,500, up more than 65 percent in the past year alone, according to the county's Social Services Commissioner, John J.

1986-12-31T00:00:00Z,"The highly publicized departure of American companies from South Africa is having a far more ambiguous effect than advocates of such divestment might have hoped for. These advocates, mostly in the United States, have urged that American companies shun South Africa as a message that South Africa's racist way of life is no longer tolerable and that refusal to change would bring increasing economic isolation. But in the short run, at least, the impact of American companies leaving South Africa seems to run counter to the aim of forcing the country's ruling white minority to moderate its political attitudes. Moreover, midway through a wave of departures by American enterprises, business analysts and others are concluding that the withdrawals are only partial, permitting the companies to continue earning profits in South Africa. By selling their businesses to local buyers, American companies are maintaining licensing arrangements and contracts to supply components and thereby earning money without the political hazards of direct investment."
1986-12-31T00:00:00Z,"The Swiss authorities said today that they would take further steps early in the new year to freeze accounts controlled by Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North and others involved in the covert arms sales to Iran. They said they would simultaneously lift banking secrecy regulations covering the accounts. Officials said these measures would set in motion procedures under which legal objections could be filed against the action, possibly blocking temporarily an investigation of account records. Study of the records is crucial to United States Justice Department investigators to determine whether proceeds from the arm sales were funneled to Nicaraguan rebels, and if so, how much."

The positive views of analysts on Owens-Cornings, based in Toledo, Ohio, are not reflective as much of the economic factors now aiding the building products industry - notably lower interest rates and improvements in housing starts - as they are of the recapitalization program the company took on to fight a hostile tender offer by the Wickes Companies in August. In warding off Wickes, Owens-Corning assumed an additional $1.5 billion in debt from nine banks to finance its recapitalization, raising its total debt to a huge $2.5 billion. But at the same time, the company announced plans to sell assets - including the aerospace unit it bought for $415 million from Armco Inc. last year - and to sharply reduce its work force of 28,000 employees by 13,000."

Is No Blessing'' (Nov. 9), the writer eloquently depicts the plight of the small private-property owner burdened by a wetlands designation. Severe use restrictions, imposed pursuant to the police powers of the state, placed on even small parcels of highly valuable Staten Island real estate result in significant economic loss. Moreover, to contest a designation, property owners must hire a biologist or environmentalist and an attorney - a considerable expense, with no guarantee of defeating the designation."

At the same time, he criticized the handling of the case by the Queens District Attorney, John J. Santucci. And at a City Hall news conference yesterday, Mayor Koch and Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward sharply criticized one of the attorneys, Alton H. Maddox Jr., calling on him to have his client cooperate with law-enforcement authorities without setting conditions. Mr. Ward also implied that Mr. Maddox might be motivated, in part, by the money he might make from a wrongful-death lawsuit. Main Counts Dismissed Mr. Maddox, the attorney for Cedric Sandiford, the key witness in the case, and C.

1986-12-31T00:00:00Z,"In the waning moments of the old year, some thoughts, some impressions, some misplaced notes surface. When Bill Veeck, one of our most charismatic sports figures, died early in the year, on Jan. 2, his friend Hank Greenberg recalled a moment in his life: ''It was between marriages for Bill, and he fell in love with a young woman when both were in Los Angeles. She was taking a train back to New York, and Bill arranged that at every stop of the train - and there were many over 3,000 miles - she would be presented with a bouquet of roses.''

He said the policy change had been made reluctantly to help Japan keep pace with its military needs.

1986-12-31T00:00:00Z,"WHETHER New Year's Day is celebrated on Jan. 1 according to the Gregorian calendar, in September or October as the Jews' Rosh ha-Shanah or in midwinter by Asians, foods serve as edible talismans to assure luck, happiness or prosperity in the coming year. The notion, for example, that eating gold-colored food will put money in your pocket is common in Peru, where papas a la huancaina, a potato dish tinted with tumeric or with a saffron-colored spice called tadillo, is served on New Year's Eve. In China, dumplings made from golden egg pancakes, crisply gilded spring rolls and oranges are the aureate foods appropriate for the Chinese New Year's celebrations in midwinter. The Chinese also value fish. A whole one is preferred, suggesting that prosperity has favored you with more than you can eat."

What of the Night?'' and ''The Dicky Bird and the Owl.'' And about an hour before the New Year is rung in, the appetites of 300 of these fortunates will be sated with such savories as Victorian bisquits and Chatterly cheese rounds, and with sweets such as lemon curd in pastry cups, Yorkshire fat rascals and Richmond maids of honor. The gala, billed as ''An Evening of Victorian Songs and Music,'' begins in Carnegie Hall at 8 P.M.

The jaw was stern, the eyes were focused and the overall attitude was bold, almost daring, confidence. Yet the player with those looks was not Bernard King, the Knick forward whose scoring often was as close to unstoppable as one can imagine. It was Gerald Wilkins, and the results were just as thrilling. The second-year guard, who has devoloped into the Knicks' most exciting player, led the team to its most exciting victory of the season last night by scoring 12 of his 29 points during a furious fourth-quarter rally. It helped erase a 10-point deficit and culminated in a 103-97 triumph over the Washington Bullets."

1986-12-31T00:00:00Z,"Ending a 19-day special session that had set suburban and New York City lawmakers against each other, the State Legislature voted today to finance a rebuilding of the city's mass-transit system and a three-year freeze of its fares. The vote averted the immediate fare increases on the city's subway, bus and commuter rail lines that had been threatened by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The legislation won approval after Democrats, in an effort to appease Republicans from suburban areas, agreed to increased spending for the rebuilding of highways and to direct state aid for commuter rail lines. A Postponed Decision Although the legislation averts immediate fare increases and allows a five-year $8.6 billion M.T.A. capital-construction program to begin on the city's transit system and commuter rail lines, it does not fully resolve the transit matter. After weeks of proposals and counterproposals, the Legislature was unable to agree on how to raise the final $735 million for the program, and the measure puts off until March 15 that politically divisive decision. Governor Cuomo's original proposal, for a nickel-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax, was blocked by suburban Republicans."

1986-12-31T00:00:00Z,"For many Israeli legal scholars, civil rights campaigners and security experts, a police commission's announcement Monday clearing Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of complicity in the 1984 killing of two Palestinian bus hijackers is hardly a reason for national joy. Too many wounds, they say, were inflicted on the Israeli legal system and on the rule of law by Mr. Shamir and other members of the Israeli Cabinet throughout the affair for anyone to celebrate. The only thing happy about the conclusion of the episode, these Israelis say, is that it closes one of the most troubling chapters in Israel's modern history - a chapter involving the deaths of handcuffed captives in the custody of Israeli agents, apparently a cover-up by an intelligence service, presidential pardons without any investigations and a myriad other challenges to the rule of law in Israel. Cloud of Suspicion For Prime Minister Shamir and his defenders, there is no doubt that the occasion was one for celebration. Mr. Shamir was under suspicion of having approved of the beating deaths of the two Palestinian cousins, Subhi and Majid Abu-Jumas, who were captured after hijacking an Israeli bus near Ashkelon in April 1984, and of sanctioning a subsequent effort by the head of Shin Beth, the domestic intelligence service, to cover up of the killings."

Bell Laboratories in New Jersey have achieved sudden and substantial increases. The discovery has vast implications for such diverse fields as electrical transmission and generation, energy storage and the generation of fusion energy. Possible Applications The achievements also mean that superconductivity, in which materials lose all resistance to electricity, can be more widely applied for scientific research and could substantially reduce the cost of the proposed superconducting atom smasher with a 60-mile acceleration ring. If used in electrical lines, according to one of the researchers, the technology could save billions of dollars in energy lost in transmission."

The only thing that Fremantle lacks, so far, is the American tourists. Although outdoor cafes and newly designed malls are bustling with visitors, most conversations are in the Australian idiom, with relatively few Americans or Europeans in the crowds. ''People expected a lot more,'' said Barbara McKeown, manager of the Oasis women's clothing store in Fremantle. ''Before the races started, everybody was saying it was going to skyrocket, and it never did.''"

He had scarcely begun to show off the energy management prowess of the plant's only computer when Mr. Moeller smiled, said ''that's fine'' and strode out. The people at the 30-year-old Bristol plant soon learned why Mr. Moeller (pronounced MIL-ler) was in such a hurry. Less than two months after taking command of manufacturing strategy for Electrolux, he boldly announced plans to close its aging complex in Old Greenwich, Conn., (the company has its headquarters in Stamford) and to transform the Bristol plant into a model of automation and modern manufacturing practices."

The White House said in this desert resort, where Mr. Reagan is spending a vacation, that he would beam a broadcast message to the Soviet people anyway, using the Voice of America. Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said the President hoped the Russians would not jam the planned broadcast on New Year's Day. In Moscow, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennadi I. Gerasimov, said the Soviet Union saw no basis for an exchange of messages in view of what he said was the United States reluctance to adhere to informal arms control agreements reached in Iceland."

The Cardinal's decision, since reversed, to meet the President, the Prime Minister and other senior Government representatives in Jerusalem was termed a ''mistake'' by the senior Vatican official, who said a Vatican diplomat had urged the Cardinal to change his plans."

(I will stop here, lest I precipitate another city scandal, to say that at the time the City Council President was a woman.) We began to chat, and eventually our chat turned to matters of moment, and eventually the matters of moment became newsworthy. I left the bathroom with a story. After years of worrying that the best stories were coming out of conversations in the men's room, I also left with the conviction that journalism was going to be all right for women after all. My mind goes back to that day when I think of what I consider the worst scare tactic employed by people opposed to the proposed equal rights amendment. This was the suggestion that passage of the measure would lead to unisex bathrooms. (Nearly as objectionable was the use of the word ''unisex,'' which should by law be applied only to certain hair salons to let you know that they are the kind of places you want to avoid.) I can assure everyone that if a piece of legislation took away restricted access to the jane - as I prefer to call the female john - I would march in the streets to protest its passage."

The decision, which is likely to increase the prices Americans pay for those and other products, was disclosed as the President and his wife vacationed at the home of the publisher Walter H. Annenberg. The trade action, which had been threatened, followed long negotiations between the United States and the European Community over compensation for high tariffs imposed by the community on American grain-feed imports to Spain, which was once a lucrative market for American corn and sorghum."

The two individuals agreed to give up more than $340,000 in illegal profits, and the lawyer, who neither admitted nor denied the charges, agreed to pay a penalty of more than $228,000. The commission said today that the two cases were not related to its continuing insider-trading inquiry stemming from the Ivan F. Boesky case. Nevertheless, some market experts lamented that the cases provided further evidence that the illegal use of private corporate information by investors is widespread."

''Ultimately,'' the Cardinal said at a brief news conference, ''I can't see how a very severe conflagration can be avoided in the Middle East unless there is an honest and sincere dialogue by all parties about the rights of people in the area.'' The Cardinal, who is on a nine-day visit to the Middle East that has been clouded by a diplomatic controversy over appointments with Israeli leaders, spent more than two hours at the royal palace having lunch with the King."

He castigates the world organization for such faults as administrative and budgetary shortcomings. These and other charges are not without factual basis, although he exaggerates. However, they are being corrected as the U.N. is now serious about reform. Would that the U.S. Congress, of which Senator Trible is a member, were as concerned about improving itself. Bogged down in partisan politics and overlapping committees, it flounders considerably."

Johnson, president of George Mason University, had gone there to watch one of his faculty members receive the economics prize. But, in a larger sense, the prize for the economist, James M. Buchanan, was an honor for Mr. Johnson as well, in that it called worldwide attention to his development of their school. Founded in 1957 in an old high school building in a suburban shopping center, George Mason, with 17 students, was at first affiliated with the University of Virginia. Today it serves 12,300 undergraduates and 5,260 graduate students as a state university on wooded campus of 600 acres in Fairfax, Va."

Under the recommendations, the Federal Government would create a $1 billion trust fund to help acquire and maintain open space."
1986-12-31T00:00:00Z,"By leaping into the production of a new jumbo jet, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation is entering a growth market, but one that may not yield big profits, analysts said yesterday. ''My gut feeling is that they will sell enough airplanes to break even and not much more,'' said Howard Mager, an aerospace analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York. Analysts said the MD-11 aircraft, which got McDonnell's go-ahead on Monday, would be ideal for many airlines - particularly those that fly to international destinations from ''secondary hubs,'' such as Chicago or Dallas, rather than from primary gateways like New York. Improved Efficiency That is because the MD-11, although based on McDonnell Douglas's three-engine DC-10, will be much more fuel-efficient and have a flying range of up to 8,870 miles - an increase of more than 30 percent. It will also carry as many as 405 passengers, compared with a maximum of 380 for the DC-10, and will have an advanced cockpit that will require only a two-man crew, compared with three for the DC-10."

He urged his 400 employees at Mesa Petroleum to cancel their subscriptions to the local newspapers to protest ''negative reporting'' of Amarillo news. A week later an uneasy truce had been called between two of this Panhandle city's most powerful corporate citizens. But the episode served to highlight the often stormy relationship between Mr. Pickens, a shrewd businessman whose efforts to take over other companies have attracted national attention, and his hometown, a city of 150,000 people far from the financial capitals. Adept at the national public relations game, Mr. Pickens has never quite received the same respect from the local press."

The move could significantly broaden the power of the special prosecutor, Lawrence E. Walsh, who has already been given authority to investigate American-sanctioned arms sales to the Iranian Government and the diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels. The other cases involve private citizens and Iranian agents accused of the unauthorized sale of American weapons to Iran. There are more than a dozen such prosecutions around the country, and they are apparently independent of any effort to aid the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras."

The statement from Georgetown University Hospital gave no indication that Mr. Casey's condition had changed since late last week, when the hospital said the same thing in its last report on the patient. And it leaves a number of crucial questions unanswered, including when or whether he will be capable of talking, walking or resuming his duties. White House officials said today that President Reagan had not talked to Mr. Casey since his brain surgery. They did not say why. Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said he did not believe ''it was appropriate at this stage'' to explain if there was a medical reason why Mr. Reagan had spoken with Mr. Casey's wife, Sophia, but not to Mr. Casey. Nancy Reagan, the President's wife, has also spoken with Mrs. Casey. Mr. Speakes, who was with the President in Palm Springs, Calif., said he did not know if Mr. Casey was able to speak."

Mr. Meehan, originally with the Australian Ballet and seen in New York mainly with American Ballet Theater, has partnered the City Ballet's Merrill Ashley in frequent freelance appearances.

The provision, Section 602(a) of the 1976 United States Copyright Act, deals with pirated recordings and ''parallel imports'' (imported versions of works copyrighted in the United States).

In an interview, the chairman, Gorman Gilbert, said that after six months in office, he believes inadequate service by medallion cabs can be traced to past mistakes by his agency and to lack of competition in the industry. He also said that New Yorkers who rely on nonmedallion cabs rather than yellow cabs are receiving more efficient and polite service in cleaner cars. Mr. Gilbert was referring to the estimated 5,000 ''black cars'' that primarily service corporate accounts and 20,000 community car-service vehicles that are mainly found in the boroughs outside Manhattan.

The Fiesta Bowl between Penn State and Miami on Friday night will determine the No. 1 team in the country, but here in the Sun Belt, where the pace is slower and passions burn on a low flame, it cannot hurt to fan emotions whenever possible, drumming up more interest than might already exist. It is called hype and Barnum could not have orchestrated Miami's walkout after a dinner for the two teams Sunday in what is now referred to simply as ''the steak fry incident'' any better than Brown, who claimed that the Hurricanes were miffed by the skits performed by some Penn State players. Came to Play Football No big deal, said Jimmy Johnson, the Miami coach. But then, he added: ''Our players had a skit too. But why carry it out? We said what we came to do, play a football game and go home.''"

Vernon Mason, have been involved in many of the cases that have arisen in recent years that have involved questions of police brutality and racial attacks on blacks. In the Howard Beach case, Mr. Maddox is representing a key witness, Cedric Sandiford, a victim of the attack, and has advised him not to cooperate with the investigation. Mr. Mason is representing another victim, Timothy Grimes, whose testimony is not considered as important to the case.

The following random impressions, some timely, some trivial, are my 1986 journalistic nightcap, which clears the agenda and the palate for another year of gustatory sleuthing. Pyrrhic victory of the year: Le Regence in the Plaza Athenee Hotel (East 64th Street), after garnering a two-star review, lost its chef and two assistants to Le Cirque (East 65th Street). Shortly after, the maitre d'hotel left to join a new venture.

In Billboard's annual chart tabulation of the year's most popular records, Whitney Houston ranked as the No. 1 artist of the year in combined singles and album sales. The tabulation, covering the 12 months that ended in mid-November, also placed Ms. Houston's eponymously titled debut album, which sold seven million copies, as No. 1 for the year. Ranked second was ''Heart,'' the comeback album by the West Coast rock group of the same name. Rounding out the Top 10 in order were John Cougar Mellencamp's ''Scarecrow,'' ZZ Top's ''Afterburner,'' Dire Straits' ''Brothers in Arms,'' Janet Jackson's ''Control,'' Mr. Mister's ''Welcome to the Real World,'' Sade's ''Promise,'' Phil Collins's ''No Jacket Required,'' and Miami Sound Machine's ''Primitive Love.''"

The trip, by Richard W.

''It's important to send the message that we're not dead in the water,'' a senior State Department official said. Phyllis Oakley, a State Department spokesman, said President Reagan, after consultation with Secretary of State George P.

1986-12-31T00:00:00Z,"It's clear by now to most Americans that the White House scandal involved some sort of violation of Congressional restrictions on covert operations. Yet many people seem to forget that these restrictions were part of a careful deal worked out between Congress and the executive branch little more than a decade ago to protect our constitutional system while permitting covert operations. Apparently, this tacit deal was not enough, and it ought to be made more binding now. The intelligence scandals of the 1970's revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency, operating as the secret arm of the White House, had regularly acted in ways that threatened constitutional rights and procedures at home and were inconsistent with American principles abroad. The public and Congress alike were shocked by reports of C.I.A. assassination efforts and of spying on Americans -revelations that made a powerful case for simply prohibiting covert operations."

1986-12-31T00:00:00Z,"WELCOME to the universe of Food-1987, in which the forces of nutrition and convenience will determine the shape of things to come: what consumers buy, what supermarkets sell, what restaurants serve, what manufacturers produce. Periodically these forces will join - a nutritious meal will also be a tasty, quick one. More often, however, the need for convenience in the coming year will outweigh the desire for healthful food on the table. The forecast is gloomy, then, for products and services designed to save money - warehouse supermarkets and generic products (unbranded canned and packaged goods) - since speed of food purchase and preparation will likely override concerns about price. But manufacturers of microwave ovens, merchants of carryout food, fruit and vegetable farmers and ranchers who raise leaner meats should have cause to celebrate. The news is also good for purveyors of ethnic cuisines that rely more on vegetables and grains than on meats. While the future importance of nutrition is unquestionable, the direction nutrition concerns will take is in doubt. Some experts, such as Fabian Linden, executive director of the consumer research center of the Conference Board, a marketing information service, believe that concern is increasing. ''We are continuously creating a more sophisticated species of Americans, and they are taking a more cerebral approach to eating,'' he said."

1987-01-11T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: MIDAIR, by Frank Conroy. (Penguin, $5.95.) This collection of stories by Frank Conroy is as spare as his autobiographical novel, ''Stop-Time,'' was expansive, William H. Pritchard said in these pages in 1985. Some of the tales, he said, are ''dreamlike happenings reminiscent of Franz Kafka or Nathanael West, with perhaps a twist of Philip Roth,'' while others are ''admirable precisely for their realistic textures, the way they provide us with confirmation of common experiences."
1987-01-11T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Barbara Basler's article ''Putting a Career on Hold'' (Dec. 7) causes me grave concern. The women she describes have ''made it to the top'' and yet choose not to juggle the demands of career, marriage and family, even with the supports that their salaries can provide. The attention paid to this minority of women serves to distract attention from the majority of women who have always juggled these demands."

1987-01-11T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: In assembling the list of the best classical recordings released in 1986, I stumbled, all unawares, upon a trend. Critics love trends, just as bird-watchers delight in an especially exotic sighting; they make all that waiting and watching worthwhile."
1987-01-11T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Communities confused or discontent in the present often strongly rediscover the moral and spiritual meaning of the traditional objects of their past. This has usually been associated with so-called ''traditional'' societies - certainly not industrial ones. Recently, however, the inexorable recognition that the technology of the industrial system is not a surefire solution to all life's problems has, in a strange paradox, begun to focus broad and appreciative attention on the old ''classical'' objects of the industrial way."

Despite our best efforts it is probable that, apart from the most immediate, pragmatic, technical revisions, the writer's effort to detach himself from his work is quixotic: knowing too much is a way of knowing too little; or, conversely, how can we expect to know more about ourselves than we know about anything else?"

1987-01-18T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: SOME seasonings are roughly interchangeable. Tarragon can stand in for chervil and, in a pinch so can parsley. Vinegar instead of lemon is another effective substitution as is black pepper for cayenne. But no seasoning does exactly the same job of bringing up flavor as salt.
