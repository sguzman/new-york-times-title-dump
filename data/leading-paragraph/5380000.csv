Aronson and Carl Austin Weiss (April 16), critical of Morton Hunt's Body and Mind article ''Patients' Rights'' (March 5), merely serve to reinforce the extraordinarily cogent points Mr. Hunt was trying to make. To wit, too many doctors nowadays have become haughty, arrogant, too busy to listen, and clutching at the pedestals they themselves have erected on patients' backs."

The gay teen-age boys who populate this short, brutal novel are not entirely indistinguishable from one another, but their energetic couplings betray a fatal sameness that is only occasionally relieved by the homicidal fetishes of their older lovers. Some readers have found similarities between the novelist and art critic Dennis Cooper's work and that of Jean Genet or William Burroughs, but it must be said that he lacks the ordering instincts of the one and the wild comedy of the other."

1989-05-21T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: I don't remember when the idea struck me to write a play about two feuding actresses, legends in their time, who were somewhat over the hill, had made one film together that was a box-office hit but represented personal hell during the making.

1989-05-28T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The graphic violence in the comics discussed by Joe Queenan is of less importance than the violence that exists in comics of even the most mundane, newspaper variety.
