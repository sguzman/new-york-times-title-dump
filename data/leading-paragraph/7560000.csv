2011-11-01T06:37:22Z,"CAIRO - It has been nearly three months since the last really big, unmanageable crowd converged on Tahrir Square and threatened to stay until its demands were met. On the eve of Ramadan, in early August, the Egyptian military smacked and clubbed that group - a broad but woefully inarticulate coalition opposing the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces' hold on power - out of the square. And much to the protesters' horror, the majority of Egyptians seemed fairly satisfied with the pushback, preferring a return to order even if it came with a military policeman's truncheon."

Cincinnati called a play-action pass, but the pocket collapsed on the rookie quarterback Andy Dalton as he began to execute the fake handoff. With multiple Seahawks players crashing toward him, Dalton stepped up and fired a bomb into the end zone. At the same time, the rookie receiver A.J. Green had gained a step on Seattle safety Earl Thomas. As Green reached the end zone, Dalton's pass hit him perfectly in stride for a 46-yard touchdown. It was the fifth touchdown reception for Green this season, and the fourth time he's connected with Dalton for a score (Bruce Gradkowski was responsible for Green's first touchdown catch as a pro).  If Green and Dalton can connect six more times over the next nine weeks, they will become the first pair of rookie teammates to combine for 10 passing touchdowns."

But when her faked promiscuity generates an unexpected chain reaction, she sews a capital A on her clothes and parades around the school in suggestive outfits. Amanda Bynes is the leader of the Christian club who denounces Olive. Penn Badgley is Olive's prince in waiting, and he's not buying her act.

The show, which stars Dylan McDermott and Connie Britton as a struggling married couple living in a haunted Los Angeles mansion where people can't seem to stop dying, has been a hit for the cable network, drawing nearly 3.2 million viewers for its Oct. 5 debut and averaging about 2.8 million for each new installment. FX said that, through four episodes, ''American Horror Story'' was on track to become the highest-rated first season of any series it has broadcast, surpassing Mr. Murphy's plastic-surgery drama ''Nip/Tuck,'' which began in 2003. The second season of ''American Horror Story'' will run 13 episodes; no debut was immediately announced, though it will likely run in the fall, at which point we'll know whether it's more or less terrifying than Charlie Sheen's new FX series, ''Anger Management.''

Grandfather of Jacqueline, Angelique, and Nicholas Sarro; Ayana and Anthony Sarro; and Rudolph III, Christian, Nicole, and Vincent Sarro; and ""Uncle Rudy"" to 12 nephews and nieces, their families and even their friends. Rudy grew up in a close-knit Italian-American community on 48th St. and 2nd Ave. in Manhattan. Like his beloved twin sister Lucy, he worked at his family's newsstand. After his brothers and his friend Hugo Coruzzi were called up to fight in World War II, Rudy signed up; on the way to Japan, his battalion (7th Division, 31st Infantry) was diverted to guard the smoldering situation in Korea. After his honorable service, he opened a luncheonette in his old neighborhood, where heavyweight boxing champion Rocky Marciano was a customer and good friend. Rudy married the lovely Gioia Franzi and they raised three remarkable sons and the three daughters of his widowed sister Lucy. Family was everything, but there was always a place for more at their dining table. Following his position as a law clerk at Shearman & Sterling, he served as a Senior Inspector and Compliance Officer for the State of New York Department of Agriculture, and in an environment that strewed an inspector's path with temptation and threats, he was a fortress of integrity. He was enormously proud of his three sons, all of them gentlemen, good husbands and fathers. His family and friends knew they could count on him for sage advice, and when anyone was in a tough spot, he would somehow appear at the moment when help was needed most.

The plan, released last week as part of Mr. Perry's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, allows taxpayers to calculate their personal income taxes under the existing tax code, which is progressive. But it also allows taxpayers to instead have their income taxed at a flat 20 percent rate. In this alternative system, long-term capital gains, qualified dividends and Social Security benefits would not be taxed, and only a handful of deductions would be allowed.

However, having now seen them live, I can tell you that this is not the whole story. They simply played too well, and were too obviously moved by the unconditional love of the crowd, which cheered as vociferously for the B-sides as for the singles. Frank howled as ferociously as ever, and it was inspiring to see Kim Deal, the bass player, in such apparently sound mental and physical health. This I did not expect. In 2002, a story in this magazine by Ethan Smith detailed the problems, personal and otherwise, she had making a record for her other band, the Breeders. It included this memorable exchange between Kim and her twin sister, Kelley, who had been in and out of the band a few times:"

2011-11-02T09:00:28Z,"Inscrutable? Cryptic? Finding the right word to describe Bradford Cox is not easy. The Atlanta-based musician, lead singer of the popular indie rock band Deerhunter and mastermind behind the more esoteric solo project Atlas Sound, is tall and lanky and moves with a long, excited gait thanks to a genetic condition of the connective tissue called Marfan Syndrome. He's gone through wild periods of provocation involving onstage cross-dressing and fake blood. He's written song lyrics inspired by subversive Dennis Cooper novels. Spending time with him is a roller coaster ride that sweeps those around him up through various random-seeming whims and high-strung emotions. Despite all of this, or more likely because of all this, he is prolific with at least eleven albums and EPs to his name since 2005. His latest album, ""Parallax,"" released under his solo moniker, further proves Cox's lo-fi genius, showcasing his deftness at weaving multilayered lyrics through harmonizing electronic tones and across undulating beats to create catchy but complex pop songs. It's worth noting that the album's title refers to the optical effect wherein our perceptions of various objects' relative positions depend on our distance from them - if you drive down a highway, the tree line whizzes past while faraway objects like the sun barely move at all. It's one of those facts in nature that seems intuitive and yet, upon examination, gets quite confusing quite fast. The same can be said of Cox's songs. Here we present an exclusive stream of the complete ""Parallax"" album (out next week, Nov. 8, from 4AD), along with a few words from Cox explaining the meaning of and inspiration behind four of his favorite songs - explanations he offers in his own signature fashion, without making any distinction between the technical, musical, literary or lyrical aspects of his work."

2011-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Hugh Jackman's new concert on Broadway set a house record at the Broadhurst Theater, earning more than of $1.2 million last week, a result of the producers' decision to charge exorbitant prices for tickets to Mr. Jackman's first return to Broadway as a singer since his Tony Award-winning performance in ''The Boy from Oz'' eight years ago. The previous record at the Broadhurst was about $1.18 set by a production of ''Merchant of Venice'' starring Al Pacino during the week between Christmas and New Year's Day last season. Adopting the money-making strategy of ''The Book of Mormon,'' ''Wicked,'' ''The Lion King,'' and other top-grossing Broadway shows, the 10-week engagement of ''Hugh Jackman, Back on Broadway'' is selling tickets for up to $350 a piece - double the top face value of $175 for orchestra seats for that production. Several ticket agents said in interviews that, like airlines, theater producers are now increasing seat prices on a day-to-day, even hour-by-hour basis depending on the tilt of supply and demand.

2011-11-02T00:00:00Z,"With two minutes left in the first half, the Bengals led the Seahawks, 10-3, on Sunday. Cincinnati called a play-action pass, but the pocket collapsed on the rookie quarterback Andy Dalton as he began to execute the fake handoff. With multiple Seahawks players crashing toward him, Dalton stepped up and fired a bomb into the end zone. At the same time, the rookie receiver A.J. Green had gained a step on Seattle safety Earl Thomas. As Green reached the end zone, Dalton's pass hit him perfectly in stride for a 46-yard touchdown. It was the fifth touchdown reception for Green this season, and the fourth time he's connected with Dalton for a score (Bruce Gradkowski was responsible for Green's first touchdown catch as a pro). If Green and Dalton can connect six more times over the next nine weeks, they will become the first pair of rookie teammates to combine for 10 passing touchdowns. A.J. Green's success has been a matter of when, not if; Sports Illustrated profiled him after his sophomore season in high school and correctly tabbed that he'd star in the N.F.L. by 2011. As a true freshman, Green led the Southeastern Conference in receiving yards and touchdowns. Against eventual national champion Auburn, Green caught 9 passes for 164 yards and 2 touchdowns. To no one's surprise, he was the first receiver off the board, at No. 4 in the 2011 draft."

O. Scott, in The New York Times, called ''Sofia Coppola's exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious fourth feature.'' What happens, Mr. Scott added, ''is something marvelous: a film that never raises its voice (its loudest and most assertive sound is that Ferrari) or panders to your emotions, but that nonetheless has the power to refresh your perceptions and deepen your sympathies. As it proceeds from one careful, watchful, slow shot to the next, a sad and affecting story emerges, about a father's loneliness and a daughter's devotion. But the experience of watching 'Somewhere,' shot in lovely tones of Southern California haze by the great Harris Savides, is like reading a poem. The scenes play off one another like stanzas, producing patterns and echoes that feel like the camera's accidental discoveries, even as they are the surest evidence of Ms. Coppola's formidable and subtle art.'' 10:15 A.M.

''There is, in Ms. Munro's mature work, a flinty wisdom about heterosexual love, a skepticism about romantic ideals that does not altogether deny their power or necessity,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''Ms. Polley, rather remarkably for someone still in her 20s, shows an intuitive grasp of this wisdom and a welcome, unsentimental interest in the puzzles and pleasures of a long, imperfect marriage.'' He added, ''I can't remember the last time the movies yielded up a love story so painful, so tender and so true.''"

Grandfather of Jacqueline, Angelique, and Nicholas Sarro; Ayana and Anthony Sarro; and Rudolph III, Christian, Nicole, and Vincent Sarro; and ""Uncle Rudy"" to 12 nephews and nieces, their families and even their friends. Rudy grew up in a close-knit Italian-American community on 48th St. and 2nd Ave. in Manhattan. Like his beloved twin sister Lucy, he worked at his family's newsstand. After his brothers and his friend Hugo Coruzzi were called up to fight in World War II, Rudy signed up; on the way to Japan, his battalion (7th Division, 31st Infantry) was diverted to guard the smoldering situation in Korea. After his honorable service, he opened a luncheonette in his old neighborhood, where heavyweight boxing champion Rocky Marciano was a customer and good friend. Rudy married the lovely Gioia Franzi and they raised three remarkable sons and the three daughters of his widowed sister Lucy. Family was everything, but there was always a place for more at their dining table. Following his position as a law clerk at Shearman & Sterling, he served as a Senior Inspector and Compliance Officer for the State of New York Department of Agriculture, and in an environment that strewed an inspector's path with temptation and threats, he was a fortress of integrity. He was enormously proud of his three sons, all of them gentlemen, good husbands and fathers. His family and friends knew they could count on him for sage advice, and when anyone was in a tough spot, he would somehow appear at the moment when help was needed most. Protective, wise, vigilant, optimistic, a lover of life and family, a noble soul. The light of his presence will be sorely missed. The wake will be held at Fred H. McGrath & Son, Funeral Home, 20 Cedar St., Bronxville, NY 10708, 914-337-6770, Tuesday 6 to 9pm and Wednesday between 2 to 4 and 7-9pm. Funeral Mass Thursday 3 November at 10am, at the Church of St. Joseph, 15 Cedar St., Bronxville, NY 10708."

2011-11-02T00:00:00Z,"BERNSTEIN--Allen J. Castle Harlan, Inc. is deeply saddened by the passing of our cherished friend and colleague, Allen J. Bernstein of Manhasset, NY. He was a recognized leader and visionary in the restaurant industry, one of the finest minds in the business and a true friend. He was 65. While earning a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Marketing from the University of Miami, Allen wrote his senior thesis on the emerging practice of restaurant branding, and in that process, identified his lifelong career. After graduating in 1968, he began purchasing franchises in such companies as Hardee's, Long John Silvers, Wendy's, Godfather's Pizza, Luther's Bar-B-Que and LePeep. His Wendy's outlet across from Penn Station in New York once was the busiest Wendy's in the United States. In 1988, Allen and Castle Harlan formed Quantum Restaurant Group to build national chains around great restaurant concepts. Allen was Chief Executive Officer of Quantum until he retired in 2005. Under his leadership, the company's first acquisition was the Peasant Restaurants in Atlanta. In 1989, the company acquired Morton's of Chicago, the renowned chain of steakhouses, which was one of Allen's proudest career achievements. The restaurant chain grew in number from nine units at acquisition to 79 today, and became so successful that Quantum's name was changed to Morton's Restaurant Group in 1996 to emphasize a focus on the namesake brand. When he retired, Allen remained Chairman Emeritus of Morton's and continued to serve in a significant ongoing advisory role. At the time of his death, he was President of Endeavor Restaurant Group, Inc., Director of the Bravo Brio Restaurant Group and Director of Cheesecake Factory, Inc. He served on the boards of directors of a number of privately held companies, including Caribbean Restaurants, LLC, the exclusive Burger King franchise in Puerto Rico. Previously, he served as a director of Charlie Brown's Steakhouse, McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurants and Dave & Busters, Inc. He also served on the board of trustees of the American Film Institute. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Lori Waltzer Bernstein, sister Helene Morrison, his two children, Stacey Stolar and Adam Bernstein, his daughter-in-law, Jessica Manis Bernstein, and granddaughter Sarah Stolar. A memorial service will be held at 10am on Wednesday, November 2nd at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York, NY 10023. Allen's Colleagues at Castle Harlan, Inc."

2011-11-02T00:00:00Z,"If there were any doubt remaining, the scandal surrounding the Olympus Corporation of Japan has proved Michael Crichton wrong. What does the late Mr. Crichton, the author of ''Jurassic Park'' among other books, have to do with this, you may be asking? Mr. Crichton was responsible for ''Rising Sun,'' the popular book and movie that appeared in the early 1990s when Japan was today's China, about to dominate the world. In ''Rising Sun,'' Japanese businessmen were portrayed as crafty, willing to do anything to succeed against the bumbling Americans. Japanese were even stealing our women, arranging for them to serve as sushi platters at their decadent parties (you have to see the movie to believe this one) . ''Rising Sun'' and movies like ''Gung Ho,'' which starred Michael Keaton and involved the Japanese takeover of an American auto plant, created a perception that Japanese businesses were going to dominate the world. The Japanese were consensus driven and without the fractious disputes of American capitalism."

Past explorations have yielded flax rope furniture and lighting by Christien Meindertsma, brightly colored striped woolen blankets and pillows by Scholten & Baijings, and pewter objects by Studio Job. For Schwarm, he worked with the German artists Beate Reinheimer and Ulrike Rehm, known as RaR, who are fascinated with the dizzying diversity of the animal kingdom, particularly among insects. To wit, Schwarm features 10 different shapes, or genuses, and 63 species, each with a different glaze.

It was the 11th No. 1 single she has recorded, giving her the same number as Whitney Houston and more top singles than Stevie Wonder or Janet Jackson."

The singers, Jay Hunter Morris and Deborah Voigt, performed the scene in an area at the front of the stage. The set, consisting of a row of revolving planks around an axis that rises and falls, takes on different formations and serves as a backdrop for sophisticated projections.

He leaves his wife of 56 years, Patricia (Pat) Fox Hefele (Portland); his son, Brian Hefele and daughter-in-law, Nici Griffith (Portland); his daughters, Rosanne Miller (Wilmington, DE) and Alison Bonney (Chicago, IL); his daughter-in-law, Lory Hefele (Portland); his brother, George Hefele (Redford, MI); eight grandchildren; and many friends. He is preceded in death by his son, Kenneth Hefele. Jack was born and raised in the Bronx, New York City, and was the son of George and Rosemary (Mallen) Hefele. His career, travel and retirement to Arizona took him far away from New York, but Jack never forgot his Bronx roots or his strong allegiance to the New York Yankees. After graduating from Evander Childs High School, he went on to graduate from Iona College in 1954 with a degree in business administration. He met his wife, Pat Fox, at St. Brendan's parish and in 1955 they were married at St. Philip & James Roman Catholic Church. Shortly thereafter, Jack joined the U.S. Army. He and Pat started their married life in Fort Hood, Texas. In 1956 Jack began working for General Motors Overseas Operations in New York City. During his 35-year career with GM, he was transferred to several locations including posts in Beirut, Lebanon, Honolulu, Hawaii and Detroit, Michigan. On behalf of GM International Marketing & Sales, he traveled extensively throughout the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Jack got satisfaction from his work, pleasure from playing golf and joy from entertaining with stories. He was especially proud of the international experiences and quality education that he, and his wife Pat, provided for their children. Often outspoken but always funny, kind and generous, Jack will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved him. A funeral service will be held on Saturday, November 5th at 11:00am at St Mary's Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception 1716 NW Davis St., Portland, OR.

I have regretted that decision ever since, not so much because they did anything unseemly with the footage - the clip was actually adorable - but because I relinquished control over how she'd be presented.

Scott Fitzgerald's meditation on the American dream is stirring a fresh round of adaptations.

In the foyer, a turn-of-the-century painting of a bourgeois Swedish interior hangs beneath one of Isamu Noguchi's oversize paper lanterns, and underfoot is a colorful mid-20th-century rug by Barbro Nilsson for the renowned Swedish workshop MMF. Under a midcentury nude painted by Birger Ljungquist, Gustafson's great-uncle, sits a simple 1950s stool by the Swedish designer Carl Malmsten. Walk through an angled doorway into the living room, a high-ceilinged space with the graceful proportions and architectural ornament typical of late-19th-century buildings, and the mix gets even richer. An upholstered 19th-century Swedish bench along the window and a group of slipper chairs, all from Gustafson's family, blend easily with sheepskin-covered wood chairs designed in the 1930s by Bruno Mathsson and tables by Josef Frank. Vases by Scandinavian Modern ceramics masters like Axel Salto and Berndt Friberg are clustered atop a traditional tiled fireplace, and the immaculate plaster walls (which are painted, aptly enough, Stockholm White) are hung with Gustafson's spare, elegant watercolors. Venture into the apartment's long corridor, however, and you'll find up-to-the-minute bathrooms and a sunny, south-facing kitchen in which crisp, utilitarian cabinets provide a clean backdrop for an antique wooden table and chairs. This is an interior that's modern and old-fashioned at the same time, and in all the right ways."

The musicians Pete Seeger, Earl Scruggs, Taj Mahal, Béla Fleck and the Carolina Chocolate Drops weigh in, along with historians, instruments builders and collectors; Rosanne Cash hosts. This is part of the PBS Arts Fall Festival. 4:30 P.M. (HBO) INCEPTION (2010) Leonardo DiCaprio, below, stars as Cobb, a specialist in corporate mental espionage who, using a combination of drugs, wires and other Matrix-y methods penetrates the minds of his sleeping targets to extract information. Ken Watanabe is Saito, the wealthy client who has hired Cobb and his associates (Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page, among others) to undertake the trick known as inception, which involves planting an idea in someone's mind that will come to fruition in the real world. Their mission: to induce a young man (Cillian Murphy), whose father (Pete Postlethwaite) is a business rival of Saito's, to break up the company he is about to inherit. Cobb, meanwhile, can't stop thinking about his wife (Marion Cotillard). The movie, directed by Christopher Nolan, ''trades in crafty puzzles rather than profound mysteries, and gestures in the direction of mighty philosophical questions that Mr. Nolan is finally too tactful, too timid or perhaps just too busy to engage,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Still, Mr. Scott said of the film, which won Oscars for cinematography, sound mixing, sound editing and visual effects, ''A lot of this is -- what is the critical term of art I'm looking for? -- pretty cool.''"

2011-11-04T00:00:00Z,"An article on Wednesday about delays in a program to disband private security companies in Afghanistan and replace them with government forces paraphrased incorrectly from a statement about the plan by the Afghan Interior Ministry. The ministry said it was focused on disbanding a wide range of private security companies, not just those with ties to government officials. The article also misstated the source of $35 million to $40 million that a NATO official said would finance a task force to aid the effort. The Pentagon will ask Congress to reallocate all of it from funds already designated for security in Afghanistan; the program will not use a mix of new and reallocated money."

As a former United States senator and a former governor of New Jersey, as well as the leader of Goldman Sachs in the 1990s, Mr. Corzine carried significant weight in the worlds of Washington and Wall Street. While other financial firms employed teams of lobbyists to fight the new regulation, MF Global's chief executive in meetings over the last year personally pressed regulators to halt their plans."

TPG's decision comes even as many other private equity shops are balking at signing such an agreement, since its terms include a prohibition on talking with other potential suitors. Many of these possible bidders have argued that such a ''no cross-talk'' provision would limit their ability to cobble together a full takeover offer for Yahoo, given the company's nearly $20 billion market value."

The company said on Thursday that its Dec. 13 performance of ''George Balanchine's The Nutcracker'' will be transmitted live in high definition to more than 500 movie theaters around the country. In a statement, the company's executive director, Katherine E. Brown, said City Ballet hoped it would be the ''first of many'' such transmissions. A City Ballet neighbor at Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Opera, pioneered cinema broadcasts of cultural events five years ago and has built an audience of several hundred thousand around the world for each transmission. Other opera, ballet and theater companies and orchestras have started the practice. They include the Royal Opera and National Theater in London; the Paris Opera and Bolshoi ballets; the Los Angeles Philharmonic; the La Scala opera house in Milan; and the Gran Teatre del Liceu opera in Barcelona. Cultural institutions see HD transmissions as a way to vastly enlarge audiences, build revenues and help grow their art forms' popularity.

She has no known survivors. A native of San Antonio, Texas, Mrs. Barth was the only child of the late Mary Ficklin Summers and J. Harold Williams. In 1952, she graduated from Trinity University in San Antonio, with a double major in English and Humanities. In the Class of 1952's Last Will and Testament to Trinity University, Doris left ""her appreciation of literature to the Humanities Department, because no one else seemed interested."" She also earned a Master's in English from Trinity in 1954 and taught in the English Department from 1956-1963. A favorite with both students and colleagues, she was regularly voted Faculty Princess or Duchess during her tenure at Trinity. At Trinity University, she also met and married Wilbur Barth, who was a Trinity Alumnus, holding an undergraduate and Master's degree in mathematics. He died in 1981. Upon their move to Manhattan, Mrs. Barth worked as a commercial writer. She was also a congregant at Saint Bartholomew's Church (NYC) and eventually at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue. At Saint Thomas Church, she volunteered in the soup kitchen for years and made many friends and acquaintances there. She also did volunteer work at The Hospital of Special Surgery, often talking to prospective patients about their upcoming surgeries based on her own knowledge and experiences. The staff at HSS remembers her with great fondness. Mrs. Barth will be interred in the Saint Thomas Church Columbarium, next to her ""beloved Wilbur."" A Memorial Service for Mrs. Barth will take place on November 8th at 2pm in the Chantry Chapel of Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, 1 West 53rd Street, Manhattan. Instead of flowers, donations should be made to either Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue or The Hospital of Special Surgery."

The drama centers on a female inmate with a radical past, pleading for parole with the prison's female warden; a battle of words and wits ensues over politics, money and religion. On Thursday the Broadway producers Jeffrey Richards and Jerry Frankel said they had found a duo who, no question, know something about stage combat: The Tony Award winner Patti LuPone (''Gypsy,'' ''Evita'') will play the inmate and the Emmy winner Laurie Metcalf (''Roseanne'') will play the warden in a Broadway production scheduled to open in fall 2012. Mr. Mamet, a Pulitzer Prize winner for ''Glengarry Glen Ross,'' will direct the play, as he did with his last verbal slugfest on Broadway, ''Race,'' which ran for nine months in a commercial run mounted by Mr. Richards and Mr. Frankel, among others.

In place of shared abundance, battles at every level of government now focus on picking the losers who will bear the costs of deficit reduction and austerity. Fights in Washington are over inflicting pain on antagonists either through spending cuts or tax increases, a struggle over who will get a smaller piece of a shrinking pie. This hostile climate stands in sharp contrast to the post-World-War II history of economic growth. Worse, current income and employment trends suggest that this is not a temporary shift."

Based in Basel, Switzerland, the label shares the same sturdy spirit as its brother brand, but the fabrics are more refined, the collaborations more high end, and the silhouettes much slimmer. For example, the company's famed canvas work pants are in the line, but they come in an Italian duck canvas milled for Work in Progress. At the SoHo store, a wall is dedicated to slim, tapered trousers, and the sweaters, once built tooth-and-nail tough, come in a soft, brushed cotton. The best thing about the shop (besides the roughly hewn wood floor boards and the meticulous merchandising) is the staff. Each member is tremendously helpful, and the adopted uniform of canvas pants, pocket tees and woolen beanies worn high suggests that the '90s spirit of Carhartt is still very much alive. Shown: coat, $268; shirt, $168; and pants, $125. Carhartt Work in Progress, 119 Crosby Street; (212) 219-2934; carhartt-wip.com. ISAAC HINDIN MILLER"

Ramdane is a new line of clothing and accessories for men and women, a concept store with locations planned for Paris, Rome, London and Tokyo, and the brainchild of Ramdane Touhami, who conceived the space, designs the merchandise and, as its recent week's soft opening, could be found working the sales floor of this genuinely lo-fi and coyly highbrow operation.

2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"NORA KOGAN, the Brooklyn jewelry designer behind St. Kilda, is best known for costume pieces like the Surrealist-inspired Man Ray lip cuffs that are favored by fashion insiders like the blogger Garance Doré. Now she's designing higher-end baubles under her own name. The first Nora Kogan collection, called Anastasia, is inspired by a Fabergé egg that, according to family lore, her Russian grandfather acquired during World War II in exchange for a box of chocolates. The egg disappeared, presumably into the pockets of a Soviet customs official, when the family immigrated to Australia in the '70s, but Ms. Kogan retains clear memories of it. ''It opened up into three sections, and in the center was a hand-painted icon,'' said Ms. Kogan, who riffs on Fabergé's legendary craftsmanship and stylized nature motifs in pieces like these diamond drop earrings and ring. ''Designing this collection has been therapeutic for me, as I'm still often haunted by this loss.'' NANCY MacDONELL"

2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"In 1948, the architect and inventor Buckminster Fuller gathered a group of his students at Black Mountain College to build a life-size geodesic dome. The dome was a flop. It succeeded, however, in planting the seed for the sculptor Kenneth Snelson, a student of Fuller's, to develop the principle of tensegrity that would allow Fuller to build a dome for the United States Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal. For the Performa 11 biennial (11.performa-arts.org), the Los Angeles artist Liz Glynn will retrace Fuller's steps, pratfalls and all. Part 1 of her performance - a loosely choreographed re-enactment of Fuller's failed attempt - takes place on the first Sunday of the biennial in locations throughout New York City, including Times Square; for Part 2, 25 volunteers will assist in building a dome. Whether it will stand remains to be seen. But Glynn's cast-concrete dome sculptures (above), on view at the Performa Hub through Nov. 21, are objects of perfection of which even Fuller might have approved. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

While the Carson Palmer (Oakland, vs. DEN) era in Oakland officially began in Week 7, and boy was it ugly, this game will be his first start for the Silver and Black. In fantasy terms, the matchup doesn't get any better, with the Broncos allowing the most fantasy points to the position through the first eight weeks. Still, starting Palmer does mean you are pretty desperate, even more desperate than the guy rolling with Seattle's Tarvaris Jackson. But with the bye weeks still hovering over many of you, you can do worse than rolling the dice with Palmer, who claims to be comfortable now with Oakland's playbook and his new receivers.

2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"The abstract paintings shown here are not by Kazimir Malevich or Paul Klee but by Hindu tantra devotees from Indian cities like Jodhpur and Chomu, the anonymous heirs to a pictorial tradition that dates to the 1600s. Painted on salvaged paper and rarely measuring more than a foot high, the images possess a strange kinship with 20th-century art. And their agelessness cast a spell over Franck Andre Jamme, a French poet who nearly got himself killed tracking down these works across the deserts of Rajasthan. In 1985, Jamme was on a bus to Jaipur when his driver fell asleep and smashed into an oncoming truck, killing seven people. Jamme suffered a series of comas but eventually returned to India. After consulting a soothsayer, he resumed his quest to befriend tantrikas and understand their meditative art form, which originated in handwritten religious texts but is today mostly neglected on the subcontinent. ''I needed around 20 years to find the good nests, the good families where people were still making these marvels,'' Jamme said. His discoveries are newly collected in ''Tantra Song'' (Siglio, $40). They were first exhibited in 1994 at the gallery of Agnes b. in Paris, where Jamme hung this triumphant notice: ''Perhaps rarely in the universal history of painting have works at once so mysterious and simple, yet so powerful and pure, ever been produced - a bit as if, here, man's genius had been able to assemble almost everything in almost nothing.''"

2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"A parish priest on the Faeroe Islands in the 17th century left behind an account of a grindadrap -- Faeroese for ''whale hunt'' -- a grisly spectacle in which pilot whales were killed ''with such fury on both sides,'' he wrote, ''that the water becometh as red as blood.'' For generations, the grindadrap has been a mainstay of life on the Faeroes, an archipelago roughly equidistant from Norway, Iceland and Scotland, and the practice continues today, over the protests of animal rights groups, which call it cruel. But the islanders, most of them descendants of Viking settlers, bristle at outside interference. The Faeroese maintain that the hunting of pilot whales is sustainable and regulated, and the whales are killed with a grindaknivur -- a traditional knife that severs the spinal cord and causes the animals to lose consciousness within seconds. But the grindadrap is more than a cultural institution. The whale meat and blubber are part of the national diet, dried and salted and distributed across the islands. And there's no guarantee of a successful hunt: in 2008, possibly because of changes in water temperature, ocean currents and the distribution of prey, no whales were caught at all.

2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"EVERYONE -- conservative and liberal -- agrees that $2.6 trillion a year is too much to spend on health care, and that we have to cut costs. But they don't agree on who is to blame or what is to be done. Everett M. Dirksen, the Republican senator from Illinois, reportedly said, ''a billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money.'' But health care spending in the United States typically increases by about $100 billion per year. Cutting a billion here or there from something that large is undetectable. In health care, you have to be talking about tens of billions of dollars before you are talking about real money. A useful threshold for savings is 1 percent of costs, which comes to $26 billion a year. Anything less is simply not meaningful."

2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Before she died in 1996 at age 61, the designer Isabelle Hebey said she would leave nothing undone, no aspirations unfulfilled. (Well, almost none: she always joked about redoing the Vatican.) Hebey even drew up new plans for her Paris apartment, tailored to the son who would inherit it, right down to rearranging the furniture. In planning her funeral, however, she did not go as far as another autocratic designer of her generation, David Hicks, who sketched his own coffin. But she did get to choose hers. ''It was very surreal,'' recalls Emmanuel Hebey, the noted mathematician and Isabelle's son. ''The man who sold it to us was rather surprised.'' That she sought to control the visual world from beyond the grave shocks no one who knew her. Born on the island of Martinique into a French colonial family whose conservatism she would look back on with horror, Hebey began working in Paris in the 1950s, creating everything from pens, watches and public housing to modular bathrooms, car interiors and cribs for the likes of Sophia Loren, the culinary writer Christian Millau and Bao Long, the last crown prince of Vietnam."

2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"''A brick Georgian was never my dream house,'' insists the artist Laurie Simmons. In the fall of 2000, when Simmons was given the opportunity to design a house - O.K., a dollhouse - from the ground up, she collaborated with the architect Peter Wheelwright to create a very colorful, almost Modernist abode filled with works of pint-size contemporary art and design. And yet, the first time she walked through the front door of the near-textbook brick Georgian in northwestern Connecticut that she and her husband, the artist Carroll Dunham, eventually came to own, ''something came over me,'' she recalls. She said to Dunham, ''If this house were a man, you'd be toast.'' The house, which was built around the turn of the last century, had been used until recently as the administration building for the Marvelwood School, a private boarding school. An adjacent barn once contained a cafeteria, science labs, music-rehearsal rooms and a half basketball court, where dances were occasionally held."

In fact, the unit is quite American, a remnant of George Washington's Continental Army, created in 1790 to defend the homeland of New York. The photographer Christopher Lane first spotted the men -- and their eye-catching military wear -- at a Veterans Day parade three years ago and knew at once that he had to visit them at their headquarters, the Park Avenue Armory, to make formal portraits."

2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"''Talk about sausages for a style magazine based in New York? Tremendous!'' wrote Sam Baron in response to our questions about the T he created for our Design and Living issue. Turns out Baron, who is the design director at Fabrica, is also an avid foodie, and splitting his time between Paris, Portugal and Treviso, Italy, where Fabrica's headquarters are located, has taught him quite a lot on the subject of sausages (glass and otherwise). Here, the designer indulges in some of his favorite saucisson. You've made glass sausages before. Tell us about the project that preceded this T. Two years ago, Monica Khemsurov and Jill Singer of Sight Unseen invited me to participate in the Noho Design District, part of which they were organizing in a building once owned by Andy Warhol and that's now occupied by a Japanese butcher shop called Japan Premium Beef. The butchers there sell this very rarefied meat, and since I am a French designer and come from saucisson country, I thought that the best and most interesting way to connect my work with the butcher shop was to dress their windows with a generous group of iconic sausage shapes."

He sits in one of the Finnish designer Yrjo Kukkapuro's Karuselli chairs not just because it's a design classic, but also because its curves soothe his bones. ''I have a fairly bad back,'' he admits. But don't make the mistake of assuming that his retrospective exhibition, ''Terence Conran: The Way We Live Now,'' at the Design Museum in London from Nov. 16 through March 4, 2012, is a swan song. ''I suppose they might see it like that,'' says Conran, the chairman of Conran Holdings, whose work spans product design, branding, architecture, retail outlets and restaurants. ''But it clearly is not.'' He points to the recent debut of the Conran exclusive design collection, a line of furniture for Marks & Spencer, one of Britain's biggest midmarket chains, as further proof that he is still very much responsible for the Way Britons Live Now."

2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Packers (7-0) at Chargers (4-3) Sunday, 4:15 p.m. Line: Packers by 5 .5. The Chargers' Monday night loss to the Chiefs was so heartbreaking that San Diego State men's basketball coach Steve Fisher offered Norv Turner his services as a psychoanalyst. Fisher coached the Michigan's Fab Five in 1993, the year Chris Webber lost the championship game when he incurred a technical foul for calling a timeout his team did not have. (The N.C.A.A. swears none of this ever happened, of course, because the Fab Five never existed to them.) Parallels to the fourth-quarter fumble by Philip Rivers are obvious, and Fisher told The San Diego Union-Tribune that the Chargers could benefit from Turner's patented not-so-tough love. ''Most of the time you get there because your best player is your best player,'' he said. ''And then when things happen, you still have to wrap an arm around him and say, 'You're our best player.' '' Unfortunately, Turner must identify his best player before hugging it out. Rivers is in a wicked slump that goes beyond fourth quarter fumbles. Receiver Vincent Jackson (four catches on 16 throws in two games) is doing everything possible to not get open. Antonio Gates is battling through injuries. The defense is now populated by no-names. Kicker Nick Novak leads the Chargers in scoring, but no one wants to wrap an arm around a kicker. Turner must identify and embrace said ''best player'' before facing the Packers, a team too predictably excellent to talk about. The Packers just win, with no Dream Team acquisitions, mysterious commissioner's office meetings, or polarizing, bumbling, cult hero quarterbacks to obsess about. That makes it more fun to write about the Lions' goon squad nouveau reputation, the Cowboys' never-ending quest to convince the world that they are still relevant or Turner wandering through the Chargers' clubhouse with his arms outstretched and a message of reassurance on his lips. Pick: Packers."
2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"In Metropolitan's cover article last week, ''Storing the Stuff of Dreams,'' Mark Lamster profiled Day & Meyer, Murray & Young, a company that has warehoused the art, furniture and bric-a-brac of elite Manhattan residents in its Upper East Side tower since 1928. Readers wrote to NYTimes.com to share their thoughts on the acquisitiveness of the rich and the not so rich; below is a sampling. They also debated Ginia Bellafante's Big City column about the latest in a succession of status objects that have fostered urban crime: the iPhone. Fascinating story.

2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"After six years of uncertainty following the end of the war, Wallis still felt rootless and ''homeless on the face of the earth.'' The Windsors rented and borrowed houses until there could be no possible doubt that returning to England was out of the question. It was Wallis who finally recognized that there would never be meaningful work offered to the duke and that they would never be able to make their home in England. She had always shown remarkable self-awareness of her own shortcomings, even if she was unable to change them, and now she tried to give the duke some of the courage she was scraping together as he, often depressed or ill, faced a still-hostile family and an ever colder world. Their first trip to England together in the fall of 1946 was a disaster. They stayed with their friends the Earl and Countess of Dudley at Ednam Lodge. On Oct. 16 a burglar broke into the house and stole Wallis's jewelry, which she had left unsecured when they went out for the evening. Wallis was distraught; the jewelry had defined her romance with the then prince and given her security. An exotic bird of paradise brooch, with a cabochon sapphire breast and a plumage of diamonds, had just been made for her by Cartier that year. She never saw it, or any of the other stolen pieces, again."

2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Ten years is the length of an average commercial lease, but it's also, as the designer Ted Muehling has discovered, the approximate life span of a neighborhood. Back in 2001, Muehling moved his storefront workshop from a formerly desolate block on Greene Street to Howard Street - at the time SoHo's final frontier. But when a Mondrian hotel went up nearby, so did Muehling's rent, and the designer moved on once again. His new store, on White Street in TriBeCa, is grander in proportion and there is more selling space, but also more space for Muehling to display the many things he collects and that inspire him, from natural wonders like seashells or insects to the work of his partner, the artist Mats Gustafson, or that of his friend Jan Baracz, who carves bellybuttons into large stones. And while his workrooms are smaller, for the first time Muehling has a little studio all his own - an ''attic'' tucked into a mezzanine under a skylight in the back. The timing could not have been better. With his product collaborations with Nymphenburg and Steuben winding down, Muehling is eager to get back to making jewelry. On a recent morning, a pair of canaries twittered joyfully, and an installation of monarch butterflies on a dried mullein stem was magically animated by a breeze from the air-conditioner. As with his previous store, this one is livened by sounds from behind the scenes - the bang of metal on metal, the murmur of NPR - evidence that this is a place where things are made and not just sold. It's the kind of neighborhood place, Muehling points out, where you can walk in and they'll make a new wire for your earring if you don't mind waiting 20 minutes. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

''He wants to be loved, and so he has movies that dumb down, that explain everything, that give audiences what he thinks they want. (Apparently they do.)

There's no question about his technical expertise, but his artistic judgment is, it seems to me, cheap, easy, kitschy.''"

2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Two great tastes don't always taste great together. The same can be true for design collaborations. Heath Ceramics are beautiful. Alabama Chanin textiles are beautiful. Their respective designers, Catherine Bailey and Natalie Chanin, are friends. But could the twain meet? First attempts were not promising. Alabama Chanin clothes and linens deploy embroidery and applique in a modern, layered, bohemian way. The embellishments are frequently mapped out with a stencil, and Bailey initially thought they might use the stencils on her company's classic Coupe dinnerware.''Natalie transfers graphical images by making a stencil and spraying paint on it, but when we stenciled the plates it didn't look crafted,'' Bailey says. ''It looked like spray-painted graphics.'' Bailey quickly realized she needed a better way to translate the exacting techniques used by Chanin's cast of local talent in and around Florence, Ala."
2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"The new Natural History Museum of Utah is so in tune with its environment that it almost blends into the landscape. Called the Rio Tinto Center, the museum sits on 17 acres, terraced along the foothills of the Wasatch mountain range in Salt Lake City. ''We tried not to disturb the site too much because the building is really about the land,'' Todd Schliemann of Ennead Architects, who designed the museum, said. ''It's like a great rock outcrop covered in copper.'' The museum, part of the University of Utah, is to open Nov. 18. In addition to using local resources, elements of sustainable architecture further connect the building to its environment. The water catchment and management system uses a pervious parking lot and plants on the roof's edge to filter storm water slowly into the ground, preventing runoff from washing away large amounts of soil."

In the morning, the trees on the north end of Grand Army Plaza on Fifth Avenue, left, looked as if a tornado had done the pruning, not the weight of wet, heavy snow on branches thick with leaves. The trees on the south end of the plaza remained unscathed. The weather's influence on fashion was immediate. Certainly there was the expected surge in all-black, but more important were the neutrals mixed with fur vests and yards of scarves. The storm brought a first look at winter coats, right. The swirl of a pleated back was as much about swagger as warmth, and one-piece coats fooled the eye with the look of layers. An early color direction is cobalt blue. Ankle-high boot shoes were everywhere, as was the sight of people pulling on winter gloves."

It is owned by an artist, designer and ''nose'' named Christian Astuguevieille, and it is filled with objects covered in rope, cloth and stuffing, and brilliantly hued paint. There is a wooden temple in its palatial air shaft and a room crammed mostly with porcelain. It is a gorgeous, sensual and layered interior ///-- ''I love to mystify'' is how Astuguevieille describes his aesthetic to Guy Trebay (Page 68) -- and one that I find utterly bewitching. The three homes featured in these pages are all owned by artists -- Astuguevieille, Mats Gustafson, Laurie Simmons -- and it would therefore be tempting to label this an art edition of T. I tend to avoid such tags; they always seem banal and commercially driven. What I would say, however, is that all three spaces are disorienting, dramatic and disarmingly beautiful, qualities that one may associate with art. The Stockholm apartment (Page 78) that Mats Gustafson and his partner, Ted Muehling, escape to from New York, writes Pilar Viladas, is like a 19th-century Scandinavian painting -- all light and shadow and moody palette /-- but entirely contemporary. Laurie Simmons's country retreat (Page 84), as Alix Browne discovers, is a larger-than-even-life-size version of the dollhouse that occupies her work and her dreams. It's a magnificent mix of the vernacular and the visionary."

2011-11-06T00:00:00Z,"When you walk into the artist and illustrator Mats Gustafson's apartment in Stockholm, you're not quite sure what era you're in. In the foyer, a turn-of-the-century painting of a bourgeois Swedish interior hangs beneath one of Isamu Noguchi's oversize paper lanterns, and underfoot is a colorful mid-20th-century rug by Barbro Nilsson for the renowned Swedish workshop MMF. Under a midcentury nude painted by Birger Ljungquist, Gustafson's great-uncle, sits a simple 1950s stool by the Swedish designer Carl Malmsten. Walk through an angled doorway into the living room, a high-ceilinged space with the graceful proportions and architectural ornament typical of late-19th-century buildings, and the mix gets even richer. An upholstered 19th-century Swedish bench along the window and a group of slipper chairs, all from Gustafson's family, blend easily with sheepskin-covered wood chairs designed in the 1930s by Bruno Mathsson and tables by Josef Frank. Vases by Scandinavian Modern ceramics masters like Axel Salto and Berndt Friberg are clustered atop a traditional tiled fireplace, and the immaculate plaster walls (which are painted, aptly enough, Stockholm White) are hung with Gustafson's spare, elegant watercolors. Venture into the apartment's long corridor, however, and you'll find up-to-the-minute bathrooms and a sunny, south-facing kitchen in which crisp, utilitarian cabinets provide a clean backdrop for an antique wooden table and chairs. This is an interior that's modern and old-fashioned at the same time, and in all the right ways. Gustafson, a Swede who moved to New York in 1980 (and who now lives in a 19th-century farmhouse in Sag Harbor), had kept a small apartment in this building - an imposing structure in Stockholm's Sodermalm neighborhood - since the 1970s, but when a two-bedroom apartment became available, he couldn't resist. ''I needed a more mature place,'' he said, one that would give him a space to work, and which would also provide comfortable living quarters for him and his partner, the jewelry and product designer Ted Muehling. Gustafson treasured the Old World graciousness of the space and wanted to make it more functional while protecting its considerable charms, ''not to make it into something it wasn't,'' he explained."

''We speak of different processing methods, the 'terroir' associated with different coffees, farms and certification programs,'' says Mr. Chilton, above, a senior.

Housing Department), I got the heave-ho when the owners informed me that they needed the place for family. Having been in this one spot for so long, I actually began to look forward to moving, exploring a new part of town, and even gave some mild thought to deaccessioning some pieces I had collected over the years. On my first day of packing, however, I found a New Yorker cartoon that helped me make up my mind. It showed an old man lying on his deathbed. Looking up at a visitor, he says, ''I should have bought more crap.'' The sentiment touched me deeply, so I called my friend Scott Roberts of Fuller & Roberts Company, an antiques shop in West Hollywood. I had thought it through logically: I love his taste, he's got to love mine; he'll sell what I'm not going to miss; and I'll be able to buy more new old stuff. When he arrived to look at my things, though, I was struck with remorse over breaking up what I thought was a very cool assortment of urbane furniture and accessories. Half-jokingly, I told him, ''You should just recreate my office in your window.'' Oddly, he immediately agreed to do just that."

Enter Glen Oaks Big Sur. A 1950s motor lodge that's been under renovation since 2008, Glen Oaks offers guests the feel of a cabin in the redwoods with some major differences: comfort and style. The owners, Basil and Tracy Sanborn, did not give the structure a face-lift so much as an upgrade, keeping its original adobe walls but adding bamboo floors, designer sinks, double walk-in showers, heated bathroom tiles, modern gas fireplaces and fire pits, Internet access, organic bedding and Pendleton throws. ""We always felt there was an untapped niche here,"" says Basil, who was born in Big Sur. ""Reasonable, high-quality rooms that would attract a demographic not unlike ourselves."" The Sanborns also added cabins to the property, which sit along the Big Sur River on what was previously a campground. Visitors who want to savor one of the most undisturbed forests along the California coast needn't worry: televisions are still a no-no."

2011-11-07T00:00:00Z,"HEARST--John Randolph, Jr.,A trustee of The Hearst Family Trust and a member of the Board of Directors of Hearst Corporation and the two Hearst Foundations, died November 4 in New York City. He was 77. A grandson of William Randolph Hearst, John R. Bunky Hearst, Jr., as he was called most of his life, served as a member of the company's Board of Directors for 44 years. He was appointed a trustee of The Hearst Family Trust in April 1972, the same year he joined the Hearst Foundations as a director. John was always very devoted to the company founded by his grandfather, said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., CEO of Hearst Corporation. He was equally devoted to a number of charitable organizations in the New York area. Those of us who served with him on the various Hearst Boards remember his great wit and interest in everything the company and Foundations were doing. Bunky will be greatly missed. Hearst enjoyed a long career with the Corporation, starting as a news photographer for the Hearst-owned New York Daily Mirror in the 1950s, as well as for the Hearst Newspapers division. In recognition of his interest in photojournalism, Hearst Newspapers commissioned a traveling trophy, the John R. Hearst Jr. Prize for Photo Excellence, awarded to photographers for Hearst Newspapers. An ardent boating enthusiast most of his life, he also served as an editor for Motor Boating & Sailing magazine, which was a Hearst publication. Born in New York City on December 8, 1933, to John Randolph Hearst, the third son of William Randolph Hearst, and Gretchen Wilson, Hearst often spent time in his youth at Hearst Castle in San Simeon, Calif., and greatly valued his time personally spent with his grandfather, the legendary W.R. Hearst. In 1960, John Hearst wrote an article for Reader's Digest entitled Life With Grandfather, in which he detailed their relationship. The younger Hearst's uncle, William Randolph Hearst, Jr., noted: The two talked newspapering a lot. Hearst said that if he learned one thing from his grandfather, it was the power of newspapers. Known for his sense of humor, Hearst enjoyed telling the story of how he had acquired his unusual nickname. He told the New York Times in 1983 that a cartoon character in his grandfather's newspaper, the New York Journal-American, was to blame. I used to wear huge baby bonnets, Hearst was quoted as saying. And my godfather took one look at me and said, He looks like Bunky in the funny papers.' The name stuck. On his 21st birthday, Hearst decided that he no longer resembled a Bunky, he told the Times. But it was too late; the nickname was his for life. I may as well wallow in it, Hearst said. Besides, I'd rather be a Bunky than a Junior. He is survived by his daughter Lisa Hearst Hagerman and his grandchildren, Tenney Hearst Espy, John Hearst Espy and Henry Hearst Hagerman. Services are pending. A memorial service will be announced at a later date. With appreciation, The Hearst Board of Directors"

Its pages are filled with vulgar caricatures and caustic humor, lampooning politicians, entertainers and media personalities of all stripes, and the newspaper has found itself a frequent presence at Paris courts, accused on several dozen occasions of defamation or inciting hate. The world's religions have also been favorite targets of the paper, this being France, where state-mandated secularism is a sort of religion of its own.

2011-11-07T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (Flix) ANTONIA'S LINE (1995) Part fable, part pastoral fantasy, this winner of the Oscar for best foreign film, written and directed by Marleen Gorris, follows the magically feminist bloodline of a Dutch matriarch (Willeke van Ammelrooy, above, with Jan Decleir) as she reflects, over the course of a single day, on her life after World War II. Els Dottermans portrays Danielle, Antonia's daughter, an introvert who isn't too shy to stab the village rapist with a pitchfork. Carolien Spoor, Esther Vriesendorp and Veerle van Overloop play Danielle's intellectually precocious daughter, Therese, at various points in her life. And Elsie de Brauw is Lara, Therese's tutor, with whom Danielle falls in love as she imagines her to be a living version of Botticelli's Venus. ''While the film rejects and even mocks ideas of organized religion, it has a solid faith in nature and destiny, as well as in the fundamental goodness of its women,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. ''It expresses that faith with serene confidence in the cycles of birth, death and replenishment that play out during the story.'' 3 P.M. (Cinemax) HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG (2003) Massoud Behrani (Ben Kingsley, left, in an Oscar-nominated role), an exiled Iranian military officer reduced to menial labor in his adopted homeland, and Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connelly), a house cleaner recovering from years of addiction and the breakup of her marriage, spar -- with tragic consequences -- over a modest piece of coastal California real estate to which both seem to have an equally legitimate claim in this directorial debut from Vadim Perelman, based on the novel by Andre Dubus III. Shohreh Aghdashloo is Nadi, the wife over whom Behrani exercises a brutal tyranny; Ron Eldard is Lester Burdon, the sheriff's deputy who evicted Kathy from her house and now wants to help her get it back. None of the central characters ''are particularly likable, but they all seem worthy of sympathy, in part because they remain capable of showing it,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''Even as the conflict over the house escalates, Behrani, Lester and Kathy all hold on to compassion and decency, and even show signs of a willingness to relent. They seem to agree that no house is worth a human life, which makes the heavily foreshadowed final cataclysm especially painful and powerful.''"

2011-11-08T00:00:00Z,"HEARST--John Randolph, Jr.,A trustee of The Hearst Family Trust and a member of the Board of Directors of Hearst Corporation and the two Hearst Foundations, died November 4 in New York City. He was 77. A grandson of William Randolph Hearst, John R. Bunky Hearst, Jr., as he was called most of his life, served as a member of the company's Board of Directors for 44 years. He was appointed a trustee of The Hearst Family Trust in April 1972, the same year he joined the Hearst Foundations as a director. John was always very devoted to the company founded by his grandfather, said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., CEO of Hearst Corporation. He was equally devoted to a number of charitable organizations in the New York area. Those of us who served with him on the various Hearst Boards remember his great wit and interest in everything the company and Foundations were doing. Bunky will be greatly missed. Hearst enjoyed a long career with the Corporation, starting as a news photographer for the Hearst-owned New York Daily Mirror in the 1950s, as well as for the Hearst Newspapers division. In recognition of his interest in photojournalism, Hearst Newspapers commissioned a traveling trophy, the John R. Hearst Jr. Prize for Photo Excellence, awarded to photographers for Hearst Newspapers. An ardent boating enthusiast most of his life, he also served as an editor for Motor Boating & Sailing magazine, which was a Hearst publication. Born in New York City on December 8, 1933, to John Randolph Hearst, the third son of William Randolph Hearst, and Gretchen Wilson, Hearst often spent time in his youth at Hearst Castle in San Simeon, Calif., and greatly valued his time personally spent with his grandfather, the legendary W.R. Hearst. In 1960, John Hearst wrote an article for Reader's Digest entitled Life With Grandfather, in which he detailed their relationship. The younger Hearst's uncle, William Randolph Hearst, Jr., noted: The two talked newspapering a lot. Hearst said that if he learned one thing from his grandfather, it was the power of newspapers. Known for his sense of humor, Hearst enjoyed telling the story of how he had acquired his unusual nickname. He told the New York Times in 1983 that a cartoon character in his grandfather's newspaper, the New York Journal-American, was to blame. I used to wear huge baby bonnets, Hearst was quoted as saying. And my godfather took one look at me and said, He looks like Bunky in the funny papers.' The name stuck. On his 21st birthday, Hearst decided that he no longer resembled a Bunky, he told the Times. But it was too late; the nickname was his for life. I may as well wallow in it, Hearst said. Besides, I'd rather be a Bunky than a Junior. He is survived by his daughter Lisa Hearst Hagerman and his grandchildren, Tenney Hearst Espy, John Hearst Espy and Henry Hearst Hagerman. Services are pending. A memorial service will be announced at a later date. With appreciation, The Hearst Board of Directors"

She Chaired the Prints and Illustrated Books Committee (1973-1998), and served on the Executive Committee, the Development Committee, the House Committee, the Committees on Drawings, Film, Publications, Education, Archives and Exhibitions. Additionally, Joanne was the President of the International Council from 1971-86, and later served as a Vice Chairman and President Emerita. Her long time devotion was especially felt and warmly appreciated by the staff of the Department of Prints and Illustrated Books throughout her twenty-five year tenure as their Committee Chair. Her service on these committees and others was always exemplary and she brought a level of wit and dedication that will be sorely missed. In addition to her many commitments to MoMA, Joanne served on the Board of Trustees for the School of American Ballet, the Citizens Committee for Children, and the Visiting Committee for the Smith College Museum of Art. Additionally, Joanne was a trustee for the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation. We will miss not only her devotion to MoMA but we will miss her delightful stories about her years working as a photo editor for LOOK Magazine as well as her vast knowledge of and passion for the art world.

Mr. Bloomberg, in a speech in Washington at the liberal research group the Center for American Progress, said both parties were merely tinkering around the edges of a major problem that threatened the economy. He urged them to hammer out an agreement on spending cuts and tax increases to balance the budget in 10 years."
2011-11-09T00:00:00Z,"The popular perception is that the Green Bay Packers are great because of Aaron Rodgers and the passing offense. And for good reason: Rodgers (and by extension, the entire Green Bay passing offense) is on a record-breaking pace. Rodgers leads the league in completion percentage, touchdowns, touchdown percentage, yards per attempt, adjusted net yards per attempt and adjusted yards per attempt. He's averaging 11.2 adjusted yards per attempt, the highest mark after a team's first eight games of any quarterback in over 50 years. But did you know that the Packers rank 21st in pass attempts this season? I doubt that that jibes with your impression of the Packers as a passing team. The 2007 Patriots -- the year Tom Brady carved up opposing defenses nearly every week -- barely passed more frequently than the average team that season. The 1999 Rams won the Super Bowl and earned the nickname the Greatest Show on Turf, as Kurt Warner, Marshall Faulk, Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt led one of the great passing attacks in football history. That year, the Rams ranked 15th in the league in rush attempts and 19th in pass attempts. In all of these cases, the statistics did not tell the true story. Those teams passed so successfully that they frequently found themselves in run-favorable situations. Every N.F.L. fan knows that trailing teams tend to pass more frequently than winning teams, and the disparity is stronger the larger the lead or deficit. For example, teams this season are passing on 74 percent of plays when trailing by 17 to 24 points, but that drops to 44 percent when leading by such a margin. How a game unfolds has a large impact on the ultimate run/pass ratio of a team. To truly understand a team's offensive philosophy, you need to take into account the scoring flow of the game. I looked at the play-by-play logs of every game this season, courtesy of Footballguys.com. I excluded all plays in which a team was winning or losing by over 24 points because those plays reveal little about a team's gameplan (for example, the Colts called 23 pass plays and 23 runs in their 62-7 loss to the Saints; plays in those types of games are counted, but only until the games get out of hand). I also decided to exclude all rushing plays where the runner was the quarterback; many of those plays were probably designed pass plays, but others were designed runs or draws, along with quarterback sneaks and kneeldowns. Finally, I noted how much the team with the ball was leading or trailing by at the start of each play; that will help to give us a general sense of whether it is a passing or running situation. For example, when the Lions came back from a 20-point deficit against the Vikings, the average scoring margin on Detroit plays was -8.5; not surprisingly, the Lions passed on 74 percent of plays in that game (passing plays include sacks). This past weekend, the Texans jumped out to an early lead against the Browns. Houston's average offensive play was run with a 14.3-point lead; the Texans ran on 37 of 60 plays (this excludes the Matt Schaub touchdown run and his two kneeldowns at the end of the game). Both Arian Foster and Ben Tate rushed for over 100 yards. The table below shows the average scoring margin for each ''play'' by each team this season. Remember, the scoring margin excludes plays where a team has a lead of 25 points or more or trails by such a margin; it also excludes plays that end with the quarterback running. The table will loosely correlate with team strength, but there are several reasons (outside of the scope of this article) to hesitate before using these numbers as a sort of power ranking: [Note: All statistics in this article are from before the Monday Night Football game between the Bears and Eagles.] Team MarginHouston Texans 4.6Green Bay Packers 4.3Pittsburgh Steelers 3.9San Francisco 49ers 2.5Baltimore Ravens 2.5Philadelphia Eagles 2.1New England Patriots 1.9Chicago Bears 1.4Dallas Cowboys 1.2Atlanta Falcons 0.4Buffalo Bills 0.3Minnesota Vikings -0.1New Orleans Saints -0.5Tennessee Titans -0.6Detroit Lions -0.8Cincinnati Bengals -0.8New York Giants -1.1Oakland Raiders -1.3Carolina Panthers -1.8San Diego Chargers -1.9New York Jets -2.4Miami Dolphins -2.5Jacksonville Jaguars -2.8Arizona Cardinals -3.3Kansas City Chiefs -3.4Denver Broncos -3.8Washington Redskins -4.0Tampa Bay Buccaneers -5.0Indianapolis Colts -5.7Cleveland Browns -6.2Seattle Seahawks -6.8St Louis Rams -7.2 As you'd expect, the Packers have been in front most of the time this season. That helps explain why they haven't passed as frequently as you might think. As you can see, they rank just 13th in percentage of plays that were called passes: Team Margin Pass %Tampa Bay Buccaneers -5.0 68.4%Seattle Seahawks -6.8 67.7%Carolina Panthers -1.8 66.6%Detroit Lions -0.8 66.4%Washington Redskins -4.0 66.1%New Orleans Saints -0.5 65.9%Baltimore Ravens 2.5 64.5%St Louis Rams -7.2 64.5%Cleveland Browns -6.2 64.4%New England Patriots 1.9 64.3%Indianapolis Colts -5.7 63.9%Tennessee Titans -0.6 63.2%Green Bay Packers 4.3 62.9%Chicago Bears 1.4 62.8%Arizona Cardinals -3.3 62.8%Philadelphia Eagles 2.1 62.5%San Diego Chargers -1.9 61.4%Pittsburgh Steelers 3.9 61.2%Miami Dolphins -2.5 61.0%Dallas Cowboys 1.2 60.4%New York Giants -1.1 60.2%Atlanta Falcons 0.4 59.4%Buffalo Bills 0.3 59.0%New York Jets -2.4 58.8%Denver Broncos -3.8 58.4%Cincinnati Bengals -0.8 57.5%Oakland Raiders -1.3 54.2%Minnesota Vikings -0.1 53.8%Kansas City Chiefs -3.4 53.7%Jacksonville Jaguars -2.8 52.1%San Francisco 49ers 2.5 52.0%Houston Texans 4.6 50.9% So we know teams like the Steelers and the Packers have played with large leads, and pass more frequently than a team like the Texans. But how would we compare the 49ers to the Falcons? Or the Patriots to the Redskins? We need to convert ''margin'' and ''pass percentage'' to equivalent units. We can do that by looking at each team's standard deviation in each category. As you may recall from math class, standard deviation measures how spread out the observations are in a particular set of data. The actual standard deviations aren't all that interesting here, but the key is that by finding out how far from average (as measured by standard deviation) each team is in each category, we can get a true sense of offensive philosophy. On average, the 32 teams ran offensive plays while trailing by 1.2 points (we would expect the average to be negative, because teams kick off after a touchdown or field goal). The Texans were 1.8 standard deviations above average in the scoring margin category during Houston's average play; the Packers were 1.7 standard deviations above average, the Steelers 1.6, and so on. At the bottom of the list, of course, would be the Rams at -1.9 standard deviations from the average (taking the standard deviation won't change the order of the list; it simply measures the variance in the group.) What about in the pass percentage category? The average team passed on 61 percent of its plays, using the definition of plays from this article. The Bucs were 1.5 standard deviations above average in percentage of plays that were passed; the Texans were -2.1 standard deviations from the average. Once we have the ''margin'' category in the same unit as the ''pass percentage'' category, the rest of the math is easy. If a team has a low margin, that means it has frequently played from behind. If it is high in the pass percentage category, that means it tends to pass often. To measure how frequently a team passes after accounting for game situation, we simply add the standard deviation number in the margin category to the pass percentage standard deviation number. The table below presents the results. After the team name, the first two columns are just the earlier data reprinted. The next two columns show how many standard deviations above or below average each team was in scoring margin and percentage of passes called. Finally, the last column shows how pass-heavy the offense truly is, after adjusting for average scoring margin.

The Steelers and the Patriots are also in the top four, and the Saints are not far behind. Not surprisingly, the Jaguars and Chiefs lead the way when it comes to run-heavy offenses, regardless of situation. The Jets have actually been relatively run-heavy this season, but their game situation (trailing often) has somewhat distorted the numbers. Perhaps the most interesting team? The Ravens. A couple of weeks ago, Terrell Suggs said the Ravens needed to pass less and run more; it's hard to disagree with him. The Ravens have been extremely pass-heavy this season, once you factor in the game situation. Consider that against the Rams, when Baltimore raced out to a 21-0 lead before the first quarter ended, Joe Flaccothrew 48 passes while the running backs had just 17 carries. Suggs's comments came after the Jaguars loss, when Baltimore had 41 dropbacks against just 12 rushes in a game that was close throughout. Against the Steelers this weekend, Baltimore called 50 passing plays despite leading for a majority of the game.

2011-11-09T00:00:00Z,"HEARST--John Randolph, Jr.,A trustee of The Hearst Family Trust and a member of the Board of Directors of Hearst Corporation and the two Hearst Foundations, died November 4 in New York City. He was 77. A grandson of William Randolph Hearst, John R. Bunky Hearst, Jr., as he was called most of his life, served as a member of the company's Board of Directors for 44 years. He was appointed a trustee of The Hearst Family Trust in April 1972, the same year he joined the Hearst Foundations as a director. John was always very devoted to the company founded by his grandfather, said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., CEO of Hearst Corporation. He was equally devoted to a number of charitable organizations in the New York area. Those of us who served with him on the various Hearst Boards remember his great wit and interest in everything the company and Foundations were doing. Bunky will be greatly missed. Hearst enjoyed a long career with the Corporation, starting as a news photographer for the Hearst-owned New York Daily Mirror in the 1950s, as well as for the Hearst Newspapers division. In recognition of his interest in photojournalism, Hearst Newspapers commissioned a traveling trophy, the John R. Hearst Jr. Prize for Photo Excellence, awarded to photographers for Hearst Newspapers. An ardent boating enthusiast most of his life, he also served as an editor for Motor Boating & Sailing magazine, which was a Hearst publication. Born in New York City on December 8, 1933, to John Randolph Hearst, the third son of William Randolph Hearst, and Gretchen Wilson, Hearst often spent time in his youth at Hearst Castle in San Simeon, Calif., and greatly valued his time personally spent with his grandfather, the legendary W.R. Hearst. In 1960, John Hearst wrote an article for Reader's Digest entitled Life With Grandfather, in which he detailed their relationship. The younger Hearst's uncle, William Randolph Hearst, Jr., noted: The two talked newspapering a lot. Hearst said that if he learned one thing from his grandfather, it was the power of newspapers. Known for his sense of humor, Hearst enjoyed telling the story of how he had acquired his unusual nickname. He told the New York Times in 1983 that a cartoon character in his grandfather's newspaper, the New York Journal-American, was to blame. I used to wear huge baby bonnets, Hearst was quoted as saying. And my godfather took one look at me and said, He looks like Bunky in the funny papers.' The name stuck. On his 21st birthday, Hearst decided that he no longer resembled a Bunky, he told the Times. But it was too late; the nickname was his for life. I may as well wallow in it, Hearst said. Besides, I'd rather be a Bunky than a Junior. He is survived by his daughter Lisa Hearst Hagerman and his grandchildren, Tenney Hearst Espy, John Hearst Espy and Henry Hearst Hagerman. Services are pending. A memorial service will be announced at a later date. With appreciation, The Hearst Board of Directors"

2011-11-10T15:00:08Z,"There aren't many film stars who, entering their golden years, endure as icons of sensuality. Charlotte Rampling, 65 years old and un-retouched (both on screen and in real life), is one of them. The daughter of a British colonel and NATO commander, Rampling attended tony girls' schools in France and England. She modeled briefly, before trying films, and burst onto the scene in ""Georgy Girl"" (1966), in which she played a flirt who is the embodiment of Swinging London. Today, after five decades on screen (including a star turn in Visconti's classic, ""The Damned""), and modeling for everyone from Helmut Newton to Juergen Teller, Rampling's career shows no signs of abating. In ""The Mill and the Cross"" (currently in theaters), the Polish director Lech Majewski's visually ravishing examination of a Breugel painting, she takes on the Virgin Mary; in ""Melancholia"" (opening Friday), the bad-boy Danish director Lars von Trier's latest, her character is based upon von Trier's despised mother. And in the fashion world, Rampling continues to inspire: Marc Jacobs designed much of his fall 2011 collection for Louis Vuitton after her role in ""The Night Porter"" (1974), Liliana Calvani's controversial, S&M-infused drama about a death-camp survivor's affair with a Nazi officer (think: leather caps and suspenders)."

When the Board of Trustees did the right thing Wednesday night -- and really, firing Paterno and Graham B.

2011-11-10T09:00:59Z,"Talk about a makeover. Among the latest offerings at the SoHo design mecca Moss is this pair of vintage Eames Lounge Chairs, which Murray Moss decided to re-cover in Hella Jongerius's Repeat Dot fabric from Maharam. The chairs (which have been manufactured by Herman Miller since 1956) have a built-in pedigree because they're made with Brazilian rosewood veneer, the material that was originally specified by Charles and Ray Eames, but which was discontinued in 1992 when Brazilian rosewood landed on the endangered species list. Jongerius's eye-popping fabric, however, is what really makes them - it takes a design icon from the ""Mad Men"" era and catapults it into the 21st century. (As with many Moss creations, these don't come cheap: the chairs are $16,000 each, or $30,000 for the pair.) They're just the first (or first two) in a planned series of one-off furniture pieces on which Moss and Maharam will collaborate. And for a glimpse of what other designs Maharam might bring to the project, see ""Maharam Agenda"" (Lars Müller Publishers), a new book on the innovative textile company by Michael Maharam, who has run the family-owned business with his brother, Stephen, since 1997. The book not only describes the brothers' risk-taking design agenda, but it looks like an agenda, too, complete with a soft cover (an embroidered design by Jongerius) and woven bookmark - a tip-off right there that this isn't going to be your average corporate coffee-table book."

2011-11-10T00:00:00Z,"Last week, we profiled a dilemma facing J. Hilburn, a Dallas clothing company that uses direct sales and multilevel marketing to sell custom shirts and other menswear. Founded in 2007 by Hil Davis and Veeral Rathod, two Dallas financial industry workers, the company's sales rose from $1 million in 2008 to $3.25 million in 2009 and $8 million in 2010, a year in which it sold 60,000 shirts (starting at $89). As Mr. Davis and Mr. Rathod built their business, they knew they would have to raise money. They wanted to expand the business with an Internet sales channel, and they needed to build their inventory. But as they went about raising capital, they discovered a problem: potential investors questioned their vision for a company that would blend direct sales with an online channel. Direct sales suffered from a historically dodgy reputation, for one thing, and the blend did not have the sizzle of a pure Internet strategy. Of those investors who were interested, some looked at the Internet channel as a way for the company to increase sales while eliminating - or at least cutting - the commissions paid to the direct-sales reps, something Mr. Davis and Mr. Rathod thought would alienate the people who had helped them build the business. And then there was the problem of how to integrate a direct-sales force with an Internet sales channel, not something commonly done in the retail world."

Some shell-shocked employees began to quit, and Ms. Reiniger was forced to lay off others. She was soon down to two employees from a high of 25.

Barnes (1872-1951), above, a chemist who made a fortune by developing an antiseptic drug. Barnes stipulated that the European masterworks, African sculptures, Asian prints and American Indian ceramics valued at more than $25 billion that he amassed should remain in their original locale, far from the urban elite he despised. ''Money, power, race, a mansion stuffed with treasure, a city plagued by scandal -- about all that's missing from 'The Art of the Steal,' a hard-hitting documentary about a high-cultural brawl, is a hot woman with a warm gun,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. She added: ''At times the fight comes across as a smackdown between art snobs who want to preserve Barnes's right to exhibit his masterworks however he wanted because, well, he paid for them (a curiously underexamined refrain), and vulgarians who want to turn his patrimony into tourist bait along with the Liberty Bell and an actor in a Ben Franklin getup. What remains unanswered, finally, is the larger question of whether deep pockets ensure custodial rights forever.''

With the singularity of purpose that an intelligence officer brings to an interrogation room, Ronen Bergman has powerfully illuminated the past and present of Israeli prisoner exchanges, focusing on the recent swap of 1,027 Palestinians for a single Israeli soldier named Gilad Shalit. How can such a deal be justified in a nation that prides itself on not negotiating with terrorists? What about the citizens who've been killed and maimed by those now being freed? These are the questions that drive Bergman's story."

The move will save on production costs and fees paid to guest conductors, said David J. Hyslop, the orchestra's interim president and chief operating officer. The orchestra's musicians have agreed to forgo wages increases for the past two seasons and agreed to a wage freeze for this season and next, reflecting the same straitened circumstances experienced by many orchestras around the country. Mr. Hyslop said the orchestra has projected a $6.5 million budget deficit this season, but after an emergency appeal for donations to the board on Tuesday and the cost-cutting steps, that number should drop."

We have now endured over a half-decade of laments about how a team that routinely wins 11 to 16 games per year is not what it used to be, simultaneously criticizing Bill Belichick for his recent personnel decisions and genuflecting before the altar of his past accomplishments.

Unless you are a lifelong Jets or Patriots fan, you feel you have been clamped to your seat, eyelids taped open, neck immobilized and forced to watch.

(Showtime) THE LAST PLAY AT SHEA (2010) The histories of Shea Stadium, the Mets, Billy Joel (above) and New York City itself across four and a half decades intersect in this documentary from Paul Crowder, which focuses on Mr. Joel's concerts on July 16 and July 18, 2008 -- the last performances given in the stadium, which was torn down the next year. '' 'The Last Play at Shea' has a built-in happy ending that is almost too good to be true,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, discussing the sudden appearance of Paul McCartney. ''For the July 18 concert, Mr. McCartney miraculously appeared, having been whisked through customs at Kennedy International Airport after a flight from London that had been allowed to land early. He was sped to the stadium by a motorcade in 11 minutes and driven onto the field in time to perform by Pete Flynn, the dedicated groundskeeper who had driven the Beatles to the same stage 43 years earlier,'' on Aug. 15, 1965. Mr. Holden added: '' 'If it weren't for the Beatles,' Mr. Joel declares, 'I wouldn't do what I do.' Call it perfect symmetry. The final number, 'Let It Be,' rings as a sweet valedictory to all the struggle, the teamwork and the glory captured in this wonderful film.'' 8 P.M.

Vita Petersen was an abstract expressionist painter and part of the New York circle of artists that included Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Hedda Sterne among others. She was a friend of Mercedes Matter with whom she started the New York Studio School and where she remained Trustee and member of the board of governors until her death at 96 on October 22 at her home in Manhattan. She remained fiercely involved with the students until the end. Born in 1915 in Berlin to a family prominent in German history, her father was German Secretary of State in the 1920s; her mother was a descendant of Moses Mendelssohn. Vita fled the Nazis, in 1938 emigrating to New York with her husband Gustav Petersen to whom she was married for 60 years until his death on October 19, 2002. She began art school at 16 when Max Liebermann, the internationally known artist told her reluctant parents: ""Any blind person with a crutch can see she has talent,"" In New York she studied with Hans Hofmann and exhibited in Berlin and New York at the Stable Gallery and the Betty Parsons Gallery, among others. She had her last solo show when she was 94 Inventive to the end, even as her eyesight dimmed, she changed to black and white from her earlier color. These last paintings, considered some of her finest work will be exhibited this winter. Her ability to grow and experiment was an inspiration to the large number of young artists who constantly sought her advice. She is survived by her daughter Andrea Petersen, granddaughter Jessica Chermayeff, son-in-law Peter Chermayeff, nephews Ernest von Simson and Wolfgang Traber, and a large and loving group of extended family and friends. The family is planning a memorial at the New York Studio School at 2pm on January 29."

2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"High in the White Mountains of eastern California is a forest of trees that are among the oldest living things on earth. The Great Basin bristlecone pines are so ghostly, gnarled and ashen that they almost look their age: some trees are nearly 5,000 years old. The bristlecone pine thrives where almost nothing else does, in high-altitude ranges in California, Nevada and Utah. Their wood is so dense and full of resin that they are protected from insects and diseases that would easily kill other trees. (Even mighty California redwoods don't live beyond 2,000 years.) The rings of the bristlecones are startlingly accurate, preserving records of volcanic eruptions and celestial events (like meteor showers) and even helping scientists improve their estimates of historical events. The patriarch of the bristlecones -- known as Methuselah -- is older than the Great Pyramid of Giza. (The Methuselah Grove is accessible to hikers, but the tree itself is unmarked.) Yet for all their longevity, they are not invincible. The leading cause of death of ancient bristlecones, said Adelia Barber, a researcher at U.C. Santa Cruz, is fire. ''Some can survive lightning strikes,'' she said. ''But ultimately lightning sets the trees on fire, and they die.'' Maximum height of bristlecone pine: about 30 feet"

2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"Patriots (5-3) at Jets (5-3) Sunday, 8:20 p.m. Line: Jets by 1 .5. The seventh annual Patriots Dynasty Deathwatch is under way. The team has lost two straight games, prompting the usual hand-wringing about eras ending and la belle epoque coming to a melancholy fin. We have now endured over a half-decade of laments about how a team that routinely wins 11 to 16 games per year is not what it used to be, simultaneously criticizing Bill Belichick for his recent personnel decisions and genuflecting before the altar of his past accomplishments. No wonder otherwise sane people ardently root against this team. The Patriots' need to prolong their dramatic swoon to William Shatner lengths, coupled with the usual noisy Jets' chest thumping, has turned this into the most torturously overblown rivalry in the N.F.L. Unless you are a lifelong Jets or Patriots fan, you feel you have been clamped to your seat, eyelids taped open, neck immobilized and forced to watch. It's less a battle of two great teams (both are highly flawed this season) than a battle of attention hounds of differing styles. The Jets should win easily - the Patriots have only one starting-caliber cornerback to handle three very good Jets receivers - but ''let us again bid fond farewell to the glorious Patriots'' conversations that will dominate the following week make it almost not worth the trouble. Pick: Jets. Lions (6-2) at Bears (5-3) Sunday, 4:15 p.m. Line: Bears by 2.5 . Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh had a private meeting with Commissioner Roger Goodell on Nov. 1 in which Goodell reportedly clarified the N.F.L.'s rules regarding unnecessary roughness. Suh was later seen walking down Park Avenue with his hair singed and pupils dilated, like Charlton Heston coming down from Mount Sinai in ''The Ten Commandments.'' Suh is now the only person on earth who understands the N.F.L.'s rules regarding unnecessary roughness. Apparently, it is not some arbitrary foul based upon a referee's personal interpretation of unenforceable, over-legislated mandates, sometimes coaxed by convincing method writhing by the quarterback. It only appears that way to the unenlightened. Goodell should meet with all of us, one by one, until everyone understands: the guy who runs your fantasy league next week, then Brian Baldinger, then finally Michael Vick, who will learn about the exceptions that apply only to him. The Suh summit was well timed: the Bears and the Lions combined for 26 penalties in their October meeting, a few of them caused by the exuberance of Suh's teammates and Jay Cutler's pro wrestling reaction to every brush on the elbow. The Bears' offensive line has solidified since that penalty-marred mess, but if Suh spreads his message of peace to his teammates, the Bears will not benefit from the 15-yard freebies the Lions have been handing out all year. Pick: Lions."

Born in New York on May 20, 1915, with husband Charles and her mother Peggy Stauble she was one of the original tenants of Peter Cooper Village. Her husband, who served in the Army in Europe during World War II, receiving a bronze star, and who was thereafter with the Pentagon, had joined administrative staff at the United Nations. After his premature death in 1966, and her mother's soon after, she devoted her life to good works, including reading to the blind. A devout member of the Parish of Calvary St. George's, she was honored there in 2009 for long service on the Altar Guild, the Thrift Shop Board, and the telephone ministry. She then relocated to Maine to Huntington Common Retirement Community to be near family. She expressed deep satisfaction with the richness of her 96 years. Following retirement from many years in executive positions, notably with American Thread Company and with Jenkins Brothers, she travelled widely, from China to England, where she as Anglophile could trace maternal Moore family roots to before the time of King Henry VIII. Special memories included childhood visits to her paternal grandfather's farm near Hurley, NY. She loved time with family and her large circle of cherished friends, who have the legacy of her grace, intelligence, elegance, compassionate generosity, and enthusiastic engagement with life and lifelong learning. She is survived by nephews Carl Anderson of Mt. Bethel, PA, and Ralph Anderson of Annapolis, MD; by nieces Elsa van Bergen of Scarborough and Kennebunk, ME, and Darlene DeMarsico, of Brooklyn, NY; by grandnephews and a grandniece; and by several cousins.

You'll have to fight your way through the crowds -- the small, handsome beach is one of Tobago's most popular -- and wave off all manner of vendor: Boat ride? Aloe vera massage? Bob Marley magnet? Head to the food stalls at the back edge of the beach. The reward is that first bite. Store Bay sells some of the most delicious food on the island, no small feat considering how seriously Tobago takes its cuisine, a mélange of African and East Indian flavors. At Miss Trim's or Miss Jean's stalls, order crab and hefty flour dumplings in curried coconut milk sauce. Leave room fora roti, a sort of curried burrito filled with potatoes, yam and anything from conch to goat; order it ''buss-up-shot''-style and you'll get a plate of fillings with shredded roti skin for dipping. There's coocoo and callaloo, polenta slices smothered in spinach-like soup, and pelau, a stew of rice, pigeon peas, coconut milk and hunks of sugar-seared meats. Corn soup is thick and filling; so is the cow heel soup, usually brimming with ground vegetables like dasheen root, cassava and yam that have long been a staple here. Get dessert to go: bene balls -- sesame seeds congealed with molasses -- and mango or pineapple marinated in spicy pepper sauces and sold in little baggies, perfect for carrying home as a sweet souvenir."

Or ''Walking Dead''? You know, to make ''Breaking Dawn''? [Correct answer: ''Twilight,'' ''New Moon,'' ''Eclipse,'' ''Breaking Dawn.''] You might be. Who plays Edward Cullen? Oh! It's that pale kid. Possibly -- is his name Justin? [Correct answer: Robert Pattinson.] Why is Alice in a mental institution? Something about her being pregnant with a vampire baby. [Correct answer: She was having visions of the future.] What are the people in the diner thinking about when Edward reads their minds? How pale he is. [Correct answer: Money, sex and, in one case, a cat.] Who is Jacob? Jacob is a sexy werewolf! [Correct answer: Sexy werewolf.] Everyone knows that one. Yeah! Because of the whole Team Edward vs. Team Jacob thing. Also, Jacob reminds me of Anthony Kiedis in the ''Under the Bridge'' video. Why don't the Cullens eat people? Maybe a person was nice to them once and so they're mainstreamers, like in ''True Blood'' or ''Buffy''? Wait, is Edward's last name Cohen? [Correct answer: They're ''vegetarian'' vampires. They eat animals instead.] Cohen? No. Cullen. With an ''l.' 'Oh, I was going to say maybe it's not kosher. What happens to Twilight vampires in the sun? They're very shiny? They look like marble, like the Lincoln memorial. [Correct answer: They sparkle.] What human sport do vampires play? Lacrosse. Because they're European. [Correct answer: Baseball.] Team Edward or Team Jacob and why? Team Jacob because all of Edward's weird, sappy, sad, virginy, purity, shiny crap is crap. My pro-Jacob stance is at heart an anti-Edward stance."

After all, he's said to have written those lyrics from the terrace of his vacation home in Montego Bay, where he and his wife, Dorothy, hosted lavish dinner parties for the likes of Noël Coward and Richard Burton. His former home is now Highland House, a six-bedroom, fully staffed villa nestled in the rugged mountains above Montego Bay -- and offering a dazzling vista of sea, city lights and lush greenery. The current owner, Brenda Isaacs, meticulously restored the property, merging the past with a New Age present. Much of Dorothy Hammerstein's period furniture remains, but a grand sapphire-colored Buddha now presides over the terrace, and luxurious accommodations like the Zen Room feature four-poster beds and Deco-style décor. The spirituality isn't just aesthetic: Ms. Isaacs runs the One Love Learning Foundation, a partnership between a nearby school and schools in Atlanta and South Africa. Guests at the villa can join her effort by working on the villa's grounds -- 17 acres chockablock with mango trees, papaya groves and an organic vegetable garden -- and personally donating their crop to local schools and orphanages.

To those less inured, though, the string of islands between Trinidad and Venezuela will elicit more dramatic reactions. Not only are they a nature-lover's gem -- full of jagged limestone, lush flora, immaculate beaches and neon birds -- they're also brimming with historical remains. You'll marvel at how much history -- from the Amerindian migration from South America, to pirate legacies, Spanish colonization and beyond -- are crammed into so few square miles. Hop on a private speedboat (or one run by local tour companies) and cruise first to the Bocas, a 20-minute ride from northern Trinidad. On the largest of them, Chacachacare, glimpse a tall lighthouse, along with remnants of sundry incarnations: cotton plantation, whaling station, leper colony and, during World War Two, a United States Marine base. Sail on to Monos to spy red howler monkeys, then to Gaspar Grande to explore limestone caves and to relax on Bombshell Bay. The Five Islands are actually six, with Nelson Island most noteworthy. It's an Ellis Island of sorts, embarkation point for indentured laborers from India and China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Devote time to simply enjoying the ride; many companies are equipped with snorkeling and water-skiing equipment, and all stock Carib beers.

Was that the same Marshawn Lynch who ran for just 24 yards on 16 carries a week earlier against the Bengals? Let's not get too carried away here. Lynch has been way too inconsistent to be considered a top-rate fantasy running back going forward and he is among our unfavorable matchup picks in Week 10 against Baltimore's third-ranked run defense."
2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"One does not ''party'' in Trinidad, home to the biggest annual carnival in the Caribbean. Instead, one engages in ''liming'': a form of recreation that involves robust quantities of alcohol, droll repartee, frenetic music and, when the tempo demands, equally frenetic dancing. Perfect the art of liming at Smokey & Bunty, a 22-year-old institution in the lively St. James area of Port of Spain, Trinidad's night-life-heavy capital. Locals flock to the place at all hours of the day. Nary is the Trinidadian who has not at some point in her liming career ordered a Stag beer or Johnny Walker and coconut water there, then settled into an outdoor table to chat the night away (inside by the bar, blaring soca tunes -- the irrefutably catchy, ultra- fast-paced music of carnival -- make chitchat a futile endeavor). Yes, there will likely be at least one disorderly customer at some point in the evening, and no, you can't get fancy cocktails. But you can cross the street and order a supremely fresh roti from the woman making them by hand on the same corner she's been on for years.

2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"There was an interesting bit of news Friday for the United States men's national team after another goalless outing in an international friendly - it will face a regional minnow, Antigua and Barbuda, when the Americans begin play next June in World Cup qualifying matches in the Concacaf region. With a game to go in the second round of regional qualifying, Antigua and Barbuda (Spanish for ancient and bearded) clinched a spot in the next round with a 1-0 win over visiting Haiti in St. John's, the capital of the two-island nation that lies southeast of Puerto Rico. Jamaica and Guatemala, which also locked down a spot in the next round on Friday, will also be in the qualifying group with the United States. The next round of qualifying in Concacaf consists of three groups of four teams. Games in the third round will be completed in the autumn of 2012. The top two teams in each group advance to the final six-nation qualifying round, which has come to be known as the hexagonal, with play starting early in 2013. The top three finishers earn automatic berths in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, with the fourth-place team entering a playoff against the winner of the Oceania region, which is likely to be New Zealand. According to the FIFA calendar, the dates for international matches next year are: June 1-5, June 8-12, Sept. 7-11 and Oct. 12-16. The United States' 1-0 loss to France on Friday was already hours old when Antigua and Barbuda (population about 89,000) took the field against Haiti, which could have taken over the group lead with a victory. In a nation where cricket is the most popular sport (the match was played at the cricket stadium, which hosted Cricket World Cup matches in 2007), the 30-year-old midfielder Kerry Skepple, who has played in Finland, scored the game's only goal with eight minutes left in the match. The other three teams in the third round's Group A are most likely already counting on taking 6 points from their two matches (home and home) against the Antiguans. In fact, the composition of all three groups in the third round was settled Friday, with one match day still to be completed. In Group B, El Salvador and surprising Guyana (which is on the South American continent) advanced and join Mexico and Costa Rica. Guyana's upset of Trinidad and Tobago brought to a close a year of soccer turmoil in Trinidad and Tobago: one of the country's most powerful men, Jack Warner, was implicated in a bribery scandal and resigned his positions with FIFA and Concacaf. In Group C, Canada and Panama advanced and will play Honduras and Cuba in the next round. Canada traveled to St. Kitts and Nevis for Friday's game, coming away with a point after a 0-0 tie. ''We knew they needed the 3 points and that they would come out and go for it,'' Canada Coach Stephen Hart told FIFA.com. ''We came here and we knew we had to get a point by playing a road style and we got that, so all in all we're O.K.'' Canada has not played in the World Cup since 1986. Haiti played in the 1974 World Cup in West Germany, and Trinidad and Tobago appeared in the 2006 tournament in Germany. Who do you think has the clearest path to the next round? Canada is in a difficult group with three Latin nations, while the U.S. will face two Caribbean countries. Do we hear road trip? This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"As the beaches south of Cancún become ever more crowded with sprawling resorts, it's getting harder to find a quiet stretch of sand, much less an intimate beachfront inn with fewer than 100 rooms. Which is what makes Hotel Le Rêve, a 25-room boutique hotel about 45 minutes south of Cancún, so special. The chic three-story whitewashed hotel, with its thatched roof and zigzagging infinity pool, draws its share of casual gawkers from nearby all-inclusive resorts -- marked by their plastic wristbands -- who tend to slow down as they stroll past on the beach. Unlike some of its boisterous family-oriented neighbors, Le Rêve caters to grown-ups looking for romance and relaxation. Minimalist rooms accented by dark wood furnishings and hand-painted Mexican tiles have no televisions. Bungalows with mini-infinity pools offer unobscured ocean views. Stake out a white-cushioned lounge chair by the blue-tiled pool and order a drink from the bar. Or grab a book and head for one of the hammocks strung between palm trees on the beach. Rates start at $219 a night, but can often be had for less through online promotions. Hotel Le Rêve, Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, Mexico; hotellereve.com."

2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"The name alone confounds, leaping out from a 1950s-looking billboard along a quiet stretch of road in St. Martin. Is Boo Boo Jam a cartoon character, you might wonder. A term of endearment? In fact, it's a beach bar, a fairly unremarkable one at that, on a tourist-friendly island teeming with flawless beaches and modern amenities. But on weekend nights, the Boo Boo Jam transforms into the ultimate French Caribbean dance party -- a down-home scene that stands in stark contrast to the glitzy nightclubs and frat-style bars on the more commercial Dutch side of the island. The party started in 1995, when Hurricane Luis struck the island and only a few properties were prepared with generators. The Boo Boo Jam was one of them; its owners decided to seize the opportunity, turn up the music and stay open late on Fridays. The crowds came, and they still do: sipping Haitian rum, chatting in French and dancing cheek-to-cheek to the tinny rhythms of compas music. Then the tempo changes and uptempo zouk music livens up the dance floor. The fete lasts until the wee hours, when the woman peddling fish tea in a little booth outside the party has emptied her pot, and a sliver of sun gently emerges over the Caribbean. Boo Boo Jam Orient Bay; (1721) 554-4670."

At his death, Mr. Russell was President of James Russell Engineering, an innovative, world-class producer of compressed gas trailers and cryogenic engineering technology. Mr. Russell was also a founding partner of Thermax, Inc., an important manufacturer of vaporizers and other related products. Aside from his work and his family, Mr. Russell's interests were broadly divided into boats and books. He was the ""powerplant"" of the 1949 Yale crew that shocked Harvard (ending 14 consecutive Crimson victories in the Harvard-Yale Regatta) and set a course record that lasted for decades. The previous year, Mr. Russell had narrowly missed qualifying for the U.S. Olympic rowing team. Moreover, Mr. Russell was also a successful sailor in the Wianno Senior class, competing out of Cotuit, Massachusetts, where he maintained a summer house. A graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, Yale University and a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Russell pursued his passion for learning, reading and discussing history and politics to the end of his life. His interests ranged from the ancient civilizations of the near East to the writings of Sun Tzu and the films of Kurosawa, from the military history of World War Two to the essays and fiction of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. He also served in U.S. Army Counter-Intelligence from 1952 to 1955 and was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon. He is survived by Katherine Wehmann Russell, his wife of 56 years; his children Dr. Warren King Russell II, Elizabeth Suzanne Russell, Margaret Warburg and Richard Andrew Russell; as well as seven grandchildren, one great-grandchild, and his beloved dog, ""Dude.""

2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"For some fans of Antoni Gaudí, the towers going up at the World Trade Center site are a sad reminder of what might have been. The Catalan architect may be best known for Barcelona's Sagrada Família, a neo-gothic cathedral that looks as if it's melting, but in 1908 he designed a pearlescent, glass-studded spaceship of a hotel, which would at that time have been the world's tallest building, for the site that is now ground zero. Although it's unclear whether construction of such a skyscraper was feasible then, Hotel Attraction was intended to rise almost as high as the Empire State Building would 23 years later. In 2003, Spanish artists advocated building it as a 9/11 memorial and a ''present from Barcelona, like the Statue of Liberty.'' An American architect, Paul Laffoley, joined the campaign, saying the hotel could become the New York symbol Gaudí intended."

Many who live on the streets still redeem cans and bottles at grocery stores, but in parts of Lower Manhattan, the most prominent collectors are not without homes. They are older Chinese men and women, who often haul immense loads of plastic, aluminum and glass through the streets. For these collectors, most of them recent immigrants with little command of English, recycling, an underground economy in a city of plenty, is a source of income that is not contingent on citizenship.

2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"LAST year I had to have a minor biopsy. Every time I went in for an appointment, I had to fill out a form requiring my name, address, insurance information, emergency contact person, vaccination history, previous surgical history and current medical problems, medications and allergies. I must have done it four times in just three days. Then, after my procedure, I received bills -- and, even more annoying, statements of charges that said they weren't bills -- almost daily, from the hospital, the surgeon, the primary care doctor, the insurance company. Imagine that repeated millions of times daily and you have one of the biggest money wasters in our health care system. Administration accounts for roughly 14 percent of what the United States spends on health care, or about $360 billion per year. About half of all administrative costs -- $163 billion in 2009 -- are borne by Medicare, Medicaid and insurance companies. The other half pays for the legions employed by doctors and hospitals to fill out billing forms, keep records, apply for credentials and perform the myriad other administrative functions associated with health care."

2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"FLYNN--C. Peter, an experimental physicist at the University of Illinois and father of four passed away on October 27, 2011. Colin Peter Flynn was born in Stockton-on-Tees, a small market town in North Yorkshire, England on August 18, 1935. He was the son of Francis Johnson Flynn, a police constable in the village of Hovingham, and his wife, Edith Hannah, a local war-time nurse. At the age of 17, Peter was awarded a full scholarship to the University of Leeds where he received his bachelor's degree and, at the age of 24, his Ph.D. in Physics. In 1960, Peter moved to the United States to take a post-doctoral position with the Physics Department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. A distinguished experimentalist, Peter spent 51 years at the University, authoring more than 260 peer-reviewed articles, supervising 31 Ph.D. students and serving as the Director of the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory for nearly a decade. He made seminal contributions to several areas of condensed matter physics. In the 1960s, he utilized magnetic resonance imaging to pursue a fundamental study of the behavior and motion of defects and impurities in solids, an effort that culminated in his 1972 book, ""Point Defects and Diffusion"", still the definitive source in this field. In the 1990s, he spearheaded the University's acquisition, installation and modification of a low-energy electron microscope (""LEEM"") to image real-time changes in atomically clean surfaces, atom-surface interactions, and thin (crystalline) films. He used this tool to research the behavior and motion of surface atoms in crystalline structures in order to further advance the study of surface energetics. As part of his research on the LEEM, he also pioneered the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) method of growing metallic superlattices which allows researchers to construct ultra-pure structures down to the level of a single atomic layer. To this day, the LEEM at the University of Illinois is one of only a handful of LEEMs operational in the United States. He was a Fellow of both the American Physical Society and of the American Society of Metals, and held a Fellowship at Christ's College, Cambridge, U.K. from 1966 to 1967. In addition to his passion for physics, Peter was a voracious reader and engaged in a rich variety of activities including home building projects, hiking the American West and sports such as tennis, squash and golf. Peter's steady optimism and dedication to an energetic life filled with joyful and serious pursuits will continue to inspire all of those who knew him. Peter is survived by his wife, Janice; son Jim, his wife Kerianne, and their son Declan; son Derek, his wife Elizabeth, and their two children Alice and John; daughter Megan; son John, his fiancee Alix; and sister, Joan. We will all miss Peter's love and guidance."
2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"Dieppe Bay is a sliver of a town on St. Kitts's northern tip. The oldest European settlement in the Eastern Caribbean -- colonized in 1538 by French Huguenots fleeing religious prosecution -- it was the capital of the French-ruled northern part of the island until 1713, when Britain extended its reach over all of St. Kitts. Today the fishing village's legacy lives in the cut-stone structures and ruined walls that stand alongside charming shuttered homes dating back more than two centuries. It doesn't take a history buff, though, to relish Dieppe Bay's volcanic black sand beach, well worth the 40-minute drive from the more commercial south of the island. Protected by a fertile reef, the sea here is calm and the snorkeling, sublime. Views of neighboring Saba and St. Eustatius, rising like volcanoes in the sea, serve as backdrop.

2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"VOLCKHAUSEN--June MacLean, died on October 9, 2011 at 97 years of age in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, the eldest of three daughters of Viola Pratt MacLean and Waldo Bross MacLean. After graduating from Sarah Lawrence College she worked as a reporter for the White Plaines Reporter Dispatch, did publicity work for the United Cerebral Palsy Association, Westchester County Hospital, and feature stories. Her poetry is published in the Connecticut Review. Her grandfather, Willis C. Pratt who lived to be 100, was a reporter and city editor for the New York Evening Mail and Express, and writer for the World, Herald and Times. He was friends with Teddy Roosevelt, Henry Ford and Mark Twain. Mrs. Volckhausen was an activist who was ahead of her generation in championing social issues: civil rights, nuclear freeze, League of Women Voters, Planned Parenthood and conservation. With her husband of 53 years, George W. Volckhausen, (1910-'92), she helped found two Unitarian fellowships in Devon, Pennsylvania and Ridgefield, Connecticut. Mrs. Volckhausen inherited her love of music from her mother. As a supporter of the arts she passed her musical talent to her son, a Julliard graduate, pianist and professor at Manhattan School of Music and her grand-daughter, whose band has performed nationally. Her passion for social action is carried on by her daughter, a social worker. June Volckhausen is survived by her daughter Lynn Volckhausen Edinoff, son-in-law Stuart Edinoff (Ft. Lauderdale); son David Volckhausen (Somers, NY); granddaughter Ellie Volckhausen (Boston); and six nieces and nephews. Donations appreciated: Unitarian Universalist Society, National Public Radio, The Nature Conservancy, Hospice-By-the-Sea in Boca Raton, Florida.

2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"INTERVIEWS BY ALEXANDRA WOLFE Tara Wixom, 14: I think of the Purity Ball at the Evangelical Free Church as something I go to yearly to remind myself of the commitment I have made to keep myself pure -- physically, morally, sexually -- until I am married. What I really like about my father going is that he is the one that God has put at the head of our household. I'm preparing myself for when I am married, so I think you could call my dad my guinea pig. I'm learning how to serve, respect, love, honor my husband. I practice that by loving, serving and obeying my father. The first year I went, my dad gave me a necklace. This year, he gave me a purity ring, which I wear on my left hand. It is also a reminder. Alexis Wixom, 12: We said that we love each other. I was thinking that I was saving my purity for my husband. Brenden Wixom: When the three of us were dancing together, I was thinking that not too long ago, they were just toddlers and now they're young women. You kind of want time to slow down and be able to relish the moment. We send our kids out into the world, and there's a battle going on. It seemed like a good idea to give the girls a biblical worldview and help them make a commitment to how they want their life to unfold before a precipitous moment happens. They know about the birds and the bees, but they're still fairly innocent. When they go to the ball for the first time, it's a commitment to remain pure and an understanding that it's not going to be easy. In subsequent years, it's about recommitting and taking stock of where they're at and asking their father for support. That evening, I was thinking about how I see things accelerating so quickly. That also brings with it a sense of urgency: you want your children, and particularly your daughters, to be prepared."
2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"Consider it a vacation from your vacation: an island off an island, where the only thing to do is eat lobster, drink wine and swim in warm azure waters. Just off the French side of St. Martin, the petite island of Pinel is rumored to have acquired its name from a Portuguese captain (the word is Portuguese for ''crazy'') in the days when it housed St. Martin's mentally ill. Nowadays what's ''crazy'' about Pinel are the American tourists who elect not to go; this gem of a mini-island is favored by locals and in-the-know French expats. Access is via kayaks or speedboats ($10 round trip) from the charming Cul de Sac area of St. Martin, which -- with its rolling hills and green-and pink-roofed cottages -- is a dead ringer for St. Bart's. Once across, rent a beach chair alongside scantily clad French sunbathers and order the Camembert, served hot, with baguettes for dipping. Or pull up a table at one of Pinel's three restaurants: Le Kariabuni, specializing in lobster; the Yellow Beach, a down-home barbecue joint; or Up on the Key, where the burgers ($10) and tequila-spiked shrimp ($18) go down easy. If doing absolutely nothing grows too taxing, there's always snorkeling, hiking or shopping for shell jewelry and colorful wraps at the Paradiso Gift Shop. The last boat back to the mainland departs at 5 -- when it's time to return, alas, to your regularly scheduled vacation. visitpinel.com."

2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"Jamaica has no shortage of sublimely beautiful, impeccably maintained beaches. Hellshire isn't one of them. Sure, its sea strikes a luscious shade of blue and its sand is powdery white. But this city beach -- a 25-minute drive west of Kingston -- isn't quite brochure-ready. In lieu of cushy cabanas and dainty umbrellas are rickety wooden tables and slabs of wood serving as ersatz beach chairs. But therein lies its allure. Hellshire is that rare Jamaican beach scene made by and for locals. Once known as Healthshire on account of its reputation as a health retreat, the beach still offers Kingstonians rejuvenation: the chance to escape the city for a few hours, sip a cool Red Stripe and listen to the reggae music emerging from shacks lining the sand. For about 600 Jamaican dollars, about $7, those shacks, with names like Prendy's and Screechy's, dole out just-caught fish and lobster served steamed or fried, with a vinegary relish of scotch bonnet pepper and onion or slathered in brown stew and topped with okra, carrots and potatoes. On the side: bammy (cassava cakes, fried or steamed) or festival (fried, doughnut-like bread). It's ubiquitous local cuisine, but rare is the Jamaican who wouldn't agree that Hellshire has perfected the art of it."

2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"It's a Caribbean clothing brand with a radical notion: There's more to the Cayman Islands than banks and beaches. One Tree Four Five, playfully named after the islands' area code (Caribbean accents drop the ''h'' in ''three''), is the brainchild of the Caymanian designer Luigi Moxam, who is determined to confer the sort of cultural recognition and coolness factor on his homeland that, say, Puma's Jamaica line bestows on that well-branded island. The result? Locally designed T-shirts, tanks, jewelry, resort and swim wear, most featuring island slang: ''Love Ya Like Cook Food,'' ''Doin Big Tings From a Small Island,'' ''Wha Ya Sayin'' and the ever-handy ''Who You Tink You Is?'' On every item is the One Tree Four Five logo: the endangered Grand Caymanian blue iguana. A portion of profits on some lines is donated to local charities, and last month, the company's first flagship store opened on Grand Cayman. It's actually more than a clothing store: Shop, then enjoy a meal of fresh fish and locally distilled rum at the restaurant on site. George Town, Grand Cayman; onetreefourfive.com."

2011-11-13T00:00:00Z,"Curaçao is the ultimate cultural mashup: a Dutch island just off Venezuela, once an African slave port and now a dynamic country populated by some 50 nationalities. If Curaçao had a soundtrack it would be Papiamentu, the island's Creole language, said to be a hybrid of Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, English and West African dialects. And if it had a taste, it would be one of a kind. Proof is in the Old Market (Marsche Bieuw), in the heart of Curaçao's picture-perfect capital, Willemstad. There, behind the Queen Wilhelmina Foot Bridge, vendors dole out food from colossal pots. You'll find Dutch favorites like fried bitterballen (fried beef balls) and Spanish-style mondongo (tripe and vegetable soup). Indonesian food comes via Suriname, also a former Dutch colony, and includes bami, long noodles cooked with veggies and meat, and sate, grilled meats doused in peanut sauce. But the kuminda krioyo -- local Creole cuisine -- is the real draw here. Try the iguana, served in a soup or stewed, with a side of rice and peas. The fried fish and funchi (cornmeal paste akin to polenta) is best when doused in pika, a tangy onion-and-pepper relish. Guiambo is a viscous okra and seafood soup, and the slimy yet tasty kadushi soup is made from local cactus. Carry a brimming, ultra-affordable plate to one of the communal picnic tables and dive in."

After all, low interest rates make it cheaper to buy a medallion with borrowed money, and prices have doubled in the past five years. At the going rate, the total value of all medallions is more than $10 billion -- more than the market capitalization of several large U.S. airlines. But not everyone sees them as overvalued assets. ''These are mini cash cows running around the city,'' says Andrew Murstein, president of Medallion Financial, a publicly traded company that finances medallion investors.

But with more development encroaching on the downtown area of Cruz Bay, you'd be smart to venture, even for just an afternoon, to Coral Bay. Located at the opposite end of the island from Cruz Bay, about 20 minutes away by car, Coral Bay is about as remote as it gets in the United States Virgin Islands. A road sign on the drive out that reads ''Not Cruz Bay'' says it all. The bay's deep and well-sheltered natural harbor, appropriately named Hurricane Hole, doesn't offer much in the way of a beach. But its mangroves are overlooked for exploring, whether in a kayak, by paddle board or with a snorkel and mask.

Thanks to clever new digital devices, a dry philodendron, undernourished hibiscus, or sadly neglected wandering Jew can send its owner a text or Twitter message. Humans like to feel appreciated, so a begonia may also send a simple ''Thank-you'' text -- when it's happy, as gardeners like to say, meaning healthy and well-tended. Picture your Boston fern home alone placing Botanicalls. But why should potted plants be the only ones to reassure their humans? Another company has found a way for crops to send text messages in unison, letting their farmer know if she's doing a good enough job to deserve a robust harvest. What is the sound of one hand of bananas clapping? Probes monitoring the soil can send a range of prerecorded messages specific to each plant's needs. Plants texting humans may be new, but malcontent plants have always been chatting among themselves. When an elm tree is being attacked by insects, it does the chemical equivalent of broadcasting ''I'm hurt! You could be next!'' alerting others in its grove to whip up some dandy poisons."

2011-11-14T00:00:00Z,"Evelyn H. Lauder, a refugee of Nazi-occupied Europe who married into an illustrious family in the beauty business and became an ardent advocate for breast cancer awareness, raising millions for research, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 75. The cause was nongenetic ovarian cancer, said Alexandra Trower, a spokeswoman for the Estée Lauder Companies. As the wife of Leonard A. Lauder, the chairman emeritus of the Estée Lauder Companies, and as the daughter-in-law of the company's formidable matriarch, Estée Lauder, Evelyn Lauder had to establish her own place in a family as complex as it was competitive. Mrs. Lauder frequently told the story of how, early in her marriage, she returned to the couple's apartment to find that Estée had rearranged the furniture more to her liking. When Evelyn and Leonard were dating -- it was only their second date -- Estée implored her to stay and be the hostess for a birthday party she was giving her son. ''So I stayed,'' Mrs. Lauder said in an interview in 2008. ''What could I do? She was like a steamroller.'' Yet it was clear that Estée was crazy about the young woman, and soon after Evelyn's marriage, in 1959, she joined the family cosmetics company, then a small enterprise, pitching in wherever she was needed. ''I was very strong,'' she said. ''Having had a childhood like the one I had, I was much more tough than a lot of people. I was one of the few people who spoke my mind to Estée.'' Mrs. Lauder learned she had breast cancer in 1989 and soon became a strong voice on behalf of women's health, though she was always reluctant to discuss her own condition. ''My situation doesn't really matter,'' she told a reporter in 1995. She was a creator of the Pink Ribbon campaign, a worldwide symbol of breast health, and in 1993 she founded the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, which has raised more than $350 million. In 2007 she received a diagnosis of ovarian cancer, which developed independently of her breast cancer, Ms. Trower said. Evelyn Hausner was born on Aug. 12, 1936, in Vienna, the only child of Ernest and Mimi Hausner. Her father, a dapper man who lived in Poland and Berlin before marrying the daughter of a Viennese lumber supplier, owned a lingerie shop. In 1938, with Hitler's annexation of Austria, the family left Vienna, taking a few belongings, including household silver, which Ernest Hausner used to obtain visas to Belgium. The family eventually reached England, where Evelyn's mother was immediately sent to an internment camp on the Isle of Man. ''The separation was very traumatic for me,'' Mrs. Lauder said. Her father placed her in a nursery until her mother could be released and he could raise money. In 1940, the family set sail for New York, where her father worked as a diamond cutter during the war. In 1947, he and his wife bought a dress shop in Manhattan called Lamay. Over time they expanded it to a chain of five shops. Mrs. Lauder grew up on West 86th Street and attended Public School 9. During her freshman year at Hunter College, she met Leonard Lauder on a blind date. Already graduated from college and training to be a naval officer, Mr. Lauder had grown up on West 76th Street, though in a sense it was a world apart. ''He was the first person who took me out to dinner in a restaurant,'' she recalled. They married four years later at the Plaza Hotel. Though always at home by 4 p.m. when her two children were little, Mrs. Lauder said she never considered being a stay-at-home mom, in spite of the family's growing wealth. ''I couldn't bear it,'' she said. ''I grew up with a working mother.'' Mrs. Lauder was also a public school teacher for several years. She held many roles at Estée Lauder, including creator of training programs and director of new products and marketing. In 1989, the year of her breast cancer diagnosis, she became the senior corporate vice president and head of fragrance development worldwide. Mrs. Lauder is survived by her husband; her sons, William and Gary; and five grandchildren. Though Mrs. Lauder, an avid photographer, had a home in Colorado and a penthouse on Fifth Avenue lined with modern art, she and her husband liked to retreat to a plain cabin in Putnam County, N.Y., where Mrs. Lauder might serve guests German food she had prepared. Asked once how she felt about working with her husband in the early days, she replied, ''Working with Leonard was a riot.'' Indeed, she joked that he had such a sense of business, without family favoritism, that getting an appointment with him was sometimes tough. ''It would take me much longer to get a date with him,'' she said, ''than someone who didn't have his name.''

2011-11-14T00:00:00Z,"LAUDER--Evelyn H. The employees of the Estee Lauder Companies deeply mourn the passing of Evelyn H. Lauder, Senior Corporate Vice President and Head of Fragrance Development Worldwide. She died peacefully of complications from non-genetic ovarian cancer on November 12th at the age of 75 at her home in New York City, surrounded by her family. Mrs. Lauder was a beloved friend and colleague to the entire employee family. She was a risk-taker and trailblazer and always led with style. One of her greatest joys in life and business was applying the many aspects of her creativity and invaluable insights to new products and brands. A schoolteacher by training, Mrs. Lauder joined the Estee Lauder Companies in its infancy in 1959. Ever the teacher, Mrs. Lauder created ground-breaking education training programs--practices the Estee Lauder Companies uses to this day to maintain its place as a leader in global prestige beauty. She helped her much-loved mother-in-law, Mrs. Estee Lauder, develop and launch the Company's first men's fragrance, Aramis. And she was the driving force behind the idea for the brand Clinique, coming up with the brand's name and becoming its first Training Director. Her passion for beauty and nature, as well as her work on Aramis, helped frame what would become one of her most important imprints on the Company. In 1989, Mrs. Lauder began a successful 22-year career in fragrances after discovering her innate talent for recognizing distinct fragrance notes. It was an interest she shared with Mrs. Estee Lauder and one that stemmed from Mrs. Lauder's lifelong passion for flowers and gardening. Her rare ability to visualize unique fragrance combinations led to some of the Company's most successful global fragrances, including the best-selling Beautiful and Pleasures. In 1989, she assumed the role of Senior Corporate Vice President and Head of Fragrance Development Worldwide, a position she held and cherished until her death. In 1992, Mrs. Lauder began her mission to bring global awareness to breast cancer when she launched the Company's Breast Cancer Awareness (BCA) Campaign and co-created the Pink Ribbon, now known as the worldwide symbol of breast health. Through its brands, employees and fundraising initiatives with its retail partners, the BCA Campaign has raised more than $50 million for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded by Mrs. Lauder in 1993 to provide crucial funds to the world's top medical and scientific researchers. Mrs. Lauder loved the Estee Lauder Companies and she loved its people, whom she considered part of her extended family. Those who had the opportunity to meet and work with her were touched by her kindness, warmth and deep, personal interest in them, whether they were behind the department store counter or a senior executive. She made a point to visit our counters in every country she visited and was sincerely interested in people's lives. She was known for her quick humor and was valued for her advice on almost any subject: love, marriage, finding the perfect lipstickeven on how to make her famous brisket. Mrs. Lauder's caring and pioneering spirit, business talent, fiery charm, extraordinary philanthropic drive, and enthusiastic love of life will be sorely missed by us all. She had an enormous impact on each one of us. She was a treasured role model to every employee of the Estee Lauder Companies, and our thoughts are with the Lauder family during this difficult time. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Evelyn Lauder Founder's Fund: www.bcrfcure.org or 60 East 56th Street, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10022."

2011-11-15T13:30:37Z,"There was much controversy leading up to the Museum of Contemporary Art's annual fund-raising gala, which was held over the weekend in a tent in front of the museum in downtown Los Angeles. Despite all efforts to maintain secrecy, word had leaked that Marina Abramovic, who art-directed the event, was going to submit a cast of young men and women to acts reminiscent of some of the often excruciating performances that have made her one of the world's most well-known performance artists. Some would be required to lay dead still in the nude on a lazy susan or buried under a skeleton for hours on end; others would stick their heads out from underneath a table, maintaining a straight face throughout the course of the evening, while surrounding guests feasted on a three-course meal. The news prompted another veteran performance artist, Yvonne Rainer, to send an open letter to the museum director, Jeffrey Deitch, protesting abuse and exploitation in the name of museum fund-raising. While Rainer's letter may have spoiled some of the night's surprises (and reportedly added to Abramovic's pre-event jitters), for the gala's organizers it proved to be an unexpected public relations blessing, keeping much of the art world abuzz long before the first guests even hit the red carpet."

Lauder Breast Center, which opened in 1992 at 205 East 64th Street. This outpatient facility, which served as a model for breast cancer centers around the world, offered multidisciplinary care for breast cancer patients, who were able to see experts from surgeons to medical oncologists to psychiatrists and social workers all under one roof. In 2009, MSKCC opened the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center in a new home at 300 East 66th Street. This state-of-the-art center offers comprehensive breast cancer services in a patient-centered setting designed to accommodate evolving modalities in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. The serenity and beauty of the treatment areas reflect Mrs. Lauder's commitment to building a home for patients and for their physicians and nurses, and her belief in the healing power of nature, natural light, and art. But its deeper beauty derives from what it enables and facilitates-the rapid translation of laboratory and clinical discoveries into meaningful advances for patients with cancer. Women with breast cancer and their families, as well as the members of our treatment and research communities, will be forever grateful for Mrs. Lauder's philanthropic support, wisdom, enthusiasm, and guidance.

2011-11-15T00:00:00Z,"LAUDER--Evelyn H. The employees of the Estee Lauder Companies deeply mourn the passing of Evelyn H. Lauder, Senior Corporate Vice President and Head of Fragrance Development Worldwide. She died peacefully of complications from non-genetic ovarian cancer on November 12th at the age of 75 at her home in New York City, surrounded by her family. Mrs. Lauder was a beloved friend and colleague to the entire employee family. She was a risk-taker and trailblazer and always led with style. One of her greatest joys in life and business was applying the many aspects of her creativity and invaluable insights to new products and brands. A schoolteacher by training, Mrs. Lauder joined the Estee Lauder Companies in its infancy in 1959. Ever the teacher, Mrs. Lauder created ground-breaking education training programs--practices the Estee Lauder Companies uses to this day to maintain its place as a leader in global prestige beauty. She helped her much-loved mother-in-law, Mrs. Estee Lauder, develop and launch the Company's first men's fragrance, Aramis. And she was the driving force behind the idea for the brand Clinique, coming up with the brand's name and becoming its first Training Director. Her passion for beauty and nature, as well as her work on Aramis, helped frame what would become one of her most important imprints on the Company. In 1989, Mrs. Lauder began a successful 22-year career in fragrances after discovering her innate talent for recognizing distinct fragrance notes. It was an interest she shared with Mrs. Estee Lauder and one that stemmed from Mrs. Lauder's lifelong passion for flowers and gardening. Her rare ability to visualize unique fragrance combinations led to some of the Company's most successful global fragrances, including the best-selling Beautiful and Pleasures. In 1989, she assumed the role of Senior Corporate Vice President and Head of Fragrance Development Worldwide, a position she held and cherished until her death. In 1992, Mrs. Lauder began her mission to bring global awareness to breast cancer when she launched the Company's Breast Cancer Awareness (BCA) Campaign and co-created the Pink Ribbon, now known as the worldwide symbol of breast health. Through its brands, employees and fundraising initiatives with its retail partners, the BCA Campaign has raised more than $50 million for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded by Mrs. Lauder in 1993 to provide crucial funds to the world's top medical and scientific researchers. Mrs. Lauder loved the Estee Lauder Companies and she loved its people, whom she considered part of her extended family. Those who had the opportunity to meet and work with her were touched by her kindness, warmth and deep, personal interest in them, whether they were behind the department store counter or a senior executive. She made a point to visit our counters in every country she visited and was sincerely interested in people's lives. She was known for her quick humor and was valued for her advice on almost any subject: love, marriage, finding the perfect lipstickeven on how to make her famous brisket. Mrs. Lauder's caring and pioneering spirit, business talent, fiery charm, extraordinary philanthropic drive, and enthusiastic love of life will be sorely missed by us all. She had an enormous impact on each one of us. She was a treasured role model to every employee of the Estee Lauder Companies, and our thoughts are with the Lauder family during this difficult time. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Evelyn Lauder Founder's Fund: www.bcrfcure.org or 60 East 56th Street, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10022."

Born April 25, 1917, in Spokane, Washington, Bob was the younger of two sons of Mathilde B. and Sigurd H. Lee. The family moved to Portland, Oregon when Bob was two. There he attended Benson Polytechnic High School, where he began a lifelong career in journalism, serving as editor of the school paper and as a stringer for the Portland Oregonian. He enrolled in Reed College in 1934, but on the advice of his editor at the Oregonian transferred to the University of Oregon, from which he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1938, majoring in English. In 1936, he met his future wife, Catherine Taylor, then a journalism student at University of Oregon. They married in 1941 and had three children. After graduation, Bob joined the Oregonian where he worked until 1960, first as a reporter and later as an editor. His stint at the Oregonian was interrupted by two years' service as a radio technician in the Navy during WWII. He was instrumental in founding the Portland Reporter, an independent daily paper, which was published from 1960 to 1964. In 1960 he joined the New York Times, and the family moved to Montclair, NJ. In 1962, the Times sent him to Los Angeles for the start-up of Western Edition, of which he became managing editor. The family returned east in 1964, where he worked for the Times until retiring in 1980, finishing his career as head of the make-up desk and associate news editor. Following retirement, Bob and Katy returned to Portland, where they enjoyed their life together until Katy's death in 2005 at the age of 85. During this period, the couple traveled extensively, to Europe, South America, Africa and Asia, as well making numerous trips to visit their children and grandchildren. Throughout his life, Bob was known for his kindness and compassion, his liberal politics, keen intelligence and wit. He was an avid golfer, an insightful student of history and politics, and lover of literature and the arts, regularly attending the theater, opera, and symphony both in New York and later in Portland. But most of all, he was devoted to his family and friends, and will be deeply missed by those whose lives he touched. He is survived by a daughter and son-in-law, Stephanie and Fred Ostmann of Tacoma, WA; two sons and daughters-in-law, Daniel T. and Nelma Lee, of Portland, OR, and Robert S. and Laura Lee, of Houston, TX; three grandchildren, Dr. Heather Ostmann currently of Jacksonville, FL, Lilah Helton, of Seattle, WA, and Natalie Lee of Houston, TX; and great-granddaughter Stephanie Ann Despain, of Jacksonville, FL. He was predeceased by his wife Katy and brother Norman K. Lee of Boise, Idaho. A memorial service will be held in Portland, OR, on December 3. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Oregon Food Bank P.O.Box 55370, Portland, OR 97238. ww.oregonfoodbank.org."

Edge, who wrote the music and lyrics for ''Spider-Man'' with Bono, had previously used those two adjectives to describe Ms. Taymor's state of mind last winter. Of those adjectives, Ms. Taymor told Esquire, ''I think that those were important to paint a picture of a director who you needed to release in order to make this big change. I had to be characterized that way in order for something to happen.'' After her firing, ''Spider-Man'' shut down for three weeks to insert new dialogue and scenes that Ms. Taymor's former colleagues had been secretly preparing and sharing with the producers during the winter."

He has devoted years of inquiry into political movements and the curious nature of artistic expression, most famously in his 1982 biography of the artist Robert Irwin, ""Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees."" His newest book, ""Uncanny Valley: Adventures in the Narrative"" (Counterpoint Press), collects pieces, previously published in Artforum, The New Yorker, Wired and elsewhere, about such disparate subjects as digital animators and human-rights monitors, but which are connected by the kind of distinct, inimitable narrative thread only Weschler can weave.

2011-11-16T00:00:00Z,"1:30 P.M. (HBO Signature) BOBBY FISCHER AGAINST THE WORLD (2011) Liz Garbus (''The Farm: Angola, USA'') profiles Fischer (1943-2008), the prickly individualist from Brooklyn who became a chess grandmaster and in 1972 turned his match with Boris Spassky (left above, with Fischer), his Soviet counterpart, into a global media event. She also documents Fischer's inner turmoil, which in later years prompted him to live in exile in Japan and Iceland and to give voice to a worldview rife with conspiracy theories and anti-Semitism, despite his Jewish background. ''What happened?,'' A. O. Scott asked in The New York Times. The film, he wrote, ''does not traffic in easy explanations or medical diagnoses, but it leaves the strong impression of a continuity between the oddness Fischer displayed in early interviews and the mania so jarringly evident toward the end. And it also tactfully but strongly posits a connection between the genius he brought to an infinitely complex game and the madness that defined his relationship to just about everything else.'' And yet, Mr. Scott added, ''if he had been spared fame, the world would have been denied a share of sublimity, and the kingdom of chess would never have found its wayward, dazzling, tragic prince.'' 11:45 A.M. (Comedy Central) RUN FATBOY RUN (2008) A huffing and puffing security guard (Simon Pegg, above) enters the same marathon as the rich American boyfriend (Hank Azaria) of his former fiancée (Thandie Newton), whom he left on their wedding day. He wants to prove to her and to their son that he can see a plan through. This kind of movie could be dismissed as ''a goofy lark,'' Matt Zoller Seitz said in The Times. ''But it's also a rare comedy that believes in its own message, and that could inspire the depressed and the demoralized to grit their teeth and keep running.''"

Her daughter Dyllan and dear friend Blair were at her side. Peggy instilled in each of us the importance of being real. She cared deeply about the people in her life and let them know it through quiet and generous deeds. Leaving her apartment each day wearing a baseball cap and pants (never dresses) she touched the lives of many, including her doormen and shopkeepers in the neighborhood who were among her close friends. Despite her love of fancy sheets and linens, Peggy found joy in simple things. Coca-Cola, M&M's, Cheetos, a crossword puzzle and a good movie made her happy. A proud mother and grandmother, she was a stickler for proper grammar and manners. Young people were drawn to her because she was truly interested in them and never judgmental. She was an excellent listener and her wry sense of humor made every family gathering more fun. Peggy was as real and genuine as any person can be. She is survived by her daughter Dyllan, her son-in-law Mark Weigel, and her grandsons Max and Henry who are infused with her love. She is also survived by her brother and sister Harry and Sally Sweatt, her nieces and nephews, her beloved Alma, and all of her surrogate children she cared for so deeply. Funeral services will be held at 2pm on Monday, November 21st at Unitarian Church of All Souls in New York City.

The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon available to the union, District Council 37, in its effort to reverse the layoffs. Some 672 school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city's lowest paid lost their jobs on Oct. 7 in a move that union leaders have described as political payback for their refusal to let the city tap a health care fund run by labor groups to close its budget gap last spring."

2011-11-16T00:00:00Z,"Before the final week of the 2010 regular season, I noted that Drew Brees and Tom Brady had thrown at least one touchdown pass in each of their team's first 15 games. Brady threw a pair of touchdown passes against Miami in the season finale last season, and has thrown at least one touchdown pass in every game this year, giving him 25 consecutive games with a touchdown pass. But Brees also kept his streak alive in Week 17 last season. In fact, after throwing for two touchdowns against the Falcons on Sunday, Brees has now thrown a touchdown pass in 37 consecutive regular-season games. Over a five-year period from 1956 to 1960, Johnny Unitas threw a touchdown pass in 47 consecutive games in which he played, a record that has yet to be broken. Unitas missed two games with injury during the streak -- and Brees missed one game during his streak when the Saints had already clinched the N.F.C's top seed and he had set a league record -- but missed games are not counted by the N.F.L. for purposes of such touchdown streaks."

2011-11-16T00:00:00Z,"Broadway producers are planning a fall 2012 opening for ''Leap of Faith,'' a musical starring four-time Tony Award nominee Raul Esparza (''Company'') that was adapted from the 1992 Steve Martin film about an evangelical con man who is offered a chance at redemption. Thomas Viertel, one of the lead producers, said on Tuesday that closed-door developmental readings of the musical last week drew strong feedback from an invited audience, including potential investors, leading the producers to deem the show ready for Broadway. A 2010 production of ''Leap of Faith'' in Los Angeles drew mixed reviews from critics. Since then, Alan Menken and Glenn Slater, the show's composer and lyricist, wrote five new songs and the book underwent a ''substantial rewrite,'' including the loss of one character and the combination of some others, Mr. Viertel said. ''Our creative team has done great work in clarifying the story, making it more fun, and creating surprises in how the story is told,'' Mr. Viertel said, adding that the show is also 25 minutes shorter than it was in Los Angeles. He said the Broadway capitalization would be between $10 million and $15 million. No theater or casting was ready to be announced on Tuesday, though Mr. Esparza would be certain to star. The female lead, a single mother who becomes involved with the preacher, was played in Los Angeles by Brooke Shields, who is no longer involved; the role was played in the readings last week by Jessica Phillips, who is now featured as Marion in the Broadway musical ''Priscilla Queen of the Desert.''"

The Americans, who had scored only two goals in a 1-4-1 start under their new coach Jurgen Klinsmann, came out in a more attacking, 4-4-2 formation against Slovenia. Buddle and Altidore started up front, with Dempsey tucked behind, and they took the game to Slovenia from the opening minute, when Fabian Johnson nearly scored on a rocketed shot from the top of the penalty area. Buddle opened the scoring in the ninth minute, pinging a 25-yard shot in off the left post after Altidore and Dempsey forced a turnover."

2011-11-16T00:00:00Z,"LAUDER--Evelyn H. The employees of the Estee Lauder Companies deeply mourn the passing of Evelyn H. Lauder, Senior Corporate Vice President and Head of Fragrance Development Worldwide. She died peacefully of complications from non-genetic ovarian cancer on November 12th at the age of 75 at her home in New York City, surrounded by her family. Mrs. Lauder was a beloved friend and colleague to the entire employee family. She was a risk-taker and trailblazer and always led with style. One of her greatest joys in life and business was applying the many aspects of her creativity and invaluable insights to new products and brands. A schoolteacher by training, Mrs. Lauder joined the Estee Lauder Companies in its infancy in 1959. Ever the teacher, Mrs. Lauder created ground-breaking education training programs--practices the Estee Lauder Companies uses to this day to maintain its place as a leader in global prestige beauty. She helped her much-loved mother-in-law, Mrs. Estee Lauder, develop and launch the Company's first men's fragrance, Aramis. And she was the driving force behind the idea for the brand Clinique, coming up with the brand's name and becoming its first Training Director. Her passion for beauty and nature, as well as her work on Aramis, helped frame what would become one of her most important imprints on the Company. In 1989, Mrs. Lauder began a successful 22-year career in fragrances after discovering her innate talent for recognizing distinct fragrance notes. It was an interest she shared with Mrs. Estee Lauder and one that stemmed from Mrs. Lauder's lifelong passion for flowers and gardening. Her rare ability to visualize unique fragrance combinations led to some of the Company's most successful global fragrances, including the best-selling Beautiful and Pleasures. In 1989, she assumed the role of Senior Corporate Vice President and Head of Fragrance Development Worldwide, a position she held and cherished until her death. In 1992, Mrs. Lauder began her mission to bring global awareness to breast cancer when she launched the Company's Breast Cancer Awareness (BCA) Campaign and co-created the Pink Ribbon, now known as the worldwide symbol of breast health. Through its brands, employees and fundraising initiatives with its retail partners, the BCA Campaign has raised more than $50 million for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded by Mrs. Lauder in 1993 to provide crucial funds to the world's top medical and scientific researchers. Mrs. Lauder loved the Estee Lauder Companies and she loved its people, whom she considered part of her extended family. Those who had the opportunity to meet and work with her were touched by her kindness, warmth and deep, personal interest in them, whether they were behind the department store counter or a senior executive. She made a point to visit our counters in every country she visited and was sincerely interested in people's lives. She was known for her quick humor and was valued for her advice on almost any subject: love, marriage, finding the perfect lipstickeven on how to make her famous brisket. Mrs. Lauder's caring and pioneering spirit, business talent, fiery charm, extraordinary philanthropic drive, and enthusiastic love of life will be sorely missed by us all. She had an enormous impact on each one of us. She was a treasured role model to every employee of the Estee Lauder Companies, and our thoughts are with the Lauder family during this difficult time. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Evelyn Lauder Founder's Fund: www.bcrfcure.org or 60 East 56th Street, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10022."

Since its establishment in 1993, BCRF has provided breast cancer researchers around the world with crucial funds for their studies. Here at Rockefeller, BCRF has long supported breast cancer research in the laboratories of Paul Nurse and Titia de Lange.

Brian Burke of Advanced NFL Stats said Smith had played the percentages correctly based on Win Probability: ''The go-for-it option is worth, on net, a 0.47 W.P. That's better than the 0.42 W.P. of the punt option, at least according to league-average percentages.

The group drew on information about 127 nonprofit dance makers and organizations, culled from the statewide Cultural Data Project, which offers detailed data on finances, programs and employment in arts and culture. The report highlighted a strong start-up culture of dance. The smallest groups, with budgets of $25,000 to $99,000, had low numbers of full-time and part-time staff and relied on significant in-kind resources but still managed a high level of new creations. Nineteen percent of all premieres and 22 percent of all commissions came from companies with budgets in that range. Companies with budgets of more than $5 million were responsible for 15 percent of all premieres and 31.3 percent of all commissions."

But as authorities comb through some 38,000 customer accounts, they are growing more suspicious about what went wrong at MF Global, the commodities powerhouse once run by Jon S. Corzine, the former Democratic governor of New Jersey."
2011-11-17T00:00:00Z,"McGEE--Margaret. Family and friends mourn the loss of our dear Peggy. She died peacefully at home on November 14th after a short battle with pancreatic cancer. Her daughter Dyllan and dear friend Blair were at her side. Peggy instilled in each of us the importance of being real. She cared deeply about the people in her life and let them know it through quiet and generous deeds. Leaving her apartment each day wearing a baseball cap and pants (never dresses) she touched the lives of many, including her doormen and shopkeepers in the neighborhood who were among her close friends. Despite her love of fancy sheets and linens, Peggy found joy in simple things. Coca-Cola, M&M's, Cheetos, a crossword puzzle and a good movie made her happy. A proud mother and grandmother, she was a stickler for proper grammar and manners. Young people were drawn to her because she was truly interested in them and never judgmental. She was an excellent listener and her wry sense of humor made every family gathering more fun. Peggy was as real and genuine as any person can be. She is survived by her daughter Dyllan, her son-in-law Mark Weigel, and her grandsons Max and Henry who are infused with her love. She is also survived by her brother and sister Harry and Sally Sweatt, her nieces and nephews, her beloved Alma, and all of her surrogate children she cared for so deeply. Funeral services will be held at 2pm on Monday, November 21st at Unitarian Church of All Souls in New York City. In lieu of flowers, Peggy has asked that donations in her memory be made to the Meserve Kunhardt Foundation and the Mt. Kisco Child Care Center."
2011-11-17T00:00:00Z,"Some ''South Park'' fans wondered if the end was near for the animated series earlier this year when Trey Parker and Matt Stone turned in an episode that centered on the cynicism and unhappiness of the main characters, complete with the playing of the Fleetwood Mac song ''Landslide.'' A metaphor, maybe? Maybe not. On Wednesday Comedy Central, the channel that has shown 15 seasons of ''South Park,'' said it had signed up Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone to write, direct and edit the series through 2016, thus reaching a 20th season. Their prior contract ran only through 2013. There had been at least a bit of anxiety at Comedy Central about whether the pair would extend it further, given their success this year with the Broadway musical ''The Book of Mormon.''"

Chief among them is sleeping - as opposed to lying down.

The urgency that brought those owners and the now-defunct National Basketball Players Association within a few minor system considerations of a deal is now gone, and in its place is a vague time line formed by a drop-dead date for cancellation of the entire season (likely in early January), a relatively slow-moving legal process, and the owners' whims."

An exhibition that opened in Vienna yesterday, and that will later travel to Hong Kong, Tokyo and Paris, features a selection from Van Noten's spring 2012 collection alongside photographs by the London-born artist James Reeve that inspired them. Among the pieces are Reeve's photo of buildings in La Rouviere, a housing complex in Marseille, and the shirt that Van Noten applied it to. ""I liked the mystery, the lights at night, the moment of wonder, where you're questioning what's happening on the other side of the windows,"" says Van Noten of the image. Reeve, too, considers the picture quite voyeuristic. ""It's like 1,000 small colorful television screens all lined up in rows on the hillside,"" he says. ""I have often seen people peering into the windows, trying to discover what kind of activity is going on inside."" Other pieces on view with their corresponding photographs include Van Noten's bridge shift and ""Circus, Circus"" top. ""I'm used to seeing my work as two-dimensional,"" Reeve says. ""It was inspiring to see Dries translate it into dynamic forms -- the way the ruffle skirts seem to almost play with the lights as they move, the colored crystals that he sewed into the windows of La Rouviere.

The ducks had become coated with residual petroleum floating on the pond, which was filled with wastewater from the process used to extract oil from the strip-mined sands. ''It wasn't that I'm a rabid environmentalist,'' Dr. Painter said recently. ''It just occurred to me that we were working with something that might prove useful.''"
2011-11-18T00:00:00Z,"The Tony Award-winning actors Bernadette Peters and Martin Short will meet with a team of theater producers this month to discuss a possible Broadway revival of ''I Do! I Do!,'' the 1966 Tom Jones-Harvey Schmidt musical about the trials and tribulations of a married couple over a 50-year period, according to theater executives familiar with the discussions. The meeting is not a developmental reading or industry workshop for potential investors - steps that would indicate a revival is likely - but rather a preliminary meeting to talk about the script and bat around ideas for the characters, Agnes and Michael Snow. The executives spoke on condition of anonymity because the producers considering the project had not authorized its disclosure."
2011-11-18T00:00:00Z,"Mississippi voters just approved a new law requiring voters to show photo identification at the polls. But that law will not go into effect immediately, thanks to the Voting Rights Act. Instead Mississippi will get in line behind Texas and South Carolina as the Department of Justice examines each state's voter ID laws, in a process known as ''preclearance.'' The Justice Department will allow each law to go into effect only if the state can show its law will not have a racially discriminatory purpose or effect. Such proof may be hard to come by: a recent study by The Associated Press found that African-American voters in South Carolina would be much harder hit by that state's ID law than white voters because they often don't have the right kind of identification. But this important preclearance procedure may not be around much longer. Before the next election season rolls around, the Supreme Court could well strike down this provision of the law as an unconstitutional infringement on states' rights, leaving minority voters essentially unprotected from efforts to diminish their voting power. Congress needs to act before then to protect voting rights everywhere."

The younger Mr. Geller entered his father's business in 1936 and helped shape it in to one of the leading manufacturers of the classic high-heel ""pump"" after WW II. The company also manufactured women's handbags and had a flagship retail store in NYC on West 57th street which attracted multitudes of passers-by with it's innovative window displays.

Every major fashion department and specialty store carried the brand.

2011-11-19T00:00:00Z,"The long bloody reign of ''Dexter'' on Showtime will continue for at least two more seasons. Showtime announced on Friday that it had ordered a seventh and eighth season of the dark comic drama about a serial killer, largely because the show continues to be among the most popular that the pay cable channel has ever produced. Ratings for the current sixth season have been up for five weeks in a row, Showtime reported, and with all the possible ways to see the show factored in -- premiere telecast, DVR playback, repeat plays on the channel and on-demand plays -- it is averaging more than five million viewers per episode, the best for any season of ''Dexter.'' Showtime previously announced that it had signed up the series's star, Michael C. Hall, above, for two more seasons. Each additional season will produce 12 episodes, the channel said. The eight-season run is unusual for cable shows. ''The Sopranos'' ran for six seasons (over eight years) as did ''Sex and the City''; both are widely considered to be among cable's most successful series. Unless, of course, you count ''South Park'' on Comedy Central. That series just concluded a deal that will keep it on the air for 20 seasons."

''The Veri**on Play,'' by Ms. Kron and directed by Nicholas Martin, is a mix of screwball comedy and horror that begins with a call to customer service about a cellphone bill. Ms. Mansour's play ''The Hour of Feeling,'' directed by Mark Wing-Davey, takes place in 1967 as borders in the Middle East are about to change.

''But 'The Dilemma,' written by Allan Loeb and directed by Ron Howard -- hardly a name associated with frat-boy yukfests -- is not entirely what it appears to be.

Producers have predicted that the new film, ''The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,'' which opened on Friday, will bring in more than $140 million at United States and Canadian box offices before the weekend is finished. Based on Stephenie Meyer's ''Twilight'' novels, the films tell the story of a romance between Bella Swan, a teenage girl played by Kristen Stewart, above with Robert Pattinson, and her vampire lover, Edward Cullen, played by Mr. Pattinson. (A werewolf named Jacob Black, played by Taylor Lautner, also vies for Bella's affection.) The film tells how Edward carries the day and marries Bella. ''The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 1'' did slightly better during its midnight opening than the previous movie in the series, ''The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,'' which grossed $30.1 million when it came out in June 2010. Still, the latest Twilight movie came nowhere near touching the final installment of the Harry Potter saga -- ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2'' -- which set a record for a midnight opening in July, earning $43.5 million. That movie went on to set a three-day weekend record with $169.2 million in the United States and Canada."

Dowd in the Pulitzer Prize-winning comedy ''Harvey,'' about a man who claims to be friends with a 6-foot-tall rabbit no one else can see. Two theater executives close to the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the possible deal, said Mr. Parsons, above, was in negotiations with Roundabout Theater Company. Representatives for Mr. Parsons and for Roundabout declined to comment. The two executives said the production hinged on the schedule of Mr. Parsons, who stars as the socially awkward theoretical physicist Sheldon Cooper in ''The Big Bang Theory'' on CBS, for which he won the Emmy for best actor in a comedy in 2010 and again in September. Mr. Parsons made his Broadway debut last spring, to critical accolades, in the Tony Award-winning revival of ''The Normal Heart,'' playing the young gay activist Tommy Boatwright. ''Harvey,'' by Mary Chase, opened on Broadway in 1944 and ran for more than four years; the play was made into a movie in 1950 starring Jimmy Stewart as Elwood and Josephine Hull as his exasperated sister Veta, a performance that earned her an Academy Award for best supporting actress. The play has been revived once on Broadway, in 1970, starring Stewart and Helen Hayes (in her final Broadway production) as Veta."

I'd had just about all the juice cleanses, freaky fasts and detox diets I could stomach, and was ready to bite off something I could actually chew.

I hurtle with him from the capital of Quito down two and a half hours of gut-stirring switchbacks, losing elevation with every turn. The sugar-cane and cattle farmsteads tumbling past on either side dwindle steadily, while the surrounding forests gain in age and power. Sevilla talks the whole way. Slender, mustached and hugely energetic, he recites the names of tree species, describes different hummingbirds and tells stories about the foundations of Ecuador's conservation movement. ''I have been in Europe, Africa, Asia and North America,'' he says, ''but Ecuador - and I don't say this only because it is my home - is truly special.''"

But many independent and chain hotels have been rethinking room service, making it more desirable. For starters, guests can increasingly find healthy choices for in-room dining. Kimpton hotels recently rolled out a Travel Healthy menu, on which all choices are under 500 calories. The Pierre in New York City is set to unveil a menu featuring lower-calorie dishes (above), and the Waldorf-Astoria has selections catering to diets like gluten-free and low sodium. Room service is also becoming more like restaurant dining. The Windsor Court in New Orleans gives guests the option of having meals served in courses, as do several Four Seasons properties."

As a diver in the Navy, Mr. Raynolds served on the first team to jump from helicopters into the ocean, an operation that led to the genesis of the U.S. Navy S.E.A.L.S. Mr. Raynolds graduated from Williams College and continued to a career in car dealerships in California, then returned to government service, spending four years with the U.S. Intelligence Service in Ghana, West Africa. His following careers included investment banking with Butcher & Sherrerd in Philadelphia before becoming President and CEO of the Outward Bound USA, a position he held from 1981 until 1991. During his ten years as CEO, Outward Bound's enrollment increased from 7,000 to over 30,000 students per year. A lifelong mountaineer, Mr. Raynolds was a member of the American Alpine Club and the Explorers Club. The Wall Street Journal was intrigued by his unusual combination of corporate and not-for-profit careers and did a feature article on him, entitled ""The Stew Pot Theory of Career Building"", and CNN produced a 30-minute special on him in their program ""Pinnacle"", which aired internationally. John F. Raynolds III was born in Minneapolis, MN on September 25, 1929 to John Fiske Raynolds II and Valeria Blunt Raynolds.

Which may seem customary in the People's Republic of Boulder - except that the warehouse isn't a new cocktail bar exactly but rather Boulder Distillery, one of the many small spirit producers that are multiplying all over the state. Steve and Terri Viezbicke started this one in 2008 with 303 Vodka, made from Steve's Polish grandfather's recipe, then branched out into potato whiskey (the first of its kind). Because Colorado law allows distilleries to sell what they make right from their plant, the tasting room - a bar in a corner of the distilling floor strung with lights and lined with potato sacks - slings pickletinis and bloody Marys and sells bottles of its spirits all weekend long."

2011-11-20T00:00:00Z,"To the Sports Editor: For all of the fault attributed to Joe Paterno and the leadership at Penn State for failing to stop Jerry Sandusky, the former defensive coordinator who is charged with sexual abuse of boys over 15 years, a question is not being asked. Why are the police and the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare that interviewed Sandusky in 1998 not coming under the same criticism? They interviewed Sandusky, and he stated then that he was wrong to shower with boys. Do we need more admission of guilt? Joseph Moore Jr. Pittsburgh To the Sports Editor: Lost in all the reaction to the indictment of Jerry Sandusky and its aftermath is the collective amnesia of America of all the good that Penn State students do. As we all know by now, the students were not responsible for the scandal; they are without blame. Penn State is so much more than football and its coaches. Students and alumni are on track to raise more than $500,000 for the victims of abuse. Jed Kirsch Plainview, N.Y. To the Sports Editor: Even if it turns out that Joe Paterno complied with Pennsylvania's child abuse reporting laws, his moral conscience and compass failed him severely. Losing his job as head coach, ending his career in public disgrace and tarnishing his family name are all just punishments that will forever weigh heavily on his heart. But Paterno's suffering will always pale compared with that of the abuse victims. ALAN GUTTMAN Washington To the Sports Editor: Penn State will be judged less for the heinous acts that a trusted coach may have committed, but more for the silence spanning more than 10 years that allowed the crimes to continue. One hopes that the students of Penn State are not further harmed by lasting tarnish. PAM HOLLAND Chevy Chase, Md."

2011-11-20T00:00:00Z,"AMERICAN GRAFFITI The windowless cinder block warehouses of Miami's Wynwood neighborhood have long served as blank canvases for local graffiti writers. But in recent years, a group of street artists has turned the formerly industrial area into a grass-roots answer to the annual Art Basel Miami Beach fair. After starting with five murals in 2006, they formed an organization, Primary Flight, to sponsor more of them. Five pieces became 35 the following year, 85 the next. ''The idea was, Let's take the street art out of the gallery and put it back into its natural environment,'' explains Books Bischof, the group's founder. With some 200 murals now wallpapering Wynwood (including Adrian Sonni's, above), these few square miles have become one of the largest open-air street-art installations in the world. In a reversal of the usual progression, the graffiti has led to commercial development. With the gallery giant Jeffrey Deitch, Tony Goldman - one of the driving forces behind SoHo - created Wynwood Walls (NW Second Avenue, between 25th and 26th Streets), a more tightly curated and manicured exhibition of murals. This fall Wynwood adds a much-anticipated performance space, the Light Box at Goldman Warehouse (404 NW 26th Street), and, during Art Basel, a pop-up store next to the Wynwood Walls grounds where a book of the murals photographed by Martha Cooper will be sold. For visitors who want to see all of the neighborhood's murals in two hours, the guides at Roam Rides offer graffiti tours by jewel-tone Vespa."

2011-11-20T00:00:00Z,"Like most creatures on earth, humans come equipped with a circadian clock, a roughly 24-hour internal timer that keeps our sleep patterns in sync with our planet. At least until genetics, age and our personal habits get in the way. Even though the average adult needs eight hours of sleep per night, there are ''shortsleepers,'' who need far less, and morning people, who, research shows, often come from families of other morning people. Then there's the rest of us, who rely on alarm clocks. For those who fantasize about greeting the dawn, there is hope. Sleep experts say that with a little discipline (well, actually, a lot of discipline), most people can reset their circadian clocks. But it's not as simple as forcing yourself to go to bed earlier (you can't make a wide-awake brain sleep). It requires inducing a sort of jet lag without leaving your time zone. And sticking it out until your body clock resets itself. And then not resetting it again."

2011-11-20T00:00:00Z,"COLLECTIVE BARGAINING As most anyone in Palm Beach will tell you, many of the pastel city's fortunes were managed by Bernie Madoff, and it's tempting to think that this is why its upscale consignment shops are teeming with loot. New York decorators haven't picked over the more than 40 antiques stores on West Palm's South Dixie Highway, known as Antique Row, where midcentury modern is almost as common as vintage rattan. The 8,000-square-foot Objects20c and its loft upstairs (3611 South Dixie Highway; 561-659-0403) offer everything from Eames chairs to Stickley mission furniture. Faustina Pace Antiques (3633 South Dixie Highway; 561-804-6682) mixes Swedish and French industrial pieces, while Cashmere Buffalo (3709 South Dixie Highway; 561-659-5441) has mod, Asian and African antiques. Coco House & Co. (3625 South Dixie Highway; 561-305-3157; cocohouseandcompany.com) specializes in whimsical English bamboo furniture, which holds up well in the Florida sun. A popular pit stop for decorators, Rhythm Cafe (3800 A. South Dixie Highway; 561-833-3406) is a campy former 1950s drugstore that serves an excellent Earl Grey ice cream. Serious collectors will want to stay at Hotel Biba (320 Belvedere Road; 561-832-0094), a cheerful, kitsch-filled motor lodge from the 1940s with easy access to Antique Row. For the definitive Palm Beach experience, check in at the very grand and recently restored Breakers Palm Beach (One South County Road; 888-273-2537), where courtyard boutiques carry Loeffler Randall, Repetto and K. Jacques shoes alongside the requisite Tory Burch and Lilly Pulitzer prints."

2011-11-20T00:00:00Z,"Most foreigners who come to the south of France think of Marseille as an exit or entry point. It's convenient, only an hour's drive from Avignon and the hill towns of the Vaucluse and so many other lovely places in Provence. In Marseille's small airport, you buy a 1 euro cup of machine coffee and you get on a plane headed for Paris or home, your mind filled with one version of France: idyllic little towns with churches and castles, lush green valleys, fruit trees in serried ranks, Provencal linens, village markets, antiques, lace, espadrilles, vineyards, lavender, handcrafted pates, local wines, artisanal goat cheese. But I like to leave the airport behind and drive another 20 minutes. As I come round a bend in the highway, a very different France pops up in front of me. After the rest of Provence, Marseille's cityscape is a giant reality check - an affront to the storybook country. Yes, the usual orange-tiled roofs spill down a hill to the city center, but vast housing projects are scattered throughout the north side of town, and huge, serious ships sit in Marseille's modern port, a dozen or so cranes and forklifts towering over it, lifting and turning, testimony to construction and economic activity. Unlike the rest of the country, for Marseille, it's all about the water; the land has very little to do with the life of the place."

What Mr. Boeke saw, in his mind's eye, was a residential community that would blend in with that 10-mile stretch, with its jagged rocks, redwoods, pines and Monterey cypresses."

Yet in the early stages of this season, with his body refusing to cooperate with the master plan, Fish began to despair. At age 29, which is advanced for a 21st-century tennis professional, Fish knew the moment to make a major move was now, but despite all the training and ambition, he was mysteriously low on energy."

Was that appealing? No. I never wanted to be some sort of socialite, and I don't think that's what Mark wanted. He always told me that one of the reasons he liked me so much from the beginning is because I wore a Timex. When I read about the December 2010 suicide of your husband, I remember being disturbed by the image of him hanging himself with the family dog's leash. Does this still haunt you? It haunts me every time I have to walk the dog and every night when I try and go to bed. What haunts me most is that he tried it with a vacuum-cleaner cord first, and it didn't work, and he tried again. The determination of it is gruesome."

''I'm a woman designing a men's wear brand,'' Ms. Lee said. ''I can't wear the clothes, so I'll ask 10 different guys how something feels on instead.'' Giving men exactly what they want is exactly why Unis has earned a loyal following since it's opening in 2000. The label is known for deceptively simple shirting, outerwear, pants and knits, as Ms. Lee's obsessive tweaks and improvements elevate everything above similar brands and their mass market counterparts.

2011-11-20T00:00:00Z,"Nothing causes New Orleanians to wake up in night sweats like the prospect of their beloved city turning into a Houston or an Atlanta or some other well-adjusted city. Of course, there is little to be gained by becoming a quaint still life, either, and it is this tension - between adopting from the outside and holding on to what makes New Orleans what it is - that has governed the past six years of recovery. While the city itself is still trying to find the balance, a wave of new cocktail bars, gastropubs and hotels are striking it in their own way. Housed in a former firehouse on a dimly lit corner in the Uptown neighborhood, Cure (4905 Freret Street; 504-302-2357) is TriBeCa on the Mississippi. Ambitious in its mixology and earnestly hip in its presentation, the bar serves Jamaican meat pies and baked crabcakes alongside a cocktail menu heavy on house-made bitters. Cure is among the first of the city's new craft cocktail bars, and its peers are plenty, including the retro-styled Bouligny Tavern (3641 Magazine Street; 504-891-1810), which has clever drinks like the Sage Julep and refined bar food. The more adventurous can head to the barely marked Twelve Mile Limit (500 South Telemachus Street; 504-488-8114) in Mid-City, owned by a bartender formerly of Coquette, one of the city's upscale bistros. Inside it looks like a proper dive - jukebox, pool table, well-worn sofa - but one that makes inventive cocktails, barbecue-inspired cuisine and superb doberge cake. The French Quarter is generally avoided by the young and cool, but then came Sylvain (625 Chartres Street; 504-265-8123), where locals go for comfortable cuisine done smartly, like porchetta po' boys. There's music, too, a short stroll downriver at Three Muses (536 Frenchmen Street; 504-298-8746), where you can order a Spaghetti Western - Bourbon, orange-infused Campari and rosemary syrup - and listen to a tattooed lady sing Bessie Smith standards."

2011-11-20T00:00:00Z,"I'd taken an apartment for the summer in Coney Island to write but found myself staying on after Labor Day. After writing my quota for the day and having no money to spend on whatever people spend money on (movies? bars? apartments in vitrine buildings with dedicated bicycle storage, where each unit comes complete with a spare office set aside for each couple's eventual parturition?), I'd taken to walking at night. Some nights there was a moon; other nights there was no moon; always there was Lower New York Bay, called, by the geographically oblivious, the Ocean. On nights with no moon it was so dark out there the weather and wake seemed one. The dark thwack of sneakers on planks. The soft boards whose knots are black gum. That night there was a scud of red up ahead, where the boardwalk swerves like a D.U.I. at Ocean Parkway. I went toward that blinking light -- it was a truck, backed up to the beach. A slow, short old man stood with a shovel on the sand three steps down. His nose was inverted, in a sense; it resembled a thumbprint like one a cop would take but not in ink, in concrete. He was digging down and then, weak with the weight of each load, shoveling the sand into large bags and then flinging the bags into the back of his truck."

2011-11-20T00:00:00Z,"The face of single parenthood in the United States has long been defined by the image of a woman, often struggling with challenges like divorce, desertion, poverty and the scarcity of good child care if she is employed. Indeed, according to census figures compiled this year, of the 11.8 million single parents living with children under age 18 in the United States, 10 million, or 85 percent, were mothers. But the number of families headed by single fathers has been growing faster than the number headed by mothers only or by married couples, according to the Census Bureau. The ranks of single fathers in the nation totaled 1.7 million, or 15 percent, of single parents, according to data collected this year. That number has grown steadily since 1970, when there were about 400,000 single fathers."

Over the next few days, interns and residents furiously adjust his medications and fix his diet. He is discharged with a stack of prescriptions. A week or two later, chances are good he'll be right back in the emergency room.

Hughes says Rome has been ''gutted by the huge and ruthless takeover of its imagination by mass tourism.'' Its television is ''crap,'' its civic experience ''brutally compromised by automobile and driver.'' The city that wasn't built in a day (try 2,500 years) refuses to be understood in the space of ''a decade or a guided bus ride.''"

2011-11-20T00:00:00Z,"Every time we put together a travel issue, we look over the pictures that have been taken for the various stories and appoint a single image as the ''jigsaw puzzle.'' We usually can spot it on sight: an insanely detailed, entirely magnificent, wickedly diverse in its minutiae, panoramic view of an exotic place; something that could still render some surprises when shattered into a thousand bits. For this issue, the choice of one was not so easy. There were the streets of Kolkata (Page 130) by Max Vadukul, with their crowds, bright taxis, quirky signage and painted shutters. There was Vava Ribeiro's Ecuadorean cloud forest (Page 136) with its lush diverse growths and vibrant denizens. From Moab, Utah (Page 122), Cass Bird turned in humorous and epic shots of Heidi Mount among mountains of rocks. (How many shades of pink and red can one find in sandstone?) Our favorite jigsaw photographs, though, came from François Deladerrière. They are of Marseille (Page 142), and they accompany Amy Wilentz's terrific essayistic tour of France's second-largest city. What we found so wonderful about them is that they forced us to look more closely, and with real delight, at a cityscape we knew well.

It was still under construction as we stepped into a titanic inner chamber with a high pitched roof, the last light of the day streaming dramatically through a long, narrow skylight at the peak, allowing the 30 or so builders to keep working. Several of them cheerfully called down to us from their tinkertoy-like scaffolding as we picked our way through the piles of construction materials. ''We're building the Big Tree cathedral,'' Ripple said. And they're doing it almost entirely out of bamboo. Not only will the three-story, 23,500-square-foot structure be the world's largest commercial building made out of bamboo, but it also might just be the most Wonkaesque. From the outside, the factory resembles a giant Balinese handicraft - like an apartment-building-size basket or a giant crocheted toy barn. The facade and some interior walls are woven from bamboo strips, and the roof is made of dried alang-alang grass. Ripple said the walls had to be coated with food-grade sealant in order to meet building codes for a commercial food-processing plant. ''And we have about 10,000 fire extinguishers stashed away,'' he said with a laugh."

He is best known for his willful distortions of the human figure, from the Constructivist ''maternity dress'' he made for his longtime muse Grace Jones to any number of his Ektachrome collages in which the likes of Bjork or his wife, Karen Park, appear far greater than the sum of their body parts. Included in the exhibition is a clip from a 1972 ''Mike Douglas Show'' episode, in which the artist tries to deconstruct his method to the clueless host.

Beloved husband of Mary Reusche for 61 years; loving father of Emily Reusche Selbe, Anne (David) Reusche, and Alec (Tracy) Reusche; devoted grandfather to Bob Selbe, Melissa, Ted and Tom Reusche, and Kiel and Lily Marzahl; dear uncle; cherished brother-in-law; and devoted friend and colleague to many. Bob graduated from Ohio State in 1949 and received his MBA from the University of Chicago in 1955. He retired as vice chairman of the Northern Trust Company in 1990 after a 39-year career in the trust department, including 18 years at its helm. Bob was a senior advisor at the Chicago Community Trust; founder of the Lake County Community Foundation; founding board member of the Health Foundation of Northern Lake County; life trustee and chairman of the Ravinia Festival; chairman of PADS of Lake County; trustee of the West Virginia chapter of The Nature Conservancy; board director of St. Ignatius College Prep; board director of the Lumen Christi Institute of Catholic Thought at the University of Chicago; board president of the Policeman's Annuity and Benefit Fund of the City of Chicago; and life member of the Commercial Club. An avid supporter of his alma mater, Bob served Ohio State in numerous leadership capacities including board member of the University Foundation; member of the College of Arts and Sciences Advisory Board; and founding member of the Humanities Dean's Advisory Committee. As part of his legacy at Ohio State, Bob established lacrosse as a competitive sport in 1949 and in recent years provided counsel and support to the team. Donations may be made to the Robert F. Reusche Memorial Fund at the Lake County Community Foundation, 114 South Genesee Street, Suite 505, Waukegan, IL 60085."
2011-11-20T00:00:00Z,"Chargers (4-5) at Bears (6-3) Sunday, 4:15 p.m. Line: Bears by 3.5 . Lovie Smith does not get the credit he deserves. His coaching staff is filled with temperamental geniuses who have impulse control issues. The offense is loaded with divas: when Roy Williams comes across as normal, you know you are dealing with some Timothy Leary-level team chemistry. On paper, Smith's blitzed-up take on the stodgy Cover-2 defense, built around the talents of 30-something linebackers, looks about as dangerous as a Toyota Celica with mag wheels. This is a team that strives to beat opponents with punt returns, for heaven's sake. Yet Smith has coaxed winning records out of this collection of disparate parts and quarrelsome personalities four times in the last six years, and he currently has a team that was universally overlooked in the preseason in the thick of the wild-card race. Norv Turner has also mixed playoff runs with .500 seasons during his Chargers tenure, but he has done so under much more favorable conditions: his division is much softer, he has an indisputable franchise quarterback and he does not have to hold the reins on assistants like Mike Martz. Turner needs everything to break right to win, and this year nothing has. The Chargers' offensive line has been torn apart by injuries, with Marcus McNeill (neck) and Louis Vasquez (foot) unlikely to play Sunday and the All-Pro Kris Dielman (concussion) out for the year. Philip Rivers' mysterious slump is not so mysterious when his blockers are Brandyn Dombrowski and Scott Mruczkowski and his receivers include castoffs like Patrick Crayton. Turner cannot win when his quarterback is throwing interceptions, whereas Smith is only now learning what it is like to win otherwise: that is as clear a contrast as you need between these two teams. Pick: Bears."

2011-11-20T00:00:00Z,"It was a misty May morning near Moab, Utah, and I was marveling at a rock: Fisher Towers, to be exact, an enormous hunk of rosy sandstone eroded over the centuries to resemble the fortress of a hermetic medieval wizard who happened to settle in southern Utah. I had pitched a tent in a campground ($12 a night) in the valley below with an outdoorsy friend. We slept next to the Colorado River. There was an outhouse, a Dumpster and a fire pit. What had led me to this holiday? Perhaps it was Edward Abbey's ''Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness,'' his 1968 account of being a park ranger in nearby Arches National Park, which chronicles the seasons he spent patrolling vast expanses of rock and shrub and having passive-aggressive dealings with various critters. Perhaps it was the idea of turning ''luxury'' on its head: I would wear only Tevas (purchased on Moab's main street) and worn-out clothes with wicking; the chic local boutique would sell rocks; there would be no shower. Yet what wind and rain had conspired to create over the centuries - crazily beautiful friezes, surreal statuary, squint-and-you-could-be-in-the-Valley-of-the-Gods enormities, and arches galore - would make for a holiday of unreal privilege and glamour.

That makes it easy enough to complain, and I'm not alone in doing so routinely. Nothing tastes the way it used to. Even pricey restaurants have lost their glow. Quality is shot. People die from eating melons. The dominance of hyper-processed, industrialized food (and, more to the point, food-like products) is spreading globally, and we're all gaining weight faster than ever, while wrecking the planet. Nevertheless, it's nearly as easy to find signs of hope -- lots of them -- as well as people and organizations who've been prodding American food back on a natural, sustainable, beautiful track."

2011-11-20T00:00:00Z,"It can feel as though you've somehow gone back in time when you're driving up the looping curves of Route 17 in northern Vermont and take one last turn, toward the spine of the Green Mountains, to suddenly find what appears to be the movie set of a small 1960s ski resort brought painstakingly to life. There is a cluster of quaint yellow and blue rustic clapboard buildings. A rutted dirt parking lot. A single-chair lift rising into the clouds over narrow trails that seem to pitch and hurtle down the mountain. Here at Mad River Glen, you won't find high-powered quad chairlifts or gondolas. You'll find hardly any snow making or grooming. And you won't find snowboards at all - they aren't allowed. What you will find is a cult of simplicity and rugged outdoorsmanship, and a form-follows-function aesthetic in which some of the best skiers in the country are often kitted out in a kind of duct-tape-and-deerskin-gloves reverse chic. They pray at the altar of natural snow and are impatient with the kind of spoon-feeding that many ski resorts serve up these days, in which the bumps are literally smoothed out for their customers. ''The skiing is so different from the places where everything is just like a big superhighway because it's been plowed or groomed,'' says Elliot Wiener, an attorney from Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., who's been coming here for years. ''You get to Mad River Glen and it's like driving the back roads. What would you rather do - drive the interstate or drive the back roads?''"

2011-11-20T00:00:00Z,"Like most creatures on earth, humans come equipped with a circadian clock, a roughly 24-hour internal timer that keeps our sleep patterns in sync with our planet. At least until genetics, age and our personal habits get in the way. Even though the average adult needs eight hours of sleep per night, there are ''shortsleepers,'' who need far less, and morning people, who, research shows, often come from families of other morning people. Then there's the rest of us, who rely on alarm clocks. For those who fantasize about greeting the dawn, there is hope. Sleep experts say that with a little discipline (well, actually, a lot of discipline), most people can reset their circadian clocks. But it's not as simple as forcing yourself to go to bed earlier (you can't make a wide-awake brain sleep). It requires inducing a sort of jet lag without leaving your time zone. And sticking it out until your body clock resets itself. And then not resetting it again."

Directed by Scott Elliott and written by Erika Sheffer, the play focuses on a Russian family living in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, and struggling to assimilate to American life. Ms. Garofalo will portray Diana, a wife and mother of two. In a telephone interview, she said she was ''as surprised as anyone'' about the casting. But it wasn't any kind of comedy-to-drama genre barrier that caught her off guard. ''I don't speak Russian,'' she said. ''The character is a Russian immigrant who speaks Russian so I double-checked that that was the part I was supposed to do.'' Nonetheless, Ms. Garofalo was drawn to the production by the strength of the script and was convinced by Mr. Elliott that she could play the part. ''I could probably fake my way through using broken English with a Russian accent, but he has this way of convincing you that you can do anything,'' she said. ''It's an exciting challenge, but at the same time I am terrified about seeming like the biggest fraud in the world.''"

The works to be inducted in 2012 are an unusually diverse lot, ranging from Cole Porter's ''Anything Goes,'' a single from 1934, and the Rolling Stones' ''Exile on Main Street,'' an album from 1972, to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's historic ''I Have a Dream'' speech, taken from a spoken-word album issued in 1963, and the influential ''Anthology of American Folk Music,'' from 1952. The selections are particularly heavy in recognizing old blues songs that, though minimized as ''race records'' when originally released in 78-rpm versions, went on to influence later generations of popular musicians. The songs in that category include such blues standards as Bukka White's ''Fixin' to Die'' and Big Bill Broonzy's ''Key to the Highway,'' both released on the Okeh label in the early 1940s, as well as Leroy Carr's ''How Long, How Long'' and Furry Lewis's ''Kassie Jones,'' both from 1928.

In 1989, Frank created the Garden Conservancy, a national organization dedicated to saving exceptional American gardens. He personally gathered support and respect for the fledgling organization, traveling tirelessly to spread the word, and was responsible for the Conservancy's early success and leadership in the field.

The garden in Canada was the subject of his award-winning book, The Greater Perfection, and was described as ""the most aesthetically satisfying and horticulturally exciting landscape experience in North America."" Frank was honored by horticultural groups around the world, and was a sought-after speaker and advisor to many more. We will all miss Frank's vision, dedication, and generosity; he was an inspiration.

2011-11-22T00:00:00Z,"The scheduled opening next year of the National September 11 Memorial Museum has been delayed because of a $156 million dispute between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the foundation responsible for running the museum, according to people familiar with the discussions. The Port Authority, which is responsible for the construction, has stopped approving new contracts, slowing work on the underground museum, which was to open on Sept. 11. The organizations have been arguing over the money for nearly 18 months, and tensions rose recently as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has sought to exert more control over construction projects in the city. Last month Mr. Cuomo nominated one of his deputies, Patrick Foye, to run the Port Authority and asked the agency to take over the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, a joint city and state enterprise that has been working on the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site. The National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center Foundation, whose chairman is Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, has maintained that poor management and delays by the Port Authority between 2006 and 2008 cost it more than $100 million. The delay in approving construction contracts was reported by The Wall Street Journal on Monday. Michael Frazier, the foundation's communications director, said Monday, ''We are working with the leadership of the Port Authority to come to an immediate resolution that allows this historic project to move forward.'' Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said, ''We're working cooperatively with New York City and the memorial foundation'' and that ''work is continuing.''"

Olivia has an exceptional way of capturing the sweet side of being a teenager. Her photos are romantic and innocent-seeming, even when the kids in the pictures are doing not-so-innocent things. So of course we thought she'd be perfect to shoot our cover story about sex-positive sex education. The concept was to illustrate teenage lust without actually showing anything. No faces and nothing explicit, just gestures."

We love Adidas sandals. The original three-stripe slip-ons feel so right again, especially when given with an Eres bikini in a small-batch tote by the Los Angeles designer Jesse Kamm. This holiday season nothing is too obvious, everyday or inexpensive to please even the most discerning friend or relative.

Wading into treacherous territory in Republican primary politics just as he is climbing in polls, Mr. Gingrich said during a nationally televised debate that he would support allowing some illegal immigrants -- those who had been in the country for decades, had paid taxes and had raised families here -- to remain in the country. Mr. Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, warned that the party could not claim a family-friendly mantle if it was to ''adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here a quarter-century.''"

Mr. Kjartansson (above, at the 2009 Venice Biennale) received the award from Lou Reed at a crowded party on Monday at the Bowery Hotel, where the Performa grand finale took place. The award, which comes with a $10,000 prize, is named for Malcolm McLaren, the artist, provocateur and sloganeer who died last year, leaving a legacy that included organizing the punk-rock band the Sex Pistols. The award is to be presented at each biennial to an artist 40 or younger who has ''demonstrated the most innovative and thought-provoking performance during the three-week biennial,'' according to a news release from Performa. Mr. Kjartansson won for his 12-hour work ''Bliss,'' performed without a break at the Abrons Arts Center on the Lower East Side from noon until midnight on Saturday.

2011-11-23T00:00:00Z,"Mitt Romney's campaign began broadcasting its first television ad in New Hampshire on Tuesday - the same day that President Obama visited the state to talk about his plan to turn around the economy. THE SCRIPT The words, ''On October 16, 2008 Barack Obama Visited New Hampshire,'' flash across the screen before spliced video of Mr. Obama's campaign in 2008 begins: ''Thank you. Thank you New Hampshire. How is everybody doing today? I am confident that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. Who's been in charge of the economy? We need a rescue plan for the middle class. We need to provide relief for homeowners. It's going take a new direction. If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.'' As Mr. Obama speaks, the words, ''He failed,'' flash across the screen, before the ad switches to Mr. Romney, who says: ''I'm going to do something to government. I call it the smaller, simpler, smarter approach to government. Getting rid of programs, turning programs back to states and, finally, making government itself more efficient. I'm going to get rid of ObamaCare. It's killing jobs. And it's keeping our kids from having the bright prospects they deserve. We have a moral responsibility not to spend more than we take in. I'll make sure that America is a job-creating machine like it has been in the past. It's high time to bring those principles of fiscal responsibility to Washington, D.C.

2011-11-23T00:00:00Z,"6 P.M. (ABC Family) CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005) Tim Burton's sugar rush, based on Roald Dahl's book (with, above from left, David Kelly, Freddie Highmore, Johnny Depp, Deep Roy, Jordan Fry and Adam Godley), stars Mr. Depp as an oddly sinister candymaker and Mr. Highmore as a boy who wants nothing more than to swim in chocolate. Well, who wouldn't? Despite burdening Wonka with a psychological back story and forcing a redemptive father-son reconciliation onto Dahl's tale -- ''worse than lazy; it is a betrayal of a book that the filmmakers seem otherwise to have not only understood, but also honored,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times -- ''the sumptuous, eerie look and mood of the movie make it possible to ignore this dispiriting and superfluous adherence to convention.'' He added: ''There is simply too much pleasure to be found in Wonka's world to get too hung up about his relationship with his dad. The real lesson of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is -- or should be -- that pleasure and curiosity are their own rewards.'' ''Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,'' Mel Stuart's 1971 adaptation with Gene Wilder in the title role, Peter Ostrum as Charlie, and songs by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse, follows at 8:30. 7:15 A.M. (Cinemax) FANTASTIC MR. FOX (2009) George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray lend their voices to this animated tale from Wes Anderson, adapted with Noah Baumbach from the ''anti-fable'' by Roald Dahl about a fox that rallies his animal friends against three evil farmers. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott said the movie was in some ways Mr. Anderson's ''most fully realized and satisfying film,'' adding that, ''once you adjust to its stop-and-start rhythms and its scruffy looks, you can appreciate its wit, its beauty and the sly gravity of its emotional undercurrents.'' Is it a movie for children? Mr. Scott wonders. ''It is precisely the movie that a child smitten with Roald Dahl's fiction and fascinated by the enigmas of the adult world would dream of making: something to amaze and terrify the grown-ups and win the envy and adulation of his peers.''"

Grab the Spotlight ''Attention span is the issue,'' said Mr. Boyd. You have to engage attention long enough to get your shot. ''It's critical that you be entertaining,'' he said. ''I'm not a standup comic by any stretch, but I am going to joke around.'' He has a routine of patter, in which what you say isn't as important as some brisk chat . ''Let's all get in a little closer. Too tight, John, you're too tall! Back row,'' demonstrated Mr. Boyd. ''I am talking the whole time, giving direction, and not giving them too much time to think.''"
2011-11-24T00:00:00Z,BEIJING -- It is rare that marquee international film events take place in China. That is partly because of the censorship imposed by the government. And tight limits on importing and screening foreign movies cast a shadow on efforts to bring new films to the nation. But last week's arts and culture forum organized by Asia Society and the Aspen Institute sought to broaden the dialogue concerning films from the United States and China.
2011-11-24T00:00:00Z,"John Landis, below, secured a place in the pop-culture canon by directing a series of blockbusters in the late 1970s and '80s that often starred some of the country's biggest comedians. His films were zany, sometimes outrageous: ''Animal House'' (1978), ''The Blues Brothers'' (1980), ''Trading Places'' (1983), ''Three Amigos'' (1986) and ''Coming to America'' (1988). Earlier this week the Brooklyn Academy of Music's BAMcinématek began a retrospective of his work called See You Next Wednesday. Mr. Landis talked to Mekado Murphy about his motivation for making films, working with actors and mining a script for laughs. Q. Did you set out to make movies that had broad appeal?"

2011-11-24T00:00:00Z,"Packers at Lions Thursday, 12:30 p.m. Line: Packers by 6.5. The Lions have a 33-79 record entering their Thanksgiving game since 2001, but that does not mean you have to go back to the days of Bobby Layne to find a time when they were relevant. In 2007, the Lions reached Thanksgiving with a 6-4 record, an exciting offense built around receivers Calvin Johnson - then a rookie - and Roy Williams, and a stingy defense coached by Rod Marinelli. That team was poised to render Lions punch lines obsolete until they allowed Brett Favre to throw three touchdowns in a 37-26 loss that was not as close as the final score. Instead of using their traditional holiday appearance to launch a playoff run, the Lions collapsed: they went 3-30 between that day and Thanksgiving of 2009."

2011-11-24T00:00:00Z,"''The very nicest thing Hollywood can possibly think of to say to a writer,'' Raymond Chandlerwrote, ''is that he is too good to be only a writer.'' Chandler may have been only a writer himself, but he was a singularly influential one, whose body of work includes the classic detective novels ''The Big Sleep'' and ''Farewell, My Lovely'' and contributions to the screenplays for ''Double Indemnity'' (written with Billy Wilder) and ''Strangers on a Train.'' Now a sale of books and papers from Chandler's personal collection offers a unique look at his legacy and literary influence, not to mention his uneasy relationship with that ''showman's paradise,'' as he called it, known as Hollywood. On Dec. 13 Sotheby's will sell at an auction in New York a collection of Chandler's books and other works from the library of Jean Vounder-Davis, who was the author's fiancee and secretary until his death in 1959, the auction house said on Wednesday. Among the items in the sale is a copy of ''The Big Sleep,'' the first novel to feature his detective character Philip Marlowe, inscribed to Chandler's wife, Cissy. (The dedication reads in part, ''For my Cissy who wants something much better, but was pleased even with this.'') Another copy of ''The Big Sleep'' also for sale at the auction is dedicated by Chandler to himself, with the inscription, ''For me without my compliments.''"

2011-11-24T00:00:00Z,"A lawsuit filed by 44 survivors and the families of 4 people who were killed when a stage collapsed in August at the Indiana State Fair has named the country band Sugarland in the suit, along with producers and other organizers of the concert, The Associated Press reported. Sugarland, the country music duo of Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, was minutes away from performing at the fairgrounds in Indianapolis on the evening of Aug. 13 when a gust of wind that exceeded 60 miles per hour caused the stage to collapse. The accident, which occurred hours after a severe thunderstorm watch was issued, resulted in the deaths of seven people and injuries to dozens more, and video of the frightening scene spread rapidly across the Internet. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Marion Superior Court in Indianapolis, says that Sugarland and the other parties involved in the concert had a duty to make it a safe environment and were in breach of reasonable care. Mario Massillamany, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that the band had the final decision about whether the show should go on, adding: ''Unfortunately, this tragedy could have been prevented if the responsible parties had been concerned about the concertgoers that night.'' Sugarland did not immediately comment on the lawsuit; the band played a free concert in Indianapolis on Oct. 28 to make up for the missed show and to help raise money for victims of the accident."

Created by Dr. Frank Lipman, the founder and director of the Eleven Eleven Wellness Center in Manhattan -- which promotes ""good medicine,"" like lifestyle changes through diet, nutrition, exercise and stress management -- this dessert complies with his challenging but not impossible 14-day-long ""Be Well"" food-and-shake cleanse ($200). The gluten-free treat substitutes unsweetened vanilla almond milk for cream and calls for organic pumpkin and a little raw honey or cinnamon in place of sugar. ""When you eat sugars, your body gets an initial surge of energy, your body scrambles to process it, and then you crash,"" Lipman says about sugar, a depression-linked carbohydrate. ""This process triggers the body to crave more sugar, and a vicious cycle of craving, eating and crashing begins."" Sounds alarmingly familiar, eh? On the bright side, Lipman does promote a lot of sleep to combat sugar cravings around the holidays. The easy-to-follow recipe is below, so you can nap and have all the taste of pumpkin pie you want this holiday season.Pumpkin Pie Smoothie - Serves 1"

Too well. Ms. Demetrakas's film bathes in Trungpa's glow and spends much time with his followers, who talk about his teachings and his impact on their lives. (He died in 1987, at 48.) But the movie goes mushy when it should be critical, and leaves you with questions that it's not prepared to answer. Trungpa escaped from Tibet in 1959 after the Chinese invasion. He studied at Oxford and opened a Tibetan center in Scotland, where he gave up his monastic vows, married a 15-year-old British girl and was partially paralyzed in a car accident. (He was probably driving drunk.) In 1970 he moved to the United States, eventually founding the Naropa Institute (now Naropa University) in Boulder, Colo."

A box could be both the introduction to, and the distillate of, a body of work. Among this year's harvest of boxed sets, compilations and reissues, some still make an effort to be selective, with musicians like Paul Simon and the members of R.E.M. winnowing their own careers, and collector-historians at labels like Now-Again and Tompkins Square organizing their greatest finds."

2011-11-25T00:00:00Z,"Enough with the cultural imperialism, already: World music no longer means fetishistic collections of traditional sounds untouched by time or modernity. Decades of syncretism have created all sorts of hybrids. The secret, though, is that those hybrids have been there all along, undernoticed by those in search of the falsely authentic. Several recent compilations prove the point, showing especially the vitality of the 1970s as an era in which funk slithered easily across borders. That's not a surprise in India, where Bollywood soundtrack music has long been one of the world's most versatile sounds. Some thundering examples are collected on ''Psych-Funk Sa-Re-Ga! Seminar: Aesthetic Expressions of Psychedelic Funk Music in India 1970-1983.'' There's lithe funk, creepy incidental music, astral singing by Asha Bhosle, and a handful of spooky, swinging R. D.

2011-11-25T00:00:00Z,"An apartment with graffiti by Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols is an important historical and archaeological site, according to a paper published in the journal Antiquity, the BBC reported. Rotten, born John Lydon, drew on the walls of the band's London apartment in 1975 because he disliked a recent redecoration. ''The tabloid press once claimed that early Beatles recordings discovered at the BBC were the most important archaeological find since Tutankhamen's tomb,'' wrote John Schofield and Paul Graves-Brown, archaeologists at the University of York. ''The Sex Pistols' graffiti in Denmark Street surely ranks alongside this and - to our minds - usurps it.'' The graffiti mainly consists of eight cartoons drawn in black marker in the upper room of the apartment, now used as offices. The authors say the drawings are ''a direct and powerful representation of a radical and dramatic movement of rebellion.'' The art depicts Mr. Lydon and other members of the band, including Sid Vicious and their manager, Malcolm McLaren. The current occupants of the house have said they have no plans to remove the graffiti. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

''The Mousetrap,'' which was first presented as a radio drama in 1947, made its West End debut at the Ambassadors Theater on Nov. 25, 1952, in a production that starred Richard Attenborough and Sheila Sim, his wife, as Detective Sergeant Trotter and the innkeeper Mollie Ralston.

Brandon Gephart of Roseville, Calif., who attended a showing of ''Breaking Dawn'' with his girlfriend, Kelly Bauman, was taken to a hospital following the scene in which the newlywed Bella (played by Kristen Stewart) delivers the daughter of her vampire husband, Edward (Robert Pattinson), as red, white and black strobes flash on the screen.

The stakes had been ratcheted up four days before Mr. Hallberg's performance in ''Sleeping Beauty'' by the news that Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev, two of the Bolshoi's young stars, were leaving for the Mikhailovsky Theater, a lesser-known house in St. Petersburg financed by the billionaire Vladimir Kekhman. The news came as a blow to Mr. Hallberg, who said that the opportunity to dance with Ms. Osipova was ''15 percent'' of the reason he had joined the Bolshoi. Mr. Kekhman, gloating over his success, told the Independent that he would poach Mr. Hallberg ''in the next year or so.''"

And are we worrying too much about the wrong types of fees -- and not enough about ones that are truly consequential? These are the five questions I posed in this weekend's Your Money column. In the wake of the Bank of America debit-card fee fiasco, it sure seems as if we need a new set of standards for what constitutes a reasonable fee. So this week, I asked some of the smartest consumers I know to weigh in on the question."
2011-11-26T00:00:00Z,"Even if you can't remember who James Bond's adversary was in a given movie or what Agent 007 was supposed to be saving the world from, you can probably recall the nifty, surreptitious and often lethal gadgets provided to him by Q, the pseudonymous tech wizard of Her Majesty's Secret Service. The character's Q division was named in Ian Fleming's novels, and a forerunner of the character, called Major Boothroyd, appears in the inaugural Bond film, ''Dr. No.'' But the avuncular Q is most closely associated with Desmond Llewelyn, the actor who played the role in 17 Bond movies beginning with ''From Russia With Love'' (in 1963) and ending with ''The World Is Not Enough.'' John Cleese took over the character briefly, and Q has so far made no appearances at all in the rebooted Bond films starring Daniel Craig. But all of that - cue that jazzy theme music - is about to change. Ben Whishaw, a star of the television miniseries ''The Hour'' and Julie Taymor's film adaptation of ''The Tempest,'' will play Q in the coming 23rd installment of the James Bond franchise, BBC News reported. Mr. Whishaw, who is also slated to play Richard II for the BBC, is a mere 31 years old to Mr. Craig's 43, marking the first time in the film series that Q will be younger than Bond. None of Q's new gadgets were immediately announced - a murderous iPhone, perhaps? - though producers have said that the new Bond movie will be called ''Skyfall,'' a decision whose implications this blog has previously addressed."

2011-11-27T00:00:00Z,"McCLURE--Douglas Bryan. Douglas Bryan McClure Pioneer in the Art of Incentive Negotiation for U.S. Corporations, dies at 63. Bryan McClure of Figure Eight Island, NC, the consummate family man, prominent civic leader, accomplished businessman, and former football standout, passed away at his beloved beachfront home with his family by his side. Bryan was a true renaissance man with a 40+ year career that spanned banking, real estate, education, and economic development. While he found success in all of these endeavors, it was in economic development a field he joined in the late 1980's as an economic development director for Northampton County, NC where he was to make his imprint, first in a series of increasingly prominent public sector jobs, including as the Chief Development Officer for the Michigan Jobs Commission, and then in the private sector as the founder of the Blair Group and ROI Consultants. A 1995 profile in the Wall Street Journal described Bryan as a ""New Breed of Site Consultant"", later capturing his essential spirit in a quoted response to a question about his aggressive negotiating style: ""When I see someone without a job, I just ache for them I want to do everything in my power to help."" Bryan's work helped create tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment. Well known for his vocabulary, sharp wit, and ability to articulate, Bryan was a sought after public speaker at many national forums. In 1991 he gave the keynote speech at the Global Economic Forum in Sao Paulo, Brazil. While his accomplishments in business, civic leadership, and football will long be remembered, his greatest legacy will be his commitment to family. Bryan was born in Valdese, NC, the son of the late Eris Louise Benfield McClure and Julius Plato McClure. He received a B.A. degree in Geography from East Carolina University and later studied at the Harvard-Kennedy School of Government, focusing on public administration. At East Carolina University, Bryan was the captain of the football team and upon graduation he was invited to play for the Miami Dolphins. Bryan was a former President of the Cape Fear Red Cross, founder of the McClure School of Real Estate, Appraiser, Broker, and active member of the Episcopal Church. He is survived by his wife of 43 years, Kathryn Walters McClure; two sons; Douglas Bryan McClure, Jr. and wife, Anne of Bluffton, SC, and English Blaine McClure and wife Colby of Raleigh, NC; three daughters, Blair McClure Husain and husband Fazle, Sara McClure Peters and husband Ryan, and Sloan McClure Overstrom and husband Alex, all of Manhattan, NY; three brothers, Bruce McClure of Anderson, SC, Greg McClure of Southport, SC, and the late Gary Scott McClure; two sisters, Judy Middleton and Deborah Randal, of Atlanta, GA; eleven grandchildren, Elizabeth, Sara, Charlotte, and Trice McClure of Bluffton, SC; Sloan, Blaine, Walker, and Shields McClure of Raleigh, NC; Harris, Hannah, and Asher Husain of Manhattan, NY; and one more on the way. A private funeral service was held at his family farm, Sweetbriar Farm in Morganton, NC on Friday, November 25. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to the St. Jude's Children's Hospital, PO Box 1000, Department 142, Memphis, TN 38148 http://www.stjude.org/"

They need to tell their stories, not be blamed for what happened, and be supported as they try to heal. It is not uncommon for them to feel they somehow caused the abuse to happen. The guilt and remorse they often feel can linger for years. Some victims never recover, and their lives are often destroyed."

2011-11-27T00:00:00Z,"GOLDSTEIN--Geoffrey Alan, 63, died November 23, 2011 at his home in Chicago, IL. At his request, no service will be held. Geoff was born August. 28, 1948, in NYC to Gerald and Syril Goldstein. He was a generous person who loved his grandson Kieran, his family, friends, all New York sports teams plus the Cubs, golf, cooking, Chinese food, Harry Potter fan fiction, Riley the corgi, wrapping presents, and diagramming sentences. In addition in October 2006, we believe Geoff actually surfed to the end of the internet. He didn't accept deliveries before 12 and wanted you to know that Geoff was spelled with a G. Geoff spent his youth in Washington Heights, New York City, went to the Bronx High School of Science, and graduated from Penn State University. He worked for A&S and Prudential but spent the bulk of his career with the Navy Resale System where he rose to become a Senior Manager in charge of the Facilities Division, responsible for worldwide Equipment and Maintenance. Geoff lived much of his life in Freehold, New Jersey until July of 1996 when he suffered a massive stroke. Through the following year he showed remarkable determination in exceeding all expectations to achieve his rehabilitation goal of living an independent life in Chicago. In his post-rehabilitation years service became increasingly important to him and he was very proud in October 2000 to receive the Outstanding Service award from the American Red Cross of Greater Chicago. He is survived by his son Robert, his daughter-in-law Kelly, his grandson Kieran, and his sister, Robin Povell. Donations may be sent to The American Red Cross of Greater Chicago Rauner Center 2200 West Harrison Street Chicago, IL 60612, 312-729-6120."

2011-11-27T00:00:00Z,"In 2008 and 2009, as the American automotive industry foundered, critics often cited Detroit's fixation with light trucks and S.U.V.'s, which had fallen out of favor as gas prices rose, for the industry's agita. A new study authored by Max Warburton of Bernstein Research, a market trends and analysis firm, suggests that automakers' fondness for big iron was, and continues to be, driven by the outsize profit margins generated by the machines. Detroit's light-truck models - namely the Ford F-Series, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups from General Motors and Chrysler's Ram - rank first through third among Mr. Warburton's list of the top 12 most profitable vehicles for their makers in the United States."

Destroyed by a civil war that lasted from 1975 to 1990, the downtown of the Lebanese capital festered like a wasteland and then, as the city began to recover, was taken over by huge construction sites. But a new city center is at last emerging.

2011-11-27T00:00:00Z,"Browns (4-6) at Bengals (6-4) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Bengals by 8.5 . The Talking Heads once sang that heaven is a place where nothing ever happens. Heaven, then, is a Browns game, a nonevent between moribund teams with few recognizable stars that ends in a 6-3, 13-12, or 14-10 final score. When not losing convincingly to good teams, the Browns challenge the devotion and attention span of fans everywhere by wasting whole afternoons in slow-motion tugs of war against fellow thrill ascetics. It takes real work to comb through the game tape and play-by-play of an entire Browns-Jaguars game, only to discover that the only quasi-interesting story lines are questions about whether a 38-yard field goal sailed just inside the right upright (it didn't) or if Jack Del Rio could explain the final Jaguars play call that gave the Browns a victory (he couldn't). Bengals games, by contrast, are full of action. The Bengals catch bombs and allow bombs. Andy Dalton completes incredible passes and attempts ill-conceived option pitches on the same drive. Defenders tackle receivers by pulling their hair. Pacman Jones has been on the roster for weeks and has done nothing loopy yet, which means that he is due. The Bengals are just good enough to lose to the Ravens and the Steelers, but they are a cut above the teams that get trapped in the Browns' tar pits. The Bengals' 27-17 victory at Cleveland in Week 1 will repeat itself, if only because the Browns are too boring to try something new. Pick: Bengals."

2011-11-27T00:00:00Z,"ARVESON--William Barnes, Professor, a longtime member of the mathematics faculty at the University of California in Berkeley, died in Berkeley on November 15 due to complications from anesthesia during surgery. Bill was 76. He was born in Oakland, CA. In his youth, Bill served on an aircraft carrier as a radar technician in the US Navy, and worked at the Naval Undersea Research and Development Center. He was a graduate of the California Institute of Technology and received his PhD from UCLA (both funded by the Navy). Bill was a Benjamin Peirce Instructor at Harvard University, and since 1968 was at UC Berkeley where he was a Professor of Mathematics. He had visiting positions in the US and world-wide, including UCLA, UCSD, Pennsylvania, Newcastle (UK), Aarhus (Denmark), Oslo and Trondheim (Norway), Stockholm, Tel Aviv, Canberra, Rio de Janeiro, Tianjin (China), and Kyoto. He also received two Miller research professor awards at Berkeley. Bill strongly inspired and influenced many researchers through his teaching, writing, and lecturing. An elegant expositor who took great care with his writing, he published 79 scholarly manuscripts and authored eight books on C*-algebras, operator algebras, spectral theory, and noncommutative dynamics. His editorial services included the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, Duke Mathematical Journal, and three decades as Editor of the Journal of Operator Theory (Romania). Always generous with his time, Bill was committed to the mentorship of young mathematicians, of whom 29 wrote their doctoral dissertations under his guidance. Many of them went on to be prominent research mathematicians in their own right. Bill was a leading expert and a highly innovative researcher in his field, an area of mathematics that underlies quantum physics and can be traced back to Heisenberg's formulation of quantum mechanics. He made many surprising discoveries, continuing to do so until nearly the end of his life. Some of his early work was only fully appreciated years after its publication. Bill pioneered the exploration of certain mysterious structures that arise in a basic way from the modeling of the irreversible dynamics of quantum systems, for example, the creation and annihilation of particles such as electrons and the strange particles found in cosmic rays. In the 1990's he opened a new front in his research, with highly original ideas for applying seemingly unrelated ""abstract"" mathematics to the efficient calculation of important quantities in quantum physics. During the past decade Bill's important contributions continued to flow as strongly as ever, and began to include applications of quantum spaces to quantum information theory and quantum computing. Bill loved jazz and the movies. Bill is survived by his wife of 26 years, Lee Ann Kaskutas, by his sons Jeff and Robert from a previous marriage, and by his miniature dachshund Bronco. All will miss him dearly, as will scores of fellow mathematicians who worked with him, learned from him, and were inspired by him."

2011-11-27T00:00:00Z,"Looking for inexpensive holiday-time getaways? Go for the dead zones: the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, or right after New Year's. Early December is often overlooked when it comes to vacation planning. But because business travel ebbs and children are in school, it is one of the best times of year to travel, with airlines, hotels and car rental companies offering deals to spur demand. (There are a few exceptions: New York, for example, is just as expensive.)"

2011-11-27T00:00:00Z,"ON my wish list, where it will remain for all eternity: Francis Kurkdjian's Extrait de Parfum, 200 milliliters. Only 20 sets exist, 10 with gold tops, 10 with platinum. You select your own name for the fragrance, which is then engraved on the bottle; said bottle lies in a box that lights up when the cabinetlike doors are opened. There's a hand-embroidered silk pouch and a gold-threaded booklet explaining how best to deploy the scent. The price is $11,000. I'll name my bottle Zuccotti Park. How does it smell, you ask? Please. This is Francis Kurkdjian, one of the finest noses on the planet. I could deconstruct the scent for you, but that wouldn't begin to describe the effect of inhaling an $11,000 perfume. Sicilian bergamot, Damascus rose, gurjum balsa (don't ask me), jasmine and the sweat of an Andalusian concubine frolicking in a field of hibiscus and saffron. O.K., I made that last one up, but you get it. Or do you? S.S. FAIR"
