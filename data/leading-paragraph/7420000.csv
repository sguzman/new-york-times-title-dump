Dick graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1941 and then joined the army stationed in Japan during WWII.

2010-10-15T22:10:42Z,"It's the duty (and, O.K., the bliss) of an opinion journalist to demonstrate that the Beltway's conventional wisdom has far fewer garments than it supposes. But on one count - that the progressives are at the moment far more marginalized by their Democratic president and Congressional leadership than are the Tea Party enthusiasts by the Republican powers-that-be - it's been hard to show contention. After all, the president who insisted that the day of his inauguration would be ""the moment when we ended a war,"" who confidently said that ""we are going to close Guantanamo"", who promised to repeal the military's don't-ask-don't-tell policy has shown, through deed if not word, that he's not exactly a hostage to the far left. Nor has the Democratic leadership: Senate majority leader Harry Reid is an apostate on a woman's alleged right to choose -- ""abortions should be legal only when the pregnancy resulted from incest or rape, or when the life of the woman is endangered"" -- and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi isn't exactly beloved."

Such technology has made the Wii the most popular of the current game systems because it allows players to avoid having to master the use of more than a dozen buttons, sticks and triggers on a modern console game controller.

Despite a brutal 1-4 performance last weekend, Paul Myerberg still holds a slim, one-game advantage over Pete Thamel. The real new No. 1 is Ohio State, which faces its first true road test tomorrow night at Wisconsin. Camp Randall is always an intimidating atmosphere, but the Buckeyes hope Terrelle Pryor and a tough defense will be enough to overcome the Badgers' stout running game. Auburn is one of the last two undefeated teams in the Southeastern Conference (Louisiana State is the other), but the Tigers looked shaky in beating Kentucky last week. They face a stiff challenge from Arkansas on Saturday. Nebraska knows what it feels like to fall from the heights of the Big 12, so the Cornhuskers could have some empathy for struggling Texas if they choose to. They probably won't though. Michigan is trying to bounce back from a loss to Michigan State, but is running right into an Iowa squad that would like to fight it out with Ohio State for Big Ten supremacy. Meanwhile, in the Pac-10, Oregon State is quietly looking to assert itself as one of the conference's top teams. It beat Arizona last week and will try to knock off a Washington squad that has already defeated Southern California. There is plenty to watch this week and much to predict. As always, if you agree, disagree or merely find our picks laughable, feel free to let us know."

Auburn hosts Arkansas with the goal of remaining unbeaten headed into next week's game against L.S.U. (Would love to see both teams undefeated for that one.)

When Baker's sources complain that their boss is being unfairly maligned by foes and friends (or ""frenemies,"" perhaps) alike, they have a point: The most strident criticisms of the Obama presidency have almost all been at least somewhat unfair, whether it's conservatives calling the president a socialist and a radical (when actually he's just a very conventional liberal), left-wingers claiming that he's a sell-out and a crypto-conservative (when actually he's accomplished more for the left than any president since L.B.J.), or D.C. insiders dismissing his political skills and salesmanship (hey, you try being a political salesman when the unemployment rate is 9.5 percent!). I'm no great admirer of Barack Obama's policies, but some of the discontent swirling around the White House at the moment is the usual cult-of-the-presidency nonsense, in which the occupant of the Oval Office is held responsible for forces and events beyond his control, and everyone pretends that the world would be perfect if he weren't so incompetent, so cowardly, or so evil."

2010-10-15T02:44:24Z,"On an unassuming side street in Paolo Sarpi, Milan's burgeoning Chinatown, Mirko Pancaldi and Davide Grosso are flying the flag for design's future being in the past. Since 2001, the pair, who collaborate under the G | Lab name, have been drawing attention for their delicately ornate furniture and lighting fixtures made from discarded aged wood and laser-cut iron. ''We are known for breathing new life into traditional materials and forms,'' Pancaldi says in the G | Lab showroom, which occasionally doubles as a workshop for average Giovannis wanting to learn time-held wood-turning and ironwork techniques. ''All of our designs refer back to 18th-century French and Italian furniture traditions, and to patterns and shapes found in nature.'' And so a slab of industrial iron becomes a filigreed room divider that is as intricate as it is commanding, and a hunk of maple found in an abandoned sawmill has a second life as a Baroque cabinet. Is this work, which often has Oriental accents, a function of the showroom's location or the result of travels to Asia? ''I've never been to Asia,'' enthuses the usually taciturn Pancaldi. ''Only the Asia of my imagination.''"

Edythe was born in New York City on July 7, 1915 and raised in Glen Falls, New York. She lived an extraordinary life in civic affairs. In 2005, on the occasion of her 90th birthday, Edythe was honored for her long years of leadership in the community with a proclamation issued by the City Council of New York. The proclamation stated ""Among the many vital contributions Ms. First made to her community, her dedication to the Civic Advisory Council of the Deputy Mayor, and was the first Chairperson of the City Commission on the Status of Women."" Edythe entered Barnard College on a scholarship at age 15 and was graduated in the class of 1934. Following her marriage to Edward First, a tax lawyer who served in the Navy in World War II, Edythe worked at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. She moved to New York City with her husband in 1955, where she began her long and distinguished career in civic affairs. In 1976 Mayor Beame appointed Edythe the First Chairperson of the Commission on the Status of Women. She also served several terms as the Chairperson of Women's City Club, an organization devoted to the concerns of all New Yorkers. She was honored by Mayor Giuliani in a ceremony recognizing her many and diverse contributions to the City of New York. Her diary is part of the collection of women's writings in the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute. Mrs. First is survived by her daughter, Susan First Pollack, an attorney, her son-in-law, Daniel A. Pollack, an attorney, two grand-children, Samuel J. Pollack of Chicago and Gabriella Pollack Mishev of San Francisco, and two-great-grandchildren, Lillian and Hannah Pollack, both of Chicago, as well as her brother Sidney Weiner of Sarasota, Florida.

2010-10-15T00:00:00Z,"O'CONNOR--Patrick Gerard, 57, died peacefully at home in Brooklyn on October 6th, 2010 from Melanoma. Patrick was born at New York Presbyterian Hospital on July 4, 1953 and grew up in Yorkville. One of his earliest childhood memories was watching the dismantling of the Third Avenue El from his bedroom window. Patrick attended St. Ignatius of Loyola Grammar School and Cardinal Spellman High School. He graduated from Lehman College in 1975. Patrick began his career in the art business while still in college, working summers for the Weintraub Gallery on Madison Avenue. He continued there full time after graduation. He was Manager of Hammer Galleries until 1986. For several years he was with Associated American Artists and then became Director of Galerie Tamenaga on Madison Avenue. When Phillips Auction House opened their New York office, Patrick joined the Impressionist and Modern Art department. Most recently he worked at J.N. Bartfield Galleries on 57th Street. Pat had a passion for art, American history, politics and baseball and he read on these subjects prolifically. Anyone entering into a discussion with Pat of these and other subjects was aware of his engaging mind, intellect and warm sense of humor. Friends and colleagues described him as humble, kind and a true gentleman. He loved his family dearly. Patrick was diagnosed in 2006 with Stage 3 Melanoma. He benefited for four years from the expertise of doctors and researchers at New York University Cancer Institute. Patrick is survived by his wife of 24 years, Antoinette Owen, his son, William P. O'Connor, his father, Patrick J. O'Connor and his brother, Martin Kevin O'Connor. He is also survived by numerous in-laws, cousins, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews in the United States and Ireland. Pat was predeceased by his mother, Margaret. A memorial mass for Patrick will take place at 10am on Saturday, October 16th, at St. Francis Xavier Church, 225 6th Avenue, Brooklyn. A celebration of his life for his many friends, colleagues and family will be held at a later date. Donations in his memory may be given to NYU Melanoma Research Fund, c/o Dr. Anna C.

Dick was born in New York City, July 3, 1920. He was a true New Yorker from his Upper West Side childhood to the Village. Although his childhood was marked by the polio epidemic, a historic custody battle, and the Great Depression, Dick was not. He saw things clearly and called it like it was. His passions were simple and deep, first and foremost his family, his Jets, excellent food, and comfortable clothing. Dick graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1941 and then joined the army stationed in Japan during WWII. He created and built what was, at the time, the largest wholesale cruise business in the United States. Dick's grandchildren, Jeff, Matthew, Brad, Scott and Melanie are the fortunate beneficiaries of his non-judgmental, pure love and pride. We will remember him with laughter and love.

Irv was a true renaissance man; world traveler, linguist, golfer, tennis player, boater, music lover (long-time patron of the Metropolitan Opera) and philanthropist. He was able to achieve all of those accomplishments in spite of having to cope with severe sight impairment for more than 50 years. His inner strength and determination allowed him to live a full life with Branna, his beloved wife of 70 years. After retiring from a successful career in business, he devoted his life to helping other sight-impaired people through the Desert Visionaires, a charity that he and Branna founded in California's Coachella Valley. Irv was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Yeshiva University in 2007 in recognition of his and his wife's support for the university's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, through their establishment of the Branna and Irving Sisenwein Chair in Ophthalmology and Visual Science. He was loved and respected by all. Irv will be missed and always remembered. Services will be held on Sunday at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York City at 1pm.

Anyone with access to a television could see that Golson had caught the ball fairly. But because baseball stubbornly refuses to allow its umpires to consult video on anything but home run calls, the blunder stood. Even though umpires now routinely consult each other in an effort to get calls right, there has been an unusually large number of mistakes on critical plays in this year's postseason, which resumes with the American League Championship Series Friday night."

Even if it didn't advance the show's meta-narrative, and even if the laughter of the live studio audience was occasionally jarring, it had a certain frantic energy, like, say, the first half-hour of a decent ''Saturday Night Live.'' The good folks over at Vulture have compiled this exhaustive list of the differences between the versions of the episode that were presented for the Eastern and Western halves of the country, and, well, it's mostly pretty subtle stuff."
2010-10-16T00:00:00Z,"1:43 p.m. | Updated LOS ANGELES-Apparently, only an ongoing union dispute in New Zealand now stands between ''The Hobbit'' and a start date in February. Warner Brothers' New Line Cinema unit and MGM have worked out their deal to finance the pair of films to be based on J. R. R. Tolkien's novel, and Peter Jackson's deal to direct is now finalized, according to a person who was briefed on the movie's intricacies this week. But continuing uncertainty over attempts to have the filmmakers bargain collectively with their actors in New Zealand still stands between the production and its planned February start date (already delayed from an anticipated January date). New Zealand officials have said the production can't legally enter a collective bargaining arrangement with its actor-contractors, but unions there have insisted that a deal could be struck. If the studios move the film out of New Zealand, the budget, which already runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars, would have to be redrawn, and at least some further delay would be inevitable."

Irv was a true renaissance man; world traveler, linguist, golfer, tennis player, boater, music lover (long-time patron of the Metropolitan Opera) and philanthropist. He was able to achieve all of those accomplishments in spite of having to cope with severe sight impairment for more than 50 years. His inner strength and determination allowed him to live a full life with Branna, his beloved wife of 70 years. After retiring from a successful career in business, he devoted his life to helping other sight-impaired people through the Desert Visionaires, a charity that he and Branna founded in California's Coachella Valley. Irv was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Yeshiva University in 2007 in recognition of his and his wife's support for the university's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, through their establishment of the Branna and Irving Sisenwein Chair in Ophthalmology and Visual Science.

2010-10-16T00:00:00Z,"When an installation by the Chinese conceptual artist Ai Weiwei opened on Tuesday at Turbine Hall, the cavernous entrance space of the Tate Modern in London, visitors were encouraged to touch and even walk on the 100 million hand-crafted porcelain sunflower seeds that gave the piece its name. But on Thursday this kind of intimate interaction stopped. Officials at the museum closed off access to ''Sunflower Seeds,'' and is now only allowing visitors to see it from a walkway above the hall. The movement of the crowds released a ''greater than expected level'' of ceramic dust, according to a statement released by the Tate, which added that it had ''been advised that this dust could be damaging to health following repeated inhalation over a long period of time.'' As a result, the museum, in consultation with the artist, ''decided not to allow visitors to walk across the sculpture.'' Sunflower seeds are a ubiquitous Chinese street snack, and in Mr. Ai's piece they are thought to represent both fellowship and the enforced conformity experienced during the Cultural Revolution, when propaganda posters depicted Chairman Mao as the sun and Chinese people as sunflowers turning toward him.

2010-10-16T00:00:00Z,"FIRST--Edythe Weiner, died peacefully of natural causes at age 95 on October 14, 2010. Her daughter, Susan First Pollack, was with her at the time of her death. Edythe was born in New York City on July 7, 1915 and raised in Glen Falls, New York. She lived an extraordinary life in civic affairs. In 2005, on the occasion of her 90th birthday, Edythe was honored for her long years of leadership in the community with a proclamation issued by the City Council of New York. The proclamation stated ""Among the many vital contributions Ms. First made to her community, her dedication to civic life is truly exceptional; she has been a Board Member of the Community Council of Greater New York, a member of the Civic Advisory Council of the Deputy Mayor, and was the first Chairperson of the City Commission on the Status of Women"". Edythe entered Barnard College on a scholarship at age 15 and was graduated in the class of 1934. Following her marriage to Edward First, a tax lawyer who served in the Navy in World War II, Edythe worked at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. She moved to New York City with her husband in 1955, where she began her long and distinguished career in civic affairs. In 1976 Mayor Beame appointed Edythe the First Chairperson of the Commission on the Status of Women. She also served several terms as the Chairperson of Women's City Club, an organization devoted to the concerns of all New Yorkers. She was honored by Mayor Giuliani in a ceremony recognizing her many and diverse contributions to the City of New York. Her diary is part of the collection of women's writings in the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute. Mrs. First is survived by her daughter, Susan First Pollack, an attorney, her son-in-law, Daniel A. Pollack, an attorney, two grand-children, Samuel J. Pollack of Chicago and Gabriella Pollack Mishev of San Francisco, and two-great-grandchildren, Lillian and Hannah Pollack, both of Chicago, as well as her brother Sidney Weiner of Sarasota, Florida. Burial is private. A memorial service will be held in the future. Any contributions in her honor should be made to the Women's City Club or the Citizens Union of New York."

FOX (2009) George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray lend their voices to this animated tale from Wes Anderson, adapted with Noah Baumbach from the ''anti-fable'' by Roald Dahl about a fox that rallies his animal friends against three evil farmers. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said the movie is in some ways Mr. Anderson's ''most fully realized and satisfying film,'' adding that, ''once you adjust to its stop-and-start rhythms and its scruffy looks, you can appreciate its wit, its beauty and the sly gravity of its emotional undercurrents.'' Is it a movie for children? Mr. Scott wonders. ''It is precisely the movie that a child smitten with Roald Dahl's fiction and fascinated by the enigmas of the adult world would dream of making: something to amaze and terrify the grown-ups and win the envy and adulation of his peers.'' 10:30 A.M.

Since 2001, the pair, who collaborate under the G | Lab name, have been drawing attention for their delicately ornate furniture and lighting fixtures made from discarded aged wood and laser-cut iron. ''We are known for breathing new life into traditional materials and forms,'' Pancaldi says in the G | Lab showroom, which occasionally doubles as a workshop for average Giovannis wanting to learn time-held wood-turning and ironwork techniques. ''All of our designs refer back to 18th-century French and Italian furniture traditions, and to patterns and shapes found in nature.'' And so a slab of industrial iron becomes a filigreed room divider that is as intricate as it is commanding, and a hunk of maple found in an abandoned sawmill has a second life as a Baroque cabinet. Is this work, which often has Oriental accents, a function of the showroom's location or the result of travels to Asia? ''I've never been to Asia,'' enthuses the usually taciturn Pancaldi. ''Only the Asia of my imagination.'' HORACIO SILVA"

Roger was one of the early leaders in the television industry, as General Manager of KTVW in Seattle, WIIC in Pittsburgh, PA, and KTVU in Oakland, CA. While at KTVU he was one of nine members of the national TV Code Review Board. In 1972 Roger was appointed by then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, to the board of the CULCON Commission, which promoted cultural and educational exchanges between Japan and the U.S. In 1973 he founded INTV to promote cooperation among independent television stations around the country. In 1974 he became President and CEO of the Television Bureau of Advertising (TVB) in New York City, the position from which he retired in 1988. During that time he served on the board of the Advertising Council and was a founder of the Media Coalition for a Drug Free America. Roger was born in Spokane, WA, on February 20, 1921 to Leland Leroy Rice and Bernice Metcalf Rice. He graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle and was called to active duty with the Marine Corps in July, 1943. Roger is survived by Molly Rice, his wife of 64 years, his daughter, Stephanie Ellis, and her husband Michael, of Lihue, Hawaii; his son Douglass Rice and his wife Cynthia Elliott, of New York City; and four grandchildren and their spouses."
2010-10-17T00:00:00Z,"LIPPMAN--Edward A.,Professor emeritus of Musicology at Columbia University, died in Teaneck, New Jersey, on June 9, 2010, two weeks after a 3-day family celebration of his 90th birthday. A gifted musician, he composed, played classical piano weekly on WNYC as a child, and later played jazz piano in a hotel band. He was an honor graduate of Clinton High School in New York City and went on to earn a B.S. from CCNY in 1942, an M.A. from NYU in 1945, and a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1952. A polymath, he taught radar to Air Force trainees after graduating from college, and later, while a graduate student, he taught the entire curriculum (which included calculus and English as well as radio and television repair) at the RCA Institutes. At various times he taught at City, Hunter, Brooklyn, and Queens Colleges and at Bryn Mawr. But it was during the 35 years he spent at Columbia (from 1954 to 1989) that he developed his original ideas on the philosophy and aesthetics of music, ideas which he elaborated in five books (one of which was translated into Chinese) and numerous articles (including three for the prestigious German music encyclopedia MGG) and reviews. When teaching, which he loved, he preferred the Socratic method interspersed with quiet humor; bursts of laughter emanated frequently from the rooms in which he held his classes. His warmth, wisdom, and humor are sorely missed by Violet, his beloved wife of 68 years, his sons Robert and Richard and their wives Marlene and Celi, his four grandchildren, Li (and her husband Richard Faustino), Philip, Julia, and Laura (and her husband Jason McCabe), and his two great-grandchildren, Mira Faustino and Conor McCabe."

2010-10-17T00:00:00Z,"It's typical of the murky legend that has accumulated around Walter Albini that no one can even agree if the design college he attended in 1957 in Turin, Italy, at the age of 16 was an all-girls school that he somehow charmed his way into -- or if he simply happened to be one of the few guys at an institution with a lot of women. One version is a lot sexier and more useful for burnishing his eminence. Not that you needed to back in the '70s, when Albini was at the height of his powers and there were only two names that got every tuned-in London design student's motor running: Chloé's Karl Lagerfeld, who still had one foot in the chrysalis, and his fellow Krizia alum Albini. If it's possible to feel nostalgic for something you've never known, then the young plotters at St. Martin's felt it for Albini's storm of polka dots, floor-grazing tea gowns in tiers of floral georgette and plaid velvet dinner suits tipped with swan feathers. His mania for the '20s and '30s, for Chanel and Poiret, for cigarette holders and Champagne buckets, only added to the élan."

Here were these esteemed professors sitting around shuffling papers, listening to each other talk endlessly, and then planning their next meeting."
2010-10-17T00:00:00Z,"VIESER--Richard William, 82, passed away peacefully on October 14th. Mr. Vieser was an esteemed corporate leader who achieved a national reputation for success in rebuilding, managing and transforming a wide range of businesses in the electronics, defense, oil and gas, automotive and medical fields. A native of New Jersey, he was among the pioneers of the leveraged buyout industry having worked with both Forstmann Little & Co and Hicks Muse before retiring in 1989. After retirement, Mr. Vieser maintained an active presence in business by serving on the boards of some twenty organizations, including prominent firms such as Varian Medical, where he served as Chairman, Fisher Scientific, Dresser Industries, Control Data Corporation, Ceridian and Viasystems. Mr. Vieser was a generous and loving husband, father, grandfather and friend. He is survived by his beloved wife of fifty-nine years, Lois (Johnson) and five adoring children, Richard (and Patricia) of Bernardsville, NJ, Cheryl (Vieser) Kleckner of Alpharetta, GA, Cynthia (Vieser) and Joseph Falco of Madison, NJ, William John David of Madison, NJ and Jaime (and Melinda) of London, UK. He also leaves behind a wide circle of family and friends, including his nine beloved grandchildren, Donald, Francecsa, David, Joseph, Anne, Katherine, Alexandra, Bella and his namesake, Richard William. Born in the Vailsburg section of Newark, New Jersey, on November 14, 1927, Mr. Vieser spent his formative years in South Orange, New Jersey, where he graduated from Columbia High School in Maplewood. He was a member of a state championship baseball team in high school and active in scouting where he attained the distinction of Eagle Scout at the age of 15. After a year at Lafayette College, Mr. Vieser entered the U.S. Army in September 1946. He served sixteen months in Korea as a member of the Army of Occupation and was discharged in April 1948. Being a proud American with unwavering patriotism, he felt these years were some of the most formative of his life. Mr. Vieser re-entered Lafayette, where he was a member of Theta Delta Chi Fraternity, serving as its President in his senior year. His business career began as a trainee at AT&T headquarters in New York City. Mr. Vieser later joined Chatham Electronics Corporation where he oversaw construction of a new factory in Livingston, New Jersey that manufactured highly specialized electron tubes used in the DEW line and other early missile warning systems across Canada and the Arctic. Mr. Vieser went on to hold major executive positions, as Chatham Electronics was part of a series of corporate acquisitions and mergers in the 1950s and 1960s, involving such major and well-known businesses as Tung Sol Electric, Wagner Electric, Studebaker and Worthington Pump Company - ultimately leading to the formation of Studebaker-Worthington. Throughout the series of corporate changes, he continued his rapid rise in leadership positions. Mr. Vieser served as Executive Vice President of StudebakerWorthington and ultimately as Chief Operating Officer. After McGraw-Edison acquired Studebaker-Worthington in 1979, he was appointed Executive Vice President and later President and Chief Operating Officer of McGraw-Edison. When McGraw-Edison was acquired by Cooper Industries, Mr. Vieser was invited to join Forstmann Little & Co. While there, he served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of three Forstmann Little companies, Lear Siegler Corporation, FL Industries and Midland-Ross Corporation. He also served as Chairman of the National Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association, where he hosted numerous foreign trade missions at the request of the U.S. State Department and received honors from the states of New Jersey, Kentucky, Alabama and Mississippi. Mr. Vieser was an avid historian and voracious reader, with a profound love for music, art and travel. He was greatly involved in historical preservation and philanthropy. Mr. Vieser was a member of the President's Council of Colonial Williamsburg and a Trustee of Winterthur Museum. Mr. Vieser was an avid golfer and a member of several golf clubs, including famed courses such as Baltusrol, Pine Valley, and Morris County in New Jersey and Ocean Forest and Sea Island in Georgia. Mr. Vieser was devoted to his family and his friends. His enormous spirit, sense of humor, kindness and love for life inspired all those who knew him. He believed life was something to be celebrated. His greatest joy was to be with his family and friends around the dinner table. He especially treasured spending time with his family at his farm in New Hampshire in front of a roaring fire or enjoying a beautiful sunset. His infectious laugh, heart-warming smile, generous heart and beautiful spirit will never leave us. Relatives and friends are invited to call Monday, October 18, 2-4 and 7-9pm at the William R. Dangler Funeral Home, 309 Springfield Ave., Summit, NJ (908-273-2323). Funeral Services will be on Tuesday, Oct. 19, 10am at Calvary Episcopal Church, Summit.

We offer our condolences to Dick's immediate family, whose sorrow we profoundly share. Observing Dick, we learned that ""a twinkle in his eye"" is no mere expression, but a metaphor for a human spirit that indefatigably seized on life's joys, and its sweetness, to the fullest. Observing Dick and Lou together, we learned that life has few greater joys than a loving and loyal kinship and brotherhood.

2010-10-17T00:00:00Z,"PAOLO PELLEGRIN Paolo Pellegrin is one of the pre-eminent photojournalists covering global conflicts, often mentioned in the same breath as war-zone daredevils like James Nachtwey or Ron Haviv. He has won eight World Press Photo awards and in 2007 was awarded the Robert Capa Gold Medal Award -- the closest thing photojournalists have to a Nobel Prize -- for his coverage of the war between Israel and Lebanon. (An example of his work is at far right.) Stories like ''Boldface Milan'' (Page 104) replenish Pellegrin's spirits so that he can plunge yet again into a place like the Gaza Strip. (''It's just one of those open wounds,'' he says of the smoldering Palestinian-Israeli conflict.) A Roman by birth -- ''We think of Milan as the enemy,'' he jokes -- Pellegrin splits his time between the Eternal City and New York."

In its place stood Sergio Deli Superette, a bodega. Since he was already there, Mr. Galmitz figured he would stay a while and draw. The result is one of the most striking images in ''My East Village,'' his portfolio of neighborhood sketches, on display at SB D Gallery on East Fourth Street through Dec. 4. In the black-inked illustrations, a group of children jump gleefully in the water of an open street hydrant, the bodega behind them, its windows plastered with lunch and lottery ticket advertisements. This quintessential image of urban summer, and its resonant sense of community, lie at the heart of Mr. Galmitz's show, a snapshot of the East Village caught between its ethnic and bohemian roots and an ever-developing future."

2010-10-17T00:00:00Z,"Breast cancer research is an undeniably worthy endeavor, but the container-loads of pink objects that have been sold to help pay for it aren't always what you'd call high design. Which is why the arrival of the Pink Wishbone Project is welcome news. Thanks to Suite New York, a Manhattan furniture showroom, Hans Wegner's famous Wishbone Chair, made in Denmark by Carl Hansen & Son, will be available in pink for the next year, with 20 percent of its sales going to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. And to draw attention to the program, Barneys New York will exhibit chairs that were customized by 20 leading women designers. (A kickoff cocktail party takes place on Thursday evening at Barneys.) The designers - Sheila Bridges, Allegra Hicks, Kit Kemp, Laura Kirar, Kelly Wearstler and Bunny Williams among them - created cushions for the chairs that are, for the most part, elegant, charming, and deferential to their iconic host. But one, by the creative director Sara Rotman, (whose weekend house was the subject of a recent column in T), is a bit more - ahem - provocative. Her cushion is inspired by a Portuguese man-of-war, with luxurious tentacles (made of suede fringe), and spikes that allude to the creature's domed shape. ''I thought the idea of beautiful, alluring but ultimately powerful and dangerous things was an appropriate source of inspiration for women fighting breast cancer,'' she said. The designers' chairs will be auctioned (you can bid on them on charitybuzz), while the chairs without cushions will be available exclusively at Suite. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

A wonderful wife, mother, grandmother and friend, Carole was a fountain of wisdom for all those fortunate enough to be touched by her compassion and understanding. A planner, a thinker, and a doer, Carole had a fantastic sense of humor and could charm the smallest child and the most elderly amongst us with her immense creativity, sharp wit and imagination. Carole stood by ""her guy"" Larry for 61 years, sharing a life filled with happiness and laughter, centered on the loving family they nurtured. Carole was the perfect partner for Larry and together they built a storied career in the entertainment business and created life long friendships around the world. They were a great team that relished telling stories of a life well lived, often completing each other's sentences. Carole had the innate ability to make people feel comfortable in her presence allowing them to express themselves deeply so that many now feel as though they've lost their best friend. Carole was a great mother to her three sons, David, Bruce and Stephen. She was adored by her six grandchildren: Samantha, Alex, Zach, Katie, Chloe and Lily, and her daughter-in-law, Joy. Daughter of Lottie Rich and Edward Kleinman, Carole was born in Brooklyn, New York were she was raised along with her cousin Michael Kleinman, who she loved like a brother.

2010-10-17T00:00:00Z,"I moved to Milan in 1949, when my parents left Piacenza to take advantage of the opportunities for work and advancement that Milan offered after the war. In spite of the depth of the attachment that I feel to the city in which I have built my career, I am always aware that Milan does have its shortcomings and that it lies at times in thrall to a prevailing mood of melancholy, which has perhaps altered its character and diminished its sense of optimism, its capacity to think big and retain the confidence to accomplish its ambitions. As the Italian capital of financial activity and the world capital of fashion, design and opera, Milan derives its unique strength, I believe, from its capacity to promote a continuous flow of creative ideas and harness them into successful commercial ventures. I love this city most when its sense of discipline is evident, expressed through its citizens' work ethic and ability to plan on a large scale. I also love its rational approach -- one driven by passion and generosity. (It's no coincidence that Milan is the center of the nation's charitable sector.) I hope that the optimism and the characteristic determination of the Milanese will provide a much-needed stimulus to the public sector, because the greater one's love for a city, the more one expects from it. From this perspective, Expo 2015 could be the turning point, the opportunity to boost Milan's prestige and provide the perfect arena to reassert our claim to greatness."

The fashion pack descends four times a year and complains about the weather, the traffic. They shop, pillaging the stores on Via Montenapoleone, and then they leave, in a hurry to get to Paris. Even the Italians dislike Milan. Or rather, the Italians in particular dislike it. Any native of Rome or Florence or Bologna will tell you that all people do there is work work work, that it's gray, industrial, unwelcoming, without a soul. I've heard nicer things about Cleveland. Other cities have testimonials that brand them and broadcast their charm. What better promotion for New York as the big stage for self-made success than those catchy anthems sung by Frank Sinatra and Alicia Keys? How many generations of college students have moved to Paris, epicenter of love and seduction, after seeing films by Jean-Luc Godard and Bernardo Bertolucci? But no great talents had penned an ode to Milan that caught on outside Italy, and in the great big global picture, the city seemed to lack for an identity. Until now."

A.Since you've never visited Venice, this is the perfect opportunity to do just that. It is magical, and December/January is the off-season, when hotels are cheaper and the crowds are sparse; it is also convenient from Milan, by train or car.

In addition to Venice, you can also visit Padua, Vicenza and Verona, all in the Veneto region. Padua (Padova), about 32 miles from Venice, is a cultural center and home to one of the best universities in Italy; it is also known for its Giotto frescoes, and the Basilica di Sant'Antonio attracts droves of pilgrims. Vicenza (25 miles from Padua) is famous for its Renaissance-era buildings, many by the 16th-century architect Andrea Palladio.

Several years back, he brought fresh life to Zagliani, a venerable but musty manufacturer of crocodile bags, by applying techniques he perfected in his former life in medical school, where he studied skin reconstruction -- injecting the material with silicone and resin so that its stiffness gave way to a buttery softness. (The company is preparing to open its first stand-alone store, on Madison Avenue.) Orietti-Carella has applied the same philosophy to restoring his grand apartment in Palazzo Durini-Caproni di Taliedo, a spectacular 17th-century building smack in the middle of modern Milan but redolent of 400 years of history. ''I see myself as a person taking care of these beautiful rooms while bringing them forward -- making them the way they were, but with the sensibility of the future,'' he said."

She is survived by her husband Murray, her son Robert, her daughter Judith, her brother David, and by her cousins, nieces, and nephew.

Saul was drafted to the Bears in 1939 to help implement the T-Formation which he learned in college under Clark Shaughnessy. Saul played two seasons before going to work for his family and played on the 1940 championship team along with Sid Luckman that beat the Redskins 73-0.

Scattered about town or gathered in a few clusters, they wield enough international clout to make up for the time it takes to travel between them. Most ambitious is the Naples-based Lia Rumma's new temple to minimalist cool (1) at Via Stilicone, 19. One of the largest commercial galleries in Europe, it opened last May and has attracted a fashionable clientele. Its triple-height space, designed by CLS Architetti, easily accommodates anything the artists on its blue-chip roster (Marina Abramovic, Andreas Gursky, Anselm Kiefer, Ettore Spalleti, Vanessa Beecroft) can think up. Trust the Giò Marconi gallery (2), Via Alessandro Tadino, 15, for more cutting-edge excitement from artists like Nathalie Djurberg, Annette Kelm and Matthew Brannon, who get the run of two exhibition rooms and an underground lair. For a more historical view (for example, on Arte Povera artists), go upstairs to the Marconi Foundation, founded by the gallery patriarch Giorgio Marconi."

2010-10-17T00:00:00Z,"Long before Milledgeville, Ga., became the center of the Pittsburgh Steelers' off-season universe, the team had begun the move to a more run-based offense. Within days after the Steelers failed to make the playoffs as the defending Super Bowl champions last season, the team president Art Rooney II talked to Coach Mike Tomlin about reverting to a style that looked more like the Steelers teams of the 1970s and less like the pass-happy version that had emerged in recent years. Last season, the Steelers ran the ball 42 percent of the time and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger attempted 506 passes. Roethlisberger, right, returns from his four-game suspension against Cleveland on Sunday to a decidedly different team from the one he last led. Relying on a run-first attack (the Steelers have run 57.7 percent of the time in their first four games) and a suffocating defense, Pittsburgh was far more successful managing without him than almost anyone expected."

Suddenly, it's everywhere: in hotels from Milan (of course) to Tokyo; in shops, restaurants and airport lounges; and even at The New York Times, where cutting-edge Italian furniture can be found throughout the building. At a time in which design has become more international than ever -- provocateurs from the Netherlands, Japan and Brazil are just a few of the players who've shared the field in the last decade -- Italy's reach is global. And when you say ''Italy,'' you really mean ''Milan.'' It's the country's design capital, the place where every aspiring young designer heads in hopes of becoming a powerhouse. Italian design has many legendary, influential figures, like Alessandro Mendini and Michele De Lucchi, not to mention the firmament of departed greats like Joe Colombo, Marco Zanuso, Achille Castiglioni, Vico Magistretti and Ettore Sottsass. But among the most powerful designers in Milan today are three mega-successful people -- Antonio Citterio, Piero Lissoni and Patricia Urquiola, a Spanish protégée of both Castiglioni and Magistretti who set up shop in Milan in 2001."

2010-10-17T00:00:00Z,"'Wait,'' Maurizio Cattelan says in his low, conspiratorial, Italian-accented voice. ''I have something for you.'' It's a warm July evening, and I am walking along the Hudson with the art world's most famous prankster, so I feel a double twinge of apprehension and curiosity when he reaches into the cotton bag at his side. Out comes a strange object: a life-size orange hand from which all the fingers except the erect middle one have been broken off. Obscene, goofy and eye-catching, the one-fingered hand looks like a cross between a gag-store novelty and a sex toy. To anyone else, it might well be a joke. To Cattelan, it's something entirely serious: a prototype for his next sculpture, which is to say, his next test of the public's equanimity. Cattelan passes the hand to me, and we continue strolling, talking about his plans. This being New York, pedestrians and joggers studiously avoid glancing at us, two men contemplating a rude, inexplicable object. A couple of months later in Milan, if everything went as planned, there would be no ignoring Cattelan's hand -- or rather a giant marble version of it, standing on a travertine pedestal 20 feet tall, right in front of the Stock Exchange. Cattelan's colossal highway salute has a wry title, ''L.O.V.E.,'' but by midsummer the Milanese, reading about the proposal in the local media, had already begun referring to it simply as ''Dito Medio,'' the middle finger. Inevitably, it would be a gift to the artist's critics, who are apt to dismiss his works as one-liners. The hand's broken fingers, though, hint that things are more complicated. Imagine them back in place, and the gesture becomes a different kind of provocation: a vandalized Fascist salute. Whether spectators see a sly political allusion or simply an icon of good-natured irreverence, the one-fingered hand would be a grand, brazen, unforgettable gesture."

The new bicycle carryalls, crafted from wax canvas, oilskin leather and solid brass hardware designed to age nicely, are saddle bags you want. MARCUS CHANG"

2010-10-17T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA - The Mets and closer Francisco Rodriguez have adjourned their grievance hearing scheduled for Monday and are negotiating a settlement to their contract dispute, a team spokesman said. The Mets withheld about $3 million that was remaining on Rodriguez's contract after he sustained a season-ending thumb injury during an altercation with his children's grandfather Aug. 11 at Citi Field. Rodriguez was arrested and charged with assault, harassment and criminal contempt and has a hearing scheduled at Queens Criminal Court on Nov. 10. The Mets, contending that Rodriguez was unavailable to perform his duties because of an off-the-field incident for which he was arrested, placed him on the disqualified list and said they did not owe him the remainder of his salary for 2010. They also said they were unilaterally converting his contract to a non-guaranteed contract, which would essentially mean they could cut him anytime and not pay him the remainder of his salary. Rodriguez and the players association filed a grievance, and it was scheduled to be heard by the arbitrator Shyam Das. The New York Post reported that the sides were close to an agreement in which the Mets would not pay the remaining $3 million for time missed in 2010, but the contract would remain guaranteed, which is the association's primary concern. The tricky part for the Mets will be to find a way to avoid paying Rodriguez the $17.5 million option he has for 2012. The option vests if Rodriguez finishes 55 games in 2011. If Rodriguez is convicted of all charges, he could face up to two years in prison, which could solve the problem. Rodriguez, who is set to make $11.5 million next year, finished 46 games in 2010 before he was shut down after his final appearance Aug. 14. After that game, Rodriguez told the Mets' medical staff he injured his thumb during the altercation. He was found to have a torn ligament in his thumb that required surgery. In addition to the assault and harassment charges, Rodriguez was later charged with criminal harassment after prosecutors produced text messages he sent to the mother of his children after he was ordered by the court not to contact her or her father following the initial charges. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

The sprawl of new buildings - skyscrapers, hotels, apartment blocks - is almost unfathomable and seemingly endless. In front of me was the CCTV building, by Rem Koolhaas, with its twin cantilevered towers. A second building on the site caught fire during the New Year's celebration and burned, leaving a charred hulk, and the area around the complex is still under construction. Still, the dazzling architecture reminds you that you're looking at a new world. My eyes kept coming back to the Koolhaas building."

2010-10-18T13:08:58Z,"Fabrizio Ferri is at it again. The renowned fashion photographer, architect, clothing designer and musician has composed an opera, ""Anima,"" which will be performed on Tuesday in Naples at the Teatro di San Carlo (Europe's oldest opera house, dating from 1737). Ferri was initially contacted by Rosanna Purchia, the theater's newly appointed ""sovrintendente,"" to create evocative imagery for the coming season's performances. For the theater's first ever promotional campaign Ferri shot dance students from the Teatro's school in the volcanic surroundings of Mt. Vesuvius, above. Ferri, who had also been working for almost a decade writing, orchestrating and recording the score for a musical film, happened to play a selection of songs for Purchia, who convinced him to turn his film-to-be into an opera for the newly revived theater. ""Anima,"" which means ""soul,"" tells the story of North African immigrants who left their homelands behind for a better life in Europe. ""The music envelops the people like the sea,"" Ferri says, ""sometimes soothing, like a mother or father, and sometimes angry and dangerous."" An 80-person choir, a 50-person children's choir and an 80-piece orchestra will be joined by some gifted friends of Ferri: the trumpeter Chris Botti, who also contributed recordings for the original score; Andrea Griminelli, a world-famous flautist; and Gil Goldstein, an orchestrator. (A surprise appearance by Sting, a longtime friend, is also anticipated.) Ferri credits the creation of this extraordinary event to Purchia and to ""the power of this theater, in a moment of crisis, to have the guts and strength to create the necessary energy so artists come to Naples to play this music, to raise their eyelids, to look ahead."""

2010-10-18T12:08:43Z,"Thomas Jayne, the New York decorator, has always brought both a scholarly knowledge of design history and a quirky sense of the modern to his work, creating rooms that bridge the old and the new. And even though there is none of Jayne's own work in his new book, ""The Finest Rooms in America"" (The Monacelli Press), his sensibility is evident in his choice of what the book's subtitle calls ""fifty influential interiors from the 18th century to the present."" (Full disclosure: I am mentioned in the book's acknowledgments, along with a number of other magazine editors, but was not involved in the book.) Any conversation with Jayne on the subject of decorating invariably touches on his passion for great interiors of the past, and indeed, nearly half the rooms in this book are historic, although Jayne includes 20th-century interiors - like the living room of Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House and that of Charles and Ray Eames's house - in this category, along with 18th-century spaces like the Tea Room at Monticello or the Large Dining Room at Mount Vernon. But seeing his broad-ranging eye at work is part of the pleasure of reading Jayne's book. His selection of contemporary rooms won't please every decorator - particularly given the book's somewhat loaded title, an homage to the famous 1964 volume ""The Finest Rooms by America's Great Decorators,"" which included interiors by now-departed greats like Rose Cumming, Sister Parish and Billy Baldwin - but it is as catholic as his tastes. So you'll find the more-is-more drawing room of the jewelry designer Kenneth Jay Lane and Robert Couturier's classically inspired dining room sharing the book's pages with an elegantly spare living room by David Kleinberg and an edgy studio by Christopher Coleman. While many of the rooms are fairly grand in scale and furnishings, it is one of the smallest that that makes your heart beat faster: Albert Hadley's Manhattan intimate sitting room, an object lesson in understated chic, which Jayne rightly saves for last."

And no one fills that role better than Matthew Weiner, who created the show, oversees its production and would probably cater it if he had the time, and who is kind of like a walking Wikipedia of ''Mad Men'' (with a much higher rate of accuracy). On a visit to New York to cheer on Jon Hamm in Thursday's live episode of ''30 Rock,'' Mr. Weiner welcomed ArtsBeat to his hotel room to talk about the ''Mad Men'' season. Though he was tight-lipped about Sunday's finale - even on the Friday evening before it was broadcast - Mr. Weiner spoke at length about the ideas that were in play during Season 4, his vision for the show's characters and what the future might hold for the series."

A native of New Jersey, he was among the pioneers of the leveraged buyout industry having worked with both Forstmann Little & Co and Hicks Muse before retiring in 1989. After retirement, Mr. Vieser maintained an active presence in business by serving on the boards of some twenty organizations, including prominent firms such as Varian Medical, where he served as Chairman, Fisher Scientific, Dresser Industries, Control Data Corporation, Ceridian and Viasystems.

Throughout the series of corporate changes, he continued his rapid rise in leadership positions. Mr. Vieser served as Executive Vice President of StudebakerWorthington and ultimately as Chief Operating Officer. After McGraw-Edison acquired Studebaker-Worthington in 1979, he was appointed Executive Vice President and later President and Chief Operating Officer of McGraw-Edison.

While there, he served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of three Forstmann Little companies, Lear Siegler Corporation, FL Industries and Midland-Ross Corporation. He also served as Chairman of the National Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association, where he hosted numerous foreign trade missions at the request of the U.S. State Department and received honors from the states of New Jersey, Kentucky, Alabama and Mississippi. Mr. Vieser was an avid historian and voracious reader, with a profound love for music, art and travel. He was greatly involved in historical preservation and philanthropy.

Mr. Vieser was an avid golfer and a member of several golf clubs, including famed courses such as Baltusrol, Pine Valley, and Morris County in New Jersey and Ocean Forest and Sea Island in Georgia. Mr. Vieser was devoted to his family and his friends. His enormous spirit, sense of humor, kindness and love for life inspired all those who knew him. He believed life was something to be celebrated. His greatest joy was to be with his family and friends around the dinner table.

The three-game suspension of Shane Doan of Phoenix, handed down Monday, for his egregious sideswipe of Anaheim's Dan Sexton is an example of the N.H.L.'s policy in practice -- in particular its new rule against blindside hits to the head, for which this suspension is the stiffest so far:"

In an essay published over the weekend in the newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, Luca M. Possati writes: ""Few people know it, and he does everything to hide it. But it's true: Homer J. Simpson is Catholic."" As proof the essay cites a Jesuit priest's study of the 2005 ""Simpsons"" episode ""The Father, the Son and the Holy Guest Star,"" in which Bart attends a Catholic school and Homer tries out the practice of confession. The study concludes that ""The Simpsons"" is ""among the few TV programs for kids in which Christian faith, religion and questions about God are recurrent themes.""

David Frum took issue with this argument, citing Jonathan Rauch's recent piece on the changing composition of independent voters to argue that many of the ""independents"" tilting Republican this election cycle are really just right-wing voters who were disillusioned with the G.O.P., rather than the kind of middle-of-the-roaders that the party needs to rebuild a durable majority.

Stepping from the crisp tubular world of jet travel into the familiar thickness of tropical air, I descend the gangway into a place that once echoed with the thunder and stench of the Battle of Guadalcanal, a place first visited by American Museum of Natural History biologists nearly a century ago during an expedition that really did change the world, and a place still alive in a timeless blend of biological and cultural wonder that inspired my career as a biologist. I arrived here at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal nearly 15 years ago to study elusive forest birds. That was before I knew the details of the bloody battles that brought tens of thousands of American soldiers through this airstrip between 1942 and 1943, before I knew that my great-uncle preceded me here as a Marine, falling injured in the tawny hills."
2010-10-19T00:00:00Z,"When federal agents raided a home in central New Jersey on Wednesday, they discovered nothing short of a private armory, with pistols and rifles hidden throughout its 25-plus rooms. But they found something else - something, it would become clear later, that should give earthlings pause. First, the cache: Agents with the office of the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services - the key word being ''human'' - raided the home in tandem with dozens of arrests in New York, California and elsewhere in a sprawling Medicare fraud case. In indictments unsealed on Wednesday, prosecutors accused people described as Armenian-American gang members of stealing doctors' and patients' identities online and submitting bogus claims to Medicare, reaping about $35 million over at least four years. The New Jersey home belonged to one defendant, who lived there with an extended family that included wives and children, but the inspector general's office declined to give his name or its address on Friday, because the investigation was ongoing. All that is knowable about the man, then, is contained within the four edges of a photograph snapped by an agent on his cellphone and provided to The New York Times. Whether the agent found the cache to be run of the mill or was understandably agog at what was spread before him remains unknown. ''This is not your grandfather's fraud anymore,'' said a deputy inspector general, Gerald Roy."

In 1986, when he won seven Nascar races and finished third for the year in points, he seemed to be on the verge of stardom. But soon he would withdraw from racing, reportedly suffering from double pneumonia. The real culprit was AIDS, and on Aug. 13, 1989, Richmond died, a recluse at 34.

Offner was born in Brooklyn, NY on July 12, 1931, the son of the late Samuel and Helen (Wolowitz) Offner. He was raised in Brooklyn and attended Erasmus Hall High School and the Cooper Union before receiving a B.F.A. and an M.F.A. from Yale University. In 1960 he joined the faculty at Smith College, where he was appointed Andrew W. Mellon Professor of the Humanities in 1974. He has been a Visiting Artist at Brandeis, Yale, the Royal College of Art in London, and various colleges at Cambridge University in England. He was a Life Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge. Offner is best known as a sculptor in the academic tradition, working in many sculptural media, including carved wood, clay, plaster, and bronze, and his subjects included both animals and human figures. But he was also known for the great variety of his artistic outlets which included bookmaking, painting, graphic art and photography. Offner has received many honors during his long and distinguished career, including awards from the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the National Council on the Arts and Humanities, and gold medals from the National Sculpture Society, of which he is Past President, and the National Academy of Design, of which he was First Vice President. Offner was named Master Wildlife Artist for 2003 by the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum in Wausau, WI. Along with the exhibition, Offner was the focus of an impressive four-page spotlight on sculpture in the prestigious contemporary art magazine American Art Collector. His art work - both sculpture and graphic arts - is found in many private and public collections including the Hirshhorn Museum, the Brooklyn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Huntington Sculpture Garden, the Museum of Fine Arts in Springfield, MA, and Brookgreen Gardens in Pawleys Island, SC, which dedicated the Elliot and Rosemary Offner Sculpture Learning and Research Center in 2007. His many commissions include a monumental bronze and granite water sculpture in downtown Minneapolis, sculptures at Converse College (South Carolina), Smith College and the Darien (CT) Library, and a Holocaust Memorial in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. Offner is survived by his wife of 53 years, Rosemary (O'Connell) Offner, his children Helen Ong of Norwalk, CT, Daniel Offner of Santa Monica, CA, and Emily Hollidge of Eagan, MN, his brother Arnold Offner of Newton, MA, and nine grandchildren.

2010-10-20T00:00:00Z,"Nobody tell the Reverend Lovejoy, but Homer Simpson, the patriarch of the animated clan on Fox's ''The Simpsons,'' is Catholic -- at least, according to the official newspaper of the Vatican, Reuters reported. In an essay published over the weekend in the newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, Luca M. Possati writes: ''Few people know it, and he does everything to hide it. But it's true: Homer J. Simpson is Catholic.'' As proof the essay cites a Jesuit priest's study of the 2005 ''Simpsons'' episode ''The Father, the Son and the Holy Guest Star,'' in which Bart attends a Catholic school and Homer tries out the practice of confession. The study concludes that ''The Simpsons'' is ''among the few TV programs for kids in which Christian faith, religion and questions about God are recurrent themes.'' (Never mind that Homer has said he is a follower of ''that religion with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life,'' which he explains to mean Christianity.) Al Jean, an executive producer and show runner of ''The Simpsons,'' advised not to take the Osservatore essay as gospel. In an interview with EW.com, the Web site of Entertainment Weekly, Mr. Jean said the Simpsons family attends the First Church of Springfield, which is ''Presbylutheran,'' adding: ''We've pretty clearly shown that Homer is not Catholic. I really don't think he could go without eating meat on Fridays-for even an hour.''"

Not only his range of interests, but his energy. He photographed all things urban: accident scenes, fires, showgirls, drunks, families sleeping on fire escapes, murderers being arrested, and countless victims of misfortunes. But this Coney Island spectacular, taken on July 22, 1940, never fails to amaze. You have to ask: How could this be? Was it a special occasion? Weegee himself answers, again in ''Naked City'': ''And this is Coney Island on a quiet Sunday afternoon.'' Earlier photographs in the series are at nytimes.com/lens."

Mr. Sharon, who never regained consciousness after his stroke, remains hospitalized in Tel Aviv. In a video interview with the BBC, Mr. Braslavsky said, ''I choose to take Sharon because Sharon is kind of an open nerve in Israeli society which activated all the spectrum of emotional feelings to what being an Israeli is.''

2010-10-20T00:00:00Z,"OSAKA, Japan -- For years, promoters of sumo wrestling have been pushing for the sport's inclusion in the Olympic Games. To get there, the International Sumo Federation has thrown its weight behind a form of the game that would offend purists and surprise most everyone else: women's sumo. Sumo officials have long tried to get their sport, for years identified with giant men slapping each other in the ring, into the Summer Games. But when the International Olympic Committee declared in 1994 that single-sex sports could no longer qualify as candidates for the Games, that was enough to turn tradition on its head. Since then, sumo has been coming into its own internationally as an equal opportunity sport."

2010-10-20T00:00:00Z,"The Cutler Chase Is On Although Kyle Orton's current form suggests that the Broncos got the better of a big swap withthe Bears, JAY CUTLER's numbers have improved to the point where he is fourth in my adjusted quarterback ratings -- and has a traditional rating in the 90s. One problem: He's running for his life. While I generally prefer to focus on the empirical, I applied the''eyeball test'' while watching the Bears game on Sunday against Seattle, and every play looked like a game of playground football -- with Cutler playing the unlucky guy who is constantly running away from the bully who counted five Mississippis too fast. According to ProFootballReference.com, Cutler is being sacked on 14 percent of his drop-backs (sacks plus pass attempts)-- worst in the league. This would represent the highest sack rate in the N.F.L. since Andrew Walter was sacked on 14.3 percent of his drop-backs in 2006.Studies have shown that quarterbacks are partly responsible for their sacks -- they can't all be blamed on the offensive line. But in 2008, Cutler's last season in Denver, he was sacked on only 1.8 percent of his attempts --11 times (or, two more than hewas in one half against the Gi-ants) on 616 attempts. Before this season, his average sack rate was4.8 percent. Jumping from a career average of 4.8 percent to 14 percent represents a statistical anomaly that puts more of the on us -- in this case -- on the offensive line.LUIS DeLOUREIRO"

Mr. Brody, the Academy Award-winning star of ''The Pianist,'' has filed suit against the makers of ''Giallo,'' an Italian horror movie directed by Dario Argento, whose past films include ''Suspiria,'' The Hollywood Reporter said. In ''Giallo,'' which never received a theatrical release in the United States, Mr. Brody plays a detective who is helping a woman find her sister, who has been kidnapped by a serial killer. Mr. Brody said in a lawsuit filed Thursday in California that his deal for the film guaranteed he would be paid whether it was made or not. But after about a week of production, Mr. Brody said, its producers failed to pay $640,000 into an escrow account. Instead they signed the actor to a new agreement under which he would finish the film in exchange for the ''absolute right to withhold consent to the use of his likeness'' until he was fully paid, according to The Hollywood Reporter. After his work was completed, Mr. Brody said, he was never paid, and the producers ignored his demands."

Conceived by Boffo, an art and culture nonprofit group, and the architect/writer Spilios Gianakopoulos to promote visibility for designers and artists, the project - titled Building Fashion - consists of a series of five rotating installations in a space underneath the High Line (504 West 24th Street). The five participating fashion designers (Simon Spurr, Heather Huey, House of Waris, Richard Chai and Siki Im), none of whom has a freestanding store, were each given the opportunity to create a three-dimensional representation of his or her brand. Chai said he wanted to avoid ""the straightforward clothes-on-a-rack retail space"" in favor of creating ""an environment, a feeling, more of an emotional experience."" The ""cave,"" which is hand carved from high-density Styrofoam, also allows for irregular crevices and crannies to display merchandise. The store will carry  Chai's men's and women's collections and will be open to the public until Oct. 31 (noon to 6 p.m.), so head over there quickly before it ""melts."""

Many cooks have sworn off it, saying it's too heavy, too oily. And when it comes to the canned stuff, they're right. But mackerel can be mild and buttery, especially when very fresh. But, more importantly to me, it's the oiliness of mackerel that imparts its uniquely briny flavor. When cooked just so, mackerel is a fish you can love to serve as well as eat. And it's also relatively inexpensive.  Check out these links from the Monterey Bay Aquarium and The Guardian about mackerel sustainability. Recipes:"

Kind of like a ratatouille, to give you some sense of the intensity of flavor. But this set of vegetables went beyond the usual summery Mediterranean standbys - eggplant, zucchini, peppers - to include things like carrots (which also grow in the summer, of course), all deeply flavorful both because they'd been carefully purchased and impeccably cooked. I'm guessing that each element of the mixture had been prepared separately - how else to account for eggplant and carrots that were both optimal?"

But these days it's always a cause for celebration when a traveler can dispense with paper altogether (however gorgeously laminated it may be) and bring all his intelligence with him on his smartphone. Our friends at Luxe have rolled out a wide collection of their snappy directories for iPhone, covering 20 cities in total, among them Los Angeles, Florence, Venice and Beijing. Now the hotels listings come with pictures; there are GPS-enabled maps and automatic updates; and the whole guide can be searched and personalized with itineraries based on your favorites. What remains from the dead-tree versions, of course, are the cheekily concise summations of a smart selection of accommodations, restaurants, shops, clubs and culture - along with sundry raves, grievances and anecdotes. If there's one thing lacking, it's that we might like to read more of what the Luxe founder Grant Thatcher and his team have to say about the three bistros we're trying to decide between (seriously, Thatcher's hilarious). In the Luddite version of the guide, each gets only a sentence. But now that we're measuring in megabytes and not column inches, why not gas on a bit?"

Starting with the 1955 special election to complete his father's term, Mr. Dingell has won 28 times -- not 29, as the article and chart said. Therefore he is ''counting on his 29th victory'' -- not his 30th, as the headline said."

Those three are still undefeated, but this is the weekend when the Big 12 promises to shake itself out. Texas knocked Nebraska from the ranks of the unbeaten last week. Will the Cornhuskers be able to bounce back from that loss and do the same to Oklahoma State? Oklahoma travels to Missouri as the No. 1 team in the Bowl Championship Series standings, and the Tigers would love to prove their legitimacy by knocking off the Sooners. Speaking of legitimacy, Texas Christian does not seem as if it will get a legitimate chance at the national title, even if it keeps dominating opponents. The Horned Frogs face Air Force, which had been ranked until a loss last week. In the SEC, Louisiana State and Auburn are undefeated and in the top 10, but both seem to be searching for respect. Many think it is simply luck that has kept Les Miles's bunch undefeated, while Cam Newton has kept Auburn winning despite a woeful defense. In the Big Ten, Wisconsin is coming off a huge win over Ohio State. Now the Badgers travel to Iowa, where they hope the running back duo of John Clay and James White will continue their productivity. It's a weekend where many teams will find out where they stand, and so will our prognosticators. As always, if you agree or disagree with the picks, or merely find them laughable, feel free to drop in a comment."

2010-10-22T00:00:00Z,"5:52 p.m. | Updated If you take it from the ads running in swing districts around the country, every Democrat is a clone of President Obama, Representative Nancy Pelosi or Senator Harry Reid. But nationalizing the race has been harder for Democrats, since it seems few know who John Boehner, who, as House minority leader, is the party's top-ranking figure, is. So rather than nationalizing, some Democratic house candidates are state-izing, tying their Republican opponents to an attention-grabbing, Tea Party-backed Senate candidate. For example, a commercial for John Carney, the Democratic candidate for Delaware's at-large Congressional district, says his Republican opponent, Glen Urquhart ''and Christine O'Donnell want to shift the tax burden from the wealthy to the middle class'' while showing a photo of Mr. Urquhart clasping hands with the Republican Senate nominee."

Carol Wood, a spokeswoman for the university, said on Friday that Ted Genoways, the editor of VQR, had been invited to stay on as editor, and Mr. Genoways confirmed in an e-mail that ''Yes, I will be remaining on as editor.'' Staff members have not yet returned to work, Ms. Wood said. The nine-page audit, made public this week, was ordered after Mr. Morrissey's suicide, when some of his family and friends suggested that Mr. Genoways and stresses in the workplace contributed to his decision to kill himself. The audit said that there were ''no specific allegations of bullying or harassment prior to July 30th,'' the day Mr. Morrissey died, but also recommended that Mr. Genoways's ''responsiveness on administrative matters and his management style'' needed to be addressed."

Mr. Schulman, graduate of NYU Law School, handled Kimco's legal affairs for over 30 years, after his ""technical"" retirement, Mr. Schulman continued to represent Kimco on special matters. Mr. Schulman had a multi-faceted legal career spanning a broad spectrum, which included civil rights law, litigation and highly complex commercial transactions of various types. He was an adjunct professor of law at NYU. His life was distinguished by a relentless pursuit of excellence, fair dealing and integrity. Colleagues and associates respected him not only as a conscientious, dedicated and consummate professional, but also for the breadth of his wisdom, good humor and charm. He enjoyed mentoring junior lawyers and generously spent many hours to help them sharpen their skills. Those that worked with him will miss his keen intellect and perceptive insight. Mr. Schulman, a native of The Bronx, is survived by his wife, Marjorie by his daughters, Claudia and Janet; by his sons, David and Andrew; and by eight grandchildren.

Such financial moves are not uncommon in the waning days of a heated election season.

2010-10-23T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (HBO) INVICTUS (2009) In Clint Eastwood's rousing drama, inspired by a true story of revenge, reconciliation and athletic triumph, and based on John Carlin's book ''Playing the Enemy,'' Morgan Freeman (above right) portrays Nelson Mandela, newly elected as South Africa's first black president. Matt Damon (above left) is François Pienaar, the captain of the Springbok rugby team, a source of Afrikaner pride despised by most blacks -- and the vehicle, Mandela thinks, for bringing the country's races together, especially if the team wins the Rugby World Cup, which South Africa is to host. A. O. Scott, reviewing this film in The New York Times, wrote that Mr. Freeman played Mandela -- a role that earned him an Oscar nod for best actor -- ''with gravity, grace and a crucial spark of mischief,'' and that Mr. Damon, nominated for best supporting actor, matches him ''with crisp, disciplined understatement (and utter mastery of a devilishly tricky accent).'' He added: '' 'Invictus' has implications beyond its immediate time and place that are hard to miss. It's an exciting sports movie, an inspiring tale of prejudice overcome and, above all, a fascinating study of political leadership.'' 10:30 A.M.

2010-10-23T00:00:00Z,"The Federal Communications Commission tried Friday to step up the pressure on Cablevision and Fox's parent, the News Corporation, to reach a deal in their fee dispute. The agency demanded that the two sides ''provide evidence'' of good-faith negotiations, which are required by law in disputes over what is known as retransmission consent -- deals that allow cable systems to carry programming on broadcast channels. But the options for the F.C.C. remain limited, and the dispute shows no signs of resolution. For the first time since Saturday, when stations owned by the News Corporation -- including Fox's New York station, WNYW -- began being blacked out in homes serviced by Cablevision, the two sides held no negotiations Friday. Still, the F.C.C. request could be significant because if the commission determines that one side or the other is not acting in good faith, it may be able to impose a fine."

But that decision was quickly overturned and Ms. Lohan, after being freed on $300,000 bail, checked into the Betty Ford Center. Ms. Lohan, who faced up to 30 days in jail for the violation, was ordered to return to the court on Feb. 25.

2010-10-24T00:00:00Z,"It's a sign of how poorly liberals market themselves and their ideas that the word ''liberal'' is still in disrepute despite the election of the most genuinely liberal president that the political culture of this country will probably allow. ''Progressive'' is now the self-description of choice for liberals, though it's musty and evasive. The basic equation remains: virtually all Republican politicians call themselves conservative; few Democratic politicians call themselves liberal. Even retired Classic Coke liberals like Walter F. Mondale are skittish about their creed. ''I never signed up for any ideology,'' he writes in his memoirs. That would be fine (people are sick of labels) if clarity weren't such an obvious political advantage. Simple ideology routinely trounces nuanced pragmatism, just as emotion so often beats reason and the varsity fullback will most likely deck the captain of the debate team in a fistfight. For four decades, conservatives have used the word ''liberal'' as an epithet, while liberals have used ''conservative'' defensively (''I'm a little conservative on . . .''). And Fox fans range out of factual bounds (''death panels'') more than their NPR-listening counterparts in the liberal ''reality-based community'' (a term attributed to a Bush White House aide by the author Ron Suskind)."

(Or, say, shower curtain; many versions available for under $30.) In June, the 1979 design got its first overhaul in a decade, with Manhattan magnified, Staten Island shrunk, and a lighter taupe background and new gray outlines to make it more readable. But what if everybody designed his and her own maps? There are eight million subway systems in the city: we all ride the same trains, but we experience them differently. Inspired by map remixes posted on the Internet, Metropolitan decided to ask several prominent and interesting New Yorkers to reimagine the map in their own image, and a gallery of them has been published online.

2010-10-24T00:00:00Z,"Louise Bourgeois was reportedly a notorious hoarder. The artist, who died this year at the age of 98, accumulated all manner of tablecloths, napkins, clothing and bed linens - a lifetime's worth of material, really - which she began to cut up and reassemble into ''drawings'' in the mid-1990s. Her Collyer Brothers tendencies aside, Bourgeois no doubt found precarious comfort in the nest of this critical mass; she grew up surrounded by textiles in her parents' tapestry restoration workshop, and the act of sewing, she said, was her attempt to keep things together and make them whole. In this context, the more than 70 pieces in ''Louise Bourgeois: The Fabric Works,'' an exhibition that aptly christens Hauser & Wirth's new space on Savile Row in London, are as poignant as they are vibrant. But taken purely at face value, these pieces make one lament the fact that Bourgeois never moonlighted as a textile designer. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

In an effort to burnish its image, officials renamed the place Neukölln, but by the 1990s its reputation was so bad there was talk of going back to Rixdorf.

(The behavior at issue was the ingestion of peyote at a Native American religious ceremony.) The answer the court gave, with Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the majority, was that the religious believer must yield to the law of the state so long as that law was not passed with the intention of curtailing or regulating his or anyone else's religious practice. (This is exactly John Locke's view in his ""Letter Concerning Toleration."")"

But I'll confine myself to just one objection. To make his scenario work, Heilemann envisions Bloomberg winning states like New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, behind a combination of moderate Republicans, centrist Democrats and ""progressives disappointed with Obama."" In a vacuum, these might be plausible constituencies for Hizzoner - but not in an election where Sarah Palin is the Republican nominee! How many northeastern progressives (or Lincoln Chafee Republicans, for that matter) would contemplate casting a vote for a third-party candidate knowing that it might deliver the White House to the woman they fear and loathe above all others? Not many, I'd say. Nothing would be guaranteed to rally the Obama coalition quite like the specter of a Palin presidency: For months before the election, the drumbeat that ""a vote for Bloomberg is a vote for Palin"" would be well-nigh deafening, and I'm pretty sure that even a weakened Obama wouldn't have that much trouble holding serve in that scenario, relegating Bloomberg to exactly the kind of John Anderson-esque performance that would be his most likely fate in any case."

2010-10-26T13:00:56Z,"One of the tenets of sabermetric dogma is that there are no clutch players, only clutch events. Or if there are, the effect is so small as to be meaningless. Over the course of many seasons, you'll see that almost all of the players perform as well in clutch situations as in normal situations. A particularly rough stretch for a player is probably just a random bad stretch rather than an innate inability to perform under pressure. After all, could you really make it to the major leagues if you couldn't handle pressure?"

2010-10-26T12:05:44Z,"Cynics, or perhaps graphic designers, might argue that your average perfume is 99 percent packaging. Maybe more. ''A perfume is an image that you cannot see with your eyes,'' says Mathias Augustyniak, who, as one half of the design firm M/M (Paris), has worked on scent identities for Balenciaga and Narciso Rodriguez. When he and his partner, Michaël Amzalag, approached Ben Gorham of Byredo Parfums with an idea for a fragrance, they were not following their noses. They gave Gorham three inspirations: a block of solid ink they bought in Korea, a photograph of a Japanese friend who is a calligraphy master and an ''oversized absurd formula'' that Augustyniak drew with ink on a piece of handmade Korean paper. ''We spoke about ink with Ben, who is properly inked since he's covered with tattoos, which added a layer of resonance,'' Amzalag says. The result, M/MINK Eau de Parfum, is represented by a sort of smear campaign - artworks made from existing images, by the photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, that Amzalag and Augustyniak obscured with slicks of thick black ink. What the fragrance smells like is even more ambiguous. The artist Wolfgang Tillmans, a friend of the designers, described it to them as ''very manly,'' while a female friend declared that it reminded her of her grandmother, a comment that left Amzalag wondering if the friend had a manly grandmother. ''To me it feels like a roller coaster ride,'' he says, ''because it keeps changing once it is on your skin.''"
2010-10-26T12:03:11Z,"Two weeks ago, reams of the Dalton School's student newspaper, The Daltonian, were delivered in bulk to the private school's doors on the Upper East Side. But few, if any, of those copies ever made it into homerooms or many students' hands.

2010-10-26T10:30:21Z,"''Hella Jongerius - Misfit,'' the title of the Dutch designer's retrospective that opens Nov. 13 at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, refers not so much to her status in the design world but to the imperfect objects she has long championed. As the exhibition demonstrates, Jongerius has never had trouble finding sympathy for her ideas in the design industry, where companies like Vitra, Ikea and Maharam hired her to introduce beautiful inconsistencies into their sofas, vases and upholstery fabrics. As it turns out, the only people who ever took convincing were the craftspeople themselves. Royal Tichelaar Makkum's artisans cringed when they were told to fire her 1997 B-Set pottery (above) at too high a temperature, while Nymphenburg's worried that her 2004 Sketches plates looked half-finished. ''Craft has a tradition of trying to make perfect things,'' says Louise Schouwenberg, the show's curator. ''Hella told them to stop trying, because industry can do that better, whereas their appeal is more humane.'' Jongerius persisted, and these days, evidence of the hand of the maker seems completely natural. The misfits have become the mainstream."

2010-10-26T09:33:13Z,"Think - but not for too long - about the unusual place that Lea Thompson occupies in the iconography of American cinema, all because of the ""Back to the Future"" movies. As Lorraine (Baines) McFly (Tannen), she is a symbol of 1950s American wholesomeness and the mother-to-be of the time-traveling Marty McFly (played by Michael J. Fox). She is also the hot-to-trot teenager who spurns lovable George McFly (Crispin Glover) for the boy she doesn't realize is her own offspring. And that's not even counting the four different future incarnations of the role she plays in ""Back to the Future""s I and II, as well as her Old West ancestor, Maggie McFly in Part III."

Browne, a spokesman for Mr. Kelly. Mr. Browne insisted that the practice was lawful and intended for city business, but that Mr. Kelly may have erred by failing to report the foundation's payments on his financial disclosure forms by the city's Conflict of Interest Board.

They've designed a series of children's books that mashes up ""Mr. Men,"" the adorable, bodyless characters designed by Roger Hargreaves, with ""Mad Men,"" an AMC period drama you may have read a thing or two about. At their site (which we were pointed to by the good people at The Guardian's Media Monkey blog), you'll find covers for books like ""Mr. Draper"" and ""Little Miss Peggy,"" and a complete story called ""Mr. Sterling Gets Angry.""

He used his surrealist sensibility to transform the space, a former boxing gym, into a hipster fun house. To enter the store, visitors navigate Card's ''deconstructed forest,'' only to find themselves in the belly of a beast - a wooden tunnel that resembles a crudely assembled whale skeleton. The rest of the 6,000-square foot-space is divided into individual rooms, like a gallery hung with mannequins (above) and a library lined with asymmetrical shelving. ''Every room needed a distinct atmosphere, tone and temperature,'' Card says. ''The idea was to move from organic to industrial, from warm to cold. And always keep it open to change.'' The main attraction is the private club space, with its sound system by the legendary sound guru Mickey Boyle. For Card's sake, we hope the parties don't get too out of hand."

2010-10-27T00:00:00Z,"5:59 p.m. | Updated With tensions running high in the Kentucky Senate race, a volunteer for Rand Paul, the Republican candidate, assaulted a liberal activist in Lexington Monday night, stomping his foot on her neck and shoulder. The incident was captured by numerous video cameras and quickly went viral on the Internet. Lexington police received numerous calls reporting the volunteer's identity and by midday Tuesday had delivered a criminal summons to Tim Profitt, a Bourbon County volunteer for Mr. Paul. He was ordered to appear before a Fayette County District Court judge and police said he would be charged with assault. The campaign dismissed Mr. Profitt and barred him from ''any further association with our campaign.'' The episode occurred just before Mr. Paul was to debate his Democratic rival, Jack Conway. A liberal activist, Lauren Valle, 23, a volunteer for MoveOn.org, approached Mr. Paul -- some say she ''lunged'' at him -- to give him a mock award. At that point, some men wrestled her to the ground and one appeared to grind his foot into her shoulder and neck. Another admonished him, saying, ''No, no, no. Come on,'' at which point the man stopped."

The popularity of Pee-wee Herman, at the Groundlings and in his original stage show, led Mr. Reubens to portray him in hit movies like ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure,"" and on a Saturday morning television series, ""Pee-wee's Playhouse."" Two sex scandals could have cost Mr. Reubens his career, or made it unthinkable that he could plausibly portray the childlike Pee-wee -- instead, he successfully revived ""The Pee-wee Herman Show"" earlier this year in Los Angeles and is now about to open it on Broadway."

The reigning wisdom of theater producers these days is that if a play is ever going to grow up - that is, be taken seriously, receive lots of attention and, above all, make money - it can do so only on Broadway. I know that there are incontrovertible economic reasons for this theory. (Off-Broadway shows are highly unlikely ever to turn a profit.) And I suppose that as a New York theater lover, I should be grateful that the neon imprimatur of Broadway still holds a hypnotic glamor for people around the world."

2010-10-28T12:59:42Z,"When I tell stories about Iraq, the ones people react to are always the stories of violence. This is strange for me. As a public affairs officer in 2007 and 2008, I never saw combat, only its aftermath. I saw women and children wounded or dying in trauma centers. Ruins left by explosives in towns and cities across Anbar province. I saw surgeons who could do no more because the body they were trying to repair was too badly destroyed. I stood in formations as the bodies were taken away."

It's inexpensive (about $30), easy to use and even if it has no mechanical charisma - it looks like it was pieced together with parts from a Habitrail set - it's actually a carefully engineered tool that addresses some of the more obsessive issues concerning extraction, grind and temperature."

At the time, most of the funding for microloans came from foreign aid and philanthropy, and no lenders had yet turned profits. For some business-minded people, this was awful. It demonstrated that microfinance was an illegitimate kind of banking, worse ─ a form of charity. For those who were socially concerned, it was a saving grace. If microfinance ever became highly profitable, they feared, it would attract the wrong kind of people ─ profit-seekers ─ who would ultimately abandon the poor."

(By the way, our reviewers are not responsible for captions, and the reviewer in this case, David S.

2010-10-29T15:36:34Z,"Let's say this right now: It's hard to go undefeated in college football. After about the third or fourth week of the season, we all start to worry about what happens if all these teams go undefeated. Then teams start losing. That's the way it works. Suddenly, every week is like a playoff. Missouri and Michigan State are essentially playing playoff games on Saturday. Oregon as well. All those teams are on the road against ranked conference opponents with a lot to prove. A loss would knock any of them out of the national title conversation (some further out than others).  This is why I am not in favor of a playoff system. (Soapbox alert.) Not that I like the B.C.S., but I do not like the idea of a playoff."

The space fuses Red Hook grit with Levantine glam, incorporating a sweeping, 45-seat horseshoe-shaped bar under a warehouse-high ceiling that affords nice views of both the oversize wood oven in the open kitchen and the rotating exhibits on the walls.

""Hell, Yes!"" was unveiled on the museum's facade when its new building at 235 Bowery was opened in December 2007, and the sculpture became so closely associated with the institution that it was acquired by trustees and donated to the museum.

The museum said it would put ""Hell, Yes!"" in a new location, but did not yet know where or when this would take place."

As a brilliant young tax partner, Sherwin joined with Lou Lowenstein and a group of other lawyers from Hays, Sklar & Herzberg, to combine with Kramer, Nessen & Hochman in forming Kramer Lowenstein Nessen & Kamin in 1968. The new firm's vision was a first class group of lawyers that would compete with the major firms of the day. Forty-two years after its founding, the firm is one of the country's largest top-tier firms. Sherwin, who had proven himself an intellectual powerhouse at City College and Harvard Law School, crafted a career remarkable in both depth and variety. He established, built and led the firm's tax and individual client groups, and mentored generations of younger lawyers. Sherwin was a keen intellect, eager to analyze and debate contentious and complex issues. He published numerous papers, and was an active contributor to the tax, and trust and estates sections of the American Bar Association and the New York State Bar Association. A steadfast friend, loyal partner, and all-around bon vivant, Sherwin's legacy and spirit continue to guide our firm. We extend heartfelt sympathy to his children, grandchildren and extended family.

Long-tressed nymphs in Grecian drapery are decoratively arrayed around a circular band of stage trimmed with scallop-shell footlights. Films of maidens swimming and jellyfish making their inscrutable way through the ocean flash before us on a giant scrim.

''Hell, Yes!'' was unveiled on the museum's facade when its new building at 235 Bowery was opened in December 2007, and the sculpture became so closely associated with the institution that it was acquired by trustees and donated to the museum. Though nothing could replace it in our hearts, we'll try to keep an open mind about ''Rose II,'' a 28-foot-tall depiction of a flower that is expected to be fully installed by the end of November. The museum said it would put ''Hell, Yes!'' in a new location, but did not yet know where or when this would take place.

(HBO) AMELIA (2009) Hilary Swank, above, dons coveralls, leather jackets and an enormous smile to play Amelia Earhart, the American aviator who disappeared over the Pacific in 1937 while trying to become the first woman to circle the globe. Richard Gere is George Palmer Putnam, her quietly suffering husband to whom she wrote before their marriage: ''I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly. Please let us not interfere with the other's work or play.'' Manohla Dargis, reviewing this film by Mira Nair in The New York Times, wrote: ''An argument can be made that her death was a catastrophe -- a husband lost a wife and the world a feminist inspiration -- but 'Amelia' won't or can't rise to the tragic occasion. The filmmakers spend so much time turning her into a dopey romantic figure that they never give her the animating, vital will or even much of a personality that might explain how a Kansas tomboy turned Boston social worker took to the skies and then, through her deeds and words, encouraged other women to chart their own courses.'' 10:30 A.M.

New documents show that complaints into a chain of clinics he ran have been referred to the state health department, whose head is appointed by the governor. Throughout the close race against Alex Sink, his Democratic opponent, Mr. Scott has stressed that he was never charged with wrongdoing when the health care conglomerate he built, Columbia/HCA, was fined with $1.7 billion for defrauding government health programs in 1997."

The bill, which states that people who work on film productions are independent contractors (who are not allowed to bargain collectively under New Zealand law), was promised to Peter Jackson and the film studios behind two planned ''Hobbit'' movies, who recently agreed to keep the production in New Zealand. Mr. Jackson, the producer and director of ''The Hobbit,'' had clashed with actors' guilds in New Zealand and Australia, which had called on its members to boycott the project."

Because of this disconnect between living fame and later recognition, we have less of a record of these thinkers than we should. Our museums are filled with busts and paintings of long-forgotten wealth and beauty instead of the philosophers who have so influenced contemporary politics and society. My aim in this project has been the modest one of making sure that, for this era at least, there is some record of the philosophers."

Thus we throw money, confetti, booze, anything we can think of at the problem. When that fails, we drop a 1,000-pound ball on it. And Halloween in the city -- that otherwise harmless children's holiday with its adorably occult roots -- was weaned on New Year's. These sister holidays mark the beginning and the end of the holiday season in New York, with the former increasingly taking its cue from the latter. Streets are shut down for Halloween, costumes are purchased, it's impossible to get a cab and people seem legitimately concerned about their whereabouts weeks in advance."
2010-10-31T00:00:00Z,"Last fall I came across a copy of ''Native Trees of Canada, Bulletin No. 61, Fifth Edition,'' originally published in 1917 by the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources, Forestry Branch. In its flat, monochrome survey photographs I saw a simplified version of the Canadian landscape, like the one I understood as a child. Seeing the pictures reminded me of our capacity to colorize memories, some not even our own. I made a series of paintings from the book, and afterward, whenever I read a story, any mention of a tree stood out like an old friend. It's hard to find stories about Canada that do not include references to its trees. Here, from my bookshelf, are passages from some of my favorite Canadian authors on their leafy heritage. After passing the rapids, the river widened into another small lake, perfectly round in form, and having in its center a tiny green island, in the midst of which stood, like a shattered monument of bygone storms, one blasted, black ash tree. -- Susanna Moodie , ''Roughing It in the Bush ''"
2010-10-31T00:00:00Z,"Over the past few days, thousands of Democratic-leaning voters nationwide -- including the young people, minorities and unmarried women who were a crucial part of Barack Obama's 2008 coalition and whom the party is desperate to rouse again on Tuesday -- received a message in their mailboxes that effectively said: we're keeping an eye on you. The mailers are the handiwork of Hal Malchow, a political consultant who is acting on a theory that first intrigued him four years ago. Before the 2006 Michigan gubernatorial primary, three political scientists isolated a group of voters and mailed them copies of their voting histories, listing the elections in which they participated and those they missed. Included were their neighbors' voting histories, too, along with a warning: after the polls closed, everyone would get an updated set. After the primary, the academics examined the voter rolls and were startled by the potency of peer pressure as a motivational tool. The mailer was 10 times better at turning nonvoters into voters than the typical piece of pre-election mail whose effectiveness has ever been measured. Malchow, a 58-year-old former Mississippi securities lawyer who managed Al Gore's first Senate campaign and went on to start a direct-mail firm, read the academics' study and wanted to put the device to work. But he had trouble persuading his firm's clients -- which over the years have included the Democratic National Committee and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. -- to incorporate such a tactic into their get-out-the-vote programs. All feared a backlash from citizens who might regard the mailer as a threat from someone seeking their vote."

But one upstart is betting there's room for a new angle. The Know It Express, which debuts Friday, bypasses Manhattan and downtown Washington altogether, instead offering direct service from Washington's trendy U Street to Brooklyn's Atlantic Terminal, at the nexus of Fort Greene, Park Slope and Prospect Heights. The bus line, which one blog has already bestowed with the moniker ''hipster highway,''was founded by Shalonda Hunter, the founder of the Washington-based culture and travel Web site TheKnowIt, who hopes to tap into a market of young travelers looking to eschew Times Square and the National Mall for Brooklyn Flea and U Street's indie music venues."

2010-10-31T00:00:00Z,"RAGUS--Dale Smolen, of Weston, MA and Naples, FL, died Sunday, October 24, 2010, at Brigham & Women's Hospital after a long battle with lymphoma. She was 59. The daughter of Muriel and Henry Smolen, she was born on May 22, 1951, in Brooklyn, NY, and was raised in East Meadow, Long Island. She graduated Vassar College in 1972 and Cornell Law School in 1975. She practiced law as a trusts and estates and matrimonial attorney at the firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy in New York. Mrs. Ragus found that being a ""divorce"" lawyer was a daunting profession psychologically speaking. She had to deal with families where there was child abuse and those where a child was suffering from a fatal childhood illness. Getting calls from private detectives in the middle of the night when they had finally been able to track down a fleeing husband was not uncommon. She was part of the legal team that represented such famous people as Joan Kennedy and Pete Peterson. She was even involved in a case involving the disappearance of the wife, a case that was never solved. Her skills as a client advocate earned her the nick-name of the ""Little Barracuda"" of the matrimonial bar. She and her husband were actually married by legal contract. She eventually had her own private matrimonial practice until retiring to raise her daughter full time. She found that the most discouraging aspect of her profession was the persistent misrepresenting of facts by both attorneys and clients in court. She and her family moved to Weston, MA in 1990. Mrs. Ragus is survived by her mother Muriel Smolen, her brother David Smolen, her husband Jeremy Ragus and her daughter Jennifer Ragus. While fluent in four languages as a child, her early goal in life was to become a veterinarian out of her love for animals, a goal she abandoned due to innate fears of medical procedures - a cruel irony in light of her eventually having to endure years of painful cancer treatments. Described by her husband as ""The smartest women I ever met"", she was known for her lightening quick mind and her determination to live a life based on her terms. Just for the intellectual fun of it, she appeared on both of the television shows Jeopardy, where she was a two-time winner, and Wheel of Fortune, where she also won. She loved family, animals, cooking and old movies. She was a gourmet cook who approached any dinner with the goal of ""never cooking the same thing twice."" Above all, however, she valued intellectual honesty. The greatest joys in her life came from being with her family and having had the chance to raise her daughter, Jennifer at home on a full time basis. We will love and miss her always."

The first edition appeared in 1980, when Mrs. Vreeland was a special consultant to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she organized costume shows of Balenciaga and Yves Saint Laurent, among other legends. She worked on ''Allure'' with Christopher Hemphill, a process that took three years as she sought the elusive quality of personality in images of celebrities and models, in their gestures and sometimes violent expressions -- a special condition for pictures of Maria Callas -- and Mr. Hemphill did his best to oblige her. He recorded their conversations as they went along. In the original foreword, Mr. Hemphill wrote: ''I went through archives going back to the beginnings of the century.

2010-10-31T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (AMC) THE WALKING DEAD Robert Kirkman's zombie comic-book series comes to life in this new drama about a Southern sheriff's deputy (Andrew Lincoln) who wakes up from a coma after a shootout to find his town overrun by the undead -- and his wife (Sarah Wayne Callies) and son (Chandler Riggs) missing. Now he's a man looking for his family, and anyone who gets in his way is going to lose. Writing in The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley said, ''The television adaptation is surprisingly scary and remarkably good, a show that visually echoes the stylized comic-book aesthetic of the original and combines elegant suspense with gratifyingly crude and gruesome slasher-film gore.'' She added that the series is ''not for everyone, obviously, but it is well made: a hard-core zombie story that even vampire lovers can watch.'' 9 A.M.

Forty-two years after its founding, the firm is one of the country's largest top-tier firms. Sherwin, who had proven himself an intellectual powerhouse at City College and Harvard Law School, crafted a career remarkable in both depth and variety. He established, built and led the firm's tax and individual client groups, and mentored generations of younger lawyers. Sherwin was a keen intellect, eager to analyze and debate contentious and complex issues. He published numerous papers, and was an active contributor to the tax, and trust and estates sections of the American Bar Association and the New York State Bar Association.

Huddled in groups of two and three, a few dozen men and women in their 20s and 30s glanced at one another and at their smartphones, rereading the Twitter and Foursquare messages that directed them here, waiting for something to happen. Without fanfare a white van sailed up to the curb, and from it emerged a thin, 58-year-old man -- wearing a gray suit, a tiny red bow tie and white loafers -- who seemed as uncertain to meet his fans as they were excited to receive him. The gathering parted as he stepped onto the blacktop, picked up a basketball and made a few graceless attempts at hurling it at a hoop. ''Yeah, match that,'' he said snidely, to laughter."

A wonderful wife, sweet sister, loving daughter, cherished aunt and loyal friend to many, Ellen left an indelible mark on all who knew her during her too short life. Ellen enjoyed traveling the world in style. She was a caring and intuitive person who had the gift of instantly connecting with people. Many sought Ellen's advice and guidance, as she cared deeply about those around her, and they trusted her wisdom, insight, and skill in helping them find solutions to life's challenges. Ellen eagerly passed along her ""life lessons"" to those special young people in her life. Ellen earned a BBA in Finance from Emory University in 1984, and an MBA from Rider University in 1991. Ellen had a notable career, primarily as a senior sales and marketing executive at a number of large corporations where she led many award winning sales teams. Ellen was cremated and her remains were scattered in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Old Saybrook, CT on October 8, 2010. Survived by her loving husband Ralph Pignatelli, mother Tama, father Meyer, brother Peter, sister Sara, brother-in-law Elliot, niece Stephanie, and nephew Garrett, all of whom, along with extended family and many friends, mourn her loss. She brightened our lives - a woman whose goodness, generosity and sweetness will stay with all of us in our hearts and minds forever."

He was predeceased by his father, Walter Lispenard Suydam II, his mother, Elizabeth Suydam, his brother, Joseph Suydam, and his sister Elizabeth Von Briesen. Liz or Lizard, as he was affectionately known, graduated from the Stonybrook School, in Stonybrook, NY and Colgate University, Class of 1942.

Additionally, he was a lifelong member of the Holland, St. Nicholas and Bellport Historical Societies and the Suffolk County Marine Museum. Lastly, he was one of the last remaining ""bay men"" of the Great South Bay whether winning the Queen of the Bay Regatta in his Senta or duck hunting or scootering over a frozen bay. Lispenard was a gifted craftsman who could fix almost anything even though his meticulous approach often took longer than projected. But the finished product was done ""just right."" Probably, one of the happiest days of his life took place on July 4, 1962 when his three sons won each of their divisions in the Babylon Yacht Club Regatta. He simply levitated with joy! Lispenard is survived by his wife, Peggy Suydam, and his sons: Walter Lispenard Suydam III and his partner Elizabeth Parker, Bryce Card Suydam and his wife, Maryann and Peter Van Cortlandt Suydam and his partner, Sally Vittum. Additionally, he is survived by four grandchildren and six nieces and nephews. He will be missed for his outstanding sense of humor, integrity and loyalty.

2010-10-31T00:00:00Z,"THE NEWS Two packages containing explosive devices shipped from Yemen and bound for synagogues in Chicago were intercepted in Britain and Dubai, setting off a global terror alert Friday that included searching other planes. BEHIND THE NEWS The explosives were packed in toner cartridges for computer printers. Speaking at the White House late Friday afternoon, President Obama called the packages a ''credible terrorist threat against our country.'' Both contained PETN, according to Representative Jane Harman, a California Democrat; the same explosive was sewn into the underwear of a Nigerian man who tried to blow up a commercial airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day. American officials said they were tipped off to the explosives by the intelligence service in Saudi Arabia and emphasized that they were looking for additional explosives. The attempted terror attack emerged just four days before the 2010 midterm elections. For months, issues of national security and terrorism have taken a back seat to concerns about the sluggish economy.

Will Ferrell provides the voice of Megamind, an odd character who, as a baby, is sent away in a pod from his home planet just before it is destroyed. His nemesis, Metro Man (Brad Pitt), is dispatched at the same time, but while his pod lands into a home of privilege, Megamind's lands in a prison.

2010-11-01T15:42:14Z,"Several readers have objected to my assertion, in today's column, that Social Security was passed ""amid strong economic growth, rather than at the bottom of a recession."" After all, wasn't the program created during the Great Depression? So it was - but not, crucially, during F.D.R.'s first year in office, 1933, when the unemployment rate crested at 25 percent and economic growth was nowhere to be seen. Instead, the program was signed into law in August 1935, by which point the jobless rate was down to 20 percent and falling and the economy was growing at a brisk 8.9 percent clip, after growing by over 10 percent in 1934. By way of contrast, Barack Obama signed the health care bill in March of 2010, when unemployment had barely ticked down from its Great Recession high and G.D.P. growth was still anemic - as, indeed, it remains to this day. Of course it goes without saying that the overall economic situation was worse in the Depression. But Roosevelt could legitimately claim that the country had turned the corner (and, just as importantly, that the 1934 midterms had confirmed his political mandate) by the time he turned from economic policy to old-age entitlements. Obama, on the other hand, got his entitlement passed in the first 15 months of his administration - but one of the (many) reasons it's been a harder sell than Social Security, I suspect, is that the country is still waiting for real growth to return."

The Democrats would need to lose more than 45 seats in the House of Representatives, Jonathan Chait recently argued, citing one such academic model, for this election to count as a real referendum on Obama's leadership.

The final scene with them in Rita's old bathroom perfectly evoked their like-mindedness and their potential for the kind of real connection that Dexter has never experienced. Yet it also revealed his totalizing fear of actually having that kind of bond.Michael C. Hall's performance here was really powerful: his face seemed to quiver and his body to recoil without actually doing so, as Lumen outlined her biography -- her fear of marriage and of stifling convention, her need to breathe and experience thrills in life beyond having the right kind of china. Of course, this terror of dull, suburban normalcy is exactly what keeps Dexter so restive. He saw himself with frightening clarity in Lumen and is clearly afraid of what it might mean that the fates have delivered to him a woman who would not only accept his proclivities but also share them."

This month in Paris, for the inauguration of its new home division, Maison, Hermès is reintroducing these and other Frank pieces, including a straw-marquetry screen, a shagreen-covered vanity and the designer's X-base dining table. Robert Chavez, the president and C.E.O. of Hermès USA, sees ''a very exciting potential in the U.S.'' for the Jean-Michel Frank by Hermès collection, given the customer demand for furniture with the Hermès label. Previously, the company's furniture was limited to Pippa, a small collection by the architect Rena Dumas, who designed Hermès stores and who was married to Jean-Louis Dumas, the chairman of Hermès from 1978 to 2006. (Rena died in 2009, and Jean-Louis in May.) Their son, Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the company's artistic director and a sixth-generation member of the founding Hermès family, said starting Maison with historic designs was a deliberate strategy: ''We had to go backward to understand our roots and to go forward into the future.'' And in that future - April 2011, to be exact - the company will unveil further Maison collections, this time by a roster of (yet to be revealed) contemporary designers."

2010-11-01T00:00:00Z,"The Texans rushed for 257 yards in a 34-24 win over the Colts in the season opener, but those numbers don't convey how crazy the game was. The teams combined for 48 first downs, Peyton Manning threw 57 passes, and each team scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns. Indianapolis must overcome injuries to avoid a first-ever sweep by Houston. The Colts listed 12 players on their injury report, but the report does not include Dallas Clark and Bob Sanders (out for the season) or the suspended punter Pat McAfee. The surprising young stars who helped them through last year's injury crisis, like Pierre Garcon and Austin Collie, are banged up, so the Colts are counting on another batch of surprising young stars like Blair White to step in. Pick: Texans. MIKE TANIER"

Consider that with five full weeks remaining in the regular season, three of the top five teams in the Bowl Championship Series standings - No. 3 Texas Christian, No. 4 Boise State and No. 5 Utah - come from outside of college football's six power conferences. And consider some of the axis-shifting data that has defined this wacky season. Nevada is ranked higher in the B.C.S. than Florida. Mississippi State is ranked higher than Virginia Tech. Baylor is ranked higher than Michigan. Syracuse is ranked higher than Miami. All of those teams are ranked higher than Texas, which has fallen so far and so fast that no one really raised an eyebrow when the Longhorns lost to Baylor on Saturday night."

Now only in her second season and with her first runway show under her belt, Flinn is clearly looking at her own downtown style for inspiration. ""I'm always thinking of comfort - physical or psychological - it's about the great fabrics like stretch silk,"" she says. Translation: no-brainer, well-made pieces like slouchy jumpsuits, cropped crepe tees and ombre chiffon sash dresses. And, at prices ranging from $150 to $500 a girl could easily go all out. ""I never usually wear a complete Nomia look,"" the 27-year-old designer insists. ""I'll incorporate an American Apparel or Salvation Army T-shirt to my wool and mesh leggings and biker jacket with a pair of vintage roper boots from Capezio."" Her ""do try this at home"" advice: just add some pieces from Uniqlo (""their jeans have a great fit and don't stretch out""), Metropolis Apparel (43 Third Avenue) and Beacon's Closet (88 North 11th Street, Brooklyn)."

The researchers, from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital in Enugu, said the finding added evidence to the argument that malnutrition in the womb causes greater susceptibility to such problems in later life."

But James Franco, as is his wont, sees more in that retro two-girls-and-a-guy comedy than just double entendres and the loveless marriage of the Ropers, and has made it the subject of a new work to be presented at the New Frontier program of the Sundance Film Festival in January. On Monday the Sundance Institute announced the artists and works that will be featured in its 2011 New Frontier lineup, which is intended ''for festival audiences to explore the latest in cinematic innovation and transmedia storytelling,'' according to a news release. On the bill is ''Three's Company: The Drama,'' by Mr. Franco, the multitasking star of ''Howl'' and ''127 Hours,'' which is described as ''a multi-media examination of the classic 70s sitcom.'' The description provided by festival organizers continues: ''Television has undoubtedly shaped our world: our increased exposure to dramatic entertainment, the shapes of our houses, the shape of the time in our day. In this piece James Franco hopes to pull television from the box and view it from 'a slightly oblique perspective.'''"

Beloved father of Sara and Rebecca, husband of Abby, son of Ann and Richard, brother of Jimmy, cherished friend to so many, passed away on November 1, 2010 at the age of 47. He died of complications from a stem cell transplant for treatment of leukemia. An accomplished journalist, John was a regular contributor to publications, including The Washington Post, The New York Times and USA Today, as well as to National Public Radio, on homeland security and other public policy topics. He was working on a book about emergency preparedness, to be published in 2011, called, ""In Case Of Emergency, Read Book: Simple Steps To Prepare You and Your Family For Terrorism, Natural Disasters and Other 21st Century Crises."" John wanted it ""to serve as a guide and encouragement for citizens to begin the preparedness process."" He created the blog, ""In Case of Emergency, Read Blog A Citizen's Eye View of Public Preparedness"", whose readers included the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency according to The Washington Post. Many days (and nights) John would be in his home office or hospital room preparing his next ""Feed Blitz"". Born June 7, 1963 in Boston, MA, John was raised in New York City where he attended Collegiate School. Selected ""Head Boy"" by his classmates and faculty, he maintained a lifelong association with the school, from being a member of its Board of Trustees to leading the East Side against the West in 30 annual Thanksgiving Friday football games. John graduated from Harvard College, with a ""major"" in The Harvard Crimson, and relished being at his 25th Reunion this past spring with his adored girls. His avid interest in politics and, in particular, the role of government developed early, including working the floor of 1980 Democratic National Convention. John began his career as the Press Secretary for U.S. Congressman Philip Sharp before joining New York City's homeless housing development unit. After working in India, John attended Harvard Business School, graduating in 1991. He returned to New York City to manage Lifetime Television's news and public service campaigns, where he met and fell in love with Abby. They were married on May 9, 1998 and were blessed in 2000 with Sara and in 2002 with Rebecca. John covered so much ground while calling so little attention to himself, it is impossible to know all of his civic contributions big and small. He was a founding board member of the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance, an Adjunct Instructor in Emergency Medicine at the State University of New York College of Medicine, an active member of New York City's Citizen Emergency Response Team Program, and a Vice Chair of the Trauma and Family Violence Division of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. An All-City basketball player and gifted leader, John was always up for a pickup game even while on his honeymoon. Through his incomparable kindness, humility, wit, intelligence, integrity, grace, enthusiasm, determination, empathy and love he elevated all of us, individually and collectively. Friends may call Tuesday evening 7-9pm at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street. Services will be Wednesday, November 3, 10am at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street.

The partners, associates, counsel, and staff of the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP express profound sorrow at the death of our former partner, current Of Counsel, friend and colleague, Theodore C. Sorensen. Ted Sorensen was a national treasure who served our nation and our law firm with great distinction for nearly 60 years. Ted was a remarkable man of acute judgment who lived a life marked by grace, wit, wisdom, brilliance, integrity, devotion to the public good, always a servant of peace and justice. Ted's impact on our nation was enormous and has been well chronicled, especially his service to President Kennedy in times of grave crisis. Since joining our firm in 1966, Ted provided equally wise counsel to his clients and his partners at Paul, Weiss from sovereign nations and world leaders struggling to create sustainable democracies, to Fortune 100 companies seeking franchise-protecting advice, to Paul, Weiss lawyers seeking counsel about matters large and small, professional and personal, and to the poorest members of our society. At our firm, Ted was a cherished friend, teacher, and mentor. Ted's annual State of the Firm remarks are legendary, delivered in Ted's unique style, with his galloping prose, impeccable timing, alliterative charms and inimitable wit. Our firm, and our lives, are greatly diminished by his passing. He was truly one of a kind. We express our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife Gillian, daughter Juliet, sons Eric, Steve and Phil, seven grandchildren and to all other members of the Sorensen family."

Sure, we can see lots of colors during the day, but turn down the lights and, well, did you know that a large bucket of popcorn can accommodate an entire woman's shoe without tipping over? Yet for all these apparent flaws, the basic building blocks of human eyesight turn out to be practically perfect. Scientists have learned that the fundamental units of vision, the photoreceptor cells that carpet the retinal tissue of the eye and respond to light, are not just good or great or phabulous at their job. They are not merely exceptionally impressive by the standards of biology, with whatever slop and wiggle room the animate category implies. Photoreceptors operate at the outermost boundary allowed by the laws of physics, which means they are as good as they can be, period. Each one is designed to detect and respond to single photons of light -- the smallest possible packages in which light comes wrapped."

2010-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Football trounced baseball in the ratings on Sunday as NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' match-up between the New Orleans Saints and the Pittsburgh Steelers easily outperformed Game 4 of the World Series on Fox. Although final audience figures were not available on Monday, Nielsen's preliminary overnight estimates for the games show them leading the night over all. ''Sunday Night Football'' drew the highest ratings, although the audience for the broadcast was nowhere near last week's record-breaking game, which drew 25.6 million viewers. Fox's ratings for the San Francisco Giants' Game 4 victory over the Texas Rangers were up slightly, compared with Thursday's Game 2, which drew 14.1 million viewers when final ratings were released. Game 3 on Saturday attracted the lowest ratings for the series by a significant margin. The two networks led the night over all, with Fox's also getting a boost from an overrun of its afternoon football coverage well into the 7 o'clock hour. CBS placed third, garnering its most viewers at 7 with ''60 Minutes'' (10.7 million) followed by the reality shows ''The Amazing Race'' (9.2 million) and ''Undercover Boss'' (10.4 million) at 8 and 9. ABC was fourth. AMC said that the premiere of its new series ''The Walking Dead'' had been watched by 5.3 million, the largest audience for an original series on the channel. (By comparison, the season finale of the AMC drama ''Mad Men'' drew 2.44 million viewers.)"

2010-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Peyton Manning got Indianapolis' makeshift offense chugging like its old self Monday night. Manning, the four-time league most valuable player, threw two touchdown passes, then watched Mike Hart run for a career-high 84 yards and Jacob Tamme score his first career touch-down to help Indianapolis get past the visiting Houston Texans, 30-17.The victory allowed the Colts (5-2) to get even in the head-to-head series with Houston (4-3), and it gave the de-fending A.F.C. champion Colts sole possession of the South Division lead for the first time this season. And even though the Colts were missing the All-Pro tight end Dallas Clark, receiver Austin Collie and running back Joseph Addai with injuries, Manning and his teammates did not miss a beat. ''Whoever's in there has to find away to do the job,'' Manning said. ''It' snot always going to be pretty, but we've just got to keep grinding and making some plays.'' Manning was 26 of 45 for 268 yards. Hart ran with the same determination he used to become Michigan's career rushing leader and provided the Colts with a rare ground game. Tamme, Clark's replacement, caught six passes for 64 yards. But it was not just the new guys making plays -- or only the offense. Reggae Wayne caught a touchdown pass, Manning ran for a first down for the first time in nearly two years, and even became the lead blocker on a first-down catch-and-run by Pierre Garçon in the third quarter. The Colts' defense put consistent pressure on Houston quarterback Matt Schaub, too. Schaub struggled horribly in the first half and could not rally the Texan sin the second as defensive ends Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis applied pressure. The Colts had three sacks."

2010-11-03T15:47:57Z,"In my column this week I divulge the fact that I no longer soak dried beans before cooking them. If you're like me, and don't know that you want to make bean stew until, well, the moment you want to make bean stew, then that eight-hour prep just isn't in the cards.  That said, soaking beans overnight to soften them is really a great choice if you're the kind of person who knows what you will want for dinner tomorrow. The eight hours or so spent in the water drastically reduces the cooking time. This saves energy and gets your dinner on the table faster once you bring everything to a boil. So feel free to soak the beans for this recipe if you're so inclined. Just watch them carefully to see when they are done - probably in half the time it took me with unsoaked beans. Another issue that I briefly bring up in the column is refrigerating the beans while they soak. Years ago, I was taught that soaking beans might start to ferment if left in a very warm room overnight. Soaking in the fridge eliminates this concern. However, several readers have written to me saying that they never refrigerate their soaking beans and haven't had any problems. One friend, from the Caribbean, said she always soaks her beans outside on the porch overnight in 80-degree weather, and that those beans seem to cook up perfectly well. I'm curious to hear how you do it - do you soak at room temperature or in the fridge? What about quick soaking? Many readers use pressure cookers, so I'm asking, do you soak if you use a pressure cooker? Leave a comment to share your leguminous adventures."

The Preway is no longer in production, but you can still get free-standing fireplaces from Malm, a company out in Santa Rosa, Calif., that has been making them with great proportions and clean lines since the 1960s. (The one above is available from Design Within Reach.)

To me, that's a Malm fireplace. And I like that it's democratic, not precious. At its height of popularity, you were as likely to see one in a mobile home as you were in a groovy modernist manse. Those who dismiss these beauties as a bit of '70s nostalgia need to look again. I'm never happier than when I lie in bed and stare at my Preway, a glowing beacon of orange optimism in the corner of the room.  "

2010-11-03T00:00:00Z,"Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about the dismantling of the art installation ''Big Bambú: You Can't, You Don't, and You Won't Stop,'' on the roof of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, misstated the length of cord used to make the work. It was 70 miles -- not 7. The article also misstated the number of marriage proposals made in the bamboo thicket when the installation, which closed Sunday, was open. It was six, not three. Using information from the artists who created the work, Doug and Mike Starn, the article also referred incorrectly to its status when they ran out of cord. The rock climbers who were building it, and the artists, had to stop work but the installation was not closed for a week."

2010-11-03T00:00:00Z,"SOLOMON--John David. Beloved father of Sara and Rebecca, husband of Abby, son of Ann and Richard, brother of Jimmy, cherished friend to so many, passed away on November 1, 2010 at the age of 47. He died of complications from a stem cell transplant for treatment of leukemia. An accomplished journalist, John was a regular contributor to publications, including The Washington Post, The New York Times and USA Today, as well as to National Public Radio, on homeland security and other public policy topics. He was working on a book about emergency preparedness, to be published in 2011, called, ""In Case Of Emergency, Read Book: Simple Steps To Prepare You and Your Family For Terrorism, Natural Disasters and Other 21st Century Crises."" John wanted it ""to serve as a guide and encouragement for citizens to begin the preparedness process."" He created the blog, ""In Case of Emergency, Read Blog A Citizen's Eye View of Public Preparedness"", whose readers included the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency according to The Washington Post. Many days (and nights) John would be in his home office or hospital room preparing his next ""Feed Blitz"". Born June 7, 1963 in Boston, MA, John was raised in New York City where he attended Collegiate School. Selected ""Head Boy"" by his classmates and faculty, he maintained a lifelong association with the school, from being a member of its Board of Trustees to leading the East Side against the West in 30 annual Thanksgiving Friday football games. John graduated from Harvard College, with a ""major"" in The Harvard Crimson, and relished being at his 25th Reunion this past spring with his adored girls. His avid interest in politics and, in particular, the role of government developed early, including working the floor of the 1980 Democratic National Convention. John began his career as the Press Secretary for U.S. Congressman Philip Sharp before joining New York City's homeless housing development unit. After working in India, John attended Harvard Business School, graduating in 1991. He returned to New York City to manage Lifetime Television's news and public service campaigns, where he met and fell in love with Abby. They were married on May 9, 1998 and were blessed in 2000 with Sara and in 2002 with Rebecca. John covered so much ground while calling so little attention to himself, it is impossible to know all of his civic contributions big and small. He was a founding board member of the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance, an Adjunct Instructor in Emergency Medicine at the State University of New York College of Medicine, an active member of New York City's Citizen Emergency Response Team Program, and a Vice Chair of the Trauma and Family Violence Division of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. An All-City basketball player and gifted leader, John was always up for a pickup game even while on his honeymoon. Through his incomparable kindness, humility, wit, intelligence, integrity, grace, enthusiasm, determination, empathy and love he elevated all of us, individually and collectively. Friends may call Tuesday evening 7-9pm at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street. Services will be Wednesday, November 3, 10am at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. In lieu of flowers, donations in John's memory may be sent to The New York Community Trust for the John D.

Rarely do postseasons play out according to the expected narrative, but if anything, the pitching of this postseason exceeded expectations. The dominance did not show up as much in the overall postseason earned run average as it did in the individual performances. Tim Lincecum's 10-strikeout dominance of the Rangers on Monday night to close out the World Series provided a fitting bookend to his 14-strikeout victory in Game 1 of the division series, and Roy Halladay's no-hit performance to open the division series."

As the United States approached the central crisis in its history, there was no reason to expect great eloquence from the man whose election had precipitated that conflict. Abraham Lincoln was often described as an uncouth barbarian, and had received the least education of any presidential nominee in American history, save Andrew Jackson. Yet there he was in the fall of 1860, standing before the American people, the embodiment of their hopes and fears. In this politically charged atmosphere, the words that flowed from his pen, and his equally expressive silences, did a great deal to define the conflict coming into view. This occasional feature in the Disunion series will probe Lincoln's language, looking at his speeches and public pronouncements during the long transition between his election eve on Nov. 5, 1860, and his First Inaugural Address on March 4, 1861."

2010-11-04T18:03:00Z,"In reading the nearly 700 reader responses to my Oct. 17 essay for The Stone, (""Morals Without God?"") I notice how many readers are relieved to see that there are shades of gray when it comes to the question whether morality requires God. I believe that such a discussion needs to revolve around both the distant past, in which religion likely played little or no role if we go back far enough, and modern times, in which it is hard to disentangle morality and religion. The latter point seemed obvious to me, yet proved controversial. Even though 90 percent of my text questions the religious origins of human morality, and wonders if we need a God to be good, it is the other 10 percent - in which I tentatively assign a role to religion - that drew most ire. Atheists, it seems (at least those who responded here) don't like any less than 100 percent agreement with their position.To have a productive debate, religion needs to recognize the power of the scientific method and the truths it has revealed, but its opponents need to recognize that one cannot simply dismiss a social phenomenon found in every major society. If humans are inherently religious, or at least show rituals related to the supernatural, there is a big question to be answered. The issue is not whether or not God exists - which I find to be a monumentally uninteresting question defined, as it is, by the narrow parameters of monotheism - but why humans universally feel the need for supernatural entities. Is this just to stay socially connected or does it also underpin morality? And if so, what will happen to morality in its absence?"

To create ''[2,3]'' - which is being introduced this weekend by Printed Matter at the NY Art Book Fair - she spent months teaching herself how to construct complex geometric shapes from strips of paper, then several more creating templates and instructional videos so that the printer could reproduce them. Among the pieces are ''Cubearc'' (above), a delicate Möbius-like curl and ''Ziggurat'': 10 nested tiers that telescope out to 18 inches high. ''I tried things that someone who had experience probably would have shied away from,'' says Auerbach, who insists that her goal ''wasn't to make the most complicated thing possible.

2010-11-04T00:00:00Z,"LOEB--Elizabeth. The Loeb family marks with profound sadness the passing of Elizabeth ""Peggy"" Loeb, 84 wife, mother, grandmother, teacher, Pan American Stewardess, gourmet cook, animal lover, and jewelry designer extraordinaire. Born in Bad Kissingen, Germany as trouble was mounting in that country, Peggy spent much of her school years in Vevey, Switzerland, and later studied at Charles University in Prague. Towards the end of WWII, she nursed German soldiers, then fled Czechoslovakia to avoid the advancing Russian army. Walking for three months at night and often hiding in foxholes to avoid rapacious soldiers, she made her way to the Bavarian town of Freising, where an uncle was a city elder. When the US Army arrived, Peggy--who spoke perfect English--was persuaded by her uncle to surrender the town. After the war, Peggy's command of English also landed her a secretarial position with the British Counsel General in Frankfurt, and later a position with Pan American Airlines. Falling in with a lively international crowd in post-war Frankfurt, she met Marshall Loeb, an American correspondent with the United Press. Their unlikely romance startled both families, and they were married in August, 1954 in the Frankfurt City Hall. A planned year-long honeymoon around the world was cut a bit short by the arrival of Michael Rolf, who was later joined by a sister, Margaret Karen. Peggy devoted herself to her family and to guiding the flourishing journalistic career of her husband, who became the Managing Editor of Money and Fortune Magazines, a radio and television commentator, and the author of more than a dozen books. The family traveled widely in support of Marshall's work, and settled in Scarsdale, New York, where Peggy held court in her spacious kitchen and at the Scarsdale pool, impressing friends with her incisive take on events of the day, her candid appraisal of people, her sage advice, puckish humor, and cultivated tastes. A memorial service will be held Sunday, November 14, at 5 pm at The Core Club, 66 East 55th Street, in New York City. In lieu of flowers, please send donations in her memory to the Humane Society of New York (212) 752-4842."

The amendment, added in the House of Representatives with no debate, repeals a law that prohibited financial institutions from paying interest on business checking accounts, which are known as demand deposit accounts. The prohibition had been part of the Glass-Steagall Act and was in force for nearly 70 years. The amendment was sponsored by Representative Scott Murphy, a Democrat from New York who is facing a tough battle to save his seat in today's election.* ''I started my first business when I was 24,'' said Mr. Murphy in a phone interview between campaign appearances on Friday. ''And I went around to different banks and talked to them about getting set up, and I was amazed that I was paying them to have an account, and they weren't paying me any interest. It's just one of those antiquated rules that's left on the books but is hurting our small businesses, so we got rid of it.''"

Needless to say, it did not take long for Funkmaster Flex to bring up Mr. West's appearance at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when he interrupted an acceptance speech by Taylor Swift to complain that her award for best video by a female artist should have gone to Beyonce. And instead of adopting the apologetic stance he had previously taken when addressing the subject, Mr. West gave a more complicated and revealing response."

This game provides a chance for each to showcase why they should be considered among the country's elite. Another team that is hoping for some national recognition is Baylor, which beat Texas last week and is hoping to go into Oklahoma State and upend the Cowboys. Nick Saban is sure to get a, ahem, loud reception when Alabama takes the field against Louisiana State. Perhaps Les Miles can draw on some of his magic and help the Tigers beat back the Tide.

But they are manifestations of a cultural shift that happened after the so-called Judgment of Paris in 1976, in which a number of California wines were deemed superior to their French counterparts. On Nov. 20, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art will open ''How Wine Became Modern: Design and Wine 1976 to Now.'' Organized by Henry Urbach, the museum's curator of architecture and design, the exhibition - which is designed by the architects Diller Scofidio and Renfro - explores the evolution of wine's visual and material culture. It includes a gallery devoted to the subject of terroir, a commissioned wall work by Peter Wegner that charts more than 200 paint colors with names like Cabernet and Crush, and a look at, among other issues, the effect of architecture on wine tourism. The museum knows the subject well, having organized the first architectural competition for the design of a winery, in 1985. The winner was the architect-artist team of Michael Graves and Edward Schmidt, resulting in Clos Pegase, the prototype of the modern designer winery."

The Philadelphia Museum of Art is celebrating the 90-year-old company with an exhibition, ''Alessi: Ethical and Radical,'' which opens Nov. 21. Central to Alessi's success is its creative mastermind, Alberto Alessi, a grandson of the founder, who has run the company since the 1970s. ''He's absolutely unique in the amount of time and money that he has spent on design,'' said Kathryn Hiesinger, the exhibition's curator. Included in the show are planned reissues of designs from the 1920s, '30s and '40s, a time that Alberto Alessi describes as ''predesign,'' before the rise of glossy ''designer'' products - which is ironic coming from the man who helped invent the category.

Halloween insiders in that neighborhood know that the mayor - who has declared war on junk food - gives out the biggest and most caloric treats: full-size candy bars. This year Mr. Bloomberg did not disappoint: Our source reports that the mayor - actually, it may not have been the mayor; it was a person dressed up as Mickey Mouse - answered the door at the five-story Beaux Arts town house and dispensed big Snickers and Twix bars out of a plastic pumpkin as Mr. Bloomberg's security team looked on. The source, who admits actually visiting Mr. Bloomberg's home twice Sunday, once about 5 p.m., then again at 7:30, said that on his second visit, it was dark, and the candy had all run out. But the Mickey character, in a high-pitched voice, instructed the trick-or-treaters to wait, and then another mysterious figure appeared, with more rich goodies.

She started her career as an illustrator, designing the famed cover of the first issue of Ms. Magazine, and ended it as a world-renowned artist.

She loved color; she loved the sun; she loved the ocean; she loved quiet and she also loved any excess of the senses. Her curiosity took her around the world and she brought the world into her home. Miriam was a wonderful hostess. She was a committed supporter of the arts, of creativity in all forms, and of spiritual pursuits. She faced illness with courage and grace.

(HBO) AVATAR (2009) This ''trippy joy ride about the end of life -- our moviegoing life included,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, took several decades of dreaming, four years of making and a production budget of $230 million from the director James Cameron. It also snared nine Oscar nominations but failed to earn both the best director and best picture awards. (Those went to Mr. Cameron's ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow for ''The Hurt Locker.'') Sam Worthington plays a paraplegic former Marine who is transported from a wheelchair into a 10-foot, blue-skinned, part-alien and part-human body, above right, the better to infiltrate, on behalf of a greedy corporation, a distant moon that harbors a valuable substance called unobtainium. Alas, he falls in love, with both this lush, brilliantly colored dreamscape and one of its slinky inhabitants (Zoë Saldana), above left. ''Created to conquer hearts, minds, history books and box-office records, the movie -- one of the most expensive in history, the jungle drums thump -- is glorious and goofy and blissfully deranged,'' Ms. Dargis said. ''If the story of a paradise found and potentially lost feels resonant, it's because 'Avatar' is as much about our Earth as the universe that Mr. Cameron has invented. But the movie's truer meaning is in the audacity of its filmmaking.'' 10:30 A.M.

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"HELLER--Diana Schubart Was a financial industry pioneer, one of the first to make her way in the largely male world of brokerage institutions. Her career as a portfolio manager began in the early 1970s, after a divorce in 1973, and continued into the 1990s. Earlier, she had had a career in modern dance. Her financial career began when she went to work for Kuhn Loeb & Co., after qualifying as a broker. When Kuhn Loeb merged with Lehman Brothers in 1977, she continued as the only female executive with the firm until, in 1981, shortly before the firm sold itself to the newly merged Shearsonmerican Express, she was recruited by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. as a vice president. There she managed the investments of a number of high-profile accounts, among them Georgia O'Keeffe's, the wife of Mrs. Heller's great-uncle Alfred Sieglitz, the renowned photographer and art pioneer. She retired in 1991. Born in 1920 in New York City to Dorothy Obermeyer Schubart, an artist and interior decorator and close friend of O'Keeffe's, and William Howard Schubart, Diana Heller attended Greenwich Academy (Class of 1938) and Sarah Lawrence (1942) where she studied dance with Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham. After graduating, she served in the WAVES during World War II and then worked as a dance instructor at the Donald Sawyer Dance Studio in New York. She continued her own studies in ballet and tap, appearing in several Broadway shows including ""The Merry Widow."" ""I danced so much,"" she said, ""I'd have to walk down the stairs backward to keep my calf muscles from stiffening."" Mrs. Heller's father was a world-renowned financial policy expert, first at the old Bank of Manhattan and, later, as a senior partner at Lazard Freres & Co. He was a participant in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944. Her only sibling, William Howard Schubart Jr., died in the Pacific Theater just before the end of World War II. She is survived by two sons from her 1956 marriage to Dr. Sidney Heller, Mark Heller, an executive coach and business strategist, and Jeffrey Heller, an executive director at Cushman Wakefield, and his wife Barbra Heller, a nutritionist. She is also survived by a nephew, William Howard Schubart III of Hinesburg, Vermont, and two grand-nephews, Peter Boynton Schubart, also of Vermont and William Howard Schubart IV of New York City."

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"If you have your low-budget heart set on high-end islands like St. Bart's or St. Martin or Turks and Caicos this winter, with enough research and flexibility you may be able to pull it off. But the real way to keep costs down is to head to the lower-cost islands that actively compete for travelers with light wallets. The first rule is that the lower your budget, the greater the proportion that will be devoted to airfare. That's why the Bahamas is a good place to start looking this winter, when the islands' Ministry of Tourism offers airfare promotions. Under the Free Companion Airfare and Instant Air Credit, travelers who book a four-night stay at certain hotels (some under $150 a night) will get either a companion ticket free or a $300 ''instant air credit.'' Travel must be booked by Dec. 1. Even if you don't stay in a hotel covered by the deal, the Bahamas is one of the cheaper destinations to fly this winter, at least from New York. On the other hand, the relative lack of all-inclusive resorts means that it's trickier to keep costs down for meals and other activities once you're there."

His wife didn't seem to hear him. Suddenly, her whole body began to jerk. Although he had never seen a seizure, the young man knew immediately that this was one. After a long and terrifying minute the jerking stopped and his wife lay quiet with her eyes closed, as if she were asleep. When he couldn't wake her, he picked up the phone and dialed 911. In the emergency room, the young woman was sleepy and confused. She didn't remember the seizure. All she knew was that she felt bad earlier that day. Her shoulders ached and she had these strange shooting pains that ran up her neck, into her skull. She had a wicked headache too. Although she had this headache for months, it was much worse that day. At home she took a long hot bath and went to bed. She woke up in the ambulance."

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"Cynics, or perhaps graphic designers, might argue that your average perfume is 99 percent packaging. Maybe more. ''A perfume is an image that you cannot see with your eyes,'' says Mathias Augustyniak, who, as one half of the design firm M/M (Paris), has worked on scent identities for Balenciaga and Narciso Rodriguez. When he and his partner, Michaël Amzalag, approached Ben Gorham of Byredo Parfums with an idea for a fragrance, they were not following their noses. They gave Gorham three inspirations: a block of solid ink they bought in Korea, a photograph of a Japanese friend who is a calligraphy master and an ''oversized absurd formula'' that Augustyniak drew with ink on a piece of handmade Korean paper. ''We spoke about ink with Ben, who is properly inked since he's covered with tattoos, which added a layer of resonance,'' Amzalag says. The result, M/MINK Eau de Parfum, is represented by a sort of smear campaign -- artworks made from existing images, by the photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, that Amzalag and Augustyniak obscured with slicks of thick black ink. What the fragrance smells like is even more ambiguous. The artist Wolfgang Tillmans, a friend of the designers, described it to them as ''very manly,'' while a female friend declared that it reminded her of her grandmother, a comment that left Amzalag wondering if the friend had a manly grandmother. ''To me it feels like a roller coaster ride,'' he says, ''because it keeps changing once it is on your skin.'' ALIX BROWNE"

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"The artist Tauba Auerbach deals with perception and illusion, finding moments of ambiguity between two dimensions and three. (Think of her trompe l'oeil ''folded'' canvases, at this year's Whitney Biennial.) Which is why, presumably, she fell so hard for pop-up books. ''When a page closes, you see an object kind of smush, and in that moment, it's in a liminal state not unlike the Fold paintings,'' she says. Auerbach began collecting classic pop-ups like ''Alphabeta Concertina'' and ''Andy Warhol's Index (Book)'' last year, and also began the process of making her own. To create ''[2,3]'' -- which is being introduced this weekend by Printed Matter at the NY Art Book Fair -- she spent months teaching herself how to construct complex geometric shapes from strips of paper, then several more creating templates and instructional videos so that the printer could reproduce them. Among the pieces are ''Cubearc'' (above), a delicate Möbius-like curl and ''Ziggurat'': 10 nested tiers that telescope out to 18 inches high. ''I tried things that someone who had experience probably would have shied away from,'' says Auerbach, who insists that her goal ''wasn't to make the most complicated thing possible. It was just to make something beautiful and uncanny happen.'' MONICA KHEMSUROV"

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"THE ART OF LIVING Yvonne Force Villareal, a co-founder of Art Production Fund, the nonprofit public art organization, knows firsthand the way art can fill a void. ''I didn't have a TV until third grade,'' she says, ''so I was an obsessive drawer, creating elaborate soap operas about my life, page after page, daily.'' Fast-forward to the loft she shares with her husband, the artist Leo Villareal; their young son, Cuatro; and a fluffy black Pomeranian named Puff Baby. (The couple's second child is due this month.) Their airy West Village space is populated with pieces by artists she ''knows and loves,'' like John Currin, Alex Katz, Lisa Yuskavage, Aaron Young, Nate Lowman, Rachel Feinstein and, of course, Villareal. The art shares billing with bold vintage furnishings. ''I'm a freak for sexy, sleazy, tacky, beautfiul design from the '70s,'' she says. She attributes her love of big sectionals by Pierre Cardin, blocky tables by Paul Evans and massive John Chamberlain parachute couches to her eccentric upbringing. ''I lived in a 24-foot trailer with a few flimsy built-ins, and then moved to a huge Victorian house where my mom had all uncomfortable antiques, and no couch.''"

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"AFTER logging 460 training miles since June, I found myself staring at my computer screen, my thumb on the track pad hovering over the deregistration button for the 2010 New York City Marathon. I was seriously considering dropping out. I had just learned that I had been placed in the last wave of the marathon's 40,000 registered runners, which meant I'd be running on the lower deck of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge (not the upper deck, as I had dreamed of running) and at the very back of the pack (less of a surprise, but still upsetting)."
2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"In Switzerland, a sans-serif, politely modern, supersleek, always tidy, adamantly neutral country, where everything uniformly ticktocks, lock-step, you might begin to think each new building and interior were designed by the same architect. Switzerland even has a typeface -- Helvetica -- named after it (the country is also known as Confoederatio Helvetica), in which no letter steps out of line. But an eBay purchase led me to Zurich, where I found the serif, the dingbat and the curvy character, all in one: Arthur Rooks. I bought a primitive spindle-back farm chair for peanuts, which Rooks, the invisible seller at the other end of my eBay transaction, claimed was hand-carved, 150 years old and straight from the ferme in Belfort, France, about an hour and a half across the border from Zurich. I PayPal-ed it, pronto, and Rooks shipped it to me meticulously cushioned and perfectly crated, in a matter of days, as if I'd just bought slippers at Zappos. It was exactly as described, and got me wondering, Who is this guy? With that stout, German-sounding name, I pictured a hardy hiker in lederhosen, surrounded by Alpine shipping-room elves. I discovered that Rooks also runs a home furnishings Web site, quintessentia.com, where you will find a treasure trove of seriously good stuff. He sells Bauhaus, Arts & Crafts, early Swiss Modernist and much better midcentury modern than you can find in New York."

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"When Prince George received his mother, Queen Mary, for lunch, Constance Spry, who did his flower arrangements, deployed carnations, her bête noir, in conventional containers, which she loathed. But when the queen wasn't around, the ''flowers'' were more likely to be kale and lichen-crusted branches massed in serving pieces that Spry raided, to the amusement of her royal client, from his Meissen dinner set. No one flinches at similar combinations in unorthodox holders today, but as a practitioner of ''flower decorating,'' a term she insisted on, Spry broke new ground rescuing humble materials that usually went out with the wheelbarrow, including grasses, berries and vegetables. As the garden writer Beverley Nichols noted, Spry was ''the first floral artist who ever walked straight from the herbaceous border to the cabbage patch.'' There hasn't been anything truly new in floristry since Spry died in 1960 at age 73, a point of which readers of a new biography, ''The Surprising Life of Constance Spry'' (Macmillan), by Sue Shephard, are easily persuaded."
2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"HARVARD, founded in 1636, enjoyed a monopoly in the colonies for more than half a century, when it was joined by the College of William & Mary. If there existed a student organization in all that time, it left no fossil evidence. Harry R. Lewis, a former dean of Harvard College who has studied its history, explains: ''The college was run by Puritans and Calvinists. Students had to turn out for chapel at a certain time. They couldn't make noise. The college was not student-friendly.'' (Indeed, its first schoolmaster, Nathaniel Eaton, was forced to step down for starving students and wielding a stick large enough, it was said, to kill a horse.) Early extracurricular activities involved huddling around books and periodicals outside the curriculum -- and out of which, according to archivists and librarians, would come respect for debate, polished argument and the American Revolution.

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"From one end, this concrete and glass house looks as if it had burst through the rocks on which it stands. From the other, it seems to nestle into them, a civilized shelter in a wild setting. Of course, the reality involves inspired design and engineering, but the appearance is magical nonetheless. The house was designed as a weekend getaway for Merrill Wright, a Seattle resident, by Tom Kundig, of the local firm Olson Kundig Architects, who is known for houses that are both elegantly rugged and eminently livable. It occupies a 15-acre site in the San Juan Islands off Washington State. A compact, 2,200-square-foot box with a sod roof and tall steel-framed windows, the house consists of a main space, 61 feet long and 12 feet high, with a large kitchen at the back and a living and dining area overlooking the water up front. There's also a master bedroom and sitting room as well as a small guest room on the main floor, and another guest room tucked beneath the house. What looks like a wood-sided boxcar pierces the house at the kitchen end; it contains a utility shed outdoors and a pantry-laundry room and bookcases indoors. (Chris Gerrick was the project manager, and Charlie Fairchild worked with Wright on the interiors.)"

He wrote the screenplay for ''Braveheart,'' which won the Academy Award for best picture and earned him a nomination for best original screenplay in 1996. He is also a novelist, songwriter, producer and director, and even has a black belt. What he is not is a horseman, and yet one would never guess that after viewing ''Secretariat,'' which he directed and which has grossed more than $46 million domestically. The realistic race scenes, the showcasing of horses as both tenacious athletes and lovable creatures, and the care given to conveying the intricacies of a cutthroat industry all contribute to the allure of this film."

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"AT first listen, ''We R Who We R,'' the current single from the pop singer Ke$ha, sounds like just another entry in her glitter-caked catalog of dance hits. Eccentrically spelled song title? Check. Effervescent electro-pop production courtesy of the megaproducer Dr. Luke? Check. Ample use of Auto Tune? Double check. But ''We R Who We R'' has a subtext: It is intended as a response to the recent rash of suicides by gay teenagers and young adults, several of whom were close to Ke$ha's age. (She is 23.) ''It's heartbreaking,'' said the singer, who has sold upward of 29 million tracks worldwide since her first album, ''Animal,'' made its debut at No. 1 in January, with lyrics about brushing her teeth with whiskey. She called her latest single an anthem for those ''who haven't felt accepted because of their sexuality,'' a torch song for ''people being themselves unapologetically.''"

Back when the designer was a student at the Royal College of Art, she began crafting dolls out of old ''jumpers,'' the British word for sweaters. The leggy dolls without noses or mouths were picked up by Couverture, a chic lifestyle shop. Today, Wilson's quirky menagerie includes 30-odd creatures, like the charming hybrid Cyril Squirrel-Fox and Puddle Man (essentially a pool of water with a face), all of which are made from knitted lamb's wool in Wilson's East End workshop, not to mention cushions, throws, ottomans, sofas and rugs. Many of these are commissions from and collaborations with SCP, the British home furnishings manufacturer. The daughter of farmers, Wilson grew up in Banff in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and recalled an idyllic childhood playing in the fields. ''It was inside me but also encouraged by my grandma,'' Wilson said of her urge to make things. When she taught herself machine knitting, she discovered that she could ''replicate textures found in nature,'' and her memories filtered into her art in the form of natural landscapes and textures like moss, bark and stone. ''It still amazes me that you can create a fabric from a bit of yarn,'' she said."

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"At the London Design Festival in September, I came upon so many homespun, handmade objects and installations that within hours I was feeling guilty for not having made my own shoes. The prevailing aesthetic wasn't crafty, exactly -- and it certainly wasn't decorative -- but it was definitely hand-hewn, mostly in wood, with a less-is-more, whittled-down vibe (and I use the word ''whittled'' advisedly). You could see it in the tall, spindle-back settle and three-legged stools in the Seating for Eating collection, designed by Ilse Crawford's office, Studioilse, and made by De La Espada. These pieces capture the cozy, retro-rural look that Crawford has used in interiors projects like the Olde Bell Inn and the Crown Inn, which she designed with 6a Architects. Going with the grain Studioilse's Seating for Eating furniture.; 1. Alex Hellum's Ulrik stool for SCP. 2. Great Camp Dresser by Paul Loebach for MatterMade. 3. Day Bed One from Another Country. 4.

In a similar vein, the handmade products of Another Country, a British company headed by Paul de Zwart (the founding publisher of Wallpaper magazine), embody what it calls ''the spirit and functionality'' of country, Shaker, Scandinavian and Japanese archetypes. In fact, the pieces' simplicity and solidity won Another Country a spot in the shops run by Monocle magazine, the arbiter of ascetic cool."

I was 44, a lifelong jazz snob, who viewed the prospect of watching teenagers perform a musical with dread. We were going to see something called ''Sweeney Todd.'' I'd never heard of it. Music and lyrics by Mr. Sondheim. I had no clue. I can't recall the exact moment, but at some point during the first act I turned to my daughter with an astonished grin.

In the house we built on Shelter Island, I put a bright orange vintage Preway in the bedroom. I had to search far and wide, and finally found the right one on Craigslist. The Preway is no longer in production, but you can still get free-standing fireplaces from Malm, a company out in Santa Rosa, Calif., that has been making them with great proportions and clean lines since the 1960s. (The one above is available from Design Within Reach.) When I am making a piece of pottery, I know that it's finished -- and that it's good -- if it looks like it's supposed to be that way, like it's been uncovered rather than created. To me, that's a Malm fireplace. And I like that it's democratic, not precious. At its height of popularity, you were as likely to see one in a mobile home as you were in a groovy modernist manse. Those who dismiss these beauties as a bit of '70s nostalgia need to look again. I'm never happier than when I lie in bed and stare at my Preway, a glowing beacon of orange optimism in the corner of the room."

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"Throughout his recent run for Senate, the Florida Republican Marco Rubio made a big deal of the sacrifices his Cuban immigrant family made ''so that I could live the American dream.'' By campaign's end, he was using the phrase so regularly that spokesmen for his Democratic opponent, Congressman Kendrick B. Meek, were reminding reporters that Rubio did not have a patent on it. The American dream mattered a lot in this election. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative activist group, laid out plans for repealing President Obama's health care reform and fighting environmental regulation at its Defending the American Dream Summit two months ago. The president, meanwhile, closed this fall's campaign with an exhortation to ''restore the American dream for not just some, but for every, every, everybody in this great land.'' If both sides agree that the dream is imperiled, and that recovering it is a top national priority, then it may be this ''dream''of ours is not a unifying idea but a vague slogan, no more to be trusted than any other piece of campaign rhetoric. When the popular historian James Truslow Adams coined the phrase ''the American dream'' in ''The Epic of America'' (1931), it was as a kind of lazy-minded leitmotif. Sometimes it meant the frontier spirit, sometimes Jeffersonian democracy and sometimes just the hope that Americans could ''grow to fullest development as men and women, unhampered by the barriers which had slowly been erected in older civilizations.'' As a chronicler of common people, Adams had a peculiarity: he was a snob. He was dazzled by the material and cultural riches of aristocratic societies and bemoaned their lack in America. The American dream, he implied, is what we got as a consolation prize. It could find its expression in plebeian anti-intellectualism and an unjustified sense of entitlement. It was never, Adams admitted, ''a logical concept of thought.''"

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"Earlier in 1860, when Abraham Lincoln, the Illinois lawyer, looked at the electoral map, he made a stunning discovery: if he could win 16of the 17 northern states plus the west-ern states of California and Oregon, he'd have enough votes in the Electoral College to win the presidency. Forget the tempestuous South; even if every southern state fell into line be-hind one of his rivals -- Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois, Senator John Bell of Tennessee, Vice President John Breckenridge of Kentucky, the squab-bling standard bearers of the factions of the suicidally splintered Democratic party -- Lincoln could win with just the votes of the increasingly populated, firmly Free State North. And after the results from the state elections in October 1860 -- Pennsylvania had been suspect and Indiana iffy, but both tilted decisively toward the Republicans -- the erstwhile rail-splitter looked like he just might convert his audacious gamble.-- JAMIE MALANOWSKI, excerpt from'' Will Lincoln Prevail?''

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"While I agree wholeheartedly with Virginia Heffernan's assessment in The Medium that the partying, out-of-control woman is a particular object of fear and revulsion, I find it unfortunate that she used my comments as grist for her argument. My comments are not reserved exclusively for celebrities -- or for women. Let me be clear that I would have offered that same comment had the subject in question been a man. Furthermore, the use of my comments to support Heffernan's thesis that we ''demonize fun-loving women'' requires a complete disregard for the context in which they originally were made. I was responding to a question about what lengths I would go to, as a father, should one of my children (I have 17-year-old triplets) develop a life-threatening addiction, all other measures having been exhausted. As a clinician, I would never want to be coercive in relation to a patient, nor do I harbor the illusion that as a physician I am capable of forcing someone to change their behavior, no matter how detrimental to their health. Finally, I am not ''scheming to frame . . . party girls,'' hoping that they ''end up behind bars.'' An individual in police custody, however, is unable to do any further harm to himself or others, and I have seen firsthand how a forced choice between remaining in jail or entering a treatment program offers a lifesaving first step for those in the throes of addiction."

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"In 1924, the French designer Jean-Michel Frank collaborated with Hermès on a collection of furniture, including the Confortable armchair (below) and sofa, the elegant, cubic forms of which made it one of the most admired -- and widely copied -- designs of the 20th century. This month in Paris, for the inauguration of its new home division, Maison, Hermès is reintroducing these and other Frank pieces, including a straw-marquetry screen, a shagreen-covered vanity and the designer's X-base dining table. Robert Chavez, the president and C.E.O. of Hermès USA, sees ''a very exciting potential in the U.S.'' for the Jean-Michel Frank by Hermès collection, given the customer demand for furniture with the Hermès label. Previously, the company's furniture was limited to Pippa, a small collection by the architect Rena Dumas, who designed Hermès stores and who was married to Jean-Louis Dumas, the chairman of Hermès from 1978 to 2006. (Rena died in 2009, and Jean-Louis in May.) Their son, Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the company's artistic director and a sixth-generation member of the founding Hermès family, said starting Maison with historic designs was a deliberate strategy: ''We had to go backward to understand our roots and to go forward into the future.''

He used his surrealist sensibility to transform the space, a former boxing gym, into a hipster fun house. To enter the store, visitors navigate Card's ''deconstructed forest,'' only to find themselves in the belly of a beast -- a wooden tunnel that resembles a crudely assembled whale skeleton. The rest of the 6,000-square foot-space is divided into individual rooms, like a gallery hung with mannequins (left) and a library lined with asymmetrical shelving. ''Every room needed a distinct atmosphere, tone and temperature,'' Card says. ''The idea was to move from organic to industrial, from warm to cold. And always keep it open to change.'' The main attraction is the private club space, with its sound system by the legendary sound guru Mickey Boyle. For Card's sake, we hope the parties don't get too out of hand. ANA FINEL HONIGMAN"

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"For the last three decades, the Italian home products manufacturer Alessi has been at the forefront of design, producing instant icons like Michael Graves's bird-whistle teakettle (left), Philippe Starck's infamous Juicy Salif juicer and Richard Sapper's elegant espresso pot -- a fixture on many a yuppie's high-end cooktop. The Philadelphia Museum of Art is celebrating the 90-year-old company with an exhibition, ''Alessi: Ethical and Radical,'' which opens Nov. 21. Central to Alessi's success is its creative mastermind, Alberto Alessi, a grandson of the founder, who has run the company since the 1970s. ''He's absolutely unique in the amount of time and money that he has spent on design,'' said Kathryn Hiesinger, the exhibition's curator. Included in the show are planned reissues of designs from the 1920s, '30s and '40s, a time that Alberto Alessi describes as ''predesign,'' before the rise of glossy ''designer'' products -- which is ironic coming from the man who helped invent the category. But, as Heisinger explained, ''Alberto is now in his minimalist, simplicity mode; he's against overdesign.'' Well, he's been right before. ARLENE HIRST"

BEHIND THE NEWS With no room left to use its usual stimulus tool -- cuts in short-term rates, which are already near zero -- the Fed has been trying to pump some life into the economy through ''quantitative easing'' measures, like buying debt. Some critics saw risks that the Fed's debt buying would set the stage for high inflation once the economy revives; others said the new measures did not go far enough to make much difference."

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"The Department of Education has just published new rules to protect students from aggressive or misleading recruiting at for-profit institutions, and to provide consumers with information about program effectiveness. Next year, the department will put forth the most controversial aspect of its ''gainful employment'' rule: enforcement. It proposes curtailing federal aid to vocational programs whose former students have a loan repayment rate of less than 35 percent or a high debt-to-income ratio.James Kvaal, deputy undersecretary of education, says loan repayment rates give a better picture of hardship than the traditional default rate. In that rate, borrowers who don't have to make a payment -- say, because of forbearance, economic-hardship deferment or an income-based repayment plan -- ''are counted as successes,'' he says, ''despite being economically unable to afford their loan.'' During hearings on the new rules, the government released exhaustive repayment data for the first time. Though the statistics are on an institutional level (rules apply to programs), they shed light on the burden of debt across the board. Below is the data (2007-8 unless indicated) on the nation's largest four-year institutions, including those owned by publicly traded companies, as compiled by BMO Capital Markets."

He was 80 years old. The cause of death was leukemia. Kennedy was a prominent paper company executive who built Federal Paper Board Company of Montvale, New Jersey, into one of the nation's largest producers of paperboard. He joined Federal in 1952 after graduating from Georgetown University and spent his entire career with the company, serving as CEO from 1975 to 1996. He modernized and grew the company by making major investments in large paperboard and pulp mills in the South. Under his leadership, Federal's revenues increased from $175 million in 1974 to $1.9 billion in 1995, while earnings rose more than tenfold from $12 million to $142 million during the same period. In 1996, Kennedy negotiated the sale of the company to International Paper Company for $3.7 billion, providing a sizable return for Federal's shareholders. He was elected to the International Paper board of directors and continued to serve until he reached mandatory retirement age in 2002. He was also active in many educational and civic causes. He served on the board of directors of Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., from 1981 to 1987 and from 1993 to 2002. He was elected acting chair of the board in 1995 and served as chair from 1996 to 2002. He was a major financial contributor to the university. Kennedy Hall, which provides housing for Georgetown students, is named for him and his wife, Elizabeth. In addition, he was a former director of the Foreign Policy Association, the American Forest & Paper Association and the Duke University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and a former member of the board of governors of the United Nations Association of the United States of America. He was heavily involved with Pathfinder Village and a founder of the Kennedy-Willis Center on Down Syndrome. In 1997, he co-founded the nonprofit East Hampton Healthcare Foundation to provide medical care for the people of East Hampton, New York, where he had a summer home. The foundation operates a health care center and urgent-care walk-in facility. He was former vice chairman of the Indian River Medical Center Foundation, which raises funds for the Indian River Medical Center in Vero Beach, Florida, and was special adviser to the board at his death. He was a board member to the Riverside Theatre in Vero Beach, the Humane Society of Vero Beach and Vero Beach Museum of Art. Besides serving as a director of International Paper, the world's largest paper company, his corporate board memberships during his career included Chase Industries, Inc., Devlieg-Bullard Inc., First Fidelity Bancorporation, Holnam Inc., Idea Integration Corp., Magma Copper Company, MPS Group Inc., Pioneer Companies, Inc., American Mutual Insurance and Spartech Corporation. John R. ""Jack"" Kennedy was born in Queens, New York, on September 21, 1930. His parents, John R. Kennedy Sr. and Ethel Rose Leavy Kennedy, were both children of Irish Immigrants. Kennedy's marriage to his first wife, Joyce Willis, ended in divorce. In 1974, he married Elizabeth Spyros. Besides his wife, he is survived by three sons from his first marriage, John R. Kennedy III, Ponte Vedra, FL, James W. Kennedy, Amagansett, NY and Andrew Kennedy, Edmeston, NY; a daughter from his first marriage, Paula Kennedy Harrigan, New Canaan, CT; a stepson, Nicholas L. Spyros, Haymarket, VA; his sister, Ethel Kennedy Marran, Vero Beach, FL; his brother, Quentin Kennedy, Tenafly, NJ; and nine grandchildren. A viewing will be held on Sunday, November 7, 2010 from 47pm at Strunk Funeral Home, 916 17th Street, Vero Beach. A Mass of Christian Burial will take place on Monday, November 8 at 10:30am at Holy Cross Catholic Church, Iris Lane and A1A, Vero Beach.

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"''Hella Jongerius -- Misfit,'' the title of the Dutch designer's retrospective that opens Nov. 13 at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, refers not so much to her status in the design world but to the imperfect objects she has long championed. As the exhibition demonstrates, Jongerius has never had trouble finding sympathy for her ideas in the design industry, where companies like Vitra, Ikea and Maharam hired her to introduce beautiful inconsistencies into their sofas, vases and upholstery fabrics. As it turns out, the only people who ever took convincing were the craftspeople themselves. Royal Tichelaar Makkum's artisans cringed when they were told to fire her 1997 B-Set pottery (right) at too high a temperature, while Nymphenburg's worried that her 2004 Sketches plates looked half-finished. ''Craft has a tradition of trying to make perfect things,'' says Louise Schouwenberg, the show's curator. ''Hella told them to stop trying, because industry can do that better, whereas their appeal is more humane.'' Jongerius persisted, and these days, evidence of the hand of the maker seems completely natural. The misfits have become the mainstream. MONICA KHEMSUROV"

2010-11-07T00:00:00Z,"If you have your low-budget heart set on high-end islands like St. Bart's or St. Martin or Turks and Caicos this winter, with enough research and flexibility you may be able to pull it off. But the real way to keep costs down is to head to the lower-cost islands that actively compete for travelers with light wallets. The first rule is that the lower your budget, the greater the proportion that will be devoted to airfare. That's why the Bahamas is a good place to start looking this winter, when the islands' Ministry of Tourism offers airfare promotions. Under the Free Companion Airfare and Instant Air Credit, travelers who book a four-night stay at certain hotels (some under $150 a night) will get either a companion ticket free or a $300 ''instant air credit.'' Travel must be booked by Dec. 1. Even if you don't stay in a hotel covered by the deal, the Bahamas is one of the cheaper destinations to fly this winter, at least from New York. On the other hand, the relative lack of all-inclusive resorts means that it's trickier to keep costs down for meals and other activities once you're there."

But they are manifestations of a cultural shift that happened after the so-called Judgment of Paris in 1976, in which a number of California wines were deemed superior to their French counterparts. On Nov. 20, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art will open ''How Wine Became Modern: Design + Wine 1976 to Now.'' Organized by Henry Urbach, the museum's curator of architecture and design, the exhibition -- which is designed by the architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro -- explores the evolution of wine's visual and material culture. It includes a gallery devoted to the subject of terroir, a commissioned wall work by Peter Wegner that charts more than 200 paint colors with names like Cabernet and Crush, and a look at, among other issues, the effect of architecture on wine tourism. The museum knows the subject well, having organized the first architectural competition for the design of a winery, in 1985. The winner was the architect-artist team of Michael Graves and Edward Schmidt, resulting in Clos Pegase, the prototype of the modern designer winery. PILAR VILADAS"
