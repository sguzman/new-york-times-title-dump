2013-03-01T00:00:00Z,"McKEE--James W. James W. McKee Jr. passed away February 27, 2013 in Naples, FL, after a brief illness. The son of James W. and Isabel McKee, he was born in Pittsburgh, August 19, 1922. Business relocation took the family to Montreal in 1934, where Jim graduated with distinction, first from Lower Canada College, and then from McGill University. During World War II he was a pilot who served initially as an instructor, before being assigned as a command pilot to the 9th Air Force in England and in France. In 1946 Jim joined Corn Products Refining Company (name changed to CPC International in 1969), a diversified food manufacturer of well known trademarks including Mazola, Hellmann's (mayonnaise), Thomas's (English Muffins), Skippy (peanut butter), and Knorr (soups and sauces), as well as the world's leading corn wet milling company. He spent his first 17 years with CPC on international assignments, primarily in Italy, Brazil and Cuba. In 1969, five years after relocating back to the United States he was appointed company president, followed by the appointment to CEO in 1972, the youngest CEO in the company's history. During his tenure as president and CEO, and until he retired in 1984, the company's sales quadrupled to exceed $4.3 billion and earnings growth compounded at just under 9% per year. In addition to CPC International, Jim served on a number of corporate boards of directors, including Marine Midland Bank, Melville Corporation, CVS, and Singer. He was president of the Conference Board; a member of the Council on Foreign Affairs; head of the Grocery Manufacturer's Association; and head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Brazil in the early 1960's. He served as a trustee for several organizations, including St. Vincents Hospital, The College of New Rochelle, and the Committee for Economic Development, among others. The government of Brazil honored him twice with the country's highest civilian award, the Cruzeiro Do Sul medals for his contributions to Brazil's economy and to Brazilian/American relations. He also received honorary citations from the Geographic Society of Brazil, and the Union Cultural, among others for outstanding contributions. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from St. John's University for his academic and professional contributions in the field of economics, in particular, operating in inflationary environments. In retirement, Jim researched the McKee family genealogy, and self published the results in 2002: The Descendents of William and Mary Wilson McKee. Among his hobbies were his golf game (three holes-in-one), his computer, visiting hardware stores, reading books and newspapers, and managing investments. Jim is survived by his beloved wife of 65 years, Jayne (Finnegan); daughter Bettina McKee of Naples, FL; son James W. McKee III (wife, Pamela) of Charlotte, NC; daughter Sheila McKee of Boston, MA; two grandsons and two great-granddaughters. He was preceded in death by his brother, Robert McKee.

On a more personal note, we will remember John for his wisdom, gentleness, honesty, intellectual rigor, strength of character and frequent unstinting efforts and generosity on behalf of people less fortunate. Most recently, John and Wendy spent days serving meals on site to the victims of Superstorm Sandy and petitioning governmental leaders to take more rapid action. We extend our sincere condolences to Wendy, all of the members of John and Wendy's immediate and extended family, including his adored Luke, as well as his wide circle of friends. The Board of Directors, Officers and Employees of Hugo Neu Corporation"

2013-03-01T00:00:00Z,"The acclaimed documentary “How to Survive a Plague,” about the genesis of the AIDS epidemic, could become a television miniseries. The Hollywood Reporter said Thursday that ABC Studios, a production company owned by the Disney/ABC Television Group, had bought the rights to the documentary so it could develop a dramatic miniseries about HIV-positive young men who, as the title implies, beat the medical odds.
 
 David France , who co-wrote and directed the documentary, said, “We’d like it to be an extended story that’s not just about AIDS and what AIDS wrought, but about this tremendous civil rights movement that grew from the ashes of AIDS and the dawn of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender movement.” He said that ABC Studios was a logical home for such a miniseries: “ABC is the network of ‘Roots.’”"

2013-03-01T00:00:00Z,"GRANITO--Frank H.,Jr. Frank H. Granito, Jr., of Stamford, CT died suddenly on February 27, 2013 at the age of 81. Affectionately known as Ditto, he was born August 8, 1931 in New York City to Dr. Frank and Nora Granito. Frank grew up happily in the Bronx and attended Cardinal Hayes High School (where he was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2004), the University of Chicago, Fairfield University and St. John's Law School. During the 1950's and 60's, Frank served as a Naval Aviator with the Pacific Fleet and with the Naval Reserve, flying a variety of fighter and attack aircraft. A renowned aviation law specialist, Frank spent the past 46 years with his firm, Speiser, Krause, Nolan & Granito and for the past 25 years practiced law with his son Frank. He was a mentor to many. As an active trial lawyer representing families of aviation disasters, Frank was involved in nearly every major aviation case of the past 50 years. Notably, among the cases Frank participated in were the following air disaster litigations: Mohawk Airlines, Rochester (1963); United Airlines, Parrotsville (1964); Canadian Pacific Airways, Tokyo (1966); Overseas National Airways, St. Croix (1970); TWA 707, Ionian Sea (1974); Eastern Airlines Flight 66, JFK (1975 ); Texasgulf Aviation (1981); Spantax DC-10, Spain (1982); LOT Polish Airlines, Warsaw (1987); Pan Am Flight 103 (1988); Avianca Flight 052 (1990); Action Air B-99, Bridgeport (1994); USAir DC-9, Charlotte (1994); USAF CT-43, Croatia (1996); TWA Flight 800 (1996); Swissair Flight 111 (1998); Egyptair Flight 990 (1999); AA Flight 587 (2001) and the litigation arising from the 9/11 tragedy. Frank was instrumental in continuing the fight of the Pan Am 103 families in holding Libya accountable for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. The historic settlement resulted in compensation for the Pan Am 103 families and the framework for renewed diplomatic relations between Libya and the United States. Frank and his colleagues who negotiated the settlement with Libya were awarded the 2009 Public Justice Trial Lawyer of the Year Award. Frank was an adjunct professor of aviation law at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and a frequent lecturer at Fordham and St. John's Law Schools. He lectured and wrote extensively about aviation, choice of law and trial practice. His expertise was renown. When he wasn't at work, he was most times painting or attending to his memoirs, with a keen ability to recall events of many decades ago with mystifying detail. Extremely proud of his Bronx roots, Frank maintained lifelong friendships with his pals from Clason Point, Cardinal Hayes and St. John's. Equally proud of his service to our country, he held annual reunions with his squadron mates. And his cadre of warhorse aviation lawyers, the Sunshine Boys, held monthly ""lunch meetings"" to reminisce of days gone by. Frank was a devout Catholic and a person who quietly but generously supported those many causes near and dear to his heart. He was happiest when surrounded by his family, especially his wonderful grandchildren of whom he was so proud, and his beautiful bride whom he cherished so dearly. Frank is survived by his wife of 56 years, Helen Elizabeth ""Betty"" Altieri. He was the proud father of Catherine and Tim Langan, Frank III and Monica, Nora and Dan Harris and John and Luci. Frank was blessed with 16 grandchildren: Timmy, Matty, Mark and John Langan, Frank IV, Jimmy Joe, Jake, Catherine and Gunnar Granito, Cathleen, Will, Peter and Charlie Harris, John and Julia Granito. Frank was predeceased by his grandson Luke Langan. Brother of Nora (Cass) Chomicz, Gennaro (Maureen), Eileen (Andy) Simons, Sheila (Don) Dunphy. Predeceased by his sister Margaret Rose and brother John Teeple. Brother-in-law of Richard (Sharon) Altieri, Jimmy (Geri) Altieri and Johnny (Kathleen) Altieri, and loving uncle to many nieces and nephews and grandnieces and grandnephews.

She followed current events closely, reading The New York Times from cover-to-cover each day. She had a remarkable ability to relate to younger generations, and despite the difference in age, her nieces and nephews (and great-nieces and great- nephews) routinely looked to her for guidance and friendship in all aspects of life.

She was the first child of Nathan and Florence Whitfield of Montclair, NJ and was born on March 8, 1928, fittingly on International Women's Day as she would become a pioneer in a male-dominated field and an agent of change with regard to women's rights. She earned a BA in Sociology from Antioch College, where she was Community Manager and worked with Douglas McGregor. She earned an MA in Social-Psychology from Columbia University. In 1950, Edie went to Bethel, Maine to learn from and work with National Training Laboratories (NTL) in Applied Behavioral Science. She met Charlie Seashore there when he was a participant in a group she was training. They became collaborators and married, celebrating 52 years together before Charles's death in January. While at NTL, Edie became increasing connected to the field of group dynamics. She became first female president of NTL at a critical time in the organization. She was a consultant in organization development (OD) with clients including Bell Telephone Systems, Walter Reed Hospital, the Defense Mapping Agency, and the U.S. Naval Academy. She co-founded the Lewin Institute for Social Change, Action and Research and was the board co-chair for many years. With the late Morley Segal, she co-founded the American University/NTL Masters Program in OD. She taught at numerous other universities including Johns Hopkins, University of Massachusetts, Pepperdine, and Concordia and in many countries. In 2001, she was recognized by the OD Network with a Lifetime Achievement Award. Edie was a true optimist and could weave a great story out of any situation. Recently she wrote a six-word memoir of her life: ""Marriage, Family, Career had it all!"" She not only saw the good in others, she brought it out. Edie is survived by her daughters Becky and Kim and her sons-in-law C.J. and Jeff, her brother and sister-in-law, Alan and Diane, siblings-in-law Marjorie and Dick Seashore, and grandchildren Benjamin, Natalie, Nathan, Nick, and Ella. She is lovingly remembered and missed by her family, and her many colleagues, students and friends around the world. Donations in Edie's memory can be made to Seashore Memorial Fund at NTL Institute for Applied Behavioral Science (www.ntl.org) at Antioch College (https://donate. antiochcollege.org/).

After attending local schools, he received a B.A. degree from Miami University of Ohio followed by a law degree from Brooklyn Law School. As a young man in New York, Norm started his career as a lawyer. Seeking more of a challenge, he embarked on the first of many diversified interests. Norm was founder, builder, and co-owner of the nationally renowned Wall Street Racquet Club. The distinctive tennis bubbles on the eastside piers were featured for many years in movies and New York City postcards. In the early 80's Norm started Diamond Portfolio, Ltd., the selling-arm of a major DeBeers sight buyer. Norm's firm was rated ""Best"" three years consecutively in an independent survey of 142 gem companies. In the mid 90's Norm accepted a special project in Boise, Idaho. Upon completion of this business, Norm realized Boise was where he wanted to settle. Never idle, Norm formed the Sleepy Hollow Construction Company and designed and built two houses. Norm enjoyed travel, hunting and deep sea fishing in Mexico during the winter. In Norm's last years he devoted all of his time and efforts to the Idaho Humane Society. The years spent in Boise were his ""most content and happiest."" Norm embraced life fully and with great enthusiasm. Norm will be remembered by many in New York and Boise. If anyone wishes to make a contribution in Norm's memory, please donate to the Easy Fund of the Idaho Humane Society, 4775 West Dorman Street, Boise, ID 83705. Norm is survived by a son, daughter, and grandchildren. At Norm's request, no services will be held."

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"ROSS--Mary Riepma Cowell. Mary Riepma Cowell Ross, a retired lawyer and past President of the New York Women's Bar Association, died at age 102 on February 2, 2013 at her apartment in the Pierre Hotel in New York. The cause was old age; by her own account, she was ""a tough old bird"" from a long-lived family. Mrs. Ross was one of the early generation of women lawyers who gained a toehold in major law firms because of staff shortages in World War II. She was also active in arts and educational philanthropy. Born in Oklahoma City in 1910, Mrs. Ross attended the University of Nebraska - Lincoln (where she pledged Delta Gamma) and graduated from Vassar in 1932 and received her law degree from Memphis State University. In the early 1940's she worked for the United States government in Washington, chiefly in the Office of Alien Property. She moved to New York in 1946 to work for what is now Rogers & Wells, where she became an expert in wills, trusts and estates. ""I never would have gotten with them if it hadn't been for the war. Of course the head of my department told me, right at the start, they'd never make me a partner because I was a woman"" she said in 1993. Mrs. Ross served on various committees of the American Bar Association, Bar Association of the City of New York and the New York Women's Bar Association, including its Committee for Equal Opportunities for Women in the 1940's. She served as President of the womens' group in 1955-1957. She left Rogers & Wells in 1961 to begin private practice, and also became active in philanthropic work, serving on the Board of the Merce Cunningham Dance Foundation, the Central Park Community Fund, the University of Nebraska Foundation, and other organizations. In the 1970's and 1980's she competed in amateur ballroom dance events and in 1989 she established the Mary Riepma Ross Film Theatre at the University of Nebraska. She is predeceased by her brother, Siert F. Riepma, and sisters Freda Riepma, Lt. Col. Marjorie L. Riepma and Anna Marie Riepma Gray. She is survived by one nephew and three nieces and their children, including her fellow Delta Gamma, Olivia Gray, with whom she often exchanged the secret handshake. Her first marriage ended in divorce; her second husband, John Ogg Ross, died in 1966. In the last years of her life, she was attended with great care and tenderness by her long time housekeeper, Sigrid Dias, and Joan Kiernan with her crew of nurses, including Patricia Campbell, Teresa Cassels, Teresa Hanlon, Katherine McSweeney and Marie O'Connor."

A soprano who has been fatally stabbed is briefly stuffed in its trunk, and the final duet, with the soprano dying in her father’s arms, takes place at the car’s rear, framed by fins and tail lights.
 
Traditionally, that scene is set on a riverbank in Renaissance Italy, bu the Met’s new production of the Verdi opera, directed by Michael Mayer, transports the action to 1960 Las Vegas. The Cadillac is the real thing, bought on eBay, then painted indigo blue with metallic flecks by the Met staff and illuminated by the lighting designer, Kevin Adams, to reach the high C of automotive fantasy."

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"If you have teenage children and have been considering sending them to an expensive private school, you can save a lot of money by watching “Restless Virgins,” a made-for-television movie Saturday on Lifetime that was inspired by real events. This unpleasant tale might lead you not only to home-school the youngsters but also never to let them out of the house again.
 
The story, based on the nonfiction book “Restless Virgins: Love, Sex and Survival in Prep School” by Abigail Jones and Marissa Miley, is set at the fictional Sutton Academy and centers on a scandal precipitated by a student sex tape. The circumstances have been altered considerably, but the story is inspired by a 2005 incident at Milton Academy in Massachusetts that involved members of the boys’ hockey team and led to expulsions."
2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"THESE are hard times for trying to promote, much less make, peace between Palestinians and Israelis. The rise of political Islam, Syria’s civil war and looming implosion, and the Iranian nuclear imbroglio not only dominate the environment, but they also render it forbidding for peacemaking. And while all these factors make Israelis and Palestinians reluctant to take risks for peace, they do not represent the biggest hurdle for ending the conflict. The most fundamental problem between Israelis and Palestinians is the problem of disbelief.
 
Most Israelis and Palestinians today simply don’t believe that peace is possible. I won’t rehearse all the reasons both sides have lost faith. Suffice it to say that Israelis feel that their withdrawal from territory (like southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip) has not brought peace or security; instead, it has produced only violence. Why, then, should they repeat the same mistake and subject themselves to far greater, even existential, risk in the West Bank? Meanwhile, Palestinians believe that negotiations from 1993 onward failed to produce independence but instead yielded a huge Israeli settler presence in their midst."

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"BRIDGES--William Emery 1933-2013. The author, teacher and consultant whose pioneering work on transition transformed the way people think about change, died on February 17, 2013, at his home in Larkspur, California, from complications of Lewy Body Disease. His death was confirmed by his wife, Susan Bridges. He was 79. Through his books, including Transitions and Managing Transitions, his public speaking and the international network of experts he certified to coach people, Mr. Bridges had a global impact upon educators, psychologists, corporate executives, business consultants and non-profit leaders as well as the general public. The Wall Street Journal named him one of the top ten executive development presenters in America. As John Alexander, former CEO of the Center for Creative Leadership, observed, ""Bill's contribution was incalculable. He gave us a vocabulary for understanding and talking about change that was entirely absent before. He helped us understand how people actually experience change and what they need to get through it."" William Emery Bridges was born in Boston in 1933, the son of Ronald Perkins Bridges and Helen Emery Bridges. He lived as a young child in Maine, Arizona and California. He received his BA in English from Harvard, his MA in American History from Columbia and his PhD in American Civilization from Brown University. He served in the US Army in Germany. He married Ramonda Kump in 1959. Mr. Bridges held the Aurelia Henry Reinhard Professorship of American Literature position at Mills College in Oakland, California, in the late 1960's, when he became interested in the psychology of literature. In 1970, he led a three-week training program in humanistic and depth psychology, bringing some of the era's most influential thinkers together. He would later become President of the Society for Humanistic Psychology. In 1980 he published Transitions: Making Sense of Life's Changes. In it he set forth the idea that, while change was situational, transition was psychological, and needed to be better understood, especially in America where change is both endemic and rapid. Transitions proposed that individuals experience change in three stages: first as an ending, followed by a period of confusion and distress, and then followed by a new beginning. He noted that because Western culture offers few rituals to mark the passage through these stages, people often try to skip from the first stage directly to the last. Instead, he asked individuals to spend time in what he called ""the neutral zone"" as a way of psychologically accommodating the space between. The book struck a strong chord with readers and it was followed by Managing Transitions: Making the Most of Change in 1991, also a national best-seller and now in its third edition. In 2001, he published The Way of Transition: Embracing Life's Most Difficult Moments, which in part explored the pain of his own transition following the death of his first wife, Mondi, of breast cancer. In 1994, he published JobShift: How to Prosper in a Workplace Without Jobs, which was excerpted and featured on the cover of Fortune Magazine. Exploring the consequences of flattening hierarchies and the disappearance of management jobs that characterized the recession of the early 1990's, Mr. Bridges accurately predicted the explosive growth of self-employment and helped people understand how to prepare for a world in which secure jobs would be increasingly scarce. In the 1980's, he began consulting with individuals and organizations about managing transition. He founded William Bridges & Associates and developed customized training programs for organizations experiencing transition. These programs were conducted worldwide. In 1998, he married Susan Mitchell, a colleague and established leadership development consultant, who joined him as a partner in the business. Mrs. Bridges became President of William Bridges and Associates in 2007. In 2000, Mr. Bridges was approached by Steven Kelban, Executive Director of the Andrus Family Fund, a division of the Surdna Foundation. The Andrus Family Fund makes grants to non-profits working in foster care and community reconciliation. They began a collaboration that Mr. Kelban said has made a substantial difference in helping both young people and damaged communities adapt to change by incorporating transition management principles. Jim Kouzes, author of The Leadership Challenge, noted, ""Bill's major contribution was to give us permission to talk about the pain and difficulty of change and acknowledge that it can be very confusing. Americans have shame around pain--success is somehow supposed to be easy. If you're struggling, it's as if you've failed. Bill moved past that relentless optimism and said, yes, you can find real meaning in change but only if you are willing to experience the pain."" Tom Yeomans, founder of The Concord Institute, notes that the Emersonian tradition continued to affect Mr. Bridges' work. ""Trust informed Bill's process and trust is the core idea of self-reliance--trusting your instinct, what you know, your potential to be more truly yourself, trusting the process of change and moving with it. Bill's work was profoundly consistent, built on the recognition of a deep human pattern, but he found many ways to develop it. Because he remained deeply connected to Emerson and the transcendentalists, he helped open organizations and individuals to the possibility of transcendence."" Mr. Bridges is survived by his wife, Susan Bridges, his daughters from his first marriage, Anne Gavin (Curtis Gavin), Sarah Bridges, and Margaret Bridges, seven grandchildren, and his brother, Daniel Bridges. Memorial services are pending. Donations may be made to the UCSF Foundation for the ""William and Susan Bridges Neurohospitalist Program Fund B2390"" and sent to S. Andrew Josephson MD, Director, Neurohospitalist Program, UCSF, 505 Parnassus Ave, Box 0114, San Francisco, CA 94143."

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"Quotes are the mental furniture of my life. From certain angles my inner landscape resembles a gallery hung with the rags and tag-ends of a lifetime of reading and listening. They can be anything at all, the exquisitely chiseled perceptions of poets or the blurts of unscheduled truth-telling by public figures caught in the spotlight; the punch lines of 1930s comedians or the curtain lines of Jacobean dramatists. They are the dangling threads that memory can latch onto when everything else goes blank. 
 
What is the use of quotations? They have, of course, their practical applications for after-dinner speakers. But the gathering of such fragments responds to a much deeper compulsion. It resonates with the timeless desire to seize on the minimal remnant out of which the world could, in a pinch, be reconstructed. Libraries may go under, cultures may go under, but single memorizable bits of rhyme and discourse persist over centuries."

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"GRANITO--Frank H.,Jr. Frank H. Granito, Jr., of Stamford, CT died suddenly on February 27, 2013 at the age of 81. Affectionately known as Ditto, he was born August 8, 1931 in New York City to Dr. Frank and Nora Granito. Frank grew up happily in the Bronx and attended Cardinal Hayes High School (where he was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2004), the University of Chicago, Fairfield University and St. John's Law School. During the 1950's and 60's, Frank served as a Naval Aviator with the Pacific Fleet and with the Naval Reserve, flying a variety of fighter and attack aircraft. A renowned aviation law specialist, Frank spent the past 46 years with his firm, Speiser, Krause, Nolan & Granito and for the past 25 years practiced law with his son Frank. He was a mentor to many. As an active trial lawyer representing families of aviation disasters, Frank was involved in nearly every major aviation case of the past 50 years. Notably, among the cases Frank participated in were the following air disaster litigations: Mohawk Airlines, Rochester (1963); United Airlines, Parrotsville (1964); Canadian Pacific Airways, Tokyo (1966); Overseas National Airways, St. Croix (1970); TWA 707, Ionian Sea (1974); Eastern Airlines Flight 66, JFK (1975 ); Texasgulf Aviation (1981); Spantax DC-10, Spain (1982); LOT Polish Airlines, Warsaw (1987); Pan Am Flight 103 (1988); Avianca Flight 052 (1990); Action Air B-99, Bridgeport (1994); USAir DC-9, Charlotte (1994); USAF CT-43, Croatia (1996); TWA Flight 800 (1996); Swissair Flight 111 (1998); Egyptair Flight 990 (1999); AA Flight 587 (2001) and the litigation arising from the 9/11 tragedy. Frank was instrumental in continuing the fight of the Pan Am 103 families in holding Libya accountable for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. The historic settlement resulted in compensation for the Pan Am 103 families and the framework for renewed diplomatic relations between Libya and the United States. Frank and his colleagues who negotiated the settlement with Libya were awarded the 2009 Public Justice Trial Lawyer of the Year Award. Frank was an adjunct professor of aviation law at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and a frequent lecturer at Fordham and St. John's Law Schools. He lectured and wrote extensively about aviation, choice of law and trial practice. His expertise was renown. When he wasn't at work, he was most times painting or attending to his memoirs, with a keen ability to recall events of many decades ago with mystifying detail. Extremely proud of his Bronx roots, Frank maintained lifelong friendships with his pals from Clason Point, Cardinal Hayes and St. John's. Equally proud of his service to our country, he held annual reunions with his squadron mates. And his cadre of warhorse aviation lawyers, the Sunshine Boys, held monthly ""lunch meetings"" to reminisce of days gone by. Frank was a devout Catholic and a person who quietly but generously supported those many causes near and dear to his heart. He was happiest when surrounded by his family, especially his wonderful grandchildren of whom he was so proud, and his beautiful bride whom he cherished so dearly. Frank is survived by his wife of 56 years, Helen Elizabeth ""Betty"" Altieri. He was the proud father of Catherine and Tim Langan, Frank III and Monica, Nora and Dan Harris and John and Luci. Frank was blessed with 16 grandchildren: Timmy, Matty, Mark and John Langan, Frank IV, Jimmy Joe, Jake, Catherine and Gunnar Granito, Cathleen, Will, Peter and Charlie Harris, John and Julia Granito. Frank was predeceased by his grandson Luke Langan. Brother of Nora (Cass) Chomicz, Gennaro (Maureen), Eileen (Andy) Simons, Sheila (Don) Dunphy. Predeceased by his sister Margaret Rose and brother John Teeple. Brother-in-law of Richard (Sharon) Altieri, Jimmy (Geri) Altieri and Johnny (Kathleen) Altieri, and loving uncle to many nieces and nephews and grandnieces and grandnephews.

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"Why do European countries have lower levels of poverty and inequality than the United States? We used to think this was a result of American anti-government sentiment, which produced a government too small to redistribute income or to attend to the needs of the poor. But over the past three decades scholars have discovered that our government wasn’t as small as we thought. Historians, sociologists and political scientists have all uncovered evidence that points to a surprisingly large governmental presence in the United States throughout the 20th century and even earlier, in some cases surpassing what we find in Western Europe.
 
For example, European banks did not have to contend with regulations separating commercial and investment banking, as American banks did under the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. Until the 1980s taxes on capital income were higher in the United States than in most European countries, where taxes on labor were and still are higher. American bankruptcy law has been harder on creditors and easier on debtors than any of the countries of Europe, even after bankruptcy reform here in 2005. Or consider the famous case of the thalidomide babies in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Thalidomide was a drug given to pregnant women for nausea. It caused devastating birth defects, from stunted limbs to spina bifida, and many babies died. Thalidomide was widely available in Europe and produced thousands of cases of birth defects there. But the Food and Drug Administration kept thalidomide off the American market, successfully using aggressive governmental intervention to protect children from a pharmaceutical company with a dangerous product. They would be in their early 50s now, those babies saved by the F.D.A. I wonder sometimes how many of them are walking around today complaining about big government."

Mia Hamm had begged off, so Chastain took her place. She was not averse to the spotlight. Her nickname was Hollywood. Teammate Julie Foudy referred to Chastain as her favorite actress.She was unfailingly pleasant and accommodating. After one World Cup match, Chastain tossed a pair of cleats to a fan who had chased the team bus.

The 1999 World Cup was then the largest sporting event ever held for women. The championship game against China distilled itself to a penalty-kick shootout. Ninety thousand fans crowded into the Rose Bowl. An estimated 40 million Americans watched some part of the match on television.Hamm did not want to take a penalty kick but was forced to. Chastain reveled in the moment, scored the decisive shot, and then removed her jersey, her chiseled physique presenting an iconic image of female strength and celebration.“You have to be willing to stand in front of the crowd and say, ‘I’m the one to take on the responsibility,’ ” Chastain said.

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"Andrew Mason, founder of the daily deals site Groupon, is a big goof. He was booted last week as chief executive, but didn’t let it cramp his style. Mr. Mason’s resignation letter, which he tweeted under the entirely reasonable notion that it would leak anyway, said he was leaving to spend more time with his family, the age-old alibi of dismissed chiefs everywhere. Then he came clean: “Just kidding — I was fired today.”
 
Mr. Mason added a dose of humor to what many can only hope will be a new kind of corporate goodbye: the honest one. Carol Bartz, a former Yahoo chief, was a pioneer of this approach. “I’ve just been fired,” she told her staff in 2011, a comment that won her more respect than anything else in her brief tenure."

She followed current events closely, reading The New York Times from cover-to-cover each day. She had a remarkable ability to relate to younger generations, and despite the difference in age, her nieces and nephews (and great-nieces and great- nephews) routinely looked to her for guidance and friendship in all aspects of life.

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"McKEE--James W. James W. McKee Jr. passed away February 27, 2013 in Naples, FL, after a brief illness. The son of James W. and Isabel McKee, he was born in Pittsburgh, August 19, 1922. Business relocation took the family to Montreal in 1934, where Jim graduated with distinction, first from Lower Canada College, and then from McGill University. During World War II he was a pilot who served initially as an instructor, before being assigned as a command pilot to the 9th Air Force in England and in France. In 1946 Jim joined Corn Products Refining Company (name changed to CPC International in 1969), a diversified food manufacturer of well known trademarks including Mazola, Hellmann's (mayonnaise), Thomas's (English Muffins), Skippy (peanut butter), and Knorr (soups and sauces), as well as the world's leading corn wet milling company. He spent his first 17 years with CPC on international assignments, primarily in Italy, Brazil and Cuba. In 1969, five years after relocating back to the United States he was appointed company president, followed by the appointment to CEO in 1972, the youngest CEO in the company's history. During his tenure as president and CEO, and until he retired in 1984, the company's sales quadrupled to exceed $4.3 billion and earnings growth compounded at just under 9% per year. In addition to CPC International, Jim served on a number of corporate boards of directors, including Marine Midland Bank, Melville Corporation, CVS, and Singer. He was president of the Conference Board; a member of the Council on Foreign Affairs; head of the Grocery Manufacturer's Association; and head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Brazil in the early 1960's. He served as a trustee for several organizations, including St. Vincents Hospital, The College of New Rochelle, and the Committee for Economic Development, among others. The government of Brazil honored him twice with the country's highest civilian award, the Cruzeiro Do Sul medals for his contributions to Brazil's economy and to Brazilian/American relations. He also received honorary citations from the Geographic Society of Brazil, and the Union Cultural, among others for outstanding contributions. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from St. John's University for his academic and professional contributions in the field of economics, in particular, operating in inflationary environments. In retirement, Jim researched the McKee family genealogy, and self published the results in 2002: The Descendents of William and Mary Wilson McKee. Among his hobbies were his golf game (three holes-in-one), his computer, visiting hardware stores, reading books and newspapers, and managing investments. Jim is survived by his beloved wife of 65 years, Jayne (Finnegan); daughter Bettina McKee of Naples, FL; son James W. McKee III (wife, Pamela) of Charlotte, NC; daughter Sheila McKee of Boston, MA; two grandsons and two great-granddaughters. He was preceded in death by his brother, Robert McKee. A Mass of Christian burial will be held on Monday, March 4, 2013 at 10am at St. William Catholic Church, 750 Seagate Drive, Naples. Interment will be in St. Mary's Cemetery in Greenwich, CT.

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"ARNOLD--Robert Morris, of Seattle, noted banking executive, venture capitalist, and philanthropist died at his home in Palm Springs, California on Wednesday, February 27, 2013. Bob, as he was known to his legion of friends, died peacefully after a brief illness. He was 84. A lifelong resident of Seattle, with homes in San Francisco and Palm Springs, Mr. Arnold was prominent in Seattle banking circles as a long time Vice President and Director of the Seattle First National Bank. Additionally, he was a highly regarded angel and venture investor who possessed an uncanny eye for the next great idea. He was also a very active philanthropist who supported amongst other things the Fred C. Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the Seattle Art Museum, Swedish Medical Center and Yale University. Mr. Arnold graduated from the Lakeside School in Seattle, Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey and received his BA from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut in 1951. Following Yale, Mr. Arnold enlisted in the US Navy where he received his Aviator Wings in 1952. He flew jet fighter aircraft missions from two aircraft carriers, the Yorktown and Essex during and after the Korean War and retired as a Lieutenant, J.G. after his years of active duty service and a stint in the Naval Reserve. After his time in the service, he embarked on a career in finance, steadily working his way up through SeaFirst Bank. After the bank was sold in the early 1980s, Mr. Arnold turned his attention to venture financing and it was here he achieved his greatest business success. A pioneer in the field years before it became fashionable, he was attracted to the entrepreneurial spirit and the dynamism that evolved from the hatching of new and creative ideas. While he possessed the commensurate analytical skills to dissect a new deal, it was his ability to measure up the individual behind the deal that gave him an advantage. ""Bob was a true venture capitalist. His steady hand and perspective were second to none."" says longtime associate Cole Younger. His track record as an extremely successful investor and willingness to meet just about anyone with a good idea made him a favorite in the venture community. His fingerprints are all over some of the Pacific Northwest's most successful companies. Throughout his life, Mr. Arnold believed in giving back to the things he loved. Longstanding family ties to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Swedish Medical Center provided the catalyst for a lifetime of support. He loved the connection he had to these world class institutions but, more importantly, he loved what they were doing and how they were positively impacting lives. His support of the Seattle Art Museum was an extension of this philosophy. For decades he was a driving force behind this world class facility. Not only did he care deeply about the art, he wanted to ensure that his beloved Seattle had an art museum that could hold its own with any in the country. Finally, his connection to Yale was all encompassing. The years he spent there - the friends he made and the experiences he shared with them - provided the foundation from which he built his life. He made it a point to go to every reunion and stay in constant touch with his cadre of friends. In his spare time Mr. Arnold devoted himself to two passions - travel and friends. His itineraries were legendary in his never-ending quest to visit every country in the world. At the time of his death, he had traveled to 172 and had a new adventure on the books. His curiosity to experience different cultures and meet their people was unquenchable. However, it was his love of his friends, both old and new, that truly fueled him. To say he was a ""people person"" would be an understatement. Armed with a million stories and the style of a seasoned raconteur, he made countless friends throughout his life's journey. When he brought you into his orbit, there was no finer place to be. Not surprisingly Mr. Arnold was a longtime member of the Seattle Golf, Tennis and Yacht Clubs, the University Club and the Bohemian Club of San Francisco. He also enjoyed his role as a Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin (San Francisco chapter). Mr. Arnold is survived by his wife, Patricia Arnold, his two daughters, Grace Arnold of Rancho Sante Fe, California and Lauren Gorter of Lake Forest, Illinois, son-in-law David Gorter and two grandsons, Christopher and Taylor Gorter In lieu of flowers, the family has requested that contributions be given to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center the Seattle Art Museum or the Swedish Medical Center.

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"It has been four years since the ex-stage comedian Morgane Fleury opened her “cave-écologique” on Paris’ seedy Rue Saint-Denis to showcase the biodynamic bubbles that bear her family name. In the intervening years, the wonderfully chaotic Ma Cave Fleury has become a tightly held secret for a bohemian coterie of Parisian actors and musicians who revel in its unpretentious joie de vivre and affordable bottles (costing as little as €25). Its unassuming appearance and unlikely location amid X-rated stores in a gentrifying area belies the fact that it is the cellar door of the small respected Champagne house Fleury Père Et Fils.
 
Now in their fourth generation, the Fleurys are acknowledged as pioneers in winemaking. Morgane Fleury’s great grandfather Emile was the first to plant grafted pinot noir in the region after the invasion of phylloxera. Grandfather Robert took the unusual step of bottling his own grapes when they were refused by the “Grandes Marques” in 1929. And Morgane’s father, Jean-Pierre, was the first producer in the Champagne region to convert entirely to biodynamics in 1992."

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"“Torture is monotonous and sad,” muses Bruno (Michel Subor), the antihero hero of Godard’s “Petit Soldat.” When Bruno is tortured — doused, held under water, burned — it’s not at a black site, hidden from the world, but in a bright bathroom in Geneva, a cleanly anonymous modern space in the heart of Europe. In the next room a woman calmly reads Mao.
 
Made in 1960 but banned in France until 1963, “Le Petit Soldat” still feels daring and vital, both peculiarly timely and deeply Godardian, a meditation not just on politics and war — the Algerian conflict is the background — but also on morality and art. (Bruno has Godard’s famous line: “Cinema is truth at 24 frames a second.” More Bruno: “A gun is a beautiful object: black, mysterious, incorruptible.”) It’s also a love story. Bruno, part of a rightist French terrorist group, falls for Veronica (Anna Karina, in her debut), whose sympathies are with the Algerians.

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"PARIS — As I said in a previous post, Alber Elbaz saw the problem of all these fashion shows, running like a hamster wheel, each format virtually the same, and in his own way did something about it. But now I’ve seen Raf Simons’s Dior show , and also Undercover (by the amazing Jun Takahashi), and they all express a similar attitude — which is freedom. It sounds silly to say that of talented and well-paid designers, but there’s a reason you leave their shows feeling good.
 
I’ve seen editors sitting in a trance at shows, often at Prada and Céline, where there is as much an interest in what’s new as in the heart-pounding thought, Can it be mine? But it has been a while since I saw anyone watch a show with a smile on her face, as Ikram Goldman, the Chicago retailer, had during the Undercover show."

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"‘Throw Up On Your Own Time’
 
In his endless quest to emasculate his players and prove to them that he was the man, Bill Parcells perfected the art of being mean. He meticulously studied each of his players to figure outhis weaknesses. Then he harped on those faults to see which players were tough enough to survive his mind games. Parcells called players clowns and brainless idiots. He used cruelty to control those under him, making even millionaire marquee players wish they had never been born. Once, when he saw a Jets player throwing up from exhaustion at practice, he said, “Throw up on your own time.” When a Cowboys running back had along overdue long run in one game, Parcells bellowed in a packed locker room,“Ooh, did you call your mama to tell her you got by four or five players all by yourself?” In Dallas, he refused to call the famously arrogant wide receiver Terrell Owens by his given name, instead referring to him as “the player” or “this player” when talking about him to reporters in his trademark gravelly growl. Even when talking about family, the ever-miserable Parcells barely mustered a smile. Upon the birth of his third grandchild, he grumbled to a reporter as he frowned, “It’s another girl,” as if frustrated that he, despite his omnipotence, could not will the birth of a grandson.When speaking with reporters, heoften prefaced his comments with, “I’m not trying to be a jerk.” But many players over the years didn’t think he was ever trying to be a jerk. They just thought it came naturally."

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"There are obviously many playwrights in New York, but how many of them are distinctly New York writers? Who do you associate with this city in the way that fans of other art forms do with Woody Allen or Jay-Z?
 
For me Richard Greenberg, one of the most underrated artists in the American theater, is at the top of the list. While plays like “The Dazzle,” which is about two Collyer-brothers-like figures, evoke Manhattan history, dramas like “Take Me Out” and “Three Days of Rain” are not only set in contemporary New York but also display a sensibility distinct to this city. That’s what makes him a natural choice to write the new stage adaptation of “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” which was originally a 1958 novella by Truman Capote before being turned into a movie."

2013-03-03T00:00:00Z,"ATLAS--William, beloved brother, husband, father, uncle and grandfather, died peacefully in his sleep on February 27, at the venerable age of 98. An engineer since 1939, he opened his own firm in New York City in 1956, William Atlas Consulting Engineers. William worked full-time as owner and lead consulting engineer until 2009, when he sold the business at the age of 94. He retired to his home in Great Neck, NY to focus full time on his creative writing. Born in the Bronx on December 15, 1914, William graduated from the City College of New York in 1936, with a BS and MS in civil engineering. He married Ruth Kesselman in 1940, an early childhood educator who predeceased him in 1975. William Atlas Consulting Engineers, over the course of five decades, was responsible for the structural engineering of innumerable commercial, public, and religious projects, as well as private residences throughout the metropolitan area and nationwide. His life's work, as well as his quirky sense of humor and storytelling, will be fondly remembered by his sister Miriam; daughters and their spouses Susan (Jamie), Nancy (Bob), and Liz (Michael who predeceased him); and grandchildren Rachel (Matthew), Jonah and Hannah; as well as the many young engineers he trained over the years.

Both companies recently made their seasonal practices of matching prices at online retailers a year-round policy.
 
A new study of Amazon customers who research products in stores by Placed , a mobile analytics company, offers some insight into who else could be at the greatest risk of losing business to showrooming. The study relies on Placed’s panel of more than 14,000 mobile phone users who consent to have their locations tracked in exchange for store gift cards and other perks. Placed can tell when those people visit a particular retailer without them having to proactively report their store visits."

Suzuki’s sport utility vehicle    and another car collided at an intersection    near the Yankees’    spring training complex.

He said it was his first accident    as a driver, but he was hit by a car    when riding his bike while in high    school in Japan. He said that incident    had made him extra aware    of his surroundings when driving,    and also as a passenger.    “I’m probably the worst backseat    driver,” he said, “because I    see everything and I tell the driver,    ‘Be careful,’ a lot.”"

2013-03-04T00:00:00Z,"The revolving door of casting continues to spin at “Downton Abbey” as the popular PBS/”Masterpiece” period drama prepares for its fourth season. After a year in which the series lost the actors Dan Stevens, who played Matthew Crawley, and Jessica Brown Findlay, who played Lady Sybil (for reasons that the “Downton Abbey” creator Julian Fellowes explained here ), PBS announced over the weekend that some new faces would join the series and that a familiar one was returning. But another well-known co-star has also announced her exit.
 
 Shirley MacLaine , who appeared in Season 3 of “Downton Abbey” as Martha Levinson, the outspoken mother of Cora, Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern), and who served as a foil to the Dowager Countess (Maggie Smith), will return in Season 4, PBS said. Several new actors were announced for the series, including Tom Cullen, whose character, Lord Gillingham, is described as “an old family friend of the Crawleys who visits the family as a guest for a house party”; Harriet Walter who will play Lady Shackleton (“an old friend of the Dowager”); and Julian Ovenden as Charles Blake (an “aristocrat”). The soprano Kiri Te Kanawa will also appear on “Downton Abbey” as “a guest who sings in the house.”"

2013-03-04T00:00:00Z,"NEU--John L.,Our firm expresses its profound sorrow on the passing of our dear friend, John L. Neu. A highly successful businessman, John was an intellectual powerhouse, always eager to analyze and solve knotty problems. John would have had a brilliant legal career had he chosen to stay in practice instead of joining his father, who he loved and respected very much, in business. He grasped very complex legal issues with lightning speed and before you could turn around, John had figured out a creative solution to the issue or problem just presented. We enjoyed seeing the wry smile that came across his face at such moments or when he offered a bon mot. John always demonstrated sincere and kind appreciation for efforts made on his behalf. John, together with his adored wife Wendy, have lived their lives with integrity and a steadfast devotion to promoting the public good and to a multitude of charitable activities. Just as a most recent example, we shall never forget how eager John and Wendy were to help the victims of Superstorm Sandy -- to serve meals, give money for a variety of needed supplies, and enlist the aid of government representatives on their behalf. John's goodness was a blessing to his friends and family, but also to many he never knew. We express our deepest sympathies to Wendy, to all the members of the Neu and Kelman families and to the dedicated employees of Hugo Neu Corporation. Herrick, Feinstein LLP"

2013-03-04T00:00:00Z,"Sure, the ratings for the second season of NBC’s “Smash” have been low. The most recent episode fell to 3.3 million total viewers and it barely cleared the 1 million threshold in viewers between the ages of 18 and 49, the demographic most important to advertisers. But DVR viewing was crucial to buoying “Smash” in its first season . Will that be a help this time around? Probably not.
 
The latest DVR numbers released by Nielsen, which include the live ratings plus the next seven days of viewership, revealed that the Season 2 premiere of “Smash,” on Feb. 5, gained only about 900,000 viewers in the 18-to-49 category. That total signifies an increase of 58 percent for the category, a respectable number, but the show did not rank among the Top 25 broadcast programs that increased their audience through DVR usage in either total viewers or adults 18 to 49."

2013-03-04T00:00:00Z,"“Bull,” a drama about office politics by the British playwright Mike Bartlett (“The Cockfight Play”), will have its New York premiere in the Brits Off Broadway festival at 59E59 Theaters, the theater is to announce on Monday. The play, which is to begin performances on April 25, recently completed a run at the Crucible Studio in Sheffield, England, where it received good reviews . Mr. Bartlett’s “ Cockfight Play ” (the actual, monosyllabic title is unprintable here) ran Off Broadway in a well-received, extended run last year. (Ben Brantley of The New York Times included the production on his 2012 Top 10 list .) “Bull” was initially intended as a companion piece to “The Cockfight Play,” Mr. Bartlett said in an interview with The Sheffield Telegraph last month, and both plays were inspired by his experience watching a bullfight in Mexico. But while “Cockfight” is about a love triangle, “Bull” is about the often brutal and bullying world of office politics: Three workers know that one of them is about to be fired, and as they await the arrival of their boss, two gang up on the one who seems to be the weakest of the group. “Bull,” directed by Clare Lizzimore, joins the previously announced Brits festival lineup, which is to include “Good With People,” by David Harrower; “ Bullet Catch ” by Rob Drummond; a revival of J. B. Priestley’s “Cornelius,” starring Alan Cox; and several other productions. The festival runs from March 27 to June 30."

2013-03-05T00:00:00Z,"Just eight N.F.L. teams used their franchise tags by the Monday afternoon deadline, a steep drop from the 21 players who were tagged last season. The decline is likely an indication that even with a modest rise in the salary cap this year, most teams – many of which have gone on a wave of restructuring contracts in recent days to create cap space — found it too expensive to use the tag on any but the most critical players. This came a year after tag numbers that were reduced from the pre-lockout years were considered more palatable.
 
In the biggest moves, the Kansas City Chiefs, aggressively trying to reshape a 2-14 team into an instant contender, reached a long-term contract with receiver Dwayne Bowe, which allowed them to use the franchise tag on left tackle Branden Albert as the 4 p.m. EST deadline neared. That gives the Chiefs’ new quarterback Alex Smith – who will not be officially join the team until free agency opens next week and his trade goes through – his No. 1 receiver and his top bodyguard. The Chiefs’ decisions could also impact the top of the college draft. Before tagging Albert, the Chiefs were widely expected to use the first overall draft pick on Texas A&M tackle Luke Joeckel. With Albert in the fold, the Chiefs could still take Joeckel and move Albert inside to guard; take a player at another position, like cornerback Dee Milliner; or try to trade down in the draft."

I recall an argument (I mean discussion) with the restaurateur Danny Meyer, and we agreed in the end that Champagne was perfect with barbecue, as long as you steer clear of overly sweet sauce, which you should do anyway. For brisket (again, my Texas bias), I also suggest a red wine with firm acidity and a touch of smoke to echo the meat.

2013-03-06T00:00:00Z,"KELLEY--Brooks Mather, 83, a resident of Guilford, CT, for thirty-two years, died at Yale-New Haven Hospital on February 14, 2013. The cause was multi-system failure. He was born on August 18, 1929, in Lake Forest, Illinois, the son of Phelps and Mary Cotton Kelley. He attended Deerfield Academy and, afterward, served a year in the Army. He entered Yale College and graduated with a B.A. in 1953. While at Yale, he was a member of the secret society Book and Snake. Following a year with Price Waterhouse in Chicago, he enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he received his M.A. in 1956 and his Ph.D. in 1961. He was a Lecturer in History at Illinois Institute of Technology 1956-57. He was an Instructor at Yale 1961-64, Assistant Professor, 1964-67, Curator of Historical Manuscripts and University Archivist, 1964-66. He was, variously, Lecturer, Research Associate, and Research Affiliate at Yale from 1967 to 2007. He was the author of ""Yale, A History,"" published by the Yale University Press in 1974 and reissued in paperback in 1998. Also in 1974 the New Haven Preservation Trust published his brief study, ""New Haven Heritage: An Area of Historic Houses on Hillhouse Avenue and Trumbull Street."" He was co-author with Daniel J. Boorstin of the much-lauded high school textbook, ""A History of the United States,"" published first (1980) by Ginn and Company and subsequently by Pearson-Prentice Hall. It went through many editions, most recently in 2007 as part of a new series called Prentice Hall Classics. He was also editor, with Boorstin, of ""Perspectives; Readings on American History in the 20th Century"" (1992). He served as historical consultant to the television series ""Freedom to Speak,"" based on the ideas and course of Yale history professor Rollin G. Osterweis, hosted by William F. Buckley, Jr., and produced by WQED/Pittsburgh in 1983. He was also a consultant in Modern European History for ""The Random House Dictionary of the English Language,"" second edition, unabridged, 1987. In 1956, he married Jean Russell. That marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his sister, Cynthia K. McGrath, his wife of 32 years, Suzanne Gray, and by his sons John Hutchinson (Bonny) and Todd Russell, and by his stepchildren, John and Elizabeth Burbank, and five grandchildren. He was predeceased by his brother, Phelps Cotton, and his son Brooks Russell Kelley. He served on the boards and as an officer of a number of nonprofit organizations: The New Haven Colony Historical Society (now Museum), The New Haven Preservation Trust, ISIS, The Foote School, and Connecticut Fund for the Environment. He loved to travel and with Suzanne visited all the continents and a large number of countries.

2013-03-06T00:00:00Z,"A municipal court in Prague on Tuesday acquitted the lead singer of the heavy metal band Lamb of God of causing a teenage fan’s death at a concert in the Czech Republic, The Associated Press reported. A court spokeswoman, Marketa Puci, said that the court had ruled that what Mr. Blythe did was not a crime and that the concert organizers were to blame for the incident.
 
The singer, Randy Blythe, 42, was charged in December with causing bodily harm to another person with lethal consequences. He stood accused of pushing a 19-year-old man from the stage during a 2010 concert at Prague’s Abaton club. The man later died of a head injury. Mr. Blythe pleaded not guilty, saying the fan’s death was an accident that had happened in a confused scuffle after several fans broke through barricades and rushed the stage. The singer had faced five years in prison if convicted; prosecutors said they would appeal the verdict."

Now, with “The Art of Cooking with Vegetables” (Frances Lincoln, $29.95), he offers 100 vegetable-centric recipes, many of them original and inventive, and all illustrated with his own collages. Consider eggplant with a suave onion curry purée, a pumpkin soup green with herbs, and ratatouille with cooked and raw vegetables, illustrated at right. A number of dishes are monochromatic, like purple carrots with purple basil or beets with red onions. A dessert soufflé is made with avocado and chocolate. The recipes are clear and mostly easy to follow, though some ingredients, like white tomatoes, might require a trip to Rungis, not Union Square."

2013-03-07T00:00:00Z,"KELLEY--Brooks Mather, 83, a resident of Guilford, CT, for thirty-two years, died at Yale-New Haven Hospital on February 14, 2013. The cause was multi-system failure. He was born on August 18, 1929, in Lake Forest, Illinois, the son of Phelps and Mary Cotton Kelley. He attended Deerfield Academy and, afterward, served a year in the Army. He entered Yale College and graduated with a B.A. in 1953. While at Yale, he was a member of the secret society Book and Snake. Following a year with Price Waterhouse in Chicago, he enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he received his M.A. in 1956 and his Ph.D. in 1961. He was a Lecturer in History at Illinois Institute of Technology 1956-57. He was an Instructor at Yale 1961-64, Assistant Professor, 1964-67, Curator of Historical Manuscripts and University Archivist, 1964-66. He was, variously, Lecturer, Research Associate, and Research Affiliate at Yale from 1967 to 2007. He was the author of ""Yale, A History,"" published by the Yale University Press in 1974 and reissued in paperback in 1998. Also in 1974 the New Haven Preservation Trust published his brief study, ""New Haven Heritage: An Area of Historic Houses on Hillhouse Avenue and Trumbull Street."" He was co-author with Daniel J. Boorstin of the much-lauded high school textbook, ""A History of the United States,"" published first (1980) by Ginn and Company and subsequently by Pearson-Prentice Hall. It went through many editions, most recently in 2007 as part of a new series called Prentice Hall Classics. He was also editor, with Boorstin, of ""Perspectives; Readings on American History in the 20th Century"" (1992). He served as historical consultant to the television series ""Freedom to Speak,"" based on the ideas and course of Yale history professor Rollin G. Osterweis, hosted by William F. Buckley, Jr., and produced by WQED/Pittsburgh in 1983. He was also a consultant in Modern European History for ""The Random House Dictionary of the English Language,"" second edition, unabridged, 1987. In 1956, he married Jean Russell. That marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his sister, Cynthia K. McGrath, his wife of 32 years, Suzanne Gray, and by his sons John Hutchinson (Bonny) and Todd Russell, and by his stepchildren, John and Elizabeth Burbank, and five grandchildren. He was predeceased by his brother, Phelps Cotton, and his son Brooks Russell Kelley. He served on the boards and as an officer of a number of nonprofit organizations: The New Haven Colony Historical Society (now Museum), The New Haven Preservation Trust, ISIS, The Foote School, and Connecticut Fund for the Environment. He loved to travel and with Suzanne visited all the continents and a large number of countries. Among his favorite journeys was traveling from Vladivostok to Moscow by private train just after the collapse of the Soviet Union and voyaging, also by train, from Beijing to Moscow following the route of the old Silk Road much of the way. Two of their trips took them around the world. He also loved to sail and skied into his 80's, active as he liked to say in nine different decades. There will be a memorial reception for Brooks held at the Graduate Club at 155 Elm Street in New Haven on March 9 at 2pm. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Connecticut Fund for the Environment, 142 Temple Street, 3rd floor, New Haven, CT 06510 or to The Kelley Memorial Fund at the Community Foundation for Greater New Haven, 70 Audubon Street, New Haven, CT 06510."

Mr. Sprouse’s resignation, which came on Tuesday, followed weeks of growing consternation by some fans and retailers after the announcement from DC in early February that included Mr. Card among the creative teams. In a statement provided by DC Comics, Mr. Sprouse said: “It took a lot of thought to come to this conclusion, but I’ve decided to step back as the artist on this story. The media surrounding this story reached the point where it took away from the actual work, and that’s something I wasn’t comfortable with.”"

Irving was born in 1921, a first-generation American born to immigrant parents from the Ukraine. He grew up in Brooklyn speaking Yiddish as his first language. Irving became a member of what came to be known as ""The Greatest Generation"". He graduated from the City University of New York as a certified public accountant and then served in the Army Air Force during World War II. As a navigator on a B-17 plane, he flew 34 missions over Germany with the 839th Squadron. Upon returning to the United States, he graduated from Columbia Law School on the G.I. Bill. He married Dorothy Benjamin in 1948. He worked for J.K. Lasser and William Casey and then started his own company, Panel Publishers, producing books and journals that addressed developments in both tax and pension laws. He was also a professor of business at C.W. Post University. An ardent baseball fan, he cheered for the Brooklyn Dodgers and then the Mets, but never for the Yankees. A voracious reader, short story writer, avid crossword and Scrabble player, dabbling artist and loving father and grandfather, he will be very much missed by his wife, Dorothy, his children, Jay, Susan and Fran; his son-in-law and daughter-in-law, John and Linda, and his six grandchildren, Aaron, Martin, Rose, Will, Alana and Julie."

2013-03-08T00:00:00Z,"LARDI--Dr. Elizabeth (""Betty) Coryllos Dr. Elizabeth (""Betty"") Coryllos Lardi, died on March 6th, 2013 at her home in Old Brookville, NY at the age of 83, surrounded by her family and beloved dog, Niko. This extraordinary woman lived an anything but ordinary life. Born in New York City in 1929, as the only child of renowned thoracic surgeon, Dr. Polivius Coryllos and Lois Ralli Coryllos, she often said she considered being a veterinarian but, when advised that a woman could only work on small animals, decided to become a surgeon. To her, the words doctor and surgeon were synonymous; her father had always told her that to be a surgeon was to be a doctor with an added tool. After graduation from the Spence School in New York, Elizabeth studied pre-med at Barnard College where she graduated cum laude in 1949. She was a runner in the Greek Games, a college auctioneer, active in Physical Education and President of the combined Barnard-Columbia Pre-Med club. In 1953, she was one of two females to graduate from Cornell Medical School. The next step was an internship in Medicine and Pathology at the Cornell division at Bellevue, then a five year surgical residency, including one year as a New York Heart fellow, for which she earned her masters degree in Surgery and, as Senior Resident in General Surgery, helped set up the first heart-lung machine at NYU. In 1959, Elizabeth set off to Toronto where, as not only an American but the only female, she completed her Pediatric Surgery fellowship at the Hospital for Sick Children where she felt blessed to find wonderful people who rapidly made her feel welcomed. Upon returning to ""her island"", Manhattan, she began practicing pediatric surgery. She helped start the New York Society for Pediatric Surgery and her new home became New York Medical School-Metropolitan Medical Center where her first of many projects was to set up the new Department of Pediatric Surgery while holding the rank of Assistant Professor and Junior Attending on the Thoracic-Cardiovascular service, teaching 3rd and 4th year med students and surgery residents, and serving a term as President of the Hellenic Medical Society. In 1963, Elizabeth married attorney Paul F. Lardi. They began their life together in a one bedroom apartment over a garage on a Great Neck estate with their two adopted police horses and ultimately two babies. After moving to their current home in 1965, they had two more children and many more animals. It was during this time that Elizabeth went into private practice on Long Island and joined North Shore, Mercy and Meadowbrook hospitals where she was chief of Pediatric Surgery for many years. In 1965, she joined the staffs of Glen Cove and Nassau Hospitals, now Winthrop University Hospital. She later became Chief of Pediatric Surgery at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffolk and was made Chairman of the New York State Injury Prevention Committee. Amongst the many accomplishments Elizabeth achieved professionally were her involvement in Pediatric Sports Medicine since its beginnings in the 1960's; the separation of Siamese twins in 1978, being named ""Man of the Year"" by the Lion's club in Glen Head, becoming active in the Advanced Trauma Life Support program as a State Faculty Member. She helped introduce the use of hypnosis combined with local anesthesia as an alternative for patients needing surgery who are medically contraindicated for general anesthesia. More recently, her work concentrated in the Breast Feeding program at Winthrop through which she became internationally known as one of the leading sources for lactation therapy. Elizabeth constantly sought to increase awareness of and treatment for children with osteogenesis Imperfecta. In 2001 she received the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Teaching Attending Award for Pediatrics from Winthrop University hospital. In 2002 she was honored with the Distinguished Service Award by the Nassau Surgical Society and in 2003 the State of New York honored her for her ""50 Years in Practice"". The list of Elizabeth's diplomas, certificates, awards, associations and memberships goes on. She was a uniquely gifted surgeon who sought to heal not only the child that was her patient, but also their families. She was a strong and confident 5 foot 3 inch tall woman who carried a gift from God in both her hands and her heart; her mission in life was to share those gifts with as many people as she could. As a mother, Elizabeth treated every child in the way she would hope another doctor would treat her own. Elizabeth lived her personal life as passionately as her professional life. She and her family indulged their love of farming and outdoors with a small Angus farm. She will always be remembered for her desire to save everything from a human life to a shriveled up plant; her love of gardening and adventure, and her will to make a difference. She was a daughter, wife, mother, grandmother, cousin, friend, role model, a reason to believe that nothing is impossible, a symbol of hope and encouragement, and so much more. She lived her life to help others and have a great time in the process. Whenever cautioned that a planned new challenge would overtax her capacities, Elizabeth would quote her idol, Joan of Arc, and say, ""I'm not afraid, I was born to do this"". Elizabeth is survived by her husband, Paul, and all four children and seven grandchildren; Lisa (Sergio Echeverria), Paul (Laiz; Nina, Chloe), Janice (Steve Ross; Will, Cole, Luke), and Gordon (Shana; Jaden, Ava). Visitation will take place at the Whitting Funeral Home, 300 Glen Cove Ave, Glen Head, NY 11545, on Sunday, March 10, from 2pm through 9pm. www.whitting.com. Funeral services will be held on Monday, March 11at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Resurrection, 1400 Cedar Swamp Road, Brookville, NY. at 10am.

Resident of Jupiter, FL, died peacefully at home in Greenwich, CT after a courageous year and a half long battle against an aggressive brain tumor. He is survived by his beloved wife, E. Galey Clarke, his children Marian Weaver Ide of Natick, MA, S. Davis Weaver of Cape Cod, MA, Timothy Weaver of Bolton, MA, Jen Weaver Trisk of Greenwich, CT, his brother William Bigler Weaver III of Colts Neck, NJ, his sister Alita Weaver Reed of Hobe Sound, FL and eight grandchildren. Samuel D. Weaver was the second child of William Bigler Weaver Jr. of Charlestown, WV and Alita Davis Weaver of St. Louis, MO. He was predeceased by his younger brother E. Whitaker Weaver of Greenwich, CT. Sam was an alumnus of Greenwich Country Day School, Middlesex School in Concord, MA and Williams College, Class 1961. He maintained many loyal friendships with classmates throughout his life. He was a fierce competitor and will be remembered for his athletic achievements in basketball and baseball at both Middlesex and Williams. Following a successful career in banking at the Wall Street firm of Morgan Guarantee, he became a private investor. He was the ""go to"" person for friends, family and associates with questions about finance. Among the many committees that Sam served on over the years, the one closest to his heart was the Grindstone Association of Winter Harbor, ME. He served as Chairman of the Golf Committee for twenty years and was instrumental in improving one of the oldest golf courses in the United States. Sam was caring and reliable; a man without pretense. Whether at the Round Hill Club, the Winter Harbor Yacht Club, or Admiral's Cove, you could count on Sam for a good story. He was always ready to laugh, tease or pull a prank, but try as he might, he couldn't prevent the twinkle in his eye or the twitching at the end of his nose from giving away his joking. Sam will be buried alongside his mother, father and brother at the Putnam Cemetery. Services are private."

Mr. Merians passed away peacefully at his home in Alpine, New Jersey. Mr. Merians first joined Talon as president of the company in 1981. At the time, a New York Times report quoted ""the owner of another zipper company"" who ""applauded"" the move, saying, ""Talon needs a street fighter."" He went on to acquire Talon in a leveraged buyout in 1984, an early example of such an acquisition. He ran the company until he retired. Mr. Merians had a long history as a high-level executive in the textile industry. Prior to Talon, Mr. Merians served as president of Everlon Fabrics, a division of Nabisco that manufactured curtains. He joined Everlon in 1963 after rising through the ranks as a sales executive and division manager at Garan, Inc, and before that at Uxbridge Worsted Co. Sidney Merians was born in Harlem, New York on December 11, 1926, the child of Russian Jewish immigrants. His father, a furrier, introduced Merians to the textile business, employing him in his small company, which was relocated several times during the Depression-first to Pennsylvania, and later to New Jersey, where Sidney Merians attended Paterson High School. Mr. Merians enlisted in the Army Air Corps at the age of 17 and served in the Pacific during World War II. Upon his return, he attended Clemson University on the G.I. Bill, and earned a B.S. in textile engineering. While at Clemson, he met Isabel Bern. The two eloped in 1952, and subsequently moved to New York before settling in Alpine, NJ where they lived for 42 years, and where Mr. Merians was elected to the town council, serving the town for over a decade. After his retirement from Talon, Mr. Merians served as a consultant to, and sat on the boards of, Ivy Asset Management, a financial management service, and Paxar Corp., a clothing label maker. In addition, Mr. Merians was an active supporter of several charities, including UJA, Jewish Family Services, and Englewood Hospital. He was also a director of the United Jewish Appeal, a member of American Arbitration Association, and was the president of the Alpine Country Club, where he also served on the board of directors. In addition to his wife, Isabel, Mr. Merians leaves behind three daughters, Lisa DiSalvo, Melanie Merians, and Valerie Merians, and two granddaughters, Madeleine and Rachel DiSalvo, a step-granddaughter, Sara DiSalvo and three sons-in-law Joseph DiSalvo, William Guston and Dennis Johnson.

2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"When a team is about to play its first game of the season, and the owner publicly states that anything less than a trip to the Eastern Conference finals would be a disappointment, pressure is created that is hard to live up to. For the Brooklyn Nets, who invested heavily in putting together a winning team in their first season since their move from New Jersey, the pressure created by the team’s owner Mikhail Prokhorov has seemingly distracted from what has otherwise been a successful move for both the Nets and Brooklyn.
 
In a sense, for anyone to talk about this season as a disappointment for the Nets is to ignore their recent history. Currently in line to be the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference, the Nets will almost assuredly make the playoffs for the first time since 2006-7, which was the last time the team finished with a .500 record. After years of being among the worst in the N.B.A. in home attendance, the Nets have filled 94.8 percent the Barclays Center’s seats on average for a total attendance of 583,228 through Friday."

2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"It must feel a bit surreal to find yourself, in the tradition of once-unknown European actors like Javier Bardem and Jean Dujardin, suddenly an American sensation. Just ask Matthias Schoenaerts, who starred last fall in the French art-house hit “ Rust and Bone ,” in which he plays Ali, a single father and mixed-martial-arts fighter who falls into a careless romance with Stéphanie, played by a deglamorized Marion Cotillard, who has recently become a double amputee after being maimed by one of the whales she trained at a SeaWorld-type park on the Côte d’Azur. Schoenaerts’s performance, suffused with a clumsy gentleness that recalls Ryan Gosling’s career-changing role in “Half Nelson,” has earned him critical raves and media infatuation. One day he’s a working actor living in Belgium, finding time to go to the gym; the next he’s a Hollywood man of the moment, with a string of movies on the docket.
 
“It’s been exciting, but at some point it drives me nuts,” Schoenaerts says. Indeed, he feels that his quiet life in Antwerp — where he lives with his girlfriend, a law student and model — is slipping away. “I haven’t been here a lot this year,” he says. “Next year I want to do two projects and not more. Four or five a year starts feeling like a grab-the-money-and-run show.”"

2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"It’s pretty neat to be the first act with an album out on a brand-new record label, but even more momentous when that label — in this case, Cult Records — is run by Julian Casablancas, of the Strokes. While lead singer Donald Cumming isn’t shying away from whatever halo effect that may cast on the Virgins ‘ “Strike Gently,” which will be released March 12, mostly he’s excited to have the blessing of a fellow musician who understands both sides of the mixing board. “We all played the songs in the studio together,” Cumming said of the band. “You can really hear our instruments bleeding over each other.” The organic quality here lies in considerable contrast to the Virgins’ self-titled 2008 debut, whose rock ‘n’ roll was produced to within inches of bubble-gum pop on tracks like “Rich Girls” and “One Week of Danger.” Their new material is stripped down, a harmonic rumble of moonlight swagger and blue-rose tattoos. “I never aspired to hear someone sing my lyrics on ‘American Idol,’” Cumming explained. “I just wanted to make music that felt authentic to me.” Indeed, a lot has changed in the intervening five years: Cumming is the only original member left in the group; he’s married now, to the artist Aurel Schmidt; and he even taught himself to play the piano (think Schroeder from Peanuts, but with a Brechtian twist). “I don’t like to practice too much,” he admitted. “I like the discoveries I make to sound fresh.”

Not his 34 points. I think of Flynn, the Syracuse guard, stumbling a few steps as if his backside were magnetized to the nearest elevated surface, and sitting on the press table to catch his breath. The horn had just ended the fifth overtime. He looked at several reporters, shook his head and said, “This is crazy.”"
2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"Armory Arts Week is winding down, but Asia Week, New York City’s annual festival of Asian-art-theme shows, auctions and lectures, is just getting started. Joining new museum exhibitions like “Edo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints” at the Japan Society ( japansociety.org ) and “The Artful Recluse: Painting, Poetry and Politics in 17th-Century China” at Asia Society ( asiasociety.org ) is a minifair at the Ukrainian Institute of America, “JADA 2013” ( jada-ny.org ), hosted by the Japanese Art Dealers Association and opening on Friday.
 
The fair will include a themed exhibition on art of the Momoyama Period (1573-1615), emphatically titled “Momoyama Style!” Momoyama art really had two styles; the opulence of castles belonging to the daimyo, or feudal lords, furnished with golden decorative objects and extravagant textiles, and the more rustic, wabi-sabi aesthetic seen in the tea ceremony."
2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"In 2010, when the Issue Project Room, a presenter of new music, wanted to show off its new space in the former Education Department building at 110 Livingston Street in Downtown Brooklyn, it made a splash with a performance of Morton Feldman’s six-hour String Quartet No. 2 . Last August, though, Issue Project had to shutter the space because of structural problems. On Saturday it reopens there with another monumental work: “November” by Dennis Johnson, a California composer cited as a forerunner of Minimalism by that movement’s éminence grise, La Monte Young. Johnson fashioned “November” from a handful of achingly slow-moving melodic figures, producing a six-hour span of soft-spoken intensity. Lost for more than 50 years, “November” was recently reconstructed by the composer Kyle Gann, and recorded in a limpid five-hour interpretation by the pianist R. Andrew Lee, who will play the work next Saturday. (2 p.m., 718-330-0313, issueprojectroom.org .)"

2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"Over the last several decades, it has become accepted wisdom that consuming saturated fat, the type found in meat and butter, is bad for you. Starting in the 1960s, studies showed convincingly that saturated fat raises cholesterol levels and that these elevated levels, especially of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL (the so-called bad cholesterol), increase heart disease. Studies also showed that consuming polyunsaturated fats — safflower, corn and soybean oils — reduced people’s levels of overall cholesterol and LDL and should be encouraged.
 
But new studies may be upending those assumptions. Researchers with the National Institutes of Health and other organizations recently resurrected the results of a long-overlooked Australian study conducted from 1966 to 1973, in which one group of men with heart disease increased omega-6-rich polyunsaturated fat intake to 15 percent of calories, while reducing saturated fat intake to less than 10 percent. Another group of men with heart disease continued their normal diets."

2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"FEFFER--Gerald Alan ""Jerry"". A preeminent trial lawyer who attained nationwide recognition as one of the leading criminal tax defense attorneys in America, died at his home in Washington, D.C. on February 13. He was 70. Jerry Feffer epitomized the term ""Super Lawyer,"" according to James Bruton, a criminal defense lawyer who worked closely with Mr. Feffer throughout the last 30 years of his legal career, first at the U.S. Department of Justice and then at the Washington, D.C. power firms, Steptoe & Johnson and Williams & Connolly. ""He had an uncanny rapport with juries. It is one thing to have a jury acquit your client, but quite another for jurors to wait around after they have been discharged to hug the defendant and wish him well. That's the kind of reaction jurors had to a Feffer defense."" Jerry's uncanny rapport did not stop with the jury but extended even to his adversaries. As Brendon Sullivan, his partner and close colleague at Williams & Connolly put it, ""Jerry was, simply put, the nicest man we knew. He was able to be a zealous advocate, yet remain a gentleman. He could try a hard-fought case and still be friends with the opposition."" His friends and business associates unhesitatingly attribute his ability to get along with jurors and the prosecution as well as everyone else with whom he came in contact to his infectious smile, his boundless enthusiasm, and his genuine compassion for others. ""Jerry was something rare in our profession,"" said Roger Zuckerman, a Washington, D.C. lawyer. ""He remained a uniformly nice and kind person, gentle, with an easy and ever-present smile. He was the antithesis of what most people think about lawyers."" Jerry was born in Washington, D.C. in 1942. As a boy he spent most of his time playing or watching sports of all kinds, which would become his life-long passion. He and his pals regularly would spend 25 cents to take a streetcar to Griffith Stadium after grade school, where they would sneak into the stadium to see his beloved Senators. At age 14 he moved to Europe when his father, a U.S. Diplomat, was assigned there. He attended school at Aiglon College (Chesieres, Switzerland) and Notre Dame International School (Rome), and then returned to the United States to enroll in college at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where he graduated with honors in 1964. He studied law at the University of Virginia Law School, graduating in 1967. After law school Jerry joined the Wall Street law firm of Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander & Mitchell. In 1971 he left to serve at the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, first as an Assistant U.S. Attorney and later as Assistant Chief of the Criminal Division. He reentered private practice in 1976 with New York City's most prestigious criminal defense law firm, Kostelanetz & Ritholz, where he practiced for three years before being appointed by President Jimmy Carter as Assistant Deputy Attorney General of the Tax Division of the Department of Justice in charge of criminal tax investigations. He left the Department of Justice in 1981 with the end of the Carter Administration. Preferring to remain in Washington, D.C., he then joined Steptoe & Johnson as a partner, leaving in 1976 to become a partner at the quintessential white-collar criminal law firm in America, Williams & Connolly. While there, Jerry worked exclusively with lawyers who shared his love for white-collar criminal law, including the legendary Edward Bennett Williams, the undisputed dean of the field. This move was the fulfillment of his professional dream, which he realized on his very first day when he got on the elevator with Mr. Williams and Mr. Williams introduced him to Joe DiMaggio, Jerry's favorite hero after Willie Mays. Jerry became one the country's most sought after white-collar criminal defense lawyers early on in his career. He and his clients counted his greatest successes by cases that were never made public rather than those that were. His goal in every instance was to persuade the government not to prosecute his client, if not during the investigation then at least once indicted. It was his rare case that progressed to actual trial. Nonetheless, Jerry also was the consummate trial lawyer, with legendary cross-examination skills. One of his more celebrated trials was his defense of hotelier Leona Helmsley against federal income tax evasion and extortion charges. His ""silver tongued"" arguments, as the prosecutor characterized them, won an acquittal on the most serious charge, to the surprise of legal experts around the country. After the trial the jury foreman was quoted as saying ""Mrs. Helmsley had the best lawyer on the planet. He was a cross between Jimmy Stewart and Steve Martin."" Jerry's compassion for others resulted in many years of community service, mostly involving education. In the early 1990s he was active in Mentors, Inc., a Washington, D.C. high school mentoring program, and he later served on the Boards of Directors of two local private schools, first at Beauvoir School (as Chairman) and then at The Field School (as Vice-Chair). In 2004 Jerry was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, an illness that in his case started slowly but eventually progressed rapidly, forcing him to retire from the practice of law in 2010. At that time he volunteered to serve on the Board of Directors of the Parkinson's Foundation for the National Capitol Area. ""He made an incredible impact on our program,"" said Lou Nistler, Executive Director of the Foundation during Jerry's years of service. ""His personal commitment was key in helping us grow to become the largest Parkinson's Chapter in the country. He was a true inspiration to all of us."" Jerry Feffer led a fulfilling life full of love, family, friends and adventure. His wife, Monique Edwige Yingling; three sons, Andrew, John and Keith Carl ""Casey""; two sisters, Emily and Myra; daughter-in-law Susan and grandchildren Jake and Rees; and beloved aunt, Rosalie Kane, survive him. A Memorial Celebration of Jerry's life will be held at The Field School in Washington, D.C. on April 27, 2013 at 10:30am. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Jerry's name to the Parkinson's Foundation of the National Capitol Area, 7700 Leesburg Pike, Suite 208, Falls Church, VA 22043."

2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"TREZISE--Maria Lucia Bezerra Dayton. Born on July 12, 1929 in the upstate Sao Paulo city of Barretos, Maria Lucia became known as ""Puzas"" (to the chagrin of her mother, Ilnah Lima Bezerra) from the nickname bestowed by her father, Dr. Francisco de Assis Bezerra. Puzas completed her post-graduate studies at the Faculdade de Psicologia Sedes Sapientiae in Sao Paulo where she worked with abandoned children. In 1960 she moved to Rio de Janeiro as an auditor with the Brazilian Ministry of Finance, returning to Sao Paulo in 1966 when she married Arthur Dayton Trezise of St. Albans, New York who had been transferred to Brazil by his employer, the American Can Company. The couple raised three children in Sao Paulo where they attended American schools. Upon her retirement, Puzas accompanied her husband in his second career as a United States Foreign Service officer in their assignments to Sao Paulo, Bogota and Paris. With her knowledge of Spanish and French, combined with her warm personality, Puzas counseled single mothers on a regular basis in a religious shelter in Bogota -- putting to good use her life-long dedication to children. She ably complemented her husband in his responsibilities as Commercial Counselor of the American Embassy in France. Since 1994 the couple resided in both Vermont and Sao Paulo. Puzas the 11th among 12 siblings -- leaves her sisters, Silvia Camara and Neusa Reiff, plus a beloved team of 36 nieces and nephews in Brazil, in addition to her husband Arthur and their children: Bridie Bezerra Musser (Steven) with grandsons Will and Ben of Minneapolis; Arthur A. B. Trezise (Heather) with grandchildren Clara, Macy and Wyatt of Gunnison; and Patrick Bezerra Trezise (Silvia) of Sant Cugat del Valles, Spain. There will be a Requium Mass at 11am on March 14 at St. Peter's Church in Gunnison for family and friends in the area, with similar funeral services to be announced at a later date in Sao Paulo and Vermont."

Every view of wildlife on this trip filled me with excitement because I was sharing it with my wife, who grew up on a farm in Guangdong, China. She had seen animals in the zoo in Guangzhou, but I told her it would be amazing to see them free on the plains of Africa. We traveled to Tanzania as a prelude to a new adventure — having our first child, we hoped — on our return.  These zebras were taking a break from the great migration when I snapped this photo, which captured the essence of wild Africa for us.

2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"Insomnia is never far from my thoughts, especially when I am writing. A poor sleeper even as a girl, I spent many nights scribbling diary entries in a notebook on the bathroom floor after our household had gone to bed. As a mother with a full-time job, I often sought the desk in the wee hours by necessity. Those liminal hours between dark and dawn continue to haunt my praxis even now that my nest is empty. For me, there is nothing as attuned as nocturnal writing.
 
We who suffer from sleeplessness also have an arsenal of advice to offer one another. After I once confessed in an article to being a “mouth-breather and ferocious snorer,” concerned readers urged me to seek medical attention, certain that some sort of breathing issue was causing my inability to get a good night’s rest."

A renowned thoracic surgeon and pioneer in his field, he was also an artist, inventor, public servant, mentor and entrepreneur. He was an individual who was committed to enhancing the lives of others. He was born on January 15, 1929 to Louis and Hortense (Ardengo) Del Guercio and grew up in Larchmont where he lived all of his life. Dr. Del Guercio graduated from Fordham College in 1948 with a B.S. degree, cum laude.

At the Albert Einstein College of Medicine from 1960- 1971 he progressed from Instructor of Surgery to Professor. He then served as Chief of Surgery at the Saint Barnabas Medical Center in New Jersey until 1976 when he was appointed Chairman of Surgery at New York Medical College and Chief of Surgery at Westchester Medical Center where he served for 26 years until his retirement. He was the author of three textbooks and 320 surgical articles. He was one of the founders and past presidents of the Society of Critical Care Medicine.

2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"Debates over the fairness of the tax code are as old as the federal income tax itself. A cornerstone of the tax — established a century ago, by the 16th Amendment — has been the principle that those who make more should pay more, while lower tax rates help the poor support their families and depend less on government benefits. 
 
That social compact shifted into high gear during the Nixon administration, which tried to incentivize work by rewarding low-income households with a tax break that became the nation’s most successful antipoverty tool ever: the earned-income tax credit. Politicians of both parties have embraced the credit, making it more progressive three times since it was enacted in 1975."

2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"In her brief tenure on earth, 28-year-old Lauren Bush Lauren has already occupied many roles in the public sphere: presidential niece, model, wife of David Lauren, fashion designer, social entrepreneur, philanthropist — and now, photographer. Her latest venture with FEED Projects — her six-year-old company that sells utilitarian-chic, grain-sack-inspired bags and donates school meals to the world’s hungry children with each sale — is the FEED function bag, available now on the company’s Web site. It’s a messenger-like iteration of FEED’s familiar burlap theme, with a detachable shoulder strap, a faux suede bottom and an interior outfitted with pockets for today’s many gadgets. To promote it, Bush Lauren, who minored in photography in college, has shot portraits of a smattering of her many creative (and busy) friends, among them the photographer Henry Hargreaves (above), the Town and Country editor Amanda Hearst and Lehmann Maupin ’s Carla Camacho, all pictured carrying the bag. “We wanted to show real people that I am inspired by, and how they function,” Bush Lauren says of the project, which can be viewed on FEED’s Web site. “Instead of hiring a photographer, I thought: I would love to do this.”
 
So will photographer be a permanent addition to her already overstuffed résumé? The portrait project is over for now, but Bush Lauren is enthusiastic about contributing her snaps to FEED’s lifestyle blog, and about doing similar projects in the future. “It’s fun to flex that photography muscle again,” she says. “It’s something I haven’t used nearly as much as I would have liked.”"
2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"The 1970s have always been a nebulous time for style, particularly interior design. An era — or was it a moment between two eras? — full of brazen promise at the beginning, but to which the harsh light of passing years has not always been kind. Especially when it comes to modernism. Picture conversation pits, exposed reel-to-reel stereo equipment or George Hamilton in a leather vest, shirtless. Of course, there are also the highlights, like Babe Paley in a caftan, or the town house rebuilt for Halston on 63rd Street by Paul Rudolph, snapshots of a moment whose fabulousness is undimmed.
 
Another highlight of 1970s design, though not so well remembered today, is the work of the designer Ward Bennett, who died in 2003 at the age of 85. Ask for the book on Bennett and you will find none. Ask one of his clients about him, however, and you will hear raves, assertions of loyalty and of his importance as a designer. There’s a real sense of affection for the man who started out as a shipping clerk in Manhattan’s garment district and ended up creating objects, jewelry, furniture and houses that are of their time, but also have a quiet elegance that evades classification. In a world in which “important” design is increasingly taken to mean Mies chairs and Noguchi lamps, Bennett was and is one of the in-between guys who has not been reduced to Design Within Reach catalog status. “He was one of the first people to look at industrialized modernism as a source of sensual design,” the architecture critic Paul Goldberger says. Indeed, Bennett makes the ’70s look good."

2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"Born in Vietnam and raised in Denmark, the conceptualist Danh Vo’s rapid rise in the art world can be attributed to his incisive and enigmatic style. His most famous work to date involved “building” a to-scale model of the Statue of Liberty: the hundreds of discrete chunks were never actually assembled into a whole; instead they were scattered around the globe to represent the reach of democracy and American imperialism. Last year, Vo won the Guggenheim’s prestigious Hugo Boss Prize , a biennial award that comes with a solo show at the museum. Continuing his exploration of identity and heritage, Vo has filled his show, which opens on March 15, with artwork, kitschy Americana (above right) and Oriental knickknacks that belonged to the late painter Martin Wong . “I consider it a kind of collaboration,” he says. “And I don’t have any problems collaborating with dead people.”
 
Another of Vo’s exhibitions, which opens on March 20 at Marian Goodman Gallery , cleverly assembles the personal effects of Robert McNamara , the former secretary of defense. Largely remembered for escalating the American involvement in the Vietnam War, McNamara is a fraught figure for the artist, whose family fled their homeland in a boat when he was 4 years old. But McNamara is also an ideal subject for Vo, who is once again deconstructing a complex symbol of American power."

Sunny, stormy and fog-drenched Tangier has long been a magnet for diplomats, painters, traders, writers, dreamers, stoners, smugglers and spies. In the last century, the city has been full- and part-time home to an eccentric assortment of creative residents and travelers including Eugène Delacroix, Henri Matisse, Edith Wharton, Tennessee Williams, Paul Bowles, Barbara Hutton, Cecil Beaton, William S. Burroughs, Patricia Highsmith and Yves Saint Laurent. All of them basked in the warm — sometimes dangerous and decadent — romantic allure of Morocco’s most northern outpost. The city’s complicated, contentious history matches its diverse vistas and uneven topography: it has been an ancient Berber settlement, a Roman and Phoenician outpost, and a trophy port for a half dozen occupying foreign powers before it gained independence in 1956."

2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"MERIANS--Sidney, Former owner and CEO of Talon, Inc., the world's oldest manufacturer of zippers, died Wednesday, March 6, at the age of 86. Mr. Merians passed away peacefully at his home in Alpine, New Jersey. Mr. Merians first joined Talon as president of the company in 1981. At the time, a New York Times report quoted ""the owner of another zipper company"" who ""applauded"" the move, saying, ""Talon needs a street fighter."" He went on to acquire Talon in a leveraged buyout in 1984, an early example of such an acquisition. He ran the company until he retired. Mr. Merians had a long history as a high-level executive in the textile industry. Prior to Talon, Mr. Merians served as president of Everlon Fabrics, a division of Nabisco that manufactured curtains. He joined Everlon in 1963 after rising through the ranks as a sales executive and division manager at Garan, Inc, and before that at Uxbridge Worsted Co. Sidney Merians was born in Harlem, New York on December 11, 1926, the child of Russian Jewish immigrants. His father, a furrier, introduced Merians to the textile business, employing him in his small company, which was relocated several times during the Depression-first to Pennsylvania, and later to New Jersey, where Sidney Merians attended Paterson High School. Mr. Merians enlisted in the Army Air Corps at the age of 17 and served in the Pacific during World War II. Upon his return, he attended Clemson University on the G.I. Bill, and earned a B.S. in textile engineering. While at Clemson, he met Isabel Bern. The two eloped in 1952, and subsequently moved to New York before settling in Alpine, NJ where they lived for 42 years, and where Mr. Merians was elected to the town council, serving the town for over a decade. After his retirement from Talon, Mr. Merians served as a consultant to, and sat on the boards of, Ivy Asset Management, a financial management service, and Paxar Corp., a clothing label maker. In addition, Mr. Merians was an active supporter of several charities, including UJA, Jewish Family Services, and Englewood Hospital. He was also a director of the United Jewish Appeal, a member of American Arbitration Association, and was the president of the Alpine Country Club, where he also served on the board of directors. In addition to his wife, Isabel, Mr. Merians leaves behind three daughters, Lisa DiSalvo, Melanie Merians, and Valerie Merians, and two granddaughters, Madeleine and Rachel DiSalvo, a step-granddaughter, Sara DiSalvo and three sons-in-law Joseph DiSalvo, William Guston and Dennis Johnson.

Of his paintings, Roberta Smith wrote in The New York Times last March: “The best of them, made from 1946 to 1970, are initially unimposing yet can rivet the eye with their roiled surfaces, saturated colors and combinations of odd symbols or distilled evocations of the natural world.” People can see for themselves, starting April 19, at the Menil Collection in Houston with “Forrest Bess: Seeing Things Invisible,” featuring about 40 paintings, including, right, “Drawings” (1957), an oil on canvas ( menil.org )."

You hope to score in one of these categories. Sometimes you’re lucky enough to find a place with two. Three is unimaginable. 
 
We got location and cost. Our place was a hot pretzel’s throw from Central Park and close enough to the American Museum of Natural History that I often detoured there after school to do my homework beneath their giant blue whale. Also, it was cheap: my mother had moved there in the 1970s, and rent-control had kept it affordable. But it wasn’t big. My parents slept on the living room futon, and my bed was all about storage: under, over and inside (layering fitted sheets, one on top of the other, saved room in the closet)."

In the late 1930s, the Women’s Printing Society, in London, published a slim book with a curious title: “Life-Spark Stories for the Intelligent Young.” Attributed to the author “R. K.,” it tells the story of a “bright little Life-Spark living in the heart of the great Lord-King of the Sun,” who comes down to earth and embarks on a series of adventures. The Life-Spark meets Mother Earth, Nurse Destiny and other deities; it changes form, inhabiting various plants and animals — a pansy, a dog named Gipsie, a little boy. The book is an unusual literary hybrid, an illustrated children’s story and an occult tract: “Harold and the Purple Crayon” meets Aleister Crowley . To be precise, it’s a work of theosophy, offering lessons in karma, reincarnation and other precepts of that esoteric spiritual movement to its intelligent young readers."

A founding father of the New York punk scene, Hell is often credited with establishing, along with the sound, the style of the movement. In his new memoir, “ I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp ” (Ecco, $26), he gives a candid, sometimes brutal tour of punk’s gritty early days: he dissects band dynamics, counts notches on his bedpost, relates his disturbing descent into addiction and debunks myths about his famously choppy hair. It’s like a testosterone-fueled “Just Kids.” Below, a few of the book’s juiciest bits.

2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"The Dutch designer Sebastian Brajkovic deconstructs the historical elements of his tables, chairs and lamps while giving them a surreal, extruded quality that is only possible with high-tech machinery. He was barely out of school when pieces from his Lathe furniture series began to appear at design fairs and in the collections of major museums. The furniture, inspired by Brajkovic’s childhood interest in things that turned, like reel-to-reel tape decks, is the subject of an exhibition that opens on March 18 on the European campus of the Savannah College of Art and Design in Lacoste, France. Several of his pieces are available for purchase through the Carpenters Workshop Gallery in London and Paris."
2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"Here comes another play with an asterisk in its title, but not for the usual reasons. The * in “The (*) Inn,” which opens on Monday at the Abrons Arts Center, isn’t a substitute for an obscenity. This is a production of the Target Margin Theater, a brave experimental troupe that would never be coy about a curse word. Instead the asterisk fills in for “haunted,” which is how the adjective in “Die Puste Kreshme,” by Peretz Hirschbein, is usually rendered in English.
 
But for David Herskovits, Target Margin’s feverishly inventive director, “haunted” is too restrictive to describe what happens in this seldom-seen classic of the early 20th century, part of the company’s “Beyond the Pale” season of Yiddish theater. Hirschbein melded symbolist and naturalist modes for his tale of love under siege in a tradition-bound shtetl. “In a way the writing begins in the 1890s, slides into the 1920s, appears to settle into a mid-20th-century existential landscape and lands finally right here today,” Mr. Herskovits said. Expect the play, which features the downtown favorite David Greenspan, to be worthy of several asterisks. (Through March 30, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, 212-598-0400, abronsartscenter.org ; $25.)"
2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"The British establishment is a notoriously tough guard to crack —particularly for the wave of oligarchs who have been making London their home. So how come Evgeny Lebedev makes it look so easy?

 
In the novels of Balzac, it often happens that a provincial writer, poor but brilliant, comes to Paris, where he talks his way into critical success. In the stories of Henry James, this outsider is often an American girl who charms her way into European society. Anthony Trollope created “foreign-born” fin­an­ciers who bulldozed their way into the Vic­torian establishment too."

STRONG SUPPORT The lockout did not alienate fans. Instead, they came back in droves, as they did after the N.B.A. lockout in 2011. Television viewership so far is up from last season’s overall figures in the United States. NBC reported a 37 percent jump in viewers for N.H.L. telecasts on its main network and a 34 percent rise on cable. In Canada, TSN’s Wednesday telecast leaped 30 percent compared with last season’s overall figure and CBC’s early Saturday game is up 16 percent from this point last year."

Adam Brown, the British designer behind the culty swimwear brand Orlebar Brown , offers a corrective. His classic trunks — trimly tailored with a fixed waist and adjustable side tabs — come in three decreasingly daring lengths: the thigh-exposing Setter, as modeled by Daniel Craig in the most recent Bond flick (here in the new-for-spring Fiorentina print by the late designer David Hicks); the midlength Bulldog, for shyer sorts; and the Dane, a slimmed-down board short that marries Old World prudery with a New World fit."

With his lanky 6-foot-5 frame and sleeves of 1920s-era tattoos, Ben Gorham doesn’t look like your average perfumer. In fact, when the former professional basketball player first presented his fragrances in Paris seven years ago, a French journalist sniffed, “What gives you the right to do perfumes?” Gorham, whose Byredo line now has a devoted following that generates $30 million in global sales, smiles as he recalls that early snub: “I was a wild card. But I’m very competitive. I can do one thing really obsessively.”"
2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"For those wanting to own a piece of American pop art history without the million-dollar commitment, 1stdibs is selling original Andy Warhol photographs online next Wednesday starting at 11 a.m. Though photography was not the artist’s main focus — he mostly used the snapshots as a basis for his drawings, portraits, prints and famous silkscreen paintings that sell for $6 million to $100 million — his Polaroids, 8×10 black-and-white photographs and photo booth strips are one of a kind and have, in some instances, influenced his most famous works.
 
“If you’re a new, burgeoning collector who wants to own his or her first Warhol, this is the most inexpensive and highest-value entry point into collecting Warhol,” says Jim Hedges, the New York-based retired investment banker who has spent the past decade collecting the photographs featuring everyone from Giorgio Armani and Steven Spielberg to Diana Vreeland and Truman Capote. With this sale, Hedges is sharing his exclusive access with anyone with an Internet connection and anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 to spend on the “unique objects” that he likens to “Picasso’s sketchpad or Matisse’s paintbrush.” As Hedges explains, “When Andy made a painting, those works always started with a photograph. That photograph would be copied and turned into the screenprint that Warhol used to make the painting. So this is the way he sketched.”"
2013-03-10T00:00:00Z,"Pam Grier “can discuss philosophy in one scene and hit somebody with a bar stool in the next,” her “Foxy Brown” director, Jack Hill, once said. With “ Foxy, the Complete Pam Grier ,” a Film Society of Lincoln Center program running Friday through next Sunday, Ms. Grier’s potent action aura is on abundant display. She worked as a switchboard operator for American International Pictures before appearing in prison films like “The Big Bird Cage” (1972) and “Black Mama, White Mama” (1973). The urban one-two punch of Mr. Hill’s “Coffy” (1973) and “Foxy Brown” (1974) firmly established her credentials as a no-nonsense embodiment of female empowerment. 
 
Other films followed — including “Greased Lightning” from 1977 (opposite her future boyfriend Richard Pryor as an early black stock car racer) and “Escape From L.A.” from 1996 — directed by, among others, Jane Campion and Tim Burton. And then there was the title role in “Jackie Brown” (1997), Quentin Tarantino’s assured adaptation of Elmore Leonard’s “Rum Punch” and a fitting valentine to one of his all-time muses. Ms. Grier is appearing at several screenings to discuss her career. (Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center, 144 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; 212-875-5601, filmlinc.com .)"

Her theme song is Mr. Herman’s live-for-the-moment anthem “It’s Today.” Ms. Maye may be turning 85 in April, but she has more voice and stamina than most singers half her age. Although many of the songs in her new show, “Maye-den Voyage,” are numbers she has performed before, nothing sounded stale on Wednesday.

That strong result represents one of the biggest March debuts ever. Still, the weeks ahead remain crucial: “Oz the Great and Powerful” cost an estimated $325 million to make and market and will need to continue selling tickets at a sizzling pace to turn into the kind of financial juggernaut that Walt Disney Studios wanted. Disney had hoped for another “Alice in Wonderland,” which sold more than $116 million in tickets on its opening weekend in March 2010 and ultimately took in about $1 billion worldwide. “Oz” is clearly no “Alice.” But a hit is a hit; Disney’s live-action label has struggled of late, and “Oz” indicates a turnaround may finally be taking hold."

He was 96. Mr. Constable, known as Cheston to his friends and family, was a native of Baltimore who lived for many years in Greenwich, Ct., while working as an advertising and communications executive with the IBM Corp. in Manhattan and Armonk, N.Y. An avid sailor and tennis player, he spent many summers on Nantucket Island and was a member of the Nantucket Yacht Club. Known as a dapper dresser and dignified figure who enlivened social occasions well into his 90s, Mr. Constable was the last surviving member of his generation in a prominent Baltimore family. A son of attorney William Pepper Constable and the former Hyla Amanda Webb, he attended the Calvert School and Gilman Country School, graduated from The Tome School in 1935, and received a B.A. from Brown in 1939. He was a competitive track runner in high school and college, and a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. From 1942 to 1945, Mr. Constable served as a captain in the U.S. army, commanding a paratrooper training unit in the U.S. and Central Europe, and he later served as an officer in the U.S. army reserve. After the war's end he moved to Manhattan, where he met and married Priscilla, a noted fashion designer with the Henri Bendel company. She survives him, along with their son, Timothy C. Constable, a computer consultant in Watertown, Ma.; their daughter, Pamela G. Constable, a journalist and author in Arlington, Va.; and two granddaughters.

Jenkins, who spent the last two of his nine seasons in the N.F.L. with the Eagles, was cut last month in a salary-cap move. He drew a lot of interest around the league, reportedly meeting with the 49ers, Seahawks and Raiders all last week before deciding on a shorter move and signing with the Giants. The entire Eagles defense struggled last season and Jenkins finished with only 26 total tackles and four sacks, but in 2011, he had 40 tackles and 5.5 sacks. He is primarily a run-stuffing interior lineman who can also help a pass rush. He was an anchor of the Packers’ defense when Green Bay won the Super Bowl after the 2010 season."

Most patients were nonviolent, 26.4 percent were involved in minor violence, and 11.8 percent in violent acts using weapons or resulting in injury.

2013-03-12T00:00:00Z,"GLEN RIDGE, N.J. – Mark Sanchez threw four interceptions in a must-win December game at Tennessee. He committed 26 turnovers overall, and for the second straight season. He was also benched twice. But it seems increasingly apparent that Sanchez will begin training camp as the Jets’ starting quarterback, regardless of how the team addresses the position through free agency and the draft, or in a potential trade.
 
Sanchez “probably will have just a little bit of a leg up, it would appear,” said new offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg, who stressed the importance of competition – without knowing, of course, who will be competing with Sanchez. The Jets’ financial commitment to Sanchez — $8.25 million guaranteed – in 2013 made it almost certain that he would remain with the Jets in some capacity."

2013-03-12T00:00:00Z,"A cloud has long hung over the intriguing thesis that resveratrol , a minor ingredient of red wine, activates cellular proteins known as sirtuins that promote longer life in laboratory worms, flies and mice.
 
Critics have suggested that there were errors in the original experiments and that resveratrol did not in fact activate sirtuins directly. If so, resveratrol would lose much of its scientific interest because its link to the sirtuin would be unclear. But a new study led by David Sinclair of the Harvard Medical School, who in 2003 was a discoverer of resveratrol’s role in activating sirtuins, found that resveratrol did indeed influence sirtuin directly, though in a more complicated way than previously thought. Resveratrol appears to work by changing the shape of the sirtuin proteins in a cell. Thus activated, the sirtuins do several things, one of which is to switch on a second protein that spurs production of the mitochondria, which provide the cell’s energy. This would explain why mice treated with resveratrol ran twice as far on a treadmill before collapsing from exhaustion as untreated mice."

While there have been several movie versions of “The Great Gatsby” (including the 1974 film that starred Robert Redford, Sam Waterston and Mia Farrow), this one from Mr. Luhrmann (the director of “Romeo + Juliet” and “Moulin Rouge!”) is surely the first to be presented in 3-D, old sport."

Though her expertise is on display at Eolo, her two-year-old restaurant in Chelsea, it’s at Pastai, her compact new restaurant nearby, that the pasta takes over. Pastai, which is due to open on Monday, is a pasta factory for both restaurants, and it has a retail counter. There are at least 10 types of fresh pasta available at any time, including a rich whole-wheat gemelli, curly strands of spinach reginette, busiate made by twisting dough on knitting needles and pasta grattata (similar to spaetzle). She is meticulous about keeping the production of her gluten-free varieties, like butternut squash ravioli, separate from wheat. You can watch the pasta being made at the counter, which is decorated with her collection of vintage rolling pins: 186 Ninth Avenue (21st Street), (646) 688-3463, pastainyc.com .

2013-03-13T00:00:00Z,"MUSHER--Hadassah K.,widow of Sidney Musher, mother of the late Jeremy (Evi), Daniel (Karol), and David (Ruth), and last surviving daughter of Rabbi Mordecai and Lena Kaplan, died at her home on March 8, soon after celebrating her 101st birthday with her children, nine grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren. In the fall of 1911, Henrietta Szold held parlor meetings in the Kaplan's home to form an organization to provide medical support in Palestine. The decision to call this organization Hadassah was made in December, 1911, and, when the Kaplan's new daughter was born in January, 1912, she, too, was named Hadassah. Educated in the New York public schools and Hunter College, Hadassah became a teacher. During the Depression, she was asked to continue at half-salary so that male teachers could receive a full salary, whereupon she resigned and went to travel in Palestine. She visited archaeological sites in Egypt and Jordan, riding into Petra on donkey and to the pyramids and the temples at Thebes and Luxor on camelback. Hadassah played a leadership role in many cultural and philanthropic organizations. As head of the Women's Division of the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, at her father's 70th birthday, she had Eleanor Roosevelt speak to promote the egalitarian goals of Reconstructionism. She served on the boards of the Reconstructionist Foundation and later the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. When Sidney became head of the PEF-Israel Endowment Fund, Hadassah traveled with him several times each year to oversee grants to various social, cultural and educational charities. These visits led to her involvement in the Batsheva Dance Company, Ben Gurion University, Hebrew University, Israel Sinfonietta, and the Weizmann Institute, among others. She was also active in the PEF Israel Endowment Fund, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, the America Israel Cultural Foundation, and numerous cultural organizations in New York. Remembered for her energy, vitality, devotion to family, and commitment to education and culture, Hadassah will be sorely missed by family and friends."

It will be the seventh American debut of a Churchill play at New York Theater Workshop, where her previous plays included “A Number” and “Far Away” as well as “Seven Jewish Children,” which drew complaints in both London and New York for its portrayal of some Israelis, who speak savagely about Palestinians. James MacDonald will direct “Love and Information,” as he did last year in a London production. The play, which features dozens of short scenes about characters overwhelmed by the nonstop pace of modern information, is expected to begin performances in early 2014.
 
The workshop’s season will include another new work, Will Power’s “Fetch Clay, Make Man,” about the improbable friendship between a young Muhammad Ali and the Hollywood actor Stepin Fetchit, to be directed by Des McAnuff. The play had its premiere in 2010 at the McCarter Theater Center in Princeton, though Mr. Power has substantially rewritten the script since then, Richard Kornberg, a spokesman for New York Theater Workshop, said. The McCarter production of “Fetch Clay” starred the Tony Award winner Ben Vereen as Stepin Fetchit and Evan Parke as Mr. Ali; asked if those actors would reprise their roles, Mr. Kornberg would only say that casting was not ready to be announced.

The business argument for a spinoff is typically that a separation of the assets allows both the former parent and the newly independent company to be better run, freeing management to take bolder steps with the new company. And because Wall Street is a place where magic works, the market will recognize this, giving each of the separated companies a higher price."

2013-03-13T00:00:00Z,"Oysters, seaweed, lemon and a touch of radish bitterness: for me, this recipe by the chef Andrew Carmellini (the subject of a new profile by Jeff Gordinier ) calls out for manzanilla, the fino sherry that comes from the seaside town of Sanlúcar de Barrameda. One of the joys of the sherry renaissance is seeing its role expanded from aperitif to a wine to be enjoyed throughout a meal. Longtime sherry enthusiasts know how beautifully manzanilla goes with raw oysters. Its silken strength and saline flavors will pair just as well with the other elements of this baked dish.
 
Other options would be a savagnin from the Jura, especially those made sous-voile, under a veil of yeast, which share some of fino’s flavor profile. If this seems too esoteric, many dry, crisp, savory white wines will do just as well: Chablis, Sancerre, Muscadet, Fiano d’Avellino, ribolla gialla, just to name a few."

Here are some of them. A few have been condensed slightly. 

 
This is one time when common sense won out. Yes, too much sugar is bad, but the law was dumb. Anyone who wanted more soda could just refill their cup, especially in all those fast-food restaurants with self-service soda machines, which is most of them. The law also created a maze of rules and applied only to specific places serving specific kinds of choices, but not the choice to drink as much soda or have as much sugar as you wanted. — Carmela Sanford, Niagara Falls, N.Y."

The total audience — up about 65 percent from the second season — makes the third season of “Downton” the most popular drama ever televised by PBS. The show’s online viewership was counted separately. But there, too, a record was set: the public broadcaster said there were 900,000 video streams on the “Masterpiece” Web site the day after the Season 3 finale, the most for the site."

In David Tanis’s recipe for halibut skewers with yogurt sauce , the dominant flavors will be the Turkish spices, along with the lemon, onion and cooling herbs. 
 
I suggest a good sauvignon blanc, which can show a spectrum of herbal and citrus flavors. What sort of sauvignon blanc? One that is intense but not flamboyant or brassy, in which the flavors are more herbal than tropical fruit, with substance to match the richness imparted by the yogurt. My ideal would be one of the Italian cult producers — yes, cult sauvignon blanc — like Miani (very expensive) or Meroi (less so). But those are very hard to find. A California bottle might work well, though you must choose carefully to avoid oaky wines."

No, this isn’t a new episode of “True Blood.” It’s a translation of a century-old Yiddish play about shtetl life, “The (*) Inn,” that the adventurous Target Margin Theater has revived to mixed results. The director, David Herskovits , stymies any expectations of stodgy melodrama, which is apt because Peretz Hirschbein’s tempestuous drama has enough kinks, forbidden romance and hints of the supernatural to fill an HBO time slot. But in straining for a modern, lively update, Mr. Herskovits has staged a show that is more bold than coherent."

2013-03-21T00:00:00Z,"The performers of DanceBrazil, as seen this week at the Joyce Theater, exist in a ravishing, hard-working paradise. They’re barefoot; their attire (T-shirts, loose trousers, light dresses or skirts) has no hint of luxury. What matters here above all is the gorgeously full physicality of movement, allied to music. While spines continually plunge beneath the level of the waist, legs kick explosively above it or maintain powerful extensions like searchlights. 
 
Their world looks idyllic because the eight men and two women appear deeply sensuous yet show little hint of eroticism. The two sexes share the stage without tension. At one point in the second half of the program seven men, crouching, gaze at two women who’ve just entered. The situation is provocative, charged by flirtatious potential. When the women leave, the men erupt in a happy frenzy — and yet it’s as if the women are no longer on their minds."

2013-03-22T00:00:00Z,"STEVENS--Rise. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of mezzo-soprano Rise Stevens, a consummate artist, treasured colleague, and devoted supporter of the company for 75 years. She sang 337 performances with the company, including 124 of her greatest role, the title character in Carmen. Critics and audiences praised her plush vocalism and riveting acting in the role, which she sang at the Met and on tour with the company between 1945 and 1961. She made her company debut on tour in Philadelphia in 1938 singing Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier, a peerless interpretation of a role she would perform 74 times, a company record. Later that year, she made an acclaimed house debut in the title role of Mignon. Among her cherished roles with the company were Dalila in Samson et Dalila, Cherubino in Le Nozze di Figaro, Orfeo in Orfeo ed Euridice, and Hansel in Hansel and Gretel. After her retirement from the stage, Stevens continued her work with the Met as a tireless advocate for both the company and for opera as an art form, serving as director of the Metropolitan Opera National Company and of the National Council Auditions, advisor to the Young Artist Development Program, and a managing director on the Met's board. We extend our sincerest condolences to her son and daughter-in-law, Nicolas and Marguerite Surovy; her granddaughter, Marisa; and her many friends and admirers.

Schacter, University Professor of Jewish History and Jewish Thought, and Senior Scholar at Yeshiva University's Center for the Jewish Future, (and Yocheved) Schacter, and Miriam (and Rabbi Benjamin) Schacter Gampel, and an adored grandfather and great grandfather.

Prior to joining the synagogue, Rabbi Herschel Schacter was a US Army Chaplain who participated in the liberation of Buchenwald Concentration Camp and played an important role in helping the resettlement of Displaced Persons after the Holocaust. He enjoyed national prominence as a brilliant and inspiring orator and was Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish organizations and held many other significant leadership positions. His last professional role was as the Morris and Gertrude Bienenfeld Director of Rabbinic Services at the Community Service Division of RIETS. Beloved by congregants, Holocaust survivors and colleagues in the rabbinate, he will be sorely missed.

Alex had a long affiliation with Toastmasters, was a scuba diving enthusiast and was proud of his ping-pong game. Alex knew how to have fun. He was a warm, witty, gentle and happy man with a ready sense of humor and a twinkle in his eye. He enjoyed music and theater, and could often be found hiking in the woods or swimming in his favorite Stillwater Lake. Most of all, Alex loved his family, and together with Ruth, maintained a circle of devoted friends. He was a true inspiration to all who were fortunate enough to know him, and remains dearly loved by all. In memory of Alex, donations can be made to the National Kidney Foundation."

2013-03-23T00:00:00Z,"FRIEDMAN--Robert G.,of Ft. Lauderdale, FL, and formerly of Tiffin, OH, passed away peacefully in his home, surrounded by his loving family, including his wife of nearly 65 years, Eugenie S. Friedman; granddaughter of Oscar F. Mayer, and their five children, on Monday, March 18, 2013. Bob recently celebrated his 90th birthday, and would have celebrated his 65th wedding anniversary on May 1. Bob Friedman was born on February 6, 1923, to Genevieve (Jane) Mahank and John H. Friedman in Tiffin, OH. He was preceded in death by his sisters, Betty Jane and Rosalie Friedman, and Janie Congdon Stall. Bob was the leader of his own ten-piece jazz band, ""The Melodiers,"" while at Tiffin Columbian High School. Bob attended Case Western Reserve University where he was inducted into The Engineering Honor Society, Tau Beta Pi. Following his graduation from Case with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and attendance at Harvard Business School, Bob served as a Naval Officer aboard the Battleship Texas during World War II. After the war, Bob rose through the ranks of The National Machinery Company (National) in Tiffin, OH and became the President and Chief Executive Officer for almost three decades. During his tenure, National became not only the largest employer in Tiffin, but also the largest global manufacturer of hot and cold forging and forming machinery, capturing 52% of the world market. In 1958, Bob led the acquisition of J.G. Kayser Company in Nuremberg, Germany, establishing manufacturing and distribution for National in Europe. He also negotiated contracts with the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War, Fiat Motor Company in Italy, and Pratt & Whitney. Bob invented and received a patent for the first machine to stamp a seamless aluminum can as well as for the manufacture of the blades and buckets for jet engines. Under his leadership, National achieved widespread industry recognition and success as an early pioneer of profit-sharing, employee stock ownership and productivity bonus programs. During the past 43 years he maintained a deep and abiding love for those who had worked with him. Following his work at National the family relocated to Ft. Lauderdale, FL where stock portfolio analysis and management were his passion. Bob became the founding investor and served for over twenty years as Chairman of the Board of Direct Supply, Inc., the nation's largest supplier to the long term care industry. Bob also pursued composition of music and lyrics for over 100 songs which were performed or arranged by jazz greats including Joe Williams, Ray Brown, Louie Belson, Lou Rawls, Benny Carter, Ernestine Anderson, Marian McPartland, Carmen McRae, Billy May, Matty Matlock, Flip Phillips, Johnny Mercer and Quincy Jones, with many of whom he also developed lasting friendships. Joe Williams performed Bob's songs on ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,"" and Quincy Jones included one of Bob's songs, ""A Tribute to Benny Carter,"" in his ""Best of Quincy Jones"" album. His music has been performed by the Milwaukee and Jacksonville Symphonies and also by the award-winning University of Miami Jazz Band. He was inducted into the Big Band Hall of Fame in Palm Beach, FL in 1992. Bob was most proud of his first song for his wife, ""Serenade to Genie,"" and the five songs he wrote for each of his children, ""Betty,"" ""Jenny,"" ""Mary,"" ""Jane"" and ""Bobby. Bob and Genie believed themselves to have been blessed, and that with these successes came both the privilege and the obligation to share. Through The Robert G. Friedman Foundation, Bob and Genie shared their blessings with many, including the Institute for Civic Involvement at Pine Crest School, Holy Cross Hospital, Smith College, Northwestern University and Curious Kids Museum. Bob was first and foremost a devoted husband; father and friend, whose loyalty and love were unsurpassed. Says his son, Robert T. Friedman, ""My Dad's many accomplishments are an inspiration to us all and his most enduring gift is the love he gave so freely and deeply to our family."" Bob Friedman is survived by his wife, Eugenie Steuer Friedman, and his children, Robert Taft Friedman of Chicago, IL, Elizabeth (Daniel) O'Connor of Fort Lauderdale, FL, Jennifer (Robert) Hillis of Milwaukee, WI, Mary (Douglas) Baske of Fort Lauderdale, FL, and Jane (Robert) Anspach of Perrysburg, OH; fifteen grandchildren (Eugenie (Kahlil) O'Connor, Elizabeth (Chris) Elsbury, Danny (Solidea) O'Connor, Catherine (Sean) Hough, Genevieve (Brian) Hillis, Bobby Hillis, Alison (Vance) Wiese, Adam (Abby) Baske, Emily (Fletcher) Reeves, Michael Anspach, Bobby Anspach, John Anspach, James Friedman, Will Friedman and Mary Friedman) and seven great-grandchildren (Jackson and Evelyn Reeves, Ava Wiese, Jack and Patrick Elsbury, Connor Hough and Elisa O'Connor). Bob Friedman's legacy is best summarized by his own words, as embodied in his song, ""God Bless You:"" God Bless You, with peace of mind. And help you see the thrill of being kind. God give you your faith again, And help you see the good in other men. And so will those who knew and loved him, will remember him. The family wishes to extend its love and eternal thanks to Dr. Joel Gellman for his extraordinary care of Bob. And to Marta Bosch, whose many years of friendship and devotion deserve the most heartfelt thanks. Finally, to all of Bob's wonderful caregivers, Rick Shaw, Elva Hodzic, Karen Wirkus, Antonia Antunez, Nuno Hodzic and Mark Alexander, the family extends its undying gratitude. Visitation will be at Fred Hunter Funeral Home, 718 South Federal Highway, on Sunday, March 24th from 4-6pm, with Funeral Mass to be held at St. Anthony's Church on Monday, March 25th at 10am. In lieu of flowers, donations can be sent to the American Cancer Society or the Gold Coast Jazz Society."
2013-03-23T00:00:00Z,"WUNSCH--Eric M. A creative powerhouse in the fields of engineering, alternative thinking and art collecting died at 88. Mr. Wunsch died peacefully in his home on Gramercy Park on March 20, 2013. Known as Martin to his friends, he initially applied his creativity license to mechanical engineering designing and building numerous materials-handling vehicles, such as deft, mobile cranes used by the military in World War II; electric fork lifts; capstans; and giant container handling devices with enormous capacities that helped expand the ports of America exponentially. During the last 40 years, he turned his interest to the arts. His personal and business collections of American furniture and old masters paintings are unparalleled in private American collecting. Just as importantly, he amassed a vast wealth of scholarship which led like-minded collectors and curators to join him in working to preserve America's art history. Born in Brooklyn on July 27, 1924, he graduated Poly Prep with great haste, going on to matriculate at MIT before his 17th birthday. With the ink on his Masters in Engineering barely dry, he joined the Army and was stationed in the Pacific Rim during WWII. Upon his return, he joined the Wunsch family business, Silent Hoist & Crane, creating unique mobile materials-handling equipment to solve engineering challenges by ""taking the load off a man's back"". He piloted his own plane on sales calls throughout the country and built the brand to a premier level in the industry. To those who knew him well Martin Wunsch was a loyal friend and a very special man who always had a smile, and an opinion. He will be missed. He is survived by his wife of 61 years Ethel, sister Rosa Durando, son Peter, daughter-in-law Susi, and his beloved grandsons Eric and Noah. A memorial service will be held 11:00am, Thursday, April 25th at Christies New York, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, in lieu of flowers the family requests a donation be made to Alzheimer's Association."

Since 2004, the N.F.L. has staged its season opener – along with concerts and other festivities – at the home of the Super Bowl champion, usually on the Thursday night before the first full weekend of the regular season. But on that night this year, Sept. 5, the Baltimore Orioles open a four-game series at home against the Chicago White Sox. Because the Ravens and the Orioles share some parking lots, their games cannot overlap. And because Sept. 4 is the start of Rosh Hashana, the N.F.L. decided it would not play that night."

Mr. Bennett, 86, and Lady Gaga, 26, recorded a duet of “The Lady Is a Tramp” for Mr. Bennett’s acclaimed “Duets II” album from 2011, which won a Grammy. That album served as a template for Mr. Bennett’s release “Viva Duets” last October, on which he collaborated with Latin American singers."

2013-03-23T00:00:00Z,"ARMSTRONG--Thomas (Tom), died on March 12 at his apartment in Manhattan. Death was attributed to Lymphoma. He was 81. He is survived by his wife Martha, daughter Melissa, son-in-law David, granddaughter Marcella, brother Ted and loyal pooch Louis. Tom graduated from Colgate University in 1952. Following a tour of duty in the army as a first lieutenant, he joined Grey Advertising holding positions that included running Grey's European operations out of London. Returning stateside, he moved from New York to Chicago to work with the advertising agency, J Walter Thompson. In October 1973, Tom made the jump to the client side, taking an executive position with Uncle Ben's Rice in Houston, Texas. He became president of this division of Mars, Incorporated and later was president of Mars' Kal Kan operations in Vernon, California. He retired from the Mars Corporation in 1992 after 19 years of service and he and Martha moved back to Houston. After a couple years out west, the couple decided to make New York City their permanent home and settled into an apartment on the east side. Tom was a big guy- 6'5"" and about 200 pounds (depending). He could whack a golf ball 300 yards- although he wouldn't necessarily be able to tell you where it landed. He was a lover of the arts and a devoted, generous supporter who served on the boards of the Houston Grand Opera and other organizations. He was a wizard in the kitchen, creating his own dishes that prompted long and sincere lip-smacking. Tom and Martha loved to travel and spent months each year in London and Rome (he spoke Italian molto bene). He loved New York City best, though: its theater, its opera, its restaurants, shops, parks and, especially, its streets. He felt that the best way to experience the city was on foot. This was no casual conviction. He'd sometimes walk 60 or 70 miles a week. And in cowboy boots, no less. In keeping with Tom's wishes, there will be no services. However, he would be happy if you'd remember him with a donation to the Harlem Children's Zone (www.hcz.org)."
2013-03-23T00:00:00Z,"The credit card site CardHub.com recently reviewed current zero-balance credit card transfer offers and found that many cards let consumers transfer all sorts of debt — not just credit card debt — onto the new cards.
 
The site’s founder Odysseas Papadimitriou , writing about the findings for The Christian Science Monitor, said several major card issuers let you transfer car loans to their credit cards — in effect, letting you trade secured debt (the car is collateral for the loan) for unsecured debt. Some cards have introductory zero interest rate periods of up to 18 months. If you use such transfers strategically,  he says, you can lower the rate on your car loan, saving as much as $1,000 in interest charges."
