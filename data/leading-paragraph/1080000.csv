1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"This compilation, designed to promote the finer influences of war, such virtueas patriotism, obedience, courage -- not the wild lust of battle -- consists of descriptions of many battles in many parts of the world. The present volume is concerned only with campaigns between 1816 and 1860."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"In a way this story combines the old plot of the waif who found his lost name with the more modern nature cult, but it takes most of its spirit from old-fashioned romance -- and is all the better for that. The hero is a little Irish boy lacking a hand, but all there in the matter of courage, cheerfulness, and freckles."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"You deserve the greatest praise for your splendid editorial on football this morning. It should be remembered that brutality is not manliness, but cowardice. There is hardly a great football game without some injury to one or more of the players, which frequently seriously disfigures or disables the young man for life, and sometimes proves fatal."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"If the sterner brand of Calvinism is no longer fashionable in cities, indeed finds existence almost impossible in such places, there are yet regions of the Canadian Northwest where a parson with the blood of the Covenanters in him is at a premium. This is the story of such a parson, by name Hamish MacGregor, called on account of his tow head, Shock."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"The theory suggested in these columns yesterday morning -- namely, that a weak closing on a Thursday would these days be followed by a rise and a strong finish on Friday worked out its salvation in practice yesterday. The market opened with some hesitancy, but, gathering strength as the hours passed on, closed with a small boon."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"With but a single dissenting vote the Board of Estimate went on record yesterday in favor of a municipal electric lighting plant, and Corporation Counsel Delany was directed to prepare an amendment to the charter carrying the necessary power, to be presented to the coming session of the Legislature."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"INTERESTING as have been all of Mr. Anthony Hope Hawkins's clever stories, and confidently as one always opens one of them when in search of forgetfulness of the daily grind of humdrum happenings and humdrum people, it seems certain that most of the readers of his ""Double Harness"" will open their eyes a little in surprise at the decided step forward on his part which it undoubtedly marks."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"Prof. A.H. Espenshade of the Pennsylvania State College has expanded his lecture notes into a volume called ""Essentials of Composition and Rhetoric,"" (Boston: D.C. Heath Co.) As a result he has produced a work valuable from a practical rather than a literary point of view; his explanations of the principles of composition we couched in terms plain to a high school pupil."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,""" Old Florence and Modern Tuscany,"" which will bear E.P. Dutton Co.'s imprint, is a sketch of the Tuscan peasants. The book may be thought by many to overestimate them, but the author, Janet Ross, has lived among them for thirty-four years, and she states that in no other country more than in Italy is the golden rule, ""Do as you would be done by,"" more carefully followed."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"It seems that the Japanese on ""203-Meter Hill"" are ""inexpugnable"" to Russian assaults. The desperation of the assaults by which the Russians have endeavored to retake this position corresponds to the desperation which the Japanese have shown in assaulting it. And quite naturally."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"Considerable ado was made in the Street yesterday over the announcement that the National City Bank had arranged to import $500,000 in gold from Paris. In some quarters the inference seemed to be drawn that the announcement meant that the exchange market had suddenly shifted from the gold-export to the gold-import point and that the engagement was probably the first of a series of such transactions."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"Paris is indeed the ideal city for the novelist, and Alexandre Dumas adored it. From the stones of Paris have been built up many a lordly volume. Francis Miltoun in his ""Duma's Paris"" has constructed a historical and topographical work abounding in reminiscences of the supreme maker of romances."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"This is a book of epigrams, a beautiful English girl, and brigands. The scene, as the title hints, is in Sicily -- the Sicily which, in spite of all the years between, is still in the author's eyes somewhat, in the pretty English girl's eyes altogether, the Sicily of Theocritus. However, you are to understand the girl-is-no-blue-stocking."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Sandys's book is one of a classification now somewhat numerous. He has interwoven a variety of information about fishing, hunting, and camping in the Northwest, with a sort of skeleton story. ""Sportsman Joe"" is a boy, the son of a New York stock broker, who has grown up rather thin and pale."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"To say that admirers of Stevenson will find the dress of this new ""Edinburgh"" worthy of the contents is to say much in little. A severely plain binding of dark blue buckram, with paper, print, and format all that a modest taste could wish for; the illustrations, drawings of corners of the old town and new by T. Hamilton Crawford. W.E. Lockhart, and Sam Bough -- sixteen of them, all charming."

1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"Mother Goose has been utilized as a basis for the making of a ""Folk-Lore Primer"" by Eulalle Osgood Grover. (Chicago: Atkinson, Menazer Grover; 30 cents.) The old-fashioned ""See the dog! It is a black dog. I do not fear dogs"" of our own school days is gone; the children of to-day are served with tales from their beloved Mother Goose."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Saturday, Dec. 3. -- The possibility of Russia trying to send her Black Sea fleet to the Far East strongly engages the attention of England, in view of the complications which would result if such an attempt were made."
1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,It would not surprise us to be informed that the writer of these essays stood in a pulpit every Sunday morning and that these essays are so many of his sermons that have been diminished of their texts. Conviction on these counts would work no corruption of their blood. If these were sermons in their first intent they were very different from the ordinary run of sermons.

1904-12-03T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Barrett Wendell's volume, ""The Temper of the Seventeenth Century in English Literature,"" is calculated, at least by its title, to arrest attention.
