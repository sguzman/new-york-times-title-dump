2009-03-15T00:00:00Z,"The Mugrabi family is a case study of not only what is wrong with the art world but also what is wrong with the moneyed classes in general (Eric Konigsberg, March 1). Instead of owning art for the enjoyment and aesthetic pleasure it brings, they see it as a market commodity to be manipulated to serve their own financial interests. Their habit of buying large quantities of art by designated artists and hoarding it, using their power as potential buyers to drive up prices paid by others, is repugnant. It’s this sort of selfish greed, from the subprime-mortgage market to the ponzi scheme of Bernard Madoff, that helped usher in our current global recession. Art can transform one’s interpretation and understanding of the world. The Mugrabis don’t seem to comprehend that."

(Ages 9 to 12) The story of L'Ouverture, who led a successful rebellion in the French slave colony of St. Domingue -- now Haiti -- is full of cruel reversals. An eloquent leader (John Adams was an admirer), L'Ouverture resisted unnecessary violence, but failed to build on his victory and died in a French prison. Rockwell succeeds admirably in explaining a complicated life, and the American-primitive-style drawings are a good match. But there is no simple or uplifting moral to the story of this tragic hero.

Building on this experience, she began a prolific period of song-writing. Credits from this period include Sesame Street, PBS's Punchinello, and NBC's Emmy-award-winning Unicorn Tales. She spent most of her professional career as a lyricist in the New York professional theater community. She was responsible for the lyrics and concept of Tallulah!, a musical about Tallulah Bankhead, which was presented off-Broadway. Mae also conceived and wrote the lyrics for the off-Broadway musical Cut the Ribbons, which explored the mother-daughter relationship. Her efforts were honored when the show was nominated for a MAC Award and an Outer Critic's Circle Award. Mae was a member of the Dramatists Guild, and served on many Boards and panels including Vice President and Board member of her favorite organization, the League of Professional Theatre Women, an organization to which she brought enormous personal dedication and energy.

He is survived by his wife, Jamie Raab, and their children, son Ian Dalrymple and daughter Lola Dalrymple. The cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage. In a forty year career in book publishing as a literary contracts expert, he consulted with hundreds of authors, publishers and literary agents. He worked with such companies as Avon Books, Dell Publishing and Harper and Row (now HarperCollins), and then joined Warner Books as Director of Contracts where he stayed for 17 years. There, he met his wife, Jamie Raab, who is currently Publisher of Grand Central Books (formerly Warner Books). He was born in Waterloo, Iowa to Dwight Marion Dalrymple and Willa (Bette) Rasche, and grew up in Sarasota, Florida, before moving to New York City. Dennis loved New York City with the passion of a transplant, living first in Greenwich Village and in recent years on the Upper West Side. Mr. Dalrymple was a longtime anti-war activist who never met a war he wasn't prepared to protest. He was a founding member of the Youth International Party, its members known as Yippies, formed in 1967 by leftists and cultural icons Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner to radicalize hippie youth to protest the Vietnam War.

''I grew up in Singapore, and one of the reasons I moved back there was simply because of the travel opportunities in Asia. There are so many cultures, such a rich history of those cultures, so many nuances: a Buddhist in Bhutan is different from a Buddhist from Thailand or Cambodia. We were at the monastic school when the dinner bell went off, and this flood of kids came out of their classrooms and down a hill, probably 100, 150 of them. I had set up the tripod at the bottom, to catch them coming down the footpath. But once they saw I was down there, they decided to run down the more treacherous way, and I captured them all in slow motion. When you show a digital image to kids from a place where they don't see that so often, they get really excited. But this time it was in slow motion, so I was bending time right there in front of them -- and they were ecstatic.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

Rebellious conservative Democrats whom Franklin Roosevelt tried unsuccessfully to purge effectively called a halt to the New Deal in 1938. Loyal Republicans voted for Ronald Reagan's budget in 1981 but joined Democrats in larding it with so much pork that it greatly expanded federal budget deficits.

Taking its lead from Mr. Marsalis, a saxophonist of obstinate candor, the band has become both looser and more imposingly self-assured. ''Metamorphosen,'' its new album, captures that dynamic almost perfectly."

Almost every category, led by the print media and business-to-business segments, was down. Local newspapers and Sunday supplements lost more than 10 percent each, and national newspapers had a 9.6 percent drop. Even Internet display advertising fell. Only two categories gained, partly at the expense of network television: cable TV, which rose 7.8 percent, and Hispanic cable TV, which led all categories with a 9.6 percent gain."
2009-03-16T00:00:00Z,"No sooner had President Obama lifted the Bush-era restrictions on financing embryonic stem cell research than critics began urging that any federal support be limited to work with stem cells derived from surplus embryos at fertility clinics. That would be a mistake. The guidelines should define the eligible research as broadly as possible to allow the greatest potential for advances. Some of the most important research requires stem cells genetically matched to patients with specific diseases, such as Parkinson's or diabetes. These can rarely be identified in the huge stock of surplus embryos."

A month after controversy over a production of ''Rent'' at a high school in Newport Beach, Calif., the comedian Steve Martin, left, has offered to pay for an off-campus production of one of his plays because its performance was banned by an Oregon school, The Associated Press reported. Parents at La Grande High School objected to what they called adult content in Mr. Martin's 1993 play, ''Picasso at the Lapin Agile,'' about an imagined meeting between Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso in a Paris bar. The school board halted rehearsals after receiving a petition signed by 137 people. In a letter published on Friday in The La Grande Observer, Mr. Martin offered to pay for the production because, he wrote, he wanted to keep the play ''from acquiring a reputation it does not deserve.''"

Instead, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it would press its 12 members to ''comply fully'' with earlier agreements to curb crude output.

2009-03-16T00:00:00Z,"RICHARD--Mae (nee Blank). Lyricist Mae Richard, a resident of Manhattan, died peacefully in her sleep on March 4, 2009, at the age of 86, although in spirit she was 39. She is survived by her loving husband of 66 years, Howard Richard, an attorney, and her two loving children, Larry and Barbara. She attended West Philadelphia High School, and earned a B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania. In mid-life, not content to remain a suburban housewife, she blazed new trails and ensconced herself in New York, determined to bring her immense creative talents to the world of musical theater. Her earliest successes came in the field of industrial theater, where she won accolades for musicals at DuPont, RCA, and Lehigh Valley Dairies. Building on this experience, she began a prolific period of song-writing. Credits from this period include Sesame Street, PBS's Punchinello, and NBC's Emmy-award-winning Unicorn Tales. She spent most of her professional career as a lyricist in the New York professional theater community. She was responsible for the lyrics and concept of Tallulah!, a musical about Tallulah Bankhead, which was presented off-Broadway. Mae also conceived and wrote the lyrics for the off-Broadway musical Cut the Ribbons, which explored the mother-daughter relationship. Her efforts were honored when the show was nominated for a MAC Award and an Outer Critic's Circle Award. Mae was a member of the Dramatists Guild, and served on many Boards and panels including Vice President and Board member of her favorite organization, the League of Professional Theatre Women, an organization to which she brought enormous personal dedication and energy. She also served as a member of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, awarding the Emmy Awards. At her death, she was working on an original musical based on a short story by Mark Twain.

Vikram Pandit, Citi's chief executive, boasted of $19 billion of revenues in the first two months of the year in a memo to his staff. Annualized, that would be $114 billion -- impressive given the state of financial markets and not far from 2007. That sparked the ''Pandit rally'' in the market.

The administration's sharp rebuke of the American International Group on Sunday for handing out $165 million in executive bonuses -- Lawrence H.

2009-03-16T00:00:00Z,"One way to make me happy is to show me a dance company in which everyone can turn to both the right and left. Dancers discover early that they pirouette more easily to one side or the other, and it's astonishing how many dull-minded companies indulge them by letting them turn only in the most comfortable direction. When you see a dancer who revolves both ways, it shows not just facility but control, even wit. And when you see a whole company turning both ways, you feel you're in a bright-minded climate. In the ''California Dreamin' '' section of Paul Taylor's ''Changes'' (2008), all the dancers do double pirouettes to the right and left. You hardly notice; an incidental feature, it's just one of many felicities in ''Changes'' and in the three-week season of Paul Taylor choreography that ended on Sunday at City Center."
2009-03-16T00:00:00Z,"My picks stem from three ideas: strong perimeter play, rebounding and the ability to make defensive adjustments. The first two are nearly equal in importance; the Pat Riley rule that rebounds equal rings has always resonated with me, and if you look at most recent N.C.A.A. champions, they tend to have very talented guards. You can win without a stellar center, but if your guards can't start your offense in crunch time, you're done. The exception to this would be teams with bigger players who can create their own shots from nearly anywhere, like Carmelo Anthony or Danny Manning. The ability to adjust defensively is a much fuzzier idea, since some teams are not tested enough during the season for one to know whether they possess this skill. In assessing relatively equal teams, the one that I know can switch to a zone or a trapping defense tends to get my pick. Learning on the job is not something I'm looking for in a tournament team. That's why, for example, I picked Louisville to advance to the Round of 8 last year in a bracket that included Oklahoma and Tennessee. But when it came to playing North Carolina for a Final Four bid, I felt that the Tar Heels had better rebounding and perimeter play than the Cardinals, outweighing Louisville's defensive agility."

That was a different age, of course. Congress was very much on board, supervising the reorganization of the bankrupt Northeastern railroads and then forming Conrail, in 1976, to run them. The auto companies, in contrast, are being pushed by the White House and Congress to reorganize themselves and remain private corporations, owned by shareholders."

Goodby, Silverstein, in a statement, attributed the decision to ''cost-cutting through a reduction of the number of agencies'' with which Anheuser-Busch InBev will work. Keith Levy, vice president for marketing at Anheuser-Busch, said cost-cutting ''wasn't the driving factor'' in the decision, attributing it to a ''strategic initiative'' to work with fewer agencies.

It is also an easy way to make money; a cybersquatter can impersonate the trademark's owner, sell ad space to the victim's competitors, or extort a payment in return for turning over the Web site. A recent report from MarkMonitor, a company that sells domain names to large companies and protects them from online misuse of their brands, suggests the practice is increasingly popular in the United States -- despite laws that allow trademark holders to sue. Over 2008, MarkMonitor tracked an 18 percent rise in incidence of cybersquatting, which it calculated by examining every new domain name created, checking for a trademark in the URL, and then seeing whether the trademark's owner also owned the Web site."

''Watchmen'' sold an estimated $18 million in tickets at North American theaters for a cumulative total of $86 million. Splashy, action-oriented movies geared toward a specific fan base typically do big business in their opening weekend and then fall off. But the drop for this picture was bigger than some analysts had predicted. Warner, however, remains hopeful. ''There's been a history of movies that take a big hit in the second weekend and then settle in and do just fine,'' said Dan Fellman, the studio's president for domestic distribution. ''Overall I like what I see.'' ''Race to Witch Mountain,'' starring Dwayne Johnson in a loose reboot of the 1970s-era Walt Disney Pictures franchise, sold $25 million in tickets. Third place went to the Universal Pictures horror remake ''The Last House on the Left,'' with $14.7 million in ticket sales.

But the real scandal is how long it took S.&P. to make that minor change -- and that the other major ratings firm, Moody's, still hasn't -- even though G.E.'s dividend has been slashed by two-thirds and its stock price had fallen below $7, from nearly $40 a year ago. Why, more than a year into the crisis, do regulators and investors continue to rely on ratings? No one has been more wrong than Moody's and S.&P. Less than a year ago both gave high ratings to 11 of the largest distressed financial institutions. They put the insurance giant A.I.G. in the AA category. They rated Lehman Brothers an A just a month before it collapsed. Until recently, the agencies maintained AAA ratings on thousands of nearly worthless subprime-related securities."

(Go to Men's Bracket) EAST VILLANOVA'S EARLY PATH IS CLEAR Look for Villanova to push Big East rival Pittsburgh. Duke should end its string of not reaching the Round of 16, helped by a home-crowd advantage in Greensboro, N.C. But if the Blue Devils end up playing Pitt, they'll get smashed, exploited by a lack of interior strength. Keep an eye on V.C.U., which has two future N.B.A. players. UPSET SPECIALScott K. Brown/Associated Press V.C.U. had been erratic all season but blitzed George Mason in the C.A.A. title game. Eric Maynor, pictured, a potential first-round N.B.A. draft pick, beat Duke with a jumper in the first round two years ago. Watch out for Larry Sanders, a 6-foot-10 condor in the mold of Keon Clark. No. 1 Pittsburgh vs. No. 16 East Tennessee State The Panthers shouldn't be seriously challenged until they reach Boston. No. 8 Oklahoma State vs. No. 9 Tennessee They're bonded by a primary color, orange, and generally uninspiring seasons. Pick the Vols, but don't watch. No. 5 Florida State vs. No. 12 Wisconsin The Seminoles will roll, the way their football team did against the Badgers in the Capital One Bowl. No. 4 Xavier vs. No. 13 Portland State For the Musketeers, a bad travel game (Boise) but a great matchup. The Vikings are seeded too high. No. 6 U.C.L.A. vs. No. 11 Virginia Commonwealth The Bruins have to fly across the country and then face a veteran team. Look for V.C.U. to win an ugly game. No. 3 Villanova vs. No. 14 American How was Villanova put in Philadelphia? This game is a red carpet to the next round. 'Nova will cruise to the Round of 16. No. 7 Texas vs. No. 10 Minnesota This is a lock for the Longhorns, who are much more talented. Look for the Big Ten to have a lousy tournament. No. 2 Duke vs. No. 15 Binghamton This will be close. Binghamton has elite athletes but not the size to exploit Duke's soft interior. SOUTH TOUGHEST ROUTE OF ALL This is the strongest region by a wide margin. It has star power with Blake Griffin of Oklahoma and Tyler Hansbrough of North Carolina and a hot team in Syracuse. Gonzaga's Austin Daye is a major N.B.A. prospect. And never count out Michigan Coach John Beilein. UPSET SPECIALDanny Johnston/Associated Press This is almost too easy. Illinois is over-seeded and its star guard, Chester Frazier, is hurt. Western Kentucky already beat Louisville this year and the combo guard A. J. Slaughter will emerge as a March hero. Steffphon Pettigrew, pictured, will also contribute. No. 1 North Carolina vs. No. 16 Radford Radford is the best of the No. 16 seeds, but that just makes it a slightly bigger speed bump. No. 8 L.S.U. vs. No. 9 Butler How bad is the SEC this year? Its regular-season champion is a No. 8 seed. Yikes. Go with L.S.U. in the toughest game to pick. No. 5 Illinois vs. No. 12 Western Kentucky Look for Big Red, W.K.U.'s mascot, to dance again. The Illini just aren't that good. No. 4 Gonzaga vs. No. 13 Akron Tough draw for Akron to be shipped to Portland. Expect the Zags to have a distinct home-court advantage. No. 6 Arizona State vs. No. 11 Temple James Harden is one of the few elite talents in this tournament. Temple might have left its legs in Atlantic City. No. 3 Syracuse vs. No. 14 Stephen F. Austin If Syracuse's legs are tired after working overtime after overtime in New York, they won't be tested here. No. 7 Clemson vs. No. 10 Michigan Reeling Clemson gets a nightmare draw. John Beilein is the hardest coach in the country to prepare to play. No. 2 Oklahoma vs. No. 15 Morgan State Todd Bozeman, banished for cheating at California, would need his old recruit Jason Kidd to win here. MIDWEST LOUISVILLE'S TO LOSE Looks like a cakewalk to Detroit for Louisville. Michigan State is a weak No. 2. The biggest test will probably come from Wake Forest, which is as talented as any team in the country. The difference: Louisville is filled with tested veterans, and Wake has erratic and inexperienced players. Defending champion Kansas has a bad draw. UPSET SPECIALHarry How/Getty Images On the basis of talent, Southern California is miles ahead of Boston College. DeMar DeRozan, pictured, scored 25 points in the Pac-10 title game and finally appears to be living up to his hype. Boston College is seeded way too high, too. No. 1 Louisville vs. No. 16 Alabama State/Morehead State This one will be a laugher, but playing Ohio State next in Dayton is no fun. No. 8 Ohio State vs. No. 9 Siena The Saints are better, and their N.C.A.A. experience last year will help. But did Siena's season earn it too high a seed? No. 5 Utah vs. No. 12 Arizona No team has played worse in the N.C.A.A. tournament than Arizona the last two years. Look for another stinker. No. 4 Wake Forest vs. No. 13 Cleveland St. The Vikings waited a generation to return to the N.C.A.A.'s and got a bad matchup. Wake, the best No. 4, should roll. No. 6 West Virginia vs. No. 11 Dayton The Flyers are strong and deep, but West Virginia is always tough. Look for the defensive-minded Mountaineers to win. No. 3 Kansas vs. No. 14 North Dakota State This is a road game for the Jayhawks, with Fargo 3 1/2 hours from Minneapolis. Kansas will win a close one. No. 7 Boston College vs. No. 10 U.S.C. These are two of the more puzzling and erratic teams. U.S.C. will win when its play finally mirrors its talent. No. 2 Michigan State vs. No. 15 Robert Morris Robert Morris is scrappy and athletic, but it's tough to write off Spartans Coach Tom Izzo. Especially this early. WEST ROAD GOES THROUGH UCONN Connecticut has to go out West, but it will have little competition out there. A UConn matchup with Memphis would be fun because Jim Calhoun and John Calipari don't like each other. Washington gets a favorable draw in Portland, Ore. If there's one tournament constant, it's this: Wild things happen in Boise. So watch out, Marquette and Missouri. UPSET SPECIALTami Chappell/Reuters No matchup epitomizes the mediocre nature of this N.C.A.A. tournament more than Maryland versus Cal. Each is well coached but not particularly talented. Look for Maryland to win an ugly game that no one should go out of their way to watch. Greivis Vasquez, pictured, leads the Terrapins. No. 1 Connecticut vs. No. 16 Chattanooga The Mocs should be happy to be here. But they won't be hanging around long; Connecticut will overwhelm them. No. 8 Brigham Young vs. No. 9 Texas A&M The Aggies are one of the most baffling seeds (the Big 12 was down this year). Look for B.Y.U. in a blowout. No. 5 Purdue vs. No. 12 Northern Iowa A great matchup for Purdue. The Missouri Valley Conference was down this year, and the Boilermakers are peaking. No. 4 Washington vs. No. 13 Mississippi State A pro-Huskies crowd in Portland and Mississippi State's tough travel schedule make this an easy pick. No. 6 Marquette vs. No. 11 Utah State Don't fall for it. This will be an upset pick because of Dominic James's injury. But Utah State has no quality wins. No. 3 Missouri vs. No. 14 Cornell This one should be fun; both teams can score. The Big Red should be able to keep up,but won't be able to win. No. 7 California vs. No. 10 Maryland Cal's seed is puzzling. Take Maryland on the basis that average A.C.C. teams are better than average Pac-10 teams. No. 2 Memphis vs. No. 15 Cal State Northridge The Tigers have a big talent drop-off from last year but can still overwhelm with defense and athleticism. DETROIT NATIONAL SEMIFINALS The talent drop-off past the No. 3 seeds is significant. Look for Louisville, Connecticut, Villanova and North Carolina to advance, and Louisville and North Carolina to reach the championship game. CHAMPIONSHIP GAME Louisville was the best team in the best conference. Its depth and movable parts make it the best choice."

Mrs. Annenberg, with her husband, Ambassador Walter H.

2009-03-16T00:00:00Z,"Coach Rick Pitino's teams have been defined by their doggedness, and this year's Louisville squad is no different. The ability to wear down teams with depth and relentlessness helped the Cardinals earn the tournament's No. 1 overall seed. Perhaps no player epitomizes Louisville's style of play more than the senior point guard Andre McGee. McGee, left, with sign, averaged 5.5 points in less than 20 minutes a game, and he might be the most unheralded player on a top seed. McGee, who joined the Cardinals as a big scorer out of California, has sacrificed his offense for the good of the team. He is a menace for opposing point guards as the Cardinals' best on-the-ball defender. At 5 feet 10 inches and 180 pounds, McGee has lowered his body fat to 7 percent from 18 percent since arriving at Louisville. Pitino likes McGee so much he hopes he will coach with him someday.

At least his mouth was: Tuck, who first joked that his teammates looked big and fat, declared that the Giants, who lost to the Eagles in the divisional round of the playoffs last season, were the team to beat in 2009. ''The players here and the coaching staff, the experience, we have been there and done it,'' Tuck said in a conference call with reporters. ''We know what it takes to get there. No one can deny that the team we had last year was headed that way until we got some injuries here and there along with distractions. All of that happens for a reason. On paper, I think the team to beat is definitely us.''"

2009-03-17T00:00:00Z,"CARPENTER--Harlow, co-founder and Vice President of the Sugarbush Ski Area and Sugarbush Golf Club in Warren, Vermont and grandson of Harlow E. Bundy, founder of the Bundy Time Recording Company which later became IBM, died on March 13, 2009 in Exeter, NH, where he lived. He was 82 years old. The cause was lung failure. Born in Los Angeles on October 20, 1926, Carpenter was a noted Modernist sculptor and architect. He received a Master of Architecture degree from Harvard University's Graduate School of Design in 1956. At his suggestion, his parents, Alfred and Helen Bundy Carpenter, donated the building known as the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts in 1961 to Harvard University, which is to this day the only building in the United States designed by the Swiss-French Modernist architect, Le Corbusier. In the late 1950s, Carpenter moved to Vermont where he became the largest financial investor of the founding team for the Sugarbush Ski Area and Sugarbush Golf Club in Warren, Vermont. With his strong vision for bringing the arts to rural Vermont, he later founded, designed and curated for the Bundy Art Gallery in 1962 in Waitsfield. In addition to housing his private Modern and contemporary art collection, the Gallery promoted the work of younger artists as well as provided the venue for the Vermont Symphony's summer concert series. The Bundy also served as a small, experimental school for K-6th graders during the academic year. Carpenter's early commitment to the environment was evidenced by the installation of the area's first wind generator, built on the Gallery's property. Carpenter was a renowned Modernist sculptor in New England, the subject of two television documentaries whose work was exhibited in numerous shows and exhibitions. His medium of choice was welded metal, composed mostly from used farm equipment. Carpenter served in the US Army during World War II where he was based in the Marshall Islands at the time of first atomic bomb tests. He was an avid horseman, founding the Sugarbush Polo Club in Vermont as well as the Green Mountain Hounds Fox Hunt. Later when he moved to Massachusetts and New Hampshire, he was an active participant in the Myopia Hunt and Myopia Polo in Hamilton, MA as well as several hunts in the Orange, VA area. He is survived, loved and missed by his wife, Barbara Carpenter, his stepson Nicholas Parker, his son Sebastian Carpenter, daughter Julia Carpenter, and three grandchildren. He is also survived by stepdaughter Lily Minas and stepson Matthew Esmiol. A celebration of his life will take place at his farm in Kensington, NH on April 26th at 1pm. In lieu of flowers, please make donations to OdysseyNH."

2009-03-18T00:00:00Z,"CARPENTER--Harlow, co-founder and Vice President of the Sugarbush Ski Area and Sugarbush Golf Club in Warren, Vermont and grandson of Harlow E. Bundy, founder of the Bundy Time Recording Company which later became IBM, died on March 13, 2009 in Exeter, NH, where he lived. He was 82 years old. The cause was lung failure. Born in Los Angeles on October 20, 1926, Carpenter was a noted Modernist sculptor and architect. He received a Master of Architecture degree from Harvard University's Graduate School of Design in 1956. At his suggestion, his parents, Alfred and Helen Bundy Carpenter, donated the building known as the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts in 1961 to Harvard University, which is to this day the only building in the United States designed by the Swiss-French Modernist architect, Le Corbusier. In the late 1950s, Carpenter moved to Vermont where he became the largest financial investor of the founding team for the Sugarbush Ski Area and Sugarbush Golf Club in Warren, Vermont. With his strong vision for bringing the arts to rural Vermont, he later founded, designed and curated for the Bundy Art Gallery in 1962 in Waitsfield. In addition to housing his private Modern and contemporary art collection, the Gallery promoted the work of younger artists as well as provided the venue for the Vermont Symphony's summer concert series. The Bundy also served as a small, experimental school for K-6th graders during the academic year. Carpenter's early commitment to the environment was evidenced by the installation of the area's first wind generator, built on the Gallery's property. Carpenter was a renowned Modernist sculptor in New England, the subject of two television documentaries whose work was exhibited in numerous shows and exhibitions. His medium of choice was welded metal, composed mostly from used farm equipment. Carpenter served in the US Army during World War II where he was based in the Marshall Islands at the time of first atomic bomb tests. He was an avid horseman, founding the Sugarbush Polo Club in Vermont as well as the Green Mountain Hounds Fox Hunt. Later when he moved to Massachusetts and New Hampshire, he was an active participant in the Myopia Hunt and Myopia Polo in Hamilton, MA as well as several hunts in the Orange, VA area. He is survived, loved and missed by his wife, Barbara Carpenter, his stepson Nicholas Parker, his son Sebastian Carpenter, daughter Julia Carpenter, and three grandchildren. He is also survived by stepdaughter Lily Minas and stepson Matthew Esmiol. A celebration of his life will take place at his farm in Kensington, NH on April 26th at 1pm. In lieu of flowers, please make donations to OdysseyNH."

Then I would like to have the option of discussing choices with my dining partners."

He is survived by his wife, Jamie Raab, and their children, son Ian Dalrymple and daughter Lola Dalrymple. The cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage. In a forty year career in book publishing as a literary contracts expert, he consulted with hundreds of authors, publishers and literary agents. He worked with such companies as Avon Books, Dell Publishing and Harper and Row (now HarperCollins), and then joined Warner Books as Director of Contracts where he stayed for 17 years. There, he met his wife, Jamie Raab, who is currently Publisher of Grand Central Books (formerly Warner Books). He was born in Waterloo, Iowa to Dwight Marion Dalrymple and Willa (Bette) Rasche, and grew up in Sarasota, Florida, before moving to New York City. Dennis loved New York City with the passion of a transplant, living first in Greenwich Village and in recent years on the Upper West Side. Mr. Dalrymple was a longtime anti-war activist who never met a war he wasn't prepared to protest. He was a founding member of the Youth International Party, its members known as Yippies, formed in 1967 by leftists and cultural icons Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner to radicalize hippie youth to protest the Vietnam War. He also nominated Pigasus the Pig for President at the 1968 convention. Mr. Dalrymple was an avid news junkie, an expert cook, a loyal friend, and, most of all, a devoted husband and father.

2009-03-19T23:39:08Z,"With only two shows in Austin, the singer-songwriter St. Vincent — born Annie Clark — has had the luxury of actually seeing other bands. She turned up at the Decemberists on Wednesday night and checked out her friends the Dirty Projectors at the NPR showcase on Thursday afternoon, a pretty enviable schedule. But she also has the benefit of festival experience: for several years she toured as part of the blissed-out collective the Polyphonic Spree. Before her solo show on Wednesday at the Central Presbyterian Church, she talked in the green room — if a church can have a green room — about how performing with them turned her into a guitar nerd. And don’t be fooled by the confluence of setting and stage name: Though St. Vincent is the patron saint of charity, Ms. Clark said her inspiration was not the patron saint of charity but the hospital where Dylan Thomas died. (Though she did notice a typo in the Ten Commandments poster hanging in the church: “You shall no other gods before me.”)"
2009-03-19T22:39:59Z,"An unfortunate consequence of seeing so many shows so quickly is that your mind goes into compartmentalization overdrive. This group is retro-electro-funk, that one is Velvet Underground-meets-Spacemen 3, another is hipster Appalachia, and so on.

2009-03-19T05:24:29Z,"There’s nothing like a jolt of post-punk dissonance to start South by Southwest, so I went for a double dose, in two distinct forms. The first was from Abe Vigoda, a California band that definitely knows how to tangle guitars. Its songs take an insistent, slightly asymmetrical guitar line, usually in a major key, that would be bright and pointed on its own. Then they throw on another line, equally jaunty but ending up dissonant where it scrapes up against the first riff. Those are driven by galloping drumbeats in lockstep with a peppy bass line, and topped with eagerly unkempt vocals and lyrics like “Tell us the future.” In their high-octane minimalism, the songs hurtle forward, neatly constructed but still reckless."

2009-03-19T08:34:10Z,"There’s something prosaically magical about music under a tin roof. Austin, with a tolerable public and an even more tolerable climate, tends to push music outside, behind many of its bars. There are some fancy decks here and there, but many are not more than pads of concrete, some chairs and yes, a tin roof. It’s probably not the most sonically subtle material, but yesterday, with the sun beating down and South by Southwest heating up, many corrugated canopies rattled and hummed."

2009-03-19T09:30:00Z,"At South by Southwest, the Central Presbyterian Church is almost always going to be a tough ticket. The bookings are carefully curated, the acoustics are great and the space is finite. But it was a whole order of tough outside the M. Ward gig last night. Wristbands and badges, the coin of the realm here, were all nigh useless as a crowd surrounded the church like a moat. And as it turned out, there was good reason to try and fight your way in. The violinist and vocalist Anni Rossi, who was signed by 4AD Records out of Minnesota – embraced the churchy vibe, sending ethereal sounds up into the rafters as people sat quietly before exploding with applause. And the reverence went up a notch when M. Ward came out. A huge cross was the only splash of light in the dimly lit church, apart from the flashes of cameras. The singer said very little, but played an exquisite set, including a Neil Young cover and guitar work that demonstrated that all those great words come from a very musical place. On “Sad, Sad Song,” he sang, “the hardest thing in the world to do is to find somebody believes in you.” Less hard, it should be pointed out, when you are in a church full of believers."

Their punk hootenanny sensibility reminds us that you don’t have to act serious to be taken seriously. South by Southwest, with its quick set ups and tear downs, is always technically challenged, but when these girls blew an amp, they vamped with the kind of jokes and entreaties that can’t be rendered here. Their feature slot at the Brooklyn Vegan party was probably a big deal, but they didn’t act like it, mixing it up with one another and the crowd. After they borrowed an amp from their friends and tour mates in Deer Tick, they borrowed the whole band as well, with the boys serving as accessories as the girls sang a kind of homage to a bird:"

After turning to Marxist theory, some of the workers rebel against their employer, while others turn to collective bargaining.

The lawsuit, which argues that state and federal equal protection laws were violated, was filed on behalf of a female student at Corona del Mar High School who was said to be a target of rape and death threats by male students. It contends that sexist and homophobic comments are common at the school and that school officials have done little in response. The school drama teacher, Ron Martin, said last month that the school’s principal, Fal Asrani, had canceled the “Rent” production; Ms. Asrani said that was not true, and later she approved the production. A spokeswoman for the Newport-Mesa Unified School District said that she had no immediate comment, but that one would be forthcoming."

2009-03-19T00:00:00Z,"IT takes planning, strength and guts to venture through a sheer terrain of snow and ice so treacherous that, if you find yourself suddenly sliding down the side of a mountain or into a crevasse, a metal weaponlike tool that may have as many as three sharp points could save your life. Every spring in the United States, as mountaineers of various skill levels eye certain snowy peaks -- Mount Washington in New Hampshire, Mount Rainier in Washington, the San Juan Mountains in Colorado -- mountaineering axes are often added to lists of essential gear. With temperatures higher, and avalanche hazards lessened despite plenty of remaining ice and hard snow, this is the time of year when many find those peaks most appealing. The axes usually remain uneventfully tethered to the wrist and are used like canes; the T-shaped top of the ax acts as a handle. But when a mountaineer slips, the shaft of this foreboding tool can be grasped so that the serrated knife-like point of the ax can be plunged into a frozen surface -- a gravity fighting technique known as ''self arrest.''"

2009-03-19T00:00:00Z,"IN late February 1860, Abraham Lincoln -- about to give the most important speech of his career to that point, at Cooper Union in New York -- took a stroll down Broadway. He was fascinated by the shops, the slums, the horse-drawn trolleys, the pedestrian throngs, and he couldn't help but notice the many museums that lined the bustling street, foremost among them P. T. Barnum's world-famous American Museum, with its menagerie of animals and oddities and carnival-like attractions. Lincoln dared not set foot inside. ''Museums were really sideshows back then,'' said Harold Holzer, author of more than 20 books on Lincoln and co-chairman of the Lincoln Bicentennial Commission. When Lincoln ''came back to New York as president-elect in 1861, I think Mary and the boys probably did go'' to Barnum's museum but Lincoln himself would not have, Mr. Holzer said, adding, ''He probably thought it was a little undignified.''"

2009-03-19T00:00:00Z,"NICHOLLS--Richard Hall, 70, of Stamford, CT, died March 14th after a courageous ten-year battle with cancer. He continues to be an inspiration to his devoted family and friends for his integrity, wisdom and keen sense of humor. Rich was a nationally recognized tax lawyer in the tax-exempt bond field. He was a former head of the tax department at Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon and was of counsel to Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. Rich was called ""the tax lawyer's tax lawyer"" in The Bond Lawyer and was a valued mentor and friend to the many successful attorneys he worked with during his 40-year career. His colleagues described him as insightful and creative, with an encyclopedic memory and an ability to ""say more with fewer words than anyone else they knew."" He did extensive pro bono work for the American Bar Association and the National Association of Bond Lawyers and in 2000, was awarded the Bernard P. Friel Award for distinguished service in public finance. Rich graduated from The Hill School, Amherst College and Stanford Law School and received a master's degree in tax from NYU. He was an avid sailor, skier and swimmer and a former Captain of the Amherst swimming team. He was a longtime member of the Stamford Yacht Club and loved racing competitively on his boat, Rhiannon. Above all, Rich was a man who knew how to enjoy life and cherish his family. He was a truly exceptional and loving father, brother and grandfather, as well as husband to his late wife, Anne. He will be dearly missed by all of his family and friends, including his devoted children, Jamie Nicholls Biondi and Christopher Nicholls, their spouses, Fran and Yvonne, his six much loved grandchildren, and his first wife and mother of his children, Judy Cormier. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Rich's honor to The Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy (attention: Betty Tucker), University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, 4301 West Markham St., Slot 816, Little Rock, AR 72205. A private gathering of friends to remember and honor Rich will be held in late April."

He built a fine house about half a mile east of town that stands at the oldest framed structure in the city. The house and its grounds are now surrounded by a stone wall and have been repurposed as a park that overlooks downtown."

Rain, whose real name is Jung Ji-hoon, was scheduled to perform at Aloha Stadium on June 15, 2007, but canceled the show a few days before the performance date. At the trial, lawyers for the promoter argued that Rain never intended to perform, and that his crew never shipped their equipment or applied for visas; Rain testified that his concert stage was not correctly set up, and that he was not involved in the decision to cancel the show. Promoters in Los Angeles have filed a similar suit, after a planned Rain concert at the Staples Center was canceled hours before show time."

2009-03-20T12:11:23Z,"Well. On Thursday night – sorry, technically Friday morning — I had one of those fabled SXSW experiences where wildly disparate musical experiences are jammed up against one another, both with their own pleasures. First there was the Rock the Rabbit party, sponsored by Playboy and complete with tail-wearing (and –baring) bunnies, free-flowing booze, an out-of-the-way location and a rumored-about “surprise” guest, Jane’s Addiction. The reunited group took the stage around 1:30 a.m. and did a tight, lively, and, for Austin this week, long set. Dave Navarro was shirtless and vamping for the cameras; Perry Farrell wore a tank and a grin and prowled the stage like an eager comeback model, which he sort of is; the crowd, many of whom were fans from 20 years ago, sang along, a relative rarity in a festival full of new bands."

2009-03-20T13:23:13Z,"The Philadelphia Orchestra took a step toward filling its leadership vacuum on Thursday when its board chose an investment company executive as chairman. The executive, Richard B. Worley, who is managing director of Permit Capital Group, LLC, will formally take over in September but will begin working with the interim chairman, Joseph Jacovini, now the orchestra said. Mr. Worley has been a member of the board since 2006, and he served a previous stint from 1997 to 2003. The move is likely to give impetus to the search for an executive director and a music director. Charles Dutoit is providing temporary artistic leadership and the orchestra has an acting executive director."

Mr. Weinberg is currently performing on Mr. Springsteen’s tour, which runs through August, but is scheduled to join Mr. O’Brien when the comedian becomes host of the “Tonight” show in June. In a release, Mr. Springsteen’s publicists said that for tour dates at which Mr. Weinberg cannot appear, he will be replaced by his son Jay. In a statement, Mr. Springsteen said: “I want to express my appreciation to Conan O’Brien, and everyone on his team, for making it possible for Max to continue to do double duty for both us and for him.

2009-03-20T18:32:58Z,"For the last several years, Playboy’s parties have been considered among the hardest to get into here, because of some combination of celebrity (Elijah Wood turned up once), well-known acts like Motley Crue and offbeat locations. On Thursday, in an old Safeway across the highway from most of the SXSW action, fans that were more scantily-dressed than the norm here came to see a reunited Jane’s Addiction do a “surprise” (that is to say, heavily rumored but unconfirmed) set. For the first time in many years, all the original members — including the bassist Eric Avery and the drummer Stephen Perkins — were accounted for, and seemed much happier than they had been in their heyday nearly two decades ago."

2009-03-20T20:07:48Z,"Sitting on the lawn at the French Legation Museum, with a sweet breeze and kids and dogs and families, thinking: What a lovely coincidence that one of the Tallest Man on Earth’s best songs, “The Gardener,” has a lot of flower imagery — lilies and roses and daisies. A perfect fit for this parklike setting, and the studious attention of fans of Other Music, the New York record store that helped organize this showcase.

Philip's innumerable friends and his family note with sadness the death of the gentlest, sweetest man any of us have ever known. World traveler of infinite curiosity and impeccable taste, Philip throughout his career, first at Macy's, then at Lord & Taylor, and in the years he was an independent furniture consultant, was influential in helping manufacturers in the Philippines and China to develop and export products to the American market. While at Lord & Taylor he also organized pioneering exhibitions of 20th century vintage furniture and objects and he was among the first to bring these works to the attention of collectors and museums. Beyond his professional credentials, his humanity, wit, grace, and charm made him beloved by everyone he met all over the world. His personal warmth was such that he had many friendships that endured over fifty years. An extraordinary son, brother, uncle, and godfather, Philip was someone who always put the well being of others ahead of his own. With his dearest friend Santiago Cortes, Philip took great joy in exploring the world, traveling to India, China, Peru, Egypt, Cuba, Jordan, Vietnam, and Thailand. Throughout this his love of New York City, his home for sixty years, was a constant in his life. For the last eleven years, he derived enormous pleasure from the beautiful view from his terrace overlooking Central Park. Philip's endearing modesty restrains us from praising him as much as we might want to. Our loss is deep, but the gift of having had him in our lives will never diminish. A memorial service is being planned. Contributions in Philip's memory can be made to New Yorkers for Parks, 355 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017 or to the charity of your choice.

George was the beloved son of Rose and Andrew Mangini. 12 nieces and nephews survive him. A serious art collector and consummate New Yorker, he was born on August 3, 1920, the third of five children. He attended both parochial and public schools in New York, and after serving in the Pacific theater during World War II, he returned to New York, and in 1948 received a B.A. from New York University. He then lived in Rome for a short time and later in Paris where he studied at the Sorbonne. He returned to New York in the early 1950s and lived in the same apartment for the next 60 years. He worked for Lord & Taylor in the antiques department and as a silver buyer for Tiffany & Co. Later, he started the Gallery Shop at the Brooklyn Museum, and then the Crafts of All Nations shops at The United Nations.

The assistants seem to brace for it; some even talk back to him. Williams will even stand there and rant to himself, pleading for an answer to how something like this could happen."

The man, Josias Kumpf, admitted that he participated in a murderous November 1943 Nazi operation that went by the code name Aktion Erntefest -- Operation Harvest Festival -- in which roughly 42,000 Jewish men, women and children were killed at three Nazi camps in eastern Poland in two days. Mr. Kumpf acknowledged that his role was as a guard and an assassin at the Trawniki Labor Camp, where 8,000 men, women and children were shot dead on Nov. 3, 1943, Justice Department officials said.

2009-03-20T00:00:00Z,"RICHARDSON--Natasha. The board of trustees and staff of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, mourn the sudden, tragic loss of our good friend and amfAR trustee Natasha Richardson. An ardent advocate of AIDS research, Ms. Richardson was an eloquent and persuasive spokesperson who generously contributed her time and resources to amfAR over a period of more than 15 years. She brought to our cause an exquisite combination of warmth, intelligence, drive, poise, and glamour. While her initial motivation for supporting AIDS causes was prompted by the death of her father from AIDS, it was clear that her abiding commitment was the product of her own deep-seated compassion for all people. Among many accomplishments, in 1999 she spearheaded Unforgettable: Fashion of the Oscars, an auction of Oscar dresses that raised more than $1.5 million. In November 2000, she was honored with amfAR's Award of Courage. In September 2006, Ms. Richardson joined amfAR's board of trustees, and most recently she was a featured speaker at the Foundation's annual New York Gala fundraiser on February 12, 2009. On that occasion, she spoke passionately about recent progress in AIDS research and voiced her optimism that a cure for AIDS will be found. Her radiant enthusiasm will be sorely missed by all at amfAR and by the HIV/AIDS community worldwide. Our hearts go out to Liam, the children, and the whole family.

2009-03-20T00:00:00Z,"DALRYMPLE--Dennis M.,died Thursday, March 5, in New York City. He was 67. He is survived by his wife, Jamie Raab, and their children, son Ian Dalrymple and daughter Lola Dalrymple. The cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage. In a forty year career in book publishing as a literary contracts expert, he consulted with hundreds of authors, publishers and literary agents. He worked with such companies as Avon Books, Dell Publishing and Harper and Row (now HarperCollins), and then joined Warner Books as Director of Contracts where he stayed for 17 years. There, he met his wife, Jamie Raab, who is currently Publisher of Grand Central Books (formerly Warner Books). He was born in Waterloo, Iowa to Dwight Marion Dalrymple and Willa (Bette) Rasche, and grew up in Sarasota, Florida, before moving to New York City. Dennis loved New York City with the passion of a transplant, living first in Greenwich Village and in recent years on the Upper West Side. Mr. Dalrymple was a longtime anti-war activist who never met a war he wasn't prepared to protest. He was a founding member of the Youth International Party, its members known as Yippies, formed in 1967 by leftists and cultural icons Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner to radicalize hippie youth to protest the Vietnam War. He also nominated Pigasus the Pig for President at the 1968 convention. Mr. Dalrymple was an avid news junkie, an expert cook, a loyal friend, and, most of all, a devoted husband and father. Mr. Dalrymple is also survived by his sister, Sandra Scanlan; his stepmother, Marion Dalrymple; his four half sisters Jennifer Heit, Julie Rexford, Jere Gilbert and Jane Murphy.

There was no joke about BO PEEP’s brutally efficient riffing, whether the band was bashing out brusque one-chord stomps or dissonant metal lines or blaring punk.

Taking the stage in their trademark gray jumpsuits, they played in front of an enormous video screen with images that were at once sharply designed and satirical – like a scrolling riff on the iPod commercial dancers, who slowly morphed into apes, a double-edged pun (‘devo’ stands for devolution). Is Devo making fun of the music industry? Yes, of course. But they’re having fun doing it, sort of. “After hatching this about 30 years ago as an art school joke, it’s now an all too hideous reality,” Gerald Casale, one of the groups founders, said at a press conference earlier in the day, Billboard.com reported. “So we’re just here to entertain everybody who’s as devolved as we are now.”"

2009-03-22T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I hope that Amtrak’s weaknesses take their sweet time catching up with those of the airlines, because my husband and I prefer to ride trains, even though their already-higher costs keep rising and the erratic amenities are gradually eroding. We love watching the rivers and mountains pass by, towns light up, stations come and go; we love talking in the dark from our respective bunks as the train rattles and sways as it takes us to our destination. There is time to read, to write, and to think about where we’ve been, where we’re headed. Amtrak used to offer “slumber coaches,” tiny individual compartments only slightly more expensive than regular coach fare. Reviving those would make us monumentally happy. There is a Zen saying: Do not hasten, my friend — you may arrive. Carol Pearce-Worthington."

During a 9-to-10-hour trip, this train goes through more than 250 tunnels and hugs countless mountainsides. The route was constructed by Tito in the 1970s and had no true economic purpose. But it does provide an unforgettable rail experience. Steve Kutay."

After nearly a decade without a permanent space of its own, the city’s leading contemporary art gallery, Kurimanzutto (Gobernador Rafael Rebollar 94), finally christened its new home in November. The renovated lumberyard building shows Mexican and international artists including Miguel Calderón and Rirkrit Tiravanija. In the Roma neighborhood, the popular graffiti- and street-art gallery Centro Cultural Border (Zacatecas 43) moved into a larger space and added a lively cafe and bookshop. And a few doors down from the restaurant Contramar (Durango 200), an art-scene hangout, the curator Fernando Mesta shows local talent like Guillermo Santamarina (right) at his new space, Gaga (Durango 204). On the institutional front, the big arrival is the Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo (Insurgentes Sur 3000), which made a splashy opening with a notorious installation by Miguel Ventura that used Nazi imagery and live lab rats. The Centro Cultural Universitario Tlatelolco (Ricardo Flores Magón 1), a former government ministry, shows a stirring exhibit about Mexico’s 1968 student rebellion; it also houses the Colección Blaisten, which has a remarkable private collection of Mexican painting from the revolution to the 1980s.

2009-03-22T00:00:00Z,"It feels almost wrong to call Bioparc Valencia a zoo, even though the $75 million menagerie, which completes its first building phase in the Spanish city this spring, is home to some 4,000 animals. It’s more like an ecologically minded theme park. There are no cages on the almost 25 acres, and species mingle in recreated ecosystems as they would in the wild. Impalas run with giraffes and rhinos chase zebras at the African Savanna exhibit. Lions observe this delectable scene (but dine elsewhere) from atop granite cliffs. Visitors take it all in on paths separated from the animals by rivers or rocks or, as in the tropical jungle, from inside tunnels disguised as fallen trees. And these are only the visible innovations. Because many of the 250 species are endangered or threatened, the park is creating reserve populations that could be returned to the wild. “It is a last resort in the case of extinction,” says Bioparc’s general director, Koen Brouwer. “We prefer to use the animals as ambassadors to make people aware of the dangers and prevent the worst.” Apartado de Correos 15005; bioparcvalencia.es/ingles.html.

2009-03-22T00:00:00Z,"FROM LAP DOGS TO SNOW GLOBES to Fabergé eggs, miniatures have always delighted humanity, and — if my vacations are any indication — countries are no exception. In my travels, I’ve often gone hundreds of miles out of my way to visit improbably tiny sovereign states, not knowing myself what it was that drew me to them, and usually regretting the detour. Andorra, that enigmatic republic in the Pyrenees, revealed itself to be a cluster of duty-free shops and dusty, neglected-looking hills; Monaco felt like a glorified suburb of Nice; and Vatican City, despite the pomp, seemed like little more than one of Rome’s less charming neighborhoods. As with any obsession, however, disappointment only sharpened my desire. The impossible country of my imagination existed somewhere, I was sure of it: the fact that I hadn’t been there yet was the best proof of its magical obscurity. What’s more, I had a hunch as to this mysterious nation’s location, and even as to what it might be called. I was reasonably sure its name was Liechtenstein."

2009-03-22T00:00:00Z,"For women who love a perfect pair of heels, the French shoe designer Christian Louboutin is a gatekeeper to desire. Thankfully, he makes shoes — ultra-high stilettos, pumps covered in spikes, marzipan-colored lace-ups — that cater to almost any fancy. When it comes to his craft, Louboutin is unyielding. “When I design my summer collection, I must work in a hot place,” he says. “And I must be in a cold place when I design for winter.” This year he chose Brazil for the summer; his estate in the French countryside has no heat and is therefore ideal for wintertime. A consummate globe-trotter, Louboutin always packs light: “I only do carry-on.” But what about fanatics who can’t bear to part with their Louboutins when they travel? “My advice to them would be to ship the pairs before. That way, they can bring as many as they’d like.” [?][?][?] ALEX HAWGOOD."

Virtual experiences, commerce and relationships are real. Struck with these new mixed realities, many in the field have replaced the terms “real life” and “real world” with “physical life” and “physical world,” because virtual spaces, whether they are fictional or imagined, are not imaginary.

2009-03-22T00:00:00Z,"HOW much does it cost to own a car? Wheels readers debated that issue after I posted an article about how the recession has helped to decrease driving. I have since found that the cost of car ownership is probably a whole lot more than you think. If your estimates are based on what you paid for your vehicle, plus the cost of gas, oil and repairs, you're forgetting about insurance, depreciation, parking fees, tolls and registration, among other things. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, American ''consumer units'' (similar to a household) spent an average of $8,758 on all forms of transportation in 2007 (up 2.9 percent from 2006). We're a car-owning country, so only $537.81 of our average spending went to public transit, including taxis and air travel. The latter expenses would appear to skew the statistics because the lowest-income fifth of the population spent an average of $171.30 annually on transit and the richest fifth $1,406.45."

2009-03-22T00:00:00Z,"ROZEK--Professor Edward J. October 13, 1918-February 19, 2009. Edward Rozek passed away at his home of natural causes on February 19, 2009. A professor of comparative governments at the University of Colorado, he was born and raised in Poland. After the country was overrun by Hitler and Stalin, he escaped via Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Italy to France. There he joined the First Polish Armored Brigade which took part in the defense of Paris. After France fell, he made his way to England. He became commander of a platoon of tanks in the 10th Reconnaissance Regiment of the First Polish Armoured Division, which fought from Normandy to northern Germany. He was wounded three times. The last time he was blinded by an anti-tank land mine and spent 10 months in English and Scottish hospitals. He received four Purple Hearts, three Crosses of Valor, four British war medals, and Polonia Restituta Officer Class and Komandoria. He ended his military career with the rank of Major. In 1948, the British Government gave him, as a former officer, a one-way ticket to anywhere in the world. He chose to take the Queen Mary to America. He arrived with no family, only $50 and a suitcase full of books. After working on a dairy farm and then a gas station to earn college tuition, he was admitted to Harvard where he earned three degrees: A.B. (magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa), A.M. and Ph.D. In 1956, he became a professor of comparative governments at the University of Colorado. He directed the Central and East European Studies Program for 25 years and was deputy editor of the Journal of Central and East European Affairs. He founded and for 34 years directed the Institute for the Study of Economic and Political Freedom. He also founded and directed from 1972 to 1999 the Center for Science and Technology, which organized numerous conferences in which several Nobel Prize winners and other distinguished scholars from American and European universities participated. He lectured at many universities and public institutions in the United States, Europe, South Korea, the Republic of China, and South Africa. Professor Rozek wrote several books. The best-known is Allied Wartime Diplomacy, for which he received the National Book Foundation Award. The American philosopher Sidney Hook dedicated his book, Academic Freedom and Academic Anarchy, as follows: ""To Edward J. Rozek---Embattled fighter for free men, free society and the free university against fascism, communism and totalitarian liberalism."" CU students elected him Professor of the Year and Distinguished Faculty Member. After teaching for 43 years at the University of Colorado, Professor Rozek retired in 1999. From 2000 to 2003, he held the Endowed Garnsey-Rozek Professorship in Economics and Political Freedom at the University of Northern Colorado. During the 1980 Presidential campaign, Professor Rozek was a member of Ronald Reagan's Advisory Council on Defense and Foreign Policy. He was an honorary member of the legendary Solidarity of Poland and received Knighthood in the Venerable Order of St. John, which was founded around 1100 AD. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; his sons, Christopher and Jonathan, and four grandchildren, Alexander, Philip, Thomas and Christina. Services were held at Sacred Heart of Mary Church in Boulder, CO on February 24. Memorial contributions can be made to the Orphanage for the Blind and the Deaf and sent to Wells Fargo Bank, PO Box 227, Boulder, CO 80306-9980."

He was a former head of the tax department at Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon and was of counsel to Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. Rich was called ""the tax lawyer's tax lawyer"" in The Bond Lawyer and was a valued mentor and friend to the many successful attorneys he worked with during his 40-year career. His colleagues described him as insightful and creative, with an encyclopedic memory and an ability to ""say more with fewer words than anyone else they knew."" He did extensive pro bono work for the American Bar Association and the National Association of Bond Lawyers and in 2000, was awarded the Bernard P. Friel Award for distinguished service in public finance. Rich graduated from The Hill School, Amherst College and Stanford Law School and received a master's degree in tax from NYU. He was an avid sailor, skier and swimmer and a former Captain of the Amherst swimming team. He was a longtime member of the Stamford Yacht Club and loved racing competitively on his boat, Rhiannon. Above all, Rich was a man who knew how to enjoy life and cherish his family. He was a truly exceptional and loving father, brother and grandfather, as well as husband to his late wife, Anne. He will be dearly missed by all of his family and friends, including his devoted children, Jamie Nicholls Biondi and Christopher Nicholls, their spouses, Fran and Yvonne, his six much loved grandchildren, and his first wife and mother of his children, Judy Cormier.

Mr. Schaff, 49, has contracts that guarantee work with four orchestras, including the Stamford Symphony Orchestra and Long Island Philharmonic. He substitutes in others, including the Westfield Symphony Orchestra in Union County. And he takes side work, like Broadway shows, in between. But side work has grown scarcer as Broadway retrenches. Substitute jobs are in shorter supply. Nearly all the orchestras Mr. Schaff regularly plays for are offering less work than in the past, because of the economic downturn. And one of those groups, the Opera Orchestra of New York, has just canceled its two remaining shows this season at Carnegie Hall, citing significant reductions in ''all areas of public support.''"

2009-03-22T00:00:00Z,"For years, I missed out on March Madness. During my sophomore, junior and senior years at Penn, we dropped games in the first round. It's tough to turn on the television for games when you've let your dream slip out of your fingers. So for three years, I avoided tournament pools like the plague, licked my wounds and recovered in time to watch the Final Four. This year, I thought I'd lose the best weeks in sports for a different reason. When I won a Marshall scholarship to go to Oxford University, giving up basketball was just part of the bargain. The time difference meant games didn't typically end until 3 a.m., and worse, the British aren't exactly basketball fans. It's almost impossible to catch a game on TV. Naturally, I assumed that when March Madness rolled around, I'd find myself hunched over my laptop, streaming games from CBS."

2009-03-22T00:00:00Z,"McNEELY--Donald, ventured forth from this life on March 9 in Pebble Beach, California, a place he had been drawn to while exploring the most exclusive golf courses of the West Coast with a friend before shipping off to the Pacific Theater of WWII. He was 94 years old and his long life was filled with adventures and successes, unflagging faith and courage, and boundless acts of kindness. Up to the end, he was as sharp as the day he graduated from Yale in 1937. A student of history, keen on current events, he clipped out articles voraciously for family and friends from publications from around the world. Always eager to know more about the world, his enthusiasm for life was evident in his booming voice and ready cheerfulness. His nimble mind, unique wit and impressive vocabulary made him a captivating communicator and wordsmith. His adventures took him from the playing fields of Yale to the wartime battle of Guadalcanal while in the Navy's special intelligence department to the ranks of handpicked advisors serving on Ronald Reagan's ""Grace Commission"". Don was born on July 10, 1914, in St. Paul, MN and went to St. Paul Academy where sports became one of his grand delights. He won the state squash championship in 1955-57, threw the ball around with his friend, Hank Greenberg, in wartime baseball games, and played tennis until he was 90. In 1962, he became co-owner of the Minnesota Vikings and helped bring the Washington Senators to Minnesota as the Minnesota Twins. He enjoyed the company of others and that translated into club memberships around the country, many involving golf and tennis, like the Cypress Point Club in Pebble Beach, the White Bear Lake Yacht Club, the Yale Club and River Club of New York City; the Minneapolis Club; the Los Angeles Country Club; and the Old Capital Club in Monterey, CA. Sportsmanship influenced how he lived his life. Fair and honorable (his son Kevin said he never made a joke at someone else's expense), he supported causes important to him and paid tribute to those who helped him along the way. He memorialized his beloved aunt and uncle with the Lee and Rose Warner Coliseum at the Minnesota State Fair and the Palestra sports center at St. John's University in Collegeville, MN (where he also funded the McNeely Spectrum, the campus field house), and helped establish the Rose Warner Writing Center and the soon-to-be Rose Warner Science Lab at the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth, MN. He was dedicated to environmental education which resulted over forty years ago in the creation of The Lee and Rose Warner Nature Center, which partners with the Science Museum of Minnesota. He raised five children with his wife and great love, Marjorie, and founded in her name the Marjorie McNeely Conservatoryat Como Park, the Marjorie McNeely Gallery at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, and the Marjorie McNeely Fund for the Blind or Illiterate in Monterey County, CA. A savvy entrepreneur and a innovative thinker, he joined his father's business- The St. Paul Terminal Warehouse Company-after the war and turned it into a national company called Space Center, Inc. He was co-founder of Control Data Corporation and his past directorships include Buckbee-Mears; Conwed Corporation; North Star Research & Development Institute; North Star Steel; Northwest Airlines; Wells Fargo (Norwest Bank); and Red Owl Stores. To give young men and women the skills to succeed in business, he established the Donald McNeely Center for Entrepreneurship at St. John's University in Collegeville, MN. From his cherished home on Manitou Island in White Bear Lake, MN, Don reached out into the community and beyond to help guide religious, civic, arts, and educational organizations like the Catholic Charities, Como Friends, Guthrie Theater, The McNeely Foundation, YMCA, and Yale University where he founded scholarships. Standing at six feet, five inches tall, he was referred to by family and their friends affectionately as ""Big D"" and left a sizable wake behind him. Donning a bow tie and bachelor button in his lapel, he displayed his own dapper style. He was a generous man, not only with his resources and his time, but also with his heart. Wary of inherited wealth he had optimum respect for those who generated their own good fortune and success. He encouraged his children in their passions believing that he himself ""did not work a day in his life"" as he remained active in business until his passing day. His daughter Nora wrote of her father last year that his rich and meaningful life had exuded character that was ""deep, genuine, complicated, and beautiful"". Those who knew him found him to be a true gentlemen and an original and are fortunate souls indeed. His wife Marjorie (nee Reeds) died in 1998. His children, Nora McNeely (Michael) Hurley, Robin Brooks Tost, Greg McNeely, Kevin (Rosemary) McNeely, and Peter (Incy) Brooks, survive him; as do his grandchildren Jamie Tost, Jen (Pete) Masterson, Peter (Jen) Brooks Jr., Holly (Eric) Robinson, and Hannah Rose McNeely and great-grandchildren Piper and Pen Brooks and Miles Masterson; brother Harry G. McNeely, Jr. and eleven nieces and nephews. A memorial Mass and reception to celebrate his life will be held in the spring. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to The Marjorie McNeely Conservatory at Como Park, 1225 Estabrook Drive, St. Paul, MN 55103."

Hanna was born in Canonsburg, PA and lived in Summit, NJ for many years until he moved to the Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo, FL and Hound Ears Club in Blowing Rock, NC. He passed away peacefully on February 26, 2009. As a farm boy growing up in western Pennsylvania during the Great Depression, he mowed the lawn at the church cemetery for 25 cents an hour and worked to put himself through night school. He graduated with honors from the University of Pittsburgh (where he was a member of the Beta Gamma Sigma Honor Society) and later graduated from the Credit and Financial Management School at Dartmouth College. He grew up to fight for the country he loved, experience a highly successful business career, help others and his community, and be a loyal and loving husband, father and grandfather. He enlisted as a Private in the Army in 1941, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the 101st Airborne Division. He received the Bronze Star, Belgian Croix de Guirre, Dutch Order of William, Presidential Citation with Cluster, and the World War II Victory Medal. After the war, he spent 32 years at Manufacturers Hanover Corporation in New York. He was in charge of its banking in the eastern half of the United States. Later in his career at the Holding Company, he developed its financial-related businesses in consumer finance, leasing and mortgage banking, as well as its footprint in upstate New York. He was a member of the Association of Reserve City Bankers. Paul also served as a director of United Jersey Banks and several of its subsidiaries. Always looking for new challenges, Paul retired early as Executive Vice President of Manufacturers Hanover to become Vice Chairman of GEICO Corporation in Washington, DC and Chairman of its financial services company in Denver. While at GEICO, he negotiated the purchase of 25% interest in AVEMCO, a general aviation insurance company, and served on its board for 15 years. Later, he negotiated the purchase of Manufacturers Hanover Mortgage Company for Fireman's Fund Insurance Company and served on its board (which was called Source One Mortgage Services Company in Southfield, Michigan) for several years. Over the years, Paul served on the boards of 45 companies in banking, insurance and financial-related businesses. Paul cared deeply for others and the communities in which he lived. He served on the board of Rider University for many years and as its Chairman for three years. He received an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws from Rider in 1989. As the basis of this award, Rider noted that Paul was ""a man who has devoted his entire life to the common good - in service to his country, to business, and to education"". He founded and served as President of the Hanna Foundation which has provided philanthropic support for many deserving causes during Paul's lifetime and going forward. Also, he served as President of the board of the Ocean Reef Medical Center and he helped to build its Foundation of which he had also served as President. Paul was governor of the Ocean Reef Yacht Club and a member of the Angler's Club in Key Largo Florida. In addition, he served on the boards of the Greater Miami YMCA and Lees McRae College. Paul's hobby and passion was golf. He enjoyed taking his sons on golfing ventures around the nation and world including numerous outings in Scotland, England, Ireland and Australia. He always remembered walking off the 18th green with his sons at St. Andrews' Old Course late in his life. Paul was a member and served as President of Baltusrol Golf Club. He also belonged to Burning Tree Golf Club, Columbia Country Club, Card Sound Golf Club and Hound Ears Club Paul loved and was devoted to his family. His first wife, Grace Hanna, died in 1989 after 43 years of marriage. His second wife, Joan Chapin Hanna, died in 1999. He is survived by his two sons and their wives: Paul II (Sandra) and Lee (Mindy), and five grandchildren.

Philip's innumerable friends and his family note with sadness the death of the gentlest, sweetest man any of us have ever known. World traveler of infinite curiosity and impeccable taste, Philip throughout his career, first at Macy's, then at Lord & Taylor, and in the years he was an independent furniture consultant, was influential in helping manufacturers in the Philippines and China to develop and export products to the American market. While at Lord & Taylor he also organized pioneering exhibitions of 20th century vintage furniture and objects and he was among the first to bring these works to the attention of collectors and museums. Beyond his professional credentials, his humanity, wit, grace, and charm made him beloved by everyone he met all over the world. His personal warmth was such that he had many friendships that endured over fifty years. An extraordinary son, brother, uncle, and godfather, Philip was someone who always put the well being of others ahead of his own. With his dearest friend Santiago Cortes, Philip took great joy in exploring the world, traveling to India, China, Peru, Egypt, Cuba, Jordan, Vietnam, and Thailand. Throughout this his love of New York City, his home for sixty years, was a constant in his life. For the last eleven years, he derived enormous pleasure from the beautiful view from his terrace overlooking Central Park. Philip's endearing modesty restrains us from praising him as much as we might want to. Our loss is deep, but the gift of having had him in our lives will never diminish. A memorial service is being planned. Contributions in Philip's memory can be made to New Yorkers for Parks, 355 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017 or to the charity of your choice.

Next is Italy, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and then back to Germany. Here you see me cycling up a hill in the heat of southern Spain in the natural park, just before Almería.

For this issue, he shot the tourist playground of Bali -- ''a very different place of contradictions,'' he says. (''How Green Is My Bali'' is on Page 78.) A recipient of the Henri Cartier-Bresson Award, Goldberg was recently commissioned to document migration and refugee trafficking throughout Europe; ''Current,'' from 2006, is at center.

Roger joined the firm in 1976 and was part of the team that built our banking and securities practice, which he led from 1996 to 2004. He was elected a director in 1986 and led our New York Office in 1995-96. Roger co-founded McKinsey's investment office, was a member of the firm's board, chaired the finance committee, and was a member of the office of the managing partner. More importantly, he was a friend and mentor to a generation of colleagues, teaching many of us how to solve the most challenging problems and how to convey answers to clients with both absolute candor and empathy. He earned the trust of business and government leaders around the world, who relied on his counsel, as did a wide circle of friends who prized his wit, erudition and unflagging kindness. Roger leaves a rich legacy at McKinsey, where he played the ""loyal opposition"" challenging complacency and destroying faulty logic. In 2007, Roger established the McKinsey Center for Advanced Problem Solving to ensure that our teams will always have the most sophisticated tools to solve our clients' problems. Roger was President of Friends of the Atlantic Partnership, which promotes dialogue between European and U.S. opinion leaders, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. His philanthropic activities centered on issues of adoption, as Chairman of Whole Child International, and through the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute. We will miss Roger's extraordinary intellect and his dedication to the firm and its clients.

You can hear traces of the group's caterwauling guitars and the raw warble of its lead singer, Paul Westerberg, in current acts like the Killers and Arcade Fire. The group released eight studio albums before breaking up in 1991, leaving behind a whole lot of smashed guitars and a deep catalog of punk-pop prototypes like ""Unsatisfied"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"" - which recently showed up on the playlist of New York's awesome new WRXP-FM (101.9) and is also covered by Justin Townes Earle on his latest CD, ""Midnight at the Movies.""

Roger joined the firm in 1976 and was part of the team that built our banking and securities practice, which he led from 1996 to 2004. He was elected a director in 1986 and led our New York Office in 1995-96. Roger co-founded McKinsey's investment office, was a member of the firm's board, chaired the finance committee, and was a member of the office of the managing partner. More importantly, he was a friend and mentor to a generation of colleagues, teaching many of us how to solve the most challenging problems and how to convey answers to clients with both absolute candor and empathy. He earned the trust of business and government leaders around the world, who relied on his counsel, as did a wide circle of friends who prized his wit, erudition and unflagging kindness. Roger leaves a rich legacy at McKinsey, where he played the ""loyal opposition"" challenging complacency and destroying faulty logic. In 2007, Roger established the McKinsey Center for Advanced Problem Solving to ensure that our teams will always have the most sophisticated tools to solve our clients' problems. Roger was President of Friends of the Atlantic Partnership, which promotes dialogue between European and U.S. opinion leaders, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. His philanthropic activities centered on issues of adoption, as Chairman of Whole Child International, and through the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute. We will miss Roger's extraordinary intellect and his dedication to the firm and its clients.

Only 11 teams in the N.C.A.A. tournament this year had such a big advantage in fouls. Twenty had negative numbers, including Louisville."

CBS led the night over all, broadcasting ''The Amazing Race'' around 9 (11.6 million) and ''Cold Case'' at 10 (10.8 million). ABC was a close runner-up, largely because of ''Desperate Housewives'' (14.7 million). NBC ranked third for the night, as its new series ''Kings'' (4.6 million) continued to struggle at 8.

And youthful freshness was the hallmark of the accomplished performance of Brahms's First Symphony that Mr. McAdams led with this impressive ensemble on Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall. Beyond the technical confidence, it was the unjaded enthusiasm of the playing that made the Brahms so rewarding. It is impossible for the performance of a staple to slip into routine when the orchestra is made up of gifted young musicians, many playing the piece for the first time."

The sassy girlfriend is a party, but then she begins exhibiting symptoms of a mysterious disease, which puts a damper on her enthusiasm for girl talk. One of the livelier exchanges in this odd and frustrating play is an intimate colloquy between a man and a pretzel stick."

2009-03-24T00:00:00Z,"ROBERT C. BYRD, the Democratic senator from West Virginia, chastised the Obama administration last month for using White House policy czars to undermine the president's own cabinet. ''At the worst,'' he wrote to President Obama, ''White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.'' Mr. Byrd is right to question the proliferation of policy czars -- after all, President Obama inherited a half-dozen czar positions from previous administrations and has already added more of his own, including czars for health, urban affairs and ''green jobs.'' But czars are rarely the fearsome giants of interference that concern Mr. Byrd. Most have more stalemates than successes, hardly ever receive the presidential attention they were promised and often quit in frustration."

But there is not much, beyond faith, to believe those assumptions will pan out -- and even if there were, it is hard to see how the plan is the best way to go. In the near term, the plan would provide financing to buy $500 billion of banks' bad assets -- and possibly up to $1 trillion over time. Most of the financing would be in the form of low-cost government loans and loan guarantees for private investors who buy the troubled assets."

Is it possible this disappearing act presages the future of the circus itself? The down economy has taken its toll on working-class families, the traditional core audience of Ringling, a show-business perennial that offended circus purists by abandoning its classic three rings three years ago.

And it's true: Ms. Silvers is a certain kind of intrepid New York artist, an unrepentant experimentalist who has had a long and lauded career without ever becoming a known name outside the contemporary-dance world. ''Yessified!,'' Ms. Silvers's first big group work since 2005, is entirely puzzling. And entirely delightful, partly for that reason. As the nine dancers (including Ms. Silvers) endlessly enter and exit, forming and re-forming groups that perform strange, truncated gestures and bendy, bouncy little steps, it's interesting to contemplate why some artists are able to leave you feeling fine -- even exhilarated -- by the realization that you have absolutely no idea what's going on."

More recently, I came across the rich research from social psychology suggesting that expertise is typically overrated in any case, and that experts often don't do much better than neophytes.

2009-03-25T00:00:00Z,"The European Commission said that ''very significant subjects'' still need to be resolved before it can complete a tariff reduction agreement with South Korea. Already facing a catastrophic reduction in sales because of the global economic downturn, the European automotive industry reacted with alarm to the announcement at a news conference in Seoul early Tuesday of a proposed agreement to ease trade restrictions. But the European Commission's spokesman on trade, Lutz Güllner, moved quickly to tamp down suggestions that the bloc was on the verge of signing an agreement. Among the issues left to be resolved, Mr. Güllner said, was a timetable for eliminating the Europe's 10 percent tariff on imported cars. If a deal is completed, it will be a rare move toward free trade at a time when politicians across the globe are under pressure to resort to protectionism. A free trade agreement between the United States and South Korea, reached in 2007, has not been ratified in part because some American Congressional leaders fear the agreement would be detrimental to the nation's automakers. A successful deal with the European Union could put pressure on American leaders to approve the agreement. STEPHEN CASTLE"

That was because Syracuse ran through the gantlet of top Big 12 teams -- Oklahoma State, Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas -- on the way. Perhaps the biggest reason the Orange won that title was because the former assistant Troy Weaver landed Carmelo Anthony, who has become college basketball's one-and-done prototype. The next biggest reason was the Orange's 2-3 zone defense, which left Big 12 teams looking as if they were staring at the equation from ''Good Will Hunting.''"

A court in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the southeast, issued the arrest warrant for the officer, Col. Cemal Temizoz, pending a trial. Colonel Temizoz served near the town of Cizre, about 40 miles from the Iraqi border in Turkey's southeast, from 1993 to 1996, when hundreds of Kurdish civilians and activists were said to have been killed by security forces with links to the military. In excavations around Cizre, officials have so far found pieces of clothing and at least 20 bones, which will be subject to DNA examination."

There is an enormous opportunity for a C.E.O. to come forward with a plan to reform the financial system and pledge a change from business as usual. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, has been the most outspoken of his peers during the crisis -- and has done an admirable job addressing the issues -- but he has been more focused on helping instill confidence in the economy and the health of his own firm. John Mack, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, has shown glimpses of public leadership, at one point apologizing for the crisis by saying, ''We are sorry for it.''"

The 14-month-old girl, named Mercy James, comes from the same orphanage as Madonna’s son, David Banda, 3, whom she met in 2006 and whose adoption was completed last year. That adoption proved briefly controversial when Madonna was accused of circumventing Malawian laws that prevent foreigners from adopting children. Madonna is expected to arrive in Malawi over the weekend and appear in court on Monday for adoption proceedings. She has a daughter, Lourdes, 12, from her relationship with the trainer and actor Carlos Leon, and a son, Rocco, 8, from her marriage with the filmmaker Guy Ritchie.

The news was confirmed by the office of State Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentol, who represents Greenpoint and Williamsburg. “This is the continuation of McCarren Park Pool,” Ms. Thayer said. “It’s different, but it has its own exquisite beauty, with the waterfront and the skyline of Manhattan.” She added that she plans to work with many of the promoters who put on events at the pool, but that if enough sponsorship money comes through, she hopes to also put on classical and opera concerts as well.

In March, the hip-hop star, whose given name is Clifford Harris, pleaded guilty to three charges of illegal weapons possession, after he was arrested in 2007 following a sting operation as he received three machine guns and two silencers that had been bought for him. Mr. Harris had faced up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count and initially pleaded not guilty to the charges. Since changing his plea, he has performed more than 1,000 hours of community service and appeared on a reality series, “T.I.’s Road to Redemption,” on which he warned teens about the dangers of guns and violence. He will have between 30 and 60 days to report to prison."

He is survived by his wife, Jamie Raab, and their children, son Ian Dalrymple and daughter Lola Dalrymple. The cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage. In a forty year career in book publishing as a literary contracts expert, he consulted with hundreds of authors, publishers and literary agents. He worked with such companies as Avon Books, Dell Publishing and Harper and Row (now HarperCollins), and then joined Warner Books as Director of Contracts where he stayed for 17 years. There, he met his wife, Jamie Raab, who is currently Publisher of Grand Central Books (formerly Warner Books). He was born in Waterloo, Iowa to Dwight Marion Dalrymple and Willa (Bette) Rasche, and grew up in Sarasota, Florida, before moving to New York City. Dennis loved New York City with the passion of a transplant, living first in Greenwich Village and in recent years on the Upper West Side. Mr. Dalrymple was a longtime anti-war activist who never met a war he wasn't prepared to protest. He was a founding member of the Youth International Party, its members known as Yippies, formed in 1967 by leftists and cultural icons Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner to radicalize hippie youth to protest the Vietnam War. He also nominated Pigasus the Pig for President at the 1968 convention. Mr. Dalrymple was an avid news junkie, an expert cook, a loyal friend, and, most of all, a devoted husband and father. Mr. Dalrymple is also survived by his sister, Sandra Scanlan; his stepmother, Marion Dalrymple; his four half sisters Jennifer Heit, Julie Rexford, Jere Gilbert and Jane Murphy. A memorial services will be held on Thursday, March 19th at 4 pm at Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square South in New York City."

He was an extraordinary man, who starting working at age 10, and put himself through high school and college at night. No job was too small or too demeaning if it enabled him to keep working and learning. When he wanted to get a job on Wall Street he went into the tallest building he could find, took the elevator to the top floor and started walking down, knocking on every door on every floor until he found a company that would hire him. He eventually went to Bear Stearns, starting as a runner, and ending as the head of its research department until he joined the Army in 1941. When the war was over stock market doldrums forced him to seek a career away from the Wall Street that he loved, and eventually, with his brother-in-law and a friend, he founded Greenwald Industries, which became the dominant manufacturer of coin meters for laundromats, and revolutionized that industry. Financial success enabled him to do what he enjoyed the most-helping his extended family and friends, not just with a check, but with jobs, business opportunities, education and any way he could find to put them in a position to lead fruitful lives. It didn't matter if it was his family or his wife's, first cousins, second cousins, or relatives by marriage, Lou's generosity knew no bounds. For him, family was everything. His greatest pleasure was to be with as many members of his family as possible at Passover Seders and other celebrations and all who attended basked in his joy and radiant smile and felt privileged to share these moments with him. He had a special place in his heart for his beloved Molly, his wife for 66 years as she did for him. Even when he was ill his face would light up whenever she walked into the room, and family and friends who came to visit almost always found them sitting together, still holding hands and touching each other with the same affection and love they shared for almost seven decades. Lou was a role model to all who knew him. He craved success only so that he could provide for his family and help others. He was never envious of the success of others, and never said an unkind word about anyone, being gracious and complimentary to everyone he met. He filled a special, and irreplaceable, niche in the hearts of his family and friends and will be missed but not forgotten. We will remember his every act of integrity, compassion, courage and sacrifice that enriched, encouraged or empowered others and we will try to emulate his example.

After WWII he joined the professional staff of New York's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center where he became a dedicated Professor of Medicine until his retirement in 1979.

Rockefeller III, Robert Moses, Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, among others. Not only is Lou survived by his wife and two sons, but also by his sister, Gert Wolfe, and four grandchildren.

Outside FedEx Forum before the South Regional semifinals, a couple of men were having a friendly argument. One said he knew how the other felt. He was a Duke fan, he said, and his team lost, too. But the other said there was no comparison. Everyone knew Duke was an inflated second seed with no chance to win the national title, he argued. Memphis was a No. 2 that many considered one of the best teams in the country. And with Connecticut distracted by illicit recruiting allegations, the thinking went, the West Region was there for the taking for Memphis."

He was an extraordinary man, who starting working at age 10, and put himself through high school and college at night. No job was too small or too demeaning if it enabled him to keep working and learning. When he wanted to get a job on Wall Street he went into the tallest building he could find, took the elevator to the top floor and started walking down, knocking on every door on every floor until he found a company that would hire him. He eventually went to Bear Stearns, starting as a runner, and ending as the head of its research department until he joined the Army in 1941. When the war was over stock market doldrums forced him to seek a career away from the Wall Street that he loved, and eventually, with his brother-in-law and a friend, he founded Greenwald Industries, which became the dominant manufacturer of coin meters for laundromats, and revolutionized that industry. Financial success enabled him to do what he enjoyed the most-helping his extended family and friends, not just with a check, but with jobs, business opportunities, education and any way he could find to put them in a position to lead fruitful lives. It didn't matter if it was his family or his wife's, first cousins, second cousins, or relatives by marriage, Lou's generosity knew no bounds. For him, family was everything. His greatest pleasure was to be with as many members of his family as possible at Passover Seders and other celebrations and all who attended basked in his joy and radiant smile and felt privileged to share these moments with him. He had a special place in his heart for his beloved Molly, his wife for 66 years as she did for him. Even when he was ill his face would light up whenever she walked into the room, and family and friends who came to visit almost always found them sitting together, still holding hands and touching each other with the same affection and love they shared for almost seven decades. Lou was a role model to all who knew him. He craved success only so that he could provide for his family and help others. He was never envious of the success of others, and never said an unkind word about anyone, being gracious and complimentary to everyone he met. He filled a special, and irreplaceable, niche in the hearts of his family and friends and will be missed but not forgotten. We will remember his every act of integrity, compassion, courage and sacrifice that enriched, encouraged or empowered others and we will try to emulate his example. Contributions may be made in Mr. Wolff's honor to American Friends of Matan, 75 Seckle Pear Road, Levittown, PA 19056. His Family"

2009-03-29T00:00:00Z,"DOMESTIC DISTURBANCES It's hard to write about, even admit to, simple happiness. It feels somehow indecent. Embarrassing. Immodest. Inappropriate as a topic of conversation for intelligent people. What I'm trying to get at is, I suppose, some variation of Tolstoy's observation about happy families, which always makes for a nicely quotable sentence but is, perhaps, wrong. Perhaps happiness is interesting, because it isn't, in fact, simple or uncomplicated. Perhaps the real thing isn't just a Hallmark card sentiment. For me, I realized in that moment, happiness is inextricably bound up in striving. In straining for achievement, of whatever kind. In having a challenge and making it to the other side. It doesn't much matter what the challenge or object of achievement is. If none is obvious, one always presents itself."

BEHIND THE NEWS The board said a looming $1.2 billion budget deficit left it no choice. But the real aim of the proposals was to rattle state political leaders enough to break an impasse over a rescue for the M.T.A. The governor and Assembly leaders have a plan for a much smaller fare increase and no service cuts, but it would add tolls on East River bridges that are now free, an idea facing resistance in the State Senate."

A creative force in New York media for almost 40 years in radio, advertising and finally the ABC network, Mr. Cohen was also a master of many poetic styles: the sonnet, the epic and the limerick, leaving many witty and well-loved examples. His 1942 wartime wedding, a story of lost love found and the stunts pulled to get married on the same day he shipped out, inspired a Judy Garland film, The Clock. The movie was based on a story by Paul Gallico, to whom he had recounted his travails when they met during WWII. After the war, Mr. Cohen worked in radio and advertising before joining ABC in 1961 and rising eventually to Vice President of Special Projects. To everything he worked on, he brought intelligence, innovation and wit. His beloved wife of 55 years, Dorothy Quaintance Cohen, passed away in October 1997.

''I'm in Botswana three months out of the year, working for the Livingstone Mission Center. But my husband had never been to Africa, so he went for the holidays. And it was the first time I had been there in their summer, so everything was different because it's so green. It was a neat experience for me as well. The animals and everything are great, but the thing that blows me away is the culture of Africa. It's definitely very real and tangible. Everything's more difficult: for example, it's very common for them to walk a couple of miles to get to their destination. But when you're walking a mile to get somewhere, which I have done in Africa many times, you feel your surroundings. There's more of a fullness of life. When you're in America and you're driving in your car, you can't even remember buildings that you pass by most of the time. In Africa, you see everything.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

The singer’s effort to adopt 4-year-old Mercy James from the southern African country could be opposed by some human rights groups, who were critical of Madonna’s adoption of her Malawian son, David Banda.

One of Madonna’s lawyers said, in comments outside the courtroom, that the singer was asking the court to grant her an interim adoption of about 18 months.

The coming “Star Trek” film, directed by J.J. Abrams (“Lost,” “Alias”) and scheduled to open on May 8, returns to the earliest adventures of Kirk, Spock and McCoy as young recruits of the Starfleet Academy. That film is written by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (“Fringe,” “Transformers”), and produced by Damon Lindelof, a creator and executive producer of “Lost;” all will be writing and producing the planned sequel.

The struggling if well-regarded show about a fictitious Texas school and its star athletes, adapted from the Buzz Bissinger nonfiction book and the 2004 feature film, has been on the brink of cancellation before; a third season of the series was picked up in 2008 only after the satellite broadcaster DirecTV agreed to help finance it. The new seasons of “Friday Night Lights,” each 13 episodes long, will also be jointly financed by DirecTV and the shows will have their premiere there before they are on NBC.

The proposed rules would let local governments avoid repaying some or all of their loans if their revenues for three fiscal years since the disasters had not met operating costs. Debt forgiveness would not be automatic, meaning communities would have to apply for the relief and meet established criteria. The Federal Emergency Management Agency made available nearly $1.3 billion in loans to communities in Louisiana and Mississippi after the 2005 hurricanes devastated the region. As of March 16, $831 million in loan money had been drawn down. FEMA had no estimate on how much of the loaned money might be forgiven. In 2007, Congress authorized the agency to forgive the loans under certain conditions. But the proposed rules were the first specific steps moving that process forward."

2009-03-31T00:00:00Z,"LOOMIS--Chauncey Chester Jr. of Stockbridge, MA died from cancer at Fairview Hospital in Great Barrington, MA on March 17, 2009. He was born on June 1, 1930 in New York to the late Chauncey and Elizabeth McLanahan Loomis. His older brothers John (Jack) and Stanley Loomis died before him. He attended the Stockbridge Public Schools, Phillips Exeter Academy, Princeton University (A.B. '52, Ph.D.) and Columbia University (M.A.). Before attending Columbia, Chauncey enlisted in the US Army and served during the Korean conflict. After finishing school, Chauncey briefly taught English at the University of Vermont, then in 1963 moved to Dartmouth College. He retired from Dartmouth as Professor of English in 1997. In 1968, Chauncey led an expedition investigating the mysterious death of the early American explorer Charles Francis Hall, who was buried in Northern Greenland during an unsuccessful attempt to reach the North Pole. That trip resulted in Chauncey's book, Weird and Tragic Shores, recently republished by the Modern Library in the Expedition Series and which became the basis for a PBS documentary. He wrote many book reviews and articles including his innovative consideration of arctic landscapes in his essay ""Arctic Sublime"", published in the book Nature and the Victorian Imagination. Throughout his life, Chauncey followed his passion for exploration, conservation, photography and fly fishing. He filmed musk oxen off the coast of Alaska, searched for lost Inca civilizations in Peru, and caught (and mostly released) trout and salmon on many continents. He was always involved in his various communities and served on the boards of local and national institutions including the Housatonic Valley Association, Phillips Exeter Academy, the Hotchkiss School, the Norman Rockwell Museum, and Chesterwood. Chauncey is survived by his nephew Craig Loomis, a grand-niece Vivian Loomis, step-niece Claudine Scoville, step-nephews Reg Gignoux, Tom Gignoux, and Thayer Gignoux, and their children Denny, Simone, Alex, Christopher and Madeleine Gignoux. For all his protestations, he was welcoming and generous; he taught us much about thinking and living, about honesty and kindness. A memorial service for Chauncey Loomis will be held at the Norman Rockwell Museum, Stockbridge, Massachusetts on May 9th, at 4pm. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests memorial gifts may be made to the Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation at 271 Main Street, Great Barrington, MA 01230. Please specify the Chauncey Loomis Fund; this is a fund established by Chauncey to help Berkshire County, MA high school students attend college."

A longtime resident of Rowayton, Shelley was 86 years old. Shelley was born in New York City on July 10, 1922, to Israel and Sarah Trubowitz, who immigrated to the United States from Lithuania. Known affectionately as ""Mookie,"" Shelley grew up in Brooklyn, along with his brother Sidney and sister Frummie (Florence). He attended Erasmus Hall High School and later Indiana University, where he received his B.A. Upon graduation Shelley joined the Army, serving as a TSgt. and medic in the elite World War II fighting force known as Merrill's Marauders, which fought in the jungles of Burma. After the war, Shelley opted for a career in dentistry, receiving his D.D.S. in 1950 from New York University. The following year he moved to Rowayton and shortly thereafter, married Jacqueline Vida Loeb. A distinguished maxillofacial prosthodontist, Shelley ran a successful private practice in Rowayton and was a member of the faculty at Yale New Haven Medical Center and New York University College of Dentistry. Among colleagues, Shelley was known for his clinical skills. He gave productive life back to many, many head and neck cancer victims with his elegant reconstructive, maxillofacial and orbital prostheses. Patients from Fairfield Country and beyond relied instinctively on his skill and judgment. Shelley loved life. A terrific dancer, few things gave him greater pleasure than a dance floor, a big band, and a lithe partner. He was also an avid tennis player, who with Ward Chamberlin, took home Rowayton's men's doubles trophy multiple times. A competitive swimmer from college days, Shelley often swam Rowayton's annual quarter-mile buoy race and like Rowayton's other noble ""high tiders,"" was a regular at Bayley Beach. He is survived by his older brother and his sister-in-law, Dr. Sidney Trubowitz and Ethel Mason Trubowitz; his former wife, Jackie; seven children -- Peter, Charles, Jonathon, Seth, Amy, Phoebe, and Mitchell and their spouses; twenty healthy, boisterous grandchildren; and four nieces and a nephew and their families. Shelley's funeral will be held in Savannah March 31. A memorial service will be scheduled for later this spring in Rowayton. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to the Rowayton Civic Association (RCA) in memory of Shelley H. Trubowitz, PO Box 302, Rowayton, Connecticut 06853."

Mr. Newsted, who was hired by Metallica in 1986 to replace Cliff Burton, who died in a tour bus accident, said he had received the invitation to reunite with his old band mates from the drummer Lars Ulrich. “He said, ‘We want you to rock with us,'” Mr. Newsted told Billboard.

That plan was given the go-ahead, but was later redesigned as a giant pyramid covered in bricks, and had to be resubmitted to a London borough council for approval.

The reason is similar, for the consequences last decades. When a child is severely malnourished, the result is often a cognitive impairment that will last the entire life. And when a child is forced to drop out of school, he or she probably won't go back and will never become literate. That's a burden on the country that will linger for the next half a century."

2009-04-01T14:15:54Z,"E.B White once said that driving to Maine teaches you to spell moccasin. I feel sort of the same about the arrival of spring and forsythia. It's been a hard spring, though, for many people. Eventually you know someone who has lost his or her job. A small part of me bristles when I see an article declaring ""the end of excess,"" because I know that lots of intelligent people already do live modestly by choice if not necessity. So who is the lecture for? Over the next year or two, the fashion industry will be significantly altered, as will coverage of the industry in glossy magazines and newspapers, which are experiencing their own traumas. If people are being more careful about what they buy, it seems to me they will also be picky about what they choose to read. What things will matter to people without trivializing the seriousness of the economy or, at the same time, being a complete downer browner and forgetting that fashion is a source of pleasure? It's also a livelihood for millions of people."

2009-04-01T00:00:00Z,"BERGSON--Maria, died peacefully on Thursday, March 19th after a long illness. She was born in Vienna in 1914. After a brief but successful career in the theater working with Max Reinhardt, she came to America in 1940 and found a job as secretary and research assistant in the offices of Architectural Forum, a part of Time Inc. After the Managing Editor expressed unhappiness with her office layout, Maria suggested that it was ""...because the designers have not paid attention to how you work."" When challenged to propose something better, she redesigned that office, and then subsequently the offices of Time Inc. itself, and the firm of Maria Bergson Associates (MBA) was born. MBA revolutionized commercial office design. The old roll-top desk was replaced by interchangeable components forming work surfaces resting on different file cabinets, and her many innovations were publicized by Fortune Magazine in 1946. The firm's reputation continued to grow over a long period of time, and its business flourished with offices in New York, Los Angeles and London. In time she did work for many banks, but also for major companies in virtually all well-known industries. She even designed the Admiral's suite and the crew quarters of the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier, the Independence. Maria Bergson's family, who had all also left Vienna, were extremely important to her, and throughout her life she went to extraordinary lengths helping generations of her relatives. She is survived by her husband of 67 years, Thomas L. Brunner, and various nephews, grandnephews and grandnieces. There will be a service at 3:00pm on Friday April 3rd, at Frank E.

2009-04-02T12:30:48Z,"Over the years, the key roles in “Bye Bye Birdie” have been played by their share of sexpots (Chita Rivera, Ann-Margret) and squares (Dick Van Dyke). Guess which route Roundabout Theater Company is taking for its latest revival of the musical? In a release, Roundabout said that it had cast John Stamos (of Broadway’s “Nine” and “Cabaret” and, of course, “Full House”) and Gina Gershon (of “Showgirls”) to play the roles of Albert Peterson, the publicity-seeking songwriter, and Rose Alvarez, his doting assistant. The new production, which is to be directed and choreographed by Robert Longbottom, has also cast Bill Irwin (soon to be seen in “Waiting For Godot”) as Mr. MacAfee and Jayne Houdyshell as Mrs. Peterson. The revival of “Bye Bye Birdie,” the first to play Broadway since its 1961 premiere, is scheduled for the fall."

2009-04-02T14:09:39Z,"A ruling by the city council of Vienna has set a new standard for the restitution of artworks seized during the era when Austria was under Nazi rule, Reuters reported. This week the council voted to return the painting “Pappenheim’s Death” by Hans Makart to the heirs of Herbert Gutmann, a Jewish banker who fled to Britain in 1936 after selling his art collection and other possessions. The painting, which eventually turned up in the collection of the Museum of Vienna, was sold at auction in 1934; current Austrian restitution law covers only the years between 1938 and 1945. Andreas Mailath-Pokorny, the Vienna city councilman for culture, said that the council had “a moral obligation” to overrule the time frame of existing restitution law, according to Reuters."
2009-04-02T15:20:16Z,"I’ve got a piece in today’s paper that takes a broad view of “Damages”’ second season (which I really enjoyed) but thought the season finale Wednesday night had enough noteworthy moments to keep the conversation going. Obviously Patty’s visit to see Daniel Purcell in prison, on top of all that dream-scape call to self-reckoning, had a pretty big impact on her. She looks at him as though he is insane for confessing to his wife’s murder and then eventually we see her at work deciding to pursue the last-ditch road to honorably winning her case against Walter Kendrick and U.N.R. as if suddenly we were all watching Perry Mason. (I need to nit-pick here. When Patty goes to see the show’s in-house Cocaine Addicted Wall Street Trader, Finn Garrity, she tells him that “thousands” of people have died at the hands of U.N.R’s toxic pollution. Was she making a rhetorical point or an actual one? How many people live in West Virginia anyway?)"

2009-04-02T00:00:00Z,"BERGSON--Maria, died peacefully on Thursday, March 19th after a long illness. She was born in Vienna in 1914. After a brief but successful career in the theater working with Max Reinhardt, she came to America in 1940 and found a job as secretary and research assistant in the offices of Architectural Forum, a part of Time Inc. After the Managing Editor expressed unhappiness with her office layout, Maria suggested that it was ""...because the designers have not paid attention to how you work."" When challenged to propose something better, she redesigned that office, and then subsequently the offices of Time Inc. itself, and the firm of Maria Bergson Associates (MBA) was born. MBA revolutionized commercial office design. The old roll-top desk was replaced by interchangeable components forming work surfaces resting on different file cabinets, and her many innovations were publicized by Fortune Magazine in 1946. The firm's reputation continued to grow over a long period of time, and its business flourished with offices in New York, Los Angeles and London. In time she did work for many banks, but also for major companies in virtually all well-known industries. She even designed the Admiral's suite and the crew quarters of the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier, the Independence. Maria Bergson's family, who had all also left Vienna, were extremely important to her, and throughout her life she went to extraordinary lengths helping generations of her relatives. She is survived by her husband of 67 years, Thomas L. Brunner, and various nephews, grandnephews and grandnieces. There will be a service at 3:00pm on Friday April 3rd, at Frank E.

The attack was the first of its kind in the Orakzai region, which lies southwest of Peshawar and close to the border with Afghanistan, residents said."
2009-04-02T00:00:00Z,"LACROSSE, derived from a game played by American Indians, is among the fastest-growing sports in the country. Participation by young players grew by 500 percent from 1999 to 2007, according to the most recent survey by US Lacrosse. That growth is reflected among boys and girls in high school, men and women in college (the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I men's final drew 48,970 fans to Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., last May to see Syracuse defeat Johns Hopkins) and in the presence of indoor and outdoor professional leagues. With that swelling popularity comes an appetite and expectation for new and improved equipment. The newest lacrosse gloves, smaller than ice hockey gloves but bigger and with more padding than a pair of puffy Gore-Tex mittens, are about protection and flexibility -- with a dash of flash thrown in for good measure -- and, of course, sales. Some of them look like something out of ''RoboCop.''"

And among the better-received books for fledgling readers has been “Tiny Titans,” a young-ified version of the Teen Titans team staffed by Robin, Kid Flash and other superhero sidekicks, and which enters our paperback list at no. 8. “Tiny Titans is the best book out there – that doesn’t bog you down in continuity, has no serious side, and is great for all ages. This isn’t published frequently enough!!” wrote one fan on www.newsarama.com. Older comic book fans who want to see “tiny” versions of a lot of Titans and other DC heroes should check out the Web site of Art Baltazar, the book’s artist."
2009-04-03T11:00:07Z,"John Updike’s publisher recently asked me to read the audiobook version of “Endpoint,” his last book of poems. This is a task that Updike, who was a superb reader of his own work, would have undertaken for himself had he lived, and I was apprehensive about stepping in for him. My only qualifications, if you can call them that, are that I knew Updike and that I used to read a lot to my kids. From years of fidgeting and nodding off during poetry readings, though, I know just how hard it is to read verse well. Moreover, Updike wrote many of the poems in “Endpoint” while literally on his deathbed. They’re heartbreakingly sad, and I wasn’t sure I could get through them without blubbing. In the end, I didn’t, quite, though the poem that undid me was not one of the hospital meditations but “Peggy Lutz, Fred Muth,” which is a thank-you note and a farewell to his hometown, Shillington, Pa., and his high-school classmates, who he says gave him all the world he needed to write about. What’s touching is the poem’s generosity, and its rueful suggestion that maybe we find heaven at the beginning of our lives and not at the end."

2009-04-03T10:35:37Z,"The BBC has been fined by an independent regulator for a controversial prank call that was broadcast in October and perpetrated by the comedians Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross, The Associated Press reported. The Office of Communications fined the BBC about $219,000 for the incident, which occurred during a radio show hosted by Mr. Brand, when he and Mr. Ross left a series of lewd messages on the answering machine of the actor Andrew Sachs. In the ensuing controversy, which became known as Sachsgate, the BBC received thousands of complaints from listeners and was criticized by Prime Minster Gordon Brown. Mr. Brand, the star of “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” and author of “My Booky Wook,” resigned from his show, and Mr. Ross was suspended from television and radio for 12 weeks."
2009-04-03T11:30:26Z,"Sotheby’s has canceled the sale of an artifact believed to be a valuable Muslim relic after questions were raised about its authenticity, Reuters reported. In April 2008, Sotheby’s sold at auction in London a key believed to have been made in the 12th century and used to unlock the holy Kaaba, a sacred Islamic shrine in Mecca. At that time, the item sold for nearly $13.5 million, more than 18 times its pre-sale estimate. The Art Newspaper said that the key was brought to the British Museum about two weeks after the sale, where experts raised “serious doubts” about its age. In a statement, Sotheby’s said, “In light of the divergence of academic views, Sotheby’s and the consignor decided to cancel the sale in May 2008, pending further research and scientific analysis,” according to Reuters. The key has been returned to its original owner."
2009-04-03T12:30:57Z,"Anthony Lucki, chief executive of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the educational and trade publisher that has lately struggled financially, has announced he will retire on April 15. Mr. Lucki, 60, had worked with Harcourt for 25 years before it was merged with Houghton Mifflin in 2007. Education Media and Publishing Group, an Irish private equity concern, first bought Houghton Mifflin three years ago and then Harcourt the following year. Barry O’Callaghan, chairman of Education Media and its largest shareholder, will assume the role of chief executive at Houghton. The company, which is one of the country’s largest publishers of textbooks for the K-12 market, also operates a trade publisher whose authors include Philip Roth and Günter Grass. Last month, Education Media said that after entertaining several bids for the trade and reference division of Houghton Mifflin, it would not be selling it. Education Media is currently shouldering $7 billion in debt. A company spokesman said the company expects to restructure its balance sheets in the next 60 to 90 days to lighten the debt load."
2009-04-03T12:00:54Z,"Bollywood film producers were expected to go on strike Saturday after failing to arrive at a revenue-sharing agreement with movie theater owners, BBC News reported. Indian film producers are threatening to stop making new movies if they do not receive a 50 percent share of the revenue raised by multi-screen movie theaters; theater owners say that producers stand to make a disproportionate share of revenues, and that they will continue to show older films on their screens until the dispute is resolved. The BBC said that the $2 billion a year Indian film industry now earns as much as 70 percent of its revenue from multi-screen theaters. In October, Indian film and television production was briefly brought to a halt when a leading Bollywood union of actors, writers and technicians went on strike, demanding better working conditions."

Nixon said as he walked to the door to meet President de Gaulle at the bottom of the plane's steps.

2009-04-03T16:30:16Z,"A couple of months ago I had the great honor to go to the West African capital of Bamako, Mali, to collaborate on a photo shoot with the renowned Malian photographer Malick Sidibe. I have admired Sidibe's work for a long time, and the idea for the shoot (which is featured in the style section of this Sunday's New York Times Magazine and online) was to dress the models (Sidibe's extended family, including many of his 17 sons and daughters) in a mix of the printed and often African-inspired clothes from the spring collections. When it came time for the actual shoot, I started selecting combinations of models for the shots and getting people dressed. Instead of the usual hundreds and hundreds of frames per shot that I had become accustomed to in this era of digital photography, Sidibe took only two or three frames for every shot. When the shoot was over, he had only shot 22 frames on his Rolleiflex! Sidibe has an infectious smile and doles out his words of wisdom to those who come to visit him at his studio in the Bagadadji neighborhood of Bamako. Below are his typically off-the-cuff responses to a few questions I sent him via e-mail after the shoot. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words."

2009-04-04T11:26:46Z,"Re ""Bad News, and More Bad News"" (March 15): Not being a 5-year-old child anymore, I'd much rather hear the truth (however grim) than a fairy tale (however rosy and upbeat).So let The Times continue to tell it like it is. Until we know, in full, what's happening, we won't be able to tell what's wrong, much less how to counteract it.I think that people who object to The Times's reporting of the whole picture are mostly those who don't want the rest of us to put two and two together and come up with four equals Bush.Tamara P. DuvallLexington, Va., March 15, 2009 ● I usually read your column with interest, if not always with agreement. But I am, after all, a consenting adult and know what I am letting myself in for when I read the Op-Ed pages of The Times. But today's column touched bottom in a way that the economy probably hasn't yet done.You excuse Peter S. Goodman, a national economics correspondent, for his use of the word ""depression"" in a way that strains belief. First, you quote him as saying, ""My master is reality."" What sort of reality is he referring to? I would hope he means an evidence-based reality, but support for his reality takes the form of the ""Nine out of 10 dentists recommend Crest"" advertisement - true if you pick the right 10 dentists.In Mr. Goodman's case, he refers to ""two respected economists"" - an easier group to assemble even than the 10 dentists - but one does worry about who is doing the respecting. These two economists volunteered, ""in separate interviews"" (that's important, since it implies no collusion on their part), that the use of the word ""depression"" was allowable (for the Mark Zandi quote) on the grounds that ""the odds of a 'mild depression' were up to 25 percent.""This is ambiguous. It might mean that the odds had now increased to 25 percent (one in four, presumably), having previously been lower, or that those odds were now less than or equal to 25 percent, in which case one should ask, ""How much less than 25 percent could that mean?"" Which of these interpretations was implied?On top of this, the other economist, Allen Sinai, saw a 20 percent chance of a ""depressionlike possibility,"" which does tend to boggle one's mind a bit. Since a 20 percent chance is a 20 percent possibility, he sees the possibility of a possibility that resembles a depression.On these two opinions does Mr. Goodman justify himself, and you support him! Really!Anthony PoëOttawa, March 15, 2009 ● While I agree that it is not the responsibility of the news media to be a cheerleader, or to falsely represent that things are better than they perceive them to be, I think that you missed a bigger point.No one can deny that much of what is happening in this economy is psychologically driven. The psychology of a market will drive it up (think ""bubbles""), and it can, as is now happening, drive a market down.I think the point is that reporting in the present situation implies that the ""bad news"" is independent of the personal decisions of the public. The result is that people react to the bad news, creating a cycle that becomes self-fulfilling.You should do an in-depth study focused on how many people are sitting on the sidelines waiting for the ""bottom"" to then get back into the market (whether it be housing, stocks, business expansions, startups, etc).I don't doubt that the bad news is real. I just think that the element of how the bad news in and of itself creates a downward spiral is missing from the coverage.Bruce GorenLos Angeles, March 15, 2009 ● I think The Times needs to tell it like it is and not sugarcoat things because there are those who want something less than the truth.I think The Times does a fine job! I do think, however, that The Times, and the media in general, did less than a fine job of sounding the warning and challenging the Bush administration on the thinking and events leading up to war in Iraq. Everyone was going easy on telling the truth because of the public mood and for fear of losing advertising dollars.We must not repeat that mistake again. A free society cannot exist without newspapers that tell the truth.Larry A. DeyssDelmar, N.Y., March 16, 2009●●Re ""Those Persistent Anonymous Sources"" (March 22): Since you indicate that some critics of anonymous sources were themselves insisting on anonymity, let me help with comments that are on the record:In every job I have had in 45 years of journalism, from PBS to CBS News to Westinghouse (later the same company) to ABC to NPR and even as far back as college radio, anonymous sources have done their best to obscure and mislead to serve their own (or their bosses') interests, hiding disinformation behind a cloak of anonymity. Best is to treat them just as you would treat an anonymous letter: that is where reporting should start, not stop.When I was head of NPR News, over and over again anonymous sources attempted to manipulate us in all of the usual ways. But when I insisted that NPR reporters try to get sources to go on the record, in every case - every case - the story was strengthened.For example, the anonymous source's criticisms of the F.B.I. were, stripped of anonymity, then confirmed by the F.B.I. itself. That made it a better story, no?Another anonymous source's accusations about a Supreme Court nominee were, when pressed, eventually confirmed by the judge himself - and before our deadline that afternoon. Better, don't you think?And a classic election-eve anonymous source unloading a late hit against a presidential candidate was unmasked when his information, just too good to be true, was in fact, as usual, too good to check out (which is not to say that others don't fall for that clichéd gambit).When I was a reporter, when my editors asked me to go back to my sources to insist they go on the record, my sources either relented or showed how I could document their information by other means. After all, the reason they become sources is (in almost all cases) to get the story published, right?Four decades of journalism have convinced me that anonymous sources are almost never needed. Rather, they have become the crack cocaine of the newsroom, peddled everywhere for a quick hit. It's time to break the habit.Adam Clayton Powell IIIHong Kong, March 26, 2009 ●Some of the stories by the sources you cite would be inadmissible in a trial, being mostly gossip or uncorroborated.You mention 2004 as the time that this policy was adopted. I think back to stories in The Times that helped drum up the war pre-2004. And, of course, the story that Robert D. Novak let out was and still is, I think, criminal.I've been a lifelong reader of The Times, but I don't put much faith is today's so-called journalists caring much about ""the truth."" Filling space and time 24/7 seems the primary need of news organizations. I have to trust my own radar to delete the gossip, misleading statements and downright lies I read and hear.J. T. HollandWashington, March 22, 2009 ● There are questionable ethics involved when The Times publishes statements by officials who request anonymity ""because they are not authorized to comment publicly."" These officials are breaking the rules and perhaps even the law, and The Times, by publishing their comments, is abetting them. Perhaps you could comment on this in a future column.Jim LincolnConcord, Mass., March 22, 2009 ● As a reporter who covered Washington for more than 30 years, I am increasingly annoyed by the nonattribution explanations that slow up reading The Times and other papers.Why should I care that a source was ""not authorized to speak to the press""? What I care about is the information provided by the source. What I rely on is not the identity of a source but the reputation of the reporter whose byline appears on the story and the reputation for accuracy of the newspaper that publishes the report. When I was covering the Pentagon for The Washington Star and U.S. News & World Report, almost everything worth knowing was secret or above. Of course my sources for such information were anonymous, often to the chagrin of secretaries of defense and other officials who wanted to know: ""How did he know that?""Often, there was no single ""source"" at all. Reporters covering such a Byzantine place as the Pentagon get a bit of information here and another there, putting them together into a revealing story. When I went to one source with what I thought was the basis for a story, he would tell me: ""No, that's not right. Now, if you asked me . . . I would say that's classified and I can't talk about it.""My non-source was thus in a position, if asked, to say truthfully that he told me he couldn't talk about that subject while, of course, he had steered me in the right direction. I know The Times and other papers have been burned by reporters who simply lied about sources or were misled by trusted sources. But the answer to that problem is not silly rules that simply slow up the reader, but the hiring of reporters and editors of the highest integrity.Orr KellyBethesda, Md., March 22, 2009● While there are certainly times when anonymity is needed or deserved, as you point out, lately the reference to those sources seems to be used too often. And that makes one wonder whether there is really any basis to what is being reported.For instance, I read with great interest ""Love Was Blind,"" about Bank of America and Merrill Lynch (Business Day, Feb. 8) - until I hit the following paragraph: ""Interviews with almost 30 current and former Bank of America and Merrill executives and employees convey just how messy the merger has been. All of them asked not to be identified because they either did not have permission from the banks to speak or because they had signed confidentially agreements with their former employers.""Almost 30 people! All of whom spoke without authority to do so or broke their written word not to do so. At that point the reporters lost me. How could I believe the story when none of their almost 30 sources could be independently verified?John L. GoldmanRochester, March 23, 2009 ● Hats off to you for taking on the issue of anonymous sources. The difficulty of the challenge was obvious - again - in the very same issue in which your column appeared.At the end of a long business story about the so-called food revolution - hardly the kind of story that would seem to require cloak and dagger secrecy - ""a prominent food industry lobbyist who requested anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to reporters"" was mentioned.The earth-shattering revelation that justified this cover-up by the reporter? That the lobbyist was ""amazed"" to see many members of Congress carrying a best-selling book (""The Omnivore's Dilemma""). Secrecy won out in the business section on March 24, when Andrew Sorkin in the Dealbook column quotes ""one senior Goldman executive who insisted on not being quoted by name for fear of crossing the Treasury Department.""This in a newspaper that has constantly railed in recent months about the lack of transparency in the gargantuan financial industry bailout. Seems like the reporters and columnists are being permitted - maybe encouraged? - to be enablers of the very lack of transparency that they decry.There's little reason to think that the flood of unnamed sources will slow down much. But you shining a light on this problem at least makes the reporters and editors squirm a bit.Frank HamsherSt. Louis, March 24, 2009 ● It seems as though when discussing non-people facts, the source should be available and be willing to be quoted.When talking about opinion or theory, who cares about the source? The important aspect is for people to evaluate the message - not the messenger.All messengers are consciously or unconsciously biased anyway. And to a large extent the news media do no favors by substituting messenger evaluation for message evaluation.Paul F. HosmanKalamazoo, Mich., March 22, 2009 ● I enjoyed your column discussing the reasons informants are not identified.I've been fascinated by the endless number of explanations. I like the variety - there seems to be an obligation to come up with new excuses for granting anonymity. I particularly like it when explanations are at least somewhat factual - ""feared the consequences of identifying himself,"" ""did not have permission to speak"" or ""because of the sensitivity of the subject.""To be really factual, how about, ""We were afraid we would be sued,"" or ""The Editor is a coward""?Dick SherwoodSouth Dartmouth, Mass., March 22, 2009 ●One major problem with the practice of offering sources anonymity is that it is simply extraordinarily contagious. People read the paper, notice the prevalence of unnamed sources, and wonder why they should speak on the record when no one else does.The reasons for desiring to remain out of the spotlight in our increasingly polarized and dangerous society are entirely understandable. Newspaper reporters certainly have a daunting task of persuading people to speak on the record added to the chore of writing a thorough and fair piece, but if editors and publishers don't enforce standards with consistency, the whole enterprise becomes indistinguishable from gossip mongering.Think for a moment of newspapers' main competition - television newscasts.How often do we see TV relying on unidentified sources? Sure, once in a while we get the blurred face, anonymous silhouette, or distorted voice, but it's remarkably rare. If you want to provide information or comment on a TV news story, you not only get your name used, but you are usually photographed. Why can't print news make the same demands?Charles ClouseSanta Barbara, Calif., March 24, 2009 ● You write, ""The policy says anonymous sources should be used only as 'a last resort when the story is of compelling public interest and the information is not available any other way.'""Maybe if editors designated assignments in advance so that reporters knew which stories they would be covering would not be news of ""compelling public interest,"" the reporters would recognize that they simply could not get certain stories published with any anonymous sources.It also seems as if reporters covering compelling news should have to justify in writing their use of anonymous sources. They should have to explain at a minimum why anonymity is a last resort, efforts they have made to get the source on the record and how their investigation has led them to conclude that the information could not be obtained from another reliable open source.Although it may not always be possible, the reporter's pledge of anonymity should be given only after the reporter has obtained prior written approval from an editor, with that editor's written conclusions as to why anonymity is being granted.While forcing reporters and editors to document in writing the grant of anonymity in each case might be somewhat burdensome at first, it seems that if the procedures were put in place as regular expectations, both reporters and editors would adapt. It is also likely that both groups would become less willing to grant anonymity, except in extraordinary cases.As with the corrections page of The Times, it is possible that the newspaper could include a daily anonymous sourcing note, explaining in which story (or stories) anonymity had been granted and why.Patrick MattimoreGex, France, March 22, 2009 ● Consider this: A reporter quotes an anonymous source in an article and a lawsuit is filed, perhaps for defamation of character or false accusations. Should the reporter have to testify and name the anonymous source who gave the information that resulted in the lawsuit?Over the last 15 years, and even more so during the last 8, I believe there are a number of factors that contributed to the rise in the use of anonymous sources: (1) A real fear that making an accusation on the record could result in losing one's job or being ostracized by a community; (2) the fast pace at which news breaks means that reporters don't always have the time to look for other sources before writing a story; and (3) a general sense that citing an anonymous source adds credibility to any story.Unfortunately, the overall acceptance of anonymous source reporting means we have now found ourselves living in a culture where all one has to do is make an anonymous accusation or give an anonymous tip and it becomes fact in newsrooms around the world. No confirmation required. Lives and careers have been destroyed as a result of that policy.Rebekah JensenMorrisville, N.C., March 22, 2009●●Re ""No Comment. But You Didn't Hear It From Me"" (March 29): I hope that you will take a look at The Times's policies and practices in identifying ""people in the street"" in articles from places with repressive governments, particularly when they make critical comments.I have the impression that too often The New York Times relies on interviewees to request anonymity rather than expecting its reporters and/or editors to provide it, even if not requested, in potentially risky situations.The exact name of a noodle salesman in Shanghai really does not add enough to a story to justify putting his freedom or even life at risk.Minot NettletonWoodbridge, Conn., March 29, 2009 ● As a onetime ink-stained wretch and later a P.R. man, your column on anonymous sources and spokesmen grabbed me. I find objectionable the widespread use of aides or P.R. people as spokesmen for decision-makers. Whatever happened to the management maxim, ""The buck stops here""- the code that disapproved of leaders passing the buck down the line and shirking their duties?I was taught that the media-relations role of a P.R. person is as a liaison between management and the press: to arrange for a reporter to speak directly to the person responsible for the part of the organization in which the reporter is interested.Management people are often reluctant to speak to the press and prefer to hide behind a spokesman. Fortunately, my boss accepted my perspective and, as C.E.O., was able to insist that except for requests for commonplace information, appropriate managers, not P.R. people, speak with reporters.Hal HoldenNorth Vancouver, British Columbia, March 29, 2009 ● I don't want to know why anonymous quotes are unattributed or off the record. That answer is usually vague, vacuous and formulaic, and provides no useful context or resulting import.I want to know why these sources are talking. Every reporter should ask this every time. ""Why are you telling me this?"" That's the context I need to understand the information (spin?) that sources are providing.Yes, in many (most) cases you'll get hand-waving and fatuity. And in many cases the reporter knows the answer perfectly well already. But your readers don't.And if reporters don't ask the question, they are quite reasonably precluded from imputing the source's motive(s) in print. This leaves your readers to do that imputing (and they will do so) absent the context necessary to do so.If the question is asked - and pressed - every time, it could have some small effect on the culture of anonymity. Sources might have to actually ask themselves the question. Even if they spin the answer, they might not be able to do so with complete success. (Think: reporters' Spidey senses.) In some cases, the source's answer would provide a necessary context or frame or lens through which I can discern the true import of what is being reported and quoted. The source's statements, so framed, might take on a significantly different or even opposite meaning. In some cases, the frame is the story.Over time the pressure of the question being consistently asked and pressed - and the answer being reported - could result in a salutary change to the overly cozy culture in whose talons reporters so often find themselves pinioned.Steve RothSeattle, March 30, 2009"

Which means that the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the home of the New York Mets both survived as major league venues for just 45 seasons. The coincidence is compelling because those two ballparks seem like partners these days, with Ebbets Field serving as the architectural, and even emotional, inspiration for Citi Field and Shea still fresh in people's minds as the imperfect place the Mets played imperfect baseball."
2009-04-04T00:00:00Z,"Ever since Michelle Obama departed for Europe with her husband, taking along a wardrobe of designer clothes and revealing a new hairdo, her meeting with Carla Sarkozy, the wife of the French president, had been anticipated as a fashion face-off between two stylish first ladies. Their meeting on Friday, at the Palais Rohan in Strasbourg, France, was not quite that. Indeed, Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Sarkozy looked remarkably similar, suggesting that both women know fashion -- and themselves -- pretty well. Each wore a coat with a soft bow at the neck and low-heeled shoes. Mrs. Sarkozy's gray lambskin coat was a Dior, while Mrs. Obama's Jacquard silk coat was by the American designer Thakoon Panichgul, as was her short-sleeved fuchsia dress."

Doing so will require overcoming bureaucratic obstacles and harmonizing state and federal mandates. And that will mean intervention by the White House, specifically Carol Browner, the president's coordinator on energy and environmental matters, whose job description includes unraveling just this kind of knot."

Ten years after the release of their last recording of new material, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, perhaps the most innovative Spanish-language rock group of the 1990s, are back: on the road, playing in stadiums; on MTV again; and with a new CD. In fact, the only real surprise about the return of the Cadillacs, who are scheduled to play on Sunday at the Hammerstein Ballroom, may be that they dropped out of sight in the first place. This Argentine band was at the peak of its popularity in Latin America and building a following in the United States when it simply stopped recording and then touring. There were no visible signs of internal squabbling, no announcement of a breakup or even of a timeout, just a sudden silence."

When drafting plans in January to spend roughly $800 billion to stimulate the deteriorating economy, the Obama administration operated on the assumption that the unemployment rate would reach 8.9 percent by the end of the year -- without the extra federal spending. Three months into the year, the unemployment rate has already soared to 8.5 percent, from 7.6 percent, the highest level in more than a quarter-century."

It turns out the country built too many restaurants, too. Now consumers are cutting back, and dining out is among the casualties.

History -- the Mets' first home run at Citi Field -- seemed a few seconds away, and Fernando Tatis, the answer to that trivia question, tagged first base and followed the ball's trajectory. Rather than landing in the seats, the ball ricocheted three-quarters of the way up the 15-foot wall, a good 400 feet away, and Tatis stopped at second. Nine outs into the Mets' inaugural game at Citi Field, a rain-delayed 4-3 victory against the Boston Red Sox, and a preliminary answer to their new ballpark's most pressing riddle -- how will it play? -- had emerged. The definitive verdict will not come for at least another few months, after the temperature changes and wind patterns are tracked, but the learning process had begun for Tatis and the Mets."

But in recent years some writers and economists have been telling a version of this story that is quite different from the one generally taught in school or seen on the History Channel. In this interpretation Roosevelt is a well-meaning but misguided dupe who not only prolonged the Depression but also exacerbated it.
