If it cannot go it loves the sport just the same, and that same love rests in England's dependencies, whether in Canada, Australia, India, South Africa, Jamaica, or Egypt. So tales of the turf have always had a vogue among the Britishers that seem a bit mysterious to other peoples."

When he has finished reading the book the reader has the feeling that he has met a number of men and women, all more or less uninteresting and rather stupid.

There is something grimly humorous in the way in which the various departments, prominently the Board of Trade, from time to time issue tables of statistics fatal to protectionist theories.

1904-09-29T00:00:00Z,"There is a touch of naivete in the Pope's official complaint of the Congress of Freethinkers at Rome. Why, in effect he pathetically inquires, should these people meet, of all places, in the place ""near"" which, in the language of diplomacy, is the Holy See and headquarters of the faith once delivered to the saints?"

1904-09-29T00:00:00Z,"There is always a comic side to the trade wars which a big nation finds itself compelled to wage against a little nation.

1904-09-30T00:00:00Z,It would probably be a waste of time seriously to discuss just now the plan for extending the water supply of New York laid before Mayor McCLELLAN by Commissioner OAKLEY. It is probably not intended to be seriously considered. Everybody connected with the City Government in a responsible executive or legislative capacity is so busy with politics that even the best of plans would have no chance of favorable consideration.

1904-10-28T00:00:00Z,"Business upon the Stock Exchange was dominated yesterday by a single factor. On Wednesday the Exchange had manufactured a futile war scare of its own, but yesterday the foreign telegrams and foreign bourses supplied the real article. It is easy to say that no American railway will earn anything less, or be any less valuable, because of a transatlantic war, but this is a superficial view."

Knox of Tammany's Law Committee to have an army of lawyers in court yesterday morning.

1904-10-29T00:00:00Z,"Quite apart from its text, this new book about Paris is of unusual pictorial merit. Mr. Ward's colored plates are rarely disappointing.

1904-10-29T00:00:00Z,"There are two good things about Mr. Baldwin's book. One is his introduction; the other is the rather unusual choice of stories he has made.

1904-10-29T00:00:00Z,"The British press seems unanimous not merely in refusing to accept Admiral ROJESTVENSKY'S account of the firing on British fishermen in the North Sea, but in treating it with ridicule as a fabrication. On the other hand, it is accepted in Russia by the press and the populace as a complete vindication of the conduct of the Russian squadron."
