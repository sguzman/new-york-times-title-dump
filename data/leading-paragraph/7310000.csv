2010-01-05T00:00:00Z,"The evening before he was sworn into office, Barack Obama stepped out of Blair House, the government residence where he was staying across from the White House, and climbed into an armored limousine for the ride to a bipartisan dinner. Joining him in the back seat were John Brennan, his new counterterrorism adviser, and two foreign-policy advisers, Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert. The three men with the president-elect were out of breath, having rushed more than a mile from transition headquarters on foot after failing to find a taxi in Washington's preinaugural madness. As the motorcade moved out, they updated Obama on gathering evidence of a major terrorist plot to attack his inauguration. After a weekend of round-the-clock analysis, the nation's intelligence agencies were concerned that the threat was real, the men told him. A group of Somali extremists was reported to be coming across the border from Canada to detonate explosives as the new president took the oath of office. With more than a million onlookers viewing the ceremony from the National Mall and hundreds of millions more watching on television around the world, what could be a more devastating target? ''All the data points suggested there was a real threat evolving quickly that had an overseas component,'' Juan Carlos Zarate, President George W. Bush's deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism, told me in November. As the inauguration approached, signs of a plot ''seemed to be growing in credibility and relevance.'' Another senior Bush official involved in those tense events a year ago said last fall that protecting the new president was not enough. Even a failed attack would send a debilitating message to the world. ''If something happens on the podium and there's chaos,'' this official told me, ''that's the first time you see the new president, and you really don't want that.''"

2010-01-05T00:00:00Z,"APPLETON--Bernard S.,known his entire life as Bob, passed away peacefully at home on January 1, 2010, exactly two weeks shy of his 85th birthday. Throughout his long and productive life, Bob brought wisdom, compassion, wit and generosity to everything and everyone in his world. In every capacity, in every role, whether it be family or community or business, he fulfilled it far beyond expectation. He served his country with honor, his principles with conviction, and his family with immeasurable love and devotion. His warmth and spirit and knowledge have touched lives on every continent, and will continue to do so for generations to come. He was a student, a teacher, a benefactor and a mentor. As engineer and inventor, he never offered problems, only solutions, and found success at every turn. As a singular member of his community, he spread his personal brand of philanthropy over an area too wide to ascribe. As the hub and heart of his family, he sheltered and nurtured us all. He will be dearly missed and always loved by his wife of 57 years, Helen; his daughter, Elizabeth, and son, Dennis; their spouses, Mark and Leslie; his two grandchildren, Hilary and Seth, the next generation to carry on all he loved and cared for, and the ultimate pride and true joy of his life; and his honorary and extended families in Germany, Italy, Japan, around the world and across this country. Funeral services will be held at 1:00 on Wednesday, January 6, at Boulevard-Riverside Chapels, 1450 Broadway, Hewlett, NY. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate contributions to a charity reflecting his kindness and character. We miss you so much, Bopo Harry Daddy Bob."
2010-01-05T00:00:00Z,"MANASSE--Claus George, 80, passed away on January 3rd, surrounded by his loving family. He was the kindest, gentlest man who inspired devotion in all who knew him.

We will miss you always, and we know how fortunate we were to learn from your illustrious example. Claus was a beloved husband, father, father-in-law, grandfather, brother and uncle. He is survived by his wife Ellen, his children Michael and Karen, his grandchildren Joshua and Hannah, and his sister Renata Manasse Schwebel.

2010-01-05T00:00:00Z,"FABRICIUS--Dr. Walter. Dr. Walter Fabricius, 72, on December 27, 2009, after a brief illness, surrounded by his loving family. Dear father to daughters Daniela Fabricius and Stephanie Weidenbecher, and grandfather to Lucas Weidenbecher; beloved husband of Dagmar, and brother to Bernhard and Guenther. Dr. Fabricius was the President of Fabricius and Company, a financial and investment services firm he established after a long and illustrious career that included serving as Managing Director at Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan, and Auda Advisor Associates. He earned his doctorate in Constitutional Law from the University of Mainz, Germany, following degrees in Law and Economics from the Universities of Heidelberg and Munich, Germany, and studies at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris and the Gordonstoun School in Scotland. After practicing law for several years in Mannheim and Heidelberg, Germany, Dr. Fabricius joined the offices of Deutsche Bank in Germany in 1973. His fluency in German, English, and French, coupled with his gift for cross-cultural diplomacy, were great assets to Deutsche Bank, which sent him to New York in 1976. There he became integral to the growth of Deutsche Bank's presence in the United States. While with Deutsche Bank in New York, he served as Executive Vice-President and Head of the Corporate Finance Group of Deutsche Bank Capital Corporation, before becoming Managing Director and Head of the Asset Management Products Group of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. In 1996, after more than twenty years with Deutsche Bank, he joined J.P. Morgan as Managing Director of the International Private Client Group. In 1999, he became Managing Director of Auda Advisor Associates, helping to expand the firm from a small company managing the wealth of the Harald Quandt family to a major provider of alternative investment products. He devoted himself full time to Fabricius & Company in 2007, and relished its location at the iconic Rockefeller Center. Born March 17, 1937 in Berlin, Germany, Dr. Fabricius was an heir of Carl Johann Freudenberg, who in 1849 founded Freudenberg & Co., which remains one of the largest and oldest family-owned companies in Germany. Dr. Fabricius grew up in the Freudenberg family home in Weinheim, Germany, and served on the company advisory board for two decades. He was heir also to a storied history of German arts and culture; his parents were from Munich's Herzogpark district, where his grandfather Walter Courvoisier, a Swiss composer, was a friend and neighbor of novelist Thomas Mann. Walter Courvoisier's father-in-law and mentor was Ludwig Thuille, himself a renowned composer and intimate friend of Richard Strauss. Having spent his earliest childhood in wartime Germany, Dr. Fabricius was of a generation that wished to rebuild the reputation of their country and promote strong international relationships. He often spoke of this and lived by example, working in both official and personal ways to strengthen ties between his birth nation and his country of residence. Dr. Fabricius is remembered as a natural diplomat, a trusted advisor, and a generous friend; a frequent trans-Atlantic traveler, his suitcase was always heavy with gifts for lifelong clients and loved ones. He was known for his elegance of manner and style, and brought to his work and life old-world discretion and charm. He possessed a boundless, youthful energy, and was an innovator in developing modern financial tools such as the industrial revenue bond. He was a consummate networker with a wide and impressive array of clients whom he treated with familial warmth, who in turn trusted his prudence, experience, and intelligence. To his daughters he was a source of unconditional love and support, of patience and wisdom, a model of integrity, a teacher and storyteller, a proud father who openly adored his girls. To his wife he was simply everything a prince, a partner, and the love of her life. Dr. Fabricius was a mentor to many, and touched many lives with his boundless willingness to lend an ear or offer help. He treated all who crossed his path with equal dignity and respect. Dr. Fabricius had an extraordinary ear for music and language, and loved to play the piano for his daughters or show off his talent for making puns and imitating dialects. He was a passionate and knowledgeable listener of jazz and classical music, and an experienced connoisseur of wine and cuisine. He also took great pleasure in making and editing home movies using the latest available technologies. Weekends were spent tending the garden at the family's house in East Hampton, where he also played handyman. Dr. Fabricius was beloved, trusted, and admired by a wide circle of family, friends, and colleagues, among whom he famously never forgot a birthday. He left us too suddenly and all too soon, but leaves behind a legacy to aspire to."

Originally when I booked my Central America trip I thought I would travel through Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and my plan in Costa Rica was to write something narrowly about its success in health care. But then I chose to spend a bit more time in Honduras and Nicaragua, and everybody seemed to be out of Costa Rica for holiday travel. Since my return flight was from Costa Rica, I went anyway but figured I probably wouldn't be able to write. (And, frankly, my daughter had come along for the trip in part because of the promise of going to Costa Rica; I didn't want to be the one to tell her that she would get the Honduran slums and impoverished Nicaraguan villages, but no Costa Rican beach or jungle....)Then a Times researcher, Hilary Howard, sent me the Happy Planet Index report, which I read while driving around the country. The report got me thinking about Costa Rica and happiness. So I poked around, perused the data, and the column took shape. Originally, I thought I would frame the column more in terms of Latin and Caribbean countries doing unusually well in happiness surveys; I was fascinated by the idea that this reflected a cultural emphasis on building social capital as opposed to financial capital. But although it's an interesting theory, I never found much evidence for it, and so I focused on Costa Rica and the gains it made in education after abolishing its army."

Her approach to Sondheim &#8220;is a dramatic no-holds-barred wrestling match between the singer and the song, in which there is little doubt about the outcome,&#8221; <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/arts/music/01look-music.html?8ur&emc=ur"">writes Stephen Holden</a>. &#8220;Because Ms. Stritch is a ferociously age-defiant theatrical force, &#8220;Singin&#8217;&#160;&#8221; doesn&#8217;t fully evoke the savage, canny dramatic eviscerations one can expect in a show that may well be legendary after its run concludes on Jan. 30.&#8221; "

Dos Toros is something of an homage.&#8221; There are only three items on the menu: a taco, burrito and quesadilla, with a variety of possible preparations. Hint: say yes to the guacamole. Go for the &#8220;simple and succulent food, stripped-down cooking served in Spartan conditions. Just like at Gordo, Dos Toros has a short menu, high standards and such satisfying fare you don&#8217;t mind the hospital lighting.&#8221; Also look out for other Left Coast details: &#8220;the biodegradable corn-based utensils, the aggressive composting policy, the disarmingly nice staff.&#8221; It will make you feel like you&#8217;re in sunny California, at least until you walk back outside.

Eric Liebetrau, the journal’s managing editor, said in an e-mail message that Nielsen and Kirkus were “in the process of working out an arrangement with an acquiring company to continue the publication of the magazine.” He said he had no further details about the identity of the acquiring company, but said news was expected by the end of the month. “We will definitely publish a second issue in January,” Mr. Liebetrau wrote, “and then reassess the situation and hopefully continue publication in February and beyond.” Kirkus, a biweekly founded in 1933, published nearly 5,000 reviews a year."
2010-01-06T00:00:00Z,"As “Avatar” knocks down box office records, the film has hit another, less estimable milestone: it has become the fastest-pirated movie, according to one tracking firm’s figures. The Times of London reported that “Avatar,” starring Zoë Saldana, right, was illegally downloaded 500,000 times in the first two days of its release and 980,000 times in the first week, citing figures from the Web site TorrentFreak.com, which tracks usage of the file-sharing tool BitTorrent. In the days leading up to the film’s release last month, its director, James Cameron, seemed confident that the 3-D effects would essentially make it immune to piracy, telling The Times of London, “You can pirate a 3-D movie, but you can’t pirate it in 3-D, so you can’t bottle that 3-D experience.” But the TorrentFreak.com numbers seem to tell a different story: “Avatar” was illegally downloaded far more often than its closest competitor, the “Twilight” sequel “New Moon,” which was downloaded 610,000 times in its first week of release. Still, 20th Century Fox, which released “Avatar,” seemed unconcerned that piracy would hurt box office grosses, which last weekend surpassed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales. “Bootleg copies are unlikely to have much impact,” a studio spokesman told The Times of London. “Seeing the movie in 3-D in a cinema offers an experience that cannot be replicated.”."

If he does not, heaven will collapse and Satan will reign supreme. Marion McClinton is directing the production; he is best known for his direction of plays by August Wilson, including the Broadway production of “King Hedley II,” for which he was nominated for a Tony Award.

2010-01-06T00:00:00Z,"There is something cinematic about riding a bicycle through New York traffic with its speed, lights and danger. For the rider, street scenes can open up in flashes between stopped cars, creating a kind of stuttered approximation of film. No wonder, then, that many riders, like Luke Stiles and Chris Thormann, have tried to capture these scenes with a camera. From the backs of scooters and the tops of skateboards, Mr. Stiles, 36, a software developer and former racer, and Mr. Thormann, 25, a bicycle messenger and alleycat rider, have been shooting ''Empire,'' a film about everything that is ''fun, scary and exciting'' about bicycling in the city without brakes. ''It's in the sub-sub-subgenre that is fixed-gear action sports videos,'' Mr. Stiles explained. A profile in the latest issue of Cog magazine chronicles the project, which Mr. Stiles and Mr. Thormann hope to complete by this spring."

The producers had an opportunity to move into the Neil Simon Theater this spring for a limited run, but decided they needed more time to prepare the transfer, said the executives, James Houghton and Michael Wilson, who are the respective artistic directors of the Signature Theater Company and Hartford Stage. The play, a co-production now running at Signature through March, was the last work by Foote before he died last year, and is based on the lives of his parents and relatives in Texas in the early 1900s; the intention is to transfer the full cast, including Bill Heck and Maggie Lacey, above. Daryl Roth, a lead member of the consortium planning the Broadway transfer, said that the producers wanted more time to lock in group ticket sales, scale the production from the 160-seat Signature space to a larger theater, and develop a marketing plan for “Orphans,” which is a three-part play that runs nine hours and lacks star actors."

Nanjing!” (also known as “City of Life and Death”), about the Japanese occupation of Nanjing in 1937, and “Quick Quick Slow Slow,” a short film, were withdrawn, according to China’s state-run Beijing Times, because the festival plans to screen a movie called “The Sun Behind the Clouds: Tibet’s Struggle for Freedom.” That film, a documentary by Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam, follows the Dalai Lama for a year, and its description in the festival’s program said that it chronicled “the 2008 protests in Tibet, the long march in India, the Beijing Olympics and the breakdown of talks with China.” The Beijing Times called the movie a “Tibetan independence” film. A representative for “Nanjing! Nanjing!” said that the films were pulled on the order of China’s ministry of foreign affairs, its film bureau and the consulate general of China in Los Angeles."

But the principal flutist of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra had some less than complimentary things to say about the Los Angeles Philharmonic, according to a newspaper report. The flutist, Mathieu Dufour, had been on leave and was performing with the Philharmonic temporarily — a fairly common occurrence when first-chair players are considering a move. Mr. Dufour has decided to stay at his Midwestern job, The Chicago Sun-Times reported on Tuesday, quoting him as saying that the Los Angeles Philharmonic has “no tradition there — no tradition of sound and no tradition of working together as a dedicated ensemble.” He added, “Maybe they will have that someday in the future.” Los Angeles has fine musicians, he said. “But we have achieved a very strong common purpose and set of aims in Chicago that they do not have or do not yet have there.” Deborah F. Rutter, the Chicago orchestra’s president, called Mr. Dufour’s decision “great news.” A spokesman for the Philharmonic, Sophie Jefferies, said: “We’re very sorry to see him go and wish him all the best. He is an amazing player.”."

2010-01-07T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (TCM) TCM MEMORIAL TRIBUTE: JENNIFER JONES Turner Classic Movies devotes the evening to the work of Ms. Jones, who died on Dec. 17. Born Phyllis Isley in Tulsa, Okla., she became a Northwestern University sorority girl and married Robert Walker in 1939. The couple tried to find success as actors. Ms. Jones modeled and, in a final effort to achieve her dream, auditioned for David O. Selznick. A star was born when she won an Oscar for ''The Song of Bernadette'' (1943), her first role as the newly minted Jennifer Jones. So was a love affair -- with Selznick. This salute begins with ''Duel in the Sun'' (1946), starring Ms. Jones, above with Gregory Peck, in an Oscar-nominated role as Pearl Chavez, who comes between a rancher's good and evil sons. In ''Beat the Devil'' (1954), at 10:30, she joins Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida in John Huston's spoof about a group of cons on their way to Africa to lay claim to uranium deposits in Kenya. In ''Madame Bovary'' (1949), at 12:15 a.m., she plays Flaubert's romantic country girl who sacrifices her marriage, and destroys lives, in her quest for true love. The evening ends at 2:15 with ''Indiscretion of an American Wife'' (1954), starring Montgomery Clift and Ms. Jones as a Philadelphia housewife who can't disentangle herself from her Italian lover. 9 A.M.

2010-01-07T00:00:00Z,"SHAPIRO--Moses David, on December 7, 2009, in Leonia, New Jersey. Born January 3, 1919, David revealed early promise as a pianist, and as a student of Isabella Vengerova he won competitions and entered Columbia College in 1935 as a keyboard and musicology student. In 1941 he was drafted into the army from graduate school, where he had been studying conducting with Carl Bamberger, and left the service with the rank of captain. Returning to civilian life, he became assistant conductor with Thomas Scherman's Little Orchestra Society, and married Madelyn Vose, an opera singer, with whom he toured the United States in a production of Menotti's The Old Maid and the Thief. He co-founded the New York Percussion Trio, which released an album, Holidays for Percussion, in 1958. In the following three decades the Trio gave over three thousand performances in schools, theaters and on television, promoting percussion music and commissioning new works by emerging composers. In 1961, he received a Fulbright cultural exchange grant, which was twice renewed, to teach western music in Korea and to conduct the Korean Broadcasting System Symphony Orchestra. In 1964 he conducted the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra and wrote an award-winning series of radio broadcasts on the history of western music. After several years as a musical director with the San Francisco Opera, he returned to the Far East where he conducted several operas, including the premier of James Wade's The Martyred, in Korea. In 1973 he turned to the keyboard, and over the next thirty years, he participated in hundreds of performances with several chamber music groups, mastering a significant repertory of ensemble music. During this period he was also a voice coach and recital accompanist, a piano teacher, an instructor at the Mannes School of Music, and a member of many civic and cultural organizations, including the Bergen County Museum of Art and Science where he gave numerous performances. A person of wide intellectual interests and a deep devotion to the arts, he encouraged the efforts of performers and composers, in many domains and of diverse talents, to participate in the creative enterprise. These qualities, along with an exceptional degree of personal integrity and a gentle nature, earned the respect of his fellow artists and his family's admiration. He is survived by his brother Samuel, his sons Peter and Joseph, a granddaughter Lani Anna, his nephews Jon and Raphael, his nieces Susan and Anne, his cousin Michael, Amy Lee, and many other family members and friends who mourn his passing. A daughter, Caralyn Anne, predeceased him."

She never appeared as a weekend guest without smoked salmon and a box of schnecken under her arm.

She was a sharp and tactful businesswoman who built the family business, Mr. Christmas, alongside her husband of more than 50 years, Merril. She cared for Merril devotedly until his death in 2000. We will never forget her kindness, giddy humor, stubborn optimism, generosity, and selflessness. Lydia is survived by her daughter and son-in-law, Linda and Robert Eder, her son Terry Hermanson, her daughter-in-law Susie Hermanson, her five granddaughters, Elizabeth Thede, Randy Steinman, Sarah Meister, Leslie Hermanson and Merril Hermanson, and her six great-grandchildren, Victoria Thede, Kate, Jill and Ally Steinman and Madeline and Lee Meister.

Nine years later, I interviewed for a job as the Mariners beat writer at The Seattle Post-Intelligencer. The Mariners' clubhouse, at the time, seemed toxic. A promising team was crumbling quickly.

2010-01-07T00:00:00Z,"ADAMS--William Healey, 63 years young, passed away on January 3, 2010, after a two and half year battle with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). In an email to his daughter on New Year's Day, he said he would ""keep fighting."" Surrounding his bedside were his wife of 38 years, Ellen (Dale), his two children, Brooke and Beau. Bill Adams was born in Charlotte, North Carolina on November 16, 1946, the son of Mary Frances (Healey) and Thaddeus Adams. He was predeceased by his parents and his two brothers, Thaddeus and Douglas. Bill Adams grew up in Charlotte, was a star athlete in high school and was recruited to play basketball at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill) by the legendary coach, Dean Smith. Upon achieving distinction as a freshman, Bill was excused from basketball by Dean Smith when the coach discovered that Bill had lost a kidney playing football in high school. Coach Smith remained a mentor and close friend throughout Bill's life. After graduating from UNC in 1969, Bill moved to New York where he joined the Bank of New York. In 1976 Bill Adams and Ellen moved to San Francisco, where he helped to open the corporate branch of the Chemical Bank. The Adams family, now including Brooke and Beau, moved back to New York in 1981. However, their experience of living in San Francisco was to draw them back in 1984. Prior to his current position as a managing director of Chilton Investment Company, he was the CFO of the Bank of San Francisco and managing director at Bankers Trust for its Pacific Rim private banking. Bill's athleticism was aptly demonstrated on the golf course. He loved the competition and the camaraderie inherent in golf. He was a member of the San Francisco Golf Club, the Cypress Point Club, the Burlingame Country Club and the US Seniors Golf Association. In addition, he enjoyed his friendships at the Pacific Union Club and in New York at the Brook and the Racquet & Tennis Club (where he was an accomplished squash player). While at UNC, Bill Adams was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and the Lodge. Despite being afflicted with ALS, Bill Adams established and was central to the William H. Adams Foundation for ALS Research, which actively supports ongoing research in the effort to find a cure for ALS. Since its formation in 2008, the Foundation has contributed over $1 million to fund cutting edge research under the sponsorship of Dr. Jeffrey Rothstein at the Packard Center at Johns Hopkins. One of Bill's most cherished moments was the August 31st, 2009 ALS fundraiser organized by the Adams Foundation and hosted by golf legend, Tom Watson. Bill Adams was devoted to his family, and their time together, both at home and traveling, was most important to him. He is survived by his wife Ellen, his two children, his daughter's husband, Zach Read, and two grandchildren, Isabelle and William (""Briggs"") Read. There will be a memorial service at 3pm on Thursday, the 14th of January at St. Ignatius Church in San Francisco. In lieu of flowers, donations in Bill's memory can be made to the William H. Adams Foundation for ALS Research, Deutsche Bank Alex Brown, 101 California Street, 46th Floor, San Francisco, California 94111, attention: Lisa Walsh."

The films, “City of Life and Death” (also called “Nanjing! Nanjing!”) and “Quick, Quick, Slow,” were withdrawn from the festival by China’s foreign affairs ministry and its film bureau in protest of another film, “The Sun Behind the Clouds: Tibet’s Struggle for Freedom.” That film, a documentary, chronicles a year in the life of the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. In a statement Darryl Macdonald, the director of the festival, said the films were withdrawn when the festival did not comply with a request from the Chinese to cancel screenings of “The Sun Behind the Clouds.” He added: “We cannot allow the concerns of one country or community to dictate what films we should or should not play, based on their own cultural or political perspective.” The festival said “City of Life and Death,” with Liu Ye, above, in a scene from the film, would be replaced with screenings of “For a Moment, Freedom,” an Austrian and French film about Middle Eastern refugees seeking European visas; and “Sticky Fingers,” a Canadian, French and Spanish comedy about inept gangsters.

The players’ contract expired at the end of August, but they have agreed to continue rehearsing and performing. Management, citing salary cuts among staff members and the music director, Franz Welser-Möst, above, offered a three-year contract calling for a 5 percent cut in the first year, a restoration of that amount in the second and a 2.5 percent increase in the third. “We need the union to recognize the shared sacrifice throughout the institution and respond in kind,” Gary Hanson, the orchestra’s executive director, said in a statement. The players offered a salary freeze for this year. A spokesman for the players, Howard C. Landau, said they had made concessions in the past, “which is why we keep slipping in the rankings” in relation to salaries at other orchestras. “We just can’t keep slipping any further,” he added. “There’s no way we can stay competitive.

Tributes to even the best shows can smother them in pomposity. ''The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special: In 3-D! On Ice!'' is worth a look because -- as the self-mocking title suggests -- it doesn't make too big a deal of one of the most innovative, influential and irresistibly irreverent shows in the history of television. The event opens with a new episode, ''Once Upon a Time in Springfield,'' followed by an hourlong documentary by Morgan Spurlock, the director and star of ''Super Size Me.'' The writers make a few smirking references to the show's longevity -- Bart at the blackboard writes over and over, ''The world may end in 2012, but this show won't.''

But now that a 2006 state law restricting water use for landscaping is finally taking effect, local jurisdictions all over the state must figure out what to do about the issue by Jan. 31. Some are adopting the state's model ordinance on landscaping and water conservation; others, like Palo Alto and Menlo Park, are trying to come up with their own. Some of these severely limit the extend of lawns in new or remodeled corporate or residential landscapes. Wary of these possibilities and other more draconian drought-driven restrictions, homeowners in high-end lawn-bedecked suburbs like Atherton and Hillsborough are putting in their own wells as insurance against municipal water cutbacks.Taking It Slow and Easy in Sonoma | An Italian group recently honored Sonoma as a ""slow city,"" providing the livability of a time gone by, with few if any chain stores, enough farmers' markets and a pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly ambiance. But the corollary of being slow seems to be being white and old and rich, judging by the town's demographics. Which raises some questions: What price is the town paying for its slow lifestyle? Does it mean that many people who work in Sonoma have to drive a long way to get there? Will it mean that the generation growing up in Sonoma will be unlikely to have the money to live there?"

Even a Stylite Monk sitting on top of a column for 30 years might serve as a source in a story about his motivations or experiences. The policy appears to me to be facially nonsense. A better idea? Have all writers disclose to The Times all investments over $500 and all receipts of value greater than $250, have the list available to me online and let me judge the extent, if any, that their coverage might be influenced. MARK TRENTACOSTECherry Hill, N.J., Jan. 3, 2010 ●It is surprising that The Times would rely solely upon 3M's reimbursement of travel expenses for Mary Tripsas to condemn her for violating policy, when 3M might have contributed instead to her Harvard Business School research budget (or had its proxy do so) and thus avoided the perception of a conflict. My experience has shown me that it is impossible to avoid all potential conflicts and that some conflicts may actually be productive. I agree that The Times should take a firm stand on the most egregious conflicts, but rather than focus obsessively on avoiding all conflicts, it should also consider the quality of the work produced.I think that it would have been more valuable if you had provided some commentary on the column that Ms. Tripsas wrote on 3M to assess whether and how her writing might have been influenced by the arrangement. That places a higher burden on the public advocate, but one that is appropriate, in my view.STEVE PERCOCOEast Falmouth, Mass., Jan. 3, 2010 ●The policy described in your column, that your that contributors ""must be free of even the smallest hint of undue influence,"" goes beyond what I feel is necessary to ensure that the ""readers have reason to trust our credibility."" Frankly, I am offended that The the Times's editors would feel I am such a puritan and/or ignoramus as to assume that any junket given to a freelance reporter in an entirely separate matter would taint the reporter's credibility and objectivity, or that of The Times. I certainly don't discount the risk of such things happening. Rather, I think that The Times is taking the easy way out. I would respect The Times more if it would allow a limited amount of flexibility in such cases, and itself undertook to determine whether a freelancer's other activities threatened the credibility of what appeared in The Times. I recognize that part of the problem in the cases you cite is the fact that the freelancers didn't report their own conflicts, and that is a separate issue from the conflicts themselves. Nevertheless, I remain uneasy that you are unable to live with the mere existence of conflicts. It reminds me of the concept of ""ritual uncleanliness"" that notionally pollutes all who come in contact with it, which is unworthy of an intelligent and sophisticated society.I have no intention of canceling my subscription, nor of ceasing my regular visits to The Times's Web site, just because you have gone so far in depriving yourselves, and your readers, of useful contributors as to arguably lower the potential range of your coverage. But a regular and loyal customer nevertheless considers that you have done just that, and would be happy if you eased off just a little. DON THOMASCalgary, Alberta, Jan. 3, 2010 ●Rather than outright disqualification, wouldn't simple disclosure of the potential conflict - in or alongside the published column - do the job in many cases? That way the reader could decide what weight to give the potential conflict in evaluating the reliability of the information in the column and the worth of the columnist's opinion. JIM LUTHERMendocino, Calif., Jan. 4, 2010 ●When someone is on the staff of The Times, The Times undoubtedly pays for their travel to important conferences in the field they cover. But if they freelance they must pay for these trips with their own money?Sounds to me like it's unethical for The Times to hire freelancers, because it's a cheapskate way of transferring legitimate business expenses from The Times to the worker. The Times should cover these expenses themselves if the paper feels it is a conflict of interest for someone else to cover them (which I agree, it is). Forcing freelancers to pay those expenses when employees get them covered is not fair.ISABEL WALCOTT DRAVESManhattan, Jan 4, 2010●●Scientists and JournalistsRe ""Stolen E-Mail, Stoking the Climate Debate"" (Dec. 5): With some real intensive investigative research, maybe this is a ""three-alarm story."" One way or another, The Times needs to get this one right. If this is a fraud, The Times surely does not want to be the last to acknowledge it. We cannot afford to be wrong on climate warming. If the Associated Press can put 11 staff members on Sarah Palin's new book, The Times must have the staff to follow through on climate warming -- including giving the many highly respectable skeptics a sufficient platform for raising their issues, and sinking or swimming. MIKE BOURISMendocino, Calif., Dec. 6, 2009 ●Why is it that the media at large, and your column in particular, refers to supporters of the human-caused global warming theory as ""scientists,"" but uses the term ""skeptics"" (not scientists) for any scientist who rebuts that theory? Are not the physicist Fred Singer and the climatologist Timothy Ball scientists (as well as skeptics)?Should you not describe the two camps as ""supporters and skeptics,"" or simply scientists? By referring to one group as ""scientists"" and the other as ""skeptics,"" you are boosting the credentials of one at the expense of the other. RONALD BREMNER Glen Ridge, N.J., Dec. 6, 2009 ●You missed a major opportunity to explore the difference in reporting on politics and science - and the challenges faced by reporters when science becomes politicized. I'm sure you know that there is broad scientific consensus on the science behind climate change. The latest I.P.C.C. synthesis report is quite clear about the cause and threat. At what point is it O.K. for a credible news organization to stop publicizing discredited theories and individuals? Does there need to be any verifiable proof at all? Or is it O.K. to give a few contrarians equal billing? At what point (if at all) did The Times stop quoting tobacco-industry-funded spokespeople? If we could find a few ""scientists"" to insist the sun revolves around the earth would we create a man-bites-dog controversy - and give them equal billing? SAM BOYKINQueens, Dec. 7, 2009 ● A deliberate conspiracy to cover up information is hardly ever the problem with The New York Times or any other media outlet. The problem is bias, which is not deliberate, but often unconscious. I have little doubt that The Times will be as conscientious and professional as possible, but because your information is necessarily limited and uncertain, you will tend to favor the data and the interpretations that support your belief in anthropogenic global warming. That's normal and natural. Bias is a powerful force operating on any journalist. This much has become clear as a result of Climategate: The myth, perpetrated by global warming alarmists, that we have serene, Olympian scientists on the one hand and ideologically driven skeptics on the other is now gone with the global wind. If we are honest and admit the inevitable presence of bias even in the aeries of science, then we must acknowledge that the skeptics have a vital role to play in the debate, especially since it is now clear that we cannot count on the global-warming advocates to check themselves. If nothing else, the skeptics can improve the science of global warming by finding problems for advocates in the science to solve. TUCKER LANDYFrankfort, Ky., Dec. 6, 2009"

2010-01-09T00:00:00Z,"KURLAND--Shelly, 81, died Wednesday in Nashville, TN. Shelly was a Juilliard trained violinist with a masters degree in music, a career he first pursued at Cornell University. He arrived in Nashville in 1964 to teach at Peabody College, and before long was doing session and television work with Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, George Jones, Bob Dylan, Neil Young and scores of others. A gifted musician and also a visionary, with the Nashville music scene changing in the 60's, he organized local string players into a collective to perform live and on recordings. His group, the Shelly Kurland Strings won numerous ""Super Picker Awards"", given each year to musicians who played on the most number one records. Shelly was born and raised in Brooklyn by his parents, Samuel and Beatrice, and for a short time by his Uncle Julius. He always said his childhood was spent going to violin lessons, where he dreamed of playing stickball. After retirement, Shelly traveled with his wife Barbara and doted on his children Amy, Wendy and Peter; their spouses Kelly Collom, Mark Zimbicki and Shannon Wood; and his grandchildren Peter, Zoey, Julian, Ben and Stephanie. He was a generous investor in his children's endeavors including The Bluebird Cafe, Darkhorse Theater and Homework Hotline. He added to the lives of Maureen Franklin, Hilarie Moore and Elina Sorakunnas. His sister Elaine (Murray) Koren of New York City survives him. He moved his family to London and Europe in 1968, took the entire clan to the beach every summer, and made more trips to Disney World than he cared to remember. It can be truly said that the Kurlands never run out of occasions for family dinners and Shelly never passed up the opportunity to pick up the check. Shelly was known for his sense of humor. He began his book An Adult Guide to the Orchestra: ""The most important thing in a string player's life is where he sits. First chair outside is the star. Last chair inside is pathetic."" Wherever he is, Shelly is first chair today. Persons wishing to commemorate Shelly's life are encouraged to contribute to Homework Hotline, 4805 Park Avenue, Nashville 37209."

2010-01-09T00:00:00Z,"COHEN--Melvin S.,Chairman Emeritus of Molina Fine Jewelers and Black, Starr & Frost. Melvin ""Mel"" Stephen Cohen passed away on January 1, 2010. He was born in New York City on July 11, 1919. He is survived by his beloved wife of 66 years Frances M. Cohen; loving daughters, Sallie (Michael) Goldwyn of Portland, OR and Gwendolyn Coleman of Los Angeles, CA, and five grandchildren Eli, Joshua, and Adam Goldwyn and Elizabeth and Warren Siroka. Mel received his undergraduate degree from New York University and a Master's Degree from Harvard School of Business. He served as an officer in the United States Army for four years. Cohen comes from a long line of distinguished jewelers. He joined his family's business, A. Cohen & Sons Corporation, in 1946 and he took it public in 1969, as the largest wholesale jewelry company in the country. This business was instrumental in saving the jewelry industry during the depression by creating a program that allowed jewelers who could not meet their financial obligations, to continue to purchase goods. Mel was a leader in the jewelry industry. He served as the president of the 24 Karat Club of New York in 1975 and as the Chairman from 1983 1985. He was the oldest living member of this prestigious organization. Cohen also served as the president of the American Jewelry Distributors Association, ORT Jewelry Industry and the Wholesale Jewelers Association. Cohen has been honored by many for his distinguished service to others: Honorary Kentucky Colonel, 1964 Man of the Year, Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, 1969 Human Relations Award, American Jewish Committee, 1970, Guardian of the State of Israel, State of Israel Bonds, 1972, Brotherhood Award, National Conference of Christians and Jews, 1974, Distinguished Community Service Award, Brandeis University 1977, Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith, Torch of Liberty Award, 1980. When Cohen was no longer involved in active corporate life, he served as a consultant to Fortunoff in New York and was vice chairman of District 65 UAW Health and Pension Plans. Mel was an avid golfer. He was a charter member of the International Golfing Society; he served as Treasurer, Glen Oaks Country Club in Old Westbury, NY and President, of the Biltmore Country Club in Phoenix, AZ. He shot a Hole-in-One at Glen Oaks on August 26, 1987 and he shot his age at least once every year between his 75th and 80th birthday. Mel and his wife Fran moved from Great Neck, NY, to Phoenix, AZ in 1982. There he served as the Chairman Emeritus for Molina Fine Jewelers from 1992 and Black, Starr & Frost from 2006, until his passing. Mel was loved and respected by many and he will be remembered for his passion, wisdom and story telling. His family would like to thank those that touched Mel's life at the Veterans Administration and the dialysis center at Scottsdale Healthcare. Memorial contributions may be made to ORT America (Organization for Rehabilitation through Training), 75 Maiden Lane, 10th floor, New York, New York 10038, or Scottsdale Healthcare Foundation Cancer Center, 1001 N. 92nd St., Suite 121, Scottsdale, AZ 85258."

He said the producers should have taken down posters in the theater district that suggest the show is opening soon; the musical's Web site still says that previews start Feb. 25. The lead producer, Michael Cohl, who took over in November, has said that the production would take place on Broadway sometime this year.

A few years later, he became the owner of an established Minneapolis advertising agency, which became known as Manson-Gold-Miller, Inc. Moving to New York in 1957, Miller became Chairman and CEO of American Paper. He retired in 1990 and wrote a novel, entitled, Zig/Zag. At an early age, Miller became actively involved in Jewish community affairs, particularly in fundraising for the Minneapolis Jewish Federation. In 1968, he was named Israel Bonds ""Man of the Year."" In 1970 Miller became president of Temple Emanu-El in Great Neck, Long Island, and was elected a life member of the Board of Directors of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.

2010-01-10T00:00:00Z,"IN 1951, Jack Kerouac sat down at his typewriter and feverishly banged out -- on a 120-foot-long scroll, single-spaced and devoid of paragraphs -- all he could recall of his extensive road trips across America and Mexico. Raw and open, ''On the Road'' captured the restless energy of Kerouac's generation, and inspired a wealth of artists, writers and musicians to come. All it lacked, apparently, was pictures. For the last couple of years, Ed Ruscha (who, in the '60s, created a series of photographic books inspired by the romantic spirit of the Beats) has been working on that -- taking photographs, commissioning them from other artists, digging through piles of found images to create his own version of the epic novel. The result is a 228-page leather-bound artist's book that pairs Kerouac's words with Ruscha's visuals. All that's missing now is the $10,000 to buy it."

Looks that way. How old is too old to wear an outfit covered in a naked-lady print? That's a tough one.

He was born in New York City on July 11, 1919. He is survived by his beloved wife of 66 years Frances M. Cohen; loving daughters, Sallie (Michael) Goldwyn of Portland, OR and Gwendolyn Coleman of Los Angeles, CA, and five grandchildren Eli, Joshua, and Adam Goldwyn and Elizabeth and Warren Siroka. Mel received his undergraduate degree from New York University and a Master's Degree from Harvard School of Business. He served as an officer in the United States Army for four years. Cohen comes from a long line of distinguished jewelers. He joined his family's business, A. Cohen & Sons Corporation, in 1946 and he took it public in 1969, as the largest wholesale jewelry company in the country. This business was instrumental in saving the jewelry industry during the depression by creating a program that allowed jewelers who could not meet their financial obligations, to continue to purchase goods. Mel was a leader in the jewelry industry. He served as the president of the 24 Karat Club of New York in 1975 and as the Chairman from 1983 1985. He was the oldest living member of this prestigious organization. Cohen also served as the president of the American Jewelry Distributors Association, ORT Jewelry Industry and the Wholesale Jewelers Association. Cohen has been honored by many for his distinguished service to others: Honorary Kentucky Colonel, 1964 Man of the Year, Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, 1969 Human Relations Award, American Jewish Committee, 1970, Guardian of the State of Israel, State of Israel Bonds, 1972, Brotherhood Award, National Conference of Christians and Jews, 1974, Distinguished Community Service Award, Brandeis University 1977, Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith, Torch of Liberty Award, 1980. When Cohen was no longer involved in active corporate life, he served as a consultant to Fortunoff in New York and was vice chairman of District 65 UAW Health and Pension Plans. Mel was an avid golfer. He was a charter member of the International Golfing Society; he served as Treasurer, Glen Oaks Country Club in Old Westbury, NY and President, of the Biltmore Country Club in Phoenix, AZ. He shot a Hole-in-One at Glen Oaks on August 26, 1987 and he shot his age at least once every year between his 75th and 80th birthday. Mel and his wife Fran moved from Great Neck, NY, to Phoenix, AZ in 1982. There he served as the Chairman Emeritus for Molina Fine Jewelers from 1992 and Black, Starr & Frost from 2006, until his passing. Mel was loved and respected by many and he will be remembered for his passion, wisdom and story telling. His family would like to thank those that touched Mel's life at the Veterans Administration and the dialysis center at Scottsdale Healthcare.

2010-01-10T00:00:00Z,"An article on Nov. 22 about the Dutch province of Friesland included a number of errors. In reference to Friesland's history, it was the feudal lords -- not the Romans -- who had no success conquering the Frisians in the 13th and 14th centuries. The Frisians were mostly Germanic people, not just Saxons, who had migrated there in the fourth and fifth centuries -- not the first century. Friesland was considered an autonomous and proud region up to the 1500s -- not ''through'' the Middle Ages. And it fell to the Habsburg Empire -- not to the Holy Roman Empire -- at the beginning of the 16th century. Also, while Friesland's agrarian landscape is indeed dotted with terps, mounds measuring from a few to 20 feet high, terps are also found in the North Sea marshlands, encompassing parts of Holland, Germany and Denmark; the mounds are not found just in current-day Friesland. Of the towns whose squares and alleys the writer explored, it was Stavoren -- not Hindeloopen -- that had a more prosperous seaport than Amsterdam up until the 1400s, not the 1700s. And the neighboring towns Stavoren and Hindeloopen, in addition to having a thriving trade with Scandinavia, also had a robust trade with the Baltic countries -- but not with Russia. A reader pointed out the errors in an e-mail message on Nov. 29; this correction was delayed for research."

P. and Isabel Howell Gould, he was born in New York City on September 10, 1919. He graduated from Hotchkiss School in 1939 and Yale University in 1943 where he was a member of DKE and Elihu. From 1941-45, he first served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy and skipper of a subchaser, then executive officer of a destroyer escort in the Pacific. On June 21, 1947 he married Mary (""Sis"") Krech Jackson Gould. Consummate lifelong educator, from 1945-58 Lytt first taught general science, American history and geography, also coaching football and baseball at Landon School Bethesda, MD, and then culminated as Head of the Middle School. During this time in l955 he was also a founding member of the St. Francis Episcopal Church in Potomac, MD. In 1958, Lytt became the headmaster of Far Hills Country Day School, Far Hills, NJ, resigning in 1963 to become a founder and the first headmaster (1963-73) of Purnell School in Pottersville, NJ. Lytt's vision for Purnell was focused on preparing girls in grades 10 to 12 for a full-filling and rewarding life through building self-confidence in an educational environment and curriculum that allowed for the discovery and development of each individual girl's unique talents and character. For Lytt, Sis and several key friends associates and advisors the course to a successful life lead through a range of possibilities including but not limited to a college education. Many of the over 1200 alumnae who graduated from Purnell keep in touch with the Gould's, visited them and recall them both with great affection and gratitude. Valued for demanding and setting high standards for himself and others, and for broad knowledge of education and administration, Lytt served as a member of the board of Miss Porter's School, Holton-Arms School, Garrison Forest School, Briarcliff College, Purnell, and others; a trustee of Mystic Seaport Museum and Lyme Academy of Fine Arts; and on the class council and as alumni fund agent of Yale Class of 1943. Upon ""retiring"" Lytt helped Sis, a pioneer in riding and carriage driving for the disabled through NAHRA, found what became High Hopes Therapeutic Riding Inc. in Old Lyme, CT and hosted equestrian events for the Special Olympics in 1995. He was a member of Essex Yacht Club, Hamburg Cove Yacht Club, Beachton Yacht Club, Old Lyme Country Club, Headmistress Association of the East, and Yale Club (New York). A keen sailor, in the summer Lytt and Sis could be found in Maine on their yawl, Tamaqua, or in residence in Long Cove on Vinalhaven, where they were renowned for their hospitality to many family and friends as well as to visiting yachtsmen--and letting all comers use guest moorings in return for a nominal donation to Purnell School or High Hopes. He and Sis had a large circle of devoted friends, many from Yale or Purnell, to the ends of their lives. Sis predeceased Lytt as did his sister Harriet Gould Rogers. He is survived by his sister Nancy Gould Ripley; son, Lyttleton B.P. Gould III; daughter, Isabel Cynthia Gould; step-daughters, Lylee M. S. Krech and Kara B.

On the other hand, vows are apparently a necessity for an Israeli man who at age 50 has just been granted his 11th divorce. The BBC reports that the man, from Jerusalem, usually divorces after two years and immediately goes out bride hunting. Or perhaps bride reeling. ''I send out a hook in all directions, and the fish come on their own,'' the man, who was not named, said. According to the rabbinical court that announced the divorce, 11 is a record for Jews in Israel. The court praised the man's adherence to religious procedure. Under Jewish law, a man seeking a divorce grants his wife a ''get,'' which declares, ''You are hereby permitted to all men.''"

2010-01-10T00:00:00Z,"HOBBS--John Howard, a pioneer in the investment management industry and a philanthropist avid in his support of education and civil rights, died January 3 at his home in Charlemont, MA at the age of 73. John co-founded Jennison Associates, one of Wall Street's first independent institutional investment management firms, in 1969 with Spiros ""Sig"" Segalas, Jennison's current president and chief investment officer, and five other Wall Street investment professionals. At the time, institutional investment portfolios were managed primarily by large bank investment departments, insurance companies, and investment counselors. John and his colleagues built Jennison with the belief that in-house fundamental research and specialized investment teams would generate superior long-term investment returns. Jennison, now a subsidiary of Prudential Financial, manages more than $90 billion in assets for major institutions, mutual funds, and private individuals. Many of its existing client relationships were established while John was chief executive officer. John was instrumental in Jennison's expansion beyond equities into the institutional fixed income market with the 1975 acquisition of Carter, Doyle & Co. He was named Jennison's president and chief executive officer in 1976 and became chairman in 1994. In 1996, he took on added responsibilities as president of institutional asset management for the global money management group of Prudential. In 2000, he took the helm of Prudential's entire equity asset management business, including the active quantitative management firm Quantitative Management Associates. He served as Jennison's vice chairman from late 2002 until he retired in 2003. ""John was the definition of magnanimous,"" Mr. Segalas said. ""His work ethic was second to none. His humor was infectious, his laughter ever present, and his eyes always had a twinkle. He will be deeply missed by his many friends at Jennison."" Most recently, John was vice chairman and chairman of the audit committee of the Madison Asset Management Group, a global infrastructure investment specialist. Madison is led by former CEOs and senior managing directors of some of Wall Street's most prestigious firms, as well as former cabinet officials, including a U.S. Secretary of Transportation. John was born in Boston. His parents Howard and Anne (Williams) both worked at Simplex Wire & Cable in Cambridge. He lived in Somerville before the family moved to Newton Highlands, where he spent most of his youth. In 1954, he graduated from Newton High School, where he debated and played viola in the school orchestra. With his sisters, Eleanor and Margot, who played violin, he formed the Hobbs Trio, playing in the community. His leadership qualities made him president of the student body and many clubs. John attended Wesleyan University and earned an A.B. from Harvard College in 1960. In 1965, he received an M.B.A. with High Distinction from Harvard Business School. He served in the Air Force Reserve, and spent a year as a Harvard teaching assistant before joining Waddell & Reed, where he became vice president and manager of investment research. John, with his late wife Liz, had a lifelong commitment to making things better for others. He supported education, one of his greatest passions, through numerous educational institutions and philanthropic organizations, especially the Harvard Graduate School of Education. In the 1990s, as co-chairs of the Harvard Graduate School of Education capital campaign steering committee, John and Liz helped raise $111 million dollars, the largest sum ever raised by a school of education. They endowed the John H. and Elisabeth A. Hobbs Chair of Cognition and Education held by Prof. Howard Gardner. They also helped many students cover education costs through the Hobbs Fellowship. John continued his involvement as a member of the dean's advisory board. He also supported Harvard University and the Harvard Business School, serving on the executive committee of the Harvard University committee on university resources and as a member of the board of directors of the associates of the Harvard Business School. He was a trustee of Wesleyan University, a trustee of Milano the New School for Management and Urban Policy, a trustee and president of the board of the Hewitt School in New York, a trustee and chairman of the board of Proctor Academy in Andover, NH, and a trustee of the Academy at Charlemont in Charlemont, MA. His devotion to child education and development extended beyond his support of academia. He was chairman of the board of Common Cents, a non-profit organization that creates and manages service-learning programs for young people. Its best-known program, the Penny Harvest, is the largest child philanthropy program in the U.S. John was also a director and chairman of the board of the Foundation for Child Development and the William T.

Daughter of Eva (Koos) and Lajos Barcza, educated in Budapest and moved to Lausanne, Switzerland in 1943, where she met Francis Bessenyey. They thoroughly disliked each other at first, only to be drawn close upon the German invasion of Hungary. Eva and Francis were married in 1946, and thereafter emigrated to the United States, where they settled in a five story walkup in New York City - ""A damn hot place."" Eva worked for the French bank Societe Generale, and to Francis' dismay, earned more than he did. Eva and Francis had three daughters: Margit, Ilona and Kristina. Eva was the consummate mother, caregiver and peacemaker. She knitted, sewed, cooked, managed three kids' schedules for the next 20 years and, according to Francis' own words, ""kept him in line."" She supported Francis in his professional life, and ensured that he remained an integral part of the family. An avid reader and student of life, Eva knew more than many scholars on a myriad of subjects. Once the children were older, Eva worked for FACSEA, the French Cultural Service, from which she retired in 1990. She received the ""Ordre des Palmes Academique"" for her service to France. Her retirement took her and Francis to Alaska, Florida and Montana for visits with her children and grandchildren. Eva loved opera, Jeopardy, Antiques Roadshow and New York Times Crossword puzzles, which she completed in ink. An expert translator, and despite a health condition that ultimately left her blind, Eva put into English many important books related to Hungarian politics. She was active on the boards of several charitable Hungarian organizations. Since the 1950s, Eva and Francis regularly traveled to Hamilton, Montana to visit Francis' stepmother on her ranch the Bitter Root Stock Farm. Eventually they took over the ranch, moving there full time in 2009. Eva passed away on December 27th with her husband holding her hand and her family at her side."

2010-01-10T00:00:00Z,"ADAMS--William Healey, 63 years young, passed away on January 3, 2010, after a two and half year battle with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). In an email to his daughter on New Year's Day, he said he would ""keep fighting."" Surrounding his bedside were his wife of 38 years, Ellen (Dale), his two children, Brooke and Beau. Bill Adams was born in Charlotte, North Carolina on November 16, 1946, the son of Mary Frances (Healey) and Thaddeus Adams. He was predeceased by his parents and his two brothers, Thaddeus and Douglas. Bill Adams grew up in Charlotte, was a star athlete in high school and was recruited to play basketball at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill) by the legendary coach, Dean Smith. Upon achieving distinction as a freshman, Bill was excused from basketball by Dean Smith when the coach discovered that Bill had lost a kidney playing football in high school. Coach Smith remained a mentor and close friend throughout Bill's life. After graduating from UNC in 1969, Bill moved to New York where he joined the Bank of New York. In 1976 Bill Adams and Ellen moved to San Francisco, where he helped to open the corporate branch of the Chemical Bank. The Adams family, now including Brooke and Beau, moved back to New York in 1981. However, their experience of living in San Francisco was to draw them back in 1984. Prior to his current position as a managing director of Chilton Investment Company, he was the CFO of the Bank of San Francisco and managing director at Bankers Trust for its Pacific Rim private banking. Bill's athleticism was aptly demonstrated on the golf course. He loved the competition and the camaraderie inherent in golf. He was a member of the San Francisco Golf Club, the Cypress Point Club, the Burlingame Country Club and the US Seniors Golf Association. In addition, he enjoyed his friendships at the Pacific Union Club and in New York at the Brook and the Racquet & Tennis Club (where he was an accomplished squash player). While at UNC, Bill Adams was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and the Lodge. Despite being afflicted with ALS, Bill Adams established and was central to the William H. Adams Foundation for ALS Research, which actively supports ongoing research in the effort to find a cure for ALS. Since its formation in 2008, the Foundation has contributed over $1 million to fund cutting edge research under the sponsorship of Dr. Jeffrey Rothstein at the Packard Center at Johns Hopkins. One of Bill's most cherished moments was the August 31st, 2009 ALS fundraiser organized by the Adams Foundation and hosted by golf legend, Tom Watson. Bill Adams was devoted to his family, and their time together, both at home and traveling, was most important to him. He is survived by his wife Ellen, his two children, his daughter's husband, Zach Read, and two grandchildren, Isabelle and William (""Briggs"") Read. There will be a memorial service at 3pm on Thursday, the 14th of January at St. Ignatius Church in San Francisco. In lieu of flowers, donations in Bill's memory can be made to the William H. Adams Foundation for ALS Research, Deutsche Bank Alex Brown, 101 California Street, 46th Floor, San Francisco, California 94111, attention: Lisa Walsh."

And as the article correctly reported, Senator Kennedy served 46 years -- not 47 as the correction said.

2010-01-11T19:46:26Z,"The Wall Street Journal has a fascinating article today by Yaroslav Trofimov about how the U.N. is working in rural Afghanistan to vaccinate kids against polio -- and carrying letters from Mullah Omar to protect them from local militants and fundamentalists. The laissez-passers from Mullah Omar are the only way for health workers to reach the more violent parts of rural Afghanistan in safety. It's obviously embarrassing to have to carry permission slips from the Taliban, but, hey, that's just the only way to work in those areas.I think that's a useful way to think about education in rural parts of Afghanistan as well. Some aid groups are already negotiating with the Taliban about putting schools in certain areas that the Taliban control. The biggest concern for the Taliban has been that boys and girls be separate and that the girls are taught by a woman. Their other big issue is that the school books can't have a photo of President Karzai. With those conditions they have, sometimes, been willing to allow girls' and boys' education. That's not going to work everywhere, and the Taliban will be more suspicious of schools than of vaccinations -- but I think it's worth trying in more areas. If NGO's can get some Taliban approval to work in some areas, that would be a step forward."

Branzi, who was part of the radical architecture studio Archizoom in the 1960s and was a co-founder of the Domus Academy, feels that in its quest for formal perfection, contemporary design has hit a self-referential brick wall. In these seemingly primitive, totemic pieces, he employs old wood beams (the ""big woods"" of the exhibition's title), semiprecious stones, mosaic and a new printing technology from 3M to search for the soul of design between the ancient and the modern."

The song begins with a finger-strummed nylon-string guitar, takes on horn-section harmony over wakeful rhythm and piano chords on every beat, and finally graduates to sumptuous pools of pedal-steel guitar, Neil Young in 1971 style."

The Ravens' offensive line may be able to push around the Colts' undersize-but-fast defense, but the Ravens' shortcoming all season has been their secondary, and that is a doomsday matchup against Indianapolis."

2010-01-11T00:00:00Z,"Cowboys (12-5) at Vikings (12-4) When Minnesota faded down the stretch of the regular season, the Vikings struggled to protect Brett Favre. The Arizona Cardinals sacked Favre three times and intercepted him twice, and now DeMarcus Ware and Anthony Spencer are on the way. The Eagles tried to triple-team Ware on Saturday night, leaving Spencer virtually untouched. The Vikings have a multidimensional offense, but if Dallas can get pressure without blitzing, Favre will struggle to find his rhythm. The Cowboys have allowed just 31 points in their last four games, and they overwhelm offenses when they can limit their penalties. That allows the Dallas running game to dominate the time of possession, as it did against the Eagles."

(Central Control) The Gilded Palace of Sin, a three-man band from Manchester, England, pays some attention to words and melodies on its debut album, ''You Break Our Hearts, We'll Tear Yours Out.'' Its songs are grim, sometimes gallows-humored tales that work the gothic-metaphysical territory -- death, violence, faith, despair, wandering, transcendence -- of songwriters like Nick Cave, the band's most obvious model. There's ''Mean Old Jack,'' a bluesy stomp about a serial wife killer, and ''Wedding Rice,'' a list of someone's transgressions intoned over glacially alternating guitar chords: ''I saw you desecrating bones/destroying home after happy home.''"

As small teams of Congressional staff members work furiously to hash out the final differences between the two versions, Congressional leaders and White House officials are trying to navigate an increasingly difficult set of competing demands while also fulfilling President Obama's top goals: that the legislation not add to the deficit, that it reduce long-term health spending and that it cost around $900 billion."

Cooke, above, had a string of soaring hits like ''Soothe Me,'' ''Wonderful World'' and ''Cupid''; was a mentor to Aretha Franklin; and earned the support of Dick Clark in his fight against racism. But his career was cut short in 1964, when, at 32, he was gunned down while in the company of a prostitute. This ''American Masters'' presentation chronicles his life and career, from his early childhood singing at his father's First Baptist Church in Chicago to his involvement in the civil rights movement, and asks what might have been.

The flutist, Mathieu Dufour, had been on leave from the Chicago orchestra when he joined the Philharmonic on a one-year trial basis, starting in September. But this month he told The Chicago Sun-Times that he had decided not to remain in Los Angeles, telling that newspaper that the Philharmonic has “no tradition there — no tradition of sound and no tradition of working together as a dedicated ensemble.” In an e-mail message to the Philharmonic’s musicians reported by the Culture Monster blog of The Los Angeles Times (latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster), Mr. Dufour wrote that he had returned to Chicago to have shoulder surgery and apologized for “having left the season so abruptly.” He also wrote that he was “grossly misquoted” by The Chicago Sun-Times, and added, “I sincerely hope that none of you have read it, but if any of you have seen it, I beg you not to pay any attention to it.” Andrew Patner, who wrote the report for The Sun-Times, told Culture Monster that he stood behind his reporting."

2010-01-12T00:00:00Z,"KELLMAN--Joseph, 90. A Legend in Chicago Business and Chicago Philanthropy. Joe Kellman, a titan of the Chicago business and philanthropic communities, died peacefully on Thursday, January 7, 2010, at his home in Texas. He passed away on his 90th birthday surrounded by his family. Upon retirement in 2001, he and his wife LouAnne moved to Southern California, where they were residing at the time of his death. Joe Kellman was born on January 7, 1920, and grew in the North Lawndale community of Chicago. In the 9th grade, Joe had to drop out of school to work in his father's glass shop. After his father's death, he and his brother Morrie assumed ownership of the business. When they dissolved their partnership in 1950, Joe took over two small retail glass shops and grew them into The Globe Group, the nation's largest privately owned auto glass replacement company. In 1999, Joe sold the company to Belron International. Joe's achievements in business were rivaled only by his charitable endeavors. He vowed never to forget his early beginnings and pledged to serve youth and their families in North Lawndale. His interest in boxing led him to open the Archie Moore Gym in 1961 at 1512 South Pulaski as an after-school boxing club for boys. Shortly after opening the gym, Joe realized that sports alone could not change a young person's life. In the mid 1960s, Joe, with the help of long-time friend Buddy Hackett, transitioned the gym into the Better Boys Foundation (BBF). Today, BBF serves some 800 boys and girls each year through licensed child welfare services, innovative out-of-school time programs, and college scholarships. Its operations are housed in a 30,000 square foot, state-of-the-art facility financed by the Joseph Kellman Family Foundation. The new BBF Center opened in 2008 and represents Joe's 50-year commitment to North Lawndale. In 1988, Joe co-founded with Vernon Loucks, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Baxter International, and Fred Turner, Chairman and CEO of McDonalds, the Corporate/Community Schools of America, the country's first corporate-sponsored school. His intent was to prove that the common business practices could be applied to public schools to improve learning. The Joseph Kellman Corporate/Community School in North Lawndale is now one of Chicago's best performing. Along with his successful business career, philanthropic work, and advocacy efforts, Joe also bred racehorses and promoted every major boxing event in the city of Chicago over a 20-year period with friend and partner Ben Bentley. His premiere racehorse was Shecky Greene, an internationally renowned sprinter that won the Eclipse Award as 1973 Sprint Champion, the same year he ran in the Kentucky Derby and set the pace for Secretariat in his record run. Joe Kellman lived a long and fulfilling life that he shared fully with his family and friends. Joe was predeceased by his daughter Celia (Cissy). He is survived by his wife LouAnne; sons Jack and Richard Kellman; stepsons Bill and Bruce Suggs; grandchildren Robert Saxner, Cindy DeMaio, Allison Cantrell, Colette, Jake, Olivia, and Stephanie Kellman, and Suzannah and Kye Suggs; and great-grandchildren Jaclyn, Dylan, and Brooke DeMaio, and Owen and Maeve Saxner. Joe Kellman will be remembered always as a man of exceptional integrity who was committed to equity of opportunity for all people. A public visitation will be held Thursday, January 14, 2010, from 10am-1pm at the Better Boys Foundation, 1512 South Pulaski Road in Chicago. Valet parking will be provided. A private burial service has also been planned. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions be made to the Better Boys Foundation, 1512 South Pulaski Road, Chicago, IL, 60623."

Robert attended Boston University and received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the San Francisco Art Institute. He was Associate Professor of Illustration at the Art Institute of Boston at Lesley College from 1994-2009 and Chair of the Illustration Department from 1996-2007. Prior to his tenure at The Art Institute of Boston, Robert taught at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. Robert believed in the significance of illustration as a vital political and educational force, a way for both children and adults to learn about their world. Robert received AIB's Faculty Award for Excellence in Teaching in 2007 and Lesley University's Impact Award in 2009. Robert's own work reflected his keen powers of observation, exploring the symbolism inherent in common objects and filling his insatiable appetite for places and their history. His illustrations, characterized by wry humor and an ironic perspective, appeared in The New York Times, The Atlantic, Time, Travel and Leisure, Playboy, Sports Illustrated, Games Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, Rolling Stone and many other publications. Robert illustrated two children's books: Count-A-Saurus by Nancy Blumenthal in 1989 and Nat, Man of 1000 Faces by Michael Chesworth, in 1991. In 2005, Robert wrote and illustrated Blockology: An Off Beat Guide to Lower Manhattan. Blockology provides unique insight to the character and architecture of 36 blocks below 14th Street in lower Manhattan. The New York Times called Blockology the ultimate love letter to the city. Its publication led to numerous presentations, interviews, and walking tours to share his knowledge and affection for the urban landscape and its rich layering of culture and history. Robert is survived by his wife of twenty years, Susan Scott, his daughter, Emili, his father, Felix of New York City, and his brother, Kenneth (Barbara) of Kenilworth, Illinois.

I grew up as a cellist, first playing solo Bach, then chamber music (I never particularly enjoyed playing in orchestras), and then, by high school, original composed or improvised music using a wired (or is that ""weird""?) transformed rock cello that I created by placing large headphones around the cello for amplification, then sending the sound through tape recorder loops and analog transformation processes."

And now the earthquake.Poverty always hugely magnifies natural disasters. I saw this first in the terrible 1991 cyclone in Bangladesh that killed more than 100,000 people. The poorest people lived in marginal areas, such as flood plains, and in flimsy huts that were immediately washed away. So they were killed. Those who were better off lived on firmer land in sturdier homes, and after the disaster they were able to afford clean water and medical care for their children. Frequently what kills people in these disasters isn't just nature but its interconnection with poverty, and in Haiti it's imperative to arrange not only the earthquake response -- digging people out of rubble -- but also a public health response by controlling disease and assuring access to clean water for survivors."

2010-01-13T00:00:00Z,"MY mother broiled a mean steak, but it was never better than when she was able to coax a tri-tip out of the butcher. She faced two challenges when buying this cut. First, there is only one per cow, so it is not all that common. Second, it goes by so many (often incorrect) names -- California cut, Newport steak, sirloin tip, sirloin butt, culotte, bottom sirloin, top sirloin and more -- that it's sometimes a bit of work just to make it clear what you want. I prefer the term tri-tip, which I believe to be not only correct but descriptive, because the steak is triangular and is the tip of the sirloin. This ultra-thick, nicely marbled, strongly flavored steak is perfect for roasting, broiling or a combination of stove-top and oven cooking. It's wonderfully suited to this practically instant version of romesco, the Catalan sauce more commonly used with fish. (If you can't find tri-tip, use any thick cut of sirloin, or even steaks from the not-too-flavorful fillet, which will be helped immeasurably by the romesco.)"

The Jets hail from the league's biggest market. It may seem as if the N.F.L. is playing favorites, but it's not so: divisional-round schedules were determined on Jan. 4. That raises the question: If the N.F.L. is able to determine wild-card dates and start times after the final action in Week 17, why aren't the divisional-round dates and start times determined after the final action in the wild-card round?

''Jerk'' is a one-man puppet show of sorts from France that explores the real-life serial killings by Dean Corll and two young accomplices in Texas in the early 1970s. Jonathan Capdevielle, the performer, and Gisèle Vienne, the director, interpreting text by Dennis Cooper, probably think they're invading the audience's comfort zone in the way that bracing theater often does. Apparently they're not aware that a zillion other artworks about serial killers have already worked this territory to the point of numbness."

Another will string dead rivals from bridges or burn their genitals. Recently, hit men removed the face from a dead man and sewed it onto a soccer ball. On Tuesday, Mexican authorities announced the capture of one of those who they said had been active in this game of one-upmanship, Teodoro Eduardo García Simental, described as a ruthless drug lord based just south of the American border in Tijuana.

2010-01-13T00:00:00Z,"Personal reminiscence and Israeli history are woven into a dense, occasionally impenetrable cinematic poem in Amos Gitai's film ''Carmel,'' whose title refers to the mountains near Haifa, Mr. Gitai's native city. The film begins with a prologue in which Mr. Gitai, pictured in stills, is shown strolling alone on a beach to the strains of a Mahler symphony. Then it abruptly plunges back in time to a crude re-enactment of the Roman siege of Jerusalem in the first century A.D., when the future emperor Titus and his army destroyed the city and its temple. The strife is evoked by dissolving multiple exposures of clashing soldiers as the actress Jeanne Moreau reads from a French translation of an account by the Jewish historian Josephus. The English subtitles, read in the background by an announcer, create an echo-chamber effect that suggests the similarity between then and now. Nearly two millenniums later the weapons of war may be different, but to Mr. Gitai's immense sorrow and frustration, the same kind of savagery persists."

Born December 28, 1921, in Paris, as the third of nine children of the Count and Countess Boula de Mareuil, she led a privileged life until the onset of World War II. Her older brother, Camille, was an organizer of the Normandy resistance who was captured early in the War. His notoriety forced the rest of the family to disperse and added to the struggle and hardship that Edmee experienced during the War as she raised her two youngest siblings. After the war, Edmee completed her studies at the Sorbonne and took a job with Life Magazine. At a Fourth of July party at the American embassy in Paris in 1950, she met Howard Schless, a Philadelphia Quaker, Harvard graduate and decorated veteran of the Tenth Mountain Division. They were married in 1951 and eventually moved to New York, where he was on the faculty of Columbia University. They were married until his death in 1997. Edmee taught French and Latin at the Nightingale Bamford School in New York, where, to a generation of young women, she was simply known as ""Madame"". After moving to New Canaan in 1974, Edmee became head of the languages department at St. Luke's School, from which she retired. Throughout her life, Edmee was a passionate student of European history, particularly French history from the Crusades to the Revolution. She led numerous French language book groups, participated in forums for peace at the UN and was an avid bridge player. She traveled extensively, and regularly alternated between her houses in New Canaan and Lectoure, a town in the southwest of France close to her family's ancestral home. Survivors include her three children, Ghilaine Marino, of Concord MA, Nicole, of Madison CT, and Eric, of Old Greenwich, CT; her six grandchildren; and four of her siblings. A funeral service will be held at the Benedictine Grange at 45 Dorethy Road, West Redding, CT at 11am on Saturday, January 16. Donations may be made to the New Canaan Library in Edmee's name."

(13) PASSING STRANGE In 2004 the singer-songwriter who goes by the name Stew, above, collaborating with Heidi Rodewald and Annie Dorsen, created this semiautobiographical rock musical about a young black man who leaves behind his middle-class, churchgoing upbringing in 1970s Los Angeles to travel to Europe in search of his identity, or what he calls ''the real.'' The result is a series of misadventures with sex, drugs, politics and art in Amsterdam and Berlin -- and the discovery that love is the most real thing of all. Initially presented at the Sundance Theater Lab in Utah, ''Passing Strange'' was performed at Berkeley Rep in California and the Public Theater in the East Village before opening at the Belasco Theater on Broadway in February 2008. The show earned seven Tony Award nominations, winning for best book of a musical. Writing in The New York Times, Charles Isherwood said: ''Call it a rock concert with a story to tell, trimmed with a lot of great jokes. Or call it a sprawling work of performance art, complete with angry rants and scary drag queens. Call it whatever you want, really. I'll just call it wonderful, and a welcome anomaly on Broadway, which can use all the vigorous new artistic blood it can get.'' Spike Lee directed this ''Great Performances'' presentation. 8 P.M.

In the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Bykov wrote that some elements of ""Avatar"" were ""unequivocally reminiscent"" of the ""Noon Universe"" novels, and told The Guardian that ""the film is harmful for western civilization."" But The Guardian reported that the surviving Strugatsky brother, Boris, had not yet seen ""Avatar,"" and that he played down any reports that he was accusing Mr. Cameron of plagiarism."

In their experiments, they found that when the garments were disassembled and laid flat, their backs resembled traditional animal-skin rugs. Each rug is backed with felt and stamped with the BCXSY logo and a serial number for authenticity. At their introduction during Dutch design week in October, some of the rugs were snapped up by Rossana Orlandi for her renowned design store in Milan.

2010-01-14T00:00:00Z,"The federal government released its latest estimates of health spending last week, and they allow for some telling comparisons. In 2008, the United States spent $2.3 trillion on medical care, or 16.2 percent of gross domestic product and $7,681 per person. Of this $2.3 trillion, the federal government spent $817 billion, while state and local governments spent $290 billion. The tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance amounted to about $250 billion in lost federal revenue -- which is, effectively, a government subsidy for health care. Add up all of these sources, and you get about $1.35 trillion of health spending done by the public sector and slightly less than $1 trillion done by the private sector."

Now, two major changes have come to the 116-year-old church. On Tuesday, it achieved landmark status, bringing an end to a tumultuous quest for its preservation first undertaken by community advocates more than 20 years ago.

2010-01-14T00:00:00Z,"Recently we asked two policy experts of differing political persuasions why health care in America is so expensive and what the legislation emerging in Washington would or would not do about it. We posed the same question to Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, chairman of the Finance Committee and one of the leading architects of the Senate bill. Here is a condensed version of his response; the full version is posted online. ''Our health care payment system pays health care providers based on the number of treatments they perform, which creates an incentive for more care rather than better care. Insurance companies pay for every procedure a provider performs, and the more our insurance companies pay out, the more Americans are forced to pay in insurance premiums. Health reform shifts the payment system away from rewarding volume -- and toward rewarding value. And it places more emphasis on primary care and prevention, so we can stop expensive conditions before they become serious."

And while not all of those fatalities happened at night, even daytime runners can use the help of a jacket made with a reflective fabric that helps motorists take notice. These jackets -- which don't all come in day-glo colors -- are meant to reflect light from headlights and lampposts, making runners and cyclists more visible."

2010-01-15T08:11:12Z,"For over three decades, the photographer Bruce Weber has defined contemporary American glamour with his editorial and advertising imagery. Weber has also been a prolific producer of books, including ""All-American,"" an annual almanac of the esoterica that he encounters in his travels. But when he sat down last year to plan the next edition, the world appeared to have shifted on its axis, with many around him struggling to find their feet. ""I wanted to put together a series of stories as eclectic and inspiring as you might hear at a late-night party,"" Weber says, ""because the morning after, you feel a reason to continue, even if you don't know all the answers."" Fittingly, the ninth volume of ""All-American"" (Little Bear Press, $140) is a casserole of conceits, from poetry and photojournalism to profiles on the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade and the doomed beatnik pretty-boy artist Bill Morrow. As ever, nature is never far in Weber's search for the sublime: a paean to Big Sur features the strapping landscapes and characters that have made the place as synonymous with muscular naturalism as Weber himself."

Attributor, which works for publishers including Hachette Book Group and John Wiley & Sons, scanned 25 Web sites that offer readers downloadable content, looking for 913 titles across categories ranging from business and investing to fiction. It found, for example, that illegal copies of “Freakonomics,” by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, were downloaded 1,082 times and “Angels & Demons,” by Dan Brown, 7,951 times. The study did not track any titles published by the company’s clients, which would exclude the oft-pirated “Twilight” series published by Hachette.

To that list you can now add Russian filmgoers, who say the James Cameron movie too closely resembles a literary science-fiction series by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. The Guardian reported that the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda ran an article on Monday comparing “Avatar” to the Strugatskys’ “Noon Universe” books: both take place in the 22nd century on Pandora, and the alien species in “Avatar” is called the Na’vi, while “Noon Universe” chronicles a race called the Nave. In the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Bykov wrote that some elements of “Avatar” were “unequivocally reminiscent” of the “Noon Universe” novels, and told The Guardian that “the film is harmful for western civilization.” But The Guardian reported that the surviving Strugatsky brother, Boris, had not yet seen “Avatar,” and that he played down any reports that he was accusing Mr. Cameron of plagiarism."

His understudy, Morgan Spector, who has been standing in since Jan. 7, will take over the role. Rodolpho is an Italian immigrant who has entered the United States illegally and draws the ire of Eddie Carbone (played by Liev Schrieber) for courting his niece (Scarlett Johansson). While Mr. Fontana initially was believed to have been injured in a boxing scene between Rodolpho and Eddie, people involved with the production now say that he suffered the injury in another scene over New Year’s weekend. In the statement, Mr. Fontana said, “Knowing that I would not be fully recovered and able to return until after opening, I’ve chosen to withdraw with great respect to my fellow actors and to my own health.” Gregory Mosher, the director, said in the statement: “Santino is a wonderful actor; we’ll miss him, and we are tremendously grateful for his selflessness in this difficult situation. But I have every confidence in Morgan.” Mr. Fontana worked under Mr. Mosher in “Brighton Beach Memoirs,” the Broadway revival that closed a week after opening in the fall. “View” is to open Jan. 24."

The campaign allows users of mobile devices to make an instant donation of $5 to Mr. Jean’s Yéle Haiti foundation, a relief charity, by texting “Yele” to 501501. (The charge appears on the user’s phone bill.) In a statement, Matt McKenna, president of Red Fish, said “100 percent of the donations” go to the charity. Mr. Jean has tirelessly promoted the campaign on his Twitter account. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are among the other notable names who are contributing to relief efforts.

I used the thinnest, most flexible spatula I own, wedged it halfway under the pancake, letting the other half hang, then turned my wrist and gently laid it down on the other side. I recommend this over more aggressive flipping, which will tear the pancakes."

2010-01-17T00:00:00Z,"Theater Of all the soigné, quip-dispensing and unquenchably self-dramatizing characters created by Noël Coward, few came closer to self-portraiture than Garry Essendine, the beleaguered actor-protagonist in ''PRESENT LAUGHTER,'' the 1939 comedy that opens in revival this Thursday at the American Airlines Theater. ''Garry Essendine is me,'' Coward said, atypically disregarding grammar for the sake of emphasis. As Coward's biographer Philip Hoare pointed out, it wasn't so much Essendine's surface sophistication or narcissism as his appetite for control amid chaos that made him so revealingly like his creator. And actors throughout the years have had a high old time portraying Essendine's exquisite agony as his carefully ordered world threatens to crash down upon him: Coward himself, of course, but also Clifton Webb (in the play's belated Broadway debut in 1946), George C. Scott (1982) and Frank Langella (in 1996). Now Victor Garber takes up Essendine's cigarette holder and silk dressing gown in a Roundabout Theater Company production directed by Nicholas Martin. Though an assured Broadway veteran, Mr. Garber is probably best known as the not- quite-trustworthy authority figure from the television spy drama ''Alias.'' Expect him and Mr. Martin, who delivered a bracingly unconventional ''Hedda Gabler'' (starring Kate Burton) in 2001, to find some ambiguous shadows within Essendine's urbanity. 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundaboutheatre.org; $66.50 to $116.50."

2010-01-17T00:00:00Z,"Haitians have been migrating to the United States since even before their nation became independent in 1804, but the bulk came in waves driven by political repression and economic uncertainty, through the 1980s and 1990s. In 2008, nearly 800,000 Americans identified Haitian as their ancestry, and 522,000 said they were born in Haiti. There are 250,000 Haitian-Americans in the New York area. More than 75,000 live in Brooklyn, primarily in Flatbush and Flatlands but also in Canarsie, and nearly 40,000 in Queens, mainly around Cambria Heights; there are also concentrated pockets in Rockland, Suffolk, Essex and Fairfield Counties. They are more likely than other immigrants from the Caribbean to be naturalized United States citizens. Thousands of Haitians, mobilized by ethnic radio stations and other media, protested in 1997 against the police officers who brutalized Abner Louima, a 30-year-old Haitian immigrant, in Brooklyn.

2010-01-17T00:00:00Z,"LOHMAN--J. Frederic. Known to friends and family as Fritz, was born in Fort Wayne, IN in 1922. He graduated from Kenyon College in Gambier, OH and received his design training at Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design. After college he went to California where he worked as a set designer for Paramount Pictures and, with the advent of television, with the Dumont Corporation in the same capacity. He then came to New York as assistant decorating department manager of James McCreary & Sons, and later became an associate director of The Bertha Schaefer Art Gallery. In 1951, he established his own interior design firm, J. Frederic Lohman, Ltd., at 451 East 58 Street. Throughout a hugely successful career Fritz lent his design talents to both residential and corporate interiors. Notable on his long list of achievements was Wedgewood House, The Forum (high-rise NYC apartment buildings), the lobbies of The Criterion and The Bergen Mall theaters, the model houses for Reston, VA (Model Community of the Future) near Washington, DC, and the administrative center for Global Foods. Apart from his virtually innumerable residential and corporate environments in New York City and across America, his residential interiors are to be found in London, Vienna, Montreal, Geneva, Jamaica and Lagos, Nigeria. He created settings for UniRoyal, Dupont, and the American Cyanamid Company, and designed several of ""The Ten Best Dressed Rooms"" at The National Design Center. His American Standard bathrooms and many other promotional settings were regularly seen in national magazines. His atelier catered to a prestigious clientele which included Barbara Walters and the late French couturier, Jacques Fath, among others. Some years before he retired from design, closing his offices in 1984, he and his life partner, Charles Leslie, who he met in 1968, had established a small real estate holding company to acquire and restore neglected SoHo industrial buildings and to convert them for artists' housing. This was in 1969, the same year they mounted their first exhibition of homoerotic art in their SoHo loft. The better part of the next ten years embroiled them in battles with the city to change the zoning in SoHo--The Planning Commission was initially opposed--and to obtain landmark status for The SoHo Cast Iron Historic District from the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Along with others, Fritz was crucially instrumental in achieving both goals. In the 1970s, the couple became involved in the theater, producing several off and off-off-Broadway shows which included ""Naked Highway"" by Matt Creeger, a spoof based on old movies such as ""The Petrified Forest"" and ""Duel in the Sun"", which had a good run at the 7th Ave Playhouse; ""Men, Women & Why It Won't Work"" by Miriam Fond; and, most notably, ""Purification"", the only blank verse drama by Tennessee Williams, which had never before been produced. Williams, who was in the audience, praised the production. Although he continued to do work for old friends and clients long after he officially retired, his last major undertaking before that time was the restorative design and complete redecoration of the grand ballroom, the gold room, the hunt room, and the study of the 110-room Vanderbilt mansion, Idle Hour, as Oakdale, Long Island. The mansion belongs to Dowling College and is used for public, administrative and ceremonial functions. Inveterate travelers, Fritz and Charles covered the globe more than once and spent great blocks of time in Asia, Africa and--particularly--in Europe and Morocco. Continuously active in their support of gay causes and organizations (SAGE, The Center, Lambda Legal Defense, etc.) they founded The Leslie/Lohman Gay Art Foundation in 1990 to encourage the creation of and to protect art that is perceived to be gay and therefore endangered by societal prejudice. Fritz took great joy in their large extended family and the three little goddaughters they are putting through school, and the big goddaughter who has her MFA and is pursuing a successful career as an artist. His life was also enriched by their three homes--their New York loft, their country house on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and a beautiful, ancient Arab house in the medina of Marrakech in Morocco. Apart from Mr. Leslie, family survivors include five nephews, two nieces and their families. In lieu of other remembrances, it is asked that expressions of sympathy be sent to the Leslie/Lohman Gay Art Foundation (LLGAF) referencing the Fritz Lohman Museum Fund. As the co-founder of LLGAF, Fritz's name will now grace a new fund dedicated to the next significant growth phase--the establishment of The Leslie/Lohman Museum of Gay & Lesbian Art. Checks (payable to LLGAF) may be sent to: LLGAF, 26 Wooster Street, NY, NY 10013, Attn: Fritz Lohman Museum Fund."

2010-01-17T00:00:00Z,"Once glamorous, air travel has turned into a slog of security rules, long waits and cramped limbs. This is partly because so many more people fly today. In 1940, passenger planes in the United States carried only 3 million people, compared with 17 million in 1950 and about 650 million in 2008, according to FareCompare.com. Keep in mind, too, that in the early 1980s, shortly after deregulation, many of the cheaper domestic roundtrip tickets sold for $250 to $300, and the same is true today, said Rick Seaney, C.E.O. of FareCompare.com. So, adjusted for inflation, the cost of air travel has actually fallen."

2010-01-17T00:00:00Z,"BROMAN--Marguerite Morgan (""Peggy""), died December 23rd, 2009, in Framingham, Massachusetts. She was born in Revere, MA in 1915, the oldest of the six children of James Morgan and Eileen Glavin Morgan. She graduated from Emerson College in Boston, MA in 1937; and, like her father, she entered the retail business. In her twenties, she started the sportswear department at Arnold Constable (the department store, formerly at 38th St. and Fifth Avenue), which at that time catered to the ""carriage trade"", but wanted to appeal to a more youthful market; she became the sportswear buyer for the Manhattan store and its suburban branches. As her younger sister, Nancy, said, ""She carried the five of us on her shoulders""; all five of her siblings worked for the retail store early in their careers. In 1945 Peggy married Carl A. Broman, in Norfolk, VA. They were later divorced. Throughout her life, Peggy continued to work, while raising her two daughters. She was in the real estate business in Greenwich, CT; and she ultimately managed a retail business in Westport, CT, until her retirement in 1985. But Peggy's greatest achievement was as a pioneer in recognizing and addressing the needs of mentally challenged children and adults. She was an advocate long before that term came into vogue; she mainstreamed her child, both academically and in the workplace, long before it became a matter of course. Her tenacity and strong will set an example for other young parents faced with raising a special-needs youngster. Peggy was a fighter--to the end. She leaves two daughters, Nancy A. Broman, and Constance McCashin; her son-in-law, Sam Weisman; her two grandchildren, Daniel M. Weisman, and Marguerite K. Weisman; her two sisters, Nancy M. Boyle, and Winifred M. Taylor; and numerous nieces and nephews. Contributions in Peggy's memory may be made to The Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and Infirm, St. Patrick's Manor, 863 Central St., Framingham, MA 01701; or to The Abbey of Regina Laudis, 273 Flanders Road, Bethlehem, CT 06751."

But after nearly a month at the center of the debate about whether teams should rest their starters in meaningless games -- and whether their own history of shaky playoff performances suggested they made the wrong choice -- the Colts provided the answer: this time, it worked for them. The Colts beat the Baltimore Ravens, 20-3, in a somnolent American Football Conference divisional round game, the first time in four tries in the Manning era they have won a playoff game after having a first-round bye.

2010-01-17T00:00:00Z,"FOR over three decades the photographer Bruce Weber has defined American glamour with his imagery. Mr. Weber has also been a prolific producer of books, including ''All-American,'' an annual almanac of esoterica he encounters in his travels. But when he sat down last year to plan the next edition, the world appeared to have shifted on its axis, with many around him struggling to find their feet. ''I wanted to put together a series of stories as eclectic and inspiring as you might hear at a late-night party,'' Mr. Weber said, ''because the morning after, you feel a reason to continue, even if you don't know all the answers.'' Fittingly, the latest volume in the series, ''All-American IX: A Near-Perfect World'' (Little Bear Press, $140), is a casserole of conceits, from poetry and photojournalism to profiles of the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade and the doomed beatnik pretty-boy artist Bill Morrow. As ever, nature is never far in Mr. Weber's search for the sublime: a paean to Big Sur features the strapping landscapes and characters that have made the place as synonymous with muscular naturalism as Mr. Weber himself.

Joining him in the back seat were John Brennan, his new counterterrorism adviser, and two foreign-policy advisers, Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert. The three men with the president-elect were out of breath, having rushed more than a mile from transition headquarters on foot after failing to find a taxi in Washington's preinaugural madness. As the motorcade moved out, they updated Obama on gathering evidence of a major terrorist plot to attack his inauguration. After a weekend of round-the-clock analysis, the nation's intelligence agencies were concerned that the threat was real, the men told him. A group of Somali extremists was reported to be coming across the border from Canada to detonate explosives as the new president took the oath of office. With more than a million onlookers viewing the ceremony from the National Mall and hundreds of millions more watching on television around the world, what could be a more devastating target? ''All the data points suggested there was a real threat evolving quickly that had an overseas component,'' Juan Carlos Zarate, President George W. Bush's deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism, told me last fall. As the inauguration approached, signs of a plot ''seemed to be growing in credibility and relevance.'' Another senior Bush official involved in those tense events a year ago said that protecting the new president was not enough. Even a failed attack would send a debilitating message to the world. ''If something happens on the podium and there's chaos,'' this official told me, ''that's the first time you see the new president, and you really don't want that.''"

Earlier he was active in the painters' and the culinary workers' unions, and a target of McCarthyism.

As the story goes, he was visiting his linen-backer to restore some old Hepburn movie posters when the linen-backer asked if McCarthy knew Sean Hepburn Ferrer, the actress's son. ""He thought Sean might be interested in buying some of the posters,"" says McCarthy. And indeed, Ferrer bought a bunch of them. ""That was my first big sale."" The introduction turned into a job for McCarthy as an archivist for the Hepburn foundation, and it prompted him to start his Web-based gallery, offering up some of his 3,000 vintage movie posters for sale. Hollywood and design insiders have quickly caught onto McCarthy's astonishing collection of rare and foreign posters, many of them far more avant-garde than the standard-issue Hollywood versions. (Check out the Czech edition of ""Cool Hand Luke."") Besides continually adding to his collection, McCarthy (whose partner, Tyler Cassity, owns Hollywood Forever cemetery, where he hosts extremely popular movie nights in the summer) is planning a bricks-and-mortar gallery space to hold screenings and poster exhibitions based on particular stars, directors and genres."

After a lengthy rain delay, Wickmayer prevailed, 1-6, 7-5, 10-8, to reach the second round. Had she lost, it would have represented a major setback, even though she was not seeded here because of an unresolved dispute over her availability for drug testing. The match was interrupted several times by a summer rain that stalled many of the tournment's opening-day matches and eventually drove the two women off the court and into the locker room in midafternoon after more than three hours of play. Wickmayer is ranked 16th in the world and had defeated Dulgheru three times last year while climbing the ladder of women's tennis in the shadow of her Begian compatriots, Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters. But Dulgheru, a 20-year-old from Bucharest, fought tenanciously before yielding."

Now, for the first time at the Metropolitan Opera, he performs his newest role, for baritone, the title role of Verdi’s &apos;Simon Boccanegra.’ For this back-to-the-future adventure, Mr. Domingo will have the support of James Levine in the pit, and a cast including the tenor Marcello Giordani and the soprano Adrianne Pieczonka. Though the plot of &apos;Simon Boccanegra’ is nearly impenetrable, in its revised version, which is offered here, the opera is rich with first-class Verdi music.”"

It's a role that suits his bleary voice and his direct, unadorned lyrics. Mr. Everett stays mostly subdued on the Eels' eighth studio album, ''End Times,'' which he has bluntly described as a ''divorce album.'' In the title song, he sings, ''The world is ending/And what do I care/She's gone/End times are here.''"

It sputters alone for a while before a synthetic bass line fades into the mix, followed by a beat. ''What should we do?'' the voice asks breathily then, one minute into ''Looking for What,'' the album's opening track. ''Should we start? Should we stop? Should we stop looking? Looking for what?''"

Their winning percentage, .077, suggests they will win just six games this season and set an N.B.A. futility record, a mark now held by the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers, who went 9-73. The good news for the Nets is that this is not an accurate representation of what is expected to happen. Although the Nets have won just three games, a better way to predict their future performance is to use the team's offensive and defensive efficiency ratings. It is important to adjust the team's raw ratings based on their opponent strength and game location. This allows us to create power rankings that illustrate what efficiency ratings we would expect to see if each team played every other team once at home and on the road."

2010-01-19T13:35:37Z,"LONDON -- British book reviewers have gone all fluttery of late over ""Must You Go?,"" Lady Antonia Fraser's perfumed love poem of a memoir about her late husband, Harold Pinter. This portrait of marriage, which begins, ""I first saw Harold across a crowded room,"" is said to reveal the softer sentiments of a man known for stark dramas of human inhumanity. But you needn't buy Ms. Fraser's book to uncover a streak of gentleness in Pinter's makeup; that side of him is touchingly in evidence in the new production of ""The Caretaker"" that opened on Monday night at Trafalgar Studios, with Jonathan Pryce as the fetid old tramp Davies."

2010-01-19T13:16:46Z,"I love food, but I never actually wept over a meal until dessert at a former beer warehouse in Copenhagen last summer. I was at Madeleines Madteater - a kind of interactive dinner performance staged every few months in the neighborhood of Islands Brygge - eating nougat semifreddo while tightly wrapped together with a group of Danes in a stretchy white shroud, behind which waitstaff crept, caressing my back and pressing ghostlike faces through the fabric. There were lyrical strings and a dramatic chiaroscuro and a dancer undulating on the serving dais, and it was all gemütlichkeit, and ritual, and the sadness of endings, and - yes, I know this makes no sense. You had to be there. That is the point. It's art you experience with all five senses, the most satisfying performance in town. Madteater is precisely as its name translates: food theater.Unsurprisingly, Madeleines is named for Proust. The project, which started in 2006, is a collaboration between the chef Mette Sia Martinussen and the film production designer Nikolaj Danielsen, along with a board of directors that includes an anthropologist, a psychotherapist, a couple of artists and a neurology professor conducting research into the senses. But this is no gimmick; it's still very much about the food. Martinussen has long occupied a prime spot in the Modern Scandinavian cooking scene. She co-owned the experimental restaurant Ester & Soja with Claus Meyer, the chef of Copenhagen's beloved Noma. And in 2001 she and Danielsen opened a conceptual dining room called 1.th (""First Floor to the Right""), following it the next year with the experimental traveling restaurant MetteSias Sommerbus."

On Thursday evening Lady Gaga canceled a show she was to perform at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., writing on her Twitter account that she “was feeling dizzy and having trouble breathing” before the show and that she was later given a diagnosis of exhaustion and dehydration by paramedics. On Friday she taped an appearance on Ms. Winfrey’s show, where she discussed her upbringing, her personal life and her fans (and told the host, “There’s Gandhi, and there’s Oprah”) and also performed her song “Monster.” But that was the only performance that Lady Gaga would give for the weekend. The Star-Ledger of Newark reported that she canceled a show scheduled for Saturday at the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City. The concert promoter Live Nation said on livenation.com that a Lady Gaga show scheduled for Sunday in Wallingford, Conn., was canceled, and the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Conn., said one planned for Monday was postponed.

A weary-looking Mr. Jean, who was born in Haiti and recently returned from a visit there, said in the video that he had “always been committed to the people” of that country. He is scheduled to be a host of “Hope for Haiti,” a benefit telethon that will be on many networks on Friday. In a news conference on Monday, Mr. Jean reiterated his defense of the foundation. “Have we made mistakes before?” he said. “Yes. Did I ever use Yéle money for personal benefits? Absolutely not.” He added that the foundation’s books were “open and transparent,” and were given “a clean bill of health by an external auditor every year since we started.”."

According to his beloved wife Jacqueline, ""He was intelligent, witty, loving, and generous. His interests were wide reaching and diverse yet he dedicated himself 100 percent to everything he did and was bound by duty and by always doing what was right."" Jay's passions included flying, scuba diving, modern art and sculptures, collecting fine wines, and world history.

In 1982, Jay followed his roots in the Hudson Valley and joined his father John in the company his grandfather started 75 years before, Montfort Brothers, Inc. in Fishkill, New York. A meticulous and methodical man, his work ethic was incomparable. He started out as a machine operator in one of the factories and was named President in 2000.

The company employs over 100 people and is a leading supplier in the tri-state area. Jay was a successful residential land developer, as well. In 1998, Jay fell madly in love with Jacqueline Barlow. Although their time together was too short, they were blessed with two children, Alexander John and Elizabeth Dubois. The family resides in Fishkill, NY.

Jay was on the Council Committee of Storm King Art Center, and a member of The Holland Society of New York and The Cato Institute, Washington, DC.

2010-01-19T00:00:00Z,"McLAUGHLIN--Bethann, 46, passed away peacefully on January 15, 2010 at her home in Chestnut Hill, PA after a long and courageous battle with cancer. Bethann was born to George J. III and Clara Buff on March 29, 1963. She was a 1981 graduate of Haddonfield Memorial High School and attended Greenmount College in Vermont, receiving her BA degree in 1985. Bethann has lived in Chestnut Hill since her marriage to William McLaughlin in 1993. They enjoyed 16 years of marriage and welcomed twins, Schuyler and William into their lives on March 29, 2003, sharing a birthday with their mother. As a junior in high school, she founded ""BG's on the Beach"" in Stone Harbor, NJ, a boutique jewelry store. Upon graduation, she continued her love of retail and worked her way up to become Assistant Manager at Saks Fifth Avenue in their Center City, Philadelphia store. Together with her mother, the late Clara Buff, she co-founded other retail ventures including ""Cotton Comfort"", ""Linens for Less"" and ""Initial Gallery"", all of which had locations in Haddonfield and Stone Harbor, NJ. Bethann's life would seem too short to many, but those who knew her and were touched by her understood that her love of life and impact on others far exceeds the quantity of time in which she lived. Her sense of humor, compassion and generosity brought much joy to family and friends. True to her attributes of compassion and generosity, she was active in the American Cancer Society and a supporter of the National Institute of Health. She was a loving and devoted mother and the last six years since the birth of her children were years of great pride, joy and happiness. Cancer had unfortunately made several appearances in her life. In dealing with this challenge, Bethann's positive attitude, strength and courage was an inspiration to all who knew and loved her. Her love for life and family extended her time beyond what all who knew her thought possible. Bethann is survived by her husband, William and their two children, Schuyler and William, her father, George J. Buff, III, brother, George IV (Izabela) and nephew, George V. Friends and family are invited to visit with her family on Friday, 9:30 to 11:00am at the Haddonfield United Methodist Church, 29 Warwick Rd., Haddonfield, NJ, where a Celebration of Life Service will follow at 11:00am.

(49) COPYRIGHT CRIMINALS Long before the era of the video mash-up, hip-hop musicians were perfecting the art of audio montage through ''sampling,'' the reuse of previously recorded music in otherwise original compositions. Once lawyers and record companies got involved, the borrowed melody became a copyright infringement, with artistic expression facing off against the law. In this ''Independent Lens'' presentation Benjamin Franzen and Kembrew McLeod interview those who view sampling as pillaging and those who argue that the practice isn't new or unique to music. The interviewees include the hip-hop pioneers De La Soul, above, and Public Enemy; the funk innovator George Clinton; Jeff Chang, the author of ''Can't Stop Won't Stop''; and the drummer Clyde Stubblefield, who worked with James Brown and is one of the world's most sampled musicians. 8 P.M.

2010-01-19T00:00:00Z,"When watching a Hollywood movie that has robed itself in the themes and paraphernalia of science, a scientist expects to feel anything from annoyance to infuriation at facts misconstrued or processes misrepresented. What a scientist does not expect is to enter into a state of ecstatic wonderment, to have the urge to leap up and shout: ''Yes! That's exactly what it's like!'' So it is time for all the biologists who have not yet done so to shut their laptops and run from their laboratories directly to the movie theaters, put on 3-D glasses and watch the film ''Avatar.'' In fact, anyone who loves a biologist or may want to be one, or better yet, anyone who hates a biologist -- and certainly everyone who has ever sneered at a tree-hugger -- should do the same. Because the director James Cameron's otherworldly tale of romance and battle, aliens and armadas, has somehow managed to do what no other film has done. It has recreated what is the heart of biology: the naked, heart-stopping wonder of really seeing the living world."

2010-01-20T12:13:52Z,"There are excerpts in ""Shocking True Story"" (Pantheon), a new history of the infamous and influential celebrity-scandal rag Confidential, that should strike you as straight out of a James Ellroy novel: the built-up glitz and the hard-boiled sleaze, to start, as well as something about the language - full of implication and insinuation, and as tart and pulpy as a blood orange. The author, Henry E. Scott, writes in the book's acknowledgments that he was reading Ellroy's ""L.A. Confidential"" when he became inspired to write about the magazine - which for five years in the 1950s incited paranoia in Hollywood's bedrooms and boardrooms with tightly sourced, stylized accounts of celebrity indiscretion. At the New York-based magazine's height - which is to say just before its downfall at the hands of Tinseltown attorneys - it enjoyed a circulation of 9 million. Its pages laid the groundwork for the National Inquirer, E! and US Weekly; indeed, where once went Confidential, now goes TMZ.Not unlike an Ellroy novel, ""Shocking True Story"" sometimes delights in the macabre, particularly in the long passages it lifts from Confidential's pages. One article, from the magazine's November 1954 issue, could almost describe a Jacques-Louis David painting from 150 years earlier: ""Police found her nude body in the bathroom of her San Francisco apartment. There was a grim touch of neatness, even comfort, in the way she had met death. After filling the tub with water, she had arranged a stack of pillows around the edge and drowned herself."" The woman's name was Dr. Jean S. Tatlock, and she was a communist. She killed herself in 1944, some six months after an overnight rendezvous with her former boyfriend, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer. This wasn't news by late 1954, but it did endear Confidential's charismatic, power-peddling owner, Robert Harrison, to J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. and the forces of McCarthyism, who at a public hearing earlier that year stripped Oppenheimer of his Atomic Energy Commission security clearance."

2010-01-20T00:00:00Z,"The architect Bernard Tschumi has donated 43 drawings by his father, the Swiss architect Jean Tschumi, to the Museum of Modern Art, the younger Mr. Tschumi is to announce on Wednesday. Jean Tschumi, who died in 1962 at 57, helped influence modern architecture and design in the mid-20th century and became an influential figure in architectural education and practice. The works on paper range from Mr. Tschumi’s early work while a student in Paris to his last project, the Nestlé headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland. With this gift MoMA becomes the only institution outside of Europe to house a collection of drawings by Mr. Tschumi; the majority of his drawings are in the Archives of Modern Construction at the Lausanne Polytechnique, whose architecture school Mr. Tschumi founded in 1942, and in Basel in the collection of the pharmaceutical giant Novartis, formerly Sandoz, for which Mr. Tschumi built headquarters and laboratories in Switzerland and France. (Mr. Tschumi’s desk for the company director, above.) His notable works include the headquarters building of the World Heath Organization in Geneva. “I think he was very ambitious and at the same time a little ironical about the pitfalls of fame,” Bernard Tschumi said in a telephone interview from Paris on Tuesday. “I think he would have been extremely pleased, but with a twinkle in his eye.”."
2010-01-20T00:00:00Z,"“There are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told,” Edgar Allan Poe wrote in his 1845 short story “The Man of the Crowd.” And since 1949 one such secret has attended Poe’s final resting place in Baltimore at the Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, where a black-clad figure has shown up annually early on the morning of Jan. 19, the author’s birthday, to raise a Cognac toast to his grave and deposit three red roses, along with the remnants of the Cognac bottle. But the visitor — whose identity, or identities, has never been revealed, despite some claims to the contrary over the years — failed to show up this year for the first time, ending a strange crepuscular tradition and disappointing a crowd of more than 30 people who forfeited a good night’s sleep to witness the visitation. “I was very annoyed,” Jeff Jerome, curator of the Edgar Allan Poe House, told The Baltimore Sun. “I’ve been doing this since 1977, and there was no indication he wasn’t going to show up.” Some conjectured that the Poe Toaster, as the visitor has come to be known, might have just had the flu or car trouble. But Mr. Jerome spoke with a Poe-ian air of finality. Last year was the bicentennial of Poe’s birthday, he said. “And if it was going to end,” he said, “that would be the perfect time to end it.”."

The New York Cycle Club, the Five Borough Bicycle Club and Fast and Fab, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender bike club, are some of those that lead outings and other events year round. And while none of these was around at the turn of the last century, each traces its lineage back to the ubiquitous clubs that dominated cycling's early years. In the 1880s and 1890s, growing middle-class participation in cycling led to the formation of hundreds of clubs across the United States. The first to form was the Boston Bicycle Club, created on Feb. 11, 1878. The following February a club was formed in Buffalo. The first New York City club came in 1880, also in February (something about the cold seemed to drive riders to associate in those days, perhaps for the warmth of the pack)."

Bethann was born to George J. III and Clara Buff on March 29, 1963. She was a 1981 graduate of Haddonfield Memorial High School and attended Green Mountain College in Vermont, receiving her BA degree in 1985.

They enjoyed 16 years of marriage and welcomed twins, Schuyler and William into their lives on March 29, 2003, sharing a birthday with their mother. As a junior in high school, she founded ""BG's on the Beach"" in Stone Harbor, NJ, a boutique jewelry store.

Together with her mother, the late Clara Buff, she co-founded other retail ventures including ""Cotton Comfort"", ""Linens for Less"" and ""Initial Gallery"", all of which had locations in Haddonfield and Stone Harbor, NJ. Bethann's life would seem too short to many, but those who knew her and were touched by her understood that her love of life and impact on others far exceeds the quantity of time in which she lived. Her sense of humor, compassion and generosity brought much joy to family and friends. True to her attributes of compassion and generosity, she was active in the American Cancer Society and a supporter of the National Institute of Health. She was a loving and devoted mother and the last six years since the birth of her children were years of great pride, joy and happiness. Cancer had unfortunately made several appearances in her life.

Her love for life and family extended her time beyond what all who knew her thought possible.

His historic run was unreal . . . literally.My brother was and is a supporter of the unreal - a huge fan of science fiction's Godzilla. Thanks to him, when I was growing up I would catch an occasional episode of the TV show where Godzilla would take on Rodan (or some other nemesis) and they would end up in these knock-down, drag-out fights, reaping collateral damage all along the way. Once Godzilla went on his rampage, our eyes fixed on the TV, waiting to see which landmark would end up a pile of rubble. We loved it.

The Andaz property, part of an entirely new brand for Hyatt, is a far cry from last year's extremes of old-school opulence and flophouse chic. In June, the unabashedly luxurious Pierre Hotel reopened, flaunting a $100 million renovation and posting room rates of the ""if you have to ask ..."" variety. Then the Crosby Hotel opened, with each of the 86 rooms awash in bespoke fabric and art, and priced to match.

2010-01-21T15:41:30Z,"I took a brief leave of the catwalks to take in the annual SIHH luxury watch preview in Geneva. The packed hallways and buzzing booths were a welcome contrast to the quiet post-crisis scene a year ago. As usual there were the requisite one-upmanships between brands. Some innovations were astounding, others simply showy. There was an equally strong emphasis on heritage and brand DNA, with many companies focusing on line extensions, as they're called, or simply slight updates of existing styles. Some industry leaders took a break from bloat and put their watches on strict, chronograph-free diets, ""Biggest Loser"" style. Piaget's new Altiplano was recently named the world record holder for the watch with the thinnest automatic movement, as well as the thinnest automatic case. Rival Vacheron Constantin's new Patrimony Traditionale 1968 was named the world's thinnest manual winding watch. Finally, Baume & Mercier clocked in with its new Classima Executive, measuring only 4.4 millimeters thick, with a lean price of $1,490 for the quartz-movement watch. These three made strong, sleek statements that can hold their own against more ""complicated"" competitors. Cartier introduced the Montre Calibre, featuring a chunkier case and the first in-house-designed and in-house-produced automatic movement. A. Lange & Sohne's Zeitwerk Phantom was inspired by a dinner in the dark held in Berlin during the introduction of the original Zeitwerk. A UV-transparent coating allows the absorption of light by the numerals hidden beneath the face to glow in the dark. Audemars Piguet took cues from the car-racing world for its Royal Oak Offshore Grand Prix. The auto-inspired detailing and graphics, plus a dark forged carbon case and bright red anodized aluminum face, made for a racetrack-worthy watch. In one of the most innovative watches of the show, Montblanc introduced the Metamorphosis, a Transformer-style watch that has to be seen to be believed (and explained). This two-faced watch, the result of a collaboration between expert watchmakers, features two dials that separate to reveal two more hidden dials with chronograph functions. From the chic and seemingly simple to the innovative and complicated, this year's SIHH confirmed that the vitality of the watch business depends on tradition as much as innovation. "

2010-01-21T00:00:00Z,"In their latest filing with the Los Angeles Superior Court, lawyers for Roman Polanski on Tuesday said officials with the district attorney’s office had “intentionally misled the Swiss” government with a false record of Mr. Polanski’s long-running sex case as a way to secure his extradition from that country. The claim is included in a brief for a planned Friday hearing on whether Mr. Polanski, who in 1978 fled the United States before sentencing on a conviction of having sex with a minor, should now be entitled to sentencing in absentia. “Politics seems to be interfering with the just administration of the law,” wrote Mr. Polanski’s lawyers, Chad S. Hummel and Bart Dalton, in response to a district attorney’s brief arguing that Mr. Polanski should have to appear before sentencing. This month the Los Angeles County district attorney, Steve Cooley, formed a committee to explore a run for California attorney general. Tuesday’s filing did not specifically mention that possible run for state office, but it said the district attorney’s insistence that Mr. Polanski return to the United States was a “nakedly political” approach to the case. Los Angeles prosecutors have long argued that Mr. Polanski’s fugitive status deprived him of any right to challenge his treatment in California."

On Wednesday, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that it had signed Marc Webb, above, the director of the hit romantic comedy “(500) Days of Summer,” to direct a fourth installment in its “Spider-Man” franchise, The Hollywood Reporter said. Last week news emerged that Sam Raimi, the director of the first three hit films about Spider-Man, and his star, Tobey Maguire, who plays the Marvel Comics hero and his alter ego, Peter Parker, were leaving the franchise over creative differences. Sony had said that it wanted to return the film series to the teenage roots of the Peter Parker character. In announcing that it had hired Mr. Webb, the studio said in a statement that it wanted a director “who could capture the awe of being in Peter’s shoes so the audience could experience his sense of discovery while giving real heart to the emotion, anxiety and recklessness of that age.” The new “Spider-Man” film is being planned for a 2012 release, but no stars or screenwriters have been announced."

The accord, signed Wednesday by President-elect Porfirio Lobo of Honduras and President Leonel Fernández of the Dominican Republic, would allow Mr. Zelaya to travel and speak publicly. Mr. Zelaya, who was overthrown in a coup last June, called the proposal ''a good gesture'' and said he would study it, the Honduran media reported."

And so, to keep the smart phone from toppling off an elliptical trainer (''No really, Mr. Genius Bar, I swear I never dropped it.''), a phone-holding armband may be a wise investment. These armbands, which sometimes come with plastic windows that give the wearer access to the controls, are alternatives to pockets or the sloping face of a treadmill."

China's economy is surging forward even as many other nations, including the United States, are still trying to punch through the global recession. Over the whole year, the Chinese economy grew by 8.7 percent, surpassing the 8 percent growth-rate benchmark that Chinese leaders assert is necessary to maintain social stability. If China keeps up that growth rate, it will likely replace Japan as the world's second-largest economy by the end of this year."

2010-01-22T00:00:00Z,"LOHMAN--J. Frederic. Known to friends and family as Fritz, was born in Fort Wayne, IN in 1922. He graduated from Kenyon College in Gambier, OH and received his design training at Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design. After college he went to California where he worked as a set designer for Paramount Pictures and, with the advent of television, with the Dumont Corporation in the same capacity. He then came to New York as assistant decorating department manager of James McCreary & Sons, and later became an associate director of The Bertha Schaefer Art Gallery. In 1951, he established his own interior design firm, J. Frederic Lohman, Ltd., at 451 East 58 Street. Throughout a hugely successful career Fritz lent his design talents to both residential and corporate interiors. Notable on his long list of achievements was Wedgewood House, The Forum (high-rise NYC apartment buildings), the lobbies of The Criterion and The Bergen Mall theaters, the model houses for Reston, VA (Model Community of the Future) near Washington, DC, and the administrative center for Global Foods. Apart from his virtually innumerable residential and corporate environments in New York City and across America, his residential interiors are to be found in London, Vienna, Montreal, Geneva, Jamaica and Lagos, Nigeria. He created settings for UniRoyal, Dupont, and the American Cyanamid Company, and designed several of ""The Ten Best Dressed Rooms"" at The National Design Center. His American Standard bathrooms and many other promotional settings were regularly seen in national magazines. His atelier catered to a prestigious clientele which included Barbara Walters and the late French couturier, Jacques Fath, among others. Some years before he retired from design, closing his offices in 1984, he and his life partner, Charles Leslie, who he met in 1968, had established a small real estate holding company to acquire and restore neglected SoHo industrial buildings and to convert them for artists' housing. This was in 1969, the same year they mounted their first exhibition of homoerotic art in their SoHo loft. The better part of the next ten years embroiled them in battles with the city to change the zoning in SoHo--The Planning Commission was initially opposed--and to obtain landmark status for The SoHo Cast Iron Historic District from the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Along with others, Fritz was crucially instrumental in achieving both goals. In the 1970s, the couple became involved in the theater, producing several off and off-off-Broadway shows which included ""Naked Highway"" by Matt Creeger, a spoof based on old movies such as ""The Petrified Forest"" and ""Duel in the Sun"", which had a good run at the 7th Ave Playhouse; ""Men, Women & Why It Won't Work"" by Miriam Fond; and, most notably, ""Purification"", the only blank verse drama by Tennessee Williams, which had never before been produced. Williams, who was in the audience, praised the production. Although he continued to do work for old friends and clients long after he officially retired, his last major undertaking before that time was the restorative design and complete redecoration of the grand ballroom, the gold room, the hunt room, and the study of the 110-room Vanderbilt mansion, Idle Hour, as Oakdale, Long Island. The mansion belongs to Dowling College and is used for public, administrative and ceremonial functions. Inveterate travelers, Fritz and Charles covered the globe more than once and spent great blocks of time in Asia, Africa and--particularly--in Europe and Morocco. Continuously active in their support of gay causes and organizations (SAGE, The Center, Lambda Legal Defense, etc.) they founded The Leslie/Lohman Gay Art Foundation in 1990 to encourage the creation of and to protect art that is perceived to be gay and therefore endangered by societal prejudice. Fritz took great joy in their large extended family and the three little goddaughters they are putting through school, and the big goddaughter who has her MFA and is pursuing a successful career as an artist. His life was also enriched by their three homes--their New York loft, their country house on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and a beautiful, ancient Arab house in the medina of Marrakech in Morocco. Apart from Mr. Leslie, family survivors include five nephews, two nieces and their families. In lieu of other remembrances, it is asked that expressions of sympathy be sent to the Leslie/Lohman Gay Art Foundation (LLGAF) referencing the Fritz Lohman Museum Fund. As the co-founder of LLGAF, Fritz's name will now grace a new fund dedicated to the next significant growth phase--the establishment of The Leslie/Lohman Museum of Gay & Lesbian Art. Checks (payable to LLGAF) may be sent to: LLGAF, 26 Wooster Street, NY, NY 10013, Attn: Fritz Lohman Museum Fund."

2010-01-22T00:00:00Z,"When Lady Gaga finished her thumping, strobing, razzle-dazzle song-and-dance numbers at Radio City Music Hall on Wednesday night, she held her pose and kept the stage lights on, delighting her many camera-wielding fans. Her Monster Ball tour always provided something worth a snapshot: a sci-fi tableau, perhaps, or a skimpy, glittery costume. The more her image gets around, the better Lady Gaga does. ''Take my picture!'' she urged the audience, in her first of four sold-out shows at Radio City. ''I want to be a star.'' She is. A combination of well-planned outlandishness, media exposure and catchy, stuttering choruses -- ''pa-pa-pa-pa-paparazzi,'' ''p-p-p-poker face'' -- has made Lady Gaga a multimillion-selling, Grammy-nominated star in less than a year and a half since the 2008 release of her debut album, ''The Fame'' (Streamline/Konlive/Cherrytree/Interscope). Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, a k a Lady Gaga, sings, writes, dresses and apparently exists to toy with celebrity as performance art, seeing how freaky (in a fascinating way) she can be as she reaches a mass audience."

He graduated from the Rudolf Steiner School in 1975 and earned his B.A. at Williams College and his J.D. at Boston University.

He is survived by his wife, Virginia Earll Soybel, and their daughter, Anna, both of Boston, his parents, Renate and Arthur Soybel, and his sister, Carol Ann (Soybel) Bartges, of New York City, and his nieces and nephew.

They do not merely exchange glances; they mind-meld.

He would be world champion, No. 1, tennis player. No choice, any disagreement about that and you're punished, kid.

Catherine Hardwicke directed this unorthodox romance, based on the novel by Stephenie Meyer and a script by Melissa Rosenberg. Peter Facinelli assumes a ghostly pallor as Carlisle, Edward's doctor father and the head of a picture-pretty, well-behaved clan (played by Ashley Greene, Nikki Reed, Jackson Rathbone and Kellan Lutz) that, but for occasional hunting sprees, likes to think of itself as, uh, vegetarian.

The minarets, as pointed out, resemble missiles, and I would argue that the message conveyed isn’t that Sharia law is the next step, but that Switzerland will become a war zone.

Unfortunately tolerance, sweetness and reason tend to have far less dramatic images to promote them, and hence they lose in the battle for emotional resonance."

Add a white pilgrim's bonnet and a long apron, and Ms. Linney is transformed into the nobly suffering Elizabeth Proctor in Arthur Miller's ''Crucible.'' Dress it up with pearls, a slash of red lipstick and Manolos, and she is a high-strung Upper East Side wife in the 2007 film ''The Nanny Diaries.'' Include a scarf, a camera bag and a crutch, and she becomes Sarah Goodwin, the recuperating war photographer in Donald Margulies's new play ''Time Stands Still,'' opening on Broadway Thursday at the Manhattan Theater Club's Samuel J. Friedman Theater. Even Ms. Linney's pale scrubbed face, with nearly invisible blond eyebrows and eyelashes, invites one to draw in expressions, as if she has paint-by-numbers features. That shape-shifting quality, along with a puritan's work ethic, enables her to inhabit varied roles with the steadfastness of a rent-control tenant and has frequently brought rapturous reviews. Ben Brantley in The New York Times has called her ''an actress of peerless emotional transparency, capable of conveying a multitude of conflicting feelings through minimal means.''"

Love abounds in the family depicted in Darci Picoult's new play, ''Lil's 90th''; but the Eldridges are in big, big trouble anyway. The problem is Charlie, the family patriarch: affectionate, generous, proud and, alas, increasingly addled. His wife, Lil, his daughter, Stephanie, and his grandson, Tommy, should be busy spreading the safety net. But they are blinded by their love and too caught up in their own concerns to be watching out for him. Their kindly indulgence and inattention abet his mischief until it is too late to undo the damage."

Particulière, a mauve-y mushroom color that made its debut on Chanel's spring runway and instantly sold out on its Web site late last month. (It has just been restocked.) Much of its appeal stems from its wearability. Unlike Jade, Chanel's pistachio-colored earlier offering, Particulière strikes that perfect balance of being a little punk while remaining relatively subtle. ''It stands out without being a screaming color,'' Mr. Philips said. ''And it gives your fingertips a touch of class.'' For a similar look, for about a third of the price, try Chinchilly by Essie."

It was not yet noon, and Reid was in his second-floor corner office in an empty United States Capitol. He had arrived to bad news. Joseph Lieberman, the independent Connecticut senator, had announced on CBS's ''Face the Nation'' that he would not support the Senate health care plan, which meant that Reid did not have the 60 votes he needed. Lieberman's announcement, which torpedoed a compromise that Reid helped to midwife, caught the Senate majority leader by surprise. Reid had spoken with Lieberman two days earlier, and one of Lieberman's top aides participated in the Saturday-afternoon conference call that Reid orchestrates for Democratic senators who will be appearing on the Sunday talk shows. ''He double-crossed me,'' Reid said stiffly, associates later recounted. ''Let's not do what he wants. Let the bill just go down.'' Rahm Emanuel, the president's chief of staff, arrived at Reid's office not long afterward -- casually dressed, a cup of coffee in one hand -- and after a brisk meeting, a decision was reached: Reid would abandon his compromise, which was intended to appease proponents of a government-run insurance plan. The concession would not sit well with a lot of Democrats, not to mention the powerful constituency of union voters in Nevada, where Reid is up for re-election in November. But there was little discussion. Reid and Emanuel are exemplars of the just-get-it-done style of legislating. As it turned dark outside, Reid began pulling senators aside in the lobby just off the Senate floor, speaking in a strained whisper as he presented the case in characteristically pragmatic terms. ''I'm with you; I'm for you,'' he told Tom Harkin of Iowa, one of the Senate's traditional New Deal Democrats, who was pained that the public option was dying."

After serving as an officer in the U.S. Army in the Pacific during WWII, he completed an architectural degree at Carnegie Institute of Technology. He began his career working with Frank Lloyd Wright trained architects before establishing his own practice in New York City. A church, numerous temples, schools, community centers, and industrial buildings were among the many structures he designed. He later taught graphic design at the C.W. Post campus of Long Island University, eventually serving as Chairman of the Fine Arts Department before retiring in l989. His love of the arts, generosity of spirit, patience with young people and uncompromising standards made him an inspiration to all who knew him. He enriched our lives forever. A memorial service to celebrate his loving and creative life will be held at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation at Shelter Rock in Manhasset, NY on February 14th at 1pm."

''Le Tombeau de Couperin,'' Ravel's Impressionistic homage to French baroque music, will precede a performance of a recent flute concerto by the highly individual and dazzling French composer Marc-André Dalbavie, whose spiky modern music is steeped in a French sensibility for sound and color. Mathieu Dufour is the soloist. The main work is Bartok's bleakly gripping one-act opera with two singing characters, ''Bluebeard's Castle.''

2010-01-24T00:00:00Z,"In 1966, William Labov, the father of sociolinguistics, discovered that many people with New York accents -- the stock Noo Yawk kind -- didn't like the way they talked. It was kind of sad. Labov found widespread ''linguistic self-hatred,'' he reported. People from New York and New Jersey described their own speech as ''distorted,'' ''sloppy'' and ''horrible.'' No wonder those great old accents came to be regarded as a class giveaway, to be thrown over in the name of assimilation, refinement and the acquisition of Newscaster English. But that was the '60s, back before the never-ending you-tawkin-t'me aria was enshrined in movies like ''Mean Streets,'' ''Saturday Night Fever,'' ''Working Girl'' and, of course, ''Taxi Driver.'' Before long, people were consciously cultivating the once-despised dialect. Now an extra-hammy version of the accent -- which thrives in the New York City area, including northern New Jersey -- is a point of fighting pride, most recently among the brawling bozos on MTV's captivating and incendiary reality show ''Jersey Shore.''"
2010-01-24T00:00:00Z,"The title, in its deadpan, felt postmodern, or perhaps stamped by Warhol: ''Love Story.'' But irony did not rule the novel and film that made a deity of Erich Segal in 1970. Mr. Segal, who died last week, drew cackles back then -- Roger Ebert called the book's prose ''sort of a cross between a parody of Hemingway and the instructions on a soup can.'' But at a moment of generational strife, the story had balm-like powers. There was something for everyone -- a rich rebel son (Ryan O'Neal), a feminist working-class heroine (Ali MacGraw), a heartless capitalist who is redeemed (Ray Milland). ''Love Story'' worked, John Wayne is quoted as saying, not because ''the girl'' had a foul mouth but because ''the American public wanted to see a little romantic story.'' For one brief moment, America fell in love."

In it he plays a detective who goes on a revenge-fueled hunt for whoever killed his daughter. It is a plot that bears a resemblance to the story line of ''Mad Max,'' his first significant film, 31 years ago, in which he played a police officer who goes after the motorcycle gang that killed his wife and son. For Mr. Gibson it has been a circular trip back to where he started, with plenty of wrongs righted and bad guys laid low along the way. NEIL GENZLINGER"

An avid student of Italian Renaissance painting and sculpture, he contributed funds and support to the City of Florence, Italy, for the restoration of its flood-damaged artworks and manuscripts.

Republicans still face many obstacles, not least a number of potentially divisive primaries in coming months that will highlight the deep ideological rifts within the party. But in the days since Republicans claimed the Senate seat that Edward M. Kennedy had held for decades, upending assumptions in both parties about the political landscape for 2010, they have seen not just a jolt of energy and optimism but also more concrete opportunities to take on Democrats."

He was on his way to cleanse himself of a disappointing loss, a 30-17 defeat to the Indianapolis Colts in the American Football Conference championship game, but he had another task in mind, too. When he returned, the beard he had spent the previous five weeks cultivating was gone. Sanchez looked as young as he did that day last April, when the Jets traded up to draft him, but he is hardly the same quarterback. His superb performance at Lucas Oil Stadium culminated a stretch that turned him from weak link to bona fide strength. Of all the reasons the Jets did not advance to the Super Bowl -- Peyton Manning's brilliance; the Jets' weakened secondary; an injury to Shonn Greene; two missed field goals by Jay Feely -- Sanchez did not even register."

His voice, at 66, is still boyishly eager (except for the faintest quaver) and conveys the same soothing message: ''I am your friend through thick and thin.'' It is convincing enough to have made him as critically indestructible as Johnny Mathis, a singer whose voice projects a more ethereal version of the same reassurance. Their longtime popularity attests to a persistence of a belief in true love and happy endings, despite all evidence to the contrary."

Billed as the video diary of Liz Lee, a high school senior in Burleson, Tex., it registers more as a sitcom than a reality show -- it's so stylized and carefully planned and post-produced, it's the next best thing to scripted, if it isn't in fact a wholly scripted put-on. And that's the point. Ms. Lee and her producers have done an end run around teenage anonymity and preshaped her as Burleson's -- and soon, they hope, the world's -- own readymade C-list celebrity."

2010-01-25T00:00:00Z,"MOSBACHER--Robert Adam Sr.,Twenty Eighth United States Secretary of Commerce in the Administration of President George H.W. Bush, an accomplished oilman and industry leader, and a champion amateur sailor, died on Sunday, the 24th of January 2010, of cancer at the age of 82. Bob was born in Mt. Vernon, NY on March 11, 1927 to Emil and Gertrude Mosbacher and was the youngest of three children. He grew up in White Plains, NY before moving to Texas in 1948. He graduated from the Choate School in Wallingford, CT and Washington and Lee University. At a very early age, he established himself as one of the premier competitive sailors on Long Island Sound winning the 1939 Long Island Sound Midget Sailing Championship, and the 1941 and 42 Long Island Sound Atlantic Class Championships. He went on to amass a number of national and international titles. He was the only amateur sailor to win World Championships in three different Olympic classes. His sailing exploits and those of his brother, Bus, earned them a joint photo on the cover of the May 19, 1959 issue of Sports Illustrated. At the age of 21, and on the advice of his father, Bob moved to Houston with his first wife, Jane Pennybacker, to build an independent oil and gas company. The next decade would bring four wonderful children - Diane, Robert Jr., Kathryn, and Lisa. However, tragedy struck when his beloved Jane succumbed to leukemia in 1970. In the meantime, Bob built a highly successful energy exploration and production company with interests primarily in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. At different times over the past 50 years, the company has had profitable investments in the Rocky Mountains, Michigan, Canada, Spain, the Philippines, Venezuela, India, and more. Since 1950, Mosbacher has participated in the discovery and/or development of hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, and almost a trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The business has had the good fortune of a very dedicated and loyal group of employees who have shared in the successes, as well as the disappointments over the years. Bob is deeply grateful to his Mosbacher Energy family, both past and present, for their support. His decades of oil and gas experience, coupled with his astute business judgment, led others to seek his counsel, resulting in his heading a host of industry organizations including the National Petroleum Council, The All-American Wildcatters' Association, the U.S. Oil and Gas Association and others. Bob was long considered a consummate dealmaker who was always willing to take risk, but within acceptable parameters. Out of a deep desire to give something back to his country, he got involved in elective politics in the 1960's. Although he served as Harris County Chairman of the 1968 Nixon Campaign, it was his loyal friendship with, and devoted support of George H. W. Bush that would lead him to the national political stage. In fact, Mosbacher managed the national fundraising operations for five different GOP presidential campaigns - from Gerald Ford in 1976 to John McCain in 2008. He was regarded by friend and foe alike as one of the most effective political fundraisers in modern history, partly because of the respect he commanded as a business leader, and because he never asked others to support a candidate or cause he was not supporting actively himself. Following the 1988 election, he was asked by then President-elect George H.W. Bush to join his Cabinet as the 28th U.S. Secretary of Commerce. He was honored by the opportunity to serve his country and on February 3, 1989, he was sworn in by his close friend, Secretary of State James A. Baker, III, with President Bush looking on. His principal accomplishments while at the helm of the Commerce Department from 1989 until early 1992 included laying the foundation for the North American Free Trade Agreement, helping shrink America's trade deficit with Japan and South Korea, and aggressively promoting U.S. exports through the strengthening of the U.S. Foreign and Commercial Service of the Commerce Department. His role in helping negotiate NAFTA prompted Mexican President Ernest Zedillo to present Mosbacher with the ""Order of the Aztec Eagle,"" the highest decoration offered by the Mexican Government to non-citizens. He was particularly proud later in life to have served as Chairman of the Americas Society and Council of the Americas; on the board of the Naval Academy Endowment; and as founder and president of the board of the Odyssey Academy Charter School in Galveston. Just recently, he was honored to learn that the Robert A. Mosbacher, Sr. Institute for Trade, Economics and Public Policy is being created within the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University. Bob had a quick, warm smile, a wonderful sense of humor, and a fun-loving way about him that was contagious. He was deeply devoted to his family and felt that he was one of the luckiest men in the world to have been mentored by his father ""Pop"" along with respected business friend Max Fisher, and to have lived such an incredible life with a family he adored and friends like fellow oilman Chesley Pruet and his dear friend and lawyer, Randy Smith. His survivors include his wife of ten years, Michele ""Mica"" Mosbacher; sister Barbara Susan Mosbacher; daughter Diane and her spouse Nanette Gartrell; son Rob; daughter Kathi and her spouse Michael Wheeler; daughter Lisa and her spouse Downing Mears; grandchildren Peter (and wife Lucy), Jane, and Meredith Mosbacher, Parker, Whitney (and wife Katie), and Bayly Mears; stepson Donald Cameron Duncan III and his spouse Brittanie Hoster Duncan; stepsons Robert and Lloyd Gerry; a step-grandchild; as well as numerous nephews and cousins. His older brother, Emil ""Bus"" Mosbacher, passed away in 1997. Services in Houston are with Geo. H. Lewis & Sons, The Funeral Directors Since 1936, www.geohlewis.com, 713-789-3005. A celebration of Bob's life is to be conducted at 10am on Wednesday, January 27, at Memorial Drive Presbyterian Church, 11612 Memorial Dr. in Houston, TX. In lieu of customary remembrances, donations may be sent to the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (mdanderson.org), the newly created Mosbacher Institute at the Bush School at Texas A&M University (http://bush.tamu.edu/mosbacher/memorial), or the Odyssey Academy Charter School in Galveston (odyssey-academy.com)."

Born September 26, 1920, the youngest of five children of Patrick and Elizabeth O'Donoghue, he grew up with his extended family in Philadelphia during the Depression. He was an excellent student who graduated from St. Joseph's Preparatory School and attended Yale University on a scholarship, but left college after his freshman year and had no other higher education apart from his participation in the Advanced Management Program of the Harvard Business School in 1974-75. He had a broad-based career as a business executive with companies headquartered mainly in New York City, concluding his career as a senior executive of Springs Industries. After his retirement in 1986, he was active in non-profit agencies in Princeton, NJ, to which he moved in 1950. He married Joan Watson in 1949 and they had five children, Mark, John, Philip, Carol and Elizabeth. After Joan's death in 1992, he married Polly Pratt Green, who survives him, as do his children and their spouses, and six grandchildren (Anna, Tim, Aidan, Noah, Lily and Claire). His funeral service will begin at 10:30am on Tuesday, January 26, 2010, at St. Paul's Church, 214 Nassau Street, Princeton, NJ."

His captors have given him nothing but a lighter and a cellphone, which he must use to meet their ransom demand before he suffocates. Tagline: “170,000 square miles of desert. 90 minutes of oxygen.” “Buried,” sold by United Talent Agency, was a hot item for buyers going into the festival for several reasons. Genre films typically don’t have much downside — they are cheap to make and comparatively easy to market. And if that marketing is executed properly they can become phenomena with young audiences. (See: “Paranormal Activity.”) Although he has yet to show he can anchor a movie, Mr. Reynolds is a budding heavyweight.

In a ceremony on Monday the Southern Sky Column in Zhangjiajie City, in Hunan province, was formally renamed the Avatar Hallelujah Mountains, Reuters reported, citing the local government’s Web site (www.zjj.gov.cn/website/). The name change seemed to be an effort to stir the interest of Chinese tourists, who have helped “Avatar” sell more than $100 million in tickets, breaking box-office records in the country. Travel companies have already begun offering tours that emphasize the region’s resemblance to Pandora, the lush alien moon depicted in “Avatar.” On its site, the municipal government wrote: “Pandora is far but Zhangjiajie is near. Welcome to Zhangjiajie to see ‘Avatar’s’ Hallelujah Mountains and discover the real world of Pandora.”."

A man of determination, intelligence, and compassion, he was known professionally as a tireless champion of children with special needs. To us, his loved ones, he was a teacher and role model who instilled in us the virtues of integrity, dedication and humor. Burt was one of the funniest and wittiest people we knew, loving jokes pitched both high and low. His ability to spontaneously generate puns is unsurpassed. Burt was devoted to his family - his late mother Mary; son Perry; son Jason, daughter-in-law Lorie and their children Lucy, Zoe, and Millie; nephew Scott Cholewa; and dear partner Susan Gold. He was extremely proud of his three beautiful granddaughters, his partners in cake-baking and lesser crimes, as well as the happy subjects of his virtuoso photography. They will always remember his wild stories and their playful tugs on his beard. On all things medical, he was a font of wisdom and experience, the ""go to guy"" for advice, or an instant referral to one of his many brilliant colleagues and co-workers. A master tinkerer, Burt shared his many hobbies with us - photography, ham radio, electronics, computers - all self-taught to expert status. He was inveterately curious and a voracious learner. We will miss his sense of humor, his spontaneous puns, and his sunny disposition. But most of all, we will miss him. Funeral service is scheduled for Wednesday, January 27, 11:45am at The Riverside, 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave., NYC.

But Disney moonlighters can't take credit for this brash show; it comes from Britain via BBC America, the work of Damon Beesley and Iain Morris, who have a few ''Flight of the Conchords'' writing credits and a genuine feel for the awkward beast that is teenage life."

My mother, who was not a big reader herself, wrote a note saying I should be allowed to read whatever I wanted, which now seems one of her greatest gifts to me. That little piece of paper got me into the other, grownup side of the library, where I found a lot of books that opened my eyes and, I suppose, led me eventually to become a writer myself.

At least that's what happened to the Duplass brothers, Jay and Mark, the Austin, Tex.-based auteurs of the mumblecore genre (""The Puffy Chair"" and ""Baghead""). They hit Sundance this year with their first mainstream film, ""Cyrus,"" developed for and distributed by Fox Searchlight. The feature, their first to crack 90 minutes (""only because our credits are like five minutes long,"" Jay said) was largely improvised; it stars John C. Reilly and Marisa Tomei as a couple whose relationship is threatened by her adult son, Jonah Hill, in the title role. The Bagger liked it and so did many others at Sundance; it won unofficial best-of polls and even had some watchers talking Oscars - pretty heady stuff for a couple of dudes who made their Sundance entrée with what they called their ""$3 movie"" and cast their parents in the follow-up. The Bagger spoke with them in the plasticized courtyard of a hotel in Park City."

2010-01-28T17:02:34Z,"Fifty years ago, when the 26-year-old photographer Elliott Erwitt shot an advertising campaign for Puerto Rico, the island still held a sense of the exotic for American travelers. Nowadays, Old San Juan has a Marshall's discount store on one of its main plazas, and the island struggles to differentiate itself from other spots in the Caribbean - that is, as a place to hole up in a pool-side cabana between trips to the beach and the breakfast buffet. Which is why Puerto Rico tourism officials have commissioned Erwitt to reprise his 1950s shoot with a new portfolio of images intended to recapture some of the island's cultural allure (you can read about the campaign in Stuart Elliott's advertising column). It's yet more evidence - in addition to the recently revived grand-dame hotels and retro cocktails and velvety old-world passenger trains - that nostalgia is a powerful force in the travel world just now. Here's a look at Erwitt's photographs, then and now, the difference at times being poignantly hard to discern."

But not necessarily in a bad way. The event was billed as a send-off for ""Roy Lichtenstein, Meditations on Art,"" an exhibition of more than 100 works by the late Pop artist opening that day at the Triennale museum in Milan. But the 50 or so men and women milling around a red-carpeted 25th-floor meeting room sipping Pellegrino and speaking fluent Italish were there for what proved to be bigger news: the official announcement that the Triennale - the impressive 87-year-old design-focused institution - will open a New York satellite exhibition space, Triennale NYC, this spring.A live closed-circuit TV hookup with the Triennale in Milan - think giant projection-screen Skype - yielded a series of disconnections, pixelated greetings back and forth across the Atlantic (""saluti a tutti!"") and halting moments of unclear protocol, but the crowd took it all in with breezy bella figura. On the screen, there was the Triennale president Davide Rampello at the museum in Milan, and in the room an array of Italian-culture panjandrums, including the Italian Consul General Francesco Maria Talò, the RAI director Massimo Magliaro and Roberto ""Bobo"" Manzoni, a veteran Milanese businessman who has been guiding the Triennale's effort to scope out potential new locations, à la the Guggenheim, around the world. Manzoni said that a visit to MoMA in December 2008 gave him the flash of inspiration that allowed him to ""follow a dream"": to open Triennale NYC across West 53rd Street in what was the home of the Museum of Arts and Design (formerly the American Craft Museum) from 1986 until 2008, when it moved to new quarters in the remade 2 Columbus Circle."

2010-01-28T08:21:26Z,"In 1971 John Baldessari made a print of a text-based artwork that has become legend. It said, ""I will not make any more boring art,"" and the pioneering California conceptualist has been as good as his word. Baldessari's deadpan videos, paintings, photographs and assemblages, which he adapts from existing imagery, provoke laughter, puzzlement and admiration, often all at once. As both teacher and artist, he has inspired several generations of younger artists subscribing to his belief that anything goes in art and everything in the world can be fodder for making it. He ramps up his photographic works - photomontages juxtaposing multiple framed images drawn from television, advertising or film - by masking telltale noses, ears or eyes with floating, brightly colored dots. Museums and collectors have invested in his unique products for a very pretty penny. Now comes a complete compendium of his more affordable limited-edition works, of which a new book, ""John Baldessari: A Catalogue Raisonne of Prints and Multiples, 1971-2007,"" is one."

2010-01-28T00:19:20Z,"Tonight, President Obama presented a compelling defense of his strategy to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Following my deployment to the northeastern region of the country in 2006-2007, I arrived at many of the same conclusions as he has over recent months. I believed that the faltering mission required a revamped approach, more troops, and more resources. Dealing with the dysfunctions of the U.S.-led effort, serving in an overstretched unit and suffering casualties in my platoon prompted my initial diagnosis. However, time, distance, and perspective from my experience have forced me to reconsider this assessment.President Obama's goals are sound. Training Afghan security forces, rewarding good governance, reducing corruption, supporting the rights of all Afghans, and strengthening the international coalition are vital to the fight against Al Qaeda. However, a fatal flaw plagues the counterinsurgency strategy adopted by the president: the more the U.S. and its allies deepen their involvement and commitment in Afghanistan, the more they undercut the Afghan sense of ownership, accountability and sustainability that will determine the long-term fate of the mission. Simply put, his strategy is directly at odds with his goals."

The store’s atmosphere “has the effect of making its superbly made (and astronomically priced) fetish accouterments look respectable.” If bondage, however well-heeled, is still not your thing try Agent Provocateur, only a few of blocks away from Kiki de Montparnasse, but “considerably closer to the old 42nd Street in spirit.” The vibe is “more user-friendly for embarrassed guys shopping alone and packs of teenage girls; the lights are brighter, the music is dumber, louder and younger. Many items fall into a black and pink, rockabilly hot-rod style. It is, in essence, a vamped-up version of Victoria’s Secret by way of Johnny Rockets, the retro diner chain.” Either way, remember that “Valentine’s Day was originally a time to ritually exorcise evil spirits and restore one’s city to health and fertility,” so do your civic duty.
