Take away the career statistics of Washington Coach Glen Hanlon, a former goaltender, and those of Phoenix Coach Wayne Gretzky, and the remaining 15 played a collective 9,257 games, compiling 5,150 points but also 8,429 minutes in penalties."

But by the time the rate of growth in real G.D.P. has fallen, say, from 4 percent to 2 percent, and then to actual declines, growth in businesses' sales and corporate profits, the stock market, and even employment usually has slowed significantly for at least a year, often more."

2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"The United States Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal of recent lower court decisions invalidating New York's clubhouse-controlled judicial election system, but not until the next term. As a result, the legal pressure to come up with a replacement for the discredited election process by the end of the current legislative session has been lifted, greatly diminishing the chances that Albany will act. The silver lining, if there is one, is that Gov. Eliot Spitzer and state lawmakers can now devote more attention to other court reform issues: Judicial pay. New York State judges have gone without a pay raise since 1999, putting their compensation level near the bottom rung nationally, and way behind that of the underpaid federal judiciary. In addition to the catch-up increases Mr. Spitzer has included in his proposed budget, lawmakers should heed Chief Judge Judith Kaye's call for a new manner of setting judicial compensation, with the goal of severing the link between judicial and legislative pay that gave rise to the current problem."

He has been retired from track and field for 10 years, but at 45, his hair graying, he still looks fit and is still talkative and opinionated. FRANK LITSKY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF TRACK AND FIELD NOW? -- It's in trouble, but that's not a bad thing. We can build the sport up. I would like to be part of the effort because people know me. WHY SHOULD THE SPORT APPEAL TO YOUNGSTERS? -- It has so many great things going for it. Kids now have computers, but they still want to play games. Track and field is the best way to reach out for kids. It doesn't matter how fast you are. You always want to beat someone. WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE COMPETING NOW? -- No. I don't want to go back. I had my time. I was in it for a long time. I did it all, and I don't want to do it anymore. Now I'm doing a lot of other things. WHAT OTHER THINGS?

Ms. Young appeared to have achieved the same effect in Paris last year with her new piece, ''Snow White,'' which sold out within hours after a storm of Web postings reported that there were, um, acts of a sexually explicit nature. This week ''SNOW WHITE'' comes to the Kitchen, and if it exhibits the same combination of rigorous control and anarchic energy that characterized ''Michael,'' it may be well worth seeing. That piece suggested that Ms. Young is not (or perhaps not only) interested in shock for shock's sake but in how far the boundaries of performance can be pushed. Quite far, it seems.

As part of the 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Festival, Mr. Gotheiner is making a new work, ''GERTRUD,'' a tribute to his first dance teacher, Gertrud Kraus, a seminal figure in Israeli dance history. Also on the program is his recent version of Stravinsky's ''Noces,'' well worth a second look after its premiere last year.

2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"For years, the British director Peter Whitehead has been a legend among a rarefied group of cinéastes. Now the rest of us will be able to enjoy his work. A documentary about his life, ''In the Beginning Was the Image,'' by Paul Cronin, will be screened this spring at the Tribeca Film Festival. Whitehead is best known for his rare footage of the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd in the 1960s, though it was his cinéma vérité style that deftly captured the shifting tides of his era. In ''The Fall,'' a Godardian stew of art and politics in America, Whitehead documented the 1968 student protests at Columbia University; the kaleidoscopic ''Tonite Let's All Make Love in London'' (1967) immortalized the swinging London scene, including players like David Hockney, Julie Christie and Michael Caine. More handsome than most of his pop-star subjects, the Cambridge-educated Whitehead squired plenty of groovy glamazons: Nico, Nathalie Delon, Niki de Saint Phalle and Dido Goldsmith. By the end of the decade, however, he had dropped out of the scene to raise falcons and later went on to write esoteric novels. Now that his films are once again on the festival circuit, perhaps it's time for a proper bow. MAURA EGAN"

Starring American actors -- Jay Hernandez and Jason Scott Lee -- and featuring lots and lots of gore, the film is a window into another world, with a sweeping view of the country's vast, arid landscape and a visit to its warrior past.

They were of no help with anything beyond the occasional cockroach. Since then, there have been countless similar unexpected intrusions -- a bat hanging from the ceiling in the hallway one August night, and a wren that flew into my office one May afternoon when I had left the door open. And our house -- or attic, anyway -- is hospitable to snakes. A few years after we moved in, as painters were preparing to paint our roof, they came across a two-and-a-half-foot corn snake curled up under the chimney flashing. When they tried to grab it, it slithered into a crawl space and, presumably, back into the attic. It has not been seen since."

2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"MARGARET DEEGAN SLYWKA knows painfully well what happened 33 years ago, the last time the clocks changed to daylight saving time in the winter. Then a 14-year-old sophomore living in Seymour, Conn., she was hit by a car while walking to high school on Jan. 7, 1974 -- the day after President Nixon ordered that clocks be moved ahead an hour -- and she ended up in a coma for two weeks and a body cast for months. Ms. Slywka (pronounced sa-LEW-ka), now 48 and living in Middlebury, recovered but says that the only details of the accident that she can recall are those that others have told her. ''I can't even remember getting up that morning,'' she said."

2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: The Times accuses our synagogue, Congregation Bnai Yeshurun, of ''meddling in foreign policy'' by hosting a housing fair for potential new residents of the biblical lands of Judea and Samaria in modern Israel (editorial, March 4). The settlement of Jews in the land of Israel is to us the fulfillment of a biblical commandment. The Times unhelpfully chose merely to repeat the same tired rhetoric of settlements constituting an ''obstacle to securing peace.''"
2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"MY mother spent the summer of 1971 testing every variation on Bohemians, pastrylike cookies that she made with walnuts or pecans or no nuts at all. My twin brother, Bill, and I were the lucky tasters. We decided which batches were the lightest, chewiest, best. It was as if we had formed a small, secret club that met from June to September whenever my father was at work. Ma was trying to win the grand prize ($25,000 at the time) in the Pillsbury Bake-Off. And we believed she would. On summer weekdays, to free up time for baking, she established a solid routine. Bill and I watched an ''I Love Lucy'' rerun, ate breakfast and went outside, the screen door locked behind us. We had the run of a patio, an above-ground swimming pool and a clubhouse fashioned from an old pup tent. We could return for a bathroom break, if absolutely necessary, but my mother didn't discourage going in the bushes. We ate our lunch al fresco and Ma always served homemade lemonade."
2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"THE National Steinbeck Center, at the top of Main Street in this farming community, exhibits an array of artifacts from John Steinbeck's life and works: family memorabilia, a passport from the 1960s and movie stills from ''The Grapes of Wrath.'' Downstairs, in a climate-controlled vault, is the original manuscript of ''The Pearl,'' his novella published in 1947. There is also an exuberant letter that Steinbeck wrote to a distant relative when he was a teenager, as well as rare footage of him on 16-millimeter film, introducing a 1961 movie, ''Flight.'' Steinbeck aficionados wishing to examine the manuscript of ''The Pearl,'' which he wrote in pencil in small, precise handwriting on a yellow legal pad, have to travel here -- after making an appointment with a part-time archivist, who is in on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays."

2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Regarding ''Ships Are Rocking More, and Not From Waves'' (Feb. 25): I was disappointed in the blinders Dan Levin obviously put on when researching his article about the Rock Boat. My best friend and I have signed up for the boat in six of its seven years, and we are also signed up for its eighth. What draws so many people back every year? It isn't the boozing. It is the music (the chance to see favorites and to discover new groups), and the family that has developed from those who go year after year. Mr. Levin's depiction of the Rock Boat as a place where binge drinking is a ''major pastime'' was inaccurate, and he should join us next year. We will happily show him what the cruise is truly about: great new bands and even better friends. Laura Cherny Charlotte, N.C."
2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"ONE NOT-SO-SMALL STEP The News -- China announced that it would launch its first lunar probe this year and be able to put a man on the Moon within 15 years. Behind the News -- Nearly 10,000 scientists, engineers and technicians are involved in the country's lunar exploration effort. China said the orbital probe would pave the way to placing a remote-control rover on the Moon's surface as a prelude to a manned flight. ''Rockets are ladders to space,'' said one top Chinese space official. Chinese scientists hope to use the Moon as a ''relay station'' to voyage deeper into space. NO IDOL, BUT NO. 1 The News -- ''Daughtry,'' the debut album of 27-year-old Chris Daughtry, a failed American Idol contestant, entered the week as the No. 1 rock album in the country. Behind the News -- A rocker with a shaved head, Daughtry finished fourth in a surprise on last season's show, voted off before an audience of more than 27 million as Paula Abdul struggled to keep her composure. But take heart, Paula. His album has sold 1.8 million copies in a sluggish market since its release 15 weeks ago, the fastest-selling rock debut album since Nielsen SoundScan first tracked music sales in 1991. CLEARING THE AIR The News -- The 27-nation European Union agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels in the next 13 years. Behind the News -- The union also committed itself to generating 20 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2020 and running 10 percent of its cars and trucks on biofuels. The deal was reached despite objections by least a dozen countries that the targets were unrealistic and too costly to achieve. Now comes the hard part as Europe gets down to the nitty-gritty of making those goals a reality. THE DANCE BEGINS The News -- Men's college basketball wraps up its week of division championships today and will learn tonight which 65 teams go to the Big Dance. The women's teams will be picked tomorrow. Behind the News -- Last week's tournaments began the annual mania known as March Madness. The winners get automatic bids to the single-elimination contest, in which powerhouses and Cinderellas battle to make the Sweet Sixteen, Elite Eight and Final Four. The survivors face each other for the N.C.A.A. championship. REAL MONEY The News -- The number of the world's billionaires rose to 946, according to Forbes magazine, which added 178 newcomers to its list of the world's richest people. Behind the News -- Forbes said strong equity markets and rising real estate and commodity prices helped push up the net worth of its billionaires by $900 billion to $3.5 trillion. Sixty percent made their money the old-fashioned way by earning it. Bill Gates is still on top, with $56 billion. The youngest? A 23-year-old German prince, Albert von Thurn und Taxis, above, worth $2 billion."

2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"I'm pleased that research is being done to ascertain the effects of disabled siblings on typically developing siblings (Karen Olsson, Feb. 18). I would, however, caution researchers to refrain from viewing the ''supersibling'' as a positive result of such a situation. Speeding up the development of traits like maturity, responsibility, empathy and tolerance in young people may rob them of their childhoods as they assume responsibilities and develop character traits well before the appropriate developmental age. The relatively young people studied deny discomfort with this. Ask them again when they are 40 or 50 and have a long-range perspective."

Greenberg, the former chief of the American International Group, who was deposed in 2005 after an accounting scandal, sold 400,000 shares of his stock in the company last week. At an average price of $69.86 a share, the sale was worth just under $28 million, larger than his $20.2 million sale of A.I.G. stock in October. Considering his huge holdings in A.I.G., $48.2 million worth of the stock isn't all that much. His remaining shares of A.I.G. are worth about $4 billion. JEREMY W. PETERS"

Seconds after being checked hard into the boards by the Rangers' Hollweg on Thursday, Simon struck Hollweg in the face with this stick. The blow knocked Hollweg to the ice for several minutes; he needed a few stitches to close a cut on his chin. Hollweg has since returned to the Rangers' lineup."
2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"The Mexican phenomenon of lucha libre -- Spanish for ''freestyle wrestling'' -- is more than just WWE en Español. ''Lucha Loco'' (Therapy Publishing), a new photography book by Malcolm Venville, illustrates luchadores so colorful that they make ''Nacho Libre'' look dull. The wrestlers cultivate frightening personae with bare chests and supervillain names like Apocalypsis and Histeria. Curiosities include Máximo, who colors his hair pink to match his tiny toga, and El Pandita, who dresses like a man-panda (a manda?). Almost all of them sport scary stylized masks, ranging from the animalized to the surreal (like Coco Rojo's futuristic punk-rock-clown design). Losing a mask in a fight is considered the ultimate humiliation. As one wrestler says, ''I'd like to be buried with my mask.'' PAUL L. UNDERWOOD"
2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"ONE of the first things you learn when you move out of the city is that the outdoors is bound to find its way in. My husband and I discovered this some 20 years ago after taking up residence in the house we had just bought. Our new roommate was a red squirrel, whose acquaintance we made within days. We had two cats, but they were urban transplants, too. Pete eyed the bewildered squirrel lazily from his comfortable perch on the sofa and blinked; Cosmo dashed under the bed and trembled. They were of no help with anything beyond the occasional cockroach. Since then, there have been countless similar unexpected intrusions -- a bat hanging from the ceiling in the hallway one August night, and a wren that flew into my office one May afternoon when I had left the door open. And our house -- or attic, anyway -- is hospitable to snakes. A few years after we moved in, as painters were preparing to paint our roof, they came across a two-and-a-half-foot corn snake curled up under the chimney flashing. When they tried to grab it, it slithered into a crawl space and, presumably, back into the attic. It has not been seen since."
2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"KEYES--Gary, artist, beloved son and brother, uncle and dear friend, died February 12, 2007, in Las Vegas, after a short illness. Born October 13, 1959, in Bay City, Michigan, Gary graduated with a Bachelor's from Kalamazoo College in 1982 and moved to New York City. In 1990 he opened a hand-crafted pottery company in Brooklyn. His work was shown at the Whitney Museum and galleries in New York, Long Island, and Provincetown. He recently turned his gift for gardening into a successful landscaping business. Gary was a gourmet cook, a voracious reader, and could complete the Sunday New York Times crossword in ink, in 30 minutes. He was a gracious host, wonderful friend and generous man. He is survived by his mother Ruth Keyes, his brothers Kevin and Derek Keyes, his sister Kristen James, and his nieces Miranda and Devon James. A memorial service will take place in the spring. For information contact agent064x@yahoo.com. He will be greatly missed."

The two were standing several miles from where the Battle of Hastings occurred in England, not at the actual site."

2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"In an effort to stem violence and gang activity, a Yonkers city councilwoman is proposing a curfew that would make it illegal for youths under 17 to be on the streets and in other public places at certain times of night. The curfew would begin at 10 every night and end at 5:30 a.m., except in June, July and August, when it would begin an hour later, at 11. Under the legislation, introduced late last year by Councilwoman Sandy Annabi, any youth found loitering during those hours would be detained by the police and could be ordered to perform community service. Parents could be fined up to $500 or ordered to do community service."

2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"GENTRIFICATION in Harlem has taken many forms, as the neighborhood has revived and celebrated its past, and last week it reached a new milestone: its first Upper East Side-style high-rise condominium tower, to rise 30 stories above the low-rise brownstones for which the nearby Mount Morris Park Historic District is known. The site is now a large hole in the ground. But the glass-and-brick tower will soon rise 310 feet on the edge of central Harlem, with 147 condos, 47 rental apartments, a 55-foot lap pool and a four-story church sanctuary with seating for more than 1,800 worshipers -- and a very tall reminder that Harlem is becoming more like the rest of Manhattan."
2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"HILLER--Frederic, beloved husband of Catherine Hiller, passed away on March 7, 2007, at age 91. Fred was born on October 20, 1915 in Brooklyn, NY. Forced by the Depression to leave high school in order to support his family, he became, on his father's death, the sole provider for his mother and three younger siblings. During WWII he worked as a ship welder and later served in the Merchant Marines. After the War Fred founded and built a thriving business in the clothing industry as one of the industry's first jobbers, retiring at age 73. A fashionable and understated dresser, Fred kept fit and trim through disciplined exercise and diet, forgoing golf, tennis and other athletic pursuits in favor of a passion for reading and painting. Though lacking formal education he is remembered for his keen intelligence, sharp wit and dry humor, voracious reading and travel worldwide. Throughout his life he demonstrated remarkable generosity to his family and friends. His love and support were unqualified and unstinting. His sense of humor and uncanny memory were legendary, as was his grace and flare on the dance floor. In old age and throughout his last illness he displayed the same qualities of kindness, humor, and even disposition. He is survived by his loving wife of 68 years, Catherine, his sons Lee and Richard, his daughters-in-law Bonnie and Marsha, his grandchildren Lauren, Ruth, Michael, Oliver and Caleb, their spouses Phil, David, Cara and Maya, greatgrandchildren Molly, Sarah, Simon, Naomi and Joshua, his brother and sister, many nieces and nephews and dear friends. He leaves all who knew him with years of wonderful and vibrant memories, and will be sorely missed by all who loved him. Fred is simply irreplaceable.

2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"CON EDISON has been feeling the heat -- or at least I hope it has. Recent reports by the state's Public Service Commission have faulted the utility for the breakdown of numerous feeder cables during the power failure last summer in Queens and for not preparing and mobilizing quickly enough when powerful windstorms hit Westchester County in July and September. The Westchester cases, in which tens of thousands of customers lost electricity, some for more than three days, were primarily a communications and staffing problem that, while serious, should be easy for officials to resolve. The Queens blackout, which left 174,000 customers without power, some for as long as nine days, is more serious."

2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"Nonprofit organizations that receive government contracts are bound by the same pay-to-play disclosure rules as businesses, the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission said on Tuesday. Several nonprofit organizations protested the ruling, which they say will politicize charitable organizations and make recruiting board members more difficult, said Jeffrey F. Norman, a co-vice chairman of the Center for Nonprofit Corporations."

2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"Like a good neighbor, Martha Stewart didn't come empty-handed when she met with members of the Katonah Village Improvement Society last month at the Katonah Library. She brought a tray of her daughter's chocolate chip cookies and a letter from her lawyer defending her corporate use of the name Katonah. ''We ate the cookies, but we didn't drink the Kool-Aid,'' said Bill Tisherman, vice president of the society, a volunteer civic group."
2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"An article last Sunday about a book of photographs of Vidor, Tex., incorrectly referred to a killing as part of the town's legacy of racism. James Byrd Jr., who was dragged to his death near Jasper, Tex., in 1998, had not moved from Vidor the day before he died and was not a resident of Vidor. (Those were the circumstances of a different case involving Bill Simpson, one of four blacks trying to integrate a housing project there in 1993. He left Vidor after seven months, complaining of harassment. Hours after moving out, he was shot dead in Beaumont, Tex.) The article also referred incorrectly to the distance from Vidor to Fredericksburg, Tex., home to a painter who attended a gallery show of the photographs. Fredericksburg is about 300 miles away, not ''nearby.''"

2007-03-11T00:00:00Z,"KANTOR--Margaretha Clara Smulders, age 81, died on March 6, 2007. Born and raised in Indonesia of Dutch parents, Lily and Bernardus Smulders. She survived four years in a Japanese internment camp during WWII, where her strength of character and striking looks earned her the nickname, ''The White Angel'' which to this day she is known by among the survivors who gather each year in Amsterdam, a reunion she helped organize. After the war she became a KLM airline stewardess and eventually the spokes-model for KLM during the ''glory days'' of flying and favorite model of the late Dutch photographer Paul Huff. Emigrated to New York in 1960, she met and married Norman Kantor in 1965, her devoted husband of 42 years. One of her great passions was tennis which despite a debilitating kidney disease that plagued her for the last 10 years, she played with ferocity, especially at net, with people half her age right up until her last week. Another great passion was the New York Times, who may have lost its most devoted reader of the last 30 years. As someone who was unable to get a higher education because of her circumstances during the war, she managed to educate herself well beyond many grad students, by her almost religious devotion to this newspaper. She read it cover to cover everyday, including Sundays and shared what she learned with all by mailing dozens of New York Times clippings each week to her friends and family. She even had two Letters-to-the-Editor published. She is survived by Norman, her two children, Steven Kantor and Clarissa Taylor, and her four grandchildren, who she adored, Chloe, Caroline, Ben and Jack. She was one of those rare people who saw beauty in everything around her, especially in nature, and helped foster that love and appreciation in her children and grandchildren. Known to her friends and family as Toetie, she will be deeply missed by all. We love you, Mom."

Iraqi officials said this was the largest celebration of the holiday in decades. Bush Continues Tour in Uruguay President Bush continued his tour of Latin America in Uruguay, meeting with President Tabaré Vázquez, a left-leaning leader who has shown a willingness to buck the anti-American push of regional strongmen. 4 In Colombia, the president's next stop, a scandal tying paramilitary death squads and drug traffickers to close supporters of President Álvaro Uribe threatens to overshadow Mr. Bush's brief visit. 4 Hungary's Rallying Cry During protests in Hungary last October, the government put up barriers around Parliament.

Couples and sociologists say that often it has to do with snoring, and getting a good night's sleep. 1 Iraqi Refugees in America As the violence rages in Iraq and tens of thousands flee to neighboring countries, a small stream of Iraqis is trickling into the United States despite improbable odds. 20 NEW YORK/REGION 29-34 Bridging a Muslim Divide The congregations of the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood in Harlem, serving African-Americans, and the Islamic Center of Long Island, serving immigrants of South Asian and Arab descent, represent the largest Muslim populations in the United States.

I fear that Ms. Althouse doth protest too much. No one mentioned either ''licensing'' or ''control'' of bloggers, an idea I find to be anathema.

So I enlisted the help of Roger Kahlon, Hideki Matsui's interpreter, to teach me how to say, ""How does your arm feel?"" in Japanese.

But, because of Kahlon's assistance, I now had a question to ask - and probably shock - any Japanese pitcher. While waiting to interview Sammy Sosa of the Texas Rangers on Sunday, I spotted Akinori Otsuka, a Japanese reliever. Finally, I had the chance to test my Japanese. I dug through my notebook, found the translation, repeated it to myself and then approached Otsuka. As soon as Otsuka heard the words, he smiled and said in English, ""My arm feels good."" He seemed pleased or amused or both that I had asked him a question in Japanese. I told Otsuka the background to my story and he nodded. We talked for a few more minutes and one thing was obvious: Otsuka's English was much better than my Japanese."

The error also appeared in an article in The Arts on Feb. 22 about books written by candidates, including “Profiles in Courage,” which then-Senator Kennedy wrote with guidance from Mr. Sorensen. (The Times has misspelled Mr. Sorensen’s surname more than 135 times in headlines and articles during the 50-plus years he has been a Democratic adviser and well-known author.)."
2007-03-12T00:00:00Z,"An article on Thursday about a court ruling terminating a lease on the site of the planned Atlantic Yards project near Downtown Brooklyn misstated the composition of a group that filed another case challenging the state’s right to condemn their properties under eminent domain law. The 13 plaintiffs in that suit include owners and tenants, not just owners. The article also misstated the reaction of Forest City Ratner, the developer of Atlantic Yards, to the ruling on the lease. Forest City said in a statement that it did not believe the ruling would have an impact on the project; it did not decline to comment."

2007-03-12T00:00:00Z,"A Political Memo article on Thursday about the challenges Rudolph W. Giuliani faces in running for president as a former New York City mayor referred incorrectly to the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, also a New York City mayor. He served more than 100 years ago, from 1901 to 1909; his presidency was not “almost 100 years ago.” And although he was indeed the last president born in New York City, he was not the last “born-and-bred New Yorker” to make it to the White House. His distant relative, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was born and raised in Hyde Park, N.Y."

2007-03-12T00:00:00Z,"A former worker at an assisted-living home was indicted on Friday on charges of stealing more than $300,000 from older and frail residents, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo announced yesterday. The worker, Frances Landrini, 36, of the Bronx, faces four counts of grand larceny and one count of scheming to defraud. She pleaded not guilty; her lawyer, Louis J. Reda, did not immediately respond to a request for comment last night. Ms. Landrini was a contract worker at the New Fordham Arms Home for Adults, a 35-bed home at 2915 Williamsbridge Road, where she helped residents pay their bills and conduct financial transactions. Over two years, Mr. Cuomo said, Ms. Landrini persuaded residents to sign blank checks, claiming that she would fill in the rest to pay the residents’ bills but instead cashed the checks or deposited them into her own bank account. Mr. Cuomo said Ms. Landrini fraudulently obtained and negotiated more than 150 checks from 12 residents."
2007-03-12T00:00:00Z,"The New York City Department of Education hopes to improve the high school graduation rate, but has not planned for enough seats to meet that goal, according to a report released yesterday by the city&#8217;s public advocate, Betsy Gotbaum. The report said the department has set a goal of having 70 percent of high school students graduate in four years, but its five-year, $13.1 billion school construction plan, which calls for the creation of 26,000 high school seats, assumes a graduation rate of only 46 percent. Andrew Jacob, a Department of Education spokesman, rejected the report&#8217;s findings. &#8220;The report is absurd,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;Our construction plan is adjusted annually to reflect projected changes in the graduation rate and demographic trends. We will create seats for all our high school students in whatever numbers they are graduating &#151; the more the better.&#8221;."

2007-03-12T00:00:00Z,"A City Council committee was expected to approve a bill today that would ban the use of nonwood bats in high school baseball games, according to Council officials. The measure, introduced by Councilmen James S. Oddo, Republican of Staten Island, and Lewis A. Fidler, Democrat of Brooklyn, is to be voted on by the full Council on Wednesday. The sponsors cited cases in which metal bats have been linked to serious injuries and, as evidence, research by the Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma. But at an Oct. 23 hearing, the city&#8217;s Department of Education opposed the proposal and the director of the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research said there was &#8220;no evidence that batted-ball injuries are a greater problem from aluminum bats as compared to wooden bats.&#8221; A second hearing was scheduled for this morning, before the committee vote."

The drums, strings and horns have a vintage production style, and Ms. Winehouse's tart voice and sly, sultry phrasing sound largely unprocessed. Then the anachronisms kick in, from current slang and beats that hint at hip-hop to four-letter words and blunt references to sex and drugs.

2007-03-12T00:00:00Z,"MIDWEST Probably the second-weakest region, with a strong No. 1 seed saving it from being the worst. This is the kind of region most likely to produce an unexpected Final Four team. No. 5 Butler, No. 6 Notre Dame and No. 10 Georgia Tech are all playing well. But look for Florida, which eased through the SEC tournament, to make it to Atlanta. GATORS FOR THE DEFENSE No. 1 Florida vs. No. 16 Jackson State Florida could probably scrape together five football players to advance in this one. * No. 8 Arizona vs. No. 9 Purdue Two completely different styles should make for a telling game. Go with Purdue. No. 5 Butler vs. No. 12 Old Dominion Butler, with wins over Notre Dame, Tennessee, Indiana and Gonzaga, will advance. * No. 4 Maryland vs. No. 13 Davidson Bob McKillop is a top coach, and he will get that elusive N.C.A.A. tournament victory. No. 6 Notre Dame vs. No. 11 Winthrop Winthrop Coach Gregg Marshall is 0 for 6. Look for that skid to continue. No. 3 Oregon vs. No. 14 Miami of Ohio Miami runs out of miracles after a miraculous 3-point shot won the MAC tournament. * No. 7 U.N.L.V. vs. No. 10 Georgia Tech Tech has better players and has quietly come on despite its A.C.C. tournament loss. No. 2 Wisconsin vs. No. 15 Texas A&M-Corpus Christi Behind the crowd in Chicago, the Badgers will roll to the Round of 16. UPSET SPECIAL Before losing to Wake Forest in the A.C.C. tournament, Thaddeus Young, left, and No. 10 Georgia Tech had consecutive victories over Boston College and North Carolina. A victory over No. 7 U.N.L.V. may be an upset in terms of seeding, but it really isn't one for those who follow the game. WHO'S HOT No. 6 Notre Dame played well in New York, despite losing to Georgetown in the semifinals. With Russell Carter, left, the Irish are a good-shooting team. No. 11 Winthrop will be a trendy upset pick, but not a wise one. This Notre Dame team has the personnel to make a Round of 16 run. WEST This is the strongest region, with perhaps the country's best team, U.C.L.A., lurking as a No. 2. Pittsburgh stumbles in after being blown out in the Big East tournament final. Don't be tempted by Duke's brand name; the Blue Devils are primed for an early exit. U.C.L.A., which doesn't have to leave the state, should reach the Final Four. CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY No. 1 Kansas VS. No. 16 Niagara Expect Kansas to break its two-year first-round skid against Niagara, the play-in winner. No. 8 Kentucky vs. No. 9 Villanova Kentucky should be able to handle a Villanova team that has been erratic all season. * No. 5 Virginia Tech VS. No. 12 Illinois Illinois, along with Stanford, may be the most controversial team in the bracket. No. 4 Southern Illinois vs. No. 13 Holy Cross This is a decent matchup for Holy Cross, but S.I.U. is much more athletic. * No. 6 Duke vs. No. 11 Virginia Commonwealth Duke's seed will be questioned even more when the Blue Devils lose. No. 3 Pittsburgh vs. No. 14 Wright State Pittsburgh has the firepower to avert an upset against a good Wright State team. * No. 7 Indiana vs. No. 10 Gonzaga Gonzaga, which has come together since the suspension of Josh Heytvelt, will win. No. 2 U.C.L.A. vs. No. 15 Weber State U.C.L.A. Coach Ben Howland will send home his alma mater without too much strain. UPSET SPECIAL It is remarkable that No. 12 Illinois has played so well considering its injuries. But Warren Carter, left, and the Illini have managed to come together at the end of the season. A second-round matchup of Illini Coach Bruce Weber against his old team, Southern Illinois, would be interesting. WHO'S HOT For No. 11 Virginia Commonwealth, the first-year coach Anthony Grant has taken off where Jeff Capel left off. With Wil Fameni, left, the Rams are an athletic and experienced team that made a stirring run to the Colonial Athletic Association title. Look for V.C.U. to topple No. 6 Duke. EAST Probably the second-strongest region behind the West; no team is hotter than Georgetown. North Carolina would have a potentially difficult team waiting in Round 2: Marquette or Michigan State. A North Carolina-Texas game in the Round of 16 would be a delight. Still, look for Georgetown to take advantage of its favorable draw. HOYAS PUT THE HEAT ON No. 1 North Carolina vs. No. 16 E. Kentucky With a West Virginia-style offense, Eastern will give U.N.C. fits before losing. No. 8 Marquette vs. No. 9 Michigan State Wait for updates on the thumb of Marquette's ace defender, Jerel McNeal. No. 5 Southern California and No. 12 Arkansas The Trojans' Tim Floyd should outcoach Stan Heath. No. 4 Texas vs. No. 13 New Mexico State Texas will win, but the Longhorns still have the toughest draw of any No. 4 seed. No. 6 Vanderbilt vs. No. 11 George Washington G.W. is a tempting upset pick here, but Vandy has played well lately. * No. 3 Washington State vs. No. 14 Oral Roberts The best bet for a long-shot upset, Oral Roberts can really score. No. 7 Boston College vs. No. 10 Texas Tech Should be one of the top first-round games. Jared Dudley should carry B.C. No. 2 Georgetown vs. No. 15 Belmont The Hoyas are so strong, it is hard to fathom them losing this game. UPSET SPECIAL No. 3 Washington State's methodical style meshes perfectly with Kelvin Sango, left, and Oral Roberts, which has the veteran personnel to play with the Cougars. No. 14 Oral Roberts has two veteran scorers -- Caleb Green and Ken Tutt -- and has finally received a decent seed. WHO'S HOT No. 2 Georgetown has won 16 of 17 games and routed Pittsburgh in the Big East tournament final. The Hoyas are a difficult matchup because of their Princeton-style offense, forward Jeff Green, left, and the 7-foot-2 center Roy Hibbert. Look for the Hoyas to make a deep run. SOUTH With a No. 1 seed that looks a bit dysfunctional on the court (Ohio State) and a mysterious No. 2 seed (Memphis), this region breaks well for Texas A&M. Numerous coaches say they haven't seen any teams playing better defense. The Aggies are experienced and have a go-to scorer in Acie Law. Expect them to reach Atlanta. SMOOTH ROAD FOR TEXAS A&M No. 1 Ohio State vs. No. 11 Central Connecticut Central will need to shoot from 20 feet out with Greg Oden in the middle. * No. 8 Brigham Young vs. No. 9 Xavier The Musketeers advance in this mini-upset because they are tournament-tested. No. 5 Tennessee vs. No. 12 Long Beach State The Volunteers have a pretty good draw to make a deep run. No. 4 Virginia vs. No. 13 Albany A surprisingly high seed for Albany, but Virginia will hold it off. No. 6 Louisville vs. No. 11 Stanford Stanford's inclusion in the bracket is almost stunning, and it won't last long. No. 3 Texas A&M vs. No. 14 Penn The Aggies guard teams so well that they'll be able to neutralize Penn's Ibrahim Jaaber. No. 7 Nevada vs. No. 10 Creighton This is the best game on paper in the first round; the Wolf Pack gets the edge. No. 2 Memphis vs. No. 15 North Texas No chance for North Texas; Memphis's up-tempo style should make this a blowout. UPSET SPECIAL No. 9 Xavier won nine in a row before losing to Rhode Island in the semifinals of the Atlantic 10 tournament. Look for Stanley Burrell, left, and the Musketeers to beat No. 8 B.Y.U. and create a compelling matchup with their former coach Thad Matta and Ohio State in the second round. WHO'S HOT Memphis is the country's hottest team, on paper, with 22 straight wins. And while its competition has been questionable, the results have been consistent. The key for Chris Douglas-Roberts, left, and his teammates will be poise in close games because they have played so few of them. ATLANTA NATIONAL SEMIFINALS Georgetown will continue its hot play and come out of the East to face defensive-minded Texas A&M, which will have home-court advantage in San Antonio. U.C.L.A. from the West will face Florida, which has put its uninspired play in the past. NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME Look for U.C.L.A. and Georgetown to play for the national title, with the Bruins overcoming last year's national title loss and bringing glory back to Westwood. * Upset chance"

They stormed to the Southeastern Conference tournament title, routing opponents by nearly 20 points a game. Joakim Noah's scoring average is down by about 2 points this season, but the junior forward Al Horford, left, remains steady inside. Florida is shooting a nation-best 52.7 percent from the field and looked like college basketball's top team for most of this season. WEST KANSAS (30-4) The fast-breaking Jayhawks have a dependable scorer in the sophomore Brandon Rush, and the versatile 6-foot-8 forward Julian Wright poses a serious matchup problem for opponents. Prone to turnovers in big games last season, the sophomore point guard Mario Chalmers, left, has reduced his miscues this season and has been solid of late. Unable to advance beyond the tournament's first round the past two years, the Jayhawks rank among the nation's best in field-goal shooting and rebounding, key ingredients to success. A potential second-round game against Kentucky looms. EAST NORTH CAROLINA (28-6) The success of the Tar Heels will hinge on the play of the freshman starters Ty Lawson, Brandan Wright and Wayne Ellington, who average a combined 37 points a game. But the sophomore forward Tyler Hansbrough, left, anchors this team, which is defined by deft shooting and strong rebounding. The Tar Heels are 21-0 when they shoot 50 percent from the field and 26-2 when they outrebound their opponent. A marquee matchup pitting Hansbrough against Texas' star freshman, Kevin Durant, is possible in the Round of 16. SOUTH Ohio State (30-3) The Buckeyes will rely on their dynamic backcourt, featuring the freshman point guard Mike Conley Jr., left, and the senior Ron Lewis. They also will count on the freshman center Greg Oden, who averaged 17 points in the Big Ten tournament after averaging 15.3 points in the regular season.

The New York Civil Liberties Union, which is suing the city on behalf of seven people who claim they were wrongly arrested and detained during the convention, had argued that intelligence reports and testimony from David Cohen, the deputy police commissioner for intelligence, should be barred because the city missed deadlines for disclosing that Mr. Cohen and the documents would be part of its defense.

In the case, Arthur Solomonyan, a 26-year-old Armenian who lived for a time in New York, and six others were charged in 2005 with arms smuggling and plotting to import military weapons for illegal sale. The prosecutors said they were ready to proceed without Mr. Davis, but defense lawyers said they wanted to question Mr. Davis about his role in the case. “He certainly is a key witness in the story that’s going to be told by either side,” Judge Holwell said, and he set a new trial date of June 4."

Martin Scorsese was nominated for an Academy Award for his direction of this film, but he drew plenty of criticism as well from those offended by a perhaps too-human version of Jesus subject to all kinds of temptations, including lust. Paul Schrader adapted the screenplay from the 1951 novel by Nikos Kazantzakis. Willem Dafoe is Jesus, Harvey Keitel plays Judas and Barbara Hershey is Mary Magdalene."

The Italian Senator Paolo Amato, above left, chained himself to a column outside the Uffizi Gallery in Florence to protest the loan of Leonardo da Vinci's ''Annunciation'' to the Tokyo National Museum, The Associated Press reported. Culture Minister Francesco Rutelli insisted on the loan, despite the contention of about 100 leading cultural figures that the piece is too fragile to travel. The 38-by-85-inch tempera on wood painting, which Leonardo did between 1472 and 1475, shows the archangel Gabriel kneeling before Mary and informing her that she will conceive Jesus Christ. It was insured for 100 million euros (about $125 million) and secured in a waterproof and fireproof case for the trip. The painting is to be shown from next Tuesday through June 17 as part of the Italian Spring festival, a series of events promoting Italian culture. ''The Annunciation'' has been on the road before, but not since 1945.

Last year Ms. Rourke directed Shakespeare's ''King John'' for the Royal Shakespeare Company's Complete Works Festival.

Muzzi was endlessly creative, constantly energized, and a problem solver who always found the way through the most convoluted maze and taught us how to have fun doing it. Muzzi's remarkable warmth and open spirit resulted in a world where once you spent an hour with him you felt as if he was your friend -and he was. For Muzzi, the glass was not merely half full, it was always overflowing. He made us all better and what we do and in who we are. To his wife, Sue, and to his children, Alexander, Christina and Sean, we loved him too, and will miss him dearly. Odyssey Investment Partners $(6$)MIRZA--Muzzafar ''Muzzi''. For the past 17 years, Muzzi was my colleague, partner and friend. We taught each other our business. We argued constantly, laughed uproariously, struggled through bad and good times, and in the end worked it out everyday. He was a living antidote to pessimism, and enemy to gloom, the champion of keeping our options open and lifting spirit. When we wandered, Muzzi was ''not confused''. I am not confused now, Muzzi. It was very, very special. Stephen Berger $(6$)MIRZA--Muzzafar ''Muzzi'', beloved father, husband, son and best friend to so many people, passed away at home in Greenwich, CT after a courageous battle with cancer, on Saturday, March 10, 2007. Muzzi was born in Lahore, Pakistan in 1958 and moved to the US in 1976. Muzzi is survived by his beloved wife of 18 years, Susan, his precious children Alexander, Christina and Sean, his mother Anis, brother Mustafa and his wife Liz and their children, mother-in-law Patricia Scribner, brother-in-law Mark Scribner and his wife Dawn, his sisterin-law Nancy Ruscheinski and her husband Edward, his loyal companion Midnight and many loving nieces, nephews, cousins and close friends. He was predeceased by his father Akbar Mirza and father-in-law Howard A. Scribner, Jr. Muzzi is simply irreplaceable - there will never be another like him. He leaves all of us with wonderful memories of joy and laughter and the gift of his love and extraordinary generosity. A unique combination of keen intelligence, clarity of thought, sharp wit and persuasive charisma led to his extraordinary success. He was a founding partner of Odyssey Investment Partners, LLC, a leading private equity investment manager, and was a principal in its predecessor firm, Odyssey Partners. He served on the Board of Directors of Aviation Technologies, Inc., Dresser, Inc., United Site Services, Inc., Neff Corp, Norcross Safety Products, LLC., and Tri-Star Electronics, Inc. Prior to joining Odyssey, Muzzi was the head of the merchant banking group at GE Capital Corporation. Muzzi began his career at Marine Midland Bank after graduating from Claremont McKenna College and obtaining a graduate degree from the American Graduate School of International Management. Muzzi exemplified Rudyard Kiplings ideal man, equally comfortable ''talking with the crowds and walking with Kings.'' His huge heart allowed him to embrace everyone he touched. His simplicity, warmth and legendary zest for life were contagious and changed many lives for the better. His passions included golf, cars, music, the ocean and ''the art of the deal.'' He was a great host and loved the company of family and friends. He was completely outrageous, but with his warmth and humor, he disarmed everyone from family and friends to colleagues and caddies. People loved being with him because he would inspire them with his own joy for life, lifting them beyond their own capabilities. Muzzi was a wonderful husband and father who loved and cherished his family. He was a willing accomplice to his children's mischief and laughter and would egg them on, as the biggest kid in the family. Until his last day he remained serene and composed, and never lost his optimism. He was completely at peace with himself. We will all cherish and miss him. Burial will be private. A public celebration of Muzzi's life will be held on March 29th at the Greenwich Hyatt at 11am. In lieu of flowers donations can be sent to the Muzzi Mirza Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund, to the attention of Dr. John Chabot, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Pancreas Center, 161 Ft.

Buyers of vacant land also often think big. The challenge, of course, lies in turning those dreams into reality. One reason is that buyers and owners must confront zoning limitations -- those rules in hamlets, villages, towns and cities across the country that can govern everything from the height of a house, to the number of structures allowed on the property, to distance of a home from the property line. Some municipalities even have rules about the size of the shadow a dwelling can cast on a neighbor's property."

The buildings extend through the block, to 20 and 22 Murray Street, between Broadway and Church Street. ''These distinctive examples of the mid-19th-century double-store-and-loft buildings housed a vast array of tenants, including one of New York City's greatest institutions, The Daily News,'' said Robert B. Tierney, chairman of the commission. Completed in 1857, they were designed by Samuel A. Warner, architect of the Marble Collegiate Church at Fifth Avenue and 29th Street, an early Romanesque Revival structure that is also a city landmark. With seven bays on Park Place and five on Murray Street, the buildings have ornamental window treatments and pediments inspired by the Farnese Palace in Rome. The continuous stone cornices are decorated by a frieze of alternating panels and roundels. Two cast-iron storefronts, at 23 Park Place and 20 Murray Street, are original. A surgeon and a merchant developed the buildings and leased them to a series of dry-goods stores through the early 1880s. They were later used by manufacturers, booksellers, restaurants and financial concerns. The Daily News, founded in 1919, leased the buildings from 1921 to 1930.

Mr. Stallone, left, and his entourage were stopped and detained at the Sydney airport on Feb. 16, when customs officials searched the group's luggage and confiscated some items. At the Sydney premiere of ''Rocky Balboa'' the next day, Mr. Stallone shrugged off the incident, calling it a misunderstanding, but clearly the Australian authorities felt differently. Lawyers for Mr. Stallone represented him yesterday in court, where he faced a charge of importing a banned substance. Prosecution documents said the airport search revealed 48 vials of Jintropin, which is considered a performance-enhancing drug in Australia and therefore cannot be imported without a government permit. The case was adjourned until April 24, when Mr. Stallone's lawyers will be asked to enter a plea.

2007-03-14T00:00:00Z,"LEFKOWITZ--Howard N. The attorneys and staff of Proskauer Rose, LLP, mourn the passing of Howard N. Lefkowitz, a senior partner in Proskauer's Corporate Department. We have lost not only a colleague and a friend but also a lawyer's lawyer who was known for his scholarship and pioneering spirit. In the 43 years Howard worked at Proskauer, he developed an impressive and diverse practice. A visionary in the emerging field of private equity, which would evolve into one of the firm's most active practice areas, he represented institutional investors-including Verizon, JPMorgan and others-in their investments in private equity funds that totaled in the billions. Nationally recognized for his work in partnership and limited liability company law, Howard authored the New York Limited Liability Company Forms and Practice Manual and co-authored Transactional Lawyers Deskbook: Advising Business Entities. He had extensive experience with alternative investment vehicles, and he lectured frequently on limited partnerships, limited liability companies and fiduciary obligations. In 2006, the American Bar Association presented Howard with the Martin I. Lubaroff Award in recognition of his work on partnership law. Howard, known for his love of the law, was a tremendous resource to his colleagues, who relied on his deep knowledge, particularly of New York law and Delaware partnership issues. As his friend and colleague Bruce Lieb remembers, Howard knew the answers to questions that many of us did not realize were questions. Howard retired in 2006 but continued to practice. He spoke and wrote frequently, and he contributed his professional time to organizations including the Private Investment Fund Forum, the ABA and the TriBar Opinion Committee. An expert on wine as well as the law, Howard enjoyed an extensive wine collection and contributed articles to food and wine magazines. Howard received his B.A. from Cornell University and his law degree from Columbia University Law School, where he was a Kent Scholar and an editor of the Columbia Law Review. Howard, who is survived by his wife, Midge, his two children and five grandchildren, will be greatly missed and affectionately remembered. Allen I. Fagin Chair, Proskauer Rose $(6$)LEFKOWITZ--Howard N., 70, born and raised in Utica, NY, now of New York City and Great Barrington, MA, died on March 12 of multiple myeloma. Survived by wife Midge; daughter Sarah and husband Ted; son David and wife Laurie; grandchildren Alex, Zachary, Adam, Anna Kate, and Talia; brother Manny and sisters Betty and Elinor; many nieces and nephews, and by a wonderful extended Sitrin family. Howard graduated Cornell University where he met Midge. Served as an officer in the US Navy in the destroyer fleet at Newport, RI, and graduated from Columbia Law School, where he became an editor of the Law Review and a Kent Scholar. Howard practiced corporate and partnership law at Proskauer, Rose, Goetz and Mendelsohn (now Proskauer Rose) his entire career of over 40 years, retiring as a senior partner in 2005. He enjoyed active participation in the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, the ABA Section of Business Law Parnership Committee, the Tri-Bar Opinion Committee, and the Private Investment Fund Forum. He insisted that his avid interest in, and consumption of fine wine did not hasten his demise. Funeral Wednesday, 12 noon, at Gramercy Chapel, 152 Second Ave. at 9th Street. Contributions to Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, 383 Main Ave, Norwalk, CT 08651, would be appreciated."

2007-03-15T00:00:00Z,"It Will Never Play In Tehran The blockbuster epic ''300'' is attracting plenty of enthusiastic moviegoers in the United States -- to the tune of $70 million in its first weekend -- but in Iran it's mainly drawing ire. Hollywood's depiction of the 480 B.C. battle between Greek and Persian armies at Thermopylae has been denounced, Reuters reported, by the Iranian government and numerous blogs. They complained about how their ancestors were portrayed in the film: the Persian army as far more ruthless and far less intelligent than the Greeks. The film, though newly released in the United States, has already shown up in Tehran in low-quality, pirated copies. Gholamhossein Elham, a government spokesman, called ''300'' an insult to Iran. ''Not only would no nation or government accept this,'' he said in a press briefing, ''but it would also consider it as hostile behavior.'' The One-Song Concert The Who's lead singer, Roger Daltrey, walked off the stage during the band's first song at a concert in Tampa, Fla., on Tuesday night, and the guitarist Pete Townshend then announced that the show would be canceled and rescheduled for March 25. A note on the band's Web site (thewhotour.com) said that Mr. Daltrey ''experienced vocal challenges as a result of a medical condition.''

Kendall of McKim, Mead & White, was designated a city landmark late Tuesday in a unanimous vote of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Built between 1912 and 1917 of concrete and brick, with a stucco finish and terra-cotta detailing, the Tuscan Revival-style building is capped by a cupola with slender rounded-arch windows. Robert B. Tierney, chairman of the commission, said it ''was one of the few buildings designed by the firm without landmark protection.'' Scot Medbury, president of the botanic garden, founded in 1910, said, ''It is both an extraordinary work of architecture and a living testament to early accomplishments in botany.'' Inscribed along an exterior frieze are the names of 68 plant scientists, including Darwin and Linnaeus. Inside is a resource center for gardeners, horticulturists and educators, administrative offices, a visitor center and an auditorium.

Muzzi was born in Lahore, Pakistan in 1958 and moved to the US in 1976. Muzzi is survived by his beloved wife of 18 years, Susan, his precious children Alexander, Christina and Sean, his mother Anis, brother Mustafa and his wife Liz and their children, mother-in-law Patricia Scribner, brother-in-law Mark Scribner and his wife Dawn, his sisterin-law Nancy Ruscheinski and her husband Edward, his loyal companion Midnight and many loving nieces, nephews, cousins and close friends. He was predeceased by his father Akbar Mirza and father-in-law Howard A. Scribner, Jr. Muzzi is simply irreplaceable - there will never be another like him. He leaves all of us with wonderful memories of joy and laughter and the gift of his love and extraordinary generosity. A unique combination of keen intelligence, clarity of thought, sharp wit and persuasive charisma led to his extraordinary success. He was a founding partner of Odyssey Investment Partners, LLC, a leading private equity investment manager, and was a principal in its predecessor firm, Odyssey Partners. He served on the Board of Directors of Aviation Technologies, Inc., Dresser, Inc., United Site Services, Inc., Neff Corp, Norcross Safety Products, LLC., and Tri-Star Electronics, Inc. Prior to joining Odyssey, Muzzi was the head of the merchant banking group at GE Capital Corporation. Muzzi began his career at Marine Midland Bank after graduating from Claremont McKenna College and obtaining a graduate degree from the American Graduate School of International Management. Muzzi exemplified Rudyard Kiplings ideal man, equally comfortable ''talking with the crowds and walking with Kings.'' His huge heart allowed him to embrace everyone he touched. His simplicity, warmth and legendary zest for life were contagious and changed many lives for the better. His passions included golf, cars, music, the ocean and ''the art of the deal.'' He was a great host and loved the company of family and friends. He was completely outrageous, but with his warmth and humor, he disarmed everyone from family and friends to colleagues and caddies. People loved being with him because he would inspire them with his own joy for life, lifting them beyond their own capabilities. Muzzi was a wonderful husband and father who loved and cherished his family. He was a willing accomplice to his children's mischief and laughter and would egg them on, as the biggest kid in the family. Until his last day he remained serene and composed, and never lost his optimism. He was completely at peace with himself. We will all cherish and miss him. Burial will be private. A public celebration of Muzzi's life will be held on March 29th at the Greenwich Hyatt at 11am. In lieu of flowers donations can be sent to the Muzzi Mirza Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund, to the attention of Dr. John Chabot, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Pancreas Center, 161 Ft.

Plus, there is always that one game that people get to work tomorrow and say, ''Wait a minute, TEAM X lost last night? They were up 12 at the half. What happened?''

2007-03-16T00:00:00Z,"The matter-of-fact, slightly laughable sculptures by the Brazilian Conceptual artist Tunga at the Luhring Augustine gallery look much like bedside lamps, except that they are 12 feet tall, with an assortment of objects about their bases: braided iron wire, zinc-galvanized iron nets, glass goblets, epoxy-resin skulls and animal bones, cast-aluminum canes, gold-mesh shoji screens and oversize insect wings made of soldered iron. What does it all mean? The sculptures probably wouldn't be worth pondering had this 55-year-old artist not made use of a remarkable talent for poetic juxtapositions and combined the ingredients in such a way as to suggest a delicate balance between order and chaos, form and formlessness. The effect is bewitching when it comes off, which is not always the case with the dozen or so sculptures on display through March 24. The best emit an enigmatic glow, while others look as if they might collapse in a sudden heap with a snap of the fingers. One of the sculptures that feels fully resolved is ''La Mouche'' (2007), right, which in its lamplike way resembles all the other pieces, though installed alone in a large, darkened gallery under spotlights. Its shininess somehow evokes an ambience of decadence, leaving the viewer to contemplate the meaning of every little element, every symbolic reference, and the elusiveness of assemblage sculpture.

Who knows where she finds the time, but if she can make room in her busy schedule to create a new piece and help design its set, sound and video (with Carmine Covelli), as well as perform in it, you should make time in yours to see it. With the irresistible band of colleagues she has gathered (Natalie Agee, Mr. Medlyn, David Neumann and Mr. Covelli), Ms. Truscott will apparently be investigating a stormier world than she does in her burlesque performances. Each night promises to unfold a bit differently, as the performers explore a landscape of lost objects in which the ordinary and trivial take on new, and strange, import. No doubt it will be messy, absurd and fully alive. (Thursday through March 24 at 8 p.m., with additional 4 p.m. shows on March 24 and 25, Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, 212-477-5288, ps122.org; $20.)

2007-03-16T00:00:00Z,"The Justice Department filed a civil rights lawsuit yesterday against the State Department of Correctional Services, which runs the state's prisons. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, claims that the department discriminates ''by failing or refusing to reasonably accommodate'' Muslim employees who cannot comply with the department's uniform or grooming rules because of their religion. Last year, a Muslim guard, Abdus Samad N. Haqq, at a work release institution on West 110th Street, filed a lawsuit seeking an order permitting him to wear his kufi, a cap Muslims wear to signal devotion. His case is pending. A spokesman for the state attorney general's office did not respond to a request for comment. WILLIAM GLABERSON"
2007-03-16T00:00:00Z,"Longstanding restrictions that bar the reporting of federal election results from eastern districts while polls are still open in western time zones are constitutional, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-to-4 decision. Rejecting an argument that the prohibition violated free speech, the court said the temporary nature of the ban made it permissible. It upheld the conviction of Paul Bryan, a software developer in British Columbia, who posted vote tallies from Atlantic Canada in the 2000 election on a Web site while polls in his far western province were still open. He was fined $1,000 by a lower court. The rules were introduced in 1938 to cover radio broadcasts in the belief that voters in western time zones (there are five time zones across Canada) might be influenced or even discouraged from voting by results from the eastern zones.

The article mentions a number of Jerusalem neighborhoods as ''areas where roughly half of last year's home sales were to foreigners.''

2007-03-16T00:00:00Z,"The only dolphins around New York can be found in the water, typically in the aquarium on Coney Island. But these days at least one member of the species occupies a far more unusual position: up a tree in Chelsea. And this dolphin, the title character in the latest show from Atlantic for Kids, the children's wing of the Atlantic Theater Company, has far more to worry about than being beached in some branches. The dolphin is actually Tina, a little girl with a fondness for magic. When she casts a spell to bring her stuffed animals to life, she accidentally turns herself into a live version of her plush dolphin, which her pesky little brother has tossed into a tree. How Tina gets out of the woods -- literally and metaphorically -- is the subject of ''A Dolphin Up a Tree!,'' above, a cheery 45-minute musical by Kimberly Foster (book and lyrics) and John Fleming (music and lyrics). The other animals -- an intellectual owl (Charley Layton), a spontaneous but rather spacey fox (Katie Flahive) and an industrious beaver (Brad Mielke) -- try to help Tina (Lauren Hines), but fail to think outside the (toy) box. They never even call the Fire Department, but they do call on the audience for everything from a shoe to salt. The show, which has played in New York off and on since 2000, seems to have gained in whimsy and energy in this new production, directed by Paul Urcioli. And the actors deserve special kudos for bringing it off on the dour Edwardian set of ''The Voysey Inheritance,'' the Atlantic's current grown-up production. Parents will be particularly amused by Tina's references to the set's ornate portraits and by the animals' bursting into a song by Queen (''We Are the Champions'') after they finally solve Tina's problem. While there's nothing sophisticated about the musical's message -- work as a team and respect others' differences -- 3- to 8-year-olds won't mind. They may even be moved to contribute piggy-bank money to give Tina a much-needed scholarship to Hogwarts. (Tomorrow and Sunday at 10:30 a.m., the Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, 646-216-1190; $15; $5 for under 12 and members. Through March 25.) LAUREL GRAEBER"

2007-03-16T00:00:00Z,"For the first 20 minutes against Penn, Texas A&M looked as good as advertised. They played smothering defense. Their senior star, Acie Law IV, was in command, whether threading nifty passes into the lane or launching effortless jumpers from the perimeter. The Aggies, the No. 3 seed in the South Region, are something of a ''now'' team because of their hard-nosed style and recent emergence on the N.C.A.A. tournament stage. They were supposed to run away from 14th-seeded Penn and into a much-anticipated second-round matchup with Louisville. Eventually, they did, 68-52, but not before demonstrating that a perennial football power has some things to learn about single-elimination tournaments."

So No. 10 seed Texas Tech might have seemed the smart pick to knock off No. 7 Boston College on Thursday in their East Region first-round game at Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum. And for a stretch, the Red Raiders looked as if they could pull it off."
2007-03-16T00:00:00Z,"'' 'Til Death,'' Fox's struggling sitcom with Brad Garrett (''Everybody Loves Raymond''), showed signs of life on Wednesday in its new time slot after ''American Idol.''

By comparison, however, 25.6 million viewers tuned in at 9 to watch the first of 12 ''American Idol'' finalists be eliminated. That unlucky contestant was Brandon Rogers, above, a 28-year-old former backup singer. Mr. Rogers drew the fewest votes in a tally of 28 million calls and text messages after he forgot the words to the Supremes' song ''You Can't Hurry Love'' on Tuesday as Diana Ross watched from the front row.

At the time, many were surprised that the bidders believed the airline was worth so much, but with recently growing passenger loads and stable fuel prices, that view has changed. ''The underlying conditions in the airline market have improved and have made the original bid look a bit skinny,'' said Matthew Crowe, the transportation analyst at JPMorgan in Sydney. TIM JOHNSTON"
2007-03-16T00:00:00Z,"A member of the council that oversees investments by New Jersey's pension funds said yesterday that the state has been vastly underestimating how much money it should have to pay for retirement benefits that have been promised to employees. The council member, Douglas A. Love, said a more realistic calculation would show a $56 billion deficit -- more than three times as much as the $18 billion included in the state's most recent bond-offering statement. Public employees' unions and others have long accused New Jersey of mismanaging its pension funds. But Mr. Love has pointed to the use of what he said were inappropriate methods to calculate the value of the benefits promised. ''There is no financial enterprise in the world that is allowed to value its liabilities'' the way New Jersey, and other public pension funds, measure the value of theirs, Mr. Love said.

She had been under treatment for pneumonia for the past five days, apparently improving, but suffered a sudden reversal and passed away peacefully early Sunday morning. Barbara was born and grew up in Athens, Vermont, the daughter of Guy W. Powers and Ethyl Goewy Powers. The Powers family were Athens folk since before the American Revolution. She went to the one room school hose in Athens, then to Leland and Gray, and then on to Brattleboro High School. After graduation from the University of Vermont she went on to earn her MSW from the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work, and later a doctorate in psychotherapy from Union Graduate School. In 1962, she joined the Riverdale Mental Health Association as a psychiatric social worker, and served as the agency's executive director from 1964 to 1971. Later Dr. Kinoy became a noted authority on the treatment of eating disorders, serving as director of Professional Development at the Wilkins Center for Eating Disorders in Greenwich, Connecticut. She was also the coauthor of ''When Will We Laugh Again: Living and Dealing with Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia'', and the editor of ''New Directions in Treating and Recovery'', two highly regarded books in the field published by Columbia University Press.

Their age is about all they have in common. Mr. Del Tredici, especially, is from a different world than the other two, who are so-called minimalists. A reformed serialist who pioneered neo-Romanticism in the 1980s and won a Pulitzer Prize for his trouble, he is a colorful figure in and out of his music, writing lush and eclectic pieces, many based on Lewis Carroll (like ''In Memory of a Summer Day,'' which won the Pulitzer for music in 1980), and, more recently, celebrating sexuality in song cycles like ''Gay Life'' and ''My Favorite Penis Poems.'' Don't jump to the wrong conclusion: Mr. Del Tredici, above, plays up the sex, but he is actually more appealingly mischievous than shocking, and he usually makes you want to follow him on his distinctive and quirky journeys. The concerts honoring his birthday promise to be appropriately offbeat and varied, beginning tomorrow and continuing through the summer at various sites around New York. Tomorrow's celebration (the day after his birthday, but who's counting?) shows three different sides of his recent work: ''Three Gymnopedies'' for solo piano, a nod both to Erik Satie and to Mr. Del Tredici's younger piano-playing self; ''Chana's Story,'' a song cycle; and ''Dracula,'' a gothic monodrama for soprano and chamber ensemble told from the point of view of the count's female neighbor. Linking ''Dracula'' to classic horror films is the theremin, an electronic instrument that makes a sound like rubbed crystal, is played by movements of the hands in space and is often featured in the scores of those movies.

2007-03-16T00:00:00Z,"Discriminating moviegoers can be happy that Canadian film marches to a slower, more somber drumbeat than the electronic rat-a-tat-tat of Hollywood. The eight movies shown in Canadian Front 2007, the Museum of Modern Art's fourth annual survey of recent Canadian films, are as moody as the climate north of the border. It's unlikely that any American movie star making a directorial debut would choose a woman suffering from Alzheimer's as the subject of a first feature film. But that is the theme of ''Away From Her,'' the Canadian actress Sarah Polley's adaptation of Alice Munro's story ''The Bear Came Over the Mountain.'' The biggest shock in the movie, which Ms. Polley wrote as well as directed, is to discover Julie Christie, radiant at 65 (above with Gordon Pinsent), playing a woman who voluntarily hospitalizes herself after suffering an alarming memory lapse. When her husband of 44 years ( Mr. Pinsent) goes to visit her after an enforced 30-day moratorium on communication, he finds that she barely remembers him. Steeped in sorrow, the movie is a meticulous, beautifully acted exploration of loss of identity, the desperate struggle to communicate over the barrier of Alzheimer's and the fears and doubts raised by the loss of communication. Also of special note is ''Radiant City,'' Gary Burns and Jim Brown's quasi-documentary study of contemporary suburbia, whose environment is described by one expert as ''brutal, depressing and spiritually degrading.'' This film with a satirical edge interweaves portraits of two families who are neighbors in the same sterile development with scenes of a local production of a show called ''Suburb: The Musical.'' The film brings the angst of Richard Yates's novel ''Revolutionary Road'' into the 21st century. (Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 212-708-9400, moma.org; $10.) STEPHEN HOLDEN"

However, in the case of myself and my wife, Pari, we trump the current wedding planners in two ways. We were married on 7/7/77, and unlike the subjects of the article we had no idea of the actual date until after we were married. If the question is whether to know or not know of the lucky date in advance, I should note that as of this July we will have celebrated 30 years of wedded bliss, and for that I consider myself very lucky indeed.

2007-03-16T00:00:00Z,"There was not a safe spot on the floor for Albany's Jamar Wilson. His first shot was a wild fling at the hoop on a reverse layup after three Virginia players ran at him. His next shot had no chance, nor did his third shot, a 6-footer through a maze of hands in his face. Meanwhile, there was not a spot on the floor where Virginia's J.R. Reynolds could not make a shot. He hit arching three-pointers, runners off the backboard from the wing, and fadeaways from the baseline."
2007-03-16T00:00:00Z,"In Ken Loach's movies -- he has made more than 20 in the last 40 years -- characters frequently argue about politics, which is only fitting, since the films themselves are political arguments. There is no point in combing through Mr. Loach's work for hints of ideological significance. Ideology -- Marxist, anti-imperialist, aligned with the perceived interests of the powerless and the marginal -- is the engine that drives his stories. The clarity and force of those stories is considerable, but their bluntness sometimes sticks in the craw of critics, who often scold Mr. Loach for lacking subtlety. But in watching ''The Wind That Shakes the Barley,'' his new film (which won the top prize at Cannes last year), it is possible to appreciate both Mr. Loach's passion and his sense of nuance. Set in Ireland in the 1920s, the film paints history in stark colors and observes as they blur and bleed. Mr. Loach and Paul Laverty, the gifted screenwriter with whom he regularly collaborates, leave no doubt as to who the villains are in this tale."

Richard, in his voice-over narration, is the first to admit that his situation is enviable in many ways: He has a lovely wife named Brenda (Gina Torres), two cute small children, a spiffy house in the suburbs and a flourishing career at a reputable Manhattan firm. The problem, as you may be able to intuit from this checklist of bourgeois amenities, is that he's bored. He has reached a point at which existence settles into a series of pleasant routines and minor frustrations. In Richard's case one of these frustrations -- the sexual cooling of his marriage -- becomes the source of some potentially major trouble."

The ratings system is operated by the Classification and Ratings Administration, which is overseen by the National Association of Theater Owners and the Motion Picture Association of America. Footnotes Angelina Jolie left an orphanage in southern Vietnam yesterday with a 3-year-old boy whom Vietnamese officials have said she plans to adopt, The Associated Press reported. Ms. Jolie, who arrived in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday night, took the boy from the Tam Binh orphanage to the Department of Justice in Ho Chi Minh City, where adoption officials had said an official ceremony would take place. Ms. Jolie had arrived at the orphanage carrying her 5-year-old son, Maddox, whom she adopted in neighboring Cambodia in 2002. No Pogues tour is complete without a little misadventure. The band, the symbol of passionate, rambunctious Celtic rock for more than 20 years, is on a brief American tour with its original singer, Shane MacGowan, and it has already had to scrap one show. After Mr. MacGowan had ''an accidental tumble on a piece of stage equipment'' onstage in Boston on Sunday night, the band said in a statement, it canceled its performance at Roseland in Manhattan on Wednesday night only hours before show time, as fans trickled toward the club, on West 52nd Street. The band is scheduled to perform tonight in Philadelphia and at Roseland tomorrow."

2007-03-16T00:00:00Z,"Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about a white Missouri man and a black Harlem woman who found out through genetic testing that they were related referred imprecisely to the given name of a performer who entertained during a New York family reunion. She goes by Cissy Houston, not Emily. (She was born Emily Drinkard.)"

Vanessa Redgrave stars in this adaptation of Joan Didion's heartbreaking memoir. David Hare directs (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway 'THE ATTIC' The playwright Yoji Sakate looks at hikikomori, the Japanese phenomenon in which teenagers retreat from society, isolating themselves for weeks, months and sometimes even years. With a deft ensemble cast, the results are illuminating, original and darkly funny. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combatting addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Bellafante) 'BLINDNESS' Joe Tantalo's adaptation of José Saramago's best-selling novel, about an unnamed city struck with an inexplicable epidemic of ''white blindness,'' is set in a cell-like space surrounded by white scrim. This setting and the mostly strong acting drive home the fearful basic circumstances. Unfortunately, the script also streamlines Mr. Saramago's reflective story to the point of draining it of moral complexity (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jonathan Kalb) 'THE CAVE DWELLERS' This revival of William Saroyan's 1957 play about a group of misfits inhabiting an abandoned theater examines the virtue of charity and the nobility of failure but feels as stifling and constricted as the building in which the outcasts find themselves. A production that asks us to revere the theater without inviting reverence itself (1:30). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) 'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE DIRECTOR' A likable if naïve young woman, who is seduced by an unnamed, unseen and presumably unscrupulous film director, seeks other of his victims and tape records their experiences for no clear purpose in a play that has no clear idea of what it wants to say (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet, transfixing production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic. (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) * 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Isherwood) 'KING LEAR' Or ''Lear Lite,'' featuring New Age music; eye-soothing, color-coordinated costumes; and the charming Kevin Kline in the title role. Directed by James Lapine, this is a whimsical story-book production that feels perversely out of touch with the soul-wrenching depths of Shakespeare's most devastating tragedy (3:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley) 'LOS ANGELES' Julian Sheppard's play about a gamin lost in a Hollywood of aimlessness and empty sex is as thin as the slip dress she keeps wearing and, presumably, taking off (1:20). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante) 'MARY ROSE' J. M. Barrie wrote this distaff variation on themes from ''Peter Pan'' in 1920, and it has mostly lain on the shelf since. A young English girl (an exuberant Paige Howard) acquires the odd habit of disappearing and reappearing some time later, untouched by time's passing. Gentle and melancholy, handsomely mounted by Tina Landau, ''Mary Rose'' is nonetheless itself touched by the mark of time (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'MY TRIP TO AL-QAEDA' Lawrence Wright, author of a deeply researched book about the rise of Islamic terrorism, conducts a theatrical seminar about the events leading to the horror of 9/11. He combines a linear narrative of the development of Al Qaeda with reminiscences about the experience of writing the book. Absorbing, and chilling too (1:30). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 'BAAL' The director Charmian Creagle's bright idea for staging Bertolt Brecht's often offensive first play -- about a poet and singer who is a monster of appetite -- was to cast the title role as a woman. The production is so poorly acted and drearily directed, however, that the casting does nothing to illuminate the play or open a meaningful inquiry into habitual reactions to it (2:15). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 307-9467. (Kalb) 'MOBY DICK -- REHEARSED' A gripping revival of Orson Welles's 1955 adaptation of Melville's classic (2:00). Richmond Shepard Theater, 309 East 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'PARTICULARLY IN THE HEARTLAND' You can almost feel the self-congratulation in the hearts and minds of the writers and performers of this surrealist ensemble piece as they try to understand how the Red states think and live. The result? A well-intentioned mess of emoting over the current political divides (1:30). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101). (Bellafante) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100.

Robert Cucuzza's period piece about swindlers, liars and prostitutes is surprisingly sedate (1:30). Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, www.acmeactinglab.com; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'REPUBLIC OF DREAMS' A homage to Bruno Schulz that consists of a pastiche of scenes suggested by excerpts from that profoundly surreal Polish writer's work. Parts are intriguing, but there is little coherence in the jumble of scenes to help an audience unfamiliar with the author (1:00). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (Hampton) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban) '1001 BEDS' Tim Miller's latest confessional monologue is a sweetly nostalgic walk down memory lane (1:30). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'THE ABANDONED' (R, 95 minutes) The title of this dull, hysterical horror movie seems to refer to its release strategy. The greatest mystery is why it showed up in theaters at all, rather than going straight to DVD. (A. O. Scott) 'AMAZING GRACE' (PG, 120 minutes) Michael Apted's prettified take on the life and times of the 18th-century reformer William Wilberforce carries a strong whiff of piety but is generally pleasing and often moving, and features fine performances from newcomers and veterans alike. (Manohla Dargis) 'THE ASTRONAUT FARMER' (PG, 102 minutes) This sentimental fable about a Texas rancher who follows his dreams and builds a rocket ship in his barn is made bearable -- just -- by Billy Bob Thornton's underplayed performance in the lead role, and also by the wide-eyed visual wonderment of the director, Michael Polish, who is the co-writer of the picture with his twin brother, Mark. (Scott) 'BLACK SNAKE MOAN' (R, 116 minutes) Christina Ricci as a Tennessee nymphomaniac and Samuel Jackson as the blues singer who tries to cure her by fastening her half-naked self to his radiator with a chain. In spite of that summary, it's mostly corny uplift, from Craig Brewer, who also wrote and directed the down-home pimp fairy tale ''Hustle & Flow.'' (Scott) 'BREACH' (PG-13, 110 minutes) In his fine, no-nonsense account of the capture of the F.B.I. agent-turned-mole Robert Philip Hanssen, the director Billy Ray manages to excite and unnerve despite our knowing the ending. Chris Cooper and Ryan Phillippe star. (Dargis) * 'BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA' (PG, 95 minutes) Grounded more in reality than in fantasy, this adaptation of Katherine Paterson's novel offers an affecting story of a transformative friendship between two gifted children. Beautifully capturing a time when a bully in school can loom as large as a troll in a nightmare, the director, Gabor Csupo, keeps the fantasy in the background to find magic in the everyday. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'A JOURNEY OF DMITRY SHOSTAKOVICH' (No rating, 75 minutes) A documentary grab bag of film clips, diary readings and desultory narration, ''A Journey of Dmitry Shostakovich'' peeks at the politics of this controversial composer through a flurry of archival curiosities. But in their struggle to portray a man compromising his art to save his life, the directors, Oksana Dvornichenko and Helga Landauer, adopt a scattershot approach that's ultimately as ambiguous and impenetrable as its subject. (Catsoulis) * 'THE CATS OF MIRIKITANI' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Japanese) Linda Hattendorf's remarkable documentary follows her growing friendship with a homeless artist from her New York City neighborhood. Born in Sacramento in 1920 and raised in Hiroshima, Jimmy Tsutomu Mirikitani relives his painful past with vivid paintings of internment camps and blood-red cities. When his health is threatened by the dust clouds of Sept. 11, Ms. Hattendorf moves him into her home, and what began as an interesting portrait of an outsider artist becomes a fascinating story of injustice and endurance. (Catsoulis) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyoncé Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) 'EXTERMINATING ANGELS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in French) The French director Jean-Claude Brisseau's film is a piece of highbrow smut about a French filmmaker directing a piece of highbrow smut. A must for fans of highbrow smut. No complaints here. (Scott) 'GHOST RIDER' (PG-13, 114 minutes) After a long string of financial flops, Nicolas Cage returns to play Johnny Blaze, a stunt motorcycle rider whose soul belongs to the Devil. Despite the promise of the first 30 minutes -- when Johnny is played by the charming young actor Matt Long -- a witless script and a central character who's more funny than frightening suggest that the filmmakers' franchise hopes may be dashed. (Catsoulis) 'HANNIBAL RISING' (R, 121 minutes) This primer on Hannibal Lecter reduces a mythic villain to a callow, dysfunctional chef. Orphaned in World War II, our psychopathic hero hunts down his family's killers and snacks on their remains. But burrowing into the id of pop culture's most repulsive gourmet demands a sanguinary glee that the director, Peter Webber, may not possess; for all the movie's spurting gore, there's no rush of blood to the head. (Catsoulis) * 'THE HOST' (R, 119 minutes, in Korean) A loopy, feverishly imaginative genre hybrid -- part carnival of horrors, part family melodrama -- about the demons that haunt us from without and within. The talented South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho directs his monster and humans with equal flair. (Dargis) * 'INTO GREAT SILENCE' (No rating, 162 minutes, in English and Latin) Philip Gröning's documentary about the lives of Carthusian monks living in a valley in the French Alps is slow, quiet and utterly spellbinding for the way it conveys the experience of spiritual devotion in simple, lovely images. (Scott) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'THE LIVES OF OTHERS' (R, 137 minutes, in German) Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut feature takes place in East Berlin in 1984, and it is a smart, moving inquiry into the moral predicament facing good people in a bad system. Ulrich Mühe's performance as a conscience-stricken Stasi officer is a tightly wound tour de force, and Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are both superb as a playwright and his actress lover who are drawn into the cruel, absurd clutches of the Communist secret police. (Scott) 'MAXED OUT' (No rating, 87 minutes) A scattershot exposé of usurious banking practices in debt-ridden America, ''Maxed Out'' examines why the most vulnerable segment of society is victimized by the lending industry and finds a simple answer: it's obscenely profitable. (Stephen Holden) 'MUSIC AND LYRICS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant phone in passable impersonations of themselves in this competent romantic comedy, which is somewhat enlivened by parodies of bad pop songs from both the 1980s and the present. (Scott) 'THE NAMESAKE' (PG-13, 122 minutes) Color is the stuff of life in the movies of Mira Nair, the Indian-born director whose newest film, adapted from Jhumpa Lahiri's popular novel, follows two generations of a Bengali family from late-1970s Calcutta to New York City. Her lush palette lends her films a throbbing physicality that invites you to step into the screen and embrace the sensuous here and now. (Holden) 'THE NUMBER 23' (R, 95 minutes) An accidental comedy starring a deadly serious Jim Carrey that owes something to David Fincher, a little something else to Robert Anton Wilson and next to nothing, at least intentionally, to the gods of laughter, be they Gelus (Greek) or Jerry Lewis (American). (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) 'RENO 911!: MIAMI' (R, 81 minutes) The title more or less says all you need to know about the story, the action and the point. (Dargis) 'ROCK BOTTOM' (No rating, 75 minutes) This graphic documentary by Jay Corcoran is a strong, scary examination of the crystal methedrine epidemic among gay men in New York. (Holden) 'STARTER FOR TEN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) This amiable, nostalgic British comedy tackles a lofty subject -- the allure of knowledge --with down-to-earth charm, following a working-class kid (James McAvoy) during his first year at Bristol University and an appearance on the TV quiz show ''University Challenge.'' But beneath the formulaic embarrassments and fumbled learning curve lurks a more somber theme: the inevitable rupture between those who pursue an education and those left behind. (Catsoulis) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) 'THE ULTIMATE GIFT' (PG, 114 minutes) This hairball of good-for-you filmmaking coughed up by 20th Century Fox's new religion-oriented label, Fox Faith, follows a trust fund baby (Drew Fuller) as he learns to be a better, poorer person. And while it's always fun when Hollywood aims to instruct us in the spiritual pitfalls of filthy lucre, perhaps insulting the artistic sensibilities of Christian audiences isn't the best way to get them into the multiplex. (Catsoulis) 'WILD HOGS' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Tame slop. (Scott) * 'ZODIAC' (R, 158 minutes) David Fincher's magnificently obsessive new film tracks the story of the serial killer who left dead bodies up and down California in the 1960s and possibly the '70s, and that of the men who tried to stop him. Set when the Age of Aquarius disappeared into the black hole of the Manson family murders, ''Zodiac'' is part police procedural, part monster movie, a funereal entertainment that is a testament to this cinematic savant's gifts. (Dargis) Film Series 'CENTERED IN THE STORM': WORKS BY MASTER FILMMAKER TIAN ZHUANGZHUANG (Today through Tuesday) The main attraction of this mini-retrospective of one of China's most eclectic and interesting filmmakers is ''The Go Master,'' Mr. Tian's most recent film and the story of a young Chinese man who rises through the ranks of Japan's championship Go players while World War II rages offscreen. Also screening: ''The Blue Kite,'' a 1993 feature about a family torn apart by the excesses of Maoism (it earned Mr. Tian a five-year ban from feature filmmaking), and the serenely classical ''Springtime in a Small Town'' (2002), this director's illuminating remake of a 1948 Chinese feature by Fei Mu. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) 'PIMPS, PROSTITUTES AND PIGS': SHOHEI IMAMURA'S JAPAN (Today through Thursday) The great earthy cynic of Japanese film, Shohei Imamura, died last year, leaving a staggering volume of work. This monthlong festival includes several of his more rarely screened films, including (tonight) ''Profound Desire of the Gods'' (1968), a raucous social panorama set on a small island where technology is destroying the old way of life; ''The Pornographers'' (1966), an unlikely comedy about a man who makes pornographic movies in the hope of improving the Japanese character; and ''Intentions of Murder'' (1964)), in which a woman defies convention and takes matters into her own hands after she is raped. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Kehr) 'LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION': ARTISTS' FILMS FOR THE CINEMA (Tomorrow) The Whitney Museum of American Art's series of films by artists best known for their work in other mediums continues with a program enigmatically called ''Hype My Light.'' Tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. Joseph Cornell's collage film ''Rose Hobart'' (1936), about that all but forgotten actress, will be shown. This 19-minute reverie was carved out of a 16-millimeter print of the 1931 Universal sound feature ''East of Borneo'' (and not from ''a classic silent,'' as the Whitney catalog asserts). It shares a double bill with the self-mythologizing of ''Pull My Daisy'' (1959), Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie's celebration of their Beat Generation pals. At 2 p.m. Buster Keaton walks through Samuel Beckett's ''Film'' (1965) (which the Whitney, paradoxically, is screening on video). It will be followed by Rebecca Horn's 1991 feature, ''Buster's Bedroom,'' about a woman so obsessed with Keaton that she checks herself into the sanitarium where he dried out in the 1930s. Whitney Museum of American Art, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; $15. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * ALLMAN BROTHERS (Thursday) The best spring ritual on the Upper West Side is the arrival of this archetypal Southern rock band for its annual series of concerts at the Beacon Theater. This year there are 13 shows over three weeks, beginning on Thursday, and in addition to the long, long guitar solos by Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks, highlights usually include lots of guest stars. At 8 p.m., 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario) LAURIE ANDERSON (Tonight and Sunday night) Ms. Anderson's entrancing performances weave coolly surrealistic songs and reflective monologues with a witty, seamless dream logic. At 7, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) Diahann Carroll (Tonight and tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday nights) Her follow-up to last year's triumphant return to nightclub performance is essentially the same show she performed last year, but with a few tweaks. It's still excellent. At 8:30, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover, with a $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden) KARAN CASEY (Monday) A former member of the Irish band Solas, Ms. Casey sets her clear voice in arrangements that mix traditional and modern instruments, maintaining the taut, quivering ornamentation of old ballad style and singing tales of love, war and murder with a gentle gravity. At 7:30 p.m., Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 601-1000, makor.org; $20. (Jon Pareles) CHIEFTAINS (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Chieftains spearheaded a revival of Irish traditional music, playing only the oldest instruments: fiddle, harp, wooden flute, uilleann pipes, bodhran, tin whistle. Then they decided that Irish tradition wasn't enough and started to look further afield: to Spain, to China, to rock. But they have been returning to their Irish core, and there's a great ensemble behind the shtick. Tonight at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $22 to $68. Tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $85. (Pareles) DAUGHTRY (Monday) Like Jennifer Hudson, Chris Daughtry -- who drops his first name when performing with a band -- is a sign of why ''American Idol'' doesn't work perfectly: he reached only as high as No. 4 last season, but his album, ''Daughtry'' (RCA), with arena-size, fist-pumping rock songs, has become one of the biggest and steadiest sellers of the year. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario) DECEMBERISTS (Wednesday and Thursday) He might not exactly have a lot of competition, but Colin Meloy, the songwriter and strategist of this band from Portland, Ore., can set old Irish epics and alliterative fables about Dickensian chimney sweeps to progressive folk-rock like nobody else. Opening the show is My Brightest Diamond, led by Shara Worden, who in a slippery and dexterous voice spins fantasies that leap in scale from music boxes to heavenly bodies. At 8 p.m., Landmark Loew's Jersey Theater, 54 Journal Square, Jersey City, (866) 468-7619, loewsjersey.org; $27.50 to $30. (Sisario) THE DOUBLE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Something is always intriguingly askew in the songs of this local band: jagged guitars, David Greenhill's neurotic sing-speak vocals, the asymmetric gurglings of its Vox Continental organ. But the oblique lines come together in unexpected and sometimes hauntingly beautiful ways. With Mike Wexler tonight, and the Japanese Beetles and Crystal Stilts tomorrow. At 8, Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $8. (Sisario) EXPLOSIONS IN THE SKY (Tuesday) The epic instrumentals by this band from Austin, Tex., begin in peace, with single notes twinkling amid darkness, and gradually build to turbulent vortexes of noise. Borrowing a few tricks from Pink Floyd, Explosions in the Sky keeps the pace majestic and the vistas cinematic, and takes its time. With the Paper Chase and Eluvium. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) RUTHIE FOSTER (Wednesday and Thursday) A veteran of the acoustic folk circuit, this Texas singer and guitarist has turned to the sound of cozy 1960s soul on her new album, ''The Phenomenal Ruthie Foster'' (Blue Corn Music). That suits her friendly alto fine, but her power and sass come through better in bare, bluesy songs, like her version of Son House's boiling ''Grinnin' in Your Face.'' Wednesday at 8 p.m., with Amy Helm of Ollabelle, at the Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. Thursday at 10 p.m., with Lucy Wainwright Roche, at Pete's Candy Store, 709 Lorimer Street, between Frost and Richardson Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-3770, petescandystore.com; free. (Sisario) Fujiya & Miyagi (Sunday through Tuesday) This British trio, which derives part of its name from ''The Karate Kid'' -- ''We are only pretending to be Japanese,'' goes one lyric -- plays bubbly, perpetual-motion figures of guitar and keyboard, and never breaks a sweat. Its sound has been heard plenty of times before, from '90s groups like Stereolab and from earlier German experimentalists, but it's too fun and innocuous to ever tire of. Sunday at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. Monday at 9 p.m., McIntosh Student Center, Barnard College, Broadway at 117th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-6538, wbar.org; $5. (Sisario) * GILBERTO GIL (Tuesday) This pillar of Brazilian music, a creator of the postmodern Tropicália style in the '60s and now his country's minister of culture, makes a rare appearance at Carnegie Hall. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $72. (Sisario) * LEVON HELM (Tonight and tomorrow night) After a hiatus for recovery from throat cancer, Mr. Helm, the former drummer of the Band and the singer of hits like ''The Weight,'' has returned with a raspier but still powerfully expressive voice. These shows have an unusual setting: the Beacon Theater. Lately Mr. Helm has preferred to play for small groups at his home studio in Woodstock, N.Y. At 8 p.m., 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) INDIGO GIRLS (Tuesday and Wednesday) Guitar strumming, close harmonies, coffeehouse earnestness and songs about the perpetual struggle for love, self-affirmation and a clear conscience have made the duo of Emily Saliers and Amy Ray perennials for the collegiate at heart. With Kaki King. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $40. (Pareles) KODO (Tonight and tomorrow night) This Japanese drum troupe doesn't need microphones for some of its music: taiko ritual pieces made to be heard for miles, pounded on drums as large as the people who play them. From that foundation, the group has also fused its music with rhythms from India, Brazil and elsewhere. Tonight, as part of its 25th-anniversary tour, Kodo members play a rare small-scale show at Joe's Pub with Kaoru Watanabe, a former member now based in New York. At 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $35; $60 for both shows. Tomorrow night at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $20 to $58. (Pareles) * LAMB OF GOD (Thursday) Lamb of God, from Richmond, Va., derives some of its grinding, jackhammer-fast churn from Slayer and Pantera, and without any irony or sarcasm calls its style ''pure American metal.'' With Trivium, Machine Gun and Gojira. At 6:45 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $26 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) SUSAN McKEOWN (Today) A regular on the Irish music scene of New York, Ms. McKeown, who was born in Dublin, performs traditional music and contemporary songs about the immigrant experience in a strong, forthright voice. At 12:30 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. (Sisario) MEW (Thursday) This Danish band straddles the arty and sentimental extremes of Radiohead, indulging in dense guitar textures but leaving room for crying, emotive vocals. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $18.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) Jane Monheit (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday nights) The beauty of her sultry voice performing bossa nova ballads triumphs over liabilities that include obvious shyness and rushed, perfunctory patter. At 8:45, with additional shows at 10:45 tonight, tomorrow and Thursday, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 cover at tables, $55 at the bar. (Holden) * WILLIE NELSON, MERLE HAGGARD AND RAY PRICE (Thursday) On their new album, ''The Last of the Breed'' (Lost Highway), these mellow titans of country music lean back and savor every sweet note of classic songs by Hank Williams, Kris Kristofferson and others, recreating with pedal steel guitars and harmonies by the Jordanaires the sound of a Nashville recording studio, about 1960. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $46.50 to $81.50. (Sisario) * OOIOO (Tuesday) O.K., maybe this offshoot of the Japanese band the Boredoms is not quite as cartoonishly antic as that group, which for nearly two decades has been one of the planet's most unpredictable musical forces. But the tribal drums, electronic squeaks and jazz-fusion guitar and trumpet on OOIOO's new album, ''Taiga'' (Thrill Jockey), come pretty close. Also on the bill is I.U.D., featuring Lizzie Bougatsos of the experimental New York band Gang Gang Dance. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) * POGUES (Tomorrow) The band that made traditional Irish music seem like punk rock -- and vice versa -- plays the last of three shows for what Guinness calls the ''St. Patrick's Day season.'' Last year the Pogues played their first shows in New York in 15 years with Shane MacGowan, their Dionysian former singer, and Mr. MacGowan is back on board again. With the Tossers. At 8 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) RODRIGO Y GABRIELA (Wednesday) Once thrash-metal bandmates in Mexico, this guitar duo discovered what the Gipsy Kings have long known: Europeans and Americans go crazy for virtuosic acoustic renditions of their favorite '70s rock ballads. The Gipsy Kings did it with ''Hotel California,'' and Rodrigo y Gabriela's repertory includes a lush ''Stairway to Heaven.'' With Krystle Warren. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario) RALPH STANLEY (Sunday) Mr. Stanley's stark, unflinching ''O Death'' leaped out of the soundtrack of ''O Brother, Where Are Thou?'' and introduced a few million new listeners to a gripping, venerable singer whose songs about sin, temptation and salvation are cornerstones of country music. Leading his own band, Mr. Stanley is more avuncular than apocalyptic, but his songs still have eerie moments. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $30 in advance, $33 at the door. (Pareles) Suishou no Fune (Tuesday) This Tokyo group, whose name means crystal ship, carries on a Japanese underground rocktradition of immersion in both tranquil, spooky psychedelia and rumbling sonic chaos. Like Fushitsusha, its earliest ancestor, Suishou no Fune is transcendent in either extreme. At 8 p.m., with Madeline and Dynamite Arrows, Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. (Sisario) * JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, PINK (Wednesday) Like Michael Jackson or Prince, Justin Timberlake is the kind of pop star who makes it all look easy. But even more endearing, the guy can truly make fun of himself: his brilliant ''Saturday Night Live'' skit with Andy Samberg, bleeped on television but uncensored on the Internet, was the equivalent of a chummy high-five with his audience. Opening the show is Pink, the spark plug who once bragged of getting the party started and now ridicules ''stupid girls'' who torture themselves for men. At 7:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $53 to $151. (Sisario) YOUNG KNIVES (Tuesday and Thursday) The Young Knives, from the tiny English town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, are not the first to pick up Gang of Four's legacy of jagged guitars, uptight punk-funk and lyrics about the angry boredom of the workaday life, but on ''Voices of Animals and Men'' (Transgressive/Ryko), the band does it with worthy verve and wit. Tuesday at 9:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. Thursday at 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. BARBARIAN HORDE (Tonight) The tenor saxophonist Tony Barba leads this deliriously kinetic improv-funk band, which celebrates the release of an album called ''Your Pleasure Is Our Business'' (Barbariansmusic). At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762, tealoungeny.com; donation, $5. (Nate Chinen) STANLEY CLARKE (Tuesday through Thursday) On electric or acoustic bass, Mr. Clarke is a fleet-fingered marvel with a particular gift for funk and soul. He works with the drummer Lenny White, his former rhythm section partner in the fusion flagship Return to Forever, and the pianist and singer Patrice Rushen, with whom he has recorded several albums, including last year's ''Standards'' (Kind of Blue). (Through March 25.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) ANAT COHEN QUARTET (Tomorrow) The clarinetist and saxophonist Anat Cohen previews material from a pair of forthcoming releases, ''Poetica'' and ''Noir'' (Anzic), with a group consisting of Gilad Hekselman on guitar, Edward Perez on bass and Ferenc Nemeth on drums.

Opera 'DIE ÄEGYPTISCHE HELENA' (Monday) Not your everyday Richard Strauss opera has a new production at the Metropolitan Opera, and performances continue on Monday. Deborah Voigt stars in the title role, and Fabio Luisi conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 to $175. (Bernard Holland) 'ANDREA CHENIER' (Thursday) Set in the 18th century but very much a product of the 19th, Giordano's Italian drama of the French Revolution returns to the Met with a cast that is able to sing very, very loudly, if not always especially elegantly or with particular Italian flair: Violeta Urmana, Ben Heppner and Mark Delavan. Marco Armiliato, emerging as a solid presence in the pit, conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Anne Midgette) * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Bartlett Sher's breezy new production of Rossini's opera, which was introduced in November and returned on Wednesday night, conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality of the characters also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing of a handsome cast. The baritone Peter Mattei is a robust and agile Figaro. The tenor Juan Diego Flórez, sounding fresher than in the fall, could not be more adorable as the amorous Count Almaviva. The captivating mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato is a vocally agile and feisty Rosina. The virile bass-baritone John Relyea makes the wily Don Baisilio seem delightfully dangerous. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $120 tickets remaining for tomorrow, $15 to $65 for Wednesday. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'LA DONNA DEL LAGO' (Thursday) New York City Opera's last foray into the little-known world of Rossini's serious operas was successful enough that the company is going back for more, with the same two leads featured in ''Ermione'' a few seasons ago. Alexandrina Pendatchanska is an intense, committed soprano; Barry Banks, the tenor, is emerging as someone to watch. Chas Rader-Shieber, the director, has brought an antic touch to his two previous outings with the company, ''Flavio'' (which returns this spring) and ''Orlando.'' George Manahan conducts. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $120. (Midgette) 'FAUST' (Tomorrow) Gounod's lush score is back at the Met in Andrei Serban's staging, now less hyperactive than when it was introduced in 2005. Alas, someone appears to have gotten to its soul before Méphistophélès had the chance: the singers, though all fine, put the drama at arm's length, so the work's intense passions don't quite come through. In the cast: Ramón Vargas in the title role, Ruth Ann Swenson as Marguerite and Ildar Abdrazakov as Méphistophélès. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $120 to $220 remaining.

(Holland) 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' (Tonight through Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) At City Opera, Lillian Groag avoids the topical updating that has become a Gilbert and Sullivan tradition and focuses on the work's own satirical targets, which range from Victorian British society to the conventions of Italian grand opera. Even so, her direction is inventive and lively, as are the performances by a cast that includes Sarah Jane McMahon as Mabel, Matt Morgan as Frederic, Marc Kudisch as the Pirate King and Mark Jacoby as Major General Stanley. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 1:30, Tuesday and Wednesday night at 7:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $130. (Kozinn) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tonight and Tuesday) For its revival of Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production, the Met is rotating casts, with three sopranos sharing the role of Violetta. The earthy Bulgarian soprano Krassimira Stoyanova, who made her Met debut in 2001 and who was recently heard at the house as Nedda in ''Pagliacci,'' sings Violetta, the role of her debut. The compelling German tenor Jonas Kaufmann is Alfredo, Violetta's impulsive lover. And the veteran American baritone Dwayne Croft is Alfredo's tragically interfering father, Germont. Marco Armiliato conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $205. (Tommasini) Classical Music ALARM WILL SOUND (Sunday) This ensemble of young new-music specialists makes a point of ignoring genre barriers. Included in this retrospective are the group's own arrangements of electronica by Aphex Twin, as well as pieces by several of the ensemble's performers. In this context, John Adams (represented by ''Scratchband'') may seem the most conservative composer on the program, and how often does that happen? At 3 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 to $40. (Kozinn) DIANA DAMRAU (Wednesday) This fine German coloratura soprano, in town for the Met's new production of ''Die Äegyptische Helena,'' takes time out to make her New York recital debut with a program of French-language songs by Liszt and Barber, songs (sung in English) by Rachmaninoff, Berg's ''Seven Early Songs,'' Zemlinsky's ''Gesänge'' (Op. 6) and, of course, songs by Strauss.

(Midgette) * INGRID FLITER (Wednesday) The career of this Argentine pianist has taken off since winning the 2006 Gilmore Artist Award and its $300,000 prize. Ms. Fliter makes her New York recital debut with a program including Beethoven's C minor Variations (WoO 80); Schubert's Sonata in A (D. 959); and Chopin's Nocturne in D flat (Op. 27, No. 2), ''Barcarolle'' (Op. 60), Ballade in F minor (Op. 52) and Three Mazurkas (Op. 59). At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $35 to $40. (Vivien Schweitzer) ANDREA GRUBER and RUSSELL THOMAS (Sunday) The wood-paneled auditorium at the Morgan Library & Museum is a warm, resonant space, and it should resound aplenty with the voice of Andrea Gruber, the opera soprano, who will appear in recital with Russell Thomas, a young tenor, under the aegis of the George London Foundation, which pairs established singers with rising ones. The program should contain at least a whiff of opera: it includes music by Beethoven, Duparc, Ponchielli, Puccini and Verdi. Ken Noda is the accompanist. At 4 p.m., 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 877-6347, themorgan.org; $45.

(Dunning) * PEAK PERFORMANCES: VINCENT DANCE THEATER (Thursday) From Sheffield, England, Charlotte Vincent and her modern-dance troupe will make their American debut with ''Broken Chords'' in the Peak Performances avant-garde showcase at Montclair State University. Inspired by Ms. Vincent's divorce, this piece has been described as a portrait of grief, both searing and funny. (Through March 25.) Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, One Normal Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112; $25. (Dunning) * DESMOND RICHARDSON AND THE ALL STARS PROJECT (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Richardson and 15 performers from All Stars, a cultural program for teenagers from New York City and Newark, have created ''Homeland Security: Bringing Dr. King Up to Date,'' a multimedia piece that questions American notions of ''homeland'' and ''security.''

(Dunning) * Tamango's Urban Tap (Tuesday through Thursday) One of America's few great indigenous art forms, tap is the result of diverse cultures meeting -- and mixing.

(Through March 25.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $36.

Also, old favorites like ''Company B,'' set to World War II songs sung by the Andrews Sisters (tonight); the lush and serene ''Roses'' (tomorrow afternoon); the hushed ''Sunset,'' and ''Esplanade,'' a feat of athletic dancing that is unruly and calm by turn (Sunday). Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, citycenter.org; $15 to $125. (Dunning) URBAN BALLET THEATER (Tomorrow and Sunday) Ballet meets break-dancing in choreography by the company's director, Daniel Catanach, complete with a live D.J., on a program with pieces by Andres Gonzalez and Randy Luna.

(Dunning) * ANN LIV YOUNG (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Young's ''Snow White'' departs from the traditional to explore (what else?) the psychosexual tensions between Snow White, her Evil Stepmother (could they be an item?) and her Prince, which run rampant in claustrophobic interiors and kitschy woodlands. (Through March 24.) All performances at 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org; $12. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: MARTíN RAMíREZ, through April 29. Ramírez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters. But most of all, Ramírez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) * Asia Society: Glass, Gilding, and Grand Design: Art of Sasanian Iran (224-642 A.D.), through May 20. With some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, this is the first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Grace Glueck) Guggenheim Museum: 'Family Pictures,' through April 16. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents posing awkwardly against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children, has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Mother of Pearl: A Tradition in Asian Lacquer,' through April 1. Ornamentalism is the term for this show of some 40 objects so preposterously exquisite that they might have been conceived with a modern museum conservator's soft white cotton gloves in mind. The technique for creating mini-mosaics from slivers of mollusk shell is an ancient one that was perfected in China before traveling to Korea, Japan, Thailand and India. Examples from all those places are here in writing boxes and tea trays guaranteed to appeal to any window-shopper's acquisitive yearnings and magpie eye. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) * The METropOlitan museum of art: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer, and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Glueck) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * Moma: 'JEFF WALL,' through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies are enthralling visual vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (See above.) (Smith) * National Academy Museum: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975, through April 22. Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show's 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Gordon MaTTA-cLARK rETROSPECTIVE,' through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lorna Simpson,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea Michael Waugh: 'Lead me astray' Mr. Waugh's work is about close reading. Several large drawings of 19th-century landscapes are composed of handwritten phrases, cut and pasted in nonsensical order, from American presidential inaugural speeches. A drawing of the Spanish colonial explorer Cabeza de Vaca, who landed in Florida, is installed in a room plastered with promotional materials from a different colonialist enterprise, the last Art Basel/Miami fair. Schroeder Romero, 637 West 27th Street, (212) 630-0722; through March 24. (Cotter) Last Chance * Cathy Begien The reason to see this first solo show by the San Francisco filmmaker Cathy Begien is an ingenious, surprisingly intense short video called ''Black Out.'' In it the blindfolded artist delivers an episodic account of a bad-trip, club-hopping night on the town, as friends pop into the frame from the side to hand her drinks and cigarettes and act out parts of the story. When Ms. Begien breaks down toward the end of the film, it's hard to tell whether she's laughing or crying. Both responses make sense. Winkleman Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 643-3152; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * ALINE KOMINSKY CRUMB: 'NEED MORE LOVE' On the occasion of her wonderfully forthright, lavishly illustrated book of the same title, one of the premier cartoonists of her generation and a force in the development of the confessional graphic novel lets quite a bit of it all hang out in paintings, drawings and, best of all, comic strips dating from 1973 to the present. Adam Baumgold Gallery, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338; closes tomorrow. (Smith) EVA AND FRACO MATTES: '13 MOST BEAUTIFUL AVATARS' This artistic duo, best known for media hacking and culture jamming, has turned to digital canvas portraits of avatars -- digital surrogates -- from the online virtual world Second Life. With their flat colors, slightly blocky features and assertive hair, these images have a jaded artifice worthy of ''Blade Runner,'' but are also eerily effective as paintings. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-3323; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * BAKER OVERSTREET: NEW PAINTINGS Like Keegan McHargue and Devendra Banhart, this young artist has a penchant for tribal motifs, which he flattens into symmetrical compositions and renders with an outsider roughness. The works in his debut show evoke the imagery of the space-ship-obsessed, self-taught artist Ionel Talpazan, as well as Alfred Jensen and Forrest Bess. Their notion of the visionary is both self-conscious and familiar, but they are painted with energetic dispatch and a sure sense of scale, color and wit that encourage you to stay tuned. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 633-6555, fredericksfreisergallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG: TRANSFER DRAWINGS FROM THE 1960S This is the first exhibition devoted to the artist's large transfer drawings of the 1960s, which function less as works of art than as refined filtering systems. Their hazy, flickering surfaces mix bits of history (the space race, the civil rights movement, the cold war) with eruptions of weirdly rotelike graphic finesse -- the windshield-wiper strokes with which Rauschenberg brought his images to the surface. Extraordinarily beautiful and hauntingly multifarious, these works show us art, art history and the very times we live in taking shape. Jonathan O'Hara Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-3533; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics' Intense is the word for the stealth-potency of this first-time United States survey of original designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) * 'What F Word?' The ''F word'' in question for this group is feminism, though others come under its purview. The work spans decades, from an apt updating of a Flemish Madonna and child by the estimable and too long overlooked Anita Steckel, to very recent art by Dana Frankfort, Jane Hammond and Shay Nowick. In a brand-new piece, Elaine Reichek brings Ezra Pound into the picture. Ulrike Muller pays tribute to Mina Loy. Patricia Cronin contributes an image of a tomb sculpture she designed, depicting herself and her lover, the artist Deborah Kass (also in the show), embracing on a bed. Cynthia Broan Gallery, 546 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 760-0809, cynthiabroan.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)"
2007-03-16T00:00:00Z,"IN Philip Taaffe's book nothing is ever used up. Any motif, whether man-made or taken directly from nature, can have a new and vital life, with proper placement and adjustments in scale and color, of course. Ditto any technique. This point is driven home by the suavely eye-popping new paintings in Mr. Taaffe's latest show at the uptown Gagosian Gallery. They partake of everything from Northwest Coast Indian masks to Islamic ornamental patterns to marbleizing and gilding, and the word recycling doesn't begin to do them justice. These works serve notice that Mr. Taaffe is one of the best painters of his generation, one who has extended both 1970s Pattern and Decoration and the '80s practices of appropriation and juxtaposition into new areas. He has been aided by important cues from his elders -- Warhol's washy colors and ghostly, touch-free surfaces, and Jackson Pollock's all-over dripped unities. He has warmed up and slowed down these twin peaks of technique with his own brand of weirdly nonchalant labor-intensiveness. Once you absorb the dazzle and cultural references of Mr. Taaffe's surfaces, you may spend time simply trying to fathom how they are made."

2007-03-16T00:00:00Z,"Cheim & Read 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea Through March 24 Bill Jensen has never settled down with one style, although he's probably best known for paintings that feature eerie biomorphic shapes hovering in caverns of deep space: strange, seductive canvases that are the visual equivalents of weird progressive rock songs, and were inspired by American artists like Arthur Dove and Albert Pinkham Ryder, who fall mostly outside the reigning postwar painting dialogues."

WARNS ON ACCOUNTING General Motors, a company once known as the model of corporate accounting, warned investors that its performance was threatened by ''ineffective'' controls over financial reporting. [C3.] CADBURY TO GO TWO WAYS Cadbury Schweppes, which is based in Britain, said that it planned to split off its American beverage unit, which makes Dr Pepper and Snapple drinks, from its candy businesses, after pressure from shareholders. Separating the businesses would help Cadbury focus on its confectionary unit, which analysts consider to be the center of the company. [C3.] A GAUGE OF INFLATION GOES UP Prices rose broadly and sharply for businesses in February as an array of goods, from children's toys to tobacco, became more expensive.

[C4.] TRIBUNE OFFER LOSING FAVOR A proposal from Sam Zell, the Chicago real estate billionaire, to purchase the Tribune Company is falling from favor, according to people close to the situation. [C4.] TWO BANKS, ONE PARTNERSHIP Carver Federal Savings Bank, the country's largest black financial institution, and Merrill Lynch have struck an unusual alliance that will provide the Wall Street firm entree into minority neighborhoods. [C7.] MARKETS OVERCOME INFLATION DATA Stocks managed a moderate advance as signs of strength in corporate takeover activity, jobs and overseas markets allowed investors to stomach a sharp rise in wholesale inflation.

Begosh and begorrah, it's the New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade, and tomorrow is the 246th annual version. The marchers step off at 11 a.m. at Fifth Avenue and 44th Street and strut and shout and jump and jig their way up the avenue to 86th Street, and then many fan out to the bars across the Upper East Side. The viewing, above, is grand from anywhere you stand along the avenue. Suggested admission is a shouting voice and an outfit of green. As much a tradition as the kilts, pipes and broad banners honoring Irish counties is the sublime chaos along the parade route: the laughing lasses with ''Kiss Me, I'm Irish'' shirts; the reserves of rowdies with smuggled-in hooch from the suburbs; the proud old gentlemen in wool sweaters and caps; the bands of bored policemen directing pedestrians; and the hometown hustlers hawking green plastic derbies. Related activities around the city tomorrow include the traditional Solemn Pontifical Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, 50th Street and Fifth Avenue, at 8:30 a.m., and a traditional St. Patrick's Day Mass conducted in Irish Gaelic at St. Agnes's Church, 143 East 43rd Street, Manhattan, at 10 a.m., with Father Michael O'Shea from County Kerry celebrating the service, along with Father Aiden O'Driscoll from County Cork.

The former mayor, Joseph J. Santopietro, who was a consultant for Diversified Waste Disposal, admitted participating in a scheme in which trash haulers carved out routes for one another and agreed not to poach customers, prosecutors said.

Chuck West, president of the Newark Firefighters Union, said that off-duty firefighters and police personnel who would have been able to take part in the parade were being asked to stay away. In December the congressman, Donald M. Payne, was among 31 House members who voted against a resolution, which eventually passed, condemning a French town&#8217;s decision to name a street in honor of Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted in 1982 of killing Officer Daniel Faulkner. A federal judge overturned Mr. Abu-Jamal&#8217;s death sentence in 2001 but upheld his conviction, and appeals from both sides are pending. Mr. Payne, a Democrat who has represented Newark since 1989, did not return phone calls seeking comment, but he has said he shares in the anger over the murder of Officer Faulkner. He has said his reasons for objecting to the resolution include his belief that it would be &#8220;setting a poor precedent by involving Congress in the affairs of a French town.&#8221;."

Since 2005, 42 of the state&#8217;s most vulnerable plants have been forced to evaluate ways to reduce risks, and several have changed chemicals or processes. Mr. Corzine&#8217;s proposal would require more stringent regulations to be adopted at 52 additional facilities, including water treatment plants and food processing factories, which use deadly chlorine gas. If adopted by the Legislature, the regulations would be among the tightest in the nation. Rick Hind, legislative director for the Greenpeace toxics campaign, urged Congress not to enact a Bush administration proposal, supported by the chemical industry, that would allow looser federal guidelines to supersede New Jersey&#8217;s regulations."

(National Geographic) GALÁPAGOS Until a few centuries ago, this isolated archipelago — 13 major volcanic islands, 6 smaller islands and 107 rocks and islets — off the coast of Ecuador remained a mystery to much of the world. Then a visit to the pristine islands, and their vast number of endemic species, in 1835 inspired Charles Darwin to come up with his theory of evolution by natural selection. Today the Galápagos’ rich environment has been increasingly decimated both by tourists and by local populations, who have introduced plants and animals that prey on native species and destroy their habitats. This new three-part special, made over 20 years, journeys from the rim of the Sierra Negra volcano on the island of Isabela to the active shores, retraces Darwin’s route and examines the efforts of conservationists to preserve this once-pristine oasis."

(National Geographic) GALÁPAGOS Until a few centuries ago, this isolated archipelago -- 13 major volcanic islands, 6 smaller islands and 107 rocks and islets -- off the coast of Ecuador remained a mystery to much of the world. Then a visit to the pristine islands, and their vast number of endemic species, in 1835 inspired Charles Darwin to come up with his theory of evolution by natural selection. Today the Galápagos' rich environment has been increasingly decimated both by tourists and by local populations, who have introduced plants and animals that prey on native species and destroy their habitats. This new three-part special, made over 20 years, journeys from the rim of the Sierra Negra volcano on the island of Isabela to the active shores, retraces Darwin's route and examines the efforts of conservationists to preserve this once-pristine oasis. 8 P.M.

2007-03-17T00:00:00Z,"On a Wing and a Prayer Leonardo da Vinci's ''Annunciation,'' the 15th-century masterpiece that almost never leaves its home in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy, safely reached the National Museum in Tokyo yesterday, the Associated Press reported. An Italian senator had earlier chained himself to the Uffizi to protest the lending of the work, which will anchor an exhibition called ''Italian Spring'' that opens on Tuesday. ''We verified that the condition of the painting is the same as when it left,'' said Antonio Godoli of the Uffizi. It is only the third time that ''The Annunciation,'' above, has left the museum. For the trip, the roughly 6 1/2--by-3-foot painting was encased in three protective crates filled with shock absorbers and sensors to monitor humidity and temperature. In its Tokyo gallery, the painting must be viewed through a $50,000 bulletproof crystal window, itself set into a steel case designed to survive an earthquake. The painting will be shown through June 17. The Albright-Knox Wins A New York State Supreme Court judge yesterday dismissed a lawsuit filed by a group seeking to stop the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo from auctioning more than 100 antiquities and pieces of Renaissance and medieval art to raise money to buy newer pieces. The judge, Diane Y. Devlin, declined a request for an injunction to stop the auctions, the first of which is scheduled to begin on Tuesday at Sotheby's in Manhattan. She said that the sales' opponents had failed to make a compelling case that the museum had deviated from its mission in deciding to sell the pieces, among other claims. Museum officials said the decision to sell was difficult, but that for an institution focused on mostly Modern and contemporary art, the antiquities were a luxury it could no longer afford. The sales are expected to add at least $15 million to the museum's $58 million endowment. Richard E. Stanton, a lawyer for the group opposing the sales, said no appeal was planned.

Dr. Laura Kuhn, the trust's executive director, will retain her post and join the Bard faculty as the John Cage professor of performance arts. A Penalty for Trashing Art A High Court judge in England has ordered an art storage company to pay £350,000 ($677,769) to a collector for accidentally destroying a sculpture by Anish Kapoor, a winner of the Turner Prize in 1991, the BBC reported yesterday. The judge ruled that the 1984 sculpture, ''Hole and Vessel II,'' was put in a trash hauling bin in 2004 and later destroyed at a waste plant. Fine Art Logistics initially offered to pay £587.13 ($1,137) for accidentally destroying the piece, which had been taken to it by Ofir Scheps, the work's owner.

Kasyanov, a former prime minister, to return a luxury home he bought from the state in 2004, ruling that he had acquired it illegally. Mr. Kasyanov, who served under President Vladimir V. Putin from 2000 to 2004, dismissed the decision as politically motivated and vowed to appeal, as he did when a court ordered the return a year ago. The purchase came under scrutiny after he declared his opposition to Mr. Putin and vowed to run for president next year. STEVEN LEE MYERS"

2007-03-17T00:00:00Z,"Promising that he would be relentless in upholding his ''solemn responsibility'' to deter terrorist attacks at New Jersey's industrial facilities, Gov. Jon S. Corzine announced a proposal yesterday to enact tighter security measures at more than 50 plants that use the kind of deadly chemical gases that could pose a threat to thousands of people in the surrounding communities. Since 2005, 42 of the state's most vulnerable plants have been forced to evaluate ways to reduce risks, and several have changed chemicals or processes. Mr. Corzine's proposal would require more stringent regulations to be adopted at 52 additional facilities, including water treatment plants and food processing factories, which use deadly chlorine gas. If adopted by the Legislature, the regulations would be among the tightest in the nation. Rick Hind, legislative director for the Greenpeace toxics campaign, urged Congress not to enact a Bush administration proposal, supported by the chemical industry, that would allow looser federal guidelines to supersede New Jersey's regulations.

2007-03-18T20:06:32Z,"My last column told the story of the diminishing scope of the establishment clause of the Constitution. Once understood as prohibiting state actions that endorse, benefit or advance religion, the clause has in recent decades been re-read in ways that permit, among other things, taxpayer financing of evangelical student newspapers and the construction of buildings at sectarian (mostly Christian) schools. This result has been accomplished by shifting the inquiry from the traditional establishment clause question - does this amount to government funding of religious activities? - to a free expression clause question - would denying the religious institution this benefit or subsidy be an unfair instance of viewpoint discrimination? By substituting the requirement of fairness for an investigation of a law's effects, the courts have moved dramatically away from James Madison's insistence that not even three pence of public funds should be spent for religious purposes and have rendered the establishment clause nugatory.Some of those who commented on the column attributed the pattern I described to the nefarious forces of organized religion or to the machinations of the Bush administration (always the default villain for Times readers), but a deeper explanation might be found in a religion-clause jurisprudence so fissured that one might even call it schizophrenic. The division is between two views of the assumptions that should be kept in mind when an establishment clause case or a free exercise case is being adjudicated. One view stresses history and cultural traditions; the other embraces the iron logic of principle."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"ENLOE--Emma. Our beloved mother and grandmother, Emma Bonnadell Clibourn Enloe, aged 90, died peacefully at her home in New York City, surrounded by family and friends, on March 15, 2007. Mrs. Enloe was born on her family's farm in Cole County, Missouri, where she grew up before graduating from Jefferson City High School. She worked for many years in the Missouri State Department of Revenue and later as an administrator at Charles E. Still Hospital. Mrs. Enloe was an active member of the First Baptist Church and a regular participant in local Democratic politics. She was born August 21, 1916, near Russellville, Missouri, a daughter of Charles Adolph and Estella Clilbourn, who predeceased her, as did her sister Margaret Clilbourn Pealer and her brother James Clibourn. Mrs. Enloe leaves a daughter, Sharon E. Baum, and a son, David H. Enloe, both of Manhattan, where Mrs. Enloe lived and worked for over 40 rears after joining her children there. She is also survived by two sons-in law, Stephen H. Baum and Ronald Harte, as well as a grandson, Benjamin Clibourn Baum and his wife Heather Gaillard of Minneapolis, and a second grandson, Samuel David Baum, of Los Angeles. A private funeral service was held yesterday at the Church of the Resurrection in Manhattan, with interment in a local New York City Cemetery. Her spirit of strength and determination will be an inspiration to all of us for the rest of our lives. The family requests that any donations be made to the First Baptist Church of Jefferson City Missouri or to Ms. Trudy Lampert, I Love Animals, 136 East 64th Street, New York, NY 10021."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"Suddenly, everything seemed oddly familiar in Albany, with the governor praising one house of the legislature while accusing the other of stalling. When there are three sources of power, as there are in New York State's lawmaking apparatus, it often comes down to two against one. And the only difference between this dynamic and any ordinary sandlot tussle is that the odd man out -- in this case, the Republican leader of the State Senate, Joseph Bruno -- is capable of making lots of mischief. Last week, lawmakers put forward their budget proposals so that there are now three budgets on the table. Gov. Eliot Spitzer has proposed a $120.6 billion budget. The Assembly calls for $121.2 billion in spending, and the Senate version is the fattest of all, which is odd coming from Republicans who usually boast about fiscal responsibility. Their budget tops out at over $123 billion."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"Even when skies are clear and the nation's air traffic control system is running perfectly, airlines have to contend with problems that cause delays. The 482 Boeing 737s that Southwest Airlines operates make about 3,200 flights a day. As at other airlines, something is always going wrong. In daily internal reports, Fred Taylor Jr., senior manager of proactive customer communications at Southwest, gives a lighthearted, at times sketchy recap of the operating mayhem that is airline routine. The reports are used by others at Southwest to explain delays to customers. Excerpts from December 2006: DEC. 9 -- Salt Lake City-to-Los Angeles flight took off and then returned after ''a rather large bird took the scenic route through the left engine.'' Inspection found no problem. Departed again 1 hour, 15 minutes late. DEC. 11 -- Chicago-to-Phoenix flight diverted to Denver for medical emergency. CPR was performed and the onboard defibrillator was used. New Orleans-to-Dallas flight lands with an ''unresponsive customer.'' ''Not sure if we got a deep sleeper, someone with an extreme hangover, or otherwise.'' DEC. 23 -- ''On a serious note,'' a Manchester-to-Baltimore flight ''had a customer pass away upon arrival.'' ''On a less serious note, the Burger King in the [Sacramento] airport had a grease fire causing a five-minute evacuation -- no fries, chips.'' (A spokeswoman for the Burger King outlet, Bryn Punt, said there was smoke but no fire.) DEC. 24 -- ''One woman was full of the Christmas spirit of peace and good will toward mankind, and while traveling,'' Phoenix-to-El Paso, ''she hit another woman. A nice way to spend Christmas Eve in the [El Paso] jail.'' DEC. 26 -- Phoenix-to-Reno flight hit ''severe turbulence on approach'' to Reno and diverted to Oakland. Three hours later, flight canceled and passengers bused to Reno. Two planes pushing back from the gates in San Diego bumped into each other. Both returned to the gates and passengers were put on other flights. ''Our folks are conducting an investigation and working with the'' National Transportation Safety Board.

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"IT WAS JUST BAD P.R. The News -- Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales said on Tuesday that the dismissals of federal prosecutors had been badly handled but were not improper, and that he would not resign. Behind the News -- It can't be a good sign when your boss says publicly that he is ''frankly not happy'' about an embarrassing bungle of yours, as President Bush did on Wednesday. Congressional critics, unpersuaded that the dismissals were not a political purge, geared up later in the week to issue subpoenas, as pressure kept on mounting on Mr. Gonzales to step down. THE LENDER WAS SUBPRIME The News -- New Century Financial, the huge, struggling subprime mortgage lender, said in a regulatory filing Monday that its banks had frozen its credit lines. Trading in its stock was suspended, and investors rushed to sell shares of other financial companies, sending stock indexes tumbling. Behind the News -- New Century's once profitable, now risky strategy of lending to people with dicey credit has been coming apart for months as the housing market cooled, but Wall Street woke up late: just a day before it went into default, Morgan Stanley extended the company new credit. WISHES HE HADN'T TOLD The News -- Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said on Tuesday that he should not have discussed his view that homosexuality was immoral in an interview with The Chicago Tribune on Monday. Behind the News -- General Pace reignited debate about the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which bans openly gay people from the service but tolerates those who keep their homosexuality private. The general insisted he was only trying to support the policy; instead, he made himself a lightning rod for critics who say the policy stopped making sense long ago. KEEPING BAD COMPANY The News -- Chiquita Brands International, the fruit company, agreed on Wednesday to a $25 million fine to settle charges that it illegally paid a right-wing militia to protect its banana plantations in Colombia, and hid the payments on its books. Behind the News -- Much of the Colombian countryside is beyond government control, and it is not unusual for foreign companies operating there to buy protection from shady groups. But Chiquita executives ignored warnings from the company's own lawyers that it was improperly doing business with drug-dealing terrorists. THE SHOW CAN'T GO ON The News -- A concert by the Who in Tampa, Fla., on Tuesday ended halfway through the first song when Roger Daltrey, the lead singer, abruptly walked off. Behind the News -- Mr. Daltrey, 63, had taken the stage despite having bronchitis that left him barely able to talk, never mind sing in his usual leather-lunged style, as his surprised bandmate Pete Townshend told the crowd after walking off after him to find out what was wrong. Mr. Townshend announced that the show would be rescheduled for March 25. The song Mr. Daltrey couldn't finish? It was ''I Can't Explain.''"

He attended Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in Washington, D.C., where he formed many notable associations including a close personal friendship with the future President of the United States William Jefferson Clinton.

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"The old days don't look terribly good in Lionel Rogosin's narrative documentary ''ON THE BOWERY'' (1956), but they do look astonishing. A slice of down-and-out life, this black-and-white (and newly restored) portrait of lost New York tracks the arrival and rapid downward spiral of a young man (Ray Sayler), who lands on the Bowery with a suitcase and a deceitful thirst. He soon falls in with an old timer (an excellent Gorman Hendricks), whose face is creased with cunning and booze. A sympathetic view from the gutter, the film balances gritty documentation with obviously scripted interludes, affirming that the greatest nonfiction films aren't a question of nominal objectivity, but morality. Writing in The New York Times the indefatigable Bosley Crowther noted that the film had picked up awards abroad, at the Venice Film Festival and elsewhere, but complained: ''This is a dismal exposition to be charging people money to see. You can see the same thing in many places in this city without going too far from where you live. Indeed, it is merely a good montage of good photographs of drunks and bums, scrutinized and listened to ad nauseam. And we mean ad nauseam!'' Exactly! Justly nominated in 1957 for an Oscar for best documentary (Jerome Hill's ''Albert Schweitzer'' won), ''On the Bowery'' is a classic of its kind and a must-see for anyone who cherishes the old soul of New York. Mr. Rogosin, a onetime long-time owner of the great and greatly lamented Bleecker Street Cinema, died in 2000 at the age of 76. A retrospective of his films is certainly overdue.

But since we can't know everything, a natural by-product of our highly adaptive intelligence may be to devise supernatural explanations."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"CAR trouble came naturally to our family. If we didn't quite invite it, we always made a place for it, expecting it and welcoming it. This is probably because my father never thought cars were anything you could much count on. You could depend on friends and family, possibly, and if material accessories were something you considered turning to, you might look to books or a decent fishing rod. But cars, no. He never did much to keep up the faux-woodie Country Squire, so when it got a flat, ran out of oil or started wheezing, it was just another sign of the innate frailty of the mechanical world. Whether he pulled over and called AAA or just kept puttering along, it was always with the same resigned acceptance. My 18-year-old son, Noel, is named for his grandfather. And though we didn't know this at the time we named him, he shares his grandfather's terseness, dry wit, laconic humor. Both also share a philosophical approach to things and the sense of equanimity that seems to spring from an ability to see life from all sides. It's a gift, to be sure, but one that can drive other people a little nuts. My father was a journalist, skilled in looking at things from all angles. ''He couldn't tell you what time it was without qualifying it,'' an exasperated friend of his once said. Likewise, even when Noel was young, he wasn't given much to direct answers. ''Is it blue?'' I might ask in a game of 20 questions. ''Some people might think so,'' he would reply."

Thanks to high gasoline prices, perpetually clogged highways and a strong economy, the three major commuter rail lines that serve the New York metropolitan area are handling more passengers than ever. Last year, ridership on New Jersey Transit trains jumped 6.8 percent, to 74 million, setting a record for the second consecutive year. Metro-North also hit a record last year, carrying 2.4 million additional riders. And the Long Island Rail Road, which saw a big decline in traffic after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, rose for the second straight year in 2006 after three years of decline."

While prior residency might have been best, residency status wasn't a secret to the voters on Election Day, and they chose accordingly, in a convincing fashion. The common-sense presumption: residency could be ''cured'' once the vote was known -- and before swearing-in."

Purdue players dove on the floor four times in the first half to corral loose balls, and with each lunge came the distinct screech of skin meeting the hardwood floor. By controlling the tempo and outhustling Florida, Purdue managed to do today what few thought they could -- hang with Florida. But guts and hustle can only carry a team so far, and Florida overcame a 7-point first-half deficit to advance to the Round of 16 with a 74-67 victory. They will head to St. Louis to play Butler, the Midwest Region's No. 5 seed, on Friday."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"It was a brazen defense, and in the end the jury didn't buy it. Andrew N. Yao, who was chief executive of the former Student Finance Corporation, claimed that he did not commit fraud when he lied in federal bankruptcy court about wiring $669,000 to his mistress at the time, a former Playboy Playmate of the Month. Though he initially said the money was for maintaining his private jets, he later acknowledged that it was for his girlfriend. But he said he wasn't trying to deceive his company's creditors or the court. He said he was lying only so that his family wouldn't find out about the affair."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"If only for the sake of convenience, everyone likes to play in the backyard. Hence the history of plays and musicals about the dramas that unfold when the curtain falls. Backstage stories are front and center this week, as two major openings pay tribute to the blood, sweat and greasepaint-tinged tears of the theatrical life. For his new comedy opening at Manhattan Theater Club, CHARLES BUSCH turned to a woman who rated a footnote in American history, not just theatrical annals. Laura Keene was an actress and manager whose path intersected with Abraham Lincoln's on a most unfortunate night for him. Keene was onstage at Ford's Theater in ''Our American Cousin,'' when Lincoln was felled by John Wilkes Booth. Mr. Busch's reverence for the gritty lives and sublime artistry of great actresses has informed his career as a playwright and actor. Reading history one day he got to wondering about the fate of the footnote. ''OUR LEADING LADY,'' which stars KATE MULGREW as Keene, mixes fact and fancy in imagining what went on backstage on that epochal evening. Opens Tuesday, City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or nycitycenter.org; $50. Funnily enough, murder most foul -- albeit fictional -- also plays a leading role in ''CURTAINS,'' the new musical starring DAVID HYDE PIERCE as a detective called in to investigate when backstage backstabbing becomes peculiarly vehement. Set in Boston in the 1959, where a troubled musical is trying out, ''Curtains'' won cheerful reviews at its own tryout last summer in Los Angeles. A mix of comedy, mystery and music, ''Curtains'' is particularly anticipated as a last encore for JOHN KANDER AND FRED EBB, the songwriting team whose careers were burnished anew by the recent revivals of ''Chicago'' and ''Cabaret.'' Their fruitful partnerships ended when Ebb died in 2004. Opens Thursday, Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200 or telecharge.com; $61.50 to $111.60."
2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: The cover story ''Patagonia in a New Light'' (March 4) undervalues scientists' views on climate change and glacial retreat a bit too much and too often. Having never visited Patagonia before, perhaps the glacial retreat situation there wasn't very obvious to the writer. He might want to consider other sites in the Andes, such as Peru's Quelccaya ice cap, where land beneath the glacier has been exposed for the first time in at least 5,000 years, and where the melting has accelerated in the last 30 years to the point that thousands of years of ice could disappear within just a few years."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"DR. ALAN ROSS did not develop a passion for school bus safety until 10 years ago, when his son asked why there were no safety belts on the bus he rode to school in Litchfield County, Conn. ''I was your typical parent, and I just assumed we had this covered in a school bus,'' said Dr. Ross, who is now the president of the National Coalition for School Bus Safety, a volunteer group.

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"SAT scores included in the New Jersey School Report Card this year were inaccurate because of a computer problem, the State Department of Education said last week. But students and parents have little to worry about, said Jon Zlock, a spokesman for the department. Colleges and universities will receive the correct test scores with students' applications; the score inaccuracies are only within the state system."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"123 Norma Road, Harrington Park, N.J. Midcentury modern, 4-bedroom house (1969-1977) My family integrated the neighborhood. My parents were among the earliest black executives at I.B.M., and they moved to northern New Jersey for work. The real estate agent said the house had been sold, which it hadn't. They confronted him. There was actually a melee. My father used to joke we were like the four raisins living in a tub of vanilla ice cream. But despite the trouble we had getting in, it turned out to be a very supportive community. 11 Parkhill Road, Harrington Park, N.J. Three-story converted barn with sauna (1977-1991) The house was a dramatic change. It was a gorgeous modern structure; it had a spiral staircase; there was an island in the kitchen. My father fought my mother to buy it, even though it was a financial stretch. It signified how far he had come from the segregated South. 35 Campus Drive, Palo Alto, Calif. 24-hour counseling center (1989-1990) My junior year at Stanford University, I lived in a tiny room in the back of the Bridge, an organization that did crisis counseling. I was one of five leaders there. It was the first time I dealt with staffers, budgets, fund-raising, communications. It was my first training as an executive. Queen's College, Oxford, England One-bedroom in 300-year-old dorm (1993-1994) I was on the second floor of this ancient college, with a beautiful sitting area, washroom and bedroom. They didn't have showers, just tubs. I met people there from New Zealand, Nigeria, all over the world, and I saw some of America's weaknesses through their eyes. I came away loving my country more deeply than before, but in a mature, textured way. 685 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, Newark, N.J. Two-bedroom apartment in affordable- housing development (1998-2006) During Yale Law School, I moved to Newark. I lived in Brick Towers, a housing development in the Central Ward. The rent was $575 a month. It was a violent area. There was a crack house across the street. The heat stopped working. Hot water was rare. The elevators only worked when they wanted to. We fought a big battle against the landlord, and we got the buildings handed over to the federal government. 435 Hawthorne Avenue, Newark, N.J. Three-bedroom apartment in a townhouse (2006-present) The beauty of this place is that it has hot water every day. It is nice and spacious. The rent is $1,200 a month. I have a bedroom, an office and a workout room. But this is the South Ward. There are drug and crime issues. There have been shootings. Now as mayor my responsibility is to keep every neighborhood safe in the city. I want to be in the midst of it. Unfortunately, I have had death threats, so I have security all the time."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I respectfully disagree with some elements of your editorial about the practice of eminent domain (''Don't Cripple Eminent Domain,'' March 11). It is my view that unless in the rarest of circumstances, eminent domain should not be used. A vital part of the American dream is land ownership, and while redevelopment of our cities is important, it pales in comparison to the right of individuals to keep their land until they, not government officials, see fit.

Very charismatic, filled with high energy and joy of life. The legal profession has lost one of its eagles. He will be missed by all those he touched.

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"North Korea sent mixed signals on its nuclear disarmament plans on Saturday, claiming that it had begun preparations to shut down its main facility for making nuclear fuel but also that it would not take action unless it received all the money frozen when the United States slapped financial penalties on a Macao bank. As a new round of nuclear talks was scheduled to get under way in Beijing on Monday, Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea's envoy, said the country ''will not stop its nuclear activity'' until its full $25 million at Banco Delta Asia in Macao is returned. The United States maintains that the return of the money is now up to banking officials in Macao, a Chinese territory."

He later chose to launch a completely unwarranted assault on the other player with a weapon (his hockey stick ) to his face. The N.H.L. has consistently sent ridiculous messages to its players, wrist slaps at best."

Bloomberg's latest proposed reforms of the New York City school system: I would direct readers to The Times's Jan. 28 editorial ''New York's Public Schools,'' which observed that the reforms potentially undermine successful schools, deprive principals of necessary support services, and rush into action budgetary reallocations whose consequences have not been fully considered by the administration or aired before the public."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I thought that ''Boulder, Colo.: Fine Dining With a Hippie Past'' (Surfacing, Feb. 25) was misinformed and misleading. I grew up in Boulder, and my family was and still is actively involved in the local food community. I pride myself on having grown up with a sense of gourmet food. and we certainly frequented diverse restaurants on a weekly basis -- none of which I can recall serving ''mush like overcooked lentils and brown rice.'' That statement, in my opinion, is insulting to longstanding Boulder establishments. If the reporter had done proper research instead of making bold generalized statements, she would have come across restaurants like Laudisio, Pasta Jay's, John's, Mediterranean, Orchid Pavilion, 14th St. Bar and Grill, the Greenbriar Inn, Flagstaff House and Lucile's."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"Suddenly, everything seemed oddly familiar in Albany, with the governor praising one house of the legislature while accusing the other of stalling. When there are three sources of power, as there are in New York State's lawmaking apparatus, it often comes down to two against one. And the only difference between this dynamic and any ordinary sandlot tussle is that the odd man out -- in this case, the Republican leader of the State Senate, Joseph Bruno -- is capable of making lots of mischief. Last week, lawmakers put forward their budget proposals so that there are now three budgets on the table. Gov. Eliot Spitzer has proposed a $120.6 billion budget. The Assembly calls for $121.2 billion in spending, and the Senate version is the fattest of all, which is odd coming from Republicans who usually boast about fiscal responsibility. Their budget tops out at over $123 billion."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"CAR trouble came naturally to our family. If we didn't quite invite it, we always made a place for it, expecting it and welcoming it. This is probably because my father never thought cars were anything you could much count on. You could depend on friends and family, possibly, and if material accessories were something you considered turning to, you might look to books or a decent fishing rod. But cars, no. He never did much to keep up the faux-woodie Country Squire, so when it got a flat, ran out of oil or started wheezing, it was just another sign of the innate frailty of the mechanical world. Whether he pulled over and called AAA or just kept puttering along, it was always with the same resigned acceptance. My 18-year-old son, Noel, is named for his grandfather. And though we didn't know this at the time we named him, he shares his grandfather's terseness, dry wit, laconic humor. Both also share a philosophical approach to things and the sense of equanimity that seems to spring from an ability to see life from all sides. It's a gift, to be sure, but one that can drive other people a little nuts. My father was a journalist, skilled in looking at things from all angles. ''He couldn't tell you what time it was without qualifying it,'' an exasperated friend of his once said. Likewise, even when Noel was young, he wasn't given much to direct answers. ''Is it blue?'' I might ask in a game of 20 questions. ''Some people might think so,'' he would reply."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"A Dobbs Ferry man is suing the village after its Board of Trustees voted last week to block a referendum on changing the date of local elections to March from November. The referendum had been approved by the village clerk. The suit is the latest move in a politically charged saga that has pitted town Democrats against members of a splinter faction, the Dobbs Ferry Party. Three years ago, after the Dobbs Ferry Party took control of the village government, Democrats forced a referendum that changed the date of local elections to November, putting them on the same ballot as state and national races. After the date change, Democrats regained their majority on the town's seven-member Board of Trustees."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"Schumann: Symphonies Nos. 2, 4 Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, conducted by Riccardo Chailly. Decca 475 835-2; CD. EUGENE ORMANDY, a conductor known for malapropic pronouncements at rehearsals of the Philadelphia Orchestra, once said (more or less), ''Stravinsky wanted it like this, but he's dead, poor man, so let's do it my way.'' The idea of sacred texts has had a friend in the early-music movement, but with varying stealth, conductors have been doing it ''their way'' for a long time. Mahler, for one, felt no shame in ''improving'' Schumann's Second and Fourth Symphonies, and his retouchings come to us from Riccardo Chailly and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra."

They also lurk in the private thoughts of a generation in Congress: men like Senators Chuck Hagel and John McCain, who lived through the earlier war, vote on the current one and, despite their shared past, now disagree profoundly on what the United States should do next. 1 A Divide on Speech Case A Supreme Court case about the free-speech rights of high school students has opened an unexpected fissure between the Bush administration and its usual allies on the religious right.

Decca B0007260-02; CD. JANINE JANSEN'S first recording, a vibrant chamber-scale account of Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons,'' was remarked on as much for its cover art -- a reclining Ms. Jansen in a gauzy, low-cut dress, dangling her violin over the arm of a chair -- as for the playing. Had the performance been less striking, that would have been that. But this young Dutch violinist proved a lively, imaginative interpreter with a strong technique and a sweet, rich tone. Now she has jumped to the heart of the Romantic concerto repertory, where those assets play on a larger stage and under a brighter spotlight."

However, Ezekiel Emanuel's review (Feb. 18) ignores its rich content in order to claim that ''Medical Apartheid'' fails to place the experience of African-Americans in context. He dramatically misrepresents the work within an untrustworthy review that is rife with distortions, contradictions, errors, exaggerations and confusions."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (National Geographic) GALÁPAGOS -- Until a few centuries ago, this isolated archipelago -- 13 major volcanic islands, 6 smaller islands and 107 rocks and islets -- off the coast of Ecuador remained a mystery to much of the world. Then a visit to the pristine islands, and their vast number of endemic species (like these masked boobies, above), in 1835 inspired Charles Darwin to come up with his theory of evolution by natural selection. Today the Galápagos' rich environment has been increasingly decimated both by tourists and by local populations, who have introduced plants and animals that prey on native species and destroy their habitats. This new three-part special, made over 20 years, journeys from the rim of the Sierra Negra volcano on the island of Isabela to the active shores, retraces Darwin's route and examines the efforts of conservationists to preserve this once-pristine oasis. 8 P.M.

The water was very salty and refreshing and very warm -- about 80 degrees. It's very nice to have summer in the wintertime, to take a vacation in the winter, especially when you live in Sweden. And it's also great to take a vacation and see something new, to experience a new culture, especially one like Zanzibar's, which is a mix of Arabian, African and Indian cultures.

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"TAYLOR--Shirley Anna Hopkins Taylor, of Kirby, Montana died peacefully Tuesday, February 27, 2007, in Billings, MT following a stroke. She was born September 29, 1923, in Chicago. Shirley was the only child of Farley Hopkins and Margaret von Maur Hopkins. She was raised in Chicago and Lake Forest and graduated from Ethel Walker's School in Connecticut. Her first trip to the west was as a guest at the HF Bar Ranch near Buffalo, WY in the mid-1930s. She married Walter Jennings Taylor on April 15, 1944, in Lake Forest, Ill. They began their life together in Cold Spring Harbor, NY and moved to Kirby, MT -50 miles by gravel road from Sheridan, WY-in the winter of 1949 after Walt purchased the Dick Glenn ranch. Leaving behind everything she had known, Shirley began her new life in ranching by moving into a two-bedroom and one-bath cabin with a newborn baby and two children, ages two and four. Shirley shared more than 60 wonderful years with Walt, becoming involved in ranching and many local activities around Sheridan and Aspen, CO where they had a home for many years. She was an accomplished breeder of Thoroughbred racehorses, owning many Group 1 stake winners. She was a part owner of the well-known racehorse Alleged, winner at the Curragh in 1976 and the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe in 1977 and 1978. She parlayed her winnings from Alleged into a very successful mare breeding program. She was active in many causes over the years and instrumental in the formation of the Big Horn Equestrian Center in Big Horn, WY. She served as: a board member in various capacities at the Memorial Hospital of Sheridan County in the early 1950s; one of the few female members of the Jockey Club beginning in 1989, the President of the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association from 1984 to 1987; and a member of the Board of Directors of Sheridan Memorial Hospital Foundation from 1997 to 2001. Shirley was preceded in death by her parents and husband, Walt. She is survived by her four children: James Taylor and his wife Anne of Billings and their children Marett Taylor and Farley (Stuart) Lansing; Susanna Meyer and her husband David of St. Paul, MN and their children David Meyer, Etta Meyer, Stacy Meyer and Stephanie (John) Levy; Walter Watty Taylor, Jr. and his wife Lila of Kirby and their children Kirby Taylor, Peter (Amanda) Taylor, and Walter Jay (Cherie) Taylor III; and Margaret Margie Taylor of Bozeman. She also treasured her great grandson Will (Jay and Cherie) and her many cousins, nieces and nephews. Memorial services were held 3:00 pm Friday, March 9 at St. Peters Episcopal Church in Sheridan, WY. Memorials in lieu of flowers may be made to Heart of the Valley Animal Shelter, PO Box 11390, Bozeman, MT 59719; GraysonJockey Club Research Foundation, 821 Corporate Drive, Lexington, KY 40503; or Big Horn Equestrian Center, PO Box 6413, Sheridan, WY 82801. Bullis Mortuary of Hardin. MT has been entrusted with the services."
2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"Several pianists are poised to claim attention this week. In January 2006 INGRID FLITER, an Argentine pianist living in Milan, was the recipient of the Gilmore Artist Award, a prize of $300,000 bestowed on an unsuspecting pianist. Ms. Fliter will finally have a major recital appearance in New York, performing works by Beethoven, Schubert and Chopin at Carnegie Hall. I have yet to catch a live performance by the young Russian pianist NIKOLAI LUGANSKY, winner of the 1994 Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow. His impressive recordings include a 2000 Erato release of his scintillating yet refined accounts of the complete Chopin études. He is the soloist on Sunday afternoon at Lincoln Center with the Russian National Orchestra, playing Rachmaninoff's ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini,'' with Mikhail Pletnev conducting. And the excellent and probing Canadian pianist LOUIS LORTIE plays a recital of works by Liszt and Chopin juxtaposed with bracing scores by the audaciously original British composer Thomas Ades. Ms. Fliter, Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $35 to $40. Mr. Lugansky, Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $69. Mr. Lortie, Saturday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $24 to $82. Every year Young Concert Artists presents a program of new and recent works by emerging composers who have been heralded by this estimable organization. Monday's concert at Carnegie Hall offers works by MASON BATES, BENJAMIN C. S. BOYLE, DANIEL KELLOGG, KEVIN PUTS and KENJI BUNCH. The performers, naturally, include Young Concert Artists alumni. 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $35. Those wanting to prep themselves for the Metropolitan Opera's production next season of Philip Glass's ''Satyagraha'' might attend the Collegiate Chorale's presentation of ''THE JUNIPER TREE,'' a chamber opera composed by Mr. Glass and Robert Moran based on the Grimm Brothers fairy tale. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $65. Meanwhile at the Met BEN HEPPNER, continuing to branch out from the Wagnerian tenor repertory, sings the heroic title role in Giordano's impassioned ''ANDREA CHÉNIER,'' which opens this week. Thursday at 7:30 p.m., (212) 362-6000, metoperafamily.org; $15 to $175."

''It's not bad,'' she said finally. ''A little pitchy at times, but decent overall tone. Not the best performance we've seen this season, but it's all right. Good enough for the next round.''"
2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"IN many ways, commuter railroads are a victim of their own success. Thanks to high gasoline prices, perpetually clogged highways and a strong economy, the three major commuter rail lines that serve the New York metropolitan area are handling more passengers than ever. Last year, ridership on New Jersey Transit trains jumped 6.8 percent, to 74 million, setting a record for the second consecutive year. Metro-North also hit a record last year, carrying 2.4 million additional riders. And the Long Island Rail Road, which saw a big decline in traffic after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, rose for the second straight year in 2006 after three years of decline."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"At various moments in his career GILBERTO GIL put forth some of the last century's great pop records (a short list: the pop-art bricolage ''Gilberto Gil,'' from 1968; the moody mixtures of pop-funk and Brazilian roots styles in ''Refavela,'' from 1975; and ''Refazenda,'' from 1977). Happily, his latest record to be released here, ''Gil Luminoso'' (DRG), can be listed among those. It's a retrospective of his own music, recorded in 1999 and originally packaged to accompany a Brazilian book about his work. The record contains 15 songs with just voice and guitar, and it represents not a weary I've-tried-everything-else move, but the core of Mr. Gil's aesthetic. Underneath his records has always been this: a brilliant small-scale singer-songwriter with guitar. Do your best to see Mr. Gil this week at Carnegie Hall. He seldom plays here, given his job as Brazil's minister of culture, and few performers are better at radiating generosity. As on the album, the concert will be just Mr. Gil and his guitar, which hasn't happened in New York before. Tuesday at 8 pm, Isaac Stern Auditorium, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $72. The inventive band Animal Collective has been sluicing out records over the last few years with a highly malleable sense of what a group is. Some records that sound like a full band involve just one or two of the four members. They do side projects too, and the best yet is ''Person Pitch,'' by PANDA BEAR, the band's drummer and singer, which comes out on Tuesday from the label Paw Tracks. Pity he's not from California; if he were, geography would confirm that he is the artistic heir to Brian Wilson and Lindsay Buckingham. Instead Panda Bear's vocal-choir harmonies and tribal rhythms will have to be understood purely as products of the imagination."
2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"DR. ALAN ROSS did not develop a passion for school bus safety until 10 years ago, when his son asked why there were no safety belts on the bus he rode to school in Litchfield County, Conn. ''I was your typical parent, and I just assumed we had this covered in a school bus,'' said Dr. Ross, who is now the president of the National Coalition for School Bus Safety, a volunteer group. ''That started my quest to improve things. The state of school bus transportation is a very sad one.''"
2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Pay raises are long overdue for New York's judiciary, which has maintained its longstanding excellence even in the face of staggering caseloads and increasingly complex legal issues (''Upgrading New York's Courts,'' editorial, March 11). The continuing failure to provide judicial salary increases is simply unwise public policy. The disparity between private-sector and judicial salaries grows every year. Any 2007 first-year associate at a major Manhattan law firm will immediately earn more than every judge in the state, including Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye. The more this disparity widens, the more difficult it will be to both attract and retain a qualified and dedicated judiciary."
2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''History, Digitized (and Abridged)'' (March 11), about the far-from-complete digitization of important documents and other materials: It is depressing to think of what will not be known if the triage that is necessary to make selections of digital-worthy documents is shaped by profit-making entities. The best history often results from the discovery of papers once considered to have no lasting importance."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"One of the more interesting underdogs in recent N.C.A.A. tournament history emerged in 2004, when a Nevada point guard named Todd Okeson led the No. 10-seeded Wolf Pack to upsets of Michigan State and Gonzaga in the first two rounds. Okeson had the straight-from-central-casting story: he was from Weskan, Kan., a town of about 300 people, and he had received no other Division I scholarship offers. When asked how he could tell that Okeson was from a small town, one of Okeson's teammates gave a particularly memorable answer. ''Man, he cuts his own hair,'' the player responded, indignantly."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"Choreographers will bring all sorts of people together this week in works that can be considered microcosms of the human experience. H. T. Chen is mingling members of his company, H. T. CHEN AND DANCERS, with ordinary people in ''Apple Dreams,'' his new site-specific work in the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center. With its barrel-vaulted glass atrium dominated by 16 giant palm trees, the space itself is a spectacle. And Mr. Chen is filling it with professional dancers, families and elderly people in pedicabs in a celebration of urban bustle and urban hope, a theme that will be emphasized as parents happily pause and lift their babies to the trees. Rehearsals are open to the public too. Friday and next Saturday at 7 p.m., 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. Dancers, percussionists and artists from Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Haiti, Ivory Coast and France will be gathering when TAMANGO'S URBAN TAP presents ''Bay Mo Dilo'' (''Give Me Water''), an exploration of the mythology and culture of global Creole heritage.

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''The Hospital's Bill of Rights,'' by Brett Harwood (Op-Ed, March 4), about how to save New Jersey's medical centers, does not acknowledge a critical point. In the United States there are annually 2 million cases of hospital-associated infection, resulting in approximately 90,000 deaths. This death rate is increasing rapidly because of the appearance of new strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The average hospital-associated infection requires extra days in the hospital and is expensive to treat. As a result, the overall annual cost to hospitals exceeds $30 billion. This places a huge financial burden on the system and greatly undermines the standard of care."

The move provided Boston College's players with a unique perspective, having played in two of the top conferences. The conferences have produced five of the past six N.C.A.A. tournament champions, including Syracuse (2003) and Connecticut (2004) of the Big East, and Duke (2001), Maryland (2002) and North Carolina (2005) of the A.C.C."

Thanks to high gasoline prices, perpetually clogged highways and a strong economy, the three major commuter rail lines that serve the New York metropolitan area are handling more passengers than ever. Last year, ridership on New Jersey Transit trains jumped 6.8 percent, to 74 million, setting a record for the second consecutive year. Metro-North also hit a record last year, carrying 2.4 million additional riders. And the Long Island Rail Road, which saw a big decline in traffic after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, rose for the second straight year in 2006 after three years of decline."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"CAR trouble came naturally to our family. If we didn't quite invite it, we always made a place for it, expecting it and welcoming it. This is probably because my father never thought cars were anything you could much count on. You could depend on friends and family, possibly, and if material accessories were something you considered turning to, you might look to books or a decent fishing rod. But cars, no. He never did much to keep up the faux-woodie Country Squire, so when it got a flat, ran out of oil or started wheezing, it was just another sign of the innate frailty of the mechanical world. Whether he pulled over and called AAA or just kept puttering along, it was always with the same resigned acceptance. My 18-year-old son, Noel, is named for his grandfather. And though we didn't know this at the time we named him, he shares his grandfather's terseness, dry wit, laconic humor. Both also share a philosophical approach to things and the sense of equanimity that seems to spring from an ability to see life from all sides. It's a gift, to be sure, but one that can drive other people a little nuts. My father was a journalist, skilled in looking at things from all angles. ''He couldn't tell you what time it was without qualifying it,'' an exasperated friend of his once said. Likewise, even when Noel was young, he wasn't given much to direct answers. ''Is it blue?'' I might ask in a game of 20 questions. ''Some people might think so,'' he would reply."

A. Yes, with one exception.

But Barack Obama's strong challenge to Hillary Clinton and Rudolph W. Giuliani's recent surge past Senator John McCain in the polls raise an interesting question: How much does experience matter now in presidential politics? After 9/11 it seemed that high-level government experience would be more important than ever. And yet, neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Giuliani have the kind of governing experience traditionally seen as a prerequisite for White House service. Mr. Obama spent nine years in the Illinois State Senate and two years in the United States Senate, while Mr. Giuliani has served two terms as mayor of New York."

2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"America's 21st-century wars are inspiring a wave of fact-based filmmaking, and several of the more acclaimed results are washing up on television this week. Sundance Channel presents a double bill on Monday night: Patricia Foulkrod's examination of the American soldier's experience from recruitment to homecoming, ''THE GROUND TRUTH,'' which was shortlisted for best documentary feature at the Oscars (9 p.m.); and Michael Winterbottom's and Mat Whitecross's film about British citizens detained by the United States as terror suspects, ''THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO,'' winner of the Independent Spirit Award for best documentary (10:15). On Tuesday night at 7, Cinemax's Reel Life documentary series presents ''IRAQ IN FRAGMENTS,'' James Longley's impressionistic portrait of daily life in the country. A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film, an Oscar nominee for best documentary, ''entrancingly, almost disturbingly beautiful.'' Fallbrook, Calif. -- near Camp Pendleton -- might not be the first place you think of when you think bed-and-breakfast. But what if you could stumble downstairs and have your eggs en cocotte cooked by Tori Spelling? That's the promise of ''TORI & DEAN: INN LOVE,'' a new reality series on Oxygen (10:30 p.m. Tuesday), in which a very pregnant Ms. Spelling, with the help of her husband, Dean McDermott, tries to eke out her $800,000 inheritance by running a B&B in San Diego County. Other stops on the B-list: ''DANCING WITH THE STARS'' begins on ABC (8 p.m. Monday) with built-in plot lines centering on John Ratzenberger, nobly subbing for Vincent Pastore, and Heather Mills, nobly trying a dance competition with a prosthetic leg. And the 2007 MISS USA pageant on NBC (9 p.m. Friday) brings the reign of Tara Conner to an end."
2007-03-18T00:00:00Z,"Five years ago, Jim and Brandy Brow sold their three-bedroom house in southern Vermont, bought five wooded acres nearby and moved in with Brandy's father while Jim set about building a new seven-bedroom home. Living with Dad got difficult, so the Brows purchased a 1978 trailer, had it hauled to their land and moved in. Money and building supplies soon ran out, and today Jim, 33, a roofer; Brandy, 34, a writer; and their kids -- Isaac, 12; Chanyn, 10; Solomon, 8; Noah, 5; Elijah, 4; and Natasha, 1 -- share 832 square feet. ''I hated this trailer,'' says Brandy, who walked us through the family's life there. ''But it has given us benefits. We've grown close. I hope our relationships are solid enough that we will choose to be together when we have space.'' BUGGED OUT ''The trailer sits on blocks. In the summer it's hot; in the winter supercold. Last winter we put hay around the base, and it wasn't so cold. Until summer, when we had mites crawling around. They were living in the hay. The hay had to go.'' BUNK BEDLAM ''This room is a new addition to the trailer. We built it this winter. It's about 8 feet by 14 feet. The bunk beds are built into the wall. The boys sleep in this room, all four of them. This is the first time they have had a space of their own, so it's a big deal for them. Prior to this, the boys slept on fold-out foam beds on the living-room floor. They kind of slept on top of each other. Every night we'd have to take out the beds and fold them up each morning. It was like a sleepover party every night. Now and then we had to separate them by telling one of them to go and sleep under the kitchen table. They didn't like that, and it quieted them down. The dresser next to the bunk beds used to be stacked on top of the dresser in my bedroom. Once it fell over and nearly killed Noah. Jim caught it and saved him.'' CLOSET CASE ''A big issue is finding a place to put shoes and coats. As bad as the coats are for taking up space, the worst is the shoes. They end up blocking the front door. We have a shoe rack, but it can only hold so much. That white thing under the coats is actually a freezer. The fridge in the kitchen is too small for us. Just bread for the week doesn't fit inside it.'' FEEDING FRENZY ''We eat the main meal at lunch and a light meal at dinner. It's healthier and cuts down on how many people I have underfoot during the big meal, because we have four children in public school, and they eat breakfast and lunch there. We were given this big table, which means we can seat all eight people at once. The biggest challenge is trying to fit everyone in and move around to serve. Most of the time, my husband will eat on his recliner in front of the television because it's quieter there. I have to use the table as a kitchen countertop, because there isn't enough work space. So I have to maneuver between table, stove and sink, which isn't easy. We use stools in the dining room, because chairs with backs take up too much space. The stools can be stacked and put out of the way.'' CHORE SCOREBOARD ''This is the chore board and the behavior ladder. The chore board is based on a dartboard, with symbols for different chores in each space. Each child has a colored peg, and this is used to assign him a different chore each day. I instituted this because the kids were becoming resistant to being told what to do. This puts the chores on them. That's where the ladder comes in. It has eight levels. On the highest level you get your weekly allowance and can go over to friends' houses overnight. The lowest level means you are grounded, with extra chores and no allowance. Depending on your behavior and how well you complete your chores, you are sent up or down the ladder. Some of my children have a harder time with the system than others, but we give them all mercy. At the beginning of each month, on birthdays and holidays, everyone gets reset to the highest level.'' ALL WASHED UP ''We have the younger kids up on the sink, because everyone can't get to the sink at the same time without that. Why they don't take turns I really don't know. Part of it is they like to hold each other accountable as to who did the best job brushing. In general, we use the bathroom in shifts. Jim and I usually shower during the day. The children shower in the evenings. Half of them shower one day and half the next. The bathroom is constantly occupied, so you get in when you can, and you have to hurry. I tell them if they really need to go, they can use the woods.''"

''Unfortunately, we were unable to come to an amicable resolution, so now we seek the benefit of the courts to determine what's best for our daughter,'' he said. ''It's an all too human set of circumstances.''"

2007-03-19T00:00:00Z,"Senate Republicans, meanwhile, are rejecting a proposal by the governor to create a state false-claims act for health care fraud, which encourages employees to blow the whistle on malfeasance. The Senate argues in its budget report that such an act ''would be redundant and unnecessary'' because there is already a federal False Claims Act that allows the state to share in half of all fraud recoveries. But recent federal legislation adds an incentive for states that have their own false claims acts, increasing their share of recoveries to 60 percent from 50 percent -- a difference that can amount to tens of millions of dollars. The provision was inserted into legislation by Senator Charles E. Grassley, above, an Iowa Republican, who has been a champion of false claims acts."

Not easy for the Tar Heels because of U.S.C.'s defense and experience. Look for a close game, but the Heels are too deep. No. 6 Vanderbilt vs. No. 2 Georgetown Vanderbilt abandoned a Princeton-style offense (which the Hoyas use) and has had success. But the Hoyas have too much. SHINING STAR NICK YOUNG, a 6-foot-6 junior forward from Los Angeles, scored a team-high 22 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in U.S.C.'s upset victory over Texas. Young also scored 20 points in the Trojans' victory over Arkansas in the first round. MIDWEST Florida probably just played its toughest game until it reaches Atlanta.

No. 3 Texas A&M vs. No. 2 Memphis The Aggies have the athleticism to stay with Memphis. They'll also have many fans in San Antonio to lift them. SHINING STAR The sophomore guard Antonio Anderson scored 14 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in Memphis's victory over Nevada. He scored on a backdoor layup to seal the win and had a key save of an inbounds pass.

When the Republican-led State Senate called last week for spending more in next year's budget than did the Democratic governor, Eliot Spitzer, or the Democratic-led State Assembly, newspapers around the state marveled at what one called a political ''Freaky Friday'' and another termed ''Bizarro world,'' a nod to the alternate, topsy-turvy universe of Superman and ''Seinfeld'' fame. That through-the-looking glass quality was only heightened when Michael R. Long, the chairman of the state's Conservative Party, wrote a letter to Governor Spitzer in support of his budget, saying, ''as difficult as your budget is, what the Republican-controlled Senate is proposing forces me to re-evaluate your proposals.''"

He rejected Curt Flood's plea to overturn his trade from the Cardinals to the Phillies. He suspended George Steinbrenner, Ted Turner and Denny McLain. He barred Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays for promoting casino gambling. But none of those decisions by Kuhn, who died Thursday at 80, altered the game on the field, at least in the A.L. East, as much as his 1976 voiding of the stunning sales at the June 15 trading deadline by Charles O. Finley, the Oakland Athletics' obstreperous owner, of three players he deemed too expensive to re-sign: the ace left-hander Vida Blue to the Yankees for $1.5 million, and the future Hall of Fame reliever Rollie Fingers and outfielder Joe Rudi to the Red Sox for $1 million each."

2007-03-20T00:00:00Z,"The speaker of the Louisiana House said he would support a bill outlawing cockfighting if it were to take effect two or three years from now, to give people in the industry time to adjust. Speaker Joe R. Salter, who once opposed a ban, said his decision was partly influenced by last week&#8217;s passage of a cockfighting ban in New Mexico, which had been the only state other than Louisiana where the practice was legal. A House bill backed by Mr. Salter would impose a six-month jail term, $1,000 fines or both on people found guilty of organizing cockfights or taking part in them. It would take effect in 2010."

The charges against the businessman, Mark Anderson, include arson, tax evasion, mail fraud, using a fake name and interstate transportation of fraudulently obtained property. They are the first stemming from the fire, which burned the Wines Central warehouse on Mare Island, a former naval base in Vallejo, about 30 miles northeast of San Francisco. It destroyed the inventories of more than 80 vintners, worth about $100 million. Mr. Anderson had stored wine at the warehouse but had removed most of it after being asked to do so by business managers several months before the fire. He had been under investigation partly because he was at the warehouse when the fire erupted. The federal public defender in Sacramento, Matthew C. Bockmon, declined to comment on the case."

The Catawbas had argued that a 1993 land deal with the state allowed them to use video poker machines, which were outlawed statewide in 2000, on their reservation. The state contended that the land deal meant that the tribe&#8217;s reservation fell under state, not federal, gambling laws. State Attorney General Henry McMaster said the court had made &#8220;a sound decision.&#8221; A lawyer for the Catawbas, Jay Bender, called the ruling a setback but said the tribe would appeal to the federal courts."

The left-leaning New Democrat Party has said that the current rush to develop the oil sands makes special tax concessions unnecessary."

CBS's live coverage carried over deep into the 7 p.m. hour, pushing back the network's prime-time lineup of ''60 Minutes,'' ''Amazing Race,'' ''Cold Case'' and ''Without a Trace'' by roughly 45 minutes. The overrun made Nielsen's preliminary estimates for the individual CBS shows unreliable; but CBS's overall dominance was conclusive. In second place ABC and NBC fared about evenly well. ABC's lineup of repeats, led by ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' at 8 (10.6 million), posted a slight advantage among adults 18 to 49, while NBC edged ahead in total viewers, buoyed by ''Deal or No Deal'' at 9 (12 million). Meanwhile NBC's ''Grease: You're the One That I Want'' earned a distant fourth place finish at 8 in the 18 to 49 demographic and 6.6 million total viewers.

My own feelings about the collection were mixed, though they did not include disappointment. I think Browne fulfilled his mission to give Brooks something different without completely overturning the traditions of the 189-year-old company. Admittedly, the fit and proportion of the clothes (more Browne than Brooks), the solemn stiffness of the tweeds, the muscular legs in knee socks and the odd bespectacled model induced, at times, a thought of Austin Powers. Still, the overcoats and blazers were eye-catching and different, and I can imagine a woman having a good old time with the men's capes and tweed plus fours, pinching the elements that would look sexy and fun for her. A woman with a very subjective sense of style (and a slim, hipless figure) will know what to do with a small-fitting wool pantsuit, its trousers cropped, embroidered with the Brooks fleece logo.

2007-03-21T00:00:00Z,"Thatcher Drama-Documentary Planned After the success of ''The Queen,'' moviegoers can look forward to the prime minister. BBC Films and Pathé Productions are developing a drama-documentary film about Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 17 days leading to the Falklands War against Argentina in 1982, the BBC reported. ''The proposed film will be a revealing and intimate portrait of Margaret Thatcher as she battles to save her career in the 17 days immediately preceding the war,'' Pathé said in a statement. ''The 17-day period is relevant because it was the duration of the British fleet's voyage to the Falklands. During that period, Thatcher had to confront her private fears, face down the men who doubted her and forge the image that even today casts a shadow across the political landscape.'' Ms. Thatcher, sometimes called the Iron Lady, was prime minister from 1979 to 1990. Last month, Helen Mirren won the Academy Award for best actress for ''The Queen,'' portraying Elizabeth II in the days after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Mezzo-Soprano and Quartet Win Segal Awards The mezzo-soprano Kate Lindsey, below, and the Daedalus Quartet, right, were awarded $5,000 each yesterday as winners of the 2007 Martin E. Segal Awards at a luncheon at the Stanley H. Kaplan Penthouse at Lincoln Center. The awards, established by the center's board when Mr. Segal retired as Lincoln Center chairman in 1986, are given annually to two rising young artists in recognition of outstanding achievement. The nominees are chosen on a rotating basis by two of Lincoln Center's 12 resident arts constituents. Ms. Lindsey is in her third and final year in the Metropolitan Opera's Lindemann Young Artist Development Program. Founded in 2000, the Daedalus Quartet is made up of the brother-and-sister violinists Kyu-Young Kim and Min-Young Kim, the violist Jessica Thompson and the cellist Raman Ramakrishnan. The quartet is in the final year of its three-season residency in the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center's Chamber Music Society Two program. Horror Film Ads Prompt Outrage ''Captivity,'' a horror film starring Elisha Cuthbert, below, as a woman abducted, held captive and tortured, hasn't opened yet, but its ads -- on 1,400 New York City taxis and on 30 billboards in the Los Angeles area -- have offended so many people that the producer said they would be withdrawn, Reuters reported. The complaints, via e-mail messages and telephone calls, were prompted by four images, each with a caption: ''Abduction'' showed Ms. Cuthbert with a gloved hand across her face; ''Confinement'' showed her behind a chain-link fence with a bloody finger poking through; ''Torture'' showed her face covered in white gauze, tubes up her nose; and ''Termination'' showed her, head thrown back, seemingly dead. Lionsgate Films, the distributor, said the ads were handled by its partner, After Dark Films, and that it had no involvement with them. After Dark said the billboards were posted without its approval. The Motion Picture Association of America declined immediate comment pending a decision about the matter. ''Captivity,'' directed by Roland Joffé, whose credits include ''The Killing Fields'' and ''The Scarlet Letter,'' is to open on May 18. Who's Watching? The typical American home received 104 television channels last year, The Associated Press reported, citing Nielsen Media Research. In 2000, the number was 61, and in 1990 it was 33. But Nielsen reported that last year viewers watched only 15 percent of the available channels for any appreciable length of time.

Dedicated to the work of what the festival terms ''new or emerging'' filmmakers, New Directors/New Films has served as an early stopping point for former up-and-comers from Chantal Akerman to Spike Lee and Wong Kar-wai and many more filmmakers who faded from view or never finished emerging. Whether because of the state of the world, the states of mind of the festival's half-dozen programmers or those of the filmmakers, this year's slate of 26 features -- some of which have yet to secure American distribution -- and miscellaneous shorts seems to mete out a greater abundance than usual of sorrows from around the globe. Some of these offerings feel as exploitative as anything produced by Hollywood at its most craven; a few veer close to unhappy art-house self-parody."

But the reds we tasted from Navarre suggested that they could easily suit this purpose, too. Several of them were jammy, with suggestions of rich cooked fruit, spices and earthy tannins on the palate. I also picked up hints of prune in more than one of these wines. And many of them are around $10, making them perfect for poaching prunes to serve at the end of a simple, rustic dinner of grilled flank steak with blistered red peppers and roasted potatoes."

The origins of both are undoubtedly the same: yet another way to make good use of bread that's no longer fresh. Though torrijas, like French toast, can be served at breakfast, they can also be a knockout dessert. In fairness, the French take their pain perdu more seriously than we take French toast, generally making it sweeter and more bread-pudding-like. But nothing prepared me for my first bite of torrijas. They are pretty much over the top: bread drenched in milk (I've had them made with cream, too), sugar and eggs, and then fried, seriously fried, in olive oil."

Speaker Sheldon Silver and the members of the New York State Assembly offer our sympathy and our prayers to the Zebrowski family, to Assembly Member Ken Zebrowski's many friends, and to the citizens of New City, Haverstraw, and all of Rockland County. From the moment he was elected to the county legislature in 1973, Ken Zebrowski served the communities of his beloved Rockland County with dedication and joy. Elected to the Assembly in 2004, Ken Zebrowski was known for the profound respect he held for the law, and for his unshakable faith in the legislative branch of government. Throughout his service, Ken was guided by three simple and oft-stated maxims: The Legislature is the people's best window for immediate access to their government. Legislation offers the most direct and effective response to my constituents' concerns and problems. The needs of every Rockland County resident are my concern. In the State Capitol, Ken Zebrowski was admired for his leadership and integrity, his wisdom and wit, his compassion and most of all, his generous spirit. Ken was a valued member of several Assembly committees. He was committed to improving public education, reforming the state's healthcare system, protecting the elderly, and assisting those communities hurt by the Mirant Utility Company bankruptcy and assessment challenge. It was an honor to serve with him and a privilege to know him both as a friend and as a colleague. We will miss him dearly. Sheldon Silver Speaker of the NYS Assembly"

Ms. Spears, 25, checked out of the Promises Malibu Alcohol and Drug Rehab Treatment Facility ''after successfully completing their program,'' her manager, Larry Rudolph, said in a statement released by Jive Records late on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Rudolph asked that Ms. Spears's privacy be respected. She entered the center on Feb. 22 after a well-documented spasm of bizarre behavior that included shaving her head, being tattooed and hammering a car with an umbrella. Those actions followed a year when she mishandled her babies; parted from her club-hopping husband, Kevin Federline; and appeared in public without underpants. Under a temporary agreement, Ms. Spears and Mr. Federline have joint custody of their sons, Jayden James, 6 months, and Sean Preston, 18 months. Woody Harrelson's Father Dies in Prison Woody Harrelson's father, Charles Harrelson, 68, has died in the high-security federal prison in Florence, Colo., where he was serving two life sentences for the murder of a federal judge, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Mr. Harrelson, who appeared to have died of natural causes, was found unresponsive in his cell on March 15, according to Felicia Ponce, a Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman in Washington. He was convicted of murder in the slaying of United States District Judge John Wood Jr. outside his home in San Antonio on May 29, 1979. Prosecutors said a drug dealer hired Mr. Harrelson to carry out the killing to prevent the judge from presiding at the dealer's impending trial. Mr. Harrelson denied involvement, saying he was in Dallas, 270 miles away, when the slaying took place.

Opera Star Wins Her Case The soprano Kiri Te Kanawa yesterday won a lawsuit featuring underwear, but her declared sensitivity to airborne panties could cost her $102,000. Ms. Te Kanawa, below, was sued in New South Wales Supreme Court in Australia for as much as $1.5 million after she canceled appearances with the 57-year-old Australian pop star John Farnham (known as the Voice) upon discovering that his performances prompted women to toss their underwear at him. ''How could I, in my classical form, perform in this way?'' Ms. Te Kanawa, 63, asked the court in February. In its decision yesterday, the court dismissed the lawsuit brought against her by the concert promotion company, Leading Edge. Although Judge Patricia Bergin ruled that no binding contract existed when Ms. Te Kanawa withdrew from the concerts, planned for Australia and New Zealand, she ordered her company, Mittane, to pay $102,000 to Leading Edge for costs. The judge said Mittane was not truthful to Leading Edge about her reasons for withdrawing, adding that the underwear was not the chief reason for the soprano's withdrawal. She said Ms. Te Kanawa had become ''extremely resentful'' that Mr. Farnham had not attended a planned meeting with her.

Tuesday night was no different, as the 11 remaining contestants performed, and Sanjaya Malakar won atypical praise from the judges. The two-hour show garnered 29.4 million viewers from 8 to 10, according to Nielsen's estimates, a decline of about 6 percent from the same night in 2006. Some of the year-to-year decline, a trend that has persisted for several weeks, can be attributed to this year's early change to daylight saving time, which reduces television audiences over all. The decrease is so small that it has not kept Fox from dominating Tuesday nights, as it did again this week. CBS was No. 2 for the night, as both ''NCIS'' at 8 (15.5 million) and ''The Unit'' at 9 (12 million) ranked second in their time slots.

While not mentioning the film, about the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C., by name, he accused Western powers of ''trying to tamper with history by making a film and by making Iran's image look savage.''

The 19-year-old singer from Savannah, Ga., received the fewest of the approximately 30 million votes cast after Tuesday's performances. The half-hour ''American Idol'' results show at 9 p.m. drew 26.3 million viewers, according to Nielsen estimates, about 1.4 million fewer than the same night a year ago. Among adults 18 to 49, the episode marked the 13th consecutive broadcast of ''American Idol'' that has fallen short in the ratings from year-to-year. Fox remained the night's leader over all, as a 9:30 episode of '' 'Til Death'' (14.6 million) helped the network round out the 9 p.m. hour on top. At 8, however, Fox's ''Bones'' (10.3 million) ranked second behind a special edition of CBS's ''Survivor: Fiji'' (12.7 million). CBS was No. 2 for the night behind Fox. ABC finished third, as ''Lost'' at 10 (12 million) earned its lowest ratings ever among adults 18 to 49.

2007-03-23T00:00:00Z,"Some jazz record labels are fortunate enough to catch the spirit of a moment. Blue Note chronicled the arrival of hard bop in the 1950s; in the '60s it housed both soul jazz and the avant-garde. These days it's harder to say what's happening where, but a few labels do project the current dimensions of a style, or at least a scene. Cryptogramophone is one of these. Formed nine years ago in Los Angeles by the violinist Jeff Gauthier, the label demonstrates a preference for improvised music that's open-ended yet compositional, and usually string-instrument-based. It isn't really free jazz, though free-form playing is involved, and it's not fusion, though it's unimaginable without the precedent of Miles Davis's ''Bitches Brew.'' If that sounds like an indistinct definition for a subgenre, so much the better: one clear principle of Cryptogramophone is an aversion to definitions. But a recognizable aesthetic should prevail during Cryptonights, next week's festival of label-affiliated bands. Mr. Gauthier leads the charge on Monday night with his Goatette, featuring the guitarist Nels Cline and his brother, the drummer Alex Cline. Then the drummer Scott Amendola, above, presents a group with Nels Cline, the bassist John Shifflett and the violinist Jenny Scheinman. On Wednesday the pianist Myra Melford leads the scintillating quintet she calls Be Bread. And in a two-night run that starts on Thursday, Nels Cline revisits music from ''New Monastery,'' his fine recent tribute to the pianist Andrew Hill. (As it happens, Mr. Hill himself will perform elsewhere on Thursday afternoon; see jazz listings, below.) The festivities run through next weekend, when Cryptonights features the multireedist Benny Maupin, whose connection to the label goes further than a recent release: many years ago he took part in the sessions that yielded ''Bitches Brew.'' (Monday through April 1 at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25.) NATE CHINEN"

2007-03-23T00:00:00Z,"The architect Renzo Piano has withdrawn from a project to build an 80-story tower in Boston that would have involved the demolition of a 1960 building by Paul Rudolph, left, that is valued by preservationists, a spokeswoman for Mr. Piano said yesterday. The spokeswoman declined to give a reason for the architect's decision, but Mr. Piano said earlier this month that he was resisting pressure from the project's developer, Steven Belkin, to increase the width of the building. Mr. Piano also said at the time that if his project were to proceed, the 13-story Rudolph structure, also known as the Blue Cross/Blue Shield building, would have to be removed to make room for a plaza. Preservationists are battling to save the Rudolph building, whose somewhat ornate exterior ran counter to the then-prevailing Modernist preference for unornamented exterior glass walls. The Boston Landmarks Commission imposed a 90-day delay in the demolition of the Rudolph building on March 13, but Mr. Belkin said that the Boston firm CBT Architects intended to ''implement Piano's design, making appropriate refinements as needed during the design review process.''

In partnership with the U.K.'s Chesterfield Properties, Plc he founded Chesterfield Ronson Europe, Limited, and became one of the first pan-European commercial developers active across France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, and the U.K. In the late 1970's, Mr. Ronsons keen eye for market opportunity took him to the United States where he started HRO International, Limited and quickly established himself among the most active and successful developers in New York City. During the following decade he built 11 large projects totaling over 550,000 m2. Seeing similar market opportunity in Europe in the mid 1990's, Mr. Ronson re-established HRO's presence in Paris bringing with him its well established high-tech capabilities. Again, demonstrating extraordinary market timing, HRO went on to develop 19 major projects, creating what are generally viewed as Europe's leading buildings in Paris, London and Frankfurt. The HRO Group is one of the leading privately held international commercial real estate development firms and a major force in both the European and American markets, having developed more than 1.5 million m2 of prime office property in 55 projects over the past four decades. The firm includes 30 partners and professional staff in Paris and New York, and will continue operating as it has, with the Ronson family. Mr. Ronson is known as a driven and intensely dedicated individual, who strove for excellence and professionalism. He earned numerous international industry awards for design, management and development excellence. Everyone who met him was drawn to his warm and clearly brilliant mind. Mr. Ronson's energy also extended to exceptional philanthropic endeavors. Envisioning the need for a top quality religious educational institution (Yeshiva) in the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem corridor, he conceived, built and nurtured the Genesis Center, a campus serving 150 Jewish students. He recently initiated construction of a new synagogue (Yakar) in Tel Aviv. Mr. Ronson is survived by his wife Angelika, their twin daughters Gisele and Livia, his stepson Stanley, his sister Benita, nieces Tanya and Ali, and nephew Oliver. A memorial service shall be held at the Millennium Hotel, in Grosvenor Square, London at 2 pm on Sunday March 25, 2007 followed by a burial service at 4 pm. In lieu of flowers or gifts donations may be made in Mr. Ronson's memory to a charity of choice. $(6$)RONSON--Howard.

2007-03-23T00:00:00Z,"Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema said he did not discuss with American officials the deal in which five Taliban prisoners were traded this week for the freedom of a kidnapped Italian reporter in Afghanistan. Despite strong criticism from officials in the United States and Europe, Mr. D'Alema told reporters in Rome, ''I am not the slightest bit repentant for having saved'' the reporter, Daniele Mastrogiacomo, adding that it ''is preferable to have a controversy over having saved him, rather than for having had him killed.''

2007-03-23T00:00:00Z,"An obituary yesterday about G. E. Patterson, the presiding bishop of the Church of God in Christ, misstated the relationship of some of his survivors. Mary Hawkins and Lee Ella Smith, both of Memphis, and Barbara Davis of Detroit are his sisters, not his daughters. The obituary also gave an incorrect spelling in some copies for the name of the magazine of which he was editor and publisher. It is Bountiful Blessings Magazine, not Bountiful Blessing Magazine."
2007-03-23T00:00:00Z,"The marvelously zany installation artist Devorah Sperber recreates classics with a pizazz that breathes new life into familiar, even hackneyed images. Her latest exhibition, installed in a roomy mezzanine gallery at the Brooklyn Museum, applies this formula to paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso and Jan van Eyck, among others. This time the images are remade using thousands of spools of colored thread arranged in seemingly abstract patterns that suddenly pull into focus when viewed through a circular device resembling a crystal ball. There is a reproduction of Picasso's portrait of Gertrude Stein dressed in a suit and looking much like a man, made using 5,024 spools of thread, and a life-size re-creation of Leonardo's ''Last Supper'' made from 20,736 spools of thread. (Above, ''After the Mona Lisa 1,'' 2005). These works boggle the mind and entrance; they might even make you say ''wow.'' As much about art as about optics, they are hung upside down to account for the way the optical device, like the human eye, inverts imagery. From a few feet away, they look like fields of vague, pixilated color. But through the optical device, you see a perfect reproduction of the paintings. It's like magic.

2007-03-23T00:00:00Z,"It's hard enough to teach little humans to sit still, follow directions and calmly accept vaccinations; how difficult is it when those who are learning are even wilder types, like Stella, Beebe and Alexis? They're sea lions at the Prospect Park Zoo in Brooklyn, and with fellow residents -- meerkats, cotton-top tamarins and alpacas -- they're among the stars of Keeping Up With Keepers Weekend. The other stars, of course, are zookeepers. ''It's everything you've always wanted to know about being a zookeeper but were afraid to ask,'' said Patricia Cole, the zoo's assistant director and curator of animals. Tomorrow and Sunday the staff members will demonstrate training techniques and present their furry charges with enrichment: treats that stimulate intelligence by requiring ingenuity. At 11 a.m. the meerkats will go after grubs concealed in paper bags. (Yum.) At 2:30 p.m. the tamarins, a type of monkey, will receive cricket rocks, stones drilled with holes and filled with insects. ''They're like time-release cricket cookies,'' Ms. Cole said. The training, while fun to watch, is not solely entertainment. The object of teaching ''targeting'' (following a stick with a rubber ball at the end) and ''stationing'' (remaining on a colored tile), is to make the animals easier to transport and examine. The meerkats are trained to go into crates, while the tamarins learn to step onto scales. At 3 p.m. visitors will see how alpacas (the zoo's are Pukara, left, and Loki) get used to halters. And at 11:45 a.m. and 2 and 4 p.m., the sea lions go through their paces. ''Every sea lion gets its mouth and eyes looked at daily,'' Ms. Cole said, ''and we'll ask them to show us their flippers.'' Teaching them to take shots is dicier. ''You go through many days of poking them with your finger,'' she explained. Children at the event can also go on scavenger hunts, see puppet shows, make crafts and even feed and pet Pukara and Loki. ''They're very cute,'' Ms. Cole said. ''Except when they spit.'' (Tomorrow and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m, 450 Flatbush Avenue, Prospect Park, Brooklyn, 718-399-7339, prospectparkzoo.com. Free with admission: $6; $2.25 for 65+; $2 for 3 to 12; free for under 3.)

Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'BLINDNESS' Joe Tantalo's adaptation of José Saramago's best-selling novel, about an unnamed city struck with an inexplicable epidemic of ''white blindness,'' is set in a cell-like space surrounded by white scrim. This setting and the mostly strong acting drive home the fearful basic circumstances. Unfortunately, the script also streamlines Mr. Saramago's reflective story to the point of draining it of moral complexity (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jonathan Kalb) 'THE CAVE DWELLERS' This revival of William Saroyan's 1957 play about a group of misfits inhabiting an abandoned theater examines the virtue of charity and the nobility of failure but feels as stifling and constricted as the building in which the outcasts find themselves. A production that asks us to revere the theater without inviting reverence itself (1:30). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) 'CHICKEN' Michael Batistick's new play about cock fighting and emasculation could benefit from subtler metaphors but manages to touch us gently even as it deploys a heavy hammer. E J Carroll, Michael Imperioli and his ''Sopranos'' castmate Sharon Angela give fine performances as struggling urban nobodies (1:45). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Bellafante) (1:45) 'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE DIRECTOR' A likable if naïve young woman, who is seduced by an unnamed, unseen and presumably unscrupulous film director, seeks other of his victims and tape records their experiences for no clear purpose in a play that has no clear idea of what it wants to say (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet, transfixing production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic. (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. (2:05). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) * 'JACK GOES BOATING' Bob Glaudini's gentle comedy about pothead losers in love is a reminder of how engrossing uneventful lives can be in the hands of the right actors. Peter DuBois directs the easygoing ensemble, brilliantly led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley) * 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Isherwood) 'LOS ANGELES' Julian Sheppard's play about a gamin lost in a Hollywood of aimlessness and empty sex is as thin as the slip dress she keeps wearing and, presumably, taking off (1:20). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante) 'MY TRIP TO AL-QAEDA' Lawrence Wright, author of a deeply researched book about the rise of Islamic terrorism, conducts a theatrical seminar about the events leading to the horror of 9/11. He combines a linear narrative of the development of Al Qaeda with reminiscences about the experience of writing the book. Absorbing, and chilling too (1:30). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'TALL GRASS' Brian Harris's three short plays, black farces all, are not nearly as slight as any sound-bite synopsis would have them seem. Here Harris, a former stock analyst, explores the alliances formed between love and brutality in scenarios in which the tension builds to culminating shock (1:30). The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200 (Bellafante) * 'THE TAMING OF THE SHREW' AND 'TWELFTH NIGHT' In these boisterous and inventive productions, from the London-based all-male Propeller Company, the poetry may be pretty, but the comedy definitely is not. The director Edward Hall uncovers the baleful underbelly in Shakespearean slapstick, memorably demonstrating that boys will be brutes. (Each is 2:40.) Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. (Brantley) 'TEA AND SYMPATHY' The specter of the Ted Haggard scandal hangs over the Keen Company's revival of Robert Anderson's 1953 play about life in a psychologically stifling boys' boarding school. Girded by Jonathan Silverstein's skillful, understated direction, the play attains an unexpected timeliness as it evolves into a story about the dangers of sexual repression (2:00). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) 'THE WAITING ROOM' An amusing play about some uncomfortable truths a group of friends and relatives faces while sitting in a hospital waiting room. While it has its share of laughs, it has things to say about the importance of family, even those members you might wish were not a part of it (2:00). 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Hampton) 'WIDOWERS' HOUSES' An adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's play, updated to 1990s Harlem, tests the limits of credibility (1:40). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) Off Off Broadway 'JACKIE WITH A Z' Delectably outrageous (1:30). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'MEN OF STEEL' This darkly comic twist on super heroes is a loony guilty pleasure (2:00). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman) 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' A joyful treat (1:30). JCC in Manhattan, Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Van Gelder) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE ATTIC' The playwright Yoji Sakate looks at hikikomori, the Japanese phenomenon in which teenagers retreat from society, isolating themselves for weeks, months and sometimes even years. With a deft ensemble cast, the results are illuminating, original and darkly funny. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 'BAAL' The director Charmian Creagle's bright idea for staging Bertolt Brecht's often offensive first play -- about a poet and singer who is a monster of appetite -- was to cast the title role as a woman. The production is so poorly acted and drearily directed, however, that the casting does nothing to illuminate the play or open a meaningful inquiry into habitual reactions to it (2:15). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 307-9467; closes on Sunday. (Kalb) 'KING LEAR' Or ''Lear Lite,'' featuring New Age music; eye-soothing, color-coordinated costumes; and the charming Kevin Kline in the title role. Directed by James Lapine, this is a whimsical story-book production that feels perversely out of touch with the soul-wrenching depths of Shakespeare's most devastating tragedy (3:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE MADRAS HOUSE' A century-old drama about ''the woman question,'' this rare revival of Harley Granville Barker's fascinating play is more contemporary than you might think (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'MARY ROSE' J. M. Barrie wrote this distaff variation on themes from ''Peter Pan'' in 1920, and it has mostly lain on the shelf since. A young English girl (an exuberant Paige Howard) acquires the odd habit of disappearing and reappearing some time later, untouched by time's passing. Gentle and melancholy, handsomely mounted by Tina Landau, ''Mary Rose'' is nonetheless itself touched by the mark of time (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'MOBY DICK -- REHEARSED' A gripping revival of Orson Welles's 1955 adaptation of Melville's classic (2:00). Richmond Shepard Theater, 309 East 26th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'PARTICULARLY IN THE HEARTLAND' You can almost feel the self-congratulation in the hearts and minds of the writers and performers of this surrealist ensemble piece as they try to understand how the Red states think and live. The results? A well-intentioned mess of emoting over the current political divides (1:30). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101); closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AMAZING GRACE' (PG, 120 minutes) Michael Apted's prettified take on the life and times of the 18th-century reformer William Wilberforce carries a strong whiff of piety but is generally pleasing and often moving, and features fine performances from newcomers and veterans alike. (Manohla Dargis) * 'BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON' (R, 92 minutes) Scott Glosserman's mockumentary about a celebrity-seeking serial killer is sustained by rapier-sharp observations and a firmer grasp of tone than that in many more generously financed projects. Appealing more to the brain than the gut, the movie subtly prods at the sick dance between the news media and über-criminals without belaboring its point or lowering its tone. If Christopher Guest ever turned his attention to psycho killers instead of folk singers and dog breeders, this is exactly the sort of movie he would make. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'BLACK SNAKE MOAN' (R, 116 minutes) Christina Ricci as a Tennessee nymphomaniac and Samuel Jackson as the blues singer who tries to cure her by fastening her half-naked self to his radiator with a chain. In spite of that summary, it's mostly corny uplift, from Craig Brewer, who also wrote and directed the down-home pimp fairy tale ''Hustle & Flow.'' (A.O. Scott) 'BLOCKADE' and 'AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER' (No rating, 78 minutes total running time) Two short movies assembled from archival material explore the siege of Leningrad and the eastern front during World War II. (Stephen Holden) 'BREACH' (PG-13, 110 minutes) In his fine, no-nonsense account of the capture of the F.B.I. agent-turned-mole Robert Philip Hanssen, the director Billy Ray manages to excite and unnerve despite our knowing the ending. Chris Cooper and Ryan Phillippe star. (Dargis) * 'BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA' (PG, 95 minutes) Grounded more in reality than in fantasy, this adaptation of Katherine Paterson's novel offers an affecting story of a transformative friendship between two gifted children. Beautifully capturing a time when a bully in school can loom as large as a troll in a nightmare, the director, Gabor Csupo, keeps the fantasy in the background to find magic in the everyday. (Catsoulis) 'A JOURNEY OF DMITRY SHOSTAKOVICH' (No rating, 75 minutes) A documentary grab bag of film clips, diary readings and desultory narration, ''A Journey of Dmitry Shostakovich'' peeks at the politics of this controversial composer through a flurry of archival curiosities. But in their struggle to portray a man compromising his art to save his life, the directors, Oksana Dvornichenko and Helga Landauer, adopt a scattershot approach that's ultimately as ambiguous and impenetrable as its subject. (Catsoulis) 'DEAD SILENCE' (R, 90 minutes) In this new film from the makers of the ''Saw'' series, a young man (Ryan Kwanten) whose wife was murdered by a demonic ventriloquist's dummy returns to his hometown to unravel the roots of a century-old curse. The film's playfully self-aware touches (like a grand old theater named the Guignol) distract from its leaden pacing, three too many final twists and various behavioral idiocies. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'EXTERMINATING ANGELS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in French) The French director Jean-Claude Brisseau's film is a piece of highbrow smut about a French filmmaker directing a piece of highbrow smut. A must for fans of highbrow smut. No complaints here. (Scott) * 'THE HOST' (R, 119 minutes, in Korean) A loopy, feverishly imaginative genre hybrid -- part carnival of horrors, part family melodrama -- about the demons that haunt us from without and within. The talented South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho directs his monster and humans with equal flair. (Dargis) 'I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE' (R, 94 minutes) An unusually smart and brisk comedy of marital frustration and sexual temptation, based on Eric Rohmer's ''Chloe in the Afternoon,'' with Chris Rock (who directed and is co-author of the script) as a Manhattan investment banker distracted by the charms of a bombshell played by the wonderful Kerry Washington. (Scott) * 'INTO GREAT SILENCE' (No rating, 162 minutes, in English and Latin) Philip Gröning's documentary about the lives of Carthusian monks living in a valley in the French Alps is slow, quiet and utterly spellbinding for the way it conveys the experience of spiritual devotion in simple, lovely images. (Scott) 'MUSIC AND LYRICS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant phone in passable impersonations of themselves in this competent romantic comedy, which is somewhat enlivened by parodies of bad pop songs from both the 1980s and the present. (Scott) 'NORBIT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Eddie Murphy plays a nebbish, a fat woman and a Chinese restaurant owner in this crude, sometimes mean, but often funny farce. (Scott) 'THE NAMESAKE' (PG-13, 122 minutes) Color is the stuff of life in the movies of Mira Nair, the Indian-born director whose newest film, adapted from Jhumpa Lahiri's popular novel, follows two generations of a Bengali family from late-1970s Calcutta to New York City. Her lush palette lends her films a throbbing physicality that invites you to step into the screen and embrace the sensuous here and now. (Holden) NOMAD: THE WARRIOR' (R, 111 minutes) This epic adventure film from Kazakhstan is about attempts to unify that country in the 18th century, but it sure does look like an old-fashioned American western. A reasonably good western, all things considered, despite a formulaic plot and a high cliché count in the dialogue. Horses, horses, horses, dazzlingly handled. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE NUMBER 23' (R, 95 minutes) An accidental comedy starring a deadly serious Jim Carrey that owes something to David Fincher, a little something else to Robert Anton Wilson and next to nothing, at least intentionally, to the gods of laughter, be they Gelus (Greek) or Jerry Lewis (American). (Dargis) 'PREMONITION' (PG-13, 97 minutes) This sloppy, absent-minded psychological thriller scrambles time in the life of a desperate housewife (Sandra Bullock) whose husband is dead one day, alive the next. (Holden) 'STARTER FOR TEN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) This amiable, nostalgic British comedy tackles a lofty subject -- the allure of knowledge --with down-to-earth charm, following a working-class kid (James McAvoy) during his first year at Bristol University and an appearance on the TV quiz show ''University Challenge.'' But beneath the formulaic embarrassments and fumbled learning curve lurks a more somber theme: the inevitable rupture between those who pursue an education and those left behind. (Catsoulis) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) 'WILD HOGS' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Tame slop. (Scott) * 'THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY' (No rating, 127 minutes) Stringent, serious history from Ken Loach, in which the Irish uprising and Civil War of the early 1920s test the loyalties and consciences of two brothers, played by Cillian Murphy and Padraic Delany. (Scott) * 'ZODIAC' (R, 158 minutes) David Fincher's magnificently obsessive new film tracks the story of the serial killer who left dead bodies up and down California in the 1960s and possibly the '70s, and that of the men who tried to stop him. Set when the Age of Aquarius disappeared into the black hole of the Manson family murders, ''Zodiac'' is part police procedural, part monster movie, a funereal entertainment that is a testament to this cinematic savant's gifts. (Dargis) Film Series FASHION IN FILM FESTIVAL (Tomorrow and Sunday) A series devoted to the art and business of fashion concludes this weekend at the Museum of the Moving Image. Tomorrow Frederick Wiseman's cinéma-verité study ''Model'' (1980) is followed by ''Assuming a Pose,'' a program of European and American newsreels that is spiced up with Kenneth Anger's ravishing avant-garde film ''Puce Moment.'' The day concludes with Elsa Kvamme's 1999 documentary, ''Lady With a Hat,'' about the Jewish hatmaker and World War II hero May Aubert. Sunday starts with a pair of fiction films from Europe -- Vera Chytilova's Czech project ''Ceiling'' (1962) and William Klein's ''Who Are You, Polly Magoo?,'' filmed in Paris in 1966 -- and then moves on to two documentaries, Bruce Weber's ''Chop Suey'' (2001) and Douglas Keeve's ''Unzipped'' (1995), and finishes up with David Byrne's 1986 phantasmagoria of American life, ''True Stories.'' Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Dave Kehr) FRENCH SEVENTIES: CINEMA AFTER MAY '68 (Tonight through Tuesday) A rich series of films influenced by the political upheavals in France in May 1968 concludes this week with three major titles. Tonight at 7 there's a rare screening of Ariane Mnouchkine's 1978 ''Molière,'' an epic, 260-minute study of the great French comic playwright as staged by one of the leading theater directors of the 1970s and starring Philippe Caubère. Tuesday brings two weighty films for the strong of heart: Jacques Rivette's 1982 ''Le Pont du Nord,'' in which a '60s radical (Bulle Ogier) is released from prison into an unrecognizable 1980s Paris, and Jean Eustache's essential 1973 work ''La Maman et la Putain'' (''The Mother and the Whore''), in which the New Wave aesthetic reaches some sort of terminal point, as Jean-Pierre Léaud, Bernadette Lafont and Françoise Lebrun discuss the intricacies of male-female relationships for 215 fascinating minutes. French Institute Alliance Française, Tinker Auditorium, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6100, fiaf.org; $9. (Kehr) VERDICT ON AUSCHWITZ: THE FRANKFURT AUSCHWITZ TRIAL 1963-1965 (Sunday and Tuesday) As their camera roams the now empty modern courtroom where the Auschwitz trial look place, the German filmmakers Rolf Bickel and Dietrich Wagner make use of audiotapes recorded during the trial to make the voices of survivors and executioners heard again. Originally a German television program in three parts, it will be shown as a continuous 180-minute screening at 4:30 p.m. on Sunday and 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Thalia Film, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, www.symphonyspace.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. CHRISTINA AGUILERA, PUSSYCAT DOLLS, DANITY KANE (Tonight) Frau Farbissina of the ''Austin Powers'' movies said it best: ''Send in the Fembots!'' Ms. Aguilera may have the most virtuosic voice of her generation of bubblegum pop stars, but as she showed with her endless melismatic protraction of James Brown's ''It's a Man's Man's Man's World'' at the Grammys last month, she can sometimes seem like a singing robot gone berserk. Her tour includes a hit burlesque girl group (the Pussycat Dolls) and an imitation hit burlesque girl group (Danity Kane). At 7:30, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $54 to $99.50. (Ben Sisario) * ALLMAN BROTHERS (Tonight, tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights) The best spring ritual on the Upper West Side is the arrival of this archetypal Southern rock band for its annual series of concerts at the Beacon Theater. This year there are 13 shows over three weeks, and in addition to the long, long guitar solos by Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks, highlights usually include lots of guest stars. At 8, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; $54.99 and $84.99 (sold out tonight, tomorrow and Thursday). (Sisario) JOE BOYD (Tuesday) As a record producer in the 1960s, Joe Boyd hopped easily from psychedelia (Pink Floyd) to rustic folk-rock (Fairport Convention, Nick Drake), and his new memoir, ''White Bicycles,'' is just as adroit, tracing a music life through jazz, blues, folk and rock with a revealing clarity. For this reading and performance at Joe's Pub, he will be joined by Geoff Muldaur and Jenni Muldaur. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) DANU (Tomorrow) Danu is an Irish traditional band that plays old-fashioned acoustic instruments, with a repertory that reaches from fierce fiddle reels to pensive ballads. Its arrangements show an ear for texture that allows for both drive and delicacy. At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 545-7536, symphonyspace.org or worldmusicinstitute.org; $27; $15 for students. (Jon Pareles) DO MAKE SAY THINK (Wednesday and Thursday) The budget alternative to South by Southwest: scan that festival's schedule and see which of the most notable bands are coming through New York on their way back from Texas. This Toronto group plays multitextured instrumentals that veer from clangy turbulence to pastoral, acoustic daydreams. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $15. Thursday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) JOHNNY DOWD (Tomorrow) Johnny Dowd applies his stoic Texas twang to songs about passion, sin and death; his band plays a version of honky-tonk that sounds as if it had been dragged through a swamp and encrusted with misfiring electronics. At 10 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500, rodeobar.com; no cover. (Pareles) ELECTRIC SIX (Tomorrow and Thursday) Electric Six looks fondly back to the early 1980s merger of rock guitars, disco beats and electro blips, with arch and gleefully overblown songs about dancing and romance, like ''Danger! High Voltage'' and ''Nuclear War'' (''on the dance floor''). With Test Your Reflex and Night Kills the Day. Tomorrow night at 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. Thursday at 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15. (Pareles) FLESHTONES (Tomorrow) Year in and year out, the Fleshtones have held on to the sound of 1960s garage-rock, with its distortion-edged guitars and hoarsely exuberant vocals. Once it sounded like punk; now it's starting to sound like diehard purism. At 8 p.m., Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, between Henry and Hicks Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069, magneticbrooklyn.com; $10. (Pareles) * ROBYN HITCHCOCK AND THE VENUS 3 (Tuesday and Wednesday) Not many pop songwriters can credibly be called surrealists. But Robyn Hitchcock, who emerged in the late 1970s with the Soft Boys, has an irrepressible jabberwocky side, and in front of an audience he is a hilarious monologuist-improviser. Here he plays with the Venus 3, featuring Peter Buck of R.E.M. and two auxiliary members of that band, Scott McCaughey and Bill Rieflin. With Johanna Kunin. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $25. (Sisario) ESSIE JAIN (Tuesday) A British singer and songwriter who lives in New York, Ms. Jain builds stark and entrancing miniatures out of a few light strums of guitar and harmonies that can be warm or ghostly. With Kelley McRae and Alice Smith. At 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario) * LIGHTNING BOLT, BARR, MARNIE STERN (Tomorrow) At first it's hard to believe that all the glorious chaos of Lightning Bolt is being made by only two people. But as the sound comes into focus, a playful give-and-take becomes clear, as the bassist Brian Gibson and the drummer and vocalist Brian Chippendale toss back and forth gigantic metal riffs and giggly high notes, creating rainbows of dissonance. Over bare stutters of piano and drums, Brendan Fowler of Barr lets loose an endlessly self-regarding logorrhea, questioning his every thought and instinct in a naked, paratactic melancholy. Marnie Stern has become indie-rock's newest guitar heroine, with a distinct kind of virtuosity, playing cascades of quick staccato notes and cathartic blasts of noise that recall both Van Halen and Sleater-Kinney. With Ecstatic Sunshine and High Places. At 9 p.m., Third Ward, 195 Morgan Avenue, at Stagg Street, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 715-4961, 3rdwardbrooklyn.org or toddpnyc.com; $10. (Sisario) * MENOMENA, FIELD MUSIC (Wednesday) Menomena, from Portland, Ore., uses a homemade computer program to help write songs, resulting in shufflings and reshufflings that keep otherwise standard indie-arty elements -- meandering piano, sensual electronics and plain, mournful vocals -- playful and fresh. Field Music, from Sunderland, England, finds a middle ground between angsty post-punk and the wistfully melodic folk-rock of ''Village Green''-era Kinks. With Land of Talk. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) RHETT MILLER (Tonight) Whether with his country-flavored bar band Old 97s or in solo heartthrob mode, Rhett Miller is an unrepentant honky-tonker with a keen gift for melody. With Keegan DeWitt. At 8, Hiro Ballroom, 371 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (866) 468-7619, hiroballroom.com; $25. (Sisario) JANE MONHEIT (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday nights) The beauty of her sultry voice performing bossa nova ballads triumphs over liabilities that include obvious shyness and rushed, perfunctory patter. At 8:45, with additional shows at 10:45 tonight, tomorrow and Thursday, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 cover at tables, $55 at the bar. (Stephen Holden) PELA, TIM FITE (Tonight) It's never easy to see a good New York rock club go down, but it's especially painful when it happens to the same place twice. In the late 1980s and early '90s, Sin-é, on St. Marks Place in the East Village, was a cozy coffeehouse frequented by singer-songwriters like Jeff Buckley and the occasional Joan Osborne or Joe Jackson; it reopened on the Lower East Side in the early '00s as a plain, friendly stage for local rock bands -- an increasingly rare opportunity in Manhattan -- but will be shutting down again next month, and some notable bands are paying their last respects. Pela calls its style ''pastoral punk,'' which means wide-open skies of bouncy, Pixiesesque basslines and sharp, sparkling guitars. Tim Fite builds songs on staticky drum-machine beats and samples of old country music, rapping wryly: ''This is not a hit song/It's not even a good song.'' At 10, 150 Attorney Street, at Stanton Street, (212) 388-0077, sin-e.com; $10. (Sisario) PONYS, BLACK LIPS (Monday) These two bands have found ways -- noisy ones, mostly -- to keep the sound of '60s garage-rock vital. The Ponys, from Chicago, evoke the endurance drones of the Stooges and Sonic Youth, while the Black Lips, from Atlanta, play a grisly version of the 13th Floor Elevators' ragged guitar jangle, sounding deliberately damaged. With Panthers. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) * PTERODACTYL, ONEIDA (Tomorrow) It may be the best New York avant-rock band of the last decade, but for good or ill, it is still possible to see Oneida in places as tiny as Tonic, and for this late-night show the band plays with Pterodactyl, a kindred spirit that has signed to Oneida's new record label, Brah. At 11 p.m., 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $5. (Sisario) ROCHES (Tonight) Maggie, Terre and Suzzy Roche have been harmonizing together in various permutations for more than 30 years, but ''Moonswept'' (429 Records), released this week, is their first album as a trio in 12 years. At 8, the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $32.50 and $37.50. (Sisario) SNOW PATROL, OK GO (Tuesday and Wednesday) Like Coldplay with a more forceful drummer, Snow Patrol, a band from Scotland made up of men mostly from Northern Ireland, joins lovesick melodrama to sharp, hummable hooks. With all the focus on OK Go's dancing skills -- its ingenious treadmill skip was the highlight of the MTV Video Music Awards last year -- not much attention has been paid to its jaunty, merely adequate Cars-like power-pop. (So expect more dancing.) At 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; sold out. (Sisario) * JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, PINK (Thursday) Mr. Timberlake is the kind of pop star who makes it all look easy. But even more endearing, the guy can truly make fun of himself: his brilliant ''Saturday Night Live'' skit with Andy Samberg, broadcast in bleeped form and uncensored on the Internet, was the equivalent of a chummy high-five with his audience. Opening the show is Pink, the spark plug who once bragged of getting the party started and now ridicules ''stupid girls'' who torture themselves for men. At 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $56 and $92. (Sisario) TK WEBB (Tomorrow) A Brooklynite by way of rural Missouri, this singer and guitarist plays ragged, stark Delta blues about desolation and dying young, surrounding his creaky tenor with a halo of reverb. With Kapow!, Sounds of Greg D, Half Cleveland and Crescent Moon. At 7:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $8. (Sisario) GENE WEEN (Tonight) This singer, one-half of the ingenious and underrated comedy-rock-turned-jam-band duo Ween, is on a rare solo tour. With Chris Harford and the Band of Changes. At 9, Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $20.50. (Sisario) * LUCINDA WILLIAMS (Tonight) With homely details and the names of Southern cities, Ms. Williams maps a geography of loss and longing in her songs. The twang and determination in her voice and her rock-ribbed melodies insist that she won't crumple. With the Heartless Bastards. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $35 to $70. (Pareles) YOU AM I (Sunday) With its exhilarating rave-ups and Tim Rogers's windmill guitar slashes -- both recalling the best of the Who -- You Am I is one of the most exciting bands to come out of Australia in a decade, though it has struggled for recognition here. A strong new album, ''Convicts'' (Yep Roc), might change that. With White Rabbits and Bon Savants. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. GERI ALLEN (Tonight) Ms. Allen's piano playing reflects a spectrum of blues and gospel tonalities, and rarely settles for complacent facility. She performs a solo recital at the Klavierhaus piano workshop. At 8, Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $25. (Nate Chinen) OMER AVITAL (Tomorrow) Mr. Avital, a rugged bassist and insistently creative composer, marks the release of his new album, ''Arrival'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), with a group including Omer Klein on piano and Ferenc Nemeth on drums.

At 8:30 and 10 p.m., Rose Live Music, 345 Grand Street, near Marcy Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-0069, newlanguages.org; $10.

(Chinen) * ANTHONY BRAXTON (Thursday) Mr. Braxton, a sphinxlike eminence in the avant-garde, has an extravagant new box set that chronicles an engagement here last year. Once again he wields an array of reed instruments and an ensemble stocked with smart acolytes, like the cornetist Taylor Ho Bynum and the guitarist Mary Halvorson. (Through April 1.) At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $32.50, with a $10 minimum.

Then Mr. Weiss leads a trio with Mr. Sacks and the bassist Thomas Morgan. At 8 and 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) HENRY GRIMES AND AMINA CLAUDINE MYERS (Wednesday) Mr. Grimes, a bassist, and Ms. Myers, a pianist and vocalist, are unpredictable entities in the jazz avant-garde; if they find common ground, their dialogue should be intriguing. At 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) JOEL HARRISON'S STRING CHOIR (Tonight) The compositions of the drummer Paul Motian can convey shadowy depths even as they echo the simplicity of folk songs. Here they benefit from string arrangements by the guitarist Joel Harrison for an improvising string sextet. At 9 and 10:30, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) * ANDREW HILL TRIO (Thursday) With ''Time Lines'' (Blue Note), the pianist and composer Andrew Hill delivered one of last year's standout recordings, and one of the strongest of his distinguished career. His trio, with John Hebert on bass and Eric McPherson on drums, traffics in mysterious harmonies and elliptical tempos; the group should sound marvelous in a parish setting. At 1 p.m., Trinity Church, Broadway at Wall Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 602-0800, trinitywallstreet.org; no cover. (Chinen) JAZZ IS A BEAUTIFUL THING (Tonight) An aptly named evening with a luxuriously comfortable all-star quintet: Frank Wess on tenor saxophone, Cecil Bridgewater on trumpet, Harold Mabern on piano, Rufus Reid on bass and Ben Riley on drums.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera * 'DIE ÄGYPTISCHE HELENA' (Tonight and Tuesday night) With its convoluted libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and unevenly inspired score by Richard Strauss, this wry contemporary take on the Helen of Troy myth has remained a rarity since its 1928 premiere. But the Metropolitan Opera's fancifully surreal new production by David Fielding, mounted for the soprano Deborah Voigt, makes a compelling case for this intriguing work, thanks to Ms. Voigt's vocally lustrous and affecting portrayal of the title role, as well as the vibrant and insightful conducting of Fabio Luisi. The brilliant coloratura Diana Damrau is wonderful as the sorceress Aithra, who lures the unfaithful Helena and her avenging husband, Menelas, to her enchanted island to patch up their marriage. The German tenor Torsten Kerl, who because of illness had to be replaced halfway through the performance on opening night, is scheduled to sing Menelas for the remaining performances. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $70 to $295 tonight; $80 to $175 for Tuesday. (Anthony Tommasini) 'ANDREA CHÉNIER' (Monday and Thursday) Set in the 18th century, but very much a product of the 19th, Giordano's Italian drama of the French Revolution returns to the Metropolitan Opera with a cast that is able to sing very, very loudly, if not always especially elegantly or with particular Italian flair: Violeta Urmana, Ben Heppner and Mark Delavan. Marco Armiliato, who is becoming a solid presence in the pit, conducts. Monday at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $275. (Anne Midgette) * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow) Bartlett Sher's breezy production of Rossini's opera conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality of the characters also comes through, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing. The baritone Peter Mattei is a robust and agile Figaro. The tenor Juan Diego Flórez could not be more adorable as the amorous Count Almaviva. The captivating young mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato is a vocally agile and feisty Rosina. The virile bass-baritone John Relyea makes the wily Don Basilio seem delightfully dangerous. Maurizio Benini conducts. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini) * 'LA DONNA DEL LAGO' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The New York City Opera's last foray into the little-known world of Rossini's serious operas was successful enough that the company returned to another one, with the same two leads featured in ''Ermione'' a few seasons ago. Alexandrina Pendatchanska is an intense, committed soprano; Barry Banks, the tenor, is emerging as someone to watch. Chas Rader-Shieber, the director, has brought an antic touch to his two previous outings with the company, ''Flavio'' (which returns this spring) and ''Orlando.'' George Manahan conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $130. (Midgette) 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tonight, Sunday and Tuesday) Mark Lamos's austere and effective production gets perfectly acceptable singing in this New York City Opera revival of Puccini's weepy masterpiece. With Angela Maria Blasi and Raúl Melo. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Bernard Holland) * 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' (Tomorrow and Thursday) Lillian Groag avoids topical updating and focuses on the work's own satirical targets. Even so, her direction for this City Opera production is inventive and lively, as are the performances by a cast that includes Sarah Jane McMahon as Mabel, Matt Morgan as Frederic, Marc Kudisch as the Pirate King and Mark Jacoby as Major General Stanley. Gerald Steichen conducts. Tomorrow at 8, Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $130. (Allan Kozinn) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) For its revival of Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production, the Met is rotating casts, with several sopranos sharing the role of Violetta this season. Tomorrow evening, for only one performance, the Violetta will be the Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu, whose portrayal of this role in a Covent Garden production made her famous. On Wednesday the earthy Bulgarian soprano Krassimira Stoyanova sings Violetta, the role of her 2001 Met debut. For both performances the compelling German tenor Jonas Kaufmann sings Alfredo, Violetta's lover, with the veteran American baritone Dwayne Croft as Alfredo's tragically interfering father, Germont. Marco Armiliato conducts. Tomorrow and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $27 to $150 tomorrow; $15 to $175 for Wednesday. (Tommasini) Classical Music * AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Monday) Dennis Russell Davies, who was the orchestra's conductor from its founding until 2002, returns to celebrate its 30th anniversary. The program is devoted mostly to concertolike works in which the composers are the soloists. The works are Steven Mackey's ''Deal'' (for electric guitar); ''Inventions'' by the jazz pianist Vijay Iyer; Kurt Rohde's ''White Boy/Man Invisible'' (for viola); Harold Meltzer's ''Virginal'' (for harpsichord); Andrew McKenna Lee's ''Arabescata'' (for guitar); Min Xiao-Fen's ''Blue Pipa'' (for the pipa, a Chinese lute); and Tania León's ''Indígena.'' At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to 40.

The solo works include Debussy's ''Syrinx'' for solo flute, and Stravinsky's modernist ''Three Pieces for Clarinet Solo.'' Chamber works include Elliott Carter's ''Esprit Rude/Esprit Doux II'' for Flute, Clarinet and Marimba; Hindemith's ''Kleine Kammermusik'' for Woodwind Quintet; Mozart's Quintet for Piano and Winds (K. 452); and Spohr's Grand Nonetto in F for Winds and Strings (Op. 31).

(Vivien Schweitzer) * GERALD FINLEY (Tonight) This 47-year-old Canadian baritone had long been respected for his warm voice and discerning musicianship when his riveting portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer in the world premiere of John Adams's ''Doctor Atomic'' at the San Francisco Opera in 2005 brought him deserved international attention. For his Zankel Hall recital he sings songs by Schumann, Ives, Barber and Ned Rorem, accompanied by the elegant pianist Julius Drake. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $36 to $42. (Tommasini) * LOUIS LORTIE (Tomorrow) Mr. Lortie, a superb, intellectual Canadian pianist plays Chopin's Sonata in B minor (Op. 58) and the Nocturne in B (Op. 62, No. 1). Liszt is another specialty. Here he will play the Overture to Wagner's ''Tannhäuser'' and ''Vallée d'Obermann,'' part of Liszt's ''Années de Pèlerinage.'' Mr. Lortie also champions the music of the British composer Thomas Adès and will round out the recital with Adès's ''Darknesse Visible.'' At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $82. (Schweitzer) * MAKING MUSIC: GEORGE BENJAMIN (Thursday) It is hard to generalize about the English composer George Benjamin, 47, a prodigy who wrote his first works 40 years ago. He has explored diverse styles and schools. He will discuss his work, including his renewed interest in vigorous counterpoint, with Ara Guzelimian, host of the Making Music series at Zankel Hall. Several of Mr. Benjamin's works will be performed, including two piano pieces composed for, and played by, the brilliant Pierre-Laurent Aimard, who is back in New York to continue his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25. (Tommasini) MATA FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) This downtown festival, now in its ninth year, has moved across the East River to the Brooklyn Lyceum, but is still finding fresh scores by young, inventive composers. Tonight the Knights ensemble plays new works by Matthew Barnson, Andrew Norman, Filippo Perocco and Christopher Tignor. There is also a preconcert panel discussion with the composers, moderated by the critic Alex Ross. At 8 p.m. (the discussion is at 6:45), 227 Fourth Avenue, at President Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 857-4816, matafestival.org; $15. (Kozinn) * NDR SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday and Tuesday) The classical world was startled when the conductor Christoph von Dohnanyi, having left a successful tenure at the Cleveland Orchestra, took over the reliable but less internationally glamorous orchestra of North German Radio. Now, that orchestra is getting a new hall (the Elbphilharmonie) in Hamburg, and is showing its stuff in two concerts with the violinist Vadim Repin: Schnittke's Violin Concerto No. 4 and Brahms's First Symphony on Monday, and Mendelsson's concerto, Ligeti's ''Lontano'' and Mahler's First Symphony on Tuesday. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 to $89. (Midgette) * NEW AMSTERDAM SINGERS (Tonight and Sunday) Matt Haimovitz, an innovative cellist, joins the New Amsterdam Singers and Clara Longstreth in ''Après Moi, le Déluge,'' by Luna Pearl Woolf, a composer and Mr. Haimovitz's wife. The work was inspired by Ms. Woolf's distress at the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and takes its title from a quotation often attributed to the decadent and irresponsible Louis XV of France. The program also includes Bach's Cello Suite No. 2 (with Mr. Haimovitz as soloist) and choral works by Brahms, Carissimi, Purcell, Bach and Kirke Mechem. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., Holy Trinity Church, 316 East 88th Street, Manhattan, (212) 842-1511, nasingers.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Mozart is writ large this week at the Philharmonic, but in two very different hands. Make that four hands: two of them belonging to Mitsuko Uchida, who this weekend offers the Piano Concerto No. 19 (K. 459), and the two others belonging to Radu Lupu, who will play the Piano Concerto No. 27 (K. 595) on Thursday. The two pianists join in a program on Wednesday that includes the piano concertos, as well as Mozart's Concerto for Two Pianos in E flat. Colin Davis conducts the three concerts, which also include the Schubert Fourth (this weekend), Mozart's Symphony No. 32 in G (Wednesday) and Sibelius's ''Lemminkainen'' Suite (on Thursday). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $99.

At 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $26 to $51. (Holland) * STEVE REICH (Tonight and tomorrow) The Miller Theater is celebrating Steve Reich's 70th birthday with an installment of its Composer Portraits series in which So Percussion and friends will perform Mr. Reich's epochal ''Music for 18 Musicians'' and his somewhat less epochal but still riveting ''Music for Pieces of Wood.'' At 8, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $25. (Kozinn) ST. THOMAS CHOIR (Tonight) With Easter approaching, performances of Bach's Passion settings are about to become plentiful in New York's churches and concert halls. This superb choir of men and boys, joined by Musica Angelica Los Angeles and the Vienna Academy Orchestra, gets in early with what looks like a promising performance of the ''St. Matthew Passion.'' Martin Haselböck conducts, Andreas Karsiak is the Evangelis, and Stephen Salters sings Christus, with Christine Brandes, Carlos Mena and Mark Bleeke filling out the roster of soloists. At 7:30, St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360, saintthomaschurch.org; $20 to $80. (Kozinn) * STUTTGART CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Since regaining the use of his right hand, which for decades was afflicted with focal dystonia, the pianist Leon Fleisher has made a successful return to performing and recording two-hand piano repertory. On Thursday he appears with the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra as soloist (conducting from the keyboard) in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 12 in A, and as conductor in Boccherini's Symphony in D minor, Mendelssohn's String Symphony No. 10 in B minor and Haydn's Symphony No. 45. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $50. (Schweitzer) TRINITY CHOIR (Tuesday) Owen Burdick and his excellent choir continue their tour of European choral music with a program of works by the Haydn brothers -- Joseph, represented by the ''Lord Nelson'' Mass, and Michael, whose Requiem will be performed. The choir will be accompanied by the Rebel Baroque Orchestra. At 6 p.m., Trinity Church, Broadway at Wall Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 602-0747, trinitywallstreet.org; $20 to $40; $15 for students and 65+. (Kozinn) TRIO MEDIAEVAL and CRASH ENSEMBLE (Wednesday) The vibrant Dublin-based Crash Ensemble, a new-music group specializing in multimedia performances, makes its New York debut playing works by its founder, Donnacha Dennehy, including the United States premiere of ''Gra Agus Bas'' and the world premiere of ''Stainless Staining.'' It will be joined by the superb Scandinavian singers of Trio Mediaeval for this concert, the final event this season in Merkin Concert Hall's New Sounds Live series. At 8 p.m., 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $35 in advance, $40 at the door. (Schweitzer) * WOLFIADE: WOLFGANG HOLZMAIR SINGS HUGO WOLF (Tuesday and Wednesday) On the model of a ''Schubertiade'' -- a festival of Schubert's songs -- comes a ''Wolfiade,'' devoted to the songs of Hugo Wolf and featuring another Wolf, the baritone Wolfgang Holzmair. The mini-festival will include three free recitals at Weill Recital Hall -- the first, on Tuesday, features Wolf's Goethe songs, with Mr. Holzmair and the mezzo Hermine Haselböck; the next two feature the complete Italian and Spanish songbooks -- as well as a series of master classes during which six selected singers will work on refining Wolf songs for a concluding recital on April 4; the first master class is on Wednesday. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; free. Wednesday at 2 p.m., Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org; free. (Midgette) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. IVY BALDWIN DANCE (Wednesday and Thursday) In her new ''Don't Worry, It's Only Me,'' Ivy Baldwin burrows into the animal-like instincts in all of us, a theme that sounds just right for her gift for dark comedy.

At 7, Winter Garden, World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Dunning) DANCES PATRELLE (Tonight through Sunday) New ballets by Mr. Patrelle and Leda Meredith will explore the battle of the sexes and the challenges of caring for aging parents on a program that also features the guest dancers Jenifer Ringer and Stephen Hanna, both New York City Ballet principals, and Jonathan Porretta, a principal with Pacific Northwest Ballet. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 6:30 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, dancespatrelle.org; $35; $150 for a gala tonight with a reception. (Dunning) 'EDWARD SCISSORHANDS' (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Conceived, directed and choreographed by Matthew Bourne, this re-envisioning of Tim Burton's dark 1990 film of the same title revisits the theme of the outsider, here a gentle boy with scissors for hands. (Through March 31.) Tonight at 7:30, tomorrow at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Tuesday through Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 6:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $30 to $80. (Dunning) THE 4 TANGO SEASONS (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This show explores nature's cycles as seen by a man and a woman in love. (Through April 1.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 729-3880, thaliatheatre.org; $30; $27 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Flamenco Vivo Carlota Santana (Tuesday through Thursday) This popular Spanish-American company will focus on the use of castanets in a new work and also offer traditional flamenco dances accompanied by onstage musicians. (Through April 1.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $40; $30 for Joyce members. (Roslyn Sulcas) Levi Gonzalez (Thursday) Mr. Gonzalez, who has performed with John Jasperse and a host of A-list downtown choreographers, brings a new work with a name unsuitable for print in this publication. In any event, news releases claim that it ''smashes through codes, indulges in extremity and excess, and embraces chaos.'' Bet you haven't guessed that title yet. (Through March 31.) At 7.30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6500, dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, artists and 65+. (Sulcas) LYDIA JOHNSON DANCE (Tomorrow) Lydia Johnson does interesting things with the formal concepts of classical dance. This program includes a new piece set to music by Ray LaMontagne. At 8 p.m., South Orange Performing Arts Center, One SOPAC Way, South Orange, N.J., (973) 313-2787, sopacnow.org; $35; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning) * MADE IN CATALUNYA: CATALAN CULTURE IN NEW YORK (Monday) Sol Picó's multimedia ''Kiss Me the Cactus'' addresses powerful images of fear, but with humor. It is one of two free dance programs -- the other is by the august Cesc Gelabert on March 31 -- to be presented in this weeklong festival of Catalan dance, theater, music and poetry, held in conjunction with the exhibition ''Barcelona and Modernity: Gaudí to Dalí,'' at the Metropolitan Museum. At 8:30 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200 for reservations (required), baryshnikovdancefoundation.org. (Dunning) MIRO MAGLOIRE'S NEW CHAMBER BALLET (Tonight and tomorrow night) In this ''Italian Evening,'' the musically astute Miro Magloire will present ballets set to music by Italian composers from Berio to Corelli, performed live. At 8:30, City Center Studio 4, 130 West 56th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. Tickets: $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Eliza Miller (Thursday) Eliza Miller trained as a pianist before beginning to dance, and she retains a particular interest in the musical side of things. Her new work, ''O Death,'' is a collaboration with the British composer Oscar Bettison, who has composed a requiem Mass, played live by a Dutch music group, Ensemble Klang. (Through April 1.) At 8.30 p.m., Danspace Project, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15; $10 for members. (Sulcas) * PEAK PERFORMANCES: VINCENT DANCE THEATER (Tomorrow and Sunday) From Sheffield, England, Charlotte Vincent and her modern-dance troupe will perform ''Broken Chords'' in the Peak Performances avant-garde showcase at Montclair State University. Inspired by Ms. Vincent's divorce, this piece has been described as a portrait of grief, both searing and funny. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, 1 Normal Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112; $25. (Dunning) DESMOND RICHARDsON AND THE ALL STARS PROJECT (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Mr. Richardson and 15 performers from All Stars, a cultural program for teenagers from New York City and Newark, have created ''Homeland Security: Bringing Dr. King Up to Date,'' a multimedia piece that questions American notions of ''homeland'' and ''security.'' (Through April 4.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., All Stars Project Theater, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 941-1234, allstars.org; $30 and $35; T.D.F. vouchers accepted. (Dunning) MELISSA RIKER & KINESIS PROJECT (Tonight through Sunday) The company will perform Ms. Riker's ''Right Before You Fell,'' a program she describes as a playful and sensuous athletic dance that explores the moments when something is not being said. Tonight at 9, tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $20.

(Dunning) AMY DAWN VEREBAY (Thursday) A member of the wild and wacky Circus Amok, Ms. Verebay will present a dance-theater production called ''Once in Love with Amy'' that chronicles her attempts to turn ''her life's lead into gold,'' as she puts it. At 8 p.m., WOW Café Theater, 59-61 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 545-5334; $12. (Dunning) * ANN LIV YOUNG (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Young would probably have no quarrel with describing her new ""Snow White"" as lewd, crude and socially unattractive, attributes she cultivates cheerfully in this tale of psychosexual involvements between the heroine, her Prince and the Evil Stepmother. At 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org; $12. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: MARTíN RAMíREZ, through May 13. Ramírez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters. But most of all, Ramírez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) * Asia Society: Glass, Gilding, and Grand Design: Art of Sasanian Iran (224-642 A.D.), through May 20. With some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, this is the first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Grace Glueck) Guggenheim Museum: 'Family Pictures,' through April 16. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents posing awkwardly against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children, has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) * The METropolitan museum of art: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural cross-currents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * The Met: 'Mother of Pearl: A Tradition in Asian Lacquer,' through April 1. Ornamentalism is the term for this show of some 40 objects so preposterously exquisite that they might have been conceived with a modern museum conservator's soft white cotton gloves in mind. The technique for creating mini-mosaics from slivers of mollusk shell is an ancient one that was perfected in China before traveling to Korea, Japan, Thailand and India. Examples from all those places are here in writing boxes and tea trays guaranteed to appeal to any window-shopper's acquisitive yearnings and magpie eye. (See above.) (Cotter) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * Moma: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies are enthralling visual vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (See above.) (Smith) WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: 'FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,' through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you'll find treasures like ''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum. But the pièce de résistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer's inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org (Glueck) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Gordon MaTTA-cLARK rETROSPECTIVE,' through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lorna Simpson,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown * PHILIP TAAFFE This artist's first New York show since 2000 anoints him as one of the best painters of his generation, and maybe the only one to extend both 1970s Pattern and Decoration and 80s appropriation into new areas. Aided by Warhol's tinted colors and Pollock's all-over rhythms, and some ingenious printing techniques of their own, these suavely eye-popping new paintings sample everything from Northwest Coast Indian masks to Islamic ornamental patterns to marbleizing and gilding. They define visual culture as a great chain of being in which anything can be connected with proper placement, color and scale in an inspiring message of unity in difference. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-2313, www.gagosian.com, through March 31. (Smith) Last Chance PIERO GOLIA It's Dada redux in the New York debut of a clever young Italian post-Conceptualist who, for the occasion, comes up with novel ways to tell time. A drop of water falls from the gallery's ceiling once a minute. A broom rotates once a second. And 17 minutes after every hour, a clay pigeon is shot at a wall, creating a nice build-up of debris. The regularity of nature, labor and pointless human violence (and trash) are sparely but effectively evoked. Bortolami Dayan, 510 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2050, bortolamidayan.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' This show is spectacularly grand and avoids the familiar piety of the standard masterpiece potpourri by virtue of its eloquent installation in the museum's loopy ramp, still the weirdest-coolest place to look at art and at other people looking at art. It's carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. The show's big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time.

(Kimmelman) MERLIN JAMES: PAINTING TO PAINTING Nearly three dozen small canvases by this British artist prove that old-fashioned appropriation -- forthright homages to other painters' paintings -- remains pertinent. Tribute is paid to works like Millet's ''Sower,'' Daumier's ''Don Quixote and Sancho Panza'' and ''Bonnard's ''Self-Portrait in the Bathroom Mirror.'' Some are instantly recognizable. Others border on the abstract. But all achieve a sense of life and mystery on their own terms, in the here and now. And the use of precedents reduces the arbitrariness that can afflict Mr. James's work. New York Studio School, 8 West Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-6466, www.nyss.org; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK' This display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York, with a special section putting his work in dialogue with items from the museum's collection. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to the city's edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here in one incarnation, looming majestically over humble brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too, like the public relations executive Benjamin Sonnenberg, depicted in 1950 adorning a pompous Victorian interior, a short figure tightly buttoned into a bespoke suit, his head topped by a derby, his face decorated by a handlebar mustache. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. ''Fur Coats'' (1951) portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but this show makes it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck) * DAVID SALLE: 'BEARDING THE LION IN HIS DEN' This re-creation of a haunting installation Mr. Salle exhibited at the Kitchen in 1977, just before he took up painting, gives a glimpse of the influence of 1970s anti-object art on 80s painting. The accompanying Tim Buckley song may carry a little too much of the emotional load, but the piece is nonetheless a fascinating skeleton key both to Mr. Salle's coolly romantic sensibility and his penchant for juxtaposition and layering, as are some early works on paper. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300, www.deitch.com; closes tomorrow.

2007-03-23T00:00:00Z,"''Offside,'' the new film from the Iranian director Jafar Panahi, is a sports movie in which the game takes place entirely out of sight. The setting, most of the time, is a stadium in Tehran, where the Iranian national soccer team is facing Bahrain in a qualifying match for the World Cup. We hear the cheers and groans of the crowd and some improvised play-by-play from a few spectators, but like the film's main characters -- die-hard supporters of the team, some of them adorned with face paint in the red, white and green of the Iranian flag -- we never see what is happening on the field. Those unlucky fans are young women, whose attempts to see the match live are stymied by the police and by strict rules forbidding the mixing of the sexes. Trying to pass for boys, a half-dozen of them have been rounded up and confined to a makeshift holding pen on a ramp outside the stadium walls. The young soldiers who are their captors seem to be just as confused and demoralized as the women themselves, and the film's rich, pointed comedy arises from the sense that all of them, men and women alike, are trapped in an absurd, insoluble predicament."

2007-03-23T00:00:00Z,"When the 3LD Art & Technology Center was under construction last year, workers unearthed a silent black-and-white film from beneath a concrete slab. A 1927 movie, it told the dark tale of a maid and a long-suffering valet who set out to murder their sinister boss. The film has been restored and is being shown at 3LD. O.K., not really, but that is the premise for ''The Curse of the Mystic Renaldo The,'' which really is onstage at 3LD and has been extended through April 28. ''Curse,'' right, is a noir-tinted comedy that mixes elements of film, vaudeville, cabaret, theater and rock to create, well, an oddity of experimental theater. Aldo Perez, the show's creator and star, is Renaldo The, whom audience members (munching free popcorn handed out preshow) first see in a movie clip. Renaldo's chambermaid (Jenny Lee Mitchell) and his valet (a resolutely deadpan Richard Ginocchio) are plotting his murder, and just as they are doing the deed, the movie screen falls to the floor, revealing live actors. A dream sequence, of sorts, ensues -- perhaps Renaldo's life is flashing before our eyes? All who attend must abandon the search for narrative structure, unless perhaps the story of 3LD's stagehands will suffice. They are visible throughout, and they are just as intriguing as the characters onstage. Renaldo's free-associative monologues and a series of hallucinatory vignettes mix with rock music interludes, courtesy of Mr. Perez and members of his band, Psycho the Clown, as psychosexual power struggles play out among the three main characters. ''Curse'' even has a slight touch of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' about it -- at moments, Mr. Perez and his fellow actors seem to fight against laughing at their own shenanigans. Or are they smirking at that rubber chicken that becomes an unlikely object of Renaldo's affection? (Fridays and Saturdays at 10 p.m., through April 28, 3LD Art & Technology Center, 80 Greenwich Street, between Edgar and Rector, Lower Manhattan, 212-352-3101, theatermania.com; $20). STEVEN McELROY"

Before you can say, ''What's that again?,'' Taylor is having dream-infused seizures, during which he sees running children, flapping vegetation and a masked man in a black duster.

Packed in just a dozen unmarked cardboard boxes, they had been gathered and sent illegally from the Philippines and were in bad shape, dehydrated with broken stems, wilted flowers and crushed leaves. The waning treasures -- some were worth as much as $500 -- were sent to the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx for rehabilitation, one of the few places in the country capable of that kind of care. Now these wayward blooms have been nursed back to health and are on display as part of the fifth annual Orchid Show there. The country's largest curator-organized exhibition, it features more than 8,000 individual flowers, from the platystele, a miniature dotted with tiny blossoms smaller than the head of a pin, to the cattelya, which has a 10-inch flower. Unlike a juried floral competition, this display features history and information about the seeding, care and biology of the orchid, a plant that has fascinated people since at least 1000 B.C., when it appeared in the writings of Confucius, said Marc Hachadourian, the exhibit's curator."

The ruling Thursday by the judge, Frank Roesch of Alameda County Superior Court, found that the State Department of Water Resources lacked the proper permits to run a crucial station that pumps water from the delta into the California Aqueduct. Specifically, Judge Roesch said the water agency should apply for permits that would allow it to kill spring and winter runs of salmon and delta smelt, which are protected under state law. At issue is the Harvey O. Banks Pumping Plant west of Stockton, which funnels 10,688 cubic feet per second of water through 11 pumps into the 444-mile long aqueduct."

Now, he says he saw the lights, too, and believes they were extraterrestrial. He said he did not acknowledge his encounter at first because he did not want to cause a panic. He discussed the sighting with a documentary filmmaker and in interviews this week. He told CNN that the craft he saw March 13, 1997, “just felt otherworldly.” The Phoenix lights, which appeared in a V shape as they moved across the sky, were widely explained as flares dumped by a military training flight."
2007-03-24T00:00:00Z,Coal mines will get increased scrutiny from state inspectors under legislation signed into law by Gov. Ernie Fletcher. The law will require inspectors from the Office of Mine Safety and Licensing to double their visits to underground coal mines to a minimum of six a year. Two of the annual inspections must focus on electrical work inside mines. The law also requires at least one member of every underground crew to have a detector to monitor for the explosive gas methane. Miners working alone would also have a detector. The law follows one of the deadliest years in recent history for Kentucky coal miners; 16 miners were killed in 2006.

Witnesses said the fighting began when the presidential guard tried to disarm Mr. Bemba’s men, who responded with machine-gun fire. The government then wheeled in tanks and heavy artillery.

The authorities issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Bemba, accusing him of “high treason.” He and his wife holed up in the South African Embassy, one of the most heavily fortified buildings in Kinshasa."

2007-03-24T00:00:00Z,"A Museum Sale Sets a Record A 10th-century granite statue owned by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo went for $4.07 million yesterday at Sotheby's in New York, setting an auction record for a work of traditional Indian art. The statue, depicting the Hindu god Shiva as Brahma, above, was purchased by John Eskenazi, a London dealer assumed to be acting for an anonymous buyer. The previous auction record for classical Indian art was set on Wednesday at Christie's, where a bronze statue of a goddess went for $2.7 million. The auction is one of a series at Sotheby's through which the Albright-Knox is divesting itself of centuries-old pieces of Chinese, Indian, South American and ancient Roman art. The museum said the pieces were irrelevant to its central mission, which is contemporary art, but the decision has stirred controversy in Buffalo and the art world. The 11 works offered by the Albright-Knox in yesterday's sale brought in $7.2 million, including Sotheby's commission. On Tuesday the museum made more than $18 million in a sale of Chinese artifacts. Star Power The actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, whose only film together, ''Titanic,'' in 1997, earned more than $1.8 billion at the box office, the most of any movie in history, will star in ''Revolutionary Road,'' Variety reported yesterday.

Sam Mendes, the director of ''American Beauty'' and Ms. Winslet's husband, will direct. Justin Haythe will write the screenplay.

The prize was established in honor of Mr. Rohr by his family to recognize emerging writers of exceptional literary merit whose work stimulates an interest in Jewish themes. Two runners-up -- Amir Gutfreund, author of ''Our Holocaust,'' and Michael Lavigne, author of ''Not Me'' -- will each receive the Choice Award and $7,500. The awards committee included the novelist Rebecca Goldstein; Jeremy Dauber, a professor of Yiddish at Columbia; Daisy Maryles, executive editor of Publishers Weekly; Jonathan Rosen, the editorial director of Nextbook; and Ruth Wisse, professor of Yiddish and comparative literature at Harvard. The three winners will be honored at a ceremony in Manhattan on May 21. Ancient Art, Home Safely Two rare artifacts that Greece says were looted from its soil have arrived in Athens after their handover by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the Greek Culture Ministry said yesterday. A ministry official said the items, a gold funerary wreath from the fourth century B.C. and a marble woman's torso from the sixth century B.C., were in excellent condition and would be permanently exhibited at the Archaeological Museum in Athens. The Getty agreed to return the two objects last December after reviewing evidence presented by the Greek government, which had argued for about a decade that the pieces had been illegally removed from the country. The Getty acquired both objects in 1993 for about $4.4 million. The wreath figures into a Greek investigation of a former Getty museum curator, Marion True, and Christophe Léon, a Swiss-based art dealer involved in the Getty purchase. Last summer the Getty transferred ownership of a fourth-century-B.C. engraved funeral stele and a late fifth-century-B.C. engraved sculpture to Greece.

The man, Michael Contreni of Brooklyn, was arrested at the Farragut Housing Projects in Downtown Brooklyn and charged in federal court with three counts of bank robbery. According to the police, Mr. Contreni used the $3,100 taken in the robberies to buy drugs for himself and others. In each robbery, a man walked into a bank in Brooklyn Heights, threatened to detonate a box filled with explosives, then demanded money from a teller and fled. And in each case, the police were forced to shut down several streets for hours at a time while bomb squads examined the devices, all of which turned out to be harmless. One of the boxes was empty, a second had a container of milk, and the third held battery cables and two containers of liquid, Sgt. Robert Young said. Mr. Contreni was arrested shortly after the last robbery, which took place about 4 p.m. on Thursday at a Citibank at 376 Court Street.

Jerry Schmetterer, a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office, said the case was dropped because of insufficient evidence. The custodian, Frank Evelyn, 58, who started working at Public School 91 in East Flatbush in 1988, will be reinstated immediately, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education said. Questions dogged the case, and a law enforcement official said the victim told conflicting stories about what took place. After the girl made the allegations, education officials reassigned Solomon Long, the school's principal, to an administrative job, saying he failed to report the child's previous claims of abuse involving someone who did not work at the school. The girl had also complained about being sexually abused by her father and a young classmate, a city official said. CARA BUCKLEY"

By yesterday, more than two dozen people had been killed. Bodies were sprawled in the streets. Some of the fallen fighters wore grass headdresses and amulets thought to bestow magical powers. The authorities issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Bemba, accusing him of ''high treason.'' He and his wife holed up in the South African Embassy, one of the most heavily fortified buildings in Kinshasa. JEFFREY GETTLEMAN"

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Ayaan Hirsi Ali and her new book, ''Infidel,'' deserved better than Ian Buruma's review (March 4). While expressing admiration for her ''courage,'' he rejects her ''descriptions of life in the West'' as ''idealized,'' with an ''almost comic-book quality.'' Elsewhere, he derides her view of the West as ''a caricature of sweetness and light.'' Meanwhile, he challenges the notion, presumably Hirsi Ali's, that ''Europeans who argue ... that Muslims might feel more at home in the West if we offered a modicum of respect for their religion, instead of insulting them at every turn, are 'stupid' or worse.''"

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"The tour is called METAL FOR THE MASSES, named after the compilation series of the same name. But like many heavy-metal tours, this one succeeds by ignoring ''the masses'' altogether. Metal bands long ago made the happy discovery that they could survive, even thrive, without support from rock radio or mainstream music magazines (or, for that matter, mainstream music blogs). The genre encourages obsession, and more than just about any other fans, metal fans have learned to track their favorite sounds and musicians across international borders. Americans are often accused of ignoring so-called world music, but metal is one kind of world music that thrives here. The tour, which arrives at the Gramercy Theater on Monday, brings together three Swedish bands and a Canadian one. Among other things Sweden is the home of a triumphant-sounding metal subgenre called melodic death metal; DARK TRANQUILLITY is one of the standard-bearers and the grandiose SCAR SYMMETRY is one of the newest exemplars. THE HAUNTED was founded by Swedish veterans, including former members of the influential melodic death-metal band At the Gates. Last year the Haunted released ''The Dead Eye'' (Century Media), a twisted and twisty album that ranges from thrash to progressive rock. The Canadian band is INTO ETERNITY, an unpredictable group from Regina, Saskatchewan, that jumps from warp-speed riffs to off-tempo breaks to old-fashioned howling refrains, which should inspire plenty of singing along on Monday. 8 p.m., 127 East 23rd Street, (212) 777-6800; $16 in advance, $19 at the door."

But that analog annoyance may fade away as radio broadcasters, carmakers and consumer electronics companies make the transition to digital radio."

Were it otherwise, concert attire and program notes would presumably be superfluous. But isn't the underlying reason for this fiasco that today's professional-level classical performances all sound pretty much alike? So long as performers continue to place much more emphasis on fidelity to a score than on interpretative individuality, context will be practically all that matters. Ben Givan Saratoga Springs, N.Y."

In a video interview taped in December for TheStreet.com that quickly turned into a big hit on YouTube last week before CNBC had it removed, Mr. Cramer laid out in bombastic detail how to really make mad money on Wall Street. He would ''foment,'' he said, to push a stock up or down. If he wanted a stock's price to fall, he recommended spreading negative information about the company to a ''bozo reporter'' at The Wall Street Journal. Bob Pisani, a CNBC reporter, is another useful conduit of damaging rumors, he said. ''No one else in the world would ever admit it,'' he said of the various methods, ''but I don't care.''"

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"An essay on March 4, ''Confessions of a Book Abuser,'' by Ben Schott, defended the ways people physically ''mistreat'' books. Readers have subsequently pointed out a number of resemblances between Schott's essay and ''Never Do That to a Book,'' an essay on the same subject by Anne Fadiman that was part of her 1998 collection ''Ex Libris: Confessions of a Common Reader.'' Among several thematic similarities that readers commented on are ones involving a system of dog-earing pages either at the top or at the bottom depending on referential purpose and travelers who rip previously read sections from paperbacks and discard them before boarding an airplane. But the most striking resemblance occurs in the opening lines of each essay. Schott's begins: ''I have to admit I was flattered when, returning to my hotel room on the shores of Lake Como, a beautiful Italian chambermaid took my hand. ... Escorting me to the edge of the crisply made bed, the chambermaid pointed to a book on my bedside table. 'Does this belong to you?' she asked. I looked down to see a dog-eared copy of Evelyn Waugh's 'Vile Bodies' open spread-eagle, its cracked spine facing out. 'Yes,' I replied.

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"IT'S official: middle schools are a mess. If you didn't already suspect this, a battery of standardized tests, some of which are required under the No Child Left Behind law, have confirmed that in rich and poor school districts alike, reading and math scores drop from fifth to sixth grade, when most students move to middle school. What's worse is that the scores continue to decline through eighth grade, as do students' self-esteem and engagement in school. Sadly, no one seems to know what to do about these schools, which generally serve 11- to 13-year-olds. The solutions that most educators have come up with tend to involve restructuring the schools, including assigning students to fewer teachers during the day, decreasing class size or the school size, or changing the schools to either kindergarten through eighth grade or sixth through 12th grade. These responses, however, have not altered the pattern of decline during the middle school years."

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"POEPPLEIN--Ronald F. Beloved friend and colleague. Ron graduated Brooklyn Law School in 1978 and immediately became a student of the law, an outstanding trial attorney, an accomplished legal writer and appellate attorney. He was a fellow of The American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, one of the youngest ever elected, and had been president of the Criminal Courts Bar Association of Nassau County. He was also a member of the American, New York State and Nassau County Bar Associations. He was included in Who's Who in American Law. In 1996 he co-authored the second edition of a two-volume work on separation agreements and marital contracts. For many years he shared his legal wisdom as an adjunct professor at Adelphi University where he taught matrimonial law in the Lawyers Assistant Program. His reputation for skillfully litigating complex cases was well known in the legal community. There was never a task too big for Ron. It was a privilege for all of us to work with Ron. Our hearts go out to his loving wife Lorraine, and his family. The wake will be held at the Cassidy Funeral home, 156 Willis Avenue, Mineola, New York, on Sunday, March 25, 2007, from 2-5 pm and 7-9 pm. A mass will be held on Monday, March 26, 2007, at the Corpus Christi RC Church, 155 Garfield Avenue, Mineola, New York (off Willis Avenue) at 9:30 am. All of Rons friends and colleagues at Schlissel, Ostrow, Karabatos & Poepplein will miss him dearly."

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"Q. A recent letter from our managing agent about our co-op's insurance coverage suggested that residents' homeowners' policies include a loss-assessment rider to ''cover certain types of losses incurred by the corporation, which would then be assessed on all shareholders in the form a loss assessment.'' Is the suggested rider necessary, or is it simply a matter of cost shifting by the co-op? A. ''Loss-assessment coverage is automatically included under a cooperative or condominium homeowners' policy,'' said Robert E. Mackoul, the president of Mackoul & Associates, an insurance brokerage in Long Beach, N.Y."

Putin. The police, vastly outnumbering the protesters and wielding night sticks and metal shields, detained about 30 people, the Interfax agency quoted a spokesman as saying. A protest organizer said the number of people detained at the raid was more than 100, plus another 100 who had been arrested in an earlier roundup. Among those detained were several foreign and Russian journalists, including a photographer for The New York Times who was later released."
2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"BOSE--Arun. 73. Bengali artist and art professor at Lehman College for 35 years, died at his home in North Salem, NY on February 7, after a long illness. He is survived by his wife Araceli and a daughter, Rebecca. He will be missed. A painter and a master printmaker, his wide-ranging body of work was rooted in remembrances of his beloved city of Kolkata. He exhibited around the world, and his works are featured in several museums and art collections. He received his art education at the Government College of Art & Craft Kolkata, India; the Ecole Superieur des BeauxArts, Paris -under a French government scholarship where he also studied printmaking with Stanley William Hayter at the prestigious Atelier 17; and Pratt Graphic Center, Manhattan, NY. At that time, 1968, he received the John D. Rockefeller, III Fellowship. He was proud to have been a member of the Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop, NYC. As noted by the Kolkata newspaper The Telegraph -at the time of his retrospective exhibition in 2004 -Arun Bose's legacy as artist and teacher, his very own art expression, will remain that of ''A New Yorker with Bengal in his canvas''."

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"THERE'S nothing wrong with drug makers publicizing their products, but the lure of lucrative government contracts can prompt them to play fast and loose. In lobbying state lawmakers to make its latest vaccine mandatory, Merck has greatly exaggerated both the threat of a disease and the ability of a drug to prevent it. (True, Merck has promised to stop lobbying, but lawmakers and the public are still suffering under misconceptions that the drug company has done nothing to correct.) The drug in question is Gardasil, a vaccine for four types of human papillomavirus, or HPV, two of which are responsible for 70 percent of cervical cancer cases. The Food and Drug Administration approved Gardasil last year for use against HPV in females aged 9 to 26. New Mexico, Texas and Virginia have all recently mandated HPV vaccination for girls, and Connecticut may be next."

Under the stewardship of the coach, John Wooden, now 96, and interviewed here, the Bruins captured an astonishing 12 N.C.A.A. championship titles from 1964 to 1975 and ignited a national fever over college basketball that has yet to cool down. The baby boomers who came of age during that period receive their very own tribute in ''THE BOOMER CENTURY: 1946-2046,'' another documentary, which will appear on PBS on Wednesday at 9 p.m. What more needs to be said of the narcissistic generation? The film doesn't just reflect wistfully on the Woodstock years -- because really, who could stand that? It examines how boomer psychology has shaped the market and the marketplace of ideas, for better and for worse. The great question of how boomers will handle retirement is explored too. Look forward to (or run away from) interviews with Oliver Stone, Erica Jong and Dr. Andrew Weil, among others. You've been aching to see them together again, and, your dream will no longer be denied.

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"CONLIN--Joseph H., 79, New York impresario, died on Monday, March 5, 2007, in West Palm Beach, FL. A kindly, imposing man of great wit, charm, and generosity -and an excellent ballroom dancer who possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of opera and piano repertoire -he suffered an aneurism behind the right knee in May of 2002, which led simultaneously to an amputation and kidney dialysis. With heroic cheerfulness, he continued to support his friends and clients from his electric wheelchair, building up his concert management and travel agency as a legacy for tenor and composer Brian Hunter, his partner for the last 15 years. After graduation from Columbia University, several years at NBC, and a stint in the US Army, he worked for John R. Fitzgerald of Rye Beach, NH, the largest purveyor of novelties in the world. In the 1950s, he established Conlin Associates, which became one of America's premier concert-management firms, responsible for numerous contracts in the U.S. of such European artists as Carlo Bergonzi, Maria Callas, Giuseppe di Stefano, and Ferruccio Tagliavini. Among his list of high-level cultural events were the first American recital of Renata Tebaldi at the Old Met, the American Farewell Concert Tour of the 65-year-old Beniamino Gigli, and the 1955 sensational Carnegie Hall recital of Jussi Bjorling when other presenters were afraid of the great tenor's alcoholism. An expert judge of musical talent, Conlin adjudicated numerous piano and vocal competitions across the country. In the 1980s, he served as general manager of the Palm Beach Opera and executive director of the Chopin Foundation of the US, in Miami."

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"The 52nd Venice Biennale takes place this summer, when the international art world descends on that magical city to examine what's happening in contemporary art. For now the Metropolitan Museum of Art will be exploring the Venice of centuries past. ''VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797,'' which opens on Tuesday and runs through July 8, focuses on this rich exchange of artistic ideas. Arranged chronologically, the exhibition begins in the year when two Venetian merchants stole St. Mark's body from Muslim-controlled Alexandria and took it to Venice. It ends when the Venetian Republic fell to Napoleon. Particularly fascinating will be the part that deals with the 15th and 16th centuries, when the Venetian interest in Islamic culture flourished. One artist, Gentile Bellini, made a diplomatic mission to the court of Sultan Mehmet II between 1479 and 1481 and began incorporating Islamic figures and settings in his paintings. Some pupils, including Vittore Carpaccio and Giovanni Mansueti, copied him. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. Illuminated manuscripts can also be seen at the Morgan Library & Museum. On view through June 17 is ''APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,'' commemorating the completion of a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas'' from 1220, the largest surviving manuscript from a Spanish tradition of illuminated works centered on the Apocalypse. Because the manuscript was unbound for the preparation of the facsimile, 50 of its miniatures can be seen side by side. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. For those curious to see Asher B. Durand's ''Kindred Spirits,'' that much-publicized 1849 Hudson River School landscape, it will be hanging at the Brooklyn Museum starting Friday. The New York Public Library sold the painting to the Wal-Mart heiress Alice L. Walton in a sealed bid auction at Sotheby's two years ago for a reported $35 million. Depicting the painter Thomas Cole and the poet William Cullen Bryant standing on a rocky ledge overlooking the Catskills, it will be the centerpiece of ''KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B.

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"When the AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA played its first concert, in 1977, there was nothing quite like it. This full symphony orchestra was formed to play music by American composers, from Serialists and neo-Romantics to Minimalists (and beyond), and from early-20th-century classics to newly commissioned scores. DENNIS RUSSELL DAVIES, the orchestra's conductor from its founding until 2002, returns Monday to lead a 30th-anniversary program. This typically eclectic venture includes Tania León's ''Indígena,'' as well as a handful of concertos in which the composers are the soloists. They include Steven Mackey's ''Deal'' (for electric guitar), ''Inventions'' by the jazz pianist Vijay Iyer, Kurt Rohde's ''White Boy/Man Invisible'' (for viola), Harold Meltzer's ''Virginal'' (for harpsichord), Andrew McKenna Lee's ''Arabescata'' (for guitar) and Min Xiao-Fen's ''Blue Pipa'' (for the pipa, a Chinese lute). 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to $40. NEW SOUNDS LIVE, the concert hall spinoff of John Schaefer's new-music show on WNYC-FM (93.9), offers a tantalizing mixture of the antique and the modern on Wednesday. TRIO MEDIAEVAL, the Norwegian vocal ensemble, mostly performs very old music, as its name suggests, but also recent works composed for it. Also on the bill is the CRASH ENSEMBLE, an Irish chamber group that will perform two new works by a compatriot, Donnacha Dennehy. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $35 in advance, $40 at the door. The violinist MIRANDA CUCKSON has enlivened many a new-music concert in recent seasons, but there is more to her than that. At a recital on Sunday with THOMAS BAGWELL, the pianist, Ms. Cuckson will play works by Copland, Paul Schoenfield, Schubert and Brahms. 3 p.m., Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (212) 288-8920, mapc.com; $15, $10 for students and 65+. If you're a fan of PAUL MORAVEC's music, you may have to do some sprinting on Thursday: his ''Tempest Fantasy,'' which won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004, is included on a program by the TRIO SOLISTI and the clarinetist ALAN KAY. Works by Mendelssohn and Piazzolla are also on the program. 7:30 p.m., Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $21 in advance, $25 at the door. A few miles south, at Carnegie Hall, the superb flutist MARYA MARTIN is including Mr. Moravec's ''Marya's Song'' in her all-contemporary program, ''The Flute Book of the 21st Century,'' which includes scores by Eve Beglarian, Kenji Bunch, Chen Yi, Melissa Hui, Tania León, Ned Rorem and David Sanford. 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall; $15."

COLBY DAMON. The chamber compositions of the Japanese composer Toshio Hosokawa make up the score, performed live by a flutist, an accordionist and a pianist. That's a lot of bodies, and cultures, for one little stage. But Mr. Veggetti is usually more interested in stillness and space than commotion, and Mr. Damon, a smart, fluid dancer with an exquisite attack, is good at making room for himself. The program, which is part of the Guggenheim's Works and Process series, will include a discussion with Mr. Veggetti and Victoria Morgan, the artistic director of the Cincinnati Ballet, and moderated by Alexandra Munroe, the museum's senior curator of Asian Art. Sunday and Monday at 7:30 p.m., (212) 423-3587, worksandprocess.org; $15 to $24. Another trio of dances can be seen starting Wednesday, as the Juilliard dance division, under the direction of Lawrence Rhodes, presents SPRING DANCES AT JUILLIARD. Sophomore, junior and senior students will be featured in the Twyla Tharp classic ''Deuce Coupe''; Jiri Kylian's 1980 all-male tribute, ''Soldiers' Mass''; and ''Name by Name,'' choreographed by Susan Marshall, a Juilliard alumna. Ms. Marshall's work, for 18 women and set to music by David Lang, is a premiere, but ''Deuce Coupe,'' from 1973, danced to the Beach Boys, is likely to be the real draw. Also featured is the 28-member Axiom ensemble, conducted by George Stelluto, and a men's chorus for Mr. Kylian's piece.

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"Three years after resigning in disgrace, Richard M. Nixon sat down with the British journalist David Frost for a series of interviews in which Nixon came as close as he ever would to a mea culpa. Just think of it: A stubborn president finally shamed into taking responsibility for his mistakes in front of television cameras. It sounds like a fantasy produced by moveon.org, but the new Broadway show ''FROST/NIXON,'' which received rave reviews in its run at the Donmar Warehouse in London and is slated to be turned into a film directed by Ron Howard, has just as much to do with the media as it does with men in power. Mr. Frost, played by Michael Sheen (he was Tony Blair in ''The Queen''), has almost as much on the line as Nixon (Frank Langella) does. And it's not just his journalistic integrity. Mr. Frost, who has seen the play and apparently liked it, paid Nixon $600,000 to join him for the interview, one of the most famous examples of checkbook journalism in history. Previews begin Saturday; the play opens April 22 at Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, Manhattan, telecharge.com; $76.25 to $96.25. ROTOZAZA, a well-regarded avant-garde British company named after a work by the Swiss sculptor Jean Tinguely, produces shows that sound a little like lab experiments by evil scientists. They involve unrehearsed guest performers, who are different every night, following instructions from recorded voices. In ''DOUBLETHINK'' the audience sees how two people, separated by a divider, react differently to the same demand. ''FIVE IN THE MORNING'' places three guests in a swimming pool complex named Aquaworld. These shows have limited runs; see them while you can. ''Doublethink,'' Thursday through April 1, and ''Five in the Morning,'' April 5 through April 8, Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, ps122.org; $20, $10 members.

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"BUT NOT LAST WEEKEND The News -- The last of thousands of stranded air travelers made it home early this week after being marooned around the country when a winter storm struck the Northeast. Behind the News -- Pillow, anyone? The snow, sleet and freezing rain paralyzed airports in the Northeast last weekend and forced the cancellation of more than 3,300 flights. Computer glitches, staffing rules and the sheer volume of bookings because of spring break compounded problems. Travelers slept at airports, crowded into hotels -- or gave up and drove home in rental cars. TO EUROPE, FOR LESS The News -- The European Union's 27 member nations backed a deal with the United States to open up restricted trans-Atlantic aviation routes to new airlines. Behind the News -- The plan will allow European and American airlines to fly any route between any European city and United States city. The change, to take effect next March, is expected to increase competition in Europe and reduce the cost of air travel. The union's transport commissioner, Jacques Barrot, above, predicted it would boost annual trans-Atlantic traffic by 26 million passengers. INTO SPACE The News -- A company that hopes to make access to the cosmos cheaper launched a rocket that reached space before running into trouble and re-entering the atmosphere. Behind the News -- The company, Space Exploration Technologies called the launch from the Marshall Islands a success and said a roll-control problem that developed could be fixed. The company's first attempt to launch its Falcon 1 rocket failed last year. The Internet entrepreneur Elon Musk, who founded the company, says it plans to launch 2 satellites this year. ''Not a perfect day,'' he said of the launch, ''but a good day.'' WITH THE CELLPHONE OFF The News -- The Federal Communications Commission has given up on the idea of allowing in-flight cellphone use, the panel's chairman, Kevin Martin, said. Behind the News -- Air travel already can be tough -- what with the delays, security, tight seating and the, uh, food. A proposal to end the cellphone ban portended an added woe for passengers -- being subjected to a neighbor's high-decibel business deal or personal travails. But Mr. Martin said the wireless telecommunications industry also had an objection -- in-flight calls would interfere with their ground-based networks. AND 800 OTHERS The News -- The Airbus A380, the largest passenger plane in the world, made its debut in the United States. Behind the News -- The $300 million double-decker superjumbo jet is certified to carry up to 853 passengers -- about twice the capacity of the biggest version of the Boeing 747. Its arrival at Kennedy International Airport caused a media stir, but no American carrier has bought the plane. It's expensive, for one thing, and it may just be too big. Even so, said Edmund S. Greenslet, publisher of The Airline Monitor, ''To see it is to be impressed by its sheer magnitude.''"

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"Given the howls of complaint nowadays about the declining quality of feature films, it's easy to forget that we are in the middle of what looks to be a golden age of documentaries. The venerable NEW DIRECTORS/NEW FILMS series, presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art, has always recognized the vitality of the genre. For the second year its ''classics'' sidebar is revisiting 10 of the most resonant documentaries it has screened over the years. For pertinence you can't beat Jehane Noujaim's 2003 ''CONTROL ROOM.'' This film examines the complicated politics and inner workings of the Middle Eastern news agency Al Jazeera, which in the wake of 9/11 was demonized in the United States as a propaganda tool of Islamic jihadists. The reality, however, is more ambiguous. Ultimately the film wonders whether journalistic objectivity is possible at any time, but especially during a war. For those who wonder how realistically Forest Whitaker captured the Ugandan military dictator Idi Amin in ''The Last King of Scotland,'' Barbet Schroeder's 1974 documentary portrait, ''GENERAL IDI AMIN DADA,'' offers an opportunity to compare the man and his Oscar-winning stand-in. Since it was directed partly by the dictator himself, the film is hardly impartial, but in many places it is monstrously funny. When it was first shown in 2003 ''MY ARCHITECT,'' Nathaniel Kahn's exploration of the mysterious life of his father, the architect Louis Kahn, struck a popular chord. A genius who led a double life and whose body was unidentified for two days when he died of a heart attack in Pennsylvania Station in 1974, the architect was a maddening enigma to his son. Besides being an enlightening posthumous profile of an artist, the film is a classic son-in-search-of-father drama, this one nonfiction.

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"WEXLER--Milton. We miss our beloved and unique father, Milton Wexler, who died prematurely at home on March 16, 2007, at the age of 98. A renaissance man, Wexler transformed every boundary he met, from helping launch the Human Genome Project to creating innovative approaches to doing psychotherapy. He befriended and mentored people who changed the face of the arts and sciences. Educated at Syracuse University, he received a law degree from NYU, briefly practicing in Manhattan. He was lured by the tradition-breaking ideas of Sigmund Freud and escaped the law, earning his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Columbia University and completing his psychoanalytic training. After serving in the Navy during World War II, Wexler moved in 1946 to become Chief Psychologist at the Menninger Clinic. At Menningers, he did seminal research on the treatment of schizophrenia as well as practicing psychoanalysis. In 1950, Wexler's world was shattered when each of his wife's three brothers was diagnosed with Huntington's disease (HD), a devastating and inevitably fatal hereditary brain disorder. Wexler moved his family to Los Angeles. He continued to specialize in treating schizophrenia. His practice expanded to include many creative people in all walks of life -artists, architects, actors, writers, businessmen and others. He experimented with group therapy using the combustible energy of the participants to liberate growth. In 1968, another blow struck the Wexler family. Leonore, his wife, was also diagnosed with HD, the same catastrophic neurodegenerative disease that had destroyed her brothers. The Wexlers realized that their daughters, Alice and Nancy, had a 50% risk of going down the same fatal path. Wexler immediately began the Hereditary Disease Foundation, dedicated to finding treatments and cures. He was particularly proud of creating the interdisciplinary Workshop Program that remains the linchpin of the Foundation. Using lessons gleaned from group therapy, Wexler transformed scientific discussions. He restricted the number to a small group of interdisciplinary participants and forbade slides. He realized it was essential for basic and clinical scientists to work together, share and collaborate. He also recognized that senior investigators as well as younger researchers had something unique to offer. His own presence, when he moderated and participated in the workshops, was catalytic. The synergism he created radiated far beyond the Foundation and broke new boundaries. Although by nature optimistic, Wexler was stunned when his team found the location of the HD gene in 1983. When stretched end to end, a single persons DNA spans the globe's circumference. Wexler's team had found the equivalent of one inch on the globe's circumference! This discovery helped launch the Human Genome Project. It meant that the strategies pioneered and proven by his team would work to find any gene. Wexler's team had found a DNA marker extremely close to the HD gene on the top of chromosome 4. Much work needed to be done to isolate the gene in this inhospitable terrain. Wexler formed an international team, encouraging collaboration to find the HD gene. To expedite progress, Wexler brought the Gene Hunters together many times a year for interdisciplinary workshops. He supported the research financially and became a close mentor and friend to over 100 scientists who made up the team. When the gene was discovered, the Gene Hunters published as a group. Spanning 40 years, Wexler served consecutively as President and Chairman of the Board of the Hereditary Disease Foundation. His inspiration changed the face of medical science. Many researchers he mentored are now transforming the world as leaders in academia, government and the private sector. Wexler continued to the end to be elated by advances in biology that draw us closer to treatments and cures. His excitement about science, creativity and the arts was infectious. His prodigious intellect, curiosity, passion and zest for life moved us and added dimensions to our own. His enthusiasm for Trollope, Huckleberry Finn and Benjamin Franklin, as innovators in psychology and science, opened our eyes. His love of writing expressed itself in creating screenplays and novels. We shared the pleasure of seeing some of his screenplay collaborations in cinemas! He finished an autobiography before macular degeneration robbed him of his sight. We miss his warmth, loyalty, empathy and steadfastness as a friend. We miss his astuteness about character, his dignity, and his generosity of soul. He met almost insuperable physical challenges with humor and grace. He was the ''elder of our tribe,'' the bedrock beneath our feet, and the ''helium'' of inspiration. He is irreplaceable and sorely missed. Send donations to the Hereditary Disease Foundation, 3960 Broadway, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10032; www.hdfoundation.org, 212.928.2121."

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"IT'S official: middle schools are a mess. If you didn't already suspect this, a battery of standardized tests, some of which are required under the No Child Left Behind law, have confirmed that in rich and poor school districts alike, reading and math scores drop from fifth to sixth grade, when most students move to middle school. What's worse is that the scores continue to decline through eighth grade, as do students' self-esteem and engagement in school. Sadly, no one seems to know what to do about these schools, which generally serve 11- to 13-year-olds. The solutions that most educators have come up with tend to involve restructuring the schools, including assigning students to fewer teachers during the day, decreasing class size or the school size, or changing the schools to either kindergarten through eighth grade or sixth through 12th grade."

He won the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, not the Navy Medal."

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"The average visit to Atlantic City used to last three hours, and it's not hard to remember why. If you weren't gambling, you weren't losing to the house, and this left casinos little incentive to wine and dine you. Today, of course, all that's changed: the marriage of gambling to dining, shopping and culture has glamorized the casino experience, and over-the-top has become the new run-of-the-mill. Americans, for their part, have embraced the highbrow-lowbrow mishmash of places like Las Vegas and Connecticut's Mohegan Sun, and now a little roulette between shopping at Prada and dinner at Thomas Keller's Bouchon seems like light entertainment on par with seeing Celine Dion. It's a phenomenon that has proved highly lucrative (Ceasars Forum in Las Vegas is North America's highest-grossing shopping area per square foot) and easily exportable, thereby reshaping not only the culture of gaming but also how and where we travel."

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"After a brutal stint of winter, shoppers are clearly in the mood for pineapple? And how. When a shipment of charming ceramic pineapple-shaped scented candles by Harry Slatkin arrived at Bath & Body Works stores two weeks ago, 13,000 of them flew off of the shelves in three days. Apparently, the sweet-tart Pineapple Mango scent combined with the retro Palm Beach look was too much for shoppers to resist. (The reasonable price probably didn't hurt. The small candles are $16.50; the large are $50.) A new harvest has arrived in stores and online, with the small size available in stores in the Sugared Passion Fruit scent as well.

So, though you can't plan on having a heart attack, you can plan on what might happen when you do. But what about going to the theater? Flying or having a baby? Being arrested?

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Shame on Bob Morris (''The Little Puritans,'' The Age of Dissonance, March 11). Instead of chastising his 12-year-old nephew, who expressed concern about his smoking, Mr. Morris should thank him. Yes, children shouldn't set the rules and ''commandeer every conversation,'' but Mr. Morris is selfish. I should know. I said the same thing to my father and uncle 40 years ago, but they didn't listen. Ten years ago, my pipe- and cigar-smoking father died of pulmonary fibrosis. Earlier this month, my uncle had surgery for lung cancer."

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"KRISTIN SOMERS was sitting in her 10th-grade English class at Hackettstown High last year when a call came over the intercom telling her to report to the office. Immediately. An honors student with a 3.8 average here in northwestern New Jersey, she wasn't being summoned to discuss her academic performance. And while she participates in an array of after-school organizations -- from soccer and softball to the National Honor Society and Key Club -- the issue wasn't her extracurricular activities or future plans."

After embellishing oneself from top to toe with the company's signature velour and terry cloth and other not-terribly-subtle clothing and accessories, one must now also be fruitful. (And multiply!) This month, the company introduced Juicy Couture Baby, another recklessly cute variation on the theme. Tiny track suits, terry hoodies and, best of all, cotton kurta sets (at right) come in those same bubble-gum flavors and on-the-fence prices: just expensive enough to make you wince slightly ($48 for a onesie?) but not too dear to keep you from buying rafts of the items anyway ($48 to $118 at Bloomingdale's stores)."

Manager Joe Torre said Saturday that Andy Pettitte and Mike Mussina would not be lined up properly to make the start against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Yankee Stadium.

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"As anyone holding his riddled N.C.A.A. tournament bracket will groan, records of college basketball teams -- 29-5 here, 18-10 there -- are often not what they seem. The collective strength of a team's opponents over a season plays a crucial role in a team's tournament future, by most estimates ranking only behind school colors and Menacing Mascot Index. Baseball, whose season dawns next weekend, as college basketball's sets, rarely hears the term ''strength of schedule'' because its 162 games are trusted to smooth out peaks and valleys. Yet thanks mostly to the increasing complexities of interleague play, some teams can see the 2007 playoff horizon more clearly than others."
2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"AS grime obscures my domain, I see through the window glass darkly. Spring is not really a time of optimistic budding, of vernal renewal. It is the season of grunge. The first bright shafts of light illuminate too much; sunshine exposes streaks, all manner of winter muck. Sitting in the kitchen of my house, I feel the call to battle against dirt. A primitive pride wells up within me, perhaps as the sap rises in the tired bare maples outside my window. I will clean house! I head for the caustic chemicals with a wild glee."

2007-03-25T00:00:00Z,"For decades it seems as if travel guides have stuck to the same old formula. But some new arrivals are out to reinvent the genre. In Taschen's Hotels and More series ($25; www.taschen.com), Angelika Taschen presents her edited version of top city sites (for Paris and London, with Berlin on the way), organized around favorite hotels and lushly illustrated with photography. Taking word of mouth to its logical conclusion is the photographer Ami Sioux. For her new Degree Books series, from Scintilla (about $33; www.scintillalimited.com), she asked locals to draw maps to their favorite places, and then paired each with a photo she took once there. So far she's covered Reykjavik, Iceland (right); Berlin, London, Paris and New York are promised soon. And Moleskine has entered the postmodern era, where the emphasis is on you: part journal, part guidebook, its new City Notebooks ($16.95; www.moleskine.com) let you write your own itinerary, aided by maps, pull-off tabs and room to scribble.

The city would absorb the cost, $261 million a year. The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, proposed the credit on Feb. 15, but it requires the approval of state lawmakers. Flanked by tenant advocates and politicians at a City Hall news conference yesterday, Ms. Quinn said that two-thirds of city residents were renters and that they deserved relief similar to the $400 rebate on property taxes that city homeowners have received each year since 2004. Individual renters with incomes of less than $43,000 and families with incomes of up to $75,000 would be eligible for the credit. Where roommates split the rent, the credit would be evenly divided among them unless they agreed on a different arrangement. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has not said whether he supports the proposal."

Citing data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Census Bureau, Mr. Schumer said that about 91,000 households in New York State, including 53,000 in the New York City metropolitan area, were at risk of foreclosure by the end of 2008, as interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages are reset. At a hearing on Thursday, members of the Senate Banking Committee criticized the Federal Reserve for failing to curb mortgage lending abuses. The chairman, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said that new legislation might not be needed and that excesses could be addressed under existing regulations."

2007-03-26T00:00:00Z,"THE MATCHUP Florida blew out the Bruins in the national title game last season, but these teams are remarkably different. Florida has not improved much as a team, while U.C.L.A. has shown significant strides on offense while still playing with a defensive verve that has become Ben Howland's trademark. Look for the slightly more up-tempo Bruins to pull the upset, ending Florida's back-to-back title hopes. STAR TO WATCH Channeling the success he had at the Final Four last season, Lee Humphrey made seven 3-pointers and scored 23 points against Oregon. U.C.L.A.'s ability to limit his open shots will be a key in Saturday's game, as the Bruins will have to think twice before doubling off him."
2007-03-26T00:00:00Z,"As the clock ticked last week, Democrats and Republicans scrambled to position themselves so they could lay the blame for a late budget at the feet of their opponents. First there was the extraordinary meeting where Governor Spitzer publicly lambasted Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno, below, likening his budget figures to ''three-card monte'' in an effort to portray the Senate as the holdup in budget talks. Next came the one-sided conference committee meetings, which Republicans called to chide Democrats for not publicly negotiating the budget. It was the fiscal version of an empty chair debate, or maybe of one hand clapping."

But it is the phone calls arranged by the alliance -- a joint venture of the Greater New York Hospital Association and a union, 1199 United Healthcare Workers East -- that appear to be getting the most attention from lawmakers. The effort involves ''patch-through'' calling, in which phone bank operators contact voters in a lawmaker's district, ask them if they want to stop the health cuts and then connect them with the lawmaker's office if they say yes."

Bloomberg, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions. The mayor had objected to the governor's move to cut $328 million in unrestricted annual aid to the city. Mr. Spitzer, in conversations with the mayor last week, agreed to restore a small amount of the money in the coming fiscal year, on the order of $20 million, and in the ensuing years to restore most, if not all, of the funding, the person said.

2007-03-26T00:00:00Z,"A pair of bills introduced in the State Senate and Assembly would provide an estimated 1.1 million New York City households with an annual $300 rent credit on their city personal income taxes. The city would absorb the cost, $261 million a year. The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, proposed the credit on Feb. 15, but it requires the approval of state lawmakers. Flanked by tenant advocates and politicians at a City Hall news conference yesterday, Ms. Quinn said that two-thirds of city residents were renters and that they deserved relief similar to the $400 rebate on property taxes that city homeowners have received each year since 2004. Individual renters with incomes of less than $43,000 and families with incomes of up to $75,000 would be eligible for the credit. Where roommates split the rent, the credit would be evenly divided among them unless they agreed on a different arrangement. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has not said whether he supports the proposal.

The men signed up to receive TGN1412, an immune stimulant from a small German concern, and rapidly suffered multiple organ failure, requiring weeks in intensive care. The reaction had not been predicted from animal experiments. Under the guidelines, new high-risk drugs should be given to one volunteer at a time, allowing intervals to check for reactions. They also suggest that monitoring extend long after the initial experiment. In addition, British researchers have questioned conventional animal models, especially for immune molecules or long-acting medicines."

Average one-way international fares continued a four-year climb, to $1,707, and average international daily hotel rates rose for the fifth consecutive year, to $230. Average daily car rental rates crept up again, to $69.

The average air fare rates were calculated from hundreds of domestic and international routes negotiated for corporate clients by American Express, from discount coach to first class. The average rate for car rentals includes fuel, taxes and other charges. Among domestic hotels, average nightly rates rose most sharply in the cheapest niche, the budget category, to $179 in the fourth quarter of 2006 from $150 in the comparable 2005 quarter."

I'll bet they were. Galileo, some 400 years ago, established that a body falls at a rate, and accelerates at a rate, that is not affected by its weight. One would also suppose that a large snowflake would have more air resistance than a smaller one. Not a good science lesson from Science Times! Leonard M. Leiman New York"

It cannot be attributed just to the limitations of frail or faltering national health care systems, but to the world's failure to develop and make available easy and effective TB treatment. Progress in developing new diagnostics, vaccines and drugs for TB is being galvanized by public-private partnerships supported by some philanthropies and governments, but eliminating all forms of TB demands the combined efforts of governments and research, pharmaceutical and health care communities worldwide."

''The court's offer is off the table,'' she said. Lawyers for Busta Rhymes, right, 34, whose real name is Trevor Smith, then rejected an offer by the prosecution of a year in jail on each of two counts of assault, to run concurrently, and a $500 fine on the suspended license charge. Although his lawyers declined comment as they left court, one of them, Robert Kalina, had said that his client had been prepared to accept the initial plea offer. Judge Kennedy set May 8 for the start of the trial. The rapper is accused of beating his former driver, Edward Hatchett, 39, on Dec. 26, and of assaulting a fan after a performance in August on Randalls Island.

But Courtney Solomon, co-owner of After Dark Films, said ''Wristcutters'' may even help prevent suicide: ''The movie takes place in purgatory, and its message is that love is better than suicide.''

According to Nielsen's estimates, the 10-year-old animated series attracted 6 million total viewers at 8:30 p.m., wedged between ''The Simpsons'' at 8 (6.9 million) and ''Family Guy'' at 9 (8 million). Although Fox posted a fourth-place finish in total viewers, it was first among adults 18 to 34. Meanwhile, in the 18-to-49 demographic, CBS outstripped Fox for first place. Because of a significant overrun of CBS's live coverage of the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament in the afternoon, Nielsen's preliminary estimates for its prime-time lineup were unreliable, but the network's overall margin of victory appeared conclusive. ABC's ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' won the 8 p.m. hour with 12 million viewers, but it was followed by low-rated repeats of ''Desperate Housewives'' at 9 (6.5 million) and ''Brothers & Sisters'' at 10 (4.3 million).

Though the reality show was anything but a success -- it spent a much of its run in last place in its time slot -- it was fairly effective as a commercial for the $10 million Broadway production. Producers say the musical has an advance of $8 million, a comfortable sum for a show scheduled to begin performances in July.

A8 Sterner British Warning to Iran Tensions escalated between Iran and the West over 15 Britons held by the Iranians, with Prime Minster Tony Blair warning that the campaign to free them would move into a ''different phase.'' A10 The United States Navy began a major exercise in the Persian Gulf, a move that Bush administration officials said was part of a broader strategy to contain Iranian power in the region. A9 NATIONAL A11-17 Call to Increase M.R.I. Use In Women With Cancer Two reports call for greatly expanded use of M.R.I. scans in women who have breast cancer or are at high risk for it.

Just ask Heidi Heinz, an American who was on one of her frequent business trips as a consultant for the global management company Accenture when she had an epiphany. On a visit to Siberia four years ago, she felt the need to carry a company card that read, in three languages: ''If I get sick do not take me to a local hospital! Call this number instead.'' She realized that she needed to escape that life. And that her way out was to return to Seville, the Spanish city where she had fallen in love -- first, when she was a student 17 years ago, with the city and its laid-back, spontaneous way of life, and later with one of its citizens."

As the one-man race progressed, there was more awe than applause in the stands, as fans put their hands to their foreheads and looked wide-eyed at each other and the clock and back at each other again. Phelps finished with a time of 1 minute, 52.09 seconds."

Others are a little more advanced, like the ones we cook here. What all of these pancakes have in common is a certain off-the-cuff friendliness and flexibility. Once you understand that the batter essentially holds the more important ingredients together, and once you get the hang of what that batter looks like, you're free to start adding food almost at will, as you would with a soup or salad."

The appeals court said the case did not fall within its jurisdiction -- lawsuits brought against the state -- because SNCF is an independent entity. It did not rule on the case itself, brought by two members of the Lipietz family who were put on a train to the transit camp at Drancy near Paris in May 1944. They remained there until the camp was liberated a few months later, and brought the suit in 2001. Thousands of French Jews were transported from Drancy to Nazi death camps.

He ordered a coca light, which made the hostess hesitate for a few seconds until she realized he wanted a Diet Coke. He was waiting to give a lesson on cooking with shellfish (''March, April -- these are the best months for seafood,'' he said), but lunch customers were still lingering in the dining room. Worse, they were still sitting on the tall, comfortable stools at the restaurant's heart -- the horseshoe-shaped counter that surrounds the open kitchen. This counter is Mr. Robuchon's radical way of blurring the line between kitchen and dining room. But it was also holding up the class. These 20 stools (and the 26 seats at tables) are often reserved as long as a month in advance, and Mr. Robuchon didn't want the clatter of a cooking session to distract guests who had waited so long for lunch."

''With late notice'' of the denial, a spokeswoman said, ''time has run out, and it is too late to reconfigure the show.'' They were scheduled to perform in London last night, before appearances in Cardiff, Manchester, Glasgow and Nottingham. The tour is to resume in Dublin on Saturday. Snoop Dogg, 35, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, was arrested last year in a disturbance at Heathrow Airport. In an interview with MTV in Amsterdam, he said, ''They knew I was coming six, seven weeks ago, so they could have denied me access then.'' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it could not comment on individual cases. Rostropovich Celebrated With the Kremlin as the setting, a feeble but pleased Mstislav Rostropovich, the cellist and conductor, was honored last night on his 80th birthday, The Associated Press reported. At a gala celebration in a hall where the decorations resembled cellos, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia presented Mr. Rostropovich with a medal, below, the Order of Service to the Fatherland, after issuing a statement that saluted his accomplishments in music and his efforts on behalf of human rights. In remarks shown on Russian television, Mr. Rostropovich said, ''I feel myself the happiest man in the world.'' Observances of Mr. Rostropovich's birthday took place against a background of concerns about his health. He was hospitalized in February for an unspecified illness, and Russian news media reported that he had spent time in the country's leading cancer hospital.

His departure comes just over a week after The Sunday Times in London reported that he was engaged in a power struggle with the chairman of the gallery's board of trustees, Peter Scott, who was calling for his departure. But a spokeswoman for the National Gallery said Mr. Saumarez Smith had been ''headhunted'' for the Royal Academy position since late last year and added, ''The recent coverage has absolutely nothing to do with this at all.''

A mini-festival presented by the Museum of Modern Art and the Film Society of Lincoln Center, New Directors promises a yearly respite from the same old stuff, and perhaps also from the predictable forms of novelty for its own sake. That promise is kept in the very first moments of ''Congorama,'' a highlight of the program's second half. (This year's New Directors/New Films, which began last Wednesday, continues through Sunday.) Before anything has happened -- before the film's wayward, eccentric characters have been plunged into their hectic adventures; before the sudden appearance of an ostrich on a Quebec highway; before the disastrous product demonstration involving a power line de-icer made of plastic foam coffee cups -- the words ''two years earlier'' appear on the screen."

2007-03-29T13:51:51Z,"The big investment banks are everywhere these days, underwriting public offerings, advising buyers and providing deal financing — often on behalf of the same company. This ubiquity has created some concern when a bank needs to be found to handle a “go shop” provision in a takeover agreement, which essentially creates a window during which the target tries to drum up better offers. The dilemma: Does the desire for a completely independent bank trump the desire for a bank with sufficient resources and relevant experience?"

Lam, one of eight United States attorneys whose dismissals called into question the credibility of the Bush Justice Department.""The distinction between political- and performance-related reasons for removing a U.S. attorney is, in my view, largely artificial,"" Mr. Sampson said in his opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The problem, she writes, is that while air travel is the -- dirtiest choice of transport -- in terms of the emissions that cause global warming, no one has figured out how to square the dramatic rise in air travel with the need to curb carbon dioxide emissions. So we'd like to ask: Have any of you purchased carbon offsets to cover your air travel? How did you choose an offset company and how did you research its green projects?

Here's one: ''When the rich man demands good architecture his neighbors will get it too. The vulgarity of current decoration has its source in the indifference of the wealthy to architectural fitness.'' Take that, Toll Brothers. Still, snarky sentences like those notwithstanding, it is hard to get a pulse going for this, Wharton's first book. Her genius was in the particular, and there's not enough of that here, though you will find acres of type about hanging cornices and when overmantels went out of fashion (in England, in the late 18th century). You don't know, from her own words, for instance, that the place where she and her architect, Codman, hashed out their thesis was Land's End, Wharton's house in Newport, R.I."

2007-03-29T00:00:00Z,"A New Book Club Pick by Oprah Oprah Winfrey has named ''The Road,'' by Cormac McCarthy, right, as her latest book club selection, The Associated Press reported. The novel, published in September by Alfred A. Knopf, is a despairing account of a boy and his father lurching across the cold, wretched, wet, corpse-strewn, ashen landscape of a post-apocalyptic world. In her review in The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, '' 'The Road' would be pure misery if not for its stunning, savage beauty.'' Ms. Winfrey said yesterday: ''It is so extraordinary. I promise you, you'll be thinking about it long after you finish the final page.'' According to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 70 percent of industry sales, ''The Road'' has sold 138,000 copies. A paperback edition of the novel, a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle prize and regarded as a contender for a Pulitzer Prize, was not planned until September, but Vintage Books is publishing one now. Historians Lose 'Da Vinci Code' Appeal The British publisher of the Dan Brown best seller ''The Da Vinci Code'' has prevailed again over the two historians who contended that Mr. Brown plagiarized themes from their book ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' (1982).The Court of Appeal in London rejected their appeal yesterday of a High Court ruling in April that Random House, the British publisher, had not infringed on the copyright of their book, the BBC reported. Both books are based on the theory that Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had a child, and that the bloodline continues to this day. In a statement the authors, Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, said, ''We believed, and still do, that nonfiction authors would suffer and be discouraged from extensive research if it was found that any author could take another's ideas, 'morph' and repackage them, then sell them on.'' Random House was awarded the costs of the appeal, estimated at $589,000, and Mr. Baigent and Mr. Leigh face a legal bill of $5.89 million. Simpson Book To Be Auctioned Rights to the O. J. Simpson book ''If I Did It'' are to be auctioned on April 17 pursuant to a ruling by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Gerald Rosenberg that proceeds from the sale and any subsequent book profits be turned over to the family of Ronald L. Goldman, The Associated Press reported. In the book Mr. Simpson explains how he might have carried out the slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Mr. Goldman. Public outrage led to cancellation of the book and a companion television interview. Mr. Simpson was acquitted of the slayings in a criminal trial, but the Goldman family won a wrongful-death lawsuit against him in 1997 and has been trying ever since to collect a $33.5 million civil judgment. Lukas Award Winners ''The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11'' (Alfred A. Knopf), Lawrence Wright's history of events leading to the destruction of the World Trade Center, has won the $10,000 J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize, the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism and the Nieman Foundation announced. The other winners of this year's J. Anthony Lukas Prize Projects Awards were James T. Campbell, recipient of the $10,000 Mark Lynton History Prize, for ''Middle Passages: African American Journeys to Africa, 1787-2005'' (Penguin Press), and Robert Whitaker, recipient of the $30,000 J. Anthony Lukas Work-in-Progress Award for ''Twelve Condemned to Die: Scipio Africanus Jones and the Struggle for Justice That Remade a Nation,'' to be published by Crown. Mr. Lukas, a journalist and author who won two Pulitzer Prizes, died in 1997. The prizes will be presented by Garrison Keillor on May 8 at Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism. Footnotes Denzel Washington, below, is to produce and perhaps star in ''Journal for Jordan,'' a film inspired by an essay in The New York Times by Dana Canedy, about her fiancé, First Sgt. Charles Monroe King, 48, who was killed in Baghdad in October, a month before finishing his tour of duty, Reuters reported. In the essay, Ms. Canedy, an editor at The Times, wrote of the 200-page journal kept by Sergeant King to impart wisdom to their son, Jordan, who was 5 months old when he saw him during a two-week leave in August. Escape Artists, a production house based at Columbia Pictures, acquired rights to the essay. Crown is to release a book based on the journal.

According to Nielsen's estimates, the debut episode on Tuesday, which ABC called a preview, earned a paltry 6.1 million viewers and a third-place finish in the 10 p.m. hour. (The formal premiere was last night.) The show's ratings were striking, given ABC's strong performance at 9 for the ''Dancing With the Stars'' results show (17.6 million), in which the supermodel Paulina Porizkova became the first celebrity dancer to be eliminated this season. ABC finished the night solidly in second place behind Fox, which led at 8 with ''American Idol'' (26.8 million) and at 9 with ''House'' (22.2 million). (Estimates for ''House'' do not reflect a seven-minute overrun of ''American Idol'' into the 9 p.m. hour.)

The judge, Joel Lazarus, set the trial date after withdrawing a warrant for her arrest, which was issued after she failed to appear for a court date. Defense lawyers told the judge that the notice to Ms. Brown, 27, whose real name is Inga Marchand, had been mailed to an outdated address. She is charged with battery and resisting arrest. In 2004 she was sentenced to probation and anger-management classes after a fight at a nail salon in Manhattan. Knighthood for Bono The Irish rock star Bono, below, became a knight of the British Empire yesterday, The Associated Press reported. ''You have permission to call me anything you want -- except sir, all right?'' he said after the lighthearted ceremony in Dublin at the home of the British ambassador, David Reddaway. ''Lord of lords, your demigodness, that'll do.'' Mr. Reddaway paid tribute to Bono's work as a campaigner against poverty and disease in Africa after asking if he was disappointed that becoming a knight no longer involves a sword or kneeling. ''Please,'' said Bono, his hand on the ambassador's shoulder, ''I wasn't expecting you to kneel.'' Bono, 46, the U2 frontman whose real name is Paul Hewson, was designated a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. He was accompanied by his wife, Ali, and their four children: Jordan, 17; Eve, 15; Elijah, 7; and John, 5, as well as the guitarist the Edge and the bassist Adam Clayton, his band mates. The Dublin-born Bono, who will not be entitled to use the title Sir because he is not a citizen of Britain or of a country in the Commonwealth of former British colonies, dismissed criticism from some Irish nationalists for accepting a British honor. ''I think Britain is great,'' he said. ''And Irish people support British football teams. And Irish bands sign British record labels. And Irish people speak English.'' And Now the Elgins Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis of Greece said yesterday that the pending completion of the new Acropolis Museum and recent repatriation of antiquities from the United States, Sweden and Germany ''evaporate the vague excuses'' for Britain's refusal to return the Elgin Marbles, Reuters reported. Cultural Minister George Voulgarakis expressed confidence that the government's efforts to reclaim the 2,500-year-old reliefs, known in Greece as the Parthenon Marbles and exhibited in the British Museum in London, would someday lead to their return. Their comments came at ceremonies in Athens, where Greece displayed two ancient looted artifacts returned by the Getty Museum in Los Angeles: a fourth-century B.C. Macedonian gold wreath and a sixth-century B.C. marble statue of a woman. Their return was part of a deal to return four objects added to the Getty collection as a result of smuggling and illegal sale.

2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"An off-duty narcotics detective spotted a house fire in Castleton Corners yesterday morning and rescued a 4-year-old boy from the burning building, the police said. The detective, Vincent DiCrescento, was driving past 70 Windsor Road about 5 a.m. when he saw the three-story house burning, the police said. After phoning 911, Detective DiCrescento knocked on doors and alerted residents. Spotting a man calling for help from a third-floor window, Detective DiCrescento used an extension ladder to climb halfway up the building and grabbed the child when the man lowered him from the window. The man and his wife, who were not named by the police yesterday, were later led to safety by firefighters, the police said. The fire was brought under control just before 6 a.m., the Fire Department said."
2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"At the end of ''Meet the Robinsons,'' a new 3-D computer-animated Disney film (loosely based on a popular children's book by William Joyce), the screen is filled with an inspiring quotation from Walt Disney himself. The gist of it is that ''around here'' -- meaning at Disney's entertainment workshop -- not a lot of time is spent looking backward. Instead, the motto is, as it is for some of the characters in the film, ''Keep moving forward.'' In other words, learn from your mistakes. And it seems appropriate that this great man's words appear at the end of this movie, since they implicitly invite you to forget what you have just seen and may even serve as a sort of apology. Whether or not it counts as a mistake -- movies tend to be made on purpose -- ''Meet the Robinsons'' is surely one of the worst theatrically released animated features issued under the Disney label in quite some time."

He is survived by brothers Sol (Doris) of West Palm Beach, FL, and Cleveland, Mort (Mae, deceased) and Al (Joyce); and sister, Marilyn Micohn (Al), all of Cleveland; and numerous nieces and nephews throughout the country. He was preceded in death by a sister, Gertrude Rosenstein (Ben, deceased). Following graduation from John Adams High School, Stark left Cleveland, eventually settling in New York City. Stark is credited with single-handedly creating what is now the multi-billion dollar television and radio station brokerage industry; unheard of and unimagined until envisioned by Stark in the 1950's. Over his 50 year career, he was instrumental in virtually every strategic ownership transaction in the industry. Stark was called upon to broker the transaction that created WNET, the nation's first public television station in 1962. Never working with any more than a personal assistant, his client list spanned a generation of media giants including the Walt Disney Company, RKO, Metromedia, Knight Ridder, Viacom, Taft Broadcasting, Allbrittion Communications, Gannett, The Tribune Company and dozens more. In the 1970's when Wall Street began competing, Broadcast & Cable Magazine listed Stark as having closed over $1 billion in transaction in a single year, more than all of the combined Wall Street media transactions. Howard Stark lived in NY and did business throughout the United States and Europe. He was a world traveler and sophisticated business executive, yet privately he was a modest man, a fine tennis player and raconteur. Howard Stark was devoted to his extended family in both NY and Cleveland. He was a remarkable man who led a remarkable life. Known to all as simply, ''Howard'', his generosity and modesty was only exceeded by his style and wit. He will be deeply missed. Funeral services were private."

Food is on the menu, and plenty of it: Cajun specialties, like boudin, corn-and-crab bisque and crawfish pie. There will be sweet tea, soda pop and bloody marys. And on every table, there will probably be all six flavors of Tabasco sauce. But for the McIlhennys, this is no idle condiment to spice up bland food. This is business."

He was born February 28, 1922 in Paterson, NJ. Thompson joined the Naval Air Corp in 1942. He flew 125 reconnaissance missions aboard the B-24 Liberator, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, three Air Medals and a Gold Star. In 1946 he began his sales career with Diebold, Inc. In 1955, Thompson became national Sales Manager of Oxford Filing Supply Company. He served Oxford for 25 years, spearheading the development of the now legendary Pendaflex hanging folder. Named President of Oxford in 1969 and ultimately Chairman and CEO in 1975, Thompson also served as President of the National Office Products Association and as Chairman of the manufacturing division in 1969. After the company was sold to Esselte, Inc., Thompson served four years as President of CEO of Boorum and Pease Company in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Upon his retirement, Thompson mentored inner city youth in Newark, NJ, played a key role in the development of the business library at CW Post University and served on the Regional Advisory Board of the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. He was a member of the Chatham Fish and Game Protective Association. Mr. Thompson is survived by his wife Nancy, sister Eleanor, sons Dana, Laurance, and Woodman, daughter Eleanor, stepdaughters Wendi Sue Palone and Laurie Williams, six grandchildren and six stepgrandchildren.

Directed by Peter Miller Not rated; 81 minutes This feature filmmaking debut by Peter Miller (a PBS veteran and longtime collaborator of Ken Burns) hews to standard television documentary format: archival photographs and talking heads. But the movie's meat-and-potatoes style seems less a failure of imagination than a means of putting in the foreground its subject matter: the tale of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, Italian immigrants and outspoken anarchists charged with the 1920 robbery of a Massachusetts shoe factory and the murder of two of its employees."

On April 11, with a performance by the English singer Lily Allen, below, it will be inaugurated as the Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, as part of a plan by its owner, Live Nation, to attach the Fillmore name -- after the club in San Francisco and its short-lived New York annex, which closed in 1971 -- to a series of midsize clubs around the country, the company announced. Some traditions and design elements of the Fillmore will be added to the Irving Plaza space, like chandeliers and vintage posters on the walls. The club's dressing rooms will be renovated, as will the balcony to provide better sightlines. ''It's more than decorative,'' Bruce Eskowitz, Live Nation's chief executive for North American music, said of the changes. The Theater of Living Arts in Philadelphia is to be renamed the Fillmore Philadelphia next month, and other clubs around the country will follow, Live Nation said. BEN SISARIO"

2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''A Road Trip Back to the Future'' (March 23): I was amazed to read that Tracey Towers in the Bronx had been designed by a renowned architect, Paul Rudolph. As a teenager in the early 1970s, I lived near those monstrosities and went to Bronx Science, which is just down the street from the structures. My friends and I had no idea we were witnessing great architecture being erected. We just complained about how ugly they were and wondered who would live in such dark, foreboding buildings that seemed to have so few windows. I distinctly remember sitting in math class gazing out at them and thinking, ''There goes the neighborhood. Ruth Raskin Scarsdale, N.Y."
2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"Chase, a fourth grader, is skilled at pushing buttons, particularly those on his new video game, Marathon to Mars. But before long he's all too adept at pushing other buttons too: his parents', his science teacher's, even his friends'. Chase's predicament unfolds in the aptly titled musical ''The Game Boy,'' whose plot hums along to the blips, beeps and ice-cream-truck tinkling of a software adventure. Presented by Vital Children's Theater, it captures the allure of video games but doesn't make anyone's eyes glaze over. Adults won't be bored by the action, and children won't be so distracted by it that they miss the authors' gentle satire. (At least most won't be; when I attended, one mesmerized theatergoer anxiously hissed, ''Press up!'' when Chase was on the verge of digital annihilation.)"

Preliminary overnight numbers from local television markets indicate that the half-hour results show at 9 p.m. gave Fox an easy victory for the night. In second place, CBS's lineup of repeats following ''Jericho'' at 8 bested ABC and NBC, which tied for third. The Discovery Channel's three-hour premiere of its 11-part series, ''Planet Earth'' reached 12 million viewers Sunday, earning the network its highest household rating in 18 months. And NBC's ''Saturday Night Live,'' with the Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning as host, posted its best results among adults 18 to 49 in more than a year, averaging 7.9 million total viewers.

2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"Thirty-five years ago the guitarist Jim Hall, above left, and the bassist Ron Carter, above right, released ''Alone Together,'' the chronicle of an engagement at the old Playboy Club in New York. A study in effortless economy and subtlety, the album has long been a testament to their collaboration, which has since been repeated only infrequently. (They last performed together a decade ago.) It's a modest sort of landmark: after the springiest of welcomes, Sonny Rollins's calypso ''St. Thomas,'' it ambles through a handful of other themes, most just as untroubled and familiar. Along the way Mr. Hall finds myriad opportunities to practice his brand of humble virtuosity, and Mr. Carter takes quietly adventurous harmonic flights. They both sound superbly relaxed, whether engaging in improvisational dialogue -- the two-chorus solo portion of ''Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise'' consists entirely of back-and-forth exchanges -- or easing their way together through a theme. On ballads, including the title track, they wisely maintain a lightly strolling tempo; their nonballads employ much the same feeling, but at a brisker clip. There's no great range of volume or tempo, in other words, but the bright rapport enlivens the enterprise, keeping each song distinct from the rest. And along with the menu of standards come a surprise or two, like ''Receipt, Please,'' a postbop ditty by Mr. Carter, and an aptly named piece by Mr. Hall, ''Whose Blues?'' Of course it's unfortunate that ''Alone Together'' is currently out of print; the good news is that it can easily be found through various online sources, including the iTunes Music Store. Even better, Mr. Hall and Mr. Carter have decided to give their partnership another whirl next week at the Blue Note. Given that both musicians have sounded wonderful and wise in recent weeks, the sequel could well outdo the original. (Tuesday through April 8 at 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.) NATE CHINEN"

He attended Culver Military Academy and then Central Methodist University in Missouri. He became chairman of Minch Transit Company in 1987, vice president of Bay Farms Corporation in 1985 and vice president of Mid-Florida Hotels Corporation in 1990. He and his sister Jessica oversee Kinsman Farm, the family's thoroughbred racing property in Ocala, Fla. He is responsible for horse matings and for choosing trainers. He was involved in the Yankees' brief venture into automobile drag racing. He and his wife, Joan, live in Clearwater, Fla. Harold Z. (Hal) Steinbrenner At 38, the youngest of the children, he is beginning his 17th season with the Yankees, his 12th as a general partner. He is also the chairman and chief executive officer of the family-owned Steinbrenner Hotel Properties. He supervises the Yankees' 49 percent financial interest in the Class A Staten Island Yankees, who have won the New York-Penn League championship the past two years. After graduating from the Culver Military Academy, which his father and grandfather attended, he earned a bachelor's degree from Williams College in 1991 and a master's in business administration from the University of Florida (Warrington) in 1994. He and his wife, Christina, live in Tampa, Fla. Jennifer Swindal Like her sister, she graduated from Culver Girls Academy. She earned a bachelor's degree in business from the University of North Carolina in 1981. She is now on the university's Board of Visitors, which advises the Board of Trustees. After college, she worked for a short time in the Yankees' public relations office, but later indicated that chauvinism turned her away. She told The New York Times in 2004: ''Even if I wanted to move up in the organization, I would've never been allowed. Not in this family.'' On Tuesday, after 23 years of marriage, she filed for divorce from Stephen W. Swindal, a general partner of the Yankees and, at least for now, the designated successor to George Steinbrenner III as head of the Yankees' organization. She is 47, with two grown children, and lives in Tampa. Jessica Lopez She is 43, with a sociology degree from Sweet Briar, a women's college in Virginia. There, she competed for the equestrian team, studied creative writing and published her first children's book. She and her brother Hank manage the 750-acre Kinsman Farm in Ocala, Fla. The layout has 35 broodmares and 25 thoroughbreds in training. Its best-known horse was Bellamy Road, who finished seventh in the 2005 Kentucky Derby as the 5-2 favorite. In 1987, she married Joseph Molloy, who joined the Yankees' organization that year (he has since left) after teaching high school science and physical education in Tampa. They had four children. They were divorced in 1997, and she is now married to Felix M. Lopez Jr. They live in Tampa. Felix M. Lopez Jr. This is Lopez's third season as senior vice president of the Yankees. He oversees operations at the Legends Field spring training base in Tampa, the nearby minor league development complex and the Class A Tampa Yankees. Lopez, who will turn 53 on Sunday, was born in Havana and moved to Tampa when he was 15. He is a graduate of the Cam Tech School of Construction, and before joining the Yankees he owned the commercial construction company Architecture Design Construction. FRANK LITSKY"

(Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BLINDNESS' Joe Tantalo's adaptation of José Saramago's best-selling novel, about an unnamed city struck with an inexplicable epidemic of ''white blindness,'' is set in a cell-like space surrounded by white scrim. This setting and the mostly strong acting drive home the fearful basic circumstances. Unfortunately, the script also streamlines Mr. Saramago's reflective story to the point of draining it of moral complexity (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jonathan Kalb) 'CHICKEN' Michael Batistick's new play about cock fighting and emasculation could benefit from subtler metaphors but manages to touch us gently even as it deploys a heavy hammer. E J Carroll, Michael Imperioli and his ''Sopranos'' castmate Sharon Angela give fine performances as struggling urban nobodies (1:45). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Ginia Bellafante) 'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic. (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FUGUE' ''Mary Smith'' is found wandering the streets of Chicago, suffering from amnesia. A young psychiatrist, who has his own demons, is consulted, and the process of treatment and Mary's memories in flashback are the action of ''Fugue,'' Lee Thuna's unrewarding play, directed by the Tony-winning actress Judith Ivey (2:15). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) * 'JACK GOES BOATING' Bob Glaudini's gentle comedy about pothead losers in love is a reminder of how engrossing uneventful lives can be in the hands of the right actors. Peter DuBois directs the easygoing ensemble, brilliantly led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley) * 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Isherwood) 'LOS ANGELES' Julian Sheppard's play about a gamin lost in a Hollywood of aimlessness and empty sex is as thin as the slip dress she keeps wearing and, presumably, taking off (1:20). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'OUR LEADING LADY' Kate Mulgrew stars as Laura Keene, who was starring in ''Our American Cousin'' the night Lincoln was shot, in Charles Busch's uneven new comedy. An occasionally lively but mostly lumpen tribute to the glamour and grit of the theatrical life of a past era (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'PROMETHEUS BOUND' With a splendid performance by David Oyelowo, this is a smart revival of Aeschylus' 2,500-year-old play, rich in poetic imagery. It still has things to say about the abuse of power by an autocratic ruler who vindictively runs roughshod over anyone who disagrees with him (1:20). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) 'SOME MEN' Terrence McNally's hit-and-miss comedy about gay life is a parade of cleanly drawn types, zippy one-liners and sentimental set pieces, woven into a pageant of the ages à la ''Cavalcade,'' Noel Coward's generations-spanning tribute to the British stiff upper lip. Trip Cullman directs the agile, appealing cast (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'TALL GRASS' Brian Harris's three short plays, black farces all, are not nearly as slight as any sound-bite synopsis would have them seem. Here Mr. Harris, a former stock analyst, explores the alliances formed between love and brutality in scenarios in which the tension builds to culminating shock (1:30). The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'TEA AND SYMPATHY' The specter of the Ted Haggard scandal hangs over the Keen Company's revival of Robert Anderson's 1953 play about life in a psychologically stifling boys' boarding school. Girded by Jonathan Silverstein's skillful, understated direction, the play attains an unexpected timeliness as it evolves into a story about the dangers of sexual repression (2:00). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) 'WIDOWERS' HOUSES' An adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's play, updated to 1990s Harlem, tests the limits of credibility (1:40). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) Off Off Broadway 'THE EXILES' Theodora Skipitares's rendering, with life-size puppets, music and video, of the story of Orestes, adapted from Euripides but inspired by Sartre. A short and rather slight play that continues the mining of the Trojan War for contemporary equivalents by the conceiver and director of last season's Trilogy (1:00). La MaMa Annex, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Moore) 'JACKIE WITH A Z': Delectably outrageous (1:30). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'MEN OF STEEL' This darkly comic twist on superheroes is a loony, guilty pleasure (2:00). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE DIRECTOR' A likable if naïve young woman, who is seduced by an unnamed, unseen and presumably unscrupulous film director, seeks other of his victims and tape records their experiences for no clear purpose in a play that has no clear idea of what it wants to say (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) 'MY TRIP TO AL-QAEDA' Lawrence Wright, author of a deeply researched book about the rise of Islamic terrorism, conducts a theatrical seminar about the events leading to the horror of 9/11. He combines a linear narrative of the development of Al Qaeda with reminiscences about the experience of writing the book. Absorbing, and chilling too (1:30). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' A joyful treat (1:30). JCC in Manhattan, Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Van Gelder) * 'THE TAMING OF THE SHREW' AND 'TWELFTH NIGHT' In these boisterous and inventive productions, from the London-based all-male Propeller Company, the poetry may be pretty, but the comedy definitely is not. The director Edward Hall uncovers the baleful underbelly in Shakespearean slapstick, memorably demonstrating that boys will be brutes. (Each is 2:40.) Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE WAITING ROOM' An amusing play about some uncomfortable truths a group of friends and relatives faces while sitting in a hospital waiting room. While it has its share of laughs, it has things to say about the importance of family, even those members you might wish were not a part of it (2:00). 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Hampton) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AIR GUITAR NATION' (R, 82 minutes) Alexandra Lipsitz's breezy competition documentary follows pantomiming would-be rockers as they compete for the right to represent their country in a global championship based in Oulou, Finland. The movement, such as it is, aims to unite a war-torn planet in musical fantasy and to rawwwwwwk! -- but not necessarily in that order. Stylistically, it's nothing special, but the film's droll humor and wild performances are hard to resist. (Matt Zoller Seitz) * 'BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON' (R, 92 minutes) Scott Glosserman's mockumentary about a celebrity-seeking serial killer is sustained by rapier-sharp observations and a firmer grasp of tone than that in many more generously financed projects. Appealing more to the brain than to the gut, the movie subtly prods at the sick dance between the news media and über-criminals without belaboring its point or lowering its tone. If Christopher Guest ever turned his attention to psycho killers instead of folk singers and dog breeders, this is exactly the sort of movie he would make. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'BOY CULTURE' (No rating, 88 minutes) Q. Allan Brocka's absorbing drama follows an emotionally repressed gay hustler (Derek Magyar) as he rebels against the obsessions of his culture -- grooming, cruising, working out -- and a powerful attraction to his roommate. Only when he takes on a reclusive and much older client is he forced to pay attention to a story other than his own. (Catsoulis) 'COLOR ME KUBRICK' (No rating, 90 minutes) If it doesn't add up to more than a fitfully amusing collection of comic sketches, the fictional portrait of Alan Conway, a real-life British con man who hustled his way across England by impersonating the reclusive filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, is a platform for John Malkovich to burst into lurid purple flame. (Stephen Holden) 'DEAD SILENCE' (R, 90 minutes) In this new film from the makers of the ''Saw'' series, a young man (Ryan Kwanten) whose wife was murdered by a demonic ventriloquist's dummy returns to his hometown to unravel the roots of a century-old curse. The film's playfully self-aware touches (like a grand old theater named the Guignol) distract from its leaden pacing, three too many final twists and various behavioral idiocies. (Seitz) 'EXTERMINATING ANGELS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in French) The French director Jean-Claude Brisseau's film is a piece of highbrow smut about a French filmmaker directing a piece of highbrow smut. A must for fans of highbrow smut. No complaints here. (A. O. Scott) 'FIRST SNOW' (R, 101 minutes) Guy Pearce, in his ''Memento'' mode, is a fast-talking salesman in this moody little thriller, which asks metaphysical questions about fate, death and fortunetelling. (Holden) 'THE HILLS HAVE EYES 2' (R, 89 minutes) Wes Craven's 1977 film, ''The Hills Have Eyes,'' in which suburbanites battled mutant cannibals, was a pulpy parable of the thin line separating civilization from savagery. Last year's remake was basically the same movie with glossier production values and a less satirical, more bludgeoning approach to violence. This follow-up, in which National Guard trainees are trapped on a former atomic test site and are stalked by flesh-eating freaks headquartered in a warrenlike mountain hideout, is essentially a catalog of transgressive images, lighted and edited like a heavy-metal video. (Seitz) * 'THE HOST' (R, 119 minutes, in Korean) A loopy, feverishly imaginative genre hybrid -- part carnival of horrors, part family melodrama -- about the demons that haunt us from without and within. The talented South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho directs his monster and humans with equal flair. (Manohla Dargis) 'I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE' (R, 94 minutes) An unusually smart and brisk comedy of marital frustration and sexual temptation, based on Eric Rohmer's ''Chloe in the Afternoon,'' with Chris Rock (who directed and is co-author of the script) as a Manhattan investment banker distracted by the charms of a bombshell played by the wonderful Kerry Washington. (Scott) * 'INTO GREAT SILENCE' (No rating, 162 minutes, in English and Latin) Philip Gröning's documentary about the lives of Carthusian monks living in a valley in the French Alps is slow, quiet and utterly spellbinding for the way it conveys the experience of spiritual devotion in simple, lovely images. (Scott) * 'JOURNEY FROM THE FALL' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Vietnamese and English) The writer and director Ham Tran's film is a sprawling tearjerker about a war-splintered South Vietnamese family trying to survive the aftermath of the United States withdrawal, then seek a new life in America. Set amid the chaos of late-'70s Vietnam, when the victorious North set about ''re-educating'' the shattered South, ''Journey'' recounts one family's endurance in a sturdy, old-movie style, with sweeping camerawork, a monumental and occasionally intrusive orchestral score, gorgeous yet forbidding natural vistas and enough shocking tragedies, brazen escapes and crowd-pleasing acts of defiance to fuel several action-adventure pictures. (Seitz) 'THE LAST MIMZY' (PG, 94 minutes) This overstuffed yet warmhearted sci-fi drama follows a pair of wide-eyed siblings as they solve the riddle of a box from the future. Despite leaden direction (by the New Line Cinema honcho Robert Shaye) and a story crammed with pseudoscientific flotsam -- including palm reading, levitation and telepathy -- this wholesome entertainment doesn't talk down. Nevertheless, a film gazing this far into the future shouldn't be quite so unwilling to look beyond the frame. (Catsoulis) * 'OFFSIDE' (PG, 93 minutes, in Persian) The Iranian director Jafar Panahi follows a group of young woman into a Tehran soccer stadium, where they have come to see their nation's team compete for a spot in the World Cup. Instead they are arrested -- women are forbidden to attend sporting events in Iran -- and their predicament yields comedy as well as a trenchant critique of gender politics in the Islamic Republic. (Scott) 'THE PAGE TURNER' (No rating, 85 minutes, in French) A pretty young thing slithers into the bosom of a bourgeois family like an asp in this shivery little thriller from the French filmmaker Denis Dercourt. Not Chabrol, but not bad, either. (Dargis) * 'PRIDE' (PG, 104 minutes) The Zimbabwean-born filmmaker Sunu Gonera's directorial debut, ''Pride,'' about a swim coach (Terrence Howard, star of ''Hustle & Flow'') leading an urban recreational center's swim team to a championship, about 1971, is a silk ascot wrapped around an ear of corn. But when sinewy young idealists glide through water to the tune of ''I'll Take You There,'' the heart still swells. (Seitz) 'THE PRISONER OR: HOW I PLANNED TO KILL TONY BLAIR' (PG-13, 72 minutes) In 2003 an Iraqi journalist, Yunis Khatayer Abbas, was roused from his Baghdad bed by American soldiers and eventually hauled off to Abu Ghraib. Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein tell his story through newsy video images, talking-head interviews, comic-book-style illustrations and a sympathetic lens. (Dargis) 'REIGN OVER ME' (R, 124 minutes) Mike Binder's comic drama of post-9/11 grief is wildly uneven -- by turns insightful and grindingly mawkish. Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler are two college buddies who reunite, somewhat improbably, some years after the attacks that robbed one of them of his family. The actors rise above the material, particularly in the longer, looser scenes that allow their contrasting temperaments -- Mr. Cheadle's tense understatement and Mr. Sandler's shaggy emoting -- to find a workable syncopation. (Scott) 'SHOOTER' (R, 126 minutes) Muscles bulge, and heads explode in this thoroughly reprehensible, satisfyingly violent entertainment about men and guns and things that go boom. Antoine Fuqua directs, and Mark Wahlberg entertains, with and without his shirt. (Dargis) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) 'TMNT' (PG, 90 minutes) Spawned by sludge and grandiosely named after Renaissance artists, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been rechristened ''TMNT'' and redrawn by an army of computer-generated-imagery specialists. A strange blend of the futuristic and the ancient, this fourth outing finds them hunting 3,000-year-old monsters. But while the turtles may look prettier, they are no smarter; our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof. (Catsoulis) * 'THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY' (No rating, 127 minutes) Stringent, serious history from Ken Loach, in which the Irish uprising and Civil War of the early 1920s test the loyalties and consciences of two brothers, played by Cillian Murphy and Padraic Delany. (Scott) * 'ZODIAC' (R, 158 minutes) David Fincher's magnificently obsessive new film tracks the story of the serial killer who left dead bodies up and down California in the 1960s and possibly the '70s, and that of the men who tried to stop him. Set when the Age of Aquarius disappeared into the black hole of the Manson family murders, ''Zodiac'' is part police procedural, part monster movie, a funereal entertainment that is a testament to this cinematic savant's gifts. (Dargis) Film Series NEW DIRECTORS/NEW FILMS (Tonight through Thursday) Now in its second and final week, this 36th annual installment of a festival devoted to ''emerging'' filmmakers and sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art continues at MoMA and the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. Highlights this week: ''The Great World of Sound'' (tonight at MoMA, tomorrow and Sunday at Walter Reade), Craig Zobel's satire about the industry that has grown up to feed contestants to reality shows like ''American Idol''; ''Day Night Day Night,'' a new film by the New York filmmaker Julia Loktev (''Moment of Impact'') that follows a nameless girl around Manhattan as she prepares for her mission as a suicide bomber (tonight at Walter Reade, tomorrow at MoMA); ''The Other Half,'' a Chinese film directed by Ying Liang, in which an ambitious young businesswoman's life is complicated by her aggressively antisocial boyfriend (tomorrow at Walter Reade, Sunday at MoMA). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $12. (Dave Kehr) 'SEVERANCE' (Monday) For their ''Bizarro Mondays'' program at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater in the East Village, the editors of the horror fan magazine Fangoria this week have chosen Christopher Smith's 2006 ''Severance,'' a British film that seems to have been conceived as a cross between ''The Office'' and ''Hostel.'' A group of disgruntled employees of an international arms company are invited for a weekend retreat at a lodge in the Balkans, but fall into the sadistic hands of a group of crazed, sadistic veterans of the recent conflicts. Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village, (212) 591-0434, twoboots.com/pioneer; $10. (Kehr) JACQUES TATI RETROSPECTIVE (Tuesday) Two of the more rarely screened films of this brilliant French comic filmmaker. First is the recently rediscovered and restored color version of Tati's first feature, the 1949 ''Jour de Fête,'' in which a provincial postman (Tati) tries to apply American efficiency methods; it's followed by ''Trafic,'' the 1971 film that Tati made partly to recover the huge financial losses of his masterpiece ''Playtime.'' For Tati, it's relatively conventional, but still quite an innovative and entertaining work. French Institute-Alliance Française, Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6100, fiaf .org; $9. (Kehr) 'UGETSU' (Tonight through Sunday) This yearlong program of 35-millimeter prints from the Janus Films collection continues with noontime screenings of Kenji Mizoguchi's eerie 1953 ghost story of a peasant potter whose path through the civil wars of 16th-century Japan leads him to the estate of a mysterious noblewoman, who is not what she seems. After ''Roshomon,'' this was one of the first Japanese films to gain a reputation in the West, and it remains a transcendent masterpiece. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. CHRISTINA AGUILERA, PUSSYCAT DOLLS, DANITY KANE (Thursday) Frau Farbissina of the ''Austin Powers'' movies said it best: ''Send in the Fembots!'' Ms. Aguilera may have the most virtuosic voice of her generation of bubble gum pop stars, but as she showed with her endless, melismatic protraction of James Brown's ''It's a Man's Man's Man's World'' at the Grammys last month, she can sometimes seem like a singing robot gone berserk. Her tour includes a hit burlesque girl group (the Pussycat Dolls) and an imitation hit burlesque girl group (Danity Kane). At 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $57 and $97. (Ben Sisario) HOSSEIN ALIZADEH AND THE Hamavayan Ensemble (Tomorrow) One of the most celebrated Iranian classical musicians, Mr. Alizadeh is a former conductor and soloist with the Iranian National Orchestra of Radio and Television.

Anti-Social Music, a collective of 11 New York musicians who play in various pop and new-music bands -- including some big ones, like the Hold Steady -- is one of a handful of groups that go boldly into this realm, playing works for strings, woodwinds and the like. Skeptics, note: it can get pretty rowdy. With Capital M. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $10. (Sisario) BLACK DICE (Wednesday) Noise, noise, glorious New York noise. Black Dice, from Brooklyn, is a big player in the international avant-rock scene, and has remained vital by staying truly experimental: whether playing spacey, hokey psychedelia or alien-invasion squalls of feedback, the band throws itself deeply into its every unpredictable turn. With Ocrilim and No Age. At 8 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com or toddpnyc.com; $8. (Sisario) * BLOC PARTY, ALBERT HAMMOND JR. (Tonight and tomorrow night) With spiky but melodic guitars and agitated dance beats, Bloc Party revives the nervous punk-funk of bands like Gang of Four. Its latest, ''A Weekend in the City'' (Vice), is a concept album about life in London after the 2005 transit bombings. Albert Hammond Jr., the rhythm guitarist of the Strokes, has a new solo record, ''Yours to Keep'' (Scratchie/New Line), whose sunshine shows that crisp guitar classicism need not exist solely in the dark behind Manhattan's velvet ropes. With Sebastien Grainger. At 8, United Palace Theater, 4140 Broadway, at 175th Street, Washington Heights, (212) 307-7171, bowerypresents.com; sold out.

(Sisario) THE BOOKS (Tonight) Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong of the Books make beguiling electronic collages out of disembodied vocal samples, a few notes from a banjo and unclassifiable sounds that fade in and out like traffic. Part of the pleasure of listening is trying to figure out just why all this chaos works so wonderfully and wittily. At 7, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; free with museum admission. (Sisario) Barbara Carroll (Sunday and Monday) Elegant, witty and touching, this classically trained jazz pianist and singer, now 82, is in her prime: the female counterpart of Bobby Short.

(Stephen Holden) * TOUMANI DIABATÉ'S SYMMETRIC ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Mr. Diabaté, the Malian kora master, plays regular gigs back home in Bamako with this 30-odd-piece big band, mixing ancient songs with salsa-infused funk. Last year he made an excellent album with this group, ''Boulevard de l'Indépendance'' (World Circuit/Nonesuch), and he leads it in its New York debut tonight at 10, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $42. (Sisario) DIPLO, BONDE DO ROLE (Tonight) Diplo, born Wesley Pentz -- his stage name is taken from diplodocus, a dinosaur -- is the influential and eclectic D.J. who has worked with the Sri Lankan-British rapper M.I.A., and is half of Hollertronix, a mixtape team from Philadelphia. He has been borrowing from Brazilian baile funk for years, and the first release on his new record label, Mad Descent, is by the Brazilian group Bonde do Role.

DOG, O'DEATH (Thursday) Dr. Dog, from Philadelphia, takes a jam-band approach to high-energy rhapsodies that recall ''Abbey Road''-era Beatles. The New York band O'Death draws from the bluntness and spiritual purity of Appalachian folk, the menace of punk and the rowdy theatricality of Tom Waits, jumbling sacred and profane. With Doublehorse. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door.

At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $54 to $74. (Sisario) HELLA, DIRTY PROJECTORS (Tonight and tomorrow night) It's impossible to find the center of a Hella song, which explodes in multidirectional streaks of percussion and squawky guitar like a Jackson Pollock painting. Long a guitar-drum duo, the group recently expanded to five members. Dirty Projectors, led by Dave Longstreth, builds elaborate ''glitch operas'' with stark pluckings of guitar and strings, and precise, ecstatic harmonies, all arranged slightly out of whack. Tonight at 9, Europa, 98-104 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $12.

(Sisario) CHRIS KNIGHT (Thursday) Cold-eyed drifters, crooked yet sentimental cops, and prostitutes who kill their johns are characters in the brutal, deadpan songs of Chris Knight, a country singer from Kentucky whose oeuvre resembles Bruce Springsteen's album ''Nebraska'' set in the South. At 8 p.m., Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario) LAND OF TALK (Tuesday through Thursday) Riding a wave of blog buzz, this young Montreal band, recalling Dinosaur Jr. and P J Harvey with tangles of grungy guitar and opaque but affecting lyrics, makes a sweep through the clubs.

(Sisario) * LCD SOUNDSYSTEM (Tonight and tomorrow night) Tim Murphy's perfect, punk-edged disco in LCD Soundsystem -- sharp and sexy but unapologetically silly, retro but smartly innovative -- has roots across the dance-rock map but is unmistakably a product of New York. (''Those of you who still think we're from England/We're not,'' he sings with nasal congestion and typical wryness on ''North American Scum.'') The group celebrates a brilliant new album, ''Sound of Silver'' (Capitol), with two shows at the Bowery Ballroom. At 9, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) Marilyn Maye (Tomorrow and Sunday) This too-seldom-seen jazz belter, now in her mid-'70s, folds Anita O'Day-style swing and chesty Margaret Whiting-like belting into a musical jelly roll with a bittersweet Judy Garland filling. Tomorrow at 7 and 10:30 p.m., Sunday at 7 and 9:30 p.m., Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; $25 cover, two-drink minimum.

(Sisario) 'THE MUSIC OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN' (Thursday) Like the Bob Dylan tribute at Lincoln Center a few months ago, this concert, a benefit for the Music for Youth Foundation, gathers a starry group: Steve Earle, Jewel, M. Ward, Josh Ritter, Joseph Arthur, Badly Drawn Boy, Juliana Hatfield, the Holmes Brothers, Elysian Fields, Uri Caine, Odetta and Ronnie Spector, among others. Mr. Dylan didn't show up at his tribute. Will Bruce Springsteen? At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $150. (Sisario) LES NUBIANS (Sunday) The French tried but failed to smooth out African music completely. Les Nubians, two sisters from Cameroon, harmonize in cosmopolitan rhythm-and-blues that Erykah Badu fans would appreciate; they move among smooth soul crooning à la Sade, rapping in French and hints of both American funk and Cameroonian traditions. At 8 and 10 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $26 in advance, $28 at the door (sold out at 8). (Pareles) PERE UBU (Tuesday) In the mid-'70s, while bands like the Dead Boys and the Ramones were perfecting the narrow sonic attack that came to be known as punk, Pere Ubu, from Cleveland, was playing a dissonant, urgent and deeply idiosyncratic variation centered on the sung-spoken vocals of David Thomas. With Golden Error and Beat the Devil. At 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario) SIN-É (Tonight through Sunday) It's never easy to see a good New York rock club go down, but it's especially painful when it happens to the same place twice. In the late 1980s and early '90s, Sin-é, on St. Marks Place in the East Village, was a cozy coffeehouse frequented by singer-songwriters like Jeff Buckley; its new home on the Lower East Side will be shutting down after Sunday night. Tonight is the singer-songwriter Citizen Cope, whose bluesy drawl is delivered over leisurely hip-hop rhythms. Tomorrow night is a standard Sin-é lineup, with four indie-rock bands presented by their record label, Eyeball: Kiss Kiss, New London Fire, the Velocet and the Anthem Sound. Sunday is the country-rocker Bow Thayer.

(Nate Chinen) DARCY JAMES ARGUE'S SECRET SOCIETY (Thursday) As the name implies, this big band is calibrated for maximum intrigue, with a sound equally suggestive of Steve Reich minimalism, harmonically advanced indie rock and orchestral jazz in the Bob Brookmeyer descent. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $12; $10 for members.

At 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) GEORGE SCHULLER'S CIRCLE WIDE (Sunday) George Schuller, a drummer, leads a group inspired by the acoustic fusion of Miles Davis, about 1968; the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin and the guitarist Brad Shepik apply the necessary push and pull.

Opera * 'DIE AGYPTISCHE HELENA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) With its convoluted libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and unevenly inspired score by Richard Strauss, this wry contemporary take on the Helen of Troy myth has remained a rarity since its 1928 premiere. But the Metropolitan Opera's fancifully surreal new production by David Fielding, mounted for the soprano Deborah Voigt, makes a compelling case for this intriguing work, thanks to Ms. Voigt's vocally lustrous and affecting portrayal of the title role, as well as the vibrant and insightful conducting of Fabio Luisi. The brilliant coloratura Diana Damrau is wonderful as the sorceress Aithra. The German tenor Torsten Kerl, who had to be replaced halfway through the performance on opening night, because of illness, is scheduled to sing Menelas for the remaining performances. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $120 to $220 tomorrow; $80 to $175 for Wednesday. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'ANDREA CHÉNIER' (Monday) The great Ben Heppner, arguably the leading Wagnerian tenor of our day, continues his bold explorations of far-flung repertory with the title role of Giordano's verismo opera, in the Met's revival of Nicolas Joël's 1996 production. Mr. Heppner may lack the vocal colorings and idiomatic expressivity of the heroic Italian tenors who excelled in this touchstone role. But in his compelling portrayal he sings with burnished sound, vigor and lyrical sensitivity. The rich-voiced soprano Violeta Urmana as Maddalena and the powerful baritone Mark Delavan as Gérard are very strong. Marco Armiliato conducts. Monday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Tommasini) 'La DONNA DEL LAGO' (Tonight, Sunday and Thursday) The New York City Opera continues its fruitful excavations of the bel canto repertory, this time with Rossini's wholly Italian take on Walter Scott's very Scottish original. Alexandrina Pendatchanska sings the part of Elena. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $130. (Bernard Holland) * 'FLAVIO' (Wednesday) The New York City Opera revives its successful production, directed by Chas Rader-Shieber, with sets by David Zinn. William Lacey makes his house debut conducting a cast that includes David Walker in the title role, Gerald Thompson as Guido and Marguerite Krull as Emilia. At 7:30 p.m., New York City Opera, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Vivien Schweitzer) 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) The City Opera offers Mark Lamos's spartan yet attractive production competently sung by Angela Maria Blasi and Raúl Melo. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; sold out. (Holland) METROPOLITAN OPERA NATIONAL COUNCIL GRAND FINALS/40TH ANNIVERSARY (Sunday and Tuesday) The Met goes from bottom to top this week: from 11 young unknowns, who have made their way through three rounds and past hundreds of other applicants in the National Council Auditions, to two of the opera world's biggest stars. Those singers, Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón, will be showcased in three acts from three operas: ''La Bohème,'' ''Manon'' and ''L'Elisir d'Amore,'' in honor of the 40th anniversary of the Met's move to Lincoln Center. Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday at 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $150 on Sunday, $250 to $1,250 on Tuesday. (Anne Midgette) * 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' (Tomorrow) Lillian Groag avoids the topical updating that has become a Gilbert and Sullivan tradition and focuses on the work's own satirical targets, which range from Victorian British society to the conventions of Italian grand opera. Even so, her direction for this City Opera production is inventive and lively, as are the performances by a cast that includes Sarah Jane McMahon as Mabel, Matt Morgan as Frederic and Marc Kudisch as the Pirate King. Gerald Steichen conducts. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; sold out. (Allan Kozinn) 'TURANDOT' (Tonight and Thursday night) Andrea Gruber's singing is a matter of debate -- listeners tend to love her intense energy or hate her vocal unevenness -- but Puccini's ice princess Turandot is one of two roles that she indisputably owns these days (the other is Abigaille in ''Nabucco''). Her Calaf is Richard Margison, an equally controversial though less prominent Canadian tenor who has a very respectable voice; for many the draw will be Hei-Kyung Hong, generally a radiant Liu. Since the withdrawal of Richard Armstrong, Fabio Luisi is conducting tonight and Thursday's performances; after that it's Marco Armiliato. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $140 tonight, $15 to $110 for Thursday. (Midgette) Classical Music ACADEMY OF ST. MARTIN IN THE FIELDS (Tomorrow and Sunday) Like many instrumental soloists at their peak, the violinist Joshua Bell has tried his hand at conducting. He will conduct and perform as a soloist in Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons'' and Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100, tillescenter.org; $48 and $90. Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $98. (Schweitzer) PIERRE-LAURENT AIMARD (Sunday) The excellent adventures of this fine French pianist continue with a mini-history of the piano, beginning with Scarlatti and Bach and extending to Messiaen, Carter, Boulez, Stockhausen and Kurtag. There will be talk as well. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $48. (Holland) * LES ARTS FLORISSANTS (Tomorrow) William Christie conducts outstanding participants from Le Jardin des Voix, Les Arts Florissants' academy for young singers to train them in Baroque repertory. The semistaged concert will feature madrigals and arias from Monteverdi's ''Orfeo'' and ''Incoronazione di Poppea,'' and scenes from Handel's ''Arminio,'' ''Deidamia'' and ''Rinaldo''; Cavalli's ''Calisto''; Piccinni's ''Buona Figliuola''; and Haydn's ''Incontro Improvviso.'' They will be accompanied by Les Arts Florissants. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $56. (Schweitzer) BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) A chamber orchestra crowds onto the intimate stage at Bargemusic this weekend to play a program that includes Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons,'' as well as two more of that prolific composer's works, the Concerto in B minor for Four Violins (RV 580) and the Concerto for Two Cellos (RV 531). Nestled amid all this Vivaldi is the premiere of a new work by Igor Raykhelson, commissioned by Bargemusic. On Thursday the violinist Chin Kim and the pianist David Oei play works by Stravinsky, Chausson, Respighi and Bizet as arranged by Waxman. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $50 and $25 for students, tonight, tomorrow and Sunday; $35 and $20 for students on Thursday; $30 for 65+ tonight and Thursday. (Kozinn) ALFRED BRENDEL (Wednesday) This distinguished pianist makes his annual early spring visit to Carnegie Hall. The music is by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $34 to $108. (Holland) BARBARA FRITTOLI (Sunday) Italian opera singers sometimes have an uneasy relationship with the recital stage. Barbara Frittoli, a frequent guest at the Metropolitan Opera (most recently in ''Così Fan Tutte''), will set out to disprove this notion in her New York recital debut, which draws heavily on opera composers, while adding a set of Schubert and melodies by Duparc. James Vaughan is the accompanist. At 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $48. (Midgette) * WOLFGANG HOLZMAIR and HERMINE HASELBÖCK (Tonight, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday) On the model of a ''Schubertiade'' -- a festival of Schubert's songs -- comes a ''Wolfiade,'' devoted to the songs of Hugo Wolf, with the baritone Wolfgang Holzmair. Tonight the second of this mini-festival's three free recitals at Weill Recital Hall features Wolf's ''Italienisches Liederbuch,'' with Mr. Holzmair and the mezzo-soprano Hermine Haselböck; the last, on Thursday, adds the soprano Susanna Phillips for a rarity, the complete ''Spanisches Liederbuch.'' Mr. Holzmair is also leading master classes at the Austrian Cultural Forum, at which six selected singers will work on refining Wolf songs (on Monday) for a concluding recital (on Wednesday). Tonight and Thursday night at 8, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall; Monday at 11 a.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan. Free, but reservations are required: (212) 319-5300 or acfny.org. (Midgette) * BLAIR McMILLEN (Wednesday) This young American pianist has the technique, musicianship and dynamism to play just about anything. On Wednesday he presents a recital of really new pieces, part of a three-concert series titled ''Music for the New Century: Works Composed Since 2000,'' presented by the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America at Columbia University. There will be pieces by Joan Tower, Steven Stucky, Marco Stroppa and others. At 8 p.m., Casa Italiana, Columbia University, 1161 Amsterdam Avenue, between 116th and 118th Streets, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-1623; free, but reservations are recommended. (Tommasini) * MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO (Tonight) During the concert season a select roster of artists from the prestigious summer Marlboro Music Festival tour America, including annual visits to New York. The next Musicians from Marlboro concert looks particularly enticing. The composer John Harbison's ''Twilight Music'' for horn, violin and piano is a worthy companion piece to Brahms's Trio in E flat (Op. 40), scored for the same unusual group of instruments. Those works frame this program, which also includes Ravel's String Quartet and Stravinsky's Concertino for String Quartet. At 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $40. (Tommasini) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) The fine Romanian pianist Radu Lupu joins Colin Davis in Mozart's supremely elegant final concerto, No. 27 in B flat. Mr. Davis, an eloquent Sibelius conductor, devotes the rest of the program to the Finnish composer's ''Lemminkainen'' Suite, a set of four tone poems that describe the feats of Lemminkainen as he endeavors to win the hand of Pohjola's daughter. At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96. (Kozinn) GARRICK OHLSSON (Sunday) Mr. Ohlsson plays four more sonatas in his admirable Beethoven series, including the ''Moonlight'' and the elusively beautiful Op. 101. At 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $56. (Holland) VASSILY PRIMAKOV (Sunday) Arium is a commodious cafe in the meatpacking district that is quickly becoming a popular site for classical music concerts. Its Sunday afternoon series continues with a recital by the young Russian pianist Vassily Primakov, who will play works by Schumann, Beethoven and Brahms. Complimentary wine and hors d'oeuvres are served. At 4 p.m., Arium for the Arts, 31 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 463-8630, ariumnyc.com; $40; $20 for members. (Tommasini) * DAVID RUSSELL (Tonight and tomorrow night) This English guitarist has a finely polished technique and a sharp interpretive sensibility. He is giving a master class tonight, and tomorrow he will play a recital that includes his own transcriptions of Bach's A minor Partita (BWV 1013, originally for flute) and Granados's ''Valses Poéticos,'' as well as works by Weiss, Barrios, Mertz, José Brocá and Hans Haug. Master class tonight at 7, recital tomorrow at 8, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; master class, $20; recital, $40. (Kozinn) * ST. LOUIS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight and tomorrow night) Classical musicians are lucky: 30 is the cut-off age for ''young'' in the outside world, but if you're a conductor you get to be ''young'' till you're 60 or so. At 48, David Robertson is certainly one of the most-watched ''young'' conductors around: one of his strengths is interesting programming, as his concerts with his St. Louis Symphony show. The first juxtaposes George Benjamin's ''Sudden Time'' (a New York premiere); Bartok's first piano concerto, with the redoubtable Pierre-Laurent Aimard; and Sibelius's Second Symphony. The second brings in the mezzo Susan Graham (substituting for the recovering Dawn Upshaw) for Ravel's ''Shéhérazade,'' between the Adagio from Mahler's 10th and, perhaps the greatest treat of all, John Adams's ''Harmonielehre.'' At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $85. (Midgette) TALICH QUARTET (Sunday) None of the original members of this Czech quartet, founded in 1964, are still in the group. But the current four, Jan Talich and Petr Macecek, violinists; Vladimir Bukac, a violist; and Petr Prause, a cellist, continue the tradition of playing Czech repertory, as well as chamber works. They will perform Haydn's Quartet (Op. 64, No. 5); Mendelssohn's Quartet in A minor; and Janacek's Quartet No. 2 (''Intimate Letters''). At 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 547-0715, frick.org; $25. (Schweitzer) * TALLIS SCHOLARS (Tomorrow) Peter Phillips and his a cappella group have given some superb concerts of English Renaissance works recently, and they now turn their attention to Monteverdi, Palestrina, Gombert, Lassus and Browne. Among the centerpieces is Monteverdi's Mass for Four Voices, a work worth discovering if you don't know it (or revisiting if you do). At 8 p.m., Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 120th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. BALLET BUILDERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) Dedicated to the proposition that ballet needs all the choreographers it can cultivate, Ballet Builders will present works by Graham Lustig, Robert Sher-Machherndl, Christophe Garcia, Jennifer Hart, David Justin, Gina Patterson and Kelly Ann Sloan, all chosen by audition. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160; $25. (Jennifer Dunning) COMPANY XIV (Tonight and tomorrow night) This group will present an evening of Baroque, classical and contemporary dance (by the company director, Austin McCormick), incorporated with text by the Beat poet Charles Bukowski and arias by Vivaldi, created for a tow-truck warehouse that is now a dance space. At 7, 303 Bond Street, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, reservations@companyxiv.com; $15. (Dunning) 'EDWARD SCISSORHANDS' (Tonight and tomorrow) Conceived, directed and choreographed by Matthew Bourne, this re-envisioning of Tim Burton's dark 1990 film of the same title revisits the theme of the outsider, here a gentle boy with scissors for hands. Tonight at 7:30, tomorrow at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $30 to $80.

Tomorrow and Sunday, the Liz Lerman Dance Exchange will perform Ms. Lerman's new ''613 Radical Acts of Prayer: Opening Acts,'' which explores ancient and modern ideas about prayer as a way to illuminate what unifies and divides human beings.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * brooklyn museum: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is essentialist and body-oriented and doesn't venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art the exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Grace Glueck) Guggenheim Museum: 'Family Pictures,' through April 16. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents posing awkwardly against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children, has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) * The METropolitan museum of art: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural cross-currents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * The Met: 'Mother of Pearl: A Tradition in Asian Lacquer,' through April 1. Ornamentalism is the term for this show of some 40 objects so exquisite that they might have been conceived with a modern museum conservator's soft white cotton gloves in mind. The technique for creating mini-mosaics from slivers of mollusk shell is an ancient one that was perfected in China before traveling to Korea, Japan, Thailand and India. Examples from all those places are here in writing boxes and tea trays guaranteed to appeal to any window-shopper's acquisitive yearnings and magpie eye. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * Moma: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This show makes a case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies are enthralling vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (See above.) (Smith) * Neue Galerie: 'Van Gogh and Expressionism,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious hommage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Schwendener) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lorna Simpson,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea JEAN SHIN: KEY PROMISES The idea is obvious, if you're as keen as this artist on recycling everyday objects: an installation using the word commands of countless computer keyboards to orchestrate a flow of suggested actions, desires and emotional states across four walls of a small gallery. From esc and shift to return and home. Art lite, perhaps, but expertly done. Frederieke Taylor Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-0992, frederieketaylorgallery.com, through April 7. (Smith) Galleries: Other 'Gifts of the Forest: Native Traditions in Wood and Bark' Drawn from the collections of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Connecticut, this show celebrates the trees of the rich forests that once covered the Northeast, yielding essential materials to the Pequot and other Eastern Woodland cultures. The objects run from ancient woodworking tools to contemporary objects that for the most part carry on tribal traditions, like the simple and beautiful wooden flute made in 1999 by Hawk Henires (Nipmuc) and adorned with an elegantly carved bird motif. Many things here were made in the 19th and 20th centuries: handsome woven baskets, carved bowls and spoons, decorated cradle boards for carrying babies, birch bark canoe models, an elegant birch-bark hamper whose sides bear a stylized tree motif. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets, (212) 713-2885, through April 27. (Glueck) Last Chance * DISSOCIATE: NEW HUMANS Dominated by poster-paintings on handy rolling bases, the occasional space-confounding mirror and sundry fliers, this mutable installation by the talented sculptor and sound artist Mika Tajima has served both as a performance space and as an advertising campaign for her noise band, New Humans. The textilelike patterns; limited, decoratorish palette; and diverse printing methods are a bit familiar to art in this age of self-conscious mechanical reproduction (Wade Guyton, for example). But it is worth seeing. Collaborators include the musician Howie Chen and the artists Vito Acconci, José Léon Cerillo and Philippe Decrauzat. Elizabeth Dee, 545 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-7545, elizabethdeegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * Sam Gordon: Three Ways: painting, Drawing, video There's a lot going on in this virtuosic solo show. Mr. Gordon's beautiful, cryptic drawings and paintings cover the gallery walls, while two sections of his epic video ''The Lost Kinetic World: Volumes 1-4,'' play on a monitor. The videos are a two-and-a-half-hour documentary compilation of art world events and personalities, good, bad and ugly, with past and present, prosaic and extraordinary, spliced together, willy-nilly. For whatever reason, Mr. Gordon watches the art world closely. Now it's time for the art world to wake up to him, a treasure in its midst. Feature Inc., 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-7772; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * Grey Art Gallery: 'Semina Culture: Wallace Berman & His Circle' The artist Wallace Berman (1926-76) was a central, charismatic figure in an underground of West Coast artists and poets in the 1950s and 60s. A collagist, poet, photographer and the publisher of an influential journal, Semina, he inspired others to make art too, sparking hidden aptitude in startling places. After meeting him, drifters, movie stars, ex-marines and petty criminals found themselves starting to paint and write. And a traveling love company of them has come to Grey Art Gallery, trailing dreams, delusions and marijuana clouds. New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * PHILIP TAAFFE This artist's first New York show since 2000 anoints him as one of the best painters of his generation, and maybe the only one to extend both 1970s Pattern and Decoration and '80s appropriation into new areas. Aided by Warhol's tinted colors and Pollock's all-over rhythms, and some ingenious printing techniques of their own, these suavely eye-popping new paintings sample everything from Northwest Coast Indian masks to Islamic ornamental patterns to marbleizing and gilding. They define visual culture as a great chain of being in which anything can be connected with proper placement, color and scale in an inspiring message of unity in difference. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * PAUL STRAND AT WORK More than three dozen vintage improbably rich, impeccably printed vintage photographs, taken by Strand between 1943 and 1953, make their measured, concentrated way through a range of rural subjects in New England, France and Italy and dot the gallery walls like faceted gems. Pace/MacGill Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'United Black Girls,' This group show is a response by six artists to the way the black female body appears in popular culture. Ifetayo A. Abdus-Salam takes charge by channeling Pam Grier; Jessica Peavy links early feminism and music videos; Heather Hart takes aim with crocheted guns. Omya Alston, Ashley Reid and Felicia Megginson combine images of exploitation and empowerment in various ways, with a healthy dose of attitude. Courtney J. Martin and Vanessa C. B. Riding put it all together. Rush Arts Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-9552; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)"

2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"Behold the mighty Cyclone: 2,640 feet of rattling, wheezing terror in lumber and steel, 12 drops and 6 turnabouts in just under two minutes. My, my. Calling it a roller coaster would be like calling the Sundance Kid a gunslinger: rusty perhaps, and scary for all the wrong reasons, but dazzling when it moves. Legend has it that after one ride in the 1940s, a mute man regained his voice just in time to say, ''I feel sick.'' After three generations of knuckle-whitening, the Cyclone, left, opens on Sunday for its 80th summer on the Coney Island Boardwalk. This may not be your last chance for a turn on the coaster, but it will be the season to say goodbye to the backdrop, goodbye to the ambience and goodbye to Astroland, the classic American amusement park in all its odd and tarnished splendor. A development company has purchased the park and plans to tear down the Astro Tower, the bumper cars and the Tilt-a-Whirl in favor of a hotel. The Albert family, who opened Astroland in 1962, intends to keep operating the Cyclone on a lease from the city. Admission to the park, open weekends only until June 10 and every day this summer, is free. From the highest rides on a good day you can see clear across the Boardwalk, past the freak shows, past the hot dog stands and out over the untamed ocean. (Astroland, 1000 Surf Avenue, Coney Island, Brooklyn, 718-372-0275, astroland.com; Cyclone tickets are $6; $4 for each repeat ride.) MICHAEL BRICK"

It's playing in Taxter & Spengemann's upstairs gallery, and it's a delight. Like a terpsichorean Thelma and Louise, these dancers are on a journey, progressing through various American landscapes. They begin at a beach, move through futuristic architecture (in Albany I think), then to the desert and into the mountains, ending up in a nighttime mall parking lot."

2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"A monthlong series of plays devoted to scientific and technological topics might not sound like an exciting string of nights out, but the folks behind the Ensemble Studio Theater/Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Science & Technology Project hope to persuade audiences otherwise. The ninth annual First Light festival of works commissioned and developed by the theater and the foundation is meant to challenge the notion that scientists and engineers are uninteresting. It is also intended to offer theatergoers an ''enriching experience of viewing the wondrous stories that can be created when science and theater unite,'' Carlos Armesto, who directs the project with Graeme Gillis, wrote in an e-mail message. ''It is through the expressive medium of theater that we hope to promote a greater understanding of the people and ideas that affect us.'' This year's lineup includes readings, workshops and one full production: ''Serendib,'' by David Zellnik, directed by Mr. Armesto. Mr. Zellnik began writing his play after a visit to Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka, where he participated in a wild-monkey study. ''The monkeys overwhelmed me with their sense of individuality and soulfulness,'' he said. He was equally fascinated by the scientists, though, and his comedy is about both groups. In ''Serendib,'' with Nitya Vidyasagar and P. J. Sosko, above, scientists working on an underfinanced study of Sri Lankan monkeys invite filmmakers to create a documentary, hoping publicity will mean more money for the project. Once the cameras are rolling, personal and professional rivalries get in the way -- and not just among the humans. In addition to people, the show features monkey puppets created by Emily DeCola. Other festival highlights include a reading of ''Ever More Intelligent,'' by Alex Timbers, the artistic director of Les Freres Corbusier. Mr. Timbers's play, set in Victorian England, finds two drunken scientists in a laboratory with microscopic flesh-eating robots. Yikes. Now who said science was boring? (Through April 27, Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, 212-352-3101 or theatermania.com; $10 for readings/workshops, $30 for ''Serendib.'' The full lineup is at ensemblestudiotheatre.org.) STEVEN McELROY"
2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"A Rider University freshman was in critical condition yesterday after what prosecutors termed a possible hazing episode at a fraternity house, the Mercer County prosecutor's office said. The student, Gary Devercelly, 18, of Long Beach, Calif., was taken to the Fuld campus of Capital Health System in Trenton around 2 a.m. yesterday after the police came to the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity house at Rider University because of a report that a student was vomiting after he drank too much, Prosecutor Casey DeBlasio said in a statement. Another student who left the house earlier was treated at the hospital for alcohol poisoning and released. Prosecutors said the matter was under investigation as a possible case of hazing.

2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"The former chief of staff to Alberto R. Gonzales testified on Thursday that he had consulted regularly with the attorney general about dismissing United States attorneys, disputing Mr. Gonzales's public account of his role as very limited.

2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"New York City's unemployment rate dropped to 4.8 percent in February, from 4.9 percent in January, the State Labor Department reported yesterday. The city's jobless rate, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, has held below 5 percent for seven consecutive months, the longest stretch since 1988. The state's jobless rate rose to 4.4 percent, from 4.3 percent in January, but remained below the national rate of 4.5 percent. The number of private-sector jobs in the state increased only slightly last month, rising by 5,200, or 0.1 percent, to 7.18 million. In the last 12 months, the state has added 103,100 private-sector jobs, a gain of 1.2 percent. PATRICK McGEEHAN"
2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"Forget campaigning. Last week, Rudolph W. Giuliani held a presidential fund-raiser every day of the week. Senator John McCain raised money at three events on Wednesday and another Thursday, racking up 27 this month alone. And Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is racing through five fund-raisers on Friday and Saturday, culminating with a gala in Miami that ends three hours before midnight. This hurricane of money-raising is testimony to the importance of what has become the first contest of the 2008 presidential race: the first fund-raising period of the campaign, which ends at midnight Saturday."
2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has reached a verbal agreement on contracts with two coalitions of unions on the Metro-North Railroad, ending a labor dispute that has dragged on for four years and averting the possibility that some of the unions would strike this summer. But the deal did not include track workers, who are represented by the Teamsters union. Representatives of unions and the authority last night confirmed the agreement, which is expected to be formalized today so that it can be sent to the rank and file for ratification. Metro-North workers have been divided for several years between two rival union coalitions and, with the exception of the Teamsters, this deal brings both groups together under contracts that are virtually identical, according to Norman Brown, a machinists union official who is also a member of the transportation authority's board. The contracts give workers wage increases over the next three years of 10.5 percent. WILLIAM NEUMAN"

He is survived by Mildred, his devoted wife of 64 years; his three children and their spouses, Bob and Siri Marshall of Deephaven, MN, Sara Gibson of New Canaan, CT, and Nancy Marshall and Andy Sareyan of Greenwich, CT; and his grandchildren, Serin Marshall, Tally and Katie Gibson, and Alex and Eliza Sareyan. A native of Pittsburgh, Bob was educated at Shadyside Academy, the Asheville School, Princeton (Class of 1940) and Harvard Business School. He served our country in World War II as Lt. (JG) in the U.S. Navy on the USS Capella in the Atlantic. After working at W.R.

Passionate, but not obsessive, about sports, Bob belonged, at various times, to the Bronxville Field Club, St. Andrew's and Siwanoy Golf Clubs, the Ausable Club and Point o' Woods Association. Bob was active in community affairs in Bronxville, chairing the Community Fund and serving on the Library Board, among other volunteer activities. His family and all who knew him will miss him.

2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"The best of Joe Brainard's small-scale collages and works on paper -- some of which are sexually explicit -- combine a startling intimacy with a postmodern predilection for appropriation. A gifted poet, artist and set designer, Mr. Brainard (1942-94) is one of the art world's great enigmas: in the mid-1970s he exhibited almost 1,500 miniature images and collages in a single exhibition, and then he more or less disappeared from sight. Tibor de Nagy Gallery rescued him from obscurity with a posthumous retrospective in 1997, and now it is back with more than 75 works, among them little-shown erotic pieces. The tiny nude figure studies on the inside of spent matchbooks are crude but gorgeous to look at, as are ''Untitled (Tattoo),'' above, and several of his other images of male torsos, covered in tattoos of roses, butterflies, hearts, skulls, birds, chains and the names of friends, lovers and admired poets. The tattoos give the torsos a firm, sculptural quality, but they also have a lightness of touch and a playfulness that characterize so many of the other objects here. Among them is a collage of a pair of underpants, a mixed-media image of a bouquet of pansies and a quilt of the Madonna and Child made of hundreds of pieces of stitched fabric. Highly personal, even romantic, this is simple art by a gentle soul. (Through April 14, Tibor de Nagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, 212-262-5050, tibordenagy.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO"

2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,"Don't expect any sylphs, swans or sugarcoated stories of courtly love when Ballet Memphis presents two programs at the Joyce Theater next week. The company's artistic director, Dorothy Gunther Pugh, takes the idea of regional ballet seriously; her roots are in Memphis, after all, and she founded Ballet Memphis in 1986 with just two dancers. Her troupe now stands 14 strong, and its offerings often reflect Ms. Pugh's deep ties to the South. Its programs in New York will include dancers like Jane Hope Rehm, above, and works like Julia Adam's ''Curtain of Green,'' based on a Eudora Welty story, and ''In Dreams,'' created by Ballet Memphis's resident choreographer, Trey McIntyre. Motivated by Mr. McIntyre's ideas of philanthropy and place, ''In Dreams'' is danced to the music of Roy Orbison. Also on the bill is Thaddeus Davis's ''Mercurial Balance,'' set partly to spoken word and hip-hop, and Ms. Adam's ''Awakening,'' based on Kate Chopin's tragic feminist novel of the same title. With its New Orleans setting and theme of female struggle for independence, ''The Awakening'' is a perfect piece for Ballet Memphis. If small regional troupes are an endangered species in the ballet ecosystem, so are female choreographers and artistic directors. These sad facts make Ballet Memphis's two decades of spunky existence especially grand and poignant. (Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday through April 7 at 8 p.m., and April 7 and 8 at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org; $38.)

The legendary Modernist architect, who died in 2005, donated his New Canaan, Conn., country retreat -- which includes three vernacular buildings and 10 structures designed by Johnson in addition to the glass-and-steel pavilion that made him famous -- to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which will open the 47-acre site to the public (by appointment only) in June.

Could the reviewer of this ''depressing and unpleasant book'' have had in mind Burleigh's respectful but less-than-exuberant review of Judt's own work, ''Postwar,'' in The Tablet of London (Jan.7, 2006)? ''In an avowedly 'opinionated' book, perhaps the only thing missing is the author's capacity to examine his own assumptions and prejudices. These are evident whenever Judt discusses the Catholic Church, Christian Democracy or any form of conservatism.''"

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"All dance is influenced to some extent by the artists who perform it. That makes for difficulties in restaging pieces with different dancers, and even calls authorship into question occasionally. (Did George Balanchine really create the unnerving solo that ends his ''Episodes,'' or did Paul Taylor, the man who danced it?) JOHN JASPERSE, a modern-dance choreographer with a gift for poetic insights and visual effects, cuts to the chase in a new piece, ''BECKY, JODI AND JOHN,'' which opens Wednesday at Dance Theater Workshop. It celebrates Becky Hilton, Jodi Melnick and Mr. Jasperse. The three, who will perform the piece, met nearly two decades ago and have remained friends. Mr. Jasperse explores the constancy of their personalities, and the role of dancing, in making their friendship possible. 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $25. NORA CHIPAUMIRE is a relatively new modern-dance choreographer. Whatever else her new ''DARK SWAN'' may be, it will be performed by the powerful Ms. Chipaumire on Thursday at the BRICstudio in Brooklyn. Sadly, its theme is more pertinent than ever today. Born in wartime Zimbabwe, Ms. Chipaumire traces the journey of a woman as she loses her country, her family and even her bearings, in a solo inspired by the ballet classic ''The Dying Swan'' and set to its score, by Saint-Saëns. The performance is part of 651 Arts's ''Choreography in Development'' series. 57 Rockwell Place, next to the BAM Harvey Theater, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4181, 651arts.org; $5.

When my wife and I walked from the Zambia side across a footbridge to a verdant mesa island not as tall as the falls, we were thoroughly watered by the mist and saw, for the only time in our lives, a 360-degree rainbow. It wasn't just extra-ordinary, it was extraordinary. Would that some of its beauty fall upon the suffering citizens of Zimbabwe these days. George Ubogy Greenwich, Conn. To the Editor: As a Zambian, I was delighted to see Victoria Falls splashed across the front page of the Travel Section. Then I spied the dreaded ''d'' word: discovery. In 2007 can The New York Times still be using this word? It's quite ironic considering that the same article says ''Livingstone began hearing about Victoria Falls -- called Mosi-oa-Tunya, or 'the smoke that thunders,' by Africans.'' If the locals had a name for them then they existed before he saw them. Being the first European to see them is not the same as discovering them. Are things only valued if they are seen through Western eyes? If I had been the first Zambian to see Stonehenge would anyone believe I had discovered it? Sylvia Chilufya New York"

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"IT is no surprise that Sunday has become the new Saturday, a day of errands and chores, of tidying up odds and ends of work or sitting at the desk for hours at a time, with maybe a little exercise and television thrown in. I am surprised, though, that this bothers me. Like many baby boomers, I have spent a great deal of energy cultivating an unsentimental and even antitraditional attitude. But I just can't seem to shake my fond memories of a quiet day in Queens, with few cars on the streets, everything except maybe a drugstore and a restaurant or two closed, and three generations of my family laughing over the remains of a Sunday dinner cooked by my grandmother. Though Sunday may no longer be a day of rest, Sunday dinner can often define the rest of the day. And for many families -- unable to bring everyone to the table during the rest of the week because of soccer practices and music lessons, after-school programs and long workdays -- it is the only time to gather as one."

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Fashion stylists have one of the most fungible, hard-to-define jobs on the planet. One day they'll be fussing over fabrics with a designer, or casting models for a show; the next, they're consulting with a celebrity about what to wear to a movie premiere or flying to Dubai with trunks overflowing with runway looks for a photo shoot. Take David Bradshaw, who is currently the editor of GQ Style, the glossy biannual offshoot of British GQ. During the past two decades, he has collaborated on videos for Michael Jackson, Madonna and Janet Jackson; steered the fashion content of Arena and Arena Homme Plus magazines; helped articulate the image of labels like Katharine Hamnett, Jil Sander and Calvin Klein; and worked as Miuccia Prada's right-hand man in men's wear. He is also, at least judging by the photos on these pages, not an ungainly model."

And there are still tickets available, from $250 to $1,250. Tuesday at 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org. Across the plaza City Opera is preparing a treat: a reprise of its 2003 production of Handel's ''FLAVIO'' by Chas Rader-Shieber. It's a bright, antic production that brings a delightful touch of zaniness to an opera that is by turns madcap and sober. It is also the company debut of Gerald Thompson, a countertenor who has been garnering rave reviews and who will go over to the Met at month's end to make his debut there in ''Giulio Cesare.''

This one should be well worth hearing. Mr. Holzmair has also led six selected singers through a set of master classes focused on Wolf; the results can be heard in a recital on Wednesday at the Austrian Cultural Forum itself. Master class, Wednesday at 8 p.m., Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan; recital, Thursday at 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall. Free, but reservations are required: (212) 319-5300, acfny.org. Finally, one of the week's most interesting and wacky recitals takes place on Sunday night at Zankel Hall, where Pierre-Laurent Aimard, the ever more respected pianist, conducts a personal tour of the history of his instrument in a dazzling array of short pieces by 29 composers, from Scarlatti and Bach through Carter and Kurtag. Don't miss it. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $48."

She was 81 years old and resided in Houston and Hunt, Texas. Born March 28, 1925 in Liverpool, England, she was the daughter of Hildegarde Storey and George Baldwin Journeay. Her father was an independent cotton broker, then based in Liverpool. She graduated from Chatham Hall in 1943 and Smith College in 1947. She married David Peake in 1948 and moved to Houston in 1950. She was a ''Proud Texan,'' in her words, with distinguished Texas ancestors dating back to the earliest days of the Republic. She counted among her ancestors a Texas Ranger, Civil War military leaders, judges, a lieutenant governor of Texas, a chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission, and perhaps the best-known, her paternal great-grandfather, Henry Journeay, a survivor of the ill-fated Mier Expedition that in 1842 went to Mexico in retaliation for the Mexican raid on San Antonio. The Texans were defeated by Santa Anna and subjected them to a unique and brutal retribution commemorated in a Frederic Remington painting. A jar was filled with beans, every tenth bean being black, while the others were white. The ones who drew a black bean were immediately shot. Henry dug deep, pulled out a white bean and was spared. She is survived by her daughter Robin Peake Stuart and husband, Sandy of Lake Forest, Illinois, her son David Wainwright Peake, Jr. and wife, Katherine of Fredericksburg, Texas, her daughter Susan Storey Peake of Sea Island, Georgia and seven grandchildren, who were her true joy. Her love of family and friends and her wonderful sense of humor will be sorely missed by all. If desired, please make contributions to Chatham Hall, Chatham, Virginia, 24531."

Shulman shot to fame 60 years ago, photographing the work of mid-century architectural giants like Richard Neutra and Pierre Koenig (center), but he remembers Jacobsen with particular fondness. ''He was special because despite his great talent, he never promoted himself or openly sought attention,'' Shulman says. ''That makes him a true icon.''"

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"IT is no surprise that Sunday has become the new Saturday, a day of errands and chores, of tidying up odds and ends of work or sitting at the desk for hours at a time, with maybe a little exercise and television thrown in. I am surprised, though, that this bothers me. Like many baby boomers, I have spent a great deal of energy cultivating an unsentimental and even antitraditional attitude. But I just can't seem to shake my fond memories of a quiet day in Queens, with few cars on the streets, everything except maybe a drugstore and a restaurant or two closed, and three generations of my family laughing over the remains of a Sunday dinner cooked by my grandmother. Though Sunday may no longer be a day of rest, Sunday dinner can often define the rest of the day. And for many families -- unable to bring everyone to the table during the rest of the week because of soccer practices and music lessons, after-school programs and long workdays -- it is the only time to gather as one."

He grew up in Salisbury, NC and graduated from Catawba College in 1953. He was an English major who immersed himself in the written word and particularly loved poetry. He touched many lives with his kindness and empathy. His life became a battle with mother nature 30 years ago and he fought valiantly and with great inner strength for many years accepting pain and limitation for the gift of life. He never tired of life and found quality in an evershrinking existence. He is survived by a wife who thanks him for taking her on an incredible journey and many family and friends who have marveled at his fortitude. The world is not better off without him but he is better off without the burden of his body. His memorial service will be in your heart and if you wish to remember your favorite charity in his honor.

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Just as the little green buds emerge in the spring, so do the AUDUBONS at the NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY, which has the world's largest collection of that artist's work. For the third year now the society is making a rite of displaying a selection of 40 fragile watercolors from the 435 that Audubon used for his masterwork volumes, ''The Birds of America.'' The newest batch, which went on view Friday, have been taken from protective storage, where they are kept away from light for years at a time. Alongside the watercolors, the society will also display documents and other historical materials. (Previous exhibitions have included stuffed birds and even Audubon's muzzle-loading shotgun, which he used to ensure that many of his elusive subjects stayed quite still while he was painting them.) The museum's Web site, nyhistory.org, offers a helpful list of birds that migrate through the New York area, including the red-tailed hawk, the great egret and even the turkey vulture, circling high over Manhattan in search of a free lunch. Through May 20, 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. The historical society will also dig into its vaults to pull out portraits, landscapes, drawings and prints from its huge collections of work by Asher B. Durand, the Hudson River School master, to complement a major Durand show opening Friday at the Brooklyn Museum. ''The World of Asher B. Durand: The Artist in Antebellum New York,'' April 13 through Sept. 30. With landscapes in mind the work of a radically different sort of landscape artist are going on display Saturday in Manhattan, at two locations of the Gagosian Gallery. Works from the mid-1980s by WALTER DE MARIA -- probably best known for ''Lightning Field,'' his solemn grid of steel poles arranged on a remote New Mexico mesquite prairie -- are on display through May 5. ''A Computer Which Will Solve Every Problem in the World/3-12 Polygon,'' a stark, rhythmic floor arrangement of 75 polygonal bars, is at 522 West 21st Street, and ''13, 14, 15 Meter Rows,'' a similar meditation on matter and mathematical progression, is at 555 West 24th Street. The work of Mr. De Maria, who has spoken of the ''strangeness of the meaning of geometry,'' brings to mind natural mysticism in the mold of Pythagoras and numerology. But he cautions against easy interpretation: ''Every good work should have at least 10 meanings.''"

In the $26 million movie from Chicago Pictures, one of Mr. Sadek's own luxury cars, a $200,000 Porsche Carrera GT, was totaled. He agreed to that car's being destroyed in the name of art. But then one of the film's stars, Eddie Griffin, smashed another of Mr. Sadek's cars -- a rare Ferrari Enzo, said to be worth $1.5 million -- while practicing last week at a track for a charity race to promote the movie."

The panorama, circa 1800, was a device for exhibiting a huge painting, stretched across a stage between two posts. Viewers paid a small admission for the privilege of seeing the painting unfurled. The panorama was patented in France by an American artist and inventor living in Paris named Robert Fulton (known primarily for inventing the steamboat). The first painting exhibited on this particular panorama was ''The Burning of Moscow,'' painted by Mr. Fulton himself. Brayton Harris Mission Hills, Kan."

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"When RAINER WERNER FASSBINDER died of a drug overdose in 1982, he had just turned 37 -- which still seems astonishing a quarter-century later. Part of the shock is the thought of what he might have gone on to accomplish as he matured alongside his baby-boomer colleagues in West Germany and beyond. His generational cohort included Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese as well as Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders; if any of their careers had ended when Fassbinder's did, the loss to cinema would have been grievous indeed. Even more stunning, though, is just how much he accomplished in so short a time. When it came to writing and directing, he was prolific, even compulsive, as if he knew his time was short. And perhaps for this reason his work has an urgency that has hardly diminished over time. His exhumations of German history -- a politically charged project in the 1960s and '70s -- have a ferocity rarely seen in costume drama, and his inquiries into sex and power are capable of delivering a jolt of discomfort even to jaded eyes that think they've seen it all before. An excellent and eclectic sampling of his films will be presented at the Museum of Modern Art starting Monday. Among the highlights are ''Lili Marleen'' and ''Veronika Voss,'' but the program, called ''Fassbinder in the Collection,'' represents the full range of his films. It also offers audiences a chance to rediscover the enigmatic, occasionally frightening charms of Hanna Schygulla, the great German actress who was Fassbinder's muse, alter ego and fetish object.

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"IT is no surprise that Sunday has become the new Saturday, a day of errands and chores, of tidying up odds and ends of work or sitting at the desk for hours at a time, with maybe a little exercise and television thrown in. I am surprised, though, that this bothers me. Like many baby boomers, I have spent a great deal of energy cultivating an unsentimental and even antitraditional attitude. But I just can't seem to shake my fond memories of a quiet day in Queens, with few cars on the streets, everything except maybe a drugstore and a restaurant or two closed, and three generations of my family laughing over the remains of a Sunday dinner cooked by my grandmother. Though Sunday may no longer be a day of rest, Sunday dinner can often define the rest of the day. And for many families -- unable to bring everyone to the table during the rest of the week because of soccer practices and music lessons, after-school programs and long workdays -- it is the only time to gather as one."

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Baccarat's latest designer collaboration represents a sea change for the 243-year-old company. At the trade show Maison et Objet in January, it unveiled a line of lighting and tableware by the Paris-based designer Arik Levy that is both intellectual and, in the case of the single-armed Fantome chandelier (above), frugal. In a quest to make the tony brand more accessible to those without high ceilings and higher budgets, Levy -- who's known for his scientific approach to design -- proposed chopping up the classic chandelier (figuratively, that is) and selling it by the piece. At $1,990, ''FantÃ$(4$)me can be used as a design element, 55 lined up in a room, or as a complete object,'' he explains. ''The one arm brings the rest of the chandelier with it, psychologically. It feels like all the other arms are flying behind it, like ghosts.'' Monica Khemsurov"

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"For those wondering just what Dina Matos McGreevey was thinking as she gazed, wide-eyed and smiling, at her husband while he was informing the world that he was a gay American, fear not. The estranged wife of former Gov. James E. McGreevey has a book coming out in May promising to tell ''the truth behind the lies,'' and a tour to follow, including appearances on ''Good Morning America'' and Oprah Winfrey's TV show. Exactly what she will say on any of these programs is anyone's guess. In an e-mail message, a spokeswoman for Hyperion, the publisher for her book, said Ms. Matos McGreevey was scheduled to appear on May 1, to coincide with the book's release. (A spokeswoman for Ms. Winfrey said only that she was scheduled to appear in a coming show.) Ms. Matos McGreevey will then sit for a two-part interview on ''Good Morning America'' on May 2 and 3."

This was a large community effort, beyond even the work of the two main rival teams (the other being the High-Z Supernova Search, led by Brian Schmidt). In fact, several generations of scientists and dedicated projects previously studied and classified the supernovae and honed them in their role as ''standard candles'' (the Calan/Tololo Supernova Survey deserves particular mention)."

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''36 Hours; Nairobi, Kenya'' by Jeffrey Gettleman (March 18) brought back pleasant memories of the Giraffe Center and the Karen Blixen Museum. I would like to call attention to one must-see opportunity that is identified on the map that accompanied the article, but was not mentioned by Mr. Gettleman. Nairobi National Park, Kenya's oldest national park, was established in 1946. Nairobi is the only major city in the world that neighbors a major game protection park. It is eerie when we review our photos that show this park with wildlife in a natural setting and the city skyline in the distance. We also saw incredible birds. It is well worth spending a few of those 36 hours here. Sondra R. Markman Edison, N.J."

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"The question posed in Robin Marantz Henig's article ''Darwin's God'' (March 4) may be answered in Richard Panek's article. Rational organisms require explanations, yet science has been incapable of providing an explanation of how the physical universe came to exist. No wonder that man has found it necessary to believe in gods, a belief not much removed from accepting that something called ''dark matter'' (which can't be demonstrated either) comprises 96 percent of the universe."

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"''Moneyball'' was supposed to have taught baseball a lesson. A 2003 best seller by Michael Lewis, the book recounted how Billy Beane, the general manager of the low-budget Oakland Athletics, won a string of division titles by assembling a roster of inexpensive, unathletic players whose ability to get on base was being undervalued by the market. Although the book riled many baseball traditionalists, it was also considered a watershed, one that would force even the most intransigent franchises to rely on statistical analysis if they hoped to remain competitive."

We realized we should have been in a 4x4 when 22 kilometers of road that was meant to be a national highway just disappeared without warning. There is a spectacular train from Goa that we should have taken. When we finally got there, we were shown around this enormous rocky site with hundreds of temples. It's one of the most important Hindu pilgrimage sites in India. You got a real sense that it was once a cultural epicenter for that part of India.

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"What is modern, anyway? Is it classic 20th century (as in Modernism, with a capital ''M'') or contemporary (modern with a small ''m'')? The answer, of course, is both. And while you're at it, why not add something really old to the mix? Who wants to live in a period room, even if the period is the 1960s?"

''Do you like the smell of wine?'' Joshua asks my son. Oh great, I think, soon they'll be going out drinking. ''Did you know Listerine can make bombs?'' he adds. I listen more closely. Later on they're playing ''restaurant management,'' and our kitchen counter is littered with pantry stock. I have the role of fussy patron, and as much as I'm trying to stay in character, I keep fast-forwarding to the final scene of me as busboy."

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"CHAYKIN--Irving, born August 16, 1912 to David and Dora Chaykin, accomplished a great many things in his 94 years. Some of his proudest achievements include a tremendous career in Accountancy education at City College, his alma mater, where he was continually voted by the Student Body as most popular Instructor and later named Professor Emeritus. In addition to his private practice as a CPA and his college teaching, he founded the Chaykin CPA Review Course in 1950, which was acquired by the Washington Post in 1990. His training resulted in generations of Accountants who attribute part of their success to Mr. Chaykin. Among many other honors, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Hofstra University, a conference room in his name at Baruch College and a Townsend Harris Medal for exemplary contribution in the field of Accounting Education. In addition to his professional contributions, Mr. Chaykin was an active synagogue President and Board Member, and a generous philanthropist, recognized time and again with his wife Clarice for their support of Jewish causes. Together, they were honored by Israel Bonds, Hadassah and the Jewish Theological Seminary, among many other organizations over the years. His deepest source of pride, however, was his family, and it is there that his legacy will live on most profoundly. Clarice, his wife of 61 years, his children Dan and Jackie, Maury and Susannah and Debbie and Harvey, as well as his grandchildren Carla, Alex, Molly, David, Zoe and Rose remember him, even in this time of loss and sadness, with great warmth, admiration and laughter. He is remembered lovingly by all whose path he crossed for his quick wit, his kind and gentle nature and a full life lived with integrity and generosity always."

Sven was the much beloved husband of Jytte, father of Per, Anette and Niels, father-in-law of Adrienne, Srdjan and Cheryl, and proud grandfather of six. Born in Taarbaek, Denmark, Sven came to the US in 1951 with an M.S. from the Technical University of Denmark as a plant engineer for E.I. du Pont, where he worked until joining Lummus in Newark, NJ, in 1957. While assigned to Lummus Spain, Sven met and married Jytte Engel-Andreasen. Sven held several senior management positions with Lummus in Europe and the US, and was appointed President of The Lummus Company in 1980, and eventually CEO of The Lummus Group. After his retirement in 1985, Sven continued his association with Lummus and its parent, ABB, as a Board member of ABB Lummus Global until 2003. Sven was notable for his honor and integrity: a man of convictions and great strength of character, he was a gentleman in all that he did, whether business or personal.

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"IT is no surprise that Sunday has become the new Saturday, a day of errands and chores, of tidying up odds and ends of work or sitting at the desk for hours at a time, with maybe a little exercise and television thrown in. I am surprised, though, that this bothers me. Like many baby boomers, I have spent a great deal of energy cultivating an unsentimental and even antitraditional attitude. But I just can't seem to shake my fond memories of a quiet day in Queens, with few cars on the streets, everything except maybe a drugstore and a restaurant or two closed, and three generations of my family laughing over the remains of a Sunday dinner cooked by my grandmother. Though Sunday may no longer be a day of rest, Sunday dinner can often define the rest of the day. And for many families -- unable to bring everyone to the table during the rest of the week because of soccer practices and music lessons, after-school programs and long workdays -- it is the only time to gather as one."

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Back when it was one of the most overhyped new shows of the season, ''30 ROCK'' wasn't quite as good as people said it was. The strain of trying to be an alt-sitcom and still attract an audience was too apparent. But as the season went on, and Tina Fey grew more comfortable playing herself, and Alec Baldwin and Jane Krakowski were reliably funny as the preening network executive and the neurotic star, and Jack McBrayer made something brilliant out of the fey NBC page Kenneth, the show got better and better -- and the talk gradually subsided. Then it went away for a few weeks. It returns to the schedule on Thursday (NBC, 8:40 p.m.), and while the writers'-room high jinks are still dull, the plot involving Jack (Mr. Baldwin) using Kenneth as his Mata Hari in a battle with a gay network rival (Will Arnett) is the show at its giggly best. Andy Baldwin is a ruggedly handsome Navy lieutenant. He's a doctor (Duke undergrad; University of California, San Francisco, medical school). He's stationed in Honolulu. He's a triathlete. And to make it all just a teensy bit better, the award he won from an endurance-sports group wasn't for his athletic prowess; it was humanitarian of the year. But there's one less-than-perfect thing about this paragon: He's also a reality-TV star. Lieutenant Baldwin wields the roses in ''THE BACHELOR: OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'' which begins Monday (ABC, 9:45 p.m.) with the traditional gathering of the 25 highly made-up bachelorettes, including the de rigueur drunken bachelorette falling down. Best pre-rose-ceremony moment: when one of the women sings the national anthem to the lieutenant. And damned if he doesn't tear up."
2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"I was heartsick when I finished Sara Corbett's article (March 18). These women soldiers who served their country were treated with the utmost contempt by their own. Gen. Peter Pace, who is so worried about the effect of homosexual soldiers on the service, ought to look closely at what the heterosexual soldier is doing to his fellow soldiers. Officers using their rank to degrade, at the least, and rape, at the worst, bring all under suspicion. One hundred percent intolerance for such behavior is called for. Instead, the victim is afraid to ask for help. Always a supporter of women in the military, I now wonder if those who oppose them are right, that it is too dangerous, sadly not just on the battlefield but also in the barracks."

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Saudis Assert Themselves The News -- King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia called the American occupation of Iraq illegal and warned that the United States would continue to dictate the region's politics unless Arab governments united. Behind the News -- His speech to the Arab League seemed to underscore growing differences between Saudi Arabia and the White House and suggested that the Saudis would not be beholden to the policies of the United States. But Saudi and other Arab officials suggested the king was positioning himself to get leverage in the Arab world and serve as a counterbalance to Iran. A Bloody Reprisal in Iraq The News -- One of the bloodiest episodes of Iraq's sectarian strife unfolded in Tal Afar, where gunmen, some of them apparently police officers, killed scores of Sunnis. Behind the News The revenge killings followed two suicide bombings in a Shiite area that killed 83 people and wounded many more. Witnesses said gunmen went house to house in a Sunni area, dragging people out to shoot them. As many as 70 may have been killed; bodies were carted to Mosul for identification, above. Some gunmen were identified by witnesses as police officers. The Iraqi Army intervened. Talking Again The News -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she had persuaded Israeli and Palestinian leaders to hold talks twice a month. Behind the News -- The agreement followed three days of shuttle diplomacy by Ms. Rice. But the talks will deal only with day-to-day concerns such as movement by Palestinians and arms smuggling and not the big issues that have long bedeviled peace negotiations -- the status of Jerusalem, the borders of an eventual Palestinian state and whether Palestinian refugees would have a right to return to Israel. Into the Gulf The News -- The United States began a major military exercise in the Persian Gulf, dispatching two aircraft carriers and more than a dozen other ships there. Behind the News -- Bush administration officials said the calculated show of force was part of a broader strategy to contain Iranian power and to send a signal that even with its forces stretched thin by the Iraq war, the United States still has the means to project power in the region. It was the first time that two carriers conducted joint operations in the Persian Gulf since 2003, the year the United States invaded Iraq. Stalemate The News -- Britain froze all business ties with Iran as the dispute between the two countries escalated over Iran's seizure of 15 British sailors and marines in the Persian Gulf on March 23. Behind the News -- Iran claims the Britons had penetrated half a kilometer into its waters. Britain released navigational coordinates showing its sailors were nearly 2 miles inside Iraqi waters. Prime Minister Tony Blair warned the dispute would enter a ''different phase'' if the crew was not released; Iran called on Britain to admit fault."
2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"In the library of bad jokes, there are plenty of responses to the immortal question ''How many actors does it take to screw in a light bulb?'' (My personal favorite: Five -- one to screw in the bulb and four to say, ''I could have done that better.'') The issue of just how many actors it takes to make a successful play has no comparably snappy answer. But New York audiences will have the chance this week to evaluate the relative merits of double- and single-digit ensembles with the opening of productions from creators famous for bringing bracing new perspectives to their genres: the South African playwright ATHOL FUGARD and the French composers ALAIN BOUBLIL and CLAUDE-MICHEL SCHÖNBERG. Mr. Boublil and Mr. Schönberg are the fellows who gave the world a strapping new breed of megamusical -- of epic sweep and steamroller score -- in the 1980s with ''Les Misérables'' and ''Miss Saigon.'' Two decades later they are hoping to re-establish themselves as the biggest and splashiest on the block with ''THE PIRATE QUEEN,'' a swaggering tale of love, rivalry and stage-sized boats in the 16th century, written in collaboration with Richard Maltby Jr. Frank Galati (''The Grapes of Wrath'') oversees a cast of 42 -- count 'em, 42. Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100; $51.25 to $111.25. Mr. Fugard has always worked on a canvas that seems diminutive by comparison. But his plays, among the first to deal with the moral consequences of apartheid, have consistently shown that big explosions can come in small packages. His greatest works, including ''Boseman and Lena,'' ''The Island'' and ''Blood Knot,'' have kept the dramatis personae to a potently bare minimum. His new two-character drama, ''EXITS AND ENTRANCES,'' inspired by his relationship with the South African actor Andre Huguenet, opens Wednesday. Stephen Sachs directs Morlan Higgins and William Dennis Hurley in the roles of actor and playwright. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com; $60."

2007-04-01T00:00:00Z,"KOKO TAYLOR, who comes to the B. B. King Blues Club on Friday, has always been a strong woman, the Chicago blues belter who treated the battle of the sexes like an all-out brawl. She has the classic blues pedigree: Born in 1935 near Memphis, she grew up working on a sharecropper's farm before heading for Chicago as a teenager and making her name in the blues. With her gutsy, leathery voice Ms. Taylor turned macho men's songs like ''Wang Dang Doodle'' into her own rough and ready testimonies, and she answered boasts like Muddy Waters's ''Mannish Boy'' with her own ''I'm a Woman,'' vowing, ''I'm an earthshaker.'' No one denied it. In 2003 Ms. Taylor had a medical crisis. After emergency surgery for gastrointestinal bleeding, she wound up unable to breathe, on a ventilator in intensive care. For some time it was uncertain whether she would sing again. But she pulled through, and her first new album since 2000, ''Old School'' (Alligator), tears into its blues with a vengeance. The album includes five new songs of her own -- more than she has written for any of her other albums -- and revives hardheaded lesser-known songs from Willie Dixon, Magic Sam, Memphis Minnie and others. ''You don't want to tangle with me,'' Ms. Taylor sings in ''You Ain't Worth a Good Woman.'' Through the years Ms. Taylor has sometimes simply blustered through songs. On ''Old School'' she's more nuanced and strategic, working her way up before unleashing a rasp. It's a lean, straightforward production -- guitar, piano, bass, drums and an occasional harmonica -- that deliberately looks back to the sound of 1950s and 1960s Chicago blues. Ms. Taylor sounds like she still knows exactly what she wants. Friday, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. 8 p.m.; $33 in advance, $38 Friday."

As a young mathematician at Stanford University in the 1960s, Dr. Cohen studied a question of set theory proposed in the 19th century by the mathematician Georg Cantor. The question, restated by David Hilbert in 1900 and then amplified by the influential logician Kurt Gödel, had been considered a problem of major importance for mathematicians in the 20th century."

The Legislature agreed to Mr. Spitzer's plan to set the nation's highest income ceiling for state-financed health care for children, making it, more than ever, a middle-class entitlement.

2007-04-02T00:00:00Z,"The Ohio State assistant Dan Peters and the Florida assistant Larry Shyatt break down the game from their perspective while other coaches weigh in. By PETE THAMEL LARRY SHYATT Florida assistant Their center is very healthy now, which he was not in December. With young players that they're playing, they're far more experienced after going through one of the best schedules in the country. When you're at the level these two teams are in terms of the talent and coaching ability, it's difficult to change a great deal at the end of the road because you've had so much success and the players have done so well up to that point. They're one of the most up-tempo teams that we played all year. I think our guys are comfortable with that pace. DAN PETERS Ohio State assistant Unfortunately, the officials have a lot to do with the game sometimes. You hope their players adjust quick enough to how they're going to call it. It hurts having officials who don't know how to officiate big guys. Maybe I'm wrong about this, but because kids in the last 10 years in college could leave high school to the N.B.A., you didn't have a lot of big guys. I think most officials know that people come to see the kids play. I told Thad: ''Why don't we walk up to the officials and ask what five minutes is Greg going to play in the first half? The beginning? The middle? Or the end?'' It's hard. That guy wants to play. MATT PAINTER Purdue played Ohio State three times this season and Florida in the second round of the N.C.A.A. tournament. Here is Purdue Coach Matt Painter's take on how the teams match up. It's going to be very important for Ohio State to keep Florida out of transition. I think that Florida has five guys that really push the ball up the floor. They're like piranhas when you take a bad shot, have a long rebound or turn the ball over. Taurean Green and Lee Humphrey feed off the inside-outside game, but they also get a lot of 3s in transition. I would say that Ohio State will try and play this game much more in the halfcourt than the first game because they're going to wait on Greg Oden. They're going to want to wait on their horse. JAY PRICE The Illinois assistant Jay Price saw Ohio State play many times in the Big Ten this season and offered these thoughts on the matchup. It's unbelievable how much better Oden has gotten since the first time these two teams played. He was out of shape and one-handed. He couldn't run up and down the court and was just getting his legs. There's no question that Ohio State is a much better team since it lost at Florida in December. It would not surprise me if Ohio State opened up in a zone. I think they'll mix it up. I thought they did a good job of getting Georgetown off balance with changing defenses. MIKE JONES Georgia played Florida three times this season, and the assistant Mike Jones offered this scouting report on tonight's game. Ohio State really tried to go up-tempo and play fast the first time around. It worked for a little while. It was a pretty close game in the first half, but they ended up losing by around 30. Ohio State will need to play like U.C.L.A. did in the first 10 minutes to have a better chance. It's got to be a brutal, grind-it-out kind of game."

CBS made Mr. Greenfield's appointment official yesterday. It was reported last week in The Washington Post. Mr. Seigenthaler had been the anchor for NBC's weekend newscast since 1999 and had also worked occasionally for NBC's cable news channel MSNBC. But executives at NBC News have said for some time that they have been looking for areas where it can combine jobs. Mr. Seigenthaler, who was well regarded by most of the executives at NBC News, had not been working on many assignments beyond the weekend anchor duties. His contract was expiring, and NBC declined to renew it. Mr. Seigenthaler did not announce any plans for future work, and NBC News has not yet chosen a replacement for him on the weekend anchor desk. But one senior NBC executive said it is likely whoever replaces Mr. Seigenthaler will have a number of other jobs in the news division. In signing on at CBS, where he will work on coverage of the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Greenfield will return to network television, where he was based for 20 years before joining CNN in 1998.

2007-04-03T00:00:00Z,"FLANAGAN - FARRELL-Kathryn Veronica. Kathryn Coady moved through many names in life. Her favorites were Mother and MaMere: Mother to nine, MaMere to 30. To the world, she was Mrs. Flanagan, or Mrs. Flanagan-Farrell, or simply Kate. Let's remember her like that: simply Kate. Kate died of complications from pneumonia on Friday, March 30, in Fairfax, Virginia. Surrounded by her family, she passed with the dignity and strength her generation inspired. She is sleeping now, at 81. Her graceful trip is done. Kate's story is the story of a century. She grew up in Greenwich Village in the 1930s, the daughter of FDNY fire chief Captain John Coady and Cassie O'Brien. One of nine children, Kate met Luis John Flanagan shortly after finishing high school and said ''yes'' when he proposed to her on the Staten Island Ferry, on the same day he graduated from West Point. Barely 18 at the time, Kate waited with her first son until Luis came home wounded from the Battle of the Bulge. After good years in Bridgehampton, NY, and Quincy, MA, Luis accepted a teaching position at the United States Military Academy in 1950. At West Point, Kate raised her nine children, for many years in a white house across the street from the cemetery, a cemetery that filled all too quickly as USMA classes of 1966, 1967, 1968 made their silent return. She raised her kids with elegance and a strong grip, and more than anything she believed in them. She was on their side. Her response when a teacher sent one of her children home with a poor grade? ''Well, she must not know you like I do.'' In 1975, Luis passed after a battle with cancer, and Kate became a single mom. A single mom with three daughters still at home and four little grandchildren already calling her MaMere. A son already at West Point and another headed in that direction. Undeterred, she found a job and bought a redbrick house and began her twelve years as a cadet hostess, grooming homesick cadets for life in the real world. She woke up every morning and drank her coffee and found a way. In 1982, Kate married Edward Leo Farrell, a longtime family friend who fought alongside Luis in World War II. In love again, Kate and Ed travelled to Europe, boated the Hudson, and spent their summers in Cape Cod. Kate turned in her station wagon for a convertible. Ed found a second chance at fatherhood. Widower and widow discovered a new life, and they were happy. When Ed died in 1998, Kate returned to her childhood home of New York City. With flair and a sense of humor, the city girl had returned to her roots for one last show. She would walk to the park and entertain grandchildren visiting her on the upper east side. She would go shopping with her daughters and laugh at the wonder of it all. She often confessed how amazed she was to have started ''all this'' -nine children, thirty grandchildren and now four greatgrandchildren. Our message to her, now that she is gone: there can only ever be one you, Kathryn Coady. And for all of us, you are still here and dancing up a storm. Kathryn is survived by her nine children: Brian Flanagan of Southport, NC; Deirdre FlanaganGaugash of Annapolis, MD; Cassie Sullivan of Fairfax, VA; Patricia Tenney of Ridgefield, CT; Timothy Flanagan of Roxbury, CT; Brendan Flanagan of Peach Tree City, GA; Meaghen FlanaganLeidig of Landenburg, PA; Sheelagh Flanagan of San Francisco, CA; and Brigid Flanagan of New York City, NY. Funeral services will be held on Monday April 9, 2007 at 10:00am at The Chapel of the Most Holy Trinity at the US Military Academy West Point New York. Interment to follow at the Post Cemetery West Point, NY. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Uniformed Fire Fighters Association, Attention: Sheila Pettit, 204 East 23rd St. 5th floor, NY, NY 10010."

The 11 finalists who sang onstage at the Metropolitan Opera on Sunday afternoon had been culled from some 1,500 singers in four rounds of national competition. The six winners took home $15,000 each; the five others, runner-up prizes of $5,000. All got the same boost of singing with the Met orchestra, on the Met stage, for an enthusiastic audience; for most of them, this will lead to new professional opportunities, though there are no instant tickets to a big career. Were they the best young singers in America? Probably not. Some were excellent. Some were all right. No competition is definitive: rather than achievement, the judges can only evaluate a given singer's performance on a given day."

2007-04-04T00:00:00Z,"FEW FIRMS exemplified the previous deal-making boom better than Drexel Burnham Lambert, whose rise and fall in the 1980s was described by James B. Stewart in ''Den of Thieves.'' While that era was marked by criminal prosecutions, notably of Michael R. Milken and Ivan F. Boesky, not all of the players were ''thieves.'' Many know that Mr. Milken has become a philanthropist supporting cancer research, and that Rudolph W. Giuliani, who prosecuted him, is running for president. Here are others from Mr. Stewart's book, with updates: Martin A. Siegel PRISON, AND A STALLED RETURN As an investment banker, he was a star at Kidder Peabody, then Drexel, before pleading guilty to conspiracy and tax evasion. He received a two-month prison sentence, thanks to his cooperation with the government. He resurfaced in the mid-1990s as an adviser to the Ideon Group. But when the board found out about the hire, it insisted that his contract not be renewed. Herald L. Ritch NEVER LEFT THE GAME Then a rising star, he is now a veteran in mergers and acquisitions. In 1988, he joined Freeman Spogli and then served as a top executive at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. He left D.L.J. in 2000, shortly after Credit Suisse acquired it, leading a contingent of defectors to Salomon Smith Barney. He is now president and co-chief executive of Sagent Advisors, a boutique bank. Ivan F. Boesky A LIFE OF SECLUSION His $100 million fine for insider trading has never been surpassed. He served two years in a federal prison after cooperating with prosecutors. In 1993, Mr. Boesky and his wife divorced, and he lost his Westchester County mansion and Park Avenue apartment. Reclusive, he has been seen in New York, France and Switzerland. James Dahl AN ACTIVIST INVESTOR He made a plea agreement with prosecutors. Leaving Drexel in 1990, he moved back to Jacksonville, Fla., his hometown, and set up an investment firm. He was back in the spotlight in the late 1990s through his activism at Gehl, a construction company, after he was refused a board seat. Gehl finally bought his 10 percent stake for $14.9 million. Gary Winnick GLOBAL CROSSING AND AN IMPERIAL LIFESTYLE After leaving Drexel in 1985, he founded the Pacific Capital Group, an investment firm. He then founded Global Crossing, a telecommunications darling of the late 1990s. But the company's fortunes crumbled, culminating in a bankruptcy filing in 2002. Mr. Winnick's imperial lifestyle -- and the lengths he went to preserve it -- angered employees and investors alike. An investigation by the S.E.C. was concluded without any charges against him. Dennis B. Levine AFTER PRISON, CONSULTING He made a deal with prosecutors that resulted in a two-year prison term on perjury, securities fraud and tax evasion charges. When he left prison in 1988, he was barred from associating with broker-dealers. Later, he founded the Adasar Group, a consulting firm named after his two children. Peter J. Solomon WALL STREET WISE MAN Mr. Levine's mentor at Shearson Lehman Brothers, Mr. Solomon left the firm in 1989 to hang his own shingle, the Peter J. Solomon Company. He has since become one of Wall Street's gray eminences. His firm has recently advised on deals that include Kate Spade, Lands' End and Barneys New York. Lawrence B. Pedowitz REPRESENTED MARTHA STEWART Still a partner at the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. But his post-Milken highlight may be his role on Martha Stewart's defense team. With a partner, John Savarese, he helped negotiate a deal with federal prosecutors: Ms. Stewart would plead guilty to one felony count of making a false statement to federal agents, according to a 2004 New Yorker article. Ms. Stewart did not take the deal, went to trial and ended up being convicted. Harvey Pitt SERVED AS S.E.C. CHAIRMAN In 2001, he was appointed chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, leading it during Sept. 11, the collapse of Enron and the wave of scandals that led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. But he resigned in 2003 amid controversy over one of his appointments. He is now runs Kalorama Partners, a consulting firm. Linda Gosden Robinson STILL IN PUBLIC RELATIONS She was Mr. Milken's spokeswoman in the 1980s. As chairwoman of Robinson Lerer & Montgomery, she has represented clients like Pfizer and Morgan Stanley. Her firm was acquired by Young & Rubicam, which itself was then bought by the WPP Group of Britain. She also serves as a director of Revlon and BlackRock. Kenneth Lerer INTERNET EXECUTIVE He quickly moved from representing business moguls to becoming one himself. While still president of Robinson Lerer & Montgomery, he became senior vice president of America Online, and then an executive vice president of Time Warner. He has since moved to newer media: in 2005, he co-founded the Huffington Post Web site with Arianna Huffington. (Pages are from ''Den of Thieves,'' by James B. Stewart. Copyright c1991 by James. B.

Because CBS's broadcast was live, Nielsen's preliminary estimates for the game's audience are unreliable, but Florida's victory over Ohio State appeared to dominate the television competition from 9:15 to 11:30 p.m., faring significantly better in the ratings than the year-ago championship game. ABC was most dominant earlier in the night as a 105-minute episode of ''Dancing With the Stars'' earned approximately 17.1 million viewers from 8 to 9:45. Following it on ABC, the debut of ''The Bachelor: Officer and a Gentleman,'' the 10th iteration of the series, garnered more than 10 million viewers from 9:45 to 11.

2007-04-04T00:00:00Z,"THE merger boom has created a subplot perfect for a spy thriller: a proliferation of code names that executives and investment bankers use to disguise the parties in a potential deal. Often inspired by Greek gods, sports figures or city names, the code names turn up in early presentations in place of actual company names, which, at least in theory, are supposed to stay secret until an agreement is announced. A common approach is to substitute a word with the same first letter of each company, although deal makers sometimes get more fanciful."

And if these women took hormone therapy, their risk was higher still. ''The main indication now for hormone therapy is hot flashes and night sweats,'' said Dr. Jacques Rossouw, a researcher for the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute who directed the federal study, the Women's Health Initiative.

One Easter, on a farm outside the old Samnite town of Venafro in Molise, I shared a 40-egg frittata made by the farmer's wife. It wasn't the best frittata I ever had, but it surely was the holiest. As the dull winter landscape of the Mediterranean breaks into fresh green life, the exuberance of holiday feasting neatly matches the exuberance of nature. The magic and mystery of Easter and Passover are firmly grounded in the realities of a Mediterranean springtime. The artichokes, asparagus, young fava beans and fresh green peas on the Easter table reflect that, as do the eggs that have piled up, uneaten throughout Lent, in the family larder."

(13) IN PERFORMANCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE -- Starting in 1978 with a recital by the pianist Vladimir Horowitz, and continuing with performers ranging from the United States Marine Band to the singer Natalie Cole, this series has celebrated the breadth of American music. Tonight it honors the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, a nonprofit education organization founded in 1986 by the Monk family and Maria Fisher, an opera singer, to offer young musicians college-level training from jazz masters and to bring jazz into public schools. Musicians including Clark Terry, above, perform for President and Mrs. Bush; Barbara Walters is host. 8 P.M. (CW) AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL -- Exactly how skinny was she?

(49) NOVEL REFLECTIONS ON THE AMERICAN DREAM -- There was a time when the country's collective ambitions -- and subsequent despairs -- were fodder for great literature. Take John Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath,'' which confronted an inconvenient truth: it sometimes takes more than hard work and clean living to get ahead. When it was published in 1939, the novel was criticized as being full of lies, corruption and Communistic themes. It sold out in a flash. This special looks at seven stories that dared to challenge the fiction of the American dream: works from Theodore Dreiser's ''Sister Carrie'' and Edith Wharton's ''House of Mirth'' to F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby'' (above, a scene from a re-enactment) and Saul Bellow's ''Seize the Day.''

Mr. Zelenovic, who was named in a landmark indictment that for the first time charged rape and sexual enslavement as a crime against humanity, was deported from Russia last June after being discovered in Siberia under a false name. He pleaded guilty in January. The judges convicted him of personally committing nine rapes in apartments and an abandoned house in Foca and involvement in three others. “The scars left by the sexual assaults were deep and might never heal,” the presiding judge, Alphons Orie, said as the sentence was handed down. “This perhaps more than anything speaks about the gravity of the crimes in this case.”."
