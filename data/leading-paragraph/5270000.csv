Mr. Tarkovsky, who died in 1986, was known for powerful, sometimes violent images and big, sometimes mystical symbols. This very early work, made in 1960 during his final year at the Moscow Film Institute and not shown in New York until now, is a small story told through the eyes of a small boy. The focus is on a few hours that Sasha, a 7-year-old violin student, spends in the company of a steamroller driver named Sergei. Sasha, though spunky, is a privileged child who is picked on by the rougher kids in his apartment house. Sergei, who comes to his defense and lets him operate the steamroller, seems a sort of hero, a stand-in perhaps for the father who never appears. To Sergei, we sense, the boy represents a future that is beyond a mere worker."

1988-04-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: It is not particularly the fault of Lawrence Foster and his Monte Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra that their Carnegie Hall concert Sunday afternoon prompted thoughts less about the specifics of the program at hand than about the international symphonic scene. The playing was good: very good indeed in the hushed, well-sustained slow movement of Dukas's Symphony in C; more than adequate everywhere else."

Guitar-twang speech, a harmonic convergence of it, is all around. Red and gold, colors of good luck, flare up. And this wild variegation, alongside the jagged Chinese writing, cuts against architectural regularity."
1988-04-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: As recently as the early 1960's, new science fiction meant short fiction. Except for an occasional novel marketed as something else, new s.f. appeared mostly in monthly magazines where the longest stories were chopped into three or four parts for serialization.

1988-05-06T00:00:00Z,"''Sticky Fingers'' is the work of a female director (Catlin Adams), female screenwriters (Miss Adams and Melanie Mayron) and a mostly female cast (including supporting players like Eileen Brennan, Gwen Welles and Carol Kane), but it's less feminist than dizzily feminine. The two leading characters, struggling musicians sharing a picturesquely shabby downtown flat, are as bubble headed as they can be. This is especially apparent after fate sends a suitcase full of money their way, courtesy of a drug-dealing friend (Loretta Devine) who asks them to watch it for an indefinite period. What do they do about this windfall? They shriek, they squabble and then they shop. Helen Slater and Melanie Mayron, careening through the film in the kinds of zany ''Desperately Seeking Susan''-inspired outfits that are fun as long as they're on somebody else, play the blithe Hattie and Lolly at a screwball pitch. To enhance this, Miss Adams often directs them to talk frenetically at the same time, and she establishes the characters' charming eccentricity with cute shots of their unusual shoes. A lot of care has gone into the film's earring wardrobe, too. So ''Sticky Fingers'' tries too hard, but it does have a fundamental good-naturedness that comes through."
