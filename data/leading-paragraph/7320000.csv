2010-01-29T16:37:54Z,"Karmically speaking, we have to guess that the Sundance Film Festival is in pretty good shape. The Dalai Lama sent a ""message of peace,"" which was broadcast during the Music 4 Peace Initiative press conference, an event attended by Dr. Arun Gandhi, the Def Jam founder Russell Simmons and the civil rights leader Dr. Benjamin Chavis, Jr. (Music 4 Peace also sponsored an appearance by Pras, the Haitian former member of the Fugees, who performed for Haitian Relief.) Less divinely, but only slightly, Robert Redford came down from the mountain last night to sit in on a panel with the author Naomi Klein and the director Michael Winterbottom, who together made ""The Shock Doctrine,"" a documentary about Milton Friedman, the Chicago School of Economics, third-world corporate oppression and how countries like Haiti get that way. Great stuff. And if the connections with American independent cinema seem a bit, shall we say, loose, well that's all part of the Great Wheel of Life in Park City, Utah.But it's hardly a big mystery. When people whisper about the ""dirty little secret"" of Sundance (the jaded will say, ""Uh, which one?""), they're usually talking about something else: that the documentaries are better than the features? (Yawn.) That the festival is as much about stars as anywhere else? (No kidding.) That when a film is introduced by someone who says, ""It went through the Sundance lab ... but that's not why it's here,"" you know that's exactly why it's here? Old news. How about the fact that the festival's Volunteer Appreciation Day was celebrated Wednesday with the same enthusiasm that prison inmates would celebrate Corrections Officer Day?

Comfort"" (06:40)Brent and Craig Renaud have produced a remarkably intimate and detailed look at the challenges faced by rescuers in Haiti, from the vantage of the U.S. Naval Ship Comfort, a hospital ship anchored off Port-au-Prince. The video takes us inside the ship, where the crew works around the clock to save the lives of those injured in the quake. But we also learn about the difficulties of logistics on the ground, when it becomes clear that the lawn of the ideally situated National Palace cannot be used as a military heliport - to airlift the injured and dying to the ship - because the symbolism is so politically fraught. The scenes aboard the ship are heart-rending. We meet Corpsman Christopher Brossard, a Haitian-American who comforts a severely injured woman whose foot almost certainly has to be amputated. Scenes are expertly composed and moments that might otherwise be gruesome are infused with a tragic tenderness. These moments can be hard to watch, but they are a necessary part of telling a story like this one. (E.O.)"

The Times-Picayune reported that the New Orleans Museum of Art and the Indianapolis Museum of Art have placed a friendly wager on the outcome of the big game on Feb. 7: if the New Orleans Saints win, the Indianapolis museum will send ""The Fifth Plague of Egypt"" -- that is, the landscape from its collection painted by J.M.W. Turner in 1800 -- to the New Orleans museum, which gets to show it for three months. If the Indianapolis Colts prevail, the New Orleans institution will send the painting ""Ideal View of Tivoli,"" a 1644 work by Claude Lorrain, to Indianapolis for three months. The Times-Picayune said the bet was instigated by Tyler Green, who writes the Modern Art Notes blog for artsjournal.com, and who helped egg on some tongue-in-cheek trash talk between the museums' directors. When E. John Bullard, the New Orleans museum director, offered to wager a valuable Renoir, his Indianapolis counterpart, Maxwell Anderson, dismissed it as a ""sentimental blancmange"". Mr. Bullard replied: ""I am amused that Renoir is too sweet for Indianapolis. Does this mean that those Indiana corn farmers have simpler tastes?"""

2010-01-29T00:00:00Z,"BAKER--C. Edwin (Ed). A public Memorial Service honoring the life of C. Edwin (Ed) Baker will be held Sunday, January 31 in the Moot Court Room at Cardozo School of Law, 55 Fifth Avenue (5th Ave. at 12th St.), New York City at 2pm. Professor Baker, age 62, died unexpectedly on December 8, 2009. At the time of his death he was the Nicholas F. Gallicchio Professor of Law and Professor of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. He also held a joint appointment at Penn's Annenberg School of Communications. Ed Baker was one of the nation's leading constitutional law and media policy scholars. He published four books, Media Concentration and Democracy: Why Ownership Matters (Cambridge, 2007), Media, Markets, and Democracy (Cambridge, 2002), Advertising and a Democratic Press (Princeton, 1994), and Human Liberty and Freedom of Speech (Oxford, 1989). He also authored over 70 articles and book chapters, as well as numerous op-ed pieces, including two in the New York Times. Yale Professor Jack Balkin describes Ed Baker as ""the finest media law scholar of his generation."" Professor Monroe Price, the director of the Annenberg Center for Global Communication Studies states: ""There was no scholar so committed, passionate, disciplined and wise in thinking through the relationship between the media and the political system."" Professor Robert McChesney of SavetheNews.org writes that: ""It is impossible to gauge the immensity of the loss with Ed Baker's passing. His commitment to a strong free press and a vibrant democracy guided all of his work."" Baker's most recent work focused on equality and on the threats to democracy posed by the concentration of media ownership, the subject of his recent testimony before Congress. Raised in Madisonville, Kentucky, Ed Baker was a graduate of Stanford University and Yale College of Law. He was a fellow at Harvard three times, most recently at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. He was a resident of Greenwich Village for over 20 years. Ed was predeceased by his parents, Falcon O. and Ernestine Magagna Baker. He is survived by his sister, Dr. Nancy Lynn Baker of El Granada, CA, a professor at Fielding Graduate University, her spouse Cathy Hauer, seven first cousins, a number of close longtime friends, and his girlfriend Jennifer Mathews. His cremated remains will be interred in April in Madisonville, KY. Memorial Contributions in his honor should be made to the ACLU, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Oxfam, or another charity honoring Ed's commitment to human rights and free speech."

Carolyn was surrounded by her loving husband, John H. Daly; their five children; two grandchildren, and a daughter-in-law and son-in-law. Carolyn was born on March 1, 1926 in Brooklyn, NY. She was the youngest child (with her twin brother Ralph) of the late Ralph and Carolyn (Kirwin) Keating of Scarsdale, NY. Carolyn was raised in Scarsdale, NY, and graduated from Scarsdale High School. Carolyn then attended and graduated from Trinity College, a women's college in Washington, DC, where she majored in English. Following college, Carolyn was employed by Look Magazine in New York City prior to her marriage on June 23, 1951. Following her marriage, Carolyn was employed at Lafayette College in Easton, PA, until the birth of her first child, John M. Daly. Following her last child's graduation from college, Carolyn worked for many years as Administrative Assistant to the Pastor at the Palmer Moravian Church in Palmer Township, PA. Carolyn was very active in her community, serving as a Trustee of the YWCA of Easton, PA, and as a member of the Board of Managers for The Easton Home. In 1991, Carolyn was honored for her many years of service to the American Association of University Women with an AAUW national graduate grant awarded in her name by the Eleanor Roosevelt Fund.

Carolyn loved literature, symphony, theater, opera, and ballet, as well as LaFayette basketball which she followed closely. Carolyn enjoyed sports, including bowling and golf, and for several seasons coached a girl's softball team in Palmer Township, PA. Carolyn's greatest joy came from spending time with her beloved husband, children, and grandchildren, at family gatherings on holidays and summer vacations each year. Carolyn was truly the center of her family, around whom all activities revolved. She enjoyed a wide circle of friends throughout her life, all of whom will remember her for her kindness, great sense of humor, commitment to her Catholic faith, dignity, and strength of character. Her memory will live on in the hearts of all who knew her. Carolyn is survived by her husband, John H. Daly, recently of Nazareth, PA (formerly of Easton, PA); three sons, John M. Daly, of Union City, NJ; David M. Daly, of Keyport, NJ; and James C. Daly, of Indianapolis, IN; two daughters, Mary Einkauf, of Acton, MA; and Ann P. Daly, of Topsfield, MA.

2010-01-30T00:00:00Z,"It’s not only mayors and inveterate gamblers who place bets on the Super Bowl — art museums do, too. The Times-Picayune of New Orleans reported that the New Orleans Museum of Art and the Indianapolis Museum of Art have placed a friendly wager on the outcome of the big game on Feb. 7: if the New Orleans Saints win, the Indianapolis museum will send “The Fifth Plague of Egypt” — that is, the landscape from its collection painted by J.M.W. Turner in 1800 — to the New Orleans museum, which gets to hang it for three months. If the Indianapolis Colts prevail, the New Orleans institution will send the painting “Ideal View of Tivoli,” a 1644 work by Claude Lorrain, to Indianapolis for three months. The Times-Picayune said the bet was instigated by Tyler Green, who writes the Modern Art Notes blog for artsjournal.com, and who helped egg on some tongue-in-cheek trash talk between the museums’ directors. When E. John Bullard, the New Orleans museum director, offered to wager a valuable Renoir, his Indianapolis counterpart, Maxwell Anderson, dismissed it as a “sentimental blancmange.” Mr. Bullard replied: “I am amused that Renoir is too sweet for Indianapolis. Does this mean that those Indiana corn farmers have simpler tastes?”."

The son of Milton and Gerta Herzon and raised in Erie, PA, Bert began his university studies at Harvard at the very young age of 15, transferred to the Honors Program at Swarthmore College, graduating in 1932 and completed his medical education at Johns Hopkins in 1937. Following a residency at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital and further training at Bellevue Hospital and the New York State Psychiatric Hospital, Bert served with the U.S. Army, first evaluating the mental fitness of draftees and then with the 10th Armored Division as a neuropsychiatrist (seeing active combat during the Battle of the Bulge); at war's end, he was called to serve at the Nuremberg trials and then served on the denazification process for the American Military Government, service which lead to the publication of his seminal work Father Land (1948) widely used in University courses and by those setting up anti-nazi democratic systems in Germany. After the war, Bert took further training with the William Alanson White Institute in New York City, with which he was associated for most of his career as a psychiatrist, teaching, advising and leading. During these years he was active in promoting mental health initiatives in the Caribbean, serving on the Expert Committee for Mental Health of the United Nations, advising the British, French and Dutch island governments in the West Indies on their mental health programs, and assisting numerous other international organizations. Never abandoning his private psychiatric practice, he was a leader in the study of the problems of homosexual practitioners in the medical world; he was proud of being one of the very first doctors to treat AIDS patients, writing articles seeking more humane attitudes and treatment for them, and from the 1980's forward, he dedicated much of his professional efforts to helping HIV/AIDS patients and the health care providers who ministered to them, continuing to receive patients at his home office until shortly before his death. Also well known as a collector of Indian art, an interest spurred by his participation in a Brooklyn Museum trip to India in 1966, Dr. Schaffner travelled often to the subcontinent and became a beloved member of the arts community in New York, serving on the Collections Committee of The Brooklyn Museum, to which he was both devoted and one of its major donors. Author, prizewinner, compassionate psychiatrist and a model of what it means to be a friend, Bert is survived by his sister-in-law, Mrs. Robert Edward Schaffner, two nieces, and many cousins in all parts of the country, as well as a host of professional colleagues and close friends from all walks of life.

Edwin (Ed) Baker will be held Sunday, January 31 in the Moot Court Room at Cardozo School of Law, 55 Fifth Avenue (5th Ave. at 12th St.), New York City at 2pm. Professor Baker, age 62, died unexpectedly on December 8, 2009. At the time of his death he was the Nicholas F. Gallicchio Professor of Law and Professor of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. He also held a joint appointment at Penn's Annenberg School of Communications. Ed Baker was one of the nation's leading constitutional law and media policy scholars. He published four books, Media Concentration and Democracy: Why Ownership Matters (Cambridge, 2007), Media, Markets, and Democracy (Cambridge, 2002), Advertising and a Democratic Press (Princeton, 1994), and Human Liberty and Freedom of Speech (Oxford, 1989). He also authored over 70 articles and book chapters, as well as numerous op-ed pieces, including two in the New York Times. Yale Professor Jack Balkin describes Ed Baker as ""the finest media law scholar of his generation."" Professor Monroe Price, the director of the Annenberg Center for Global Communication Studies states: ""There was no scholar so committed, passionate, disciplined and wise in thinking through the relationship between the media and the political system."" Professor Robert McChesney of SavetheNews.org writes that: ""It is impossible to gauge the immensity of the loss with Ed Baker's passing. His commitment to a strong free press and a vibrant democracy guided all of his work."" Baker's most recent work focused on equality and on the threats to democracy posed by the concentration of media ownership, the subject of his recent testimony before Congress. Raised in Madisonville, Kentucky, Ed Baker was a graduate of Stanford University and Yale College of Law. He was a fellow at Harvard three times, most recently at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. He was a resident of Greenwich Village for over 20 years. Ed was predeceased by his parents, Falcon O. and Ernestine Magagna Baker. He is survived by his sister, Dr. Nancy Lynn Baker of El Granada, CA, a professor at Fielding Graduate University, her spouse Cathy Hauer, seven first cousins, a number of close longtime friends, and his girlfriend Jennifer Mathews. His cremated remains will be interred in April in Madisonville, KY. Memorial Contributions in his honor should be made to the ACLU, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Oxfam, or another charity honoring Ed's commitment to human rights and free speech."

All the lawyers and staff of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP mourn the loss of their partner Bob Joffe, a friend and mentor who was a preeminent litigator and boardroom adviser. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife and family to whom he was so devoted. Mr. Joffe was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in August 2009 and died in New York, NY on January 28. He was 66 years old. Over the course of his extraordinary career, Mr. Joffe was well- known nationally and internationally, both for his tenacity in handling landmark litigation and for his ability to provide highly sensitive counsel in the boardrooms of corporate America. Since 1978, Mr. Joffe was the primary outside lawyer for Time Warner. One of the many significant matters he handled was the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. He was the principal litigator for Time Inc. in successfully rebutting Paramount's 1989 attempted takeover in a case considered to be a milestone in M&A litigation. Mr. Joffe represented the Boards of Directors of some of the world's most prominent companies in connection with their most pressing challenges, especially during the recent financial crisis. He was a longtime advisor to the non-management directors of Fannie Mae and was also counsel to the independent directors of Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, General Electric and General Motors, among many others. Mr. Joffe was passionate about human rights even as a student at Harvard Law School. From 1967 to 1969, after just a few months as a Cravath associate, Mr. Joffe left New York to serve in the Ministry of Justice of the Government of Malawi on an Africa Asia Public Service Fellowship funded by the Ford Foundation. It was in this position that he assisted the Commissioner for Law Revision in rewriting the country's laws and instituting a framework for supervision of the local courts for this African country. He continued his interest in civil rights and, in 1989, he argued Martin v. Wilks, a pro bono civil rights case in the United States Supreme Court in which he represented black and women municipal employees in Birmingham, Alabama, in an effort to secure equal opportunity in employment. In later years, as Cravath's Presiding Partner, Mr. Joffe was a strong promoter of the need for lawyers to treat pro bono clients with equal regard and concern as they would any paying client. Mr. Joffe became a partner at Cravath in 1975. He was elected Deputy Presiding Partner in 1997 and became Cravath's Presiding Partner in 1999. Mr. Joffe served as the Firm's leader until December 31, 2006. Mr. Joffe was a beloved and devoted husband, father and son. He is survived by his wife Virginia (Dinny), two children, Katherine Joffe (New York, NY) and David Joffe (New York, NY) and two stepchildren, Dr. Ryan DeHaas (Concord, NC) and Elizabeth DeHass (New York, NY). He is also survived by his mother, Bertha Joffe, and two brothers, Paul Joffe (Washington, DC) and Richard Joffe (New York, NY). A memorial service will be held to celebrate his life on Wednesday, February 10th at 11am at All Souls Church, 1157 Lexington Ave. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Human Rights First, 333 Seventh Ave., 13th Floor, New York, NY 10001 or to The After-School Corporation, 1440 Broadway, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10018."

If a single year has so transformed his political fortunes, imagine what cannot be imagined in the next three ahead. If it's any comfort, the phenomenon isn't new to the American presidency. To quote the favorite political philosopher of the president I served, it's déjà vu all over again. Travel back to January 1990, as President George Bush -- no ''H. W.'' needed back then -- prepared for his first State of the Union address. The invasion of Panama, which returned democracy to that nation by way of the barrel speakers of a boom-box, had officially ended after 23 days. The Revolutions of 1989 across Europe -- in the speech, the president told of a Czech Everyman reciting in accented English the words of the Declaration of Independence -- served to underscore the president's claim that the State of our Union was strong."

He was also a life trustee of the ATS National Board of Regents, served on the Technion Board of Governors, and was a regular participant on ATS missions to Israel and the Technion.

This winter the optimists are holding their own with their bright, freshly colored lumberjack looks, although the traditional Paul Bunyan checks are still a force to be reckoned with. But what catches the eye are the cheerful Day-Glo versions worn by young people, for whom ''log'' is computer talk. The bold squares of their inexpensive ear-flap caps and shirt-style jackets, with their distant and romantic connection to the forest, enliven a city where basic black is the rule."

2010-01-31T00:00:00Z,"Barack Obama, reeling from the Democratic defeat in the Massachusetts Senate race, isn't the first president to get an unwelcome anniversary gift a year after taking office. On Jan. 20, 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno announced that, at President Bill Clinton's request, she had appointed Robert Fiske as special counsel to investigate the Whitewater case. What we didn't know then was that seven months later, Mr. Fiske would be replaced by Ken Starr, whose investigation would ultimately lead to the president's impeachment. But what those of us on the Clinton staff were learning fast after 12 tumultuous months on the job was how little control we had over our own unfolding drama. The cockiness of the campaign was giving way to a humility imposed by history. Events large and small -- and so often out of our hands -- could unfurl without warning, or sometimes over time, to upend our day, alter our political fortunes and change the world. In that first year, they often did."

Last Christmas Day, Amazon sold more e-books for its Kindle reader than regular books. A first. This happened just days after Laredo, Tex., a city of nearly a quarter-million people, shuttered its last standing bookstore, becoming the first metropolis of that size to be barren of books sold the old-fashioned way. Amazon's triumph and Laredo's loss are linked, many would say -- the Web robo-seller crushing the quirky corner bookstore. And it can only get worse, the pessimists have it, with Apple moving aggressively into e-reading with an iBooks reader as part of its sexy and slender tablet."

Great American jazz figures were there. Musicians played Ellington songs arranged by Gerry Mulligan. Joe Williams and Mary Mayo sang. Ellington danced with Rose Mary Woods. After dinner, the president had a nightcap with the pianist Earl Hines. It was in many other ways a very good year for President Nixon. He called to congratulate the Apollo 11 astronauts on their moon landing. He initiated a huge expansion of the National Endowment for the Arts and began the processes that led to the desegregation of public schools in the South and a historic reform of the government's policy toward American Indians.

2010-01-31T00:00:00Z,"THINGS were tough as Jimmy Carter prepared for his 1978 State of the Union address, one year into his term. But they seemed, strangely, hopeful. The president's big domestic initiative that year was a national energy policy. The gas-station lines and first-ever spike in fuel prices in the mid-1970s made this a genuine emergency. He hadn't yet gotten the whole plan through, but the previous summer he had signed legislation creating the Department of Energy and begun imposing standards that, even after he was gone, kept improving the fuel efficiency of American cars, buildings and factories. His big foreign policy initiative was the Panama Canal treaty, to restore Panama's sovereignty over the Canal Zone with safeguards for the canal's operation. Although the opponents were fierce, employing what we would now call ''tea party'' tactics, they were a minority. Mr. Carter had John Wayne and other tough guys to speak on the treaty's behalf -- not to mention 61 Democratic votes in the Senate and a more than 2-to-1 Democratic majority under Tip O'Neill in the House."

But the 1980 Republican platform bore a simple five-word title: ''Family, Neighborhood, Work, Peace, Freedom,'' and was planned and written with the purpose of creating an agenda for a Reagan administration on Day One, Jan. 20, 1981. My signal memory of Reagan's first year in office is that we were actually able to stick to the plan that he insisted we put in place. Coupled with the basic policy framework, Reagan's was one of the most carefully planned presidential transitions in modern political history, replete with teams of ''Reaganauts'' dispatched to each department and agency in the days following the election. Staffing lists were compiled, and presidential and subcabinet appointments were made swiftly, background and vetting checks completed and requisite Senate hearings scheduled."

I remember thinking it seemed fitting. ''What a year,'' President Bush said during dinner. ''Sometimes it seems like seven,'' replied Condoleezza Rice, his national security advisor. But no one else said much. The emotions had been too raw, too intense. The sudden horror of Sept. 11 had changed the course of the presidency, making America's national security the president's relentless focus. ''Continued vigilance'' were the watchwords, as we fully expected additional attacks. We had seen the president's strong leadership as he rallied the country, Congress and each of us to confront the threat. ''Let me tell you how to do your job today,'' I remember him saying to me early one morning, directing me to plan an announcement. We had watched Mr. Bush make the most profound decision a commander in chief can make, committing American lives to battle in Afghanistan. We had witnessed the fall of the Taliban and worked to calm the panic of anthrax attacks."

2010-01-31T00:00:00Z,"OSTERMAN--Marjorie Korn, novelist and playwright, wife of three time Tony award-winning Broadway producer, Lester Osterman, died age 92 at the Jewish Home for the Elderly, Fairfield, Connecticut. Born August 23, 1917, she attended Smith College and Barnard College, Columbia. Her novel, ""Damned If You Do, Damned If You Don't"" (1962) and was a National Library Selection. The New York Times' reviewer commented: ""Without sentimentality, prejudice or treacle, she gives the lives and loves of a Jewish merchant dynasty from the civil war to World War II... Fiction either imitates life or captures it... Marjorie Osterman captures it."" Her full length play, ""A Scent of Almonds"", about the stain a Nazi governess lays on a New York Jewish girl, was produced in 1986. ""There are moments of gnawing pain, and guilt surges up around five of the six characters like the waters of an engulfing flood,"" said the Times review. ""Merely raising the kinds of questions Ms. Osterman does is an extraordinary and even courageous act. One is not likely to forget it soon."" Her short stories and poetry appeared in New Voices, the American Vanguard, Sports Illustrated, McCalls's and Mademoiselle. She is survived by her daughter and son-in-law Patricia and John Thackray of Manhattan, her son and daughter-in-law Tom and Phyllis Osterman of Stamford CT, and by seven grandchildren, Sunshine Osterman-Ball, Heather Osterman-Davis, Sam Osterman, Charlie Osterman; Shelia Bagdade and Natasha Gray; and three great-grandchildren. A funeral service will be held on Sunday, January 31, 2010 at 11am at the Leo P. Gallagher & Son Funeral Home, 2900 Summer Street, Stamford, CT.

2010-01-31T00:00:00Z,"CAHILL--Sarah du Pont, ""Sally"", age 80, died peacefully Sunday, January 24, 2010 after a lengthy illness, surrounded by her loving family, at RiverMead, in Peterborough, NH. Born in 1929 and raised in Wilmington, DE, she was the daughter of Emile F. du Pont and Sarah Dure Townsend du Pont. Sally attended the Tower Hill School in Wilmington followed by Miss Porter's School in Farmington, CT, where she served as President of the School her senior year in 1947. She graduated from Bennett Junior College in Millbrook, NY. Sally lived a life of service and leadership. For more than 50 years she was very involved with Miss Porter's School, where she received the school's highest honor for distinguished service. She was a Trustee from 1993 to 1999, and until recently, served on various alumnae, class and development committees. She was part of a strong family tradition, her mother, aunt, daughter and granddaughter all having attended Miss Porter's. Other roles of leadership and service included Deacon, Member of the Finance Committee and Sunday School Teacher at the Wellesley Congregational Church, Wellesley MA; Hospice Worker for over a decade at Norwood Hospital in Norwood, MA; Trustee, Member of the Corporation and Chair of Planned Giving at the Joslin Diabetes Foundation; Trustee of the Stoddard Congregational Church; Secretary of the Stoddard Historical Society; and numerous volunteer positions in area hospitals, schools and in her local community. Sally was a devoted wife and mother. She met her husband of 60 years, Dr. George F. Cahill, Jr., during college week in Bermuda in 1947, and they married two years later. She was very supportive of her husband who has had a distinguished career in medicine. She accompanied him around the world as he shared his medical expertise, and he credits his professional success to her unwavering support, grace, and ease in any situation. They lived in New York City in the early 1950s, followed by Wellesley and Needham MA, raising six children, four girls and two boys. Love of nature and the outdoors brought them to Stoddard, New Hampshire in the 1980's where they built a home on property they had owned since the mid- 1960's and had used as a weekend and vacation retreat. Sally had a deep love and commitment to the natural world and to all living creatures. She created an extensive catalogue of wildflower photographs, accompanied by her observations and research, which was recently printed. In addition to her husband George, of Stoddard and Peterborough, NH, Sally is survived by her children, Colly Remley, Green Bay, WI, Peter Cahill, Los Gatos, CA, George (Chip) Cahill, Bellevue, WA, Rhett Cahill, Acton, MA, Eva Cahill, Calais, VT, Beth Tiedemann, NYC, their spouses and 15 grandchildren. She is also survived by her brothers, Francis I. du Pont, Chadds Ford, PA and Peter R. du Pont and wife Jeanie, NYC. A memorial service is being held on February 1st at 1:00pm at the Union Congregational Church, 33 Concord Rd. Peterborough, NH. An interment service will take place later this spring at the Stoddard Congregational Church.

2010-01-31T00:00:00Z,"JOFFE--Robert D. All the lawyers and staff of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP mourn the loss of their partner Bob Joffe, a friend and mentor who was a preeminent litigator and boardroom adviser. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife and family to whom he was so devoted. Mr. Joffe was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in August 2009 and died in New York, NY on January 28. He was 66 years old. Over the course of his extraordinary career, Mr. Joffe was well- known nationally and internationally, both for his tenacity in handling landmark litigation and for his ability to provide highly sensitive counsel in the boardrooms of corporate America. Since 1978, Mr. Joffe was the primary outside lawyer for Time Warner. One of the many significant matters he handled was the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. He was the principal litigator for Time Inc. in successfully rebutting Paramount's 1989 attempted takeover in a case considered to be a milestone in M&A litigation. Mr. Joffe represented the Boards of Directors of some of the world's most prominent companies in connection with their most pressing challenges, especially during the recent financial crisis. He was a longtime advisor to the non-management directors of Fannie Mae and was also counsel to the independent directors of Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, General Electric and General Motors, among many others. Mr. Joffe was passionate about human rights even as a student at Harvard Law School. From 1967 to 1969, after just a few months as a Cravath associate, Mr. Joffe left New York to serve in the Ministry of Justice of the Government of Malawi on an Africa Asia Public Service Fellowship funded by the Ford Foundation. It was in this position that he assisted the Commissioner for Law Revision in rewriting the country's laws and instituting a framework for supervision of the local courts for this African country. He continued his interest in civil rights and, in 1989, he argued Martin v. Wilks, a pro bono civil rights case in the United States Supreme Court in which he represented black and women municipal employees in Birmingham, Alabama, in an effort to secure equal opportunity in employment. In later years, as Cravath's Presiding Partner, Mr. Joffe was a strong promoter of the need for lawyers to treat pro bono clients with equal regard and concern as they would any paying client. Mr. Joffe became a partner at Cravath in 1975. He was elected Deputy Presiding Partner in 1997 and became Cravath's Presiding Partner in 1999. Mr. Joffe served as the Firm's leader until December 31, 2006. Mr. Joffe was a beloved and devoted husband, father and son. He is survived by his wife Virginia (Dinny), two children, Katherine Joffe (New York, NY) and David Joffe (New York, NY) and two stepchildren, Dr. Ryan DeHaas (Concord, NC) and Elizabeth DeHass (New York, NY), and two grandchildren. He is also survived by his mother, Bertha Joffe, and two brothers, Paul Joffe (Washington, DC) and Richard Joffe (New York, NY). A memorial service will be held to celebrate his life on Wednesday, February 10th at 11am at All Souls Church, 1157 Lexington Ave. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Human Rights First, 333 Seventh Ave., 13th Floor, New York, NY 10001 or to The After-School Corporation, 1440 Broadway, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10018."

The tail, an ordinary brown one, was sticking out of the dressing room next door. I never did see the dog's body or the master of the animal, who was, presumably, deciding whether to buy just the black T-shirt, or the red one as well.

Larry had a passionate commitment to his students, to the schools where he taught and to the English language itself. This passion, combined with Larry's irresistible yet somewhat unique and twisted sense of humor, made the world of literature an accessible place of wonder for the countless students he taught in his 30 years as a teacher. Larry taught English at Northfield Mount Hermon from 1979 until 1995. He then worked briefly for the State of Massachusetts giving high school students the opportunity to experience work situations. Larry then went back to teaching English at Eaglebrook, a boarding and day school for boys in grades six to nine, where he continued to inspire his students until his illness made it too difficult for him to get to his classroom. Larry demanded and brought out the best in his students. He shared with them his wide range of interests from James Joyce and William Butler Yeats to Groucho Marx and W.C. Fields, from Richard Wagner to early jazz and Klesmer music. Larry is survived by his mother Blanche Friedman, his sister and her husband, Ellen Friedman and Jeffrey Cowan, nieces Rachel Friedman and her husband, Christopher Wallwork, Celia and Molly Friedman Cowan and nephew Sam Friedman Cowan and his aunt Marie Alpert.

2010-01-31T00:00:00Z,"SCHAFFNER--Dr. Bertram H. Schaffner, 97, renowned as a psychiatrist and widely known as a collector of Indian art, died in his sleep on January 29, 2010. The son of Milton and Gerta Herzon and raised in Erie, PA, Bert began his university studies at Harvard at the very young age of 15, transferred to the Honors Program at Swarthmore College, graduating in 1932 and completed his medical education at Johns Hopkins in 1937. Following a residency at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital and further training at Bellevue Hospital and the New York State Psychiatric Hospital, Bert served with the U.S. Army, first evaluating the mental fitness of draftees and then with the 10th Armored Division as a neuropsychiatrist (seeing active combat during the Battle of the Bulge); at war's end, he was called to serve at the Nuremberg trials and then served on the denazification process for the American Military Government, service which lead to the publication of his seminal work Father Land (1948) widely used in University courses and by those setting up anti-nazi democratic systems in Germany. After the war, Bert took further training with the William Alanson White Institute in New York City, with which he was associated for most of his career as a psychiatrist, teaching, advising and leading. During these years he was active in promoting mental health initiatives in the Caribbean, serving on the Expert Committee for Mental Health of the United Nations, advising the British, French and Dutch island governments in the West Indies on their mental health programs, and assisting numerous other international organizations. Never abandoning his private psychiatric practice, he was a leader in the study of the problems of homosexual practitioners in the medical world; he was proud of being one of the very first doctors to treat AIDS patients, writing articles seeking more humane attitudes and treatment for them, and from the 1980's forward, he dedicated much of his professional efforts to helping HIV/AIDS patients and the health care providers who ministered to them, continuing to receive patients at his home office until shortly before his death. Also well known as a collector of Indian art, an interest spurred by his participation in a Brooklyn Museum trip to India in 1966, Dr. Schaffner travelled often to the subcontinent and became a beloved member of the arts community in New York, serving on the Collections Committee of The Brooklyn Museum, to which he was both devoted and one of its major donors. Author, prizewinner, compassionate psychiatrist and a model of what it means to be a friend, Bert is survived by his sister-in-law, Mrs. Robert Edward Schaffner, two nieces, and many cousins in all parts of the country, as well as a host of professional colleagues and close friends from all walks of life. A memorial service will be held at a time subsequently to be announced."

Now it's looking farther afield: beginning Wednesday at 10 p.m., its in-house 101 channel will begin carrying ''UNDERBELLY,'' a fact-based drama about the Australian drug trade that is in its third season on the Nine Network in Australia. That series, winner of both Logie (low-brow) and Australian Film Institute (high-brow) awards for best television drama, has told stories of dealers, police officers and politicians covering the late 1970s to about 2004; DirecTV is beginning with the show's second season, ''A Tale of Two Cities,'' which comes first chronologically. The show has been compared to ''The Sopranos,'' but based on the first few episodes of ''A Tale of Two Cities'' it's more like ''Traffic'' with copious nudity."

2010-01-31T00:00:00Z,"Influential artists sometimes click in the public consciousness only after the rise of the movements they have influenced. A school of creative work emerges -- seemingly spontaneously, its origins obscure at first. Then, with attention to the artists in that school comes recognition of their influences, their antecedents and their mentors. After Pollock, de Kooning and their peers in postwar American art established Abstract Expressionism, the precursory importance of prewar iconoclasts like Kandinsky became clear. After the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and the Clash blurted forth punk rock in the 1970s, a rude vision became apparent in the noise of '60s garage bands like the Seeds. A new movement in jazz has surfaced over the past few years -- a wave of highly expressive music more concerned with emotion than with craft or virtuosity; a genre-blind music that casually mingles strains of pop, classical and folk musics from many cultures; an informal, elastic music unyielding to rigid conceptions of what jazz is supposed to be. It's fair to call it ''post-Marsalis,'' in that it leaves behind the defensive, canon-oriented musical conservatism of '90s jazz (as both Branford and Wynton Marsalis themselves have done in their best work of the past decade). Among this music's most celebrated and duly admired practitioners are the pianists Brad Mehldau, Ethan Iverson (of the trio the Bad Plus), Jason Moran and Vijay Iyer. And singular among the trailblazers of their art, a largely unsung innovator of this borderless, individualistic jazz -- a jazz for the 21st century -- is the pianist and composer Fred Hersch."

2010-01-31T00:00:00Z,"Recently, scientists in Germany gathered several groups of men and women to look at their cells' life spans. Some of them were young and sedentary, others middle-aged and sedentary. Two other groups were, to put it mildly, active. The first of these consisted of professional runners in their 20s, most of them on the national track-and-field team, training about 45 miles per week. The last were serious, middle-aged longtime runners, with an average age of 51 and a typical training regimen of 50 miles per week, putting those young 45-mile-per-week sluggards to shame. From the first, the scientists noted one aspect of their older runners. It ''was striking,'' recalls Dr. Christian Werner, an internal-medicine resident at Saarland University Clinic in Hamburg, ''to see in our study that many of the middle-aged athletes looked much younger than sedentary control subjects of the same age.''"

It seemed an appropriate entrance for my meeting with Joan Collins, a woman known for draping herself in animal prints, and who has in recent years come to be heralded as the ""original cougar."" Try as she might, she cannot escape the association with Alexis Carrington, the perfectly bitchy character she portrayed for almost a decade on the prime time soap opera ""Dynasty."" And on this day, Alexis - oh, sorry - Joan was being photographed for the jewelry designer Alexis Bittar's spring ad campaign. Alexis the legend, donning bold, '80s-inspired costume jewelry designed by another Alexis who, hard to believe, had never seen the show.But I had, and I was about to meet the woman who, as Alexis, devoured anyone who stood between her what she wanted, and did so sporting big hair, red lips and shoulders galore - whether bare or padded. She did it so well that today people have trouble distinguishing her character from the real person who was now seated in front of me, wrapped in her own Michael Kors leopard-print trench coat and clutching a decidedly unglamorous white Styrofoam cup of coffee. ""I would never go out to lunch in a tracksuit,"" she said about her insistence on keeping up appearances. ""But I might pop out to the supermarket in one - but only in L.A."""

When the award was first handed out in 1969 and 1970, it was given to a novel published in the previous year; starting in 1971, the prize was given to a novel published that same year -- meaning that several works published in 1970 were ineligible. The new award, called the Lost Man Booker Prize, will be awarded in May to one of 22 works on a long list that includes Murdoch's ""A Fairly Honorable Defeat""; O'Brian's ""Master and Commander"" and Farrell's ""Troubles,"" as well as Shirley Hazzard's ""The Bay of Noon"" and Brian Aldiss's ""The Hand-Reared Boy.""

The portrait of Mr. Salinger, who died on Wednesday at 91, was created by Robert Vickrey for the cover of Time magazine published on Sept. 15, 1961, and is meant to depict the author against a (metaphorical) amber wave of grain. (In that cover story, which was timed to the publication of Mr. Salinger's story collection ""Franny & Zooey,"" the Time reporter writes that when Mr. Salinger moved to Cornish, N.H., in the early 1950s, ""he was friendly and talkative; now when he jeeps to town, he speaks only the few words necessary to buy food or newspapers."") A press representative for the National Portrait Gallery said the painting was given to the gallery by Time magazine in 1978 and was last on display there through 1979.

The singer Matt Lamkin operates at a single emotional register, sounding disdainful and disaffected at once.

Maybe the drummer breaks away from the song's governing rhythm and does something on the toms; the bassist starts playing agitated repetitions; and Mr. Evans commences some percussive banging or a little sly, perverse repetition or an improvised idea extended beyond the breaking point.

''I only want to be left to my own ways,'' declares Tim Smith, the band's lead singer and songwriter, like a precocious child from behind a closed door.

2010-02-01T00:00:00Z,"JOFFE--Robert D. All the lawyers and staff of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP mourn the loss of their partner Bob Joffe, a friend and mentor who was a preeminent litigator and boardroom adviser. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife and family to whom he was so devoted. Mr. Joffe was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in August 2009 and died in New York, NY on January 28. He was 66 years old. Over the course of his extraordinary career, Mr. Joffe was well- known nationally and internationally, both for his tenacity in handling landmark litigation and for his ability to provide highly sensitive counsel in the boardrooms of corporate America. Since 1978, Mr. Joffe was the primary outside lawyer for Time Warner. One of the many significant matters he handled was the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. He was the principal litigator for Time Inc. in successfully rebutting Paramount's 1989 attempted takeover in a case considered to be a milestone in M&A litigation. Mr. Joffe represented the Boards of Directors of some of the world's most prominent companies in connection with their most pressing challenges, especially during the recent financial crisis. He was a longtime advisor to the non-management directors of Fannie Mae and was also counsel to the independent directors of Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, General Electric and General Motors, among many others. Mr. Joffe was passionate about human rights even as a student at Harvard Law School. From 1967 to 1969, after just a few months as a Cravath associate, Mr. Joffe left New York to serve in the Ministry of Justice of the Government of Malawi on an Africa Asia Public Service Fellowship funded by the Ford Foundation. It was in this position that he assisted the Commissioner for Law Revision in rewriting the country's laws and instituting a framework for supervision of the local courts for this African country. He continued his interest in civil rights and, in 1989, he argued Martin v. Wilks, a pro bono civil rights case in the United States Supreme Court in which he represented black and women municipal employees in Birmingham, Alabama, in an effort to secure equal opportunity in employment. In later years, as Cravath's Presiding Partner, Mr. Joffe was a strong promoter of the need for lawyers to treat pro bono clients with equal regard and concern as they would any paying client. Mr. Joffe became a partner at Cravath in 1975. He was elected Deputy Presiding Partner in 1997 and became Cravath's Presiding Partner in 1999. Mr. Joffe served as the Firm's leader until December 31, 2006. Mr. Joffe was a beloved and devoted husband, father and son. He is survived by his wife Virginia (Dinny), two children, Katherine Joffe (New York, NY) and David Joffe (New York, NY) and two stepchildren, Dr. Ryan DeHaas (Concord, NC) and Elizabeth DeHass (New York, NY), and two grandchildren. He is also survived by his mother, Bertha Joffe, and two brothers, Paul Joffe (Washington, DC) and Richard Joffe (New York, NY). A memorial service will be held to celebrate his life on Wednesday, February 10th at 11am at All Souls Church, 1157 Lexington Ave. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Human Rights First, 333 Seventh Ave., 13th Floor, New York, NY 10001 or to The After-School Corporation, 1440 Broadway, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10018."
2010-02-01T00:00:00Z,"PAASWELL BAILINSON--Jean, passed away on January 31, at home in New York after a brief illness. Born May 7, 1924 in Brooklyn, to Benjamin and Lucille Paaswell, Jean was a lifelong and loyal New Yorker, lover of the Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Mets and the Metropolitan Opera. She studied at the Pratt Institute and Traphagen School of Fashion and began her career at Lord & Taylor's, then worked briefly at the New York Times where she met her former husband, Frank Bailinson, a long-time editor. Her advertising career focused on the fashion industry through the creation of Jean Paaswell Associates. In 1973 she founded Jean Grayson's Brownstone Studio, a successful mail order women's apparel company, serving as its President and chief creative force for almost thirty years. Jean will be remembered as a dynamic self-taught business-person with a wonderful fashion sense and an ability to treat everyone with compassion and dignity. Jean's first priority was her family for whom she was a devoted and self-less mother, grandmother and recently great-grandmother. She is survived by daughter Ann Kleinman of New York, son Frank Bailinson (Jann Dickerson) of San Francisco, son James Bailinson (Nancy Gibson) of Cumberland, Maine, and grandchildren Jill Kleinman Halberg (Kenneth) of New York, Emily, Charlotte, Peter and Julia Bailinson and great grandchild Zoe Lucille Halberg.

The series, which runs through Feb. 4 has been ""examining virtually every aspect of the guitar's musical personality"" since 1999. Tonight, head to <a href=""http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/artist/207"">Le Poisson Rouge</a> to listen to <b>Marc Ribot</b>'s contribution. ""Mr. Ribot is a fount of pithy commentary,"" writes Nate Chinen. ""In Ceramic Dog, his punkish band with the bass guitarist Shahzad Ismaily and the drummer Ches Smith, he pursues a more messily ecstatic agenda; the name of the group's most recent album, 'Party Intellectuals,' captures it perfectly."" Mr. Ribot will be performing songs off that album as part of the festival with Skeleton$. "
2010-02-02T00:00:00Z,"The goal of the European artist<b> Tino Sehgal</b> is to create “something (a situation) from virtually nothing (actions, words) and then let that something disappear, leaving no potentially marketable physical trace,” <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/01/arts/design/01tino.html?8ur&emc=ur"">writes Holland Cotter</a>. “His rule may be unenforceable in this day and age. Still, it turns the museum into a zone of sort-of secrecy. It piques both the voyeur and the skeptic in us.” Mr. Sehgal, who lives in Berlin and studied political economy and dance, has cleared out the <b>Guggenheim</b> for his self-titled exhibition, which runs through March 10. “Yet the space isn’t empty. On the rotunda’s ground floor, a man and woman entwine in a changing, slow-motion amorous embrace” and “on the ramps above, people walk and talk in pairs or clusters at a leisurely pace, with new participants periodically joining conversations as others drop away.” Mr. Sehgal’s art is made up almost entirely of such balletic tableaus and social encounters; it’s bare-bones but “addictive” and makes you want to return for more.

The painting of Mr. Salinger, above, who died on Wednesday at 91, was created by Robert Vickrey for the cover of Time magazine published on Sept. 15, 1961, and is meant to depict the reclusive Mr. Salinger against a (metaphorical) amber wave of grain. (In that cover story, timed to the publication of Mr. Salinger’s story collection “Franny & Zooey,” the Time reporter writes that when Mr. Salinger moved to Cornish, N.H., in the early 1950s, “he was friendly and talkative; now when he jeeps to town, he speaks only the few words necessary to buy food or newspapers.”) A press representative for the National Portrait Gallery said Time gave the painting to the gallery in 1978, and the work was last on display there through 1979."

Salinger, but The Cleveland Plain Dealer has landed what is believed to be the first interview in nearly 20 years with Bill Watterson, the privacy-loving creator of the comic strip ''Calvin and Hobbes.'' Mr. Watterson's newspaper cartoons about a headstrong boy named Calvin and his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, ran in syndication from 1985 to 1995, until Mr. Watterson stepped away from the strip at the peak of its popularity, and he has rarely spoken about it since. Asked 15 years later why ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was such a popular work, Mr. Watterson told The Plain Dealer: ''I just tried to write honestly, and I tried to make this little world fun to look at, so people would take the time to read it. That was the full extent of my concern.'' Mr. Watterson added that he still experienced ''occasional flare-ups of weirdness'' from die-hard fans and was flattered that people still read his work, but, he said, ''I wrote 'Calvin and Hobbes' in my 30s, and I'm many miles from there.''"

The poll numbers seem to confirm others cited by sponsors of the current medical marijuana bill in the Assembly. The poll, on a range of issues before the State Legislature, also found that 75 percent of New York voters support a wage freeze for state workers to help balance the budget, while 78 percent oppose cutting state aid to schools to do so. Gov. David A. Paterson's proposed tax on sugary sodas, meanwhile, was opposed by 57 percent of voters."

2010-02-04T16:05:22Z,"As a New Yorker born in the middle of the 20th century, I come from a place and time where lasagna was without fail made of dried pasta layered with red meat sauce and ricotta, along with the inevitable mozzarella and parmesan. It wasn't until I first visited Italy, in my 20s, that I encountered lasagne (note the shift from ""lasagna"" in the singular, describing the whole dish in Little Italy fashion, to ""lasagne"" in the plural, referring to the sheets of pasta that are its defining ingredient) based on egg pasta, ragù bolognese and béchamel sauce. It seemed very sissified at the time, but somehow it came to be my standard, perhaps simply because it is a more satisfactory dish. I still occasionally make ricotta/red sauce lasagna, but most of the time the lasagne that come out of our oven are more in a Bolognese than a Calabrian vein."

Neil Pepe, the artistic director of the Atlantic Theater Company, is to direct; Mr. Mamet is a founder of the company. The play, about the evolving relationship between a young actor and his older mentor, was first performed in 1977 at the Goodman Theater in Chicago in a production that starred Mike Nussbaum and Joe Mantegna and was directed by Gregory Mosher. That same year it played off Broadway at the Lucille Lortel Theater, where it starred Peter Evans and Ellis Rabb and was directed by Gerald Gutierrez.

2010-02-04T13:42:40Z,"When Chicago-born Harry Gordon Selfridge opened Selfridge's department store in London in 1909, he wasn't thinking small - the original architect drawings show the Oxford Street shop topped with a dome that rivals that of St. Paul's. (It was nixed before construction began, but a colonnade of impressive looking Doric columns adorns the building's facade). A pioneer of the shopping-as-entertainment school of retailing, Selfridge was all in favor of using culture to get shoppers through his doors. So while the latest exhibit to go up in the store's gallery space, the Museum of Small Things (MOST), may sound like, well, small potatoes, he would no doubt have approved. Conceived of in collaboration with the artist and designer Kit Grover and POCKO, MOST celebrates the tiny and the trifling. ""We left the definition of small up to the artists,"" Grover says. ""So it can mean something minuscule or something that's generally ignored or thought of as insignificant."" The exhibit is arranged in the form of a labyrinth, with a rotating eight-foot head created by the Japanese artist Kin Pro at the center. ""Kind of like a Macy's float, but not from this planet,"" Grover says. ""We wanted to play with scale. You can't see all of it as you approach it, so you feel like you're being peered in on by someone very large - and you're miniature."" Also included in MOST are a bag by Grayson Perry (limited-edition replicas are available at the exhibit pop-up shop), a Richard Wentworth dictionary (""of small, of course"") and several films, including ""I Met the Walrus,"" which features a soundtrack of an interview a teenage fan did with John Lennon in the 1960s paired with animation by James Braithwaite."

""Paris, Texas"" (1984) isn't just an epic drama that won the Palm d'Or at Cannes; nowadays it feels curiously in step with the current culture's ongoing American heritage trip. Shot largely in the Southwest, the film is a paean to America the Authentic: ghost towns, cuffed jeans, the highway, the mustache, the desert landscape, Marlboros, leather boots, chamois shirts, motels, Super-8 home movies, railroad tracks. How convenient then that the Criterion Collection has just remastered the film under the supervision of its director, Wim Wenders, and packaged it stylishly for DVD and Blu-ray. The film, written by Sam Shepard, comes across like a sumptuous coffee-table book inhabited by Harry Dean Stanton, Dean Stockwell and Nastassja Kinski, haunted by the melancholy vibrato of Ry Cooder's slide guitar. As the writer Nick Roddick laments in the accompanying essay, ""The world to which Wenders pays homage is vanishing fast"" - cellphones have replaced photogenic phone booths, McDonald's franchises have gobbled up roadside diners. No amount of limited-edition Red Wings can turn back that tide, as watching the film makes ravishingly and heartbreakingly clear.""Paris, Texas,"" DVD or Blu-ray ($31.96), available at Criterion.com."

""From the moment you enter the galleries you're seeing things you won't find anywhere else and certainly not in this combination: a bronze drum as hefty as a hot tub; a wooden Buddha, tall, dark, and Giacometti-thin. Avid-eyed Hindu deities keep company with contortionist dancers. A tiny serpent of beaten gold basks in a spotlight. Ceramic plates and bowls crowd a room just as they had once filled the hold of a ship that went down in the South China Sea."" As a trade hub, Vietnam absorbed cultural influences from China, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and more, and these disparate influences are reflected in the show. ""Once you've made your way through the society's suave installation, you've seen treasures from 10 Vietnamese museums. You've time-traveled from the first millennium B.C. to the 17th century A.D. And you've style-traveled through dozens of cultures both inside and outside Vietnam itself."""

Vick has been linked repeatedly to the Rams because General Manager Billy Devaney knew Vick while he was with the Falcons and because the Rams' quarterback situation is tenuous at best. Vick has another year on his contract with Philadelphia, but he was used on a limited basis, leading to speculation that the Eagles might try to trade him or even cut him. ''I've got a lot of respect for Michael as a player,'' Spagnuolo said. ''Everything I have heard out of Philadelphia is kind of good. We haven't gone down that road in our process yet.''"

He was not the only one to invoke the stigma of an upper-case A. In point of fact, the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would assign a bright-blue letter ''A'' or a green B to New York restaurants that have passed inspection, instead of handing out a numerical grade as is done now. But still, many in the restaurant business objected as if the city had likened them to Hester Prynne at a public shaming."

And then there has been the long-running saga about whether or not to recall Michael Owen for the World Cup in South Africa.

2010-02-07T00:00:00Z,"Peter Olenick, a 25-year-old freestyle skier and three-time medalist in the halfpipe at the Winter X Games, vividly recalls the first time he tried the Whiskey Flip, his self-invented marquee trick, a twisty, somersaulting double flip executed 20 feet or so above the halfpipe's lip. ''It was terrifying,'' he says. ''I didn't even know if it could be done. But I'd been doing it over and over in my head, so I figured I could make it go right.'' Some deep breaths, some mental finger-crossing and ''I just kind of hucked it,'' he says, landing cleanly, exhilarated. A second attempt was even ''scarier. Now my body knew what was happening. But I did it. Fear kind of keeps all of us going.'' Fear may be the signature emotion of the Winter Olympics, prickling the skin hairs and sharpening the senses of all those athletes moving fast over slick, unforgiving surfaces. ''Everybody feels fear out there, and I mean everybody,'' says Ross Hindman, the founder and program director of the International Snowboard Training Centers in Colorado and California, which specialize in training midlevel and elite snowboarders. Fear affects those of us too who recreationally strap on skis, snowboards, skates or, more rarely, a skin suit in advance of a bobsled run. ''The issue is how you deal with fear,'' Hindman says."

And it was no easy feat. ''I spent two months drawing them,'' he said. ''I had to figure out how to make a flat image glow, like a fish.'' Difficult as it was, the experience inspired Mr. Cardenas's latest work: a series of gouache and watercolors, now on view at the James Fuentes gallery in Chinatown.

I have just really gotten into yoga in the last six months, practicing with teachers twice a week and then with DVDs/podcasts/etc. at home. I love it and would really like to take my practice to the next level, but I'm not sure how. Taking more classes is an obvious option, but I want to get more out of them -- learn the proper names, really understand the poses, the anatomy of it. Are the 200-hour teacher training classes just for people interested in teaching yoga? EP"

2010-02-07T00:00:00Z,"IT'S easy to recognize the Bad Girl. She's usually a bottle blonde, stuffed into a tight sweater that outlines her oddly conical breasts. Her mouth is wide, painted and clamped on a cigarette. Her eyes burn a little too brightly, and her legs, planted in a pair of high-rise pumps, go on forever. This exotic specimen began appearing in American movies around 1944, when one of her first interpreters was Barbara Stanwyck in Billy Wilder's ''Double Indemnity,'' from the James M. Cain novel. An American variation on the femme fatale of the 19th-century romantics, she was not the figure of mystery and dark allure that her European predecessors were, but a more carnal, blatantly sexual and self-interested creature. She was more fond of chewing gum than smoking opium, less concerned with luring men to their metaphysical doom than cleaning out their bank accounts and moving on to the next sucker."

This is where their action is: where the figure skaters make their turns, the skiers and snowboarders perform their tricks. This is where their events are won. But these bursts of competition are also moments of artful levitation and, especially for spectators, of transcendence. Who better to capture such moments than Ryan McGinley, an artist whose photography so often catches bodies in motion? For this portfolio, he visited rinks and mountains in California, Utah, Colorado, New Hampshireand New Jersey in order to choreograph the lightness of being an Olympian. The ice and the snow became his stages, and a dozen of the UnitedStates' greatest winter athletes his players, most of them individually costumed by Kate and Laura Mulleavy, who design clothing for their hipL.A. label, Rodarte.

To illustrate his point, he posted a pic of a young Johnny Hallyday, sprawled on his side like a Calvin Klein model, the collar of his denim jacket popped and the cuffs of his blue jeans rolled. Maybe it has to do with the economy, but that down-home country cool still has appeal -- and, as is visible on the streets and the spring runways, it's having a moment. Witness the February cover of Vogue, which features Jessica Biel in a three-piece denim ensemble from Ralph Lauren. Like a handful of labels this season, including D & G and Mulberry, Mr. Lauren was looking to communicate a more rugged sense of chic, one exemplified by the jewelry designer Gaia Repossi (bottom left), who showed up at Valentino's recent couture show after-party in an outfit right off the ranch."

How has life treated them? In 1955 Anna Sokolow, a choreographer with a strong social conscience who must often have mulled over such matters, put her wonderings onstage in ''Rooms.'' She created a portrait gallery of city dwellers -- most of them lonely or unhappy -- in a shabby apartment house, and she theatrically symbolized their rooms with arrangements of chairs. Sokolow, who died in 2000, would have been 100 years old this year, and the LIMÓN DANCE COMPANY is honoring her with a revival of ''Rooms,'' with its searing jazz score by Kenyon Hopkins played live by performers from the Manhattan School of Music jazz department, conducted by Justin DiCioccio. The Limón company's program also includes one of José Limón's best-known works of the '50s, ''There Is a Time'' (1956), a dance interpretation of the passage from Ecclesiastes that in the English Standard Version begins, ''For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die'' and ''a time for war, and a time for peace.''

I've narrowed it down to five cities in Spain: Barcelona, Valencia, Alicante, Seville and Granada. All the programs are relatively similar, so at this point I'm trying to make the decision based on weather, culture and how easy it is to travel to other countries. My Spanish is fairly good, but I am concerned that the Catalan in Barcelona might be a problem.

2010-02-07T00:00:00Z,"Film Two recent, smart French films -- ''Angel of Mine'' and ''The Joy of Singing'' -- can be seen on IFC Films video-on-demand service. ''ANGEL OF MINE,'' directed by Safy Nebbou, stars Catherine Frot as Elsa, an emotionally unstable woman in the midst of a divorce who spots a pretty little girl at a birthday party attended by her son and is convinced that the girl is her daughter, who died in a hospital fire days after her birth. Elsa stalks the girl's mother, Claire (Sandrine Bonnaire), by posing as a prospective buyer for the house of the family, which is moving to Canada. There is an inevitable showdown. The beautifully acted film suggests a sophisticated descendant of ''The Great Lie,'' the 1941 weepie starring Bette Davis and Mary Astor."

2010-02-07T00:00:00Z,"CREATED in New York more than 80 years ago by Irving Schott and named after his favorite Cuban cigar, the Perfecto motorcycle jacket is an American classic, sported by every stylish rebel since Marlon Brando and duplicated by just as many designers. Now, finally, comes the women's Perfecto -- a streamlined lambskin version made, by hand, on the same turn-of-the-century machines as the men's, and worn rather superbly by Blake Lively on the cover of the February Esquire. No surprise, the jacket has generated considerable excitement among the fashion masses -- if not for its authenticity, then for its affordability: at $386, it is a steal compared with, say, Balenciaga's much-coveted $2,600 biker jacket. But then, as Jason Schott, the company's C.O.O. and Irving's great-grandson, put it, ''Not everything made in the U.S.A. has to carry a luxury price tag.''"

2010-02-07T00:00:00Z,"Stay Balanced The Saints are thought of as a pass-happy team, but they are more likely to run (240 plays) than pass (233) on first down. That first-down balance keeps teams from blitzing or using nickel packages on early downs. It also allows Drew Brees to use play-action to surprise defenses when he does pass: Brees has thrown 29 passes of 20 or more yards on first down, and the play-action bomb is one of his favorite plays. The Saints average 4.6 yards per carry on first-and-10, so when they do run they will have success against the undersized Colts defense. A solid running game and an unpredictable offense will keep the Colts from sitting back in two-deep zones and waiting for Brees to darken the skies with footballs."

2010-02-07T00:00:00Z,"Theater If William Shakespeare did return Sir John Falstaff to life on the orders of the queen, as the legend about the origins of ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' goes, what does that say about the playwright? The idea that Shakespeare would do such a thing usually draws knowing chuckles from college professors, but since it's been more than four centuries now, and the guy's reputation is pretty secure, can't we say that ''Merry Wives'' may have been something of a sellout? If Harry S. Truman asked Arthur Miller to bring back that wonderful Willy Loman in the early 1950s, I'd like to think that Miller would have balked. Bill Cain's speculative historical drama, ''Equivocation,'' imagines the thought process of a Shakespeare-like character under pressure from the state. That character, named Shag and played by John Pankow, is ordered by King James to write a friendly drama about the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 that fabricates history to serve the purposes of the government. Filled with historical digressions, literary in-jokes and plays within plays (expect scenes from ''Macbeth'' and ''King Lear''), the ambitious comic play, which has received stellar reviews in regional productions, presents a pragmatic artist struggling with his conscience, among other considerations. The great Garry Hynes (''The Beauty Queen of Leenane'') directs. Starts previews on Tuesday, Manhattan Theater Club at City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, mtc-nyc.org; $75."

Born in the Bronx, New York on April 29, 1917, he was the son of Belgian emigres Albert and Mary DeSmedt. In 1940 he married Eleanor Schneier and soon thereafter went into service for his country as a navigator in the Army Air Force. On December 30th, 1943 their B-24 nicknamed ""Sad Sack"" was shot down by German fighter planes on the outskirts of Paris. Ted would spend the remainder of the war as a POW in Luftstalag One on the Baltic Sea. Released by the advancing Russian Army he came home and resumed his work with the United States Shipping Lines in the scheduling department. Ted then moved to the Isbrandsten Company and over the years held a number of positions eventually becoming President of the merged American Export Isbrandsten Lines. His career would take him to chief executive positions in the shipping world at States Marine Isthmian, Prudential Grace, Marchessini and Reefer Express Lines. Ted was invited to participate in the renowned Harvard Amp Business School in 1969 along with other corporate executives. He was elected class President. Outside of work, Ted found time to enjoy many other activities. He loved the opera and became the first corporate sponsor of The Metropolitan Opera House. A member of the Downtown Athletic Club, he swam for an hour each day prior to going to the office. He was an Elder in the Upper Saddle River Dutch Reformed Church. He traveled internationally on business and had friends and associates throughout the world. He was equally comfortable in the company of princes, ministers, business executives and longshoremen. In 1982 Ted retired and started a ship chartering and brokerage firm, Shipping Services Company, Inc. in San Mateo, California. Eleanor, his beloved wife of 48 years, passed away in 1988. In 1990 he married Nancy Conway Holland of San Mateo. She was his loving companion for the remainder of his life. His friends and family will always remember him for his calm demeanor and his sage advice. There never was a problem so large or so small that he couldn't help you to work through it. His wisdom will be missed by everyone who had the good fortune to know him as a father, friend, or mentor.

2010-02-07T00:00:00Z,"Sustain Drives The Colts gain an average of 36.8 yards per offensive drive, the second-highest figure in the N.F.L. (the Patriots led the league). The Saints defense is designed to force turnovers, not three-and-outs, so opponents can move the ball on them. Saints opponents gained an average of 31 yards per drive, 22nd in the league. The Colts' 12-play drives do more than put points on the board: they keep the opposing offense off the field, and they put opponents in bad field position when the Colts are forced to punt. Ball control is crucial against the Saints offense. Their quick-strike offense can turn a close game into a blowout if given too many opportunities."

At 24, Smith reached the feat more quickly than any player has reached 900, but he has done it with a relatively slow and steady approach, never recording more than 227 blocks in a season or averaging more than 2.9 blocks a game. The single-season N.B.A. record for blocks is 456 by Mark Eaton in 1984-85, when he averaged 5.56 a game."

2010-02-08T10:31:57Z,"Vampires are so last decade - these days, it's all about monsters. At the center of this scary trend is Lady Gaga, whose stage performances feature ""Thriller""-style choreography and ghoulish costume changes. (Even Filipino prisoners helped push the trend with their famous YouTube video.) Alexander McQueen, who has cited Lady Gaga as an influence, recently showed an otherworldly collection accented with prosthetic makeup and podlike 10-inch reptilian platforms. Gareth Pugh also unleashed a legion of threatening, heavily powdered models in a broodingly romantic zombie romp, and Lanvin's disturbing new ad campaign stars the photographers Vinoodh Matadin and Inez van Lamsweerde - the latter in full-body makeup that makes her look as if she's been skinned alive.Perhaps the house should consider a partnership with the jewelry designer Emily Miranda, whose chunky pieces feature flesh-ripping animal claws. The film world is also right on trend. Spike Jonze got things going with ""Where the Wild Things Are,"" which was followed by remakes of ""The Wolfman"" and, in theaters soon, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" Natalie Portman has signed on for ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,"" and Tim Burton's dark directorial oeuvre is being celebrated in a career retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art through April 26.

Like big farmers, the major signature-gathering companies can determine what measures they want to plant on the statewide ballot - and what they do not. Kimball Petition Management does not want anyone to plant initiatives promoting a constitutional convention. Fred Kimball, who runs the petition firm, said he opposed such ballot initiatives and said he had warned independent managers that he would blacklist them if they work with Repair California, the Bay Area group promoting constitutional reform. One issue: the state constitutional convention, if it materializes, might remake the ballot initiative process. John Grubb, a spokesman for Repair California, said signature-gathering firms had blacklisted their petitions and shouted at their volunteers. Repair California has sent cease-and-desist letters to the major signature gathering firms. In the meantime, while those gathering signatures to put measures on the ballot usually carry multiple proposed propositions, some will not carry those two initiatives.

The character Seymour Glass commits suicide while on vacation with his wife, not while on his honeymoon. (The error also appeared in a news article on Aug. 31, 2000; a book review on Oct. 8, 2000; and in essays on March 23 and Dec. 31, 2008.) The obituary also misstated the name of the yearbook at Valley Forge Military Academy in Pennsylvania, for which Mr. Salinger was literary editor when he was a student there; it was Crossed Sabres, not Crossed Swords. And the obituary referred incorrectly to a work he had written while at Valley Forge. It was a poem that was later set to music; it was not a school song."

Last week, The Independent said, the festival's technical chief, Klaus Kretschmer, was found unconscious under a bridge in Salzburg, and is believed to have attempted suicide after being accused of charging the festival for non-existent services. Over all, the festival may have been defrauded of as much as $2.75 million.

2010-02-09T11:29:06Z,"Rita Konig is a decorator based in New York who has written about style for British Vogue, The Telegraph and Domino.I find that one of the keys to giving a living room a feeling of depth and substance is to have something -- like a piece of furniture -- visible behind the sofa or chairs. It leads your eye into the distance, giving the room that third dimension it so often lacks. I spent last Friday with a client, moving furniture around. The newly upholstered furniture was arriving in her living room, the first phase in the transformation of a room that has been long-unused into one that can be enjoyed on a daily basis. Behind the new pair of club chairs, we put a chest of drawers between two windows. The room immediately felt substantial in a way it hadn't before, as well as very cozy and warm. (This is also an excellent way to use a piece of furniture that your parents gave you, and which has sentimental value but which is not necessarily to your own taste. Not every piece in a room needs to be your absolute favorite thing; in fact, it is usually preferable for at least one thing not to be.)When chairs or sofas just sit in front of a wall, the space behind them can look rather sad. At home, I have been struggling with the depressing nest of cables and air of general neglect behind my club chair. But what was putting a monkey wrench in the decorating works was that I didn't need a table there -- there is already a desk nearby -- so I left it until finally it came to me. What I wanted, I realized as I put the last of a small stack of logs on the fire, was a really big log basket. I love log baskets, and it has been something I have wanted for a long time. They look so good in rooms, and, in the same way that bookcases and drinks trays do, they imply civilized living is going on!"

O.K., here goes: It might be time to cut off my hair.Every man I have consulted on the issue believes it is a bad idea. And the experts seem to agree that there are historical and biological links between long hair and sexual desirability. (But what are these guys thinking? That we'll go on a date? I'm married.) On the other hand, every mother I talk to has either cut her hair or wishes she was brave enough to do so. Iconic images of mothers principally show women with their hair up, or short. Dorothea Lange's ""Migrant Mother"" had seven children and hair - from what we can tell in the photographs - no longer than her shoulders.

2010-02-09T00:00:00Z,"PALEY--Cabot Barber, died peacefully on February 5th. The cause of death was a stroke. Cabot was born on June 14th 1925 in Elizabeth, NJ and grew up in Cranford, NJ. Her parents, Henry Oberly Barber and Sophie Cabot Brewster Barber had three other children: an older brother Ken, an older sister Anne and a younger sister Sophie. After graduating from Cranford High School, Cabot attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, where she met the love of her life, Henry David Paley. They were married on April 23, 1946. Over the next decade Cab and Hank moved their growing family from Ohio to California, to South Carolina, New Jersey, Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia. During these years they had five children: Brewster, Deborah, Andrew, Jonathan and Sarah. In addition to raising her children, she worked alongside Hank, unionizing migrant farm and paper mill workers. In '57, Hank's union job moved from Washington to Albany, NY, and he and Cabot moved their family just north of there to the small town of Crescent, on the Mohawk River. Cabot went back to school at Russell Sage College in Troy, where she got her BA. She had a keen interest in government and politics and had been an active member of the League of Women Voters while living in Virginia. When New York State was gearing up to hold a constitutional convention in '64, Cabot ran her own campaign to serve as a delegate. Cabot taught at Shenendehowa Elementary School in Clifton Park, NY until 1967, when the family moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn. In Brooklyn she became one of the pioneer teachers at High School Redirection, in one of the toughest neighborhoods in the borough. She then attended Hunter College School of Social Work, earned a Masters in Clinical Social Work and became a therapist. In the mid 1970s Cabot and Hank moved back upstate, to Catskill. Cabot had a private practice in Catskill and also saw patients in Albany. Hank, then the president of the Commission for Independent Colleges and Universities, died suddenly on April 16, 1984 at the age of 59. In 1990 Cabot married Donald Thaler of Amagansett, NY where they lived together until 2007, when Cabot moved to Portland, ME. In addition to her five children and second husband, Cabot is survived by two stepchildren, Peter and Cathy Thaler and 12 grandchildren, Nicole, Stephanie, Zack, Violet, Sophie, Henry, Hanna, Logan, Arlyn, Eden, Mathew and David. She will be missed by her friends and family who cherished her unique sense of humor and great sense of adventure.

""Neelie"" is survived by her beloved grandchildren, Dylan, Cameron, Hayden (Breier) and Jake Henderson, her adoring husband of 44 years, Robert Breier, her mother, her cherished children Ben Breier and Lylle Breier Henderson, her deeply loved daughter-in-law and son-in-law, Shelly Breier and Cmdr Andrew Henderson, and her brother Jerald Gruebel. A ""triple"" Graduate of the University of Miami, she received degrees in Education (B.S.), Library Sciences (M.S.) and Law (J.D.). Eileen taught elementary school, was an innovative high school librarian, and lawyer, having clerked for the legendary Judge Wilke D. Ferguson. It is often said of our departed loved ones that they loved life; but Eileen truly adored it. She cherished every day, living with a contagious joy in her heart that touched everyone she met. Fiercely devoted to her family and hopelessly enthralled with her four grandchildren, she was the real glue that bound her growing family together from coast-to-coast and parts in between. A loving wife, a devoted mother, and an adoring grandma, Eileen who loved words and books and poetry -- went by the palindrome ""Neelie"" with her grandkids. She never let a family event go by without extensive photography to memorialize every cherished moment, and she even had an external computer drive dedicated to her beloved photos and scanned mementos literally thousands upon thousands. Each snapshot was a treasured moment in time with her family and friends, which she then transformed into volume upon volume of photo albums. Five-foot two (including heels and hair) Eileen was a giant! She had scores of friends at each of the two California and Florida homes between which she split time. From bridge games to book clubs, walking groups to wine drinkers, her many friends were as diverse as they were dear to her. She celebrated every joyous occasion, she consoled every loss and she never missed a holiday. Eileen loved people and people loved Eileen. Her laughter permeated the air, and her smile lit up the room. Our pain in losing her is so great that we hesitate at times, wondering how we are going to get by without her guidance, mentorship, advice, love and unbreakable spirit. But we also know how much she detested wallowing, and how spitting mad she'd be if we didn't press on. So we will care for her friends, support her dear causes, take those family photos, and smother our children with love. Because our Neelie wouldn't have it any other way. The world is a better place for her having passed through it. Eileen's memorial service will take place on Tuesday, February 9 at 10am, at Riverside Gordon Memorial Chapel, 1920 Alton Road, Miami Beach. (305)531-1151. The burial will follow the service at Mt. Nebo Kendall Cemetery, 5900 S.W. 77 Ave., Miami, FL. (305)274-0641.

2010-02-10T18:00:34Z,"Starting tomorrow, Resurrection's ""20 Years of Maison Martin Margiela: The Marcia Berger Collection"" will be on view at One Jackson Square in downtown Manhattan. The more than 1,000 mint-condition accessories and garments will then go up for auction, in a collaboration between the vintage clothing resource and 1stdibs. There has been a fair amount said about Berger's collection, which includes some 40 one-of-a-kind artisanal pieces, like a top made from vintage opera gloves, a dress-form top and a sweater made from military socks; the collection spans the designer's career from 1989 up until the time he was rumored to be phoning his work in from Ibiza, Spain. But just who is the woman who assembled - and never wore! - this Margiela trove? A quick search yields little on Berger, who is occasionally described as a ""fashion doyenne."" This is a fair enough assumption for someone who in her lifetime (she died in 2008) amassed enough high-end and avant-garde clothing to fuel multiple sales. (Resurrection already sold off her stash of shoes - Alaia, Yohji, Louboutin, Manolo Blahnik, etc. - in 2008. She was a size 8/8.5 in case you were wondering.) Yet, to hear Resurrection's Mark Haddawy describe her, she was anything but doyenne-ish. Quite the opposite in fact. Like most L.A. women, Berger was typically dressed-down and favored a uniform of jeans, a Margiela AIDS T-shirt and flip-flops. She drove a Ford Taurus. Unlike the python-clad L.A. fashion cowboy Jim Goldstein, Berger was not a front-row fixture on the show circuit. Yet, no doubt when she walked into stores like Laura Urbinati or Maxfield or Mameg, her salespeople's eyes would light up. ""It's an amazing collection put together in real time,"" says Haddawy, who with Katy Rodriguez was responsible for organizing and cataloging the contents of Berger's closets. To the untrained eye, he adds, many of the pieces looked like they should have been tossed in the trash. ""They were ripped, burned, wrinkled or otherwise damaged."" Intentionally of course."

The “perfect neighborhood trattoria” on the corner of <b>Gramercy Park</b> would “sit atop of the heap in many other cities,” but, thanks to the surplus of great restaurants here, “goes unnoticed in New York,” -- that is, until now. The chef <b>Marco Fregonese</b>, who has been at the helm of Novitá since it opened in 1994, has been steadily improving it since then, and his new, simpler approach is worth noting. Go for the pastas, which are “just ridiculous: perfectly prepared, full of flavor, a rejoinder to low expectations.” Try “a plate of gramigna alla carbonara,  for instance, thin strands of curled pasta with eggs, pecorino romano, guanciale and black pepper.” It “arrives on the table as a riot of simplicity, a four-member noise band. It is outstanding, firm and pliant, salty and sweet, slick and sticky and rich.” The  “breaded baby eggplant baked with tomato, mozzarella and Parmesan is like something out of a Bensonhurst fever dream.” Bring an appetite: “You won’t go away hungry from Novitá; the plates are food, not art.” "

After her husband's three year tour in the U.S. Army in Frankfurt, Germany, the family, now with two young daughters, returned to New York City, where a third daughter was born. In 1979, the family purchased property on Block Island, RI, and Mary became proprietress of the Sea Breeze Inn. Over the years she became an active leader of the community, founding several environmental organizations and ultimately becoming a leading member of the town's Planning Board. A lifelong supporter of the arts, she also was the Founder of the Island Gallery. Mary was an accomplished painter throughout her life. Her devotion to the arts included architecture, ceramics and dance. Following a gallant battle for six months, she succumbed finally to her illness. Her ashes will be scattered onto the ocean that she loved so much. She is survived by her loving husband of 52 years. Her siblings Arthur Taylor, Patricia Keany, and Jayne Taraski.

A noted economist, Carl taught at Harvard University and, since 1976, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was the David W. Skinner Professor of Political Economy and directed the Program in Science, Technology, and Society. As Deputy Special Assistant for National Security Affairs under President John F. Kennedy, he oversaw foreign economic policy and advised on national security and disarmament issues. Among the most trusted members of Kennedy's inner circle, he helped to shape the U.S. responses to crises in Berlin and Congo. During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis he was known as ""the Vice President in charge of the rest of the world,"" and in 1963 he participated in U.S.-Soviet negotiations that resulted in the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. He brought his breadth of experience, as well as his characteristic wisdom and calm, to his work with CISS, through which he continued actively to address challenges to global peace and security. Most recently, he helped to shape the Academy's international projects on the Global Nuclear Future and on Cybersecurity. He authored or edited numerous Academy publications, including major Academy studies on topics ranging the war in Iraq to corporate governance.

That question is swirling around Canada today, and the most frequent answer is Wayne Gretzky, although the Great One himself is not answering.Gretzky would be the default choice, a figure admired by all Canadians and in many countries around the world, most notably Russia and the United States. But it somehow doesn't seem surprising enough. Could it be Gretzky and Gordie Howe, who met him when Gretzky was a small boy and was a present, guardian angel-like, at all the key points in his career? Or could it be Gretzky and a woman, perhaps Canada's greatest female player, Hayley Wickenheiser, even if she will be playing these Games as well?Clues are offered by some of the torchbearers on Thursday and Friday. The beloved Vancouver Canucks of yesteryear, Richard Brodeur and Stan Smyl are among them, as well as iconic players for the British Columbia Lions and Vancouver Whitecaps. So is Rolly Fox, father of Terry Fox, who enthralled the nation by almost making it all the way across Canada in a cancer benefit run before succumbing to the disease. Walter Gretzky, the country's iconic hockey dad, will carry the flame - an especially poignant torchbearer, in that a 1991 brain aneurysm left him without 20 years of memory, including that of his son's incredible early hockey successes, until intensive therapy enabled him to recover."

I knew that I could always rely on Richard and I think he knew that I would always be there for him. I thought of him as indestructible. His strong personality was coupled with great intellect and an unusually good sense of humor. He was a caring, feeling and humane person, which is a rare combination. There are so many good qualities that I think about. I guess his devotion to his family and friends stands out most. I only hope that you and the children can use these wonderful memories to sustain you. This is a loss that leaves a great void in so many lives. All of our love and grief at this time, Cookie and Buzzy Hoffner"

To paraphrase the words of the prophet Elisha, Dr. Lander was the consummate father both to his family and to his people. Imbued with a love of Torah he was single-minded in his commitment to spread its learning and values to the entire Jewish people. Those values also compelled him to be a champion for the civil rights and education of all peoples. Born on the lower east side of Manhattan 94 years ago to David and Goldie Lander he rose to become a pulpit rabbi, a professor of sociology at Hunter College, Dean of Yeshiva University's Bernard Revel Graduate School, advisor to Presidents of the United States, and in 1971 - the founder and President of Touro College. As our President for almost forty years, the college grew from a handful of students to an institution of higher education serving over 17,000 students throughout the world. His vision, which at all times informed the mission of the College, was to enhance Judaism and strengthen the Jewish people as well as to serve humanity. He not only recognized but made a reality the holy obligation to serve society's needs as a whole while promoting the welfare of his people. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his brother Nathan, his son Rabbi Daniel Lander, Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva Ohr Ha Chaim, Ester Greenfield, Debbie Waxman and Hana Lander, and to his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

If there is an answer to Mr. McQueen's death -  and no doubt there will be some thoughtful attempts at an explanation in the coming weeks - it will have to begin with his work. Looking at photographs of some of his great shows - the dance marathon show, the glass box and ""Girl in the Tree"" shows and of course last season's spectacular Web presentation - I think the keys are all there. It's one thing to have the vision and technical ability to realize those kinds of expressions; it is a more difficult burden to also constantly live with the emotions and ideas that those expressions embrace. And Mr. McQueen didn't just have three or four exceptional shows in his career; he had a steady run of them, and the last few seasons really saw him reaching further."

He served during WWII with the U.S. Army Air Corps, advancing to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In 1947 Tom and Sidney G. Burke wed and together raised five sons. Tom derived both personal and professional fulfillment overseeing the expansion of the IESC, which was founded in 1964 by David Rockefeller and Sol Linowitz as a ""business person's Peace Corps,"" whose mission is to promote private enterprise in developing countries. During his tenure from 1981-1993 as president and CEO, the group experienced its greatest growth, to date, and tripled the number of projects undertaken by its volunteers worldwide. Prior to leading the IESC, Tom served as president and CEO of Lever Brothers, from April 1967 until February 1980 when he announced his retirement. He continued as a director of the company and chairman of the finance committee of the board and as a director of Unilever, U.S. until 1983. Tom was trustee emeritus of the Museum of Modern Art, advising the museum in its economic development. He was also a trustee of Catawba College, a Woodrow Wilson Fellow, director of Associates of Harvard Business School, former president of the Harvard Business School Association, chairman of the Grocery Manufacturers of America, member of the board of directors of American Airlines, Interpace Corporation and Associated Dry Goods Corporation. From 1964-1966 Tom served as Police Commissioner in New Canaan, and was an Honorary Deputy Fire Commissioner, NYFD. A lifelong athlete, Tom boxed in his youth and attended Catawba College on a football scholarship. Tom was a tennis champion at both the New Canaan Field and the Country Club of New Canaan. As a member of the Racquet and Tennis Club, Tom was ranked third nationally in 1995-1996 in men's singles squash (75+) by the United States Squash Racquets Association. While raising his family he became an avid skier, returning to Alta, Utah annually from 1965-1999. He skied his last run in the shadow of Mount Baldy at seventy-nine. In 1981, Tom Carroll and Caroline E. Wheelwright married; she predeceased him in 2005. One son, Thomas Jeremiah also predeceased him, in 1973. Tom will be deeply missed by his four sons: Jeffrey, James, Matthew and Charles; favorite daughters-in-law: Lynda, Nancy, and Penny; nine grandchildren: Elizabeth, Julia, Nicholas, Clara, Finn, Amanda, Thomas ""TJ"" Jeremiah, Liam and Dylan; and two stepchildren: George and Sophia Wheelwright. The son of Irish immigrants and the youngest of six fun loving siblings, Tom made the most of his opportunities and, in return, gave generously to many people, rich and poor, around the globe. Tom was and remains a preeminent example of his favorite saying, ""it is better to be born lucky than rich"". A celebration of Tom's life will be held at 2pm on March 21st at the New Canaan Country Club. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that those so inclined send donations to either The Thomas S. Carroll Executive Symposium Endowment at Catawba College, Development Office, 2300 West Innes St., Salisbury, NC 28144, or International Executive Service Corp., 1900 M Street NW, Washington, DC 20036."

Readers are latecomers to the battle over digital price. Until recently, publishers and retailers have hashed it out, with publishers generally worried that $9.99 -- not a magic number but the one that managed to hook digital readers -- devalued books in readers' minds. Publishers gained back ground when Apple and Google indicated they were open to higher prices. Readers may have the last word."

Born on September 1921 in Montreal, he was the son of the former Georgie Brown and William Arthur Mitchell. As a young child, he moved with his family to Short Hills, New Jersey when his father became a partner of J.P. Morgan and Sons. He attended the Buxton School and Avon Old Farms, and graduated from Yale University in 1944. He was a Staff Sergeant in the Army Air Corps and was awarded the Bronze Star. David started his banking career at The Chemical Bank, and later became a Director of S. G. Warburg Ltd. in England, and was the first Managing Director of its American subsidiary. In 1984, he founded Mitchell and Associates, an investment banking boutique, and remained active until his death. Among his many civic and philanthropic involvements, he was a board member for many years of Citizen's Union, the International Center for the Disabled (ICD), and the Board of Associates of the Whitehead Institute. David was also a member of The Century Association, the Rafter Rats and The Friends of Gibraltar Society. He had a strong artistic sensibility and was an avid hiker who climbed the Matterhorn in his early 50s.

Known to family and friends as Kent, he was a man of optimism and integrity who lived with grace, dignity, courage and a love for life, even as his health declined. Born in Berkeley, California, on September 2, 1939 to Arthur Clayton Davis and Katherine (Carr) Davis, he spent his early years there and in San Francisco; he cherished his western roots throughout his life. Kent enjoyed reading, especially history and short stories, and took great pleasure in music, French toast, camping, yoga, tennis, running, walking, hiking, learning Spanish and fly fishing, and he shared his enthusiasm with others whenever possible. The National Parks held a special place in his heart, as did the Hudson River. He loved his family; in recent years he especially enjoyed being ""Gramps"" and inventing songs and reading stories to his two grandchildren. Until his health failed he was an active member of the First Unitarian Society of Westchester and was grateful for the fellowship found there. A graduate of St. Ignatius College Preparatory (1957) and the University of San Francisco (B.S. 1961), Kent served in the US Coast Guard Reserve while continuing studies at Ohio University (M.S. 1968) and Syracuse University (Ph.D. 1971). As part of his doctoral training he completed a child clinical psychology internship at the Astor Home for Children in Rhinebeck, NY. Dr. Davis worked as a child clinical psychologist at Children's Village in Dobbs Ferry until 1977, when he joined New York Medical College as Chief of Pediatric Psychology with service in Pediatrics and Psychiatry at affiliates Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center and Metropolitan Hospital Center. In addition to his clinical responsibilities, Dr. Davis was an educator of medical students and residents, supervisor of psychology interns, and co-author of a book and numerous peer reviewed papers. For many years he was an active member of the Westchester County Psychological Association (WCPA), serving as President (1989-1991), Chair of its Ethics Committee (1982-1985), and on its Board of Directors (1982-1985, 1987-1993); he was honored to receive its Distinguished Service Award in 2005, the year of his retirement. Survivors include his wife of 44 years, Sue (Galasso) of Hastings-on-Hudson; daughter Brigid Davis, son-in-law Iain Bason, and grandchildren of Winchester, MA; daughter Monica Davis and son-in-law Charles Alexander of Arlington, MA; brothers James C.

Built on the Forte platform and designed at Kia's California studio, the front-drive concept is powered by a direct-injection 1.4-liter engine and a 78-kilowatt electric motor. The car has a continuously variable transmission."
2010-02-14T00:00:00Z,"Ms. Salcedo's mash-up submission combines a downward view of the rotunda with a photograph of a New York tenement by the German-born artist Hans Haacke. The tenement photograph, part of his series documenting the holdings of a local real-estate baron, was scheduled to be featured in the 1971 Haacke show at the Guggenheim that was canceled for what were widely believed at the time to be political concerns by the museum's director. ''What Hans was doing was amazing, and it was censored,'' said Ms. Salcedo, a sculptor who is also politically inclined. She wrote to Mr. Haacke to obtain his image and then worked with four architects over several months to create the perfect alignment with the other picture. ''It was a nightmare in Photoshop,'' she said."

2010-02-14T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Kapoor, the sculptor, who currently has a huge steel installation on view at the museum, proposed what he called a ''smoke event,'' a bright red plume that would be released from a smoke machine at the bottom of the rotunda and travel upward. ''Much of my work results in an ephemeral moment,'' he said. The key to the plan, he added, was recognizing that Wright's void is not really a void. ''It's never an empty volume,'' Mr. Kapoor said. ''It's always active, and your body is always active in it.'' The inherent energy of the space, he said, calls for a ''very playful'' response."

2010-02-14T00:00:00Z,"TO paraphrase Jerry Lee Lewis, there is a whole lot of art making going on right now. All different kinds. But you'd hardly know it from the contemporary art that New York's major museums have been serving up lately, and particularly this season. The current exhibition of Gabriel Orozco at the Museum of Modern Art along with the recent ones of Roni Horn at the Whitney Museum and of Urs Fischer at the New Museum have generated a lot of comment pro and con. So has the Tino Sehgal performance exhibition now on view in an otherwise emptied-out Guggenheim rotunda. But regardless of what you think about these artists individually, their shows share a visual austerity and coolness of temperature that are dispiritingly one-note. After encountering so many bare walls and open spaces, after examining so many amalgams of photography, altered objects, seductive materials and Conceptual puzzles awaiting deciphering, I started to feel as if it were all part of a big-box chain featuring only one brand."

We were told this was the biggest cruise ship in the world, and that it was brand new, so we wanted to check it out. The boat is amazing, and really beautiful. With -- what, 6,000 people? -- you can't imagine. It's like a small town. There's a huge park full of trees in the middle of the boat. Then you walk outside, and you can go surfing. The surfing was fantastic. Very challenging and otherworldly -- just like being on the sea, but you're surrounded by this applauding crowd. And there was also this real feeling of freedom. Here you are, surfing on top of a boat, and you can look out and see the sea itself, while being hundreds of feet above it. It's kind of magical.'' As told to Austin Considine"

Surrounded by potted plants, old sewing machines and Russian army coats sent to her by her parents in Belarus, Ms. Kazakevich, 28, makes bags, shoes, belts and other leather goods by hand, from tanning the leather herself to hammering each brass tack. She opened the store in November, paying for it with credit cards and tips from her job as a waitress at Vinegar Hill House in Brooklyn. After deciding not to pursue a career in finance, she learned shoemaking from Barbara Shaum, whose Grecian sandals have been a fixture on East Fourth Street since the '60s. (''It sounds very Daniel Day-Lewis,'' she jokes.) If you like the canvas bag with leather straps, you'll have to be patient: everything is made to order. Prices range from $95 to $125 for belts; $275 and up for bags; and $375 to $425 for sandals and shoes. 105 Henry Street; (646) 479-6035. CHRISTINE MUHLKE"

2010-02-14T00:00:00Z,"TROUSDALE--Sabina Cronin, 67, died unexpectedly on January 16th in the hospital from complications of severe pneumonia. She was the daughter of Sabina Larkin Cronin and Eugene John Cronin, Jr. of New York and the granddaughter of Marie Blanche and Dr. Eugene J. Cronin, Sr., of Cedarhurst, L.I. and Sabina Weber of New York. Born in August 1942, she was the last child recorded in the Havemeyer family history published shortly thereafter. After her parents divorce when she was four, Sabina lived with her mother in Forest Hills Gardens, spending time each summer with her father and a number of aunts and uncles in her grandparents' home. She graduated from Kew Forest School and Southern Seminary in Buena Vista, VA. At that time, always of independent mind, she refused her family's request to be listed in the Social Register. She had a great personal sense of honor and loyalty to good friends that remained with her all her life. Because she was also very talented and creative, she then graduated from the New York School of Interior Design, going on to accept a design assistant position with McMillan, Inc., a leading interior design firm. After several years, she opened her own practice. She never sought publicity for her work, but carried on a very successful practice for many years, primarily in Manhattan, but in Greenwich, Locust Valley and Mill Neck as well, for clients including the then American Minister to Great Britain, Raymond Seitz, Nelson Doubleday and the author, Roxanna Robinson. Later in life, she took up painting and then photography. Her very first painting was accepted for exhibition by the prestigious Silvermine Art Show, vetted by the Curator of Paintings at the Metropolitan Museum, Henry Geldzahler. Sabina accomplished all this through a deep determination to live a normal life, despite a lifelong burden of inherited anxiety and depression. She truly succeeded, but was finally forced to close her practice in 2003 by increasing illness, because she finally felt unable to continue for her clients in the high standards she set for herself. In 1970, she had married Allen Trousdale, an architect and native of Louisiana. Together over the years they restored several historic residences, both in New York and Newburyport, MA, the last a brownstone in Cobble Hill. She is survived by her stepmother, Mrs. Celestine Cronin of Wilton, CT., her half-sister Cathe and her children of Atlanta and her half-brothers, Sean and Christopher Cronin. She is and will be very much missed."

Don believed intensely in the life-changing experience of an Outward Bound course and, with John Mack Carter used his extensive network of publishing contacts to launch a successful Public Service Ad program on our behalf. Since his first Outward Bound course in 1983, Don could often be found climbing Kilimanjaro, trekking in Tibet, river rafting in Colorado, or hiking across England, bringing along with him his peers in the publishing industry, so they too could understand the power of Outward Bound and help expose its mission and educational philosophy to countless young people.

2010-02-15T00:00:00Z,"HAIR is a language; it announces our gender, class and even our politics. George Washington rejected wigs as too aristocratic for the new Republic. He tied his long powdered hair in a ''queue,'' while his successors embraced unpowdered styles inspired by ancient Rome. Federalists like John Adams wore long hair, while Jefferson's Democrats countered with shortened cuts. By the mid-19th century, beards returned after a long absence. Virile-looking and practical on the battlefield, beards were suited to the Civil War; Grant kept his when he entered the White House. The safety razor's invention around 1900 marked the beginning of the end for presidential facial hair. For the last 100 years, there have been very few stylistic developments of note; the most significant change of late comes with our current commander in chief, whose hair has brought welcome diversity to the presidential scalp. -- PENNY HOWELL JOLLY,a professor of art history at Skidmore College and the author of ''Hair: Untangling a Social History''"

Both shows still earned less than two-thirds of their maximum possible potential grosses, however. The musical revival ""Hair,"" which has also seen a decline in ticket sales recently, also increased its grosses by $111,744, to $593,128, though swaths of seats still went empty at some performances. Most other plays and musicals did better at the box office as well, in part because of Presidents' Day vacation schedules, but the performance was still notable given the fears about ticket falloff because of a snowstorm across the New York City area last Wednesday."

Since my student days in the 1970s I'd been dimly aware of this: soon after my arrival, my friend Tom introduced me to a brownish substance called Patum Peperium - The Gentleman's Relish (see here), which came in a lovely ceramic tub (now plastic except for special presentation packs) and which consisted of anchovies, butter and seasonings.

2010-02-16T13:11:23Z,"Richard Misrach's large-scale photographs now on view at PaceWildenstein are stunning examples of landscape photography, but not for the reason you might think. These are not the ominous aerial views of beaches or the desert vistas we've come to know as his work. Instead, all of the images in this show have been inverted to resemble enormous color negatives. While the environments are still recognizable, many of the photos - like one in which a lone figure appears like a specter in the distance - seem almost supernatural. Misrach shot most of these landscapes and seascapes with an advanced digital camera and then reversed the positive captures to transform them into strange and incongruous settings. The bluish rocks strewn along a craggy shoreline look more like icebergs. Not only does the series continue Misrach's probing exploration of the natural world, but it also reminds us of the rapid demise of analog photography - this is, after all, Misrach's first showing of digital prints. At a time when more and more photographers are embracing digital technologies, it's nice to see work that bridges the medium's past and present."

2010-02-16T00:00:00Z,"To all the other woes of these Winter Olympics, one can add malfunctioning ice resurfacing machines. At the Richmond Olympic Oval on Monday night, two machines broke down while smoothing the ice midway through the first round of the men's 500 meters, causing a delay of over an hour. The scene overshadowed the speedskating, which as far as the partisan crowd was concerned was probably just as well. After the machines sputtered, so did Canada's favorite speedskating son, Jeremy Wotherspoon. Trying for the fourth time to win his first Olympic gold in his specialty race, Wotherspoon finished ninth. Mo Tae-bum of South Korea won the gold with a total time of 1 minute 9.82 seconds. He was followed by Japan's Nagashima Keilchiro and Joji Kato."

2010-02-16T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (13); 11 P.M. (49) MINE In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which hit in August 2005, the filmmaker Geralyn Pezanoski headed to New Orleans, where for six weeks she documented efforts to rescue animals left behind when residents were separated from their pets. Many of these animals, like the puppy above, were loaded onto trucks and planes and sent to shelters around the country, where they were adopted by other families and given new names. In this ''Independent Lens'' presentation, Ms. Pezanoski tells the story of some pet owners struggling to find their companions and bring them home --like Malvin Cavalier, who had to leave his dog behind when he sought shelter in the Superdome, and Gloria Richardson, who refused to evacuate without her black Labrador, but was then forcibly separated from it by the authorities. The film also examines what happens when two families grow attached to the same pet.

2010-02-16T00:00:00Z,"Last year, the State Legislature levied a new tariff on most of the businesses in the New York City region. The metropolitan commuter transportation mobility tax requires employers to set aside 34 cents for every $100 in payroll costs, and hand the money over to a battered, barely breathing patient on the state's fiscal operating table: the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The tax has not worked out so well. So far, its projected revenues are coming in about $400 million below the state's estimates -- which, in part, will mean reduced subway and bus service for New Yorkers starting this summer. It has also prompted a furious backlash from suburban officials who resent bankrolling an agency that, they say, benefits the city at the expense of its surrounding counties."

""Rising 11 feet and higher, wearing business suits and ties and nondescript dresses, they have a spookily imposing physical presence and a clunky, cartoonish ugliness."" These massive, mysterious sculptures are on view at ""<b>Bigger, Better, More: The Art of Viola Frey</b>"" through May 2 at the Museum of Arts and Design at Columbus Circle. A few more by Frey can also be seen at the Nancy Hoffman Gallery in Chelsea through Saturday. Unlike the museum, the gallery provides the kind of space the pieces deserve, but both exhibits showcase the work of ""a true original,"" whose pieces, ""because of their size and their blank or seemingly angry expressions, may remind you of what it was like to be a child among grown-ups troubled by incomprehensible problems."""
2010-02-17T00:00:00Z,"Where is the best pizza in New York? For many of this city's residents the question takes on proportions that are nothing less than <a href=""http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/when-the-moon-hits-your-eye/?8ur&emc=ur"">existential</a>. Thankfully, for the moment, at least, foodie rabbi <a href=""http://events.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/dining/reviews/17rest.html?8ur&emc=ur"">Sam Sifton has an answer</a>. <b>Motorino</b> ""serves the city's best pizza,"" he writes. The restaurant, which has locations in Brooklyn and the East Village, has attracted culinary celebrities like Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli, who run the Frankies's restaurants, and Rachel Ray. Made to the chef <b>Mathieu Palombino</b>'s specifications and ""cooked in the tempering heat of a wood fire, his crust emerges from the oven as a Neapolitan fantasy of crispness that is also pillowy and soft, sweet but not sugared, tangy without too much salt."" Multiple visits to the restaurants conform: ""Motorino pies are great hot out of the oven, five minutes later, 10. You can order too much, watch a pie go cool on the plate, eat it anyway and discover: terrific. You can order pizzas to take out, drive them across the boroughs in freezing conditions, get home and reheat the pies: still terrific. Even a slice in the morning, fridge-cooled mozzarella over tangy red sauce, exhibits the pliancy and flavor of bread, not cardboard."" "

2010-02-17T00:00:00Z,"MEYERS--Betty Gardner of Santa Fe, NM passed away peacefully at home on Thursday, February 11, 2010. Her partner, Diane B. Jergins, also of Santa Fe, NM, was with her as she passed from this world to the next. Ms. Meyers was born on September 14, 1928 in New York City where she grew up. She graduated from high school at sixteen and finished college in just three years earning her bachelors degree from Syracuse University at just nineteen years old. Ms. Meyers married Edward M. Meyers and they had two children together. Ms. Meyers and her former husband championed advancements that revolutionized the advertising industry on New York's Madison Avenue during the 1950s and 1960s. After divorcing, Ms. Meyers moved to Santa Fe and built her life with Diane B. Jergins. Together they opened a store called Cook Works which offered comprehensive culinary and cookware items for the novice cook as well as the seasoned chef. They expanded the store to include two others: one for fine dining instruments and table wares; the other for superb foods, rare coffees and teas and other gourmet items. Ms. Meyers designed the stores with Ms. Jergins to reflect a particular level of taste and to offer the accoutrements of fine cooking and dining elegance to the public at large. Their clientele came from across the United States to shop in a store where the best was essential but was not necessarily the most expensive: it was simply what they found to be the best: of design, of function -- the best. The couple traveled the globe in search of those rarified items which would continue their store's beautiful mission -- a mission that grew out of Ms. Meyers' impeccable and unerring vision. Betty Gardner Meyers is survived by her loving partner, Diane B. Jergins of Santa Fe with whom she shared her life. She is also survived by her daughter, Elizabeth Meyers Rogers, 56, and her grandson, Matthew Adam Portnoy, 21, both of New Jersey and with whom she was especially close. Ms. Meyers is also survived by two granddaughters, Clare Meyers and Cynthia Meyers of California, and a son, William Meyers. Ms. Meyers was buried privately in Santa Fe. In lieu of flowers, please make memorial contributions to the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival.

His affable and kind nature made him a friend to all who knew and worked with him, and his enthusiasm for his profession was embraced by generations of radiologists who he mentored. Dr. Goldman's tenure at North Shore-LIJ dates back to 1976, when he joined the radiology department at North Shore University Hospital (NSUH) in Manhasset, NY, after completing his residency and fellowship at McGill University in Montreal. He was appointed chief of diagnostic ultrasound and body computed tomography at NSUH in 1980, named associate chairman of radiology in 1992 and promoted chairman in 1998, following the death of his friend and colleague Roger Hyman, MD. Shortly thereafter, he became the clinical leader of radiology at both NSUH and LIJ Medical Center. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife Barbara, daughter Amy, parents Leo and Beatrice Goldman, sister Laura Chasin and the entire family. Michael Dowling, President & CEO Saul Katz, Chairman"

Lewis, of Basking Ridge, NJ, a loving husband, father and grandfather and a prominent thoracic surgeon, peacefully passed away at home surrounded by his loving family on February 15, 2010 of advanced cancer. Dr Lewis spent his whole professional career caring for and helping others. He made enormous contributions to the field of thoracic surgery. He was a graduate of Manhattan College and Cornell University Medical School. He completed his surgical training at New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center and opened his surgical practice in New Jersey in the mid 1960's. During his career, Dr Lewis participated in the development of Robert Wood Johnson Medical School where he became a clinical professor of thoracic surgery. Dr Lewis was also Chief of Thoracic Surgery at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, St Peter's University Hospital and Somerset Medical Center. He served as president of the NJ Society of Thoracic Surgeons and was a member of the American College of Surgeons, the American Association for Thoracic Surgery and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons in which he held numerous offices. As an innovative surgeon, Dr Lewis made many contributions to the field of Thoracic Surgery. He published original works in peer reviewed medical journals and surgical textbooks and he developed surgical techniques and surgical instruments. Dr Lewis was a pioneer in the surgical technique ""VATS"", (Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery) which resulted in far less pain for the patient, quicker recovery with shorter hospital stays and speedier return to work. This is one of the new surgical techniques currently used in thoracic surgery worldwide today. Dr Lewis taught and performed his surgical techniques at many national and international medical centers. Prominent surgeons came to New Brunswick, NJ, from throughout the US and abroad to enroll in courses which he taught on VATS. Patients also traveled from various areas to benefit from these techniques. Dr Lewis received many prestigious medical awards and honors from countries in Europe, Asia and South America. He received NJ Pride Award as well as ""America's Best Doctors"" award. He retired from surgery in 2000 but remained active and continued to publish in the field of thoracic surgery. Dr Lewis had a long and distinguished career in surgery, but he always said his greatest accomplishment in life was enjoying his loving family. He made it a priority to attend his six children's activities as frequently as possible and to participate in their daily lives. This, he felt, developed a sound and strong relationship with his family. Dr Lewis is survived by his loving wife of 50 years, Pat, whom he met at New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center where she was a nurse. He remained devoted to her his entire life. He leaves behind his six children who were his pride and joy, who will miss very much. Deirdre Lewis Bichsel and her husband Rick, of Cranbury, NJ; Tom Lewis and his wife Ann of Lawrenceville, NJ; Kimberly Lewis Roswech and her husband John of Chester, NJ; Paul Lewis and his wife Micheline of Asbury, NJ; Peter Lewis and his wife Danette of Peapack, NJ; and Greg Lewis and his wife Lauren of Summit, NJ. Dr Lewis also leaves behind 17 grandchildren who adored their grandpa. They are: Meredith, Whitney, Jonathan, Kylie and Helen Bichsel; Brad, Parker and Gwyneth Lewis; Connor and Megan Roswech; Matthew, Madeleine, Morgan and Mikaela Lewis; Mason and Logan Lewis; and Alexandra Lewis.

Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes, Jr. who led the US Food and Drug Administration during the Tylenol crisis of 1982 and was a nationally known professor of clinical pharmacology, died on February 11, 2010 from complications caused by a chronic illness. In 1981, Dr. Hayes was appointed Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration by President Ronald Reagan. During his years at the agency, he directed the FDA's response to the Tylenol tampering cases, called for a voluntary moratorium on direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines and weathered criticism on the FDA's approval of the sweetener aspartame. Born in Highland Park, Michigan in 1933 to Arthur Hull Hayes and Florence (Gruber) Hayes, he loved to travel and visited countries on five continents with his wife of 49 years. In 1970, he and his wife co-founded a medical clinic on the Pacific island of Pohnpei, and they worked as a doctor and nurse team on behalf of the Jesuit Missions. Hayes was ordained a permanent deacon in the Roman Catholic Church in 1978 and served in parishes in Pennsylvania, Maryland and New York. Dr. Hayes received his A.B. in philosophy magna cum laude from Santa Clara University in 1955 and then went to Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, earning a degree in philosophy, politics and economics in 1957. He returned to the US to study medicine; first at Georgetown University Medical School and graduated from Cornell University Medical School in 1964. Following his graduation, he served in the United States Army Medical Corps from 1965 to 1967-achieving the rank of Captain. Dr. Hayes worked as an Assistant Professor of medicine and pharmacology and Associate Dean for Academic Programs at Cornell before becoming a Professor of Medicine and Pharmacology and Director of Clinical Pharmacology at Pennsylvania State University Medical School in Hershey, Pennsylvania. After leaving the FDA, Dr. Hayes worked as Provost and Dean at New York Medical College and later, in 1986, was appointed President of E.M. Pharmaceuticals, a division of the German company E. Merck. Five years later, he founded MediScience Associates, a consulting firm, part of Nelson Communications, Inc., and stayed there until 2005, when he retired. Dr. Hayes served on numerous commercial and pro bono boards, received many honorary degrees and awards and was named a visiting professor at a several academic institutions. He consulted for a dozen foreign governments, authored more than a hundred professional papers, delivered thousands of lectures and trained many clinical pharmacologists working today. He is survived by his wife, Barbara Anne (Carey) of Oxford, CT ; his three children Arthur of Westport, CT, Lisa of The Netherlands and Kathy of Oxford, CT and their spouses; two sisters, MaryAnn Kelley of Kensington, MD and Florence of Southbury, CT, a brother, Joseph of New York, and eight grandchildren.

2010-02-17T00:00:00Z,"GILGORE--Sheldon G.,MD. February 13, 1932February12, 2010. A leader in the pharmaceutical industry who led some of the nation's top companies and championed patients' rights and product integrity, died at his home in Naples, FL, of pancreatic cancer. He was 77. Known for his innovative marketing strategies and his early work as an endocrinologist who participated in important diabetes research, Dr. Gilgore was one of the very few industry leaders trained as a physician, and this gave him valuable insights into the needs and rights of patients as he continued his career in the pharmaceutical industry. As president of Pfizer Pharmaceuticals from 1971 to 1986, Dr. Gilgore established a reputation as an innovative marketing executive overseeing an unprecedented period of growth and product innovation in Pfizer's evolution. He later would become Chairman, CEO and President of G.D. Searle, succeeding Donald Rumsfeld, from 1986 until his retirement in 1995. His transformative leadership ironically positioned the company to become -- after his tenure -- an acquisition of Pfizer, where he had started his corporate career. Sheldon G. Gilgore was born in Philadelphia, PA, attended Villanova University and graduated from Jefferson Medical School in 1956 at the precocious age of 24. Dr. Gilgore was a past Chairman of PHARMA (the pharmaceutical industry trade organization formerly known as PMA), which flourished under his leadership. Dr. Gilgore's interest in the arts was profound and perhaps best exemplified by an art collection assembled by him and his wife, Irma, who is a highly successful painter. Housed in a private museum that they established, the frequently touring Gilgore Collection is widely viewed as the most important collection of 19th century Italian painting and sculpture outside of Italy. Pieces from their collection have been exhibited at the Chicago Art Institute, the Philadelphia Museum of Fine Arts and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Rovereto, Italy. Future exhibitions include Cologne, Copenhagen and Italy. A former resident of Winnetka, Ill., Dr. Gilgore was a past Board Director of Chicago Lyric Opera and Evanston Hospital. In Philadelphia, the city of his birth, he served on the Board of the Philadelphia Grand Opera. His love of opera led to his founding two opera companies in Connecticut. He served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Clark University in the 1980s and on the board of his alma mater, Jefferson Medical College, where he was honored with their annual ""Distinguished Alumni Award"" in 1986. He also served as Chairman of Applied Microbiology from 1995 to 1997. Dr. Gilgore's passion for beautiful automobiles, sports and the arts was exceeded only by his love of family, particularly his life partner and wife of 53 years, Irma (maiden name Swartz), who survives Dr. Gilgore. He is also survived by his sons, Lance, Laurence and Lloyd; his daughters-in-law, Debby, Susan and Cathy; his brother, Dr. Gary Gilgore and his wife, Beth; his five grandchildren, Sara, Jenna, Chloe, Jarrett and Erika; and nieces Gayle, Amy and Jan. Funeral services are private. A Memorial tribute will be scheduled in the near future. For further information, contact Fuller Funeral Home at 239-417-5000. In lieu of flowers, donations made to a charity of one's choice would be greatly appreciated."

2010-02-17T00:00:00Z,"MARCUVITZ--Nathan, 96, died peacefully at home in Naples, Florida, on February 14, 2010. He was an internationally recognized electro-physicist. During WWII he did ground-breaking work at MIT RadLab when a national priority was the rapid development of microwave radar. During that time, he authored the Waveguide Handbook which is still considered a classic work characterizing microwave behavior and is well known to anyone working today in the fields of microwaves or optics. He was a key member of the faculty of Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, later renamed Polytechnic Institute of NY. His primary love was his research in electrodynamics, plasma physics and the supervision of the many graduate students who did their doctoral work with him. From 1963-1964, on leave from Polytechnic, he served as Assistant Director of Defense Research and Engineering for the Department of Defense, under Robert McNamara. At Poly he served in several administrative capacities, as Director of the Microwave Research Institute, Chairman of the Department of Electrophysics and as acting Dean of the Graduate School, but was always drawn back to his research and graduate teaching activities. In 1965 he became an Institute Professor, the first appointment of this kind at Polytechnic. In 1966 he joined the faculty of the School of Engineering and Science at New York University as a Professor of Applied Physics. He returned in 1973 to the newly-merged Polytechnic Institute of New York with the same position and became an emeritus professor in 1979. He was the author of numerous technical papers, book chapters and reports in electromagnetic and plasma wave dynamics. In addition to authoring the Waveguide Handbook he coauthored, with Leo Felson, Radiation and Scattering of Waves, published in 1973. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering and was the recipient of the Microwave Career Award of the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society in 1985 and received the IEEE Heinrich Hertz Award in 1989 for fundamental theoretical and experimental contributions to the engineering formulation of electromagnetic field theory. He received an honorary degree from the Politecnico Di Torino in 1993 and an honorary degree from Polytechnic University in 2000.

''Although the commercial imperatives that drive a movie like this one are understandable -- the novel was a best seller and an Oprah's Book Club selection, for starters -- you have to wonder who, exactly, wants or perhaps needs to see another movie about the Holocaust that embalms its horrors with artfully spilled tears and asks us to pity a death-camp guard,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times.

In 1957 he joined Time magazine in New York, serving as a writer, foreign news-desk editor, Rome bureau chief, deputy chief of correspondents, founding editor of Time's international editions and Washington news editor. He also was the last managing editor of the Time-owned Washington Star, in 1981. After retiring from Time in 1986, he edited World Press Review for five years. He held leadership posts in the Overseas Press Club and the Correspondents Fund, and endowed journalism scholarships at Washington & Lee, UNC-Chapel Hill, and UC-Berkeley. He had a keen mind and boundless curiosity, traveled widely, loved good food and talk, followed sports avidly, and was an astute student of politics and the media. To his family, he was above all an engaged, generous, and supportive husband, father, father-in-law, and grandfather. His marriage to Margaret Jackson ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Kathleen Beakley, of New York, two sons from his first marriage, Roger (Pam Percy), of Northfield, MN, and Blair (Regan McMahon), of Oakland, CA, and grandchildren, Ian of St. Paul, MN, and Kyle and Hayley of Oakland.

2010-02-21T00:00:00Z,"''NERD CHIC'' is how Victoria Beckham described her collection of sunglasses, which she introduced last week alongside her fall lineup of dresses. They were little round spectacles worn with corseted cocktail numbers and five-inch platforms. ''I guess that's how you could describe my personal style as well,'' she added. Mmm ... not really. But it is the look that many women, including Chloë Sevigny (below right) , have been going for lately, with tailored blouses, tucked in and buttoned-up tight. And from Marc Jacobs to Miu Miu, Christopher Kane to Chloé, it was the desired effect on many spring runways -- and several fall ones. Of course, worn with a short skirt and ankle boots, as it was for Preen's fall collection (center), or a shot of lipstick and a leopard belt, as Ms. Sevigny sported it, the very prim look takes on a kind of hard-edged cool -- which is much more of Ms. Beckham's groove, we'd say."

2010-02-21T00:00:00Z,"FRENCH cinema has produced some notable gangster characters and crime films over the years. During their long careers Jean-Paul Belmondo, Alain Delon and Jean Gabin portrayed underworld figures with swagger, world-weariness or elegance, and even after 50 years Jacques Becker's ''Night Watch'' still stands as one of the most memorable psychological dramas ever set in a prison. But Jacques Audiard turns many of the conventions of the genre upside down in ''A Prophet'' (''Un Prophète''), which may help explain why the film won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival last year and has been nominated for an Academy Award as best foreign film. Shunning the standard-issue tough-guy protagonist, Mr. Audiard instead offers the story of Malik El Djebena, a meek, illiterate Arab street urchin who manages to survive and prosper in prison through guile and intelligence, not intimidation."

A cruise newbie, Ms. Brown easily got seasick and was dumfounded by things like preset dining times. She described her attitude back then as ''Frankly, it's not my style of travel.'' But that didn't stop an editor at The Washington Post from assigning her the cruise beat, and after her first trip, on Celebrity's Zenith ship, she got hooked. Thirteen years and 150 cruises later, the 47-year-old is now an aficionado (she even met her husband on a cruise), and has since moved on from The Post to become editor in chief of CruiseCritic.com, an online magazine and discussion board devoted to all things seaworthy (and not so seaworthy).

2010-02-21T00:00:00Z,"The provocative photographer and filmmaker Shirin Neshat has been exploring identity through her art for more than 30 years. Though she is based in New York, her main focus has been her native Iran, especially the situation of Iranian women -- until now. In ''Games of Desire,'' above, an exhibition at La Fábrica Galería (Calle Alameda, 9; 34-91-360-1325; lafabricagaleria.com) that runs through March, Ms. Neshat turns from the Middle East to Laos. Through film and photographs, she focuses on the relationships between men and women through the filter of lam, the disappearing Laotian custom of reciting courtship songs. While her Middle Eastern work is often melancholic, her newest series documents the joyful interaction of elderly men and women, happily engaged in sexual patter. Having met Laotians and discovering the lam ritual in her travels, she returned to make videos in a temple by the Mekong River. Using multichannel video installations, she caught the participants joking, singing, making lewd remarks and teasing one another, all in a manner notably lacking in self-consciousness."

Markt, an exhibition of work that blurs the line between fashion and art, is the latest. Its curator is Diane Pernet, the fashion journalist known for her Marge Simpson-like pompadour and mantilla veil. The show will feature, among its inspired wares, conceptual knitwear by Sandra Backlund (top), intricately constructed dresses from Lamija Suljevic (above), leather and silver jewelry by Graham Tabor and Miguel Villalobos and prints by Hormazd Narielwalla, an artist who makes collages from the Savile Row suit patterns of customers long gone.

Of course she would! How could she not? It is barely an exaggeration to say that you can't have an awards season without Ms. Streep, who has been enmeshed in roughly half of them since 1979, when she was nominated for best supporting actress in ''The Deer Hunter.'' She won that category the next year, for ''Kramer vs. Kramer,'' and was nominated in it once again, in 2003, for ''Adaptation.''

2010-02-22T00:00:00Z,"HEALTH care reform should have two critical goals: reducing costs and covering more people. To meet them, Democrats and Republicans must abandon simplistic, ideologically driven proposals that animate each party's base. Liberals cannot insist on Medicare for all, and conservatives cannot insist on markets for all, plus tort reform. Neither approach will work. Medicare is an inherently inflationary fee-for-service system that rewards volume, not value.

It's just not in the Democratic leaders' DNA. Transforming health care to slow the growth of spending requires a radical restructuring of how health services are paid for. The most powerful way to reduce costs (and make room to expand coverage) is to shift away from ''volume-based'' reimbursement (the more you do, the more money you make) to ''value-based'' reimbursement."

2010-02-22T00:00:00Z,"WHEN Americans think about health care, they think first of health, not finance. They go to the doctor to get well, not to show off their government-issued insurance card. So President Obama's health care reform plan was doomed from the moment the American people figured out that his goal was to spend less on health care. While the president's idea of ''bending the curve'' on health care means cuts in Medicare, to the American people bending the curve means living better and longer. To the folks on Main Street, it means not appointing Kafkaesque committees to measure ''quality-adjusted life years'' but fostering a vibrant climate of scientific research and opening a wider pipeline for new medicines."

Along the way its songs deploy horns and strings, electric guitar and African and Balkan instruments alongside Ms. Newsom's own harp and piano. The title song, which muses on the international intrigues and inner desires of the 19th-century courtesan Lola Montez, runs 11 minutes.
