Having seen the house and gardens, we must say the article is very accurate. We especially enjoyed the motor car in the adjacent building.

1987-12-06T00:00:00Z,LEAD: This is the last week of an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of which little was known in advance and not a great deal was expected in terms of audience response.

The latest, his 39th in the series, is TRICKS (Arbor House, $16.95). ''Tricks,'' because the action takes place on Halloween. And there is plenty of action: a bunch of trick-or-treat kids (or are they kids?) knocking over liquor stores and murdering the owners; a dismembered body; a maniacal sex killer."

Most recently, Book-of-the-Month Records issued a four-LP set (two cassettes or three CD's) and a few years ago CBS issued a clutch of some of the most famous cuts in a series of LP's."
1987-12-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: AT 13, I desperately wanted to be what I then thought was called an adventuress. It took years to discover the true landscape of that word, with its night-prowling denizens and emotional quicksand. And further years to understand that I didn't mean adventurer either, but some compound poet-naturalist-explorer whose snares were sentences and whose darts were tipped with the curare of wonder."

Here, the planners and the voters, not the real-estate developers, hold the power. The process of getting approval to put up a high-rise office building in the downtown business district here is so complex it must make the hardiest developer yearn for the simplicities of doing business in New York."
1987-12-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: PEOPLE CONVINCED that there can't be too much of a good thing prefer their music nonstop, and technology has caught up with them at last.

For a tale that pits Clark Gable against Robert Ryan, ''The Tall Men'' makes a mighty mild movie. The weather is heavier than the plot of this Western, which takes place mostly on a big cattle drive from Texas to Montana - 5,000 head herded by a batch of Mexican hombres from ethnic casting plus a tribe of Sioux to be shot down along the way."

1987-12-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: I must say I find all this negativism concerning the advertising business these days quite extraordinary. Every time I read an article about the megamergers, etc., I read the lines ''A lot of the fun has gone out of the business.'' The irony is that the quote usually comes from those who have become wealthy (thanks to the advertising business) and have sold out in one way or another."

One recent evening, three men and I, related only by the fact that we had worked together on a business deal, found ourselves at large in Houston after a late dinner.

1987-12-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE opera ''Nixon in China'' received its world premiere in October by the Houston Grand Opera. At that time it was much written about, and the range of opinion was extreme. Conservatives denounced or dismissed it tooth and claw. Progressives hailed it, sometimes extravagantly. Modernists were confused; most of them dote on Peter Sellars, the director, but dislike Minimalism, the stylistic school from which the composer, John"

1987-12-06T00:00:00Z,LEAD: AMERICAN culture bears the burdens of tradition lightly if at all. It is both our joy and our calamity and a source of constant confusion. Perhaps it is this kind of rootlessness and free-floating liberty that creates such bewildering events as Friday night's ''Fledermaus'' at the Metropolitan Opera.
1987-12-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: While Soviet-American trade has never been large in volume - it will total only about $2 billion in 1987 - it has been controversial and highly political. In the early 1970's, during the era of detente, American companies began to move into the Soviet Union in a big way.
