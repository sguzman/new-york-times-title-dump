In February, the rival studio Lionsgate announced that it had paid about $5.5 million to distribute the film, about a teenager in 1980s Harlem, which won the the Grand Jury Prize at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. Soon after, the Weinstein Company filed suit against Lionsgate, the film’s producers and the film sales company Cinetic Media, saying that Cinetic had reneged on a deal with the Weinstein Company. In dismissing the breach of contract suit against the film’s producers, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald noted that a transfer of film rights requires a signed agreement, which negotiations between Cinetic and the Weinstein Company never yielded. Lionsgate is planning to release “Precious” on Nov. 6."

2009-09-30T10:55:34Z,"A typical talk-back session after a play involves performers and creative-team members answering questions from curious audience members. But the Broadway transfer of the David Mamet play “Oleanna” is taking a different approach: among the guests who will be fielding inquires after the drama, about a possible act of sexual harassment made by a university professor against his female student, will be Anucha Browne Sanders, a former senior marketing executive for the New York Knicks who sued the team and Madison Square Garden for sexual harassment. Ms. Browne Sanders, who in 2007 won a $11.5 million settlement from the Garden and its chairman, James L. Dolan, is scheduled to appear at a talk-back on Tuesday, following that evening’s preview performance of “Oleanna” at the Golden Theater. Other guests also slated for coming talk-back sessions include former Mayor David N. Dinkins (on Oct. 9), the talk show host Montel Williams (Oct. 10, evening performance) and the outgoing “Law & Order: Criminal Intent” star Kathryn Erbe (Oct. 17, evening performance). “Oleanna,” which stars Bill Pullman and Julia Stiles, began previews on Tuesday and is to have its official opening on Oct. 11."
2009-09-30T11:44:11Z,"When you have starred in one of the most successful television comedies of recent years as well as its less-than-beloved spinoff, what do you do for an encore? Get meta. Matt LeBlanc, who followed 10 seasons on the NBC series “Friends” with 46 episodes of the solo project “Joey,” will return to television in a new show in which he will play a satirical version of himself. The new show, called “Episodes,” will be jointly produced by Showtime and the BBC, the television channels said on Wednesday in a news release, and is created by David Crane (a co-creator of “Friends”) and Jeffrey Klarik. It will focus on a British couple whose hit comedy is reworked for American television in a watered-down version starring Mr. LeBlanc. In a statement, Mr. LeBlanc said he was glad he got the role because “seeing someone else play Matt LeBlanc would have been devastating.” “Episodes” will be produced in London and Los Angeles, and will have its debut on Showtime and BBC Two next year."

In the years since, I've become a partisan in pacifist causes, around which congregates a community that has no patience for packing heat. But I continue to feel that old attraction. I can still get swept away in fantasies of firepower. So nearly a decade into legal age with nary a shot fired, I decided it was time to test my reveries against the real thing: would a gun really satisfy them or cause me to recoil in horror?"

There is, however, elegance in the writing and the cinematography, and lots of pull for the armchair traveler. Each episode features a knotty murder plot and the two agreeable sleuths, but it's the city - Oxford - that stars: sunlit spires, misty punting and the occasional homicidal don.

2009-09-30T00:00:00Z,"BERSON--Iolabee ""Sis"". Our grandmother was one of the most incredible women we have ever known. She was born here in New York, the oldest of four children in the Dworman family. As the only girl, she was raised as ""one of the boys."" She went to college in Macon, Georgia (where they had never seen ""a Jew"" before) and then worked in the family's real estate business. When she married our grandfather (to whom she was married for over 60 years -- as different as two people can be but a real love affair) he was a young physician in private practice. However, our grandmother always encouraged him ""to dream big"" -- as she always did. And so the two of them started to build private hospitals and never looked back. They worked tirelessly -- and side by side. They had two loving daughters together -- Rhetta and Bonnie -- and with that gave birth to a beautiful family tree of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Our grandmother was a New York icon, known throughout New York as a hard-driven businesswoman but always a lady. All of Manhattan knew ""Mrs. Berson"" and she wore the title well. In our grandmother's world, you could never be overdressed. She was a spectacle of perfection, bedecked and bejeweled, from head to toe. Our friends called her Queen Elizabeth and they were not far off. She was known at Old Oaks for appearing at the gym in the early morning wearing white gloves and a Chanel suit in full make-up to ""run"" on the treadmill. Our grandfather worshipped her. He told us that she inspired him to be better and he adored her for that. They had a love affair like no other and their marriage was an amazing example for all of us. We all feel fortunate that our children got to spend such meaningful time with their great-grandmother whom they adored -- and that she got to share with them her stories about how she learned to fly an airplane and rode horses and owned a pet monkey who used to steal her red lipstick. She loved being the focus of their attention and they adored being in her regal presence. We all did. She was truly one of a kind and we will miss her dearly.

2009-09-30T00:00:00Z,"MALONEY--Clifton H. W. Maloney, 71, passed away on September 25th on Cho Oyu Mountain located between the boarder of Nepal and China. He had reached the 27,000 ft summit on the morning of September 24th, making him the oldest American to ever summit an 8,000 meter peak. He spent that night at Base Camp 3 and arrived the following day at Base Camp 2 at 23,000 feet where he died in his sleep. His last words were, ""I'm the happiest man in the world. I've just summited a beautiful mountain."" Born in Philadelphia on October 15, 1937, Mr. Maloney graduated from Princeton University in 1960, Harvard Business School in 1965, and served in the U.S. Navy from 1960-1963. An investment banker and real estate investor, Mr. Maloney worked at several financial services companies, including The City Management Corp, Electronic Bond and Share Company, and New York Securities Co., Inc. In 1974, he became a Vice President of Goldman, Sachs & Co. In 1981, he founded his own company, C.H.W. Maloney & Co., Incorporated, to acquire established businesses for long term investment. Mr. Maloney served as a director of several companies, including The Wall Street Fund, Inc. and Interpool Limited. Mr. Maloney was a dedicated marathon runner who had finished the New York Marathon 20 times and in 2008 finished as the fastest American in his age group. He enjoyed sailing and was a member of the New York Yacht Club. Deeply committed to the quality of life in his local community, Mr. Maloney was on the Board of Civitas and the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens and was active in Carnegie Hill Neighbors. He was the Annual Giving Class Agent for the Princeton Class of 1960 and was proud to report more than 70% class participation. He was an avid mountain climber having climbed five of the Seven Summits (including Mount Elbrus, Aconcagua, Mount Vinson, Denali, and Mount Kilimanjaro). In addition, he climbed Orizaba, Mexico's highest volcano. He was a member of the Explorer's Club and the American Alpine Club. His passion for mountain climbing and an equally great passion for boats of all sorts stemmed from his experiences as a lifelong summer resident of Blue Mt. Lake in the Adirondacks. Mr. Maloney is survived by his wife, Congresswoman Carolyn Jane Bosher Maloney to whom he was married in 1976, his daughters, Christina Paul Maloney and Virginia Marshall Maloney, his mother, Virginia Wells Maloney, his sister, Virginia Maloney Lawrence, and eight nieces and nephews. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the Clifton H.W. Maloney Scholarship Fund at Princeton University, the Explorer's Club or the American Alpine Club.

Released in September 2008 after more than 19 years in prison, Mr. Win Tin remains remarkably spry, upbeat, and politically engaged. A co-founder of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, he is a vocal opponent of taking part in national elections set for next year.

The ""rules"" were simple: we would meet once a month (often with accomplished guests); there would be no more than two from each profession or calling; we would tell one another about our work and our lives; we would teach one another about the world as we saw it and the opportunities it presented. From that humble beginning sprang a group who continued to meet together, though less frequently, right up to today. It bred lifelong friendships, much learning of the ways of the world and produced a host of successful people. Now, over 50 years later, we have lost the man who conceived the idea, brought us together and continued to lead us in the ways of friendship, knowledge and success. We will miss Bill Safire profoundly. We will miss his erudition, his wit and his teaching.

General McChrystal has not spoken with Mr. Obama since submitting his grim assessment of the war a month ago and has spoken with him only once in the 100 days since he took command of all American and NATO forces in Afghanistan.

Both of these have their place, but for those wanting something less traditional, look to the Southwest. Start with sweet potatoes, which are in season, beautiful and cheap, and roast them with red onion and olive oil. Roasting instead of boiling makes a huge difference: not only do you get a rich, smoky flavor, but the peeled exterior is toughened a bit so that the potatoes stay intact when tossed with the other ingredients."

The study said that ABC has the most such characters, with 8 out of 168 total series regulars; Fox has four (including cartoon characters from “The Simpsons” and “American Dad”), NBC has three, CW has two and CBS has none. In its review of mainstream cable channels, including HBO, Showtime, Comedy Central, AMC and others, the alliance found that the number of series regulars who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender decreased this year to 25 from 32 last year. When the gay-oriented cable channels here! and Logo were accounted for, the study said, an additional 27 such characters were added to the tally."

Ms. Browne Sanders, who won an $11.5 million settlement in 2007, is scheduled to appear at a talk-back on Tuesday, after that evening’s preview performance of “Oleanna” at the Golden Theater.

The show, “Episodes,” will be jointly produced by Showtime and the BBC, they said on Wednesday in a news release, and is created by David Crane (a co-creator of “Friends”) and Jeffrey Klarik. It will focus on a British couple whose hit comedy is reworked for American television in a watered-down version starring Mr. LeBlanc. In a statement, Mr. LeBlanc said he was glad he got the role because “seeing someone else play Matt LeBlanc would have been devastating.” “Episodes” will be produced in London and Los Angeles and will have its debut on Showtime and BBC Two next year."

2009-10-01T00:00:00Z,"The Philadelphia Phillies had already clinched their third consecutive National League East title Wednesday night before Brad Lidge threw his first pitch in the ninth inning, but there was no one else Manager Charlie Manuel wanted on the mound. Lidge needed only that one pitch to wrap up a 10-3 victory against the visiting Houston Astros, a spot of good karma for a team facing some problems as it defends its World Series title. Lidge, who lost his closer's role last week, recorded the final out of the Phillies' division-clinching win last season, and Manuel called on him with two outs in the ninth inning Wednesday. He was the final member of a bullpen that pitched five scoreless innings in relief of Pedro Martinez, who threw an inefficient 84 pitches over four innings."

2009-10-01T00:00:00Z,"MALONEY--Clifton H. W. Maloney, 71, passed away on September 25th on Cho Oyu Mountain located between the boarder of Nepal and China. He had reached the 27,000 ft summit on the morning of September 24th, making him the oldest American to ever summit an 8,000 meter peak. He spent that night at Base Camp 3 and arrived the following day at Base Camp 2 at 23,000 feet where he died in his sleep. His last words were, ""I'm the happiest man in the world. I've just summited a beautiful mountain."" Born in Philadelphia on October 15, 1937, Mr. Maloney graduated from Princeton University in 1960, Harvard Business School in 1965, and served in the U.S. Navy from 1960-1963. An investment banker and real estate investor, Mr. Maloney worked at several financial services companies, including The City Management Corp, Electronic Bond and Share Company, and New York Securities Co., Inc. In 1974, he became a Vice President of Goldman, Sachs & Co. In 1981, he founded his own company, C.H.W. Maloney & Co., Incorporated, to acquire established businesses for long term investment. Mr. Maloney served as a director of several companies, including The Wall Street Fund, Inc. and Interpool Limited. Mr. Maloney was a dedicated marathon runner who had finished the New York Marathon 20 times and in 2008 finished as the fastest American in his age group. He enjoyed sailing and was a member of the New York Yacht Club. Deeply committed to the quality of life in his local community, Mr. Maloney was on the Board of Civitas and the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens and was active in Carnegie Hill Neighbors. He was the Annual Giving Class Agent for the Princeton Class of 1960 and was proud to report more than 70% class participation. He was an avid mountain climber having climbed five of the Seven Summits (including Mount Elbrus, Aconcagua, Mount Vinson, Denali, and Mount Kilimanjaro). In addition, he climbed Orizaba, Mexico's highest volcano. He was a member of the Explorer's Club and the American Alpine Club. His passion for mountain climbing and an equally great passion for boats of all sorts stemmed from his experiences as a lifelong summer resident of Blue Mt. Lake in the Adirondacks. Mr. Maloney is survived by his wife, Congresswoman Carolyn Jane Bosher Maloney to whom he was married in 1976, his daughters, Christina Paul Maloney and Virginia Marshall Maloney, his mother, Virginia Wells Maloney, his sister, Virginia Maloney Lawrence, and eight nieces and nephews. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the Clifton H.W. Maloney Scholarship Fund at Princeton University, the Explorer's Club or the American Alpine Club. The funeral will be held next Friday, at 11am on October 9th, 2009, at the Brick Church on Park Avenue between East 91st and East 92nd Streets in Manhattan."

Needing three outs to complete a 4-2 victory Wednesday against the Nationals in Washington, the Mets turned the game over to closer Francisco Rodriguez, who gave up a two-out, full-count, bases-loaded home run to the rookie Justin Maxwell. Final score: Nationals 7, Mets 4. In addition to losing a third straight game to the Nationals, the Mets announced that shortstop Jose Reyes had further damaged his injured hamstring and will almost certainly need surgery. The Mets' season long ago turned into a blur of injuries and mind-boggling defeats, and Wednesday was just the latest example."

It was over 50 years ago that Bill got the idea of bringing together a group of young men who had come to New York to build their careers. The ""rules"" were simple: we would meet once a month (often with accomplished guests); there would be no more than two from each profession or calling; we would tell one another about our work and our lives; we would teach one another about the world as we saw it and the opportunities it presented. From that humble beginning sprang a group who continued to meet together, though less frequently, right up to today. It bred lifelong friendships, much learning of the ways of the world and produced a host of successful people. Now, over 50 years later, we have lost the man who conceived the idea, brought us together and continued to lead us in the ways of friendship, knowledge and success. We will miss Bill Safire profoundly. We will miss his erudition, his wit and his teaching.

On Friday, a five-day preview opened for a sale of 467 lots from the soprano Beverly Sills’s estate. Doyle has largely cleared out her apartment on Central Park West and reassembled some room settings at the salerooms for Wednesday’s auction.

Sills, who was always attending or hosting benefits, stocked her apartment with huge sets of bone china and glassware and dozens of jeweled evening bags. Doyle is selling her mink and sable coats and some elementary school report cards."
2009-10-02T12:28:06Z,"The thief or thieves who stole millions of dollars’ worth of artwork from private collectors in Pebble Beach, Calif., left behind a ransom note demanding money, The Californian reported. Thirteen works, including pieces by Matisse, Miró, Rembrandt, Renoir, van Gogh and Jackson Pollock were reported stolen Friday from the home of A. Benjamin Amadio and Dr. Ralph Kennaugh. In a news release, they said the ransom note was found Tuesday by police officers, but did not say in the release the amount of the ransom being asked. The Monterey County Sheriff’s Office confirmed to The Californian the existence of the ransom note. The Pollock work was estimated to be worth between $20 million and $60 million, while the other pieces are collectively estimated at $7 million in value. The collectors have offered a $1 million reward for the return of the paintings and $5 million for the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator or perpetrators of the theft. A lawyer for the collectors did not immediately return a request for comment."

More specifically, my job as a journalist required me to sit at a battered kitchen table in the middle of the Wind River Indian Reservation, swapping stories with a quadriplegic Northern Arapaho horse gentler and traditional healer named Stanford Addison. I went home with nothing particularly resolved, but happier than I'd been in years. Stanford had lost more than anyone I'd ever known. He was paralyzed at age 20, when the truck in which he was traveling to a party hit some horses wandering on a dark reservation road. But by the time I arrived 23 years later, he was holding sweat lodges to help his neighbors twice a week. He was assisted in the lodge and the corral by young men and kids, some adopted as his own children, others just passing through or released to him by tribal courts and social programs. When the beds filled up, kids and other visitors slept sprawled on couches or on the floor."

Underwear as outerwear was already a trend in Milan. Now, thanks to Copping's Parisian coquettes, it's one that's sure to gain traction.Another newcomer to the main stage is Rodolfo Paglialunga, who recently decamped from Prada to head up Vionnet. Many of Madeleine Vionnet's masterful pieces from the 1930s are currently being exhibited at the Musée des Arts Decoratifs, so it was easy to understand how Paglialunga sought to make her groundbreaking experiments with draping and construction newly relevant. Among his standouts were brightly printed, jeweled dresses made from a single piece of skillfully manipulated fabric."

2009-10-02T00:00:00Z,"In 1962 the Italian poet, novelist and cinema immortal Pier Paolo Pasolini talked for the first time about a movie he was about to begin, a work he called an ''essay in film journalism,'' titled ''La Rabbia'' (''Rage''). It was a curious, unlikely project for Pasolini. It had been commissioned by a producer, Gastone Ferranti, who, according to the Italian scholar Roberto Chiesi, was in the market for an exploitation flick along the lucrative lines of ''Mondo Cane,'' a 1962 Italian feature compilation of found footage and cheap shocks that resulted in untold imitations. What Ferranti got instead was a passionate tour of the frenzied spectacles of the 20th century -- with stops in Italy and France, as well as in Hungary and Korea -- that Pasolini characterized as ''an act of indignation against the unreality of the bourgeois world and the historical irresponsibility to which it gives rise.'' Using existing documentary and newsreel images shot by anonymous others, Pasolini rewrote history through montage."

The Friday-nights-in-October fright fest begins with an hourlong documentary, hosted by TCM's resident godfather, Robert Osborne, that examines the various types of thrillers (political, crime, gothic, psychological or just plain good) and the tools filmmakers use to keep viewers on the edges of their seats. Those interviewed include Ken Follett, Diablo Cody, Kenneth Branagh, Mel Brooks, Norman Lloyd and Martin Landau. Two thrillers by Hitchcock, who gets his own category -- ''The Master of Suspense'' -- follow. ''Rear Window'' (1954), with James Stewart (above), will be shown at 9 and ''Shadow of a Doubt'' (1943) at midnight. 8 P.M.

Tucked in the curve where the Sangre de Cristo range meets the San Luis Valley, 30 square miles of sand pile up in dunes as high as 750 feet. On the drive toward the park along the flat expanse of the valley, the dunes materialize unexpectedly, as if someone had superimposed the Sahara onto Colorado's lush, blue-green mountains. Last month my husband, Jeff, and I, along with our three small children, hiked through the sand sheet, the vegetated stretch of sand surrounding the dunes. In the distance a fuzzy-antlered elk nibbled on Indian rice grass. Yucca and prickly pear cactus lined the trail, which led us to the base of the dunes. The children cooked sand cakes and lay down to make sand angels. They dug until they hit water, then jumped into the mucky pit, barefoot and giggling."

Among many other roles, David was a veteran faculty member and chair of the Department of Management; his area of special expertise was operations management. He was well known and beloved by a great many of us because, in the later part of his career, he was called on to assume a variety of administrative positions. Beginning in the mid 1990s, he served as Associate Dean, then in 1999 as Acting Dean of the Zicklin School of Business; Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs; Acting Dean of the Weissman School and Special Adviser to the President. His expertise in managing complex systems, along with his unwavering loyalty to Baruch College, made him a man for all seasons.

2009-10-02T00:00:00Z,"The pile of gear laid out in our garage was incongruous: sand shovels and pails, skis, sun hats, a snow sled. We were packing for a trip to Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve in southern Colorado. Tucked in the curve where the Sangre de Cristo range meets the San Luis Valley, 30 square miles of sand pile up in dunes as high as 750 feet. On the drive toward the park along the flat expanse of the valley, the dunes materialize unexpectedly, as if someone had superimposed the Sahara onto Colorado's lush, blue-green mountains. Last month my husband, Jeff, and I, along with our three small children, hiked through the sand sheet, the vegetated stretch of sand surrounding the dunes. In the distance a fuzzy-antlered elk nibbled on Indian rice grass. Yucca and prickly pear cactus lined the trail, which led us to the base of the dunes. The children cooked sand cakes and lay down to make sand angels. They dug until they hit water, then jumped into the mucky pit, barefoot and giggling."

2009-10-02T00:00:00Z,"CATTO--Jessica Hobby, noted conservationist, journalist and Democratic stalwart, died on September 30, 2009, after a lengthy battle with colon cancer. Her powerful spirit and humor, love of family and desire to keep fighting for causes she considered vital kept her thriving far beyond her original prognosis, and she died at her beloved ranch in Woody Creek, Colorado. She was 72. Mrs. Catto reveled in the earth's beauty and was intent on preserving it. As a member of the Chairman's Council of Conservation International and the boards of directors of the National Parks Conservation Association, World Resources Institute, the Conservation Fund and the Environmental Defense Fund, her environmental work and philanthropy spanned decades and continents. Under the umbrella of the American Land Trust Association and Conservation Fund she established the American Land Conservation Award, given annually to a citizen conservationist. But she was most proud of the local conservation measures she undertook in her beloved Roaring Fork Valley near Aspen. When hosting fundraisers for pro-conservation candidates or groups at her Woody Creek home, Mrs. Catto often invited her guests to ""Look at this view,"" a stunning one of wildflower meadows, aspen groves and the 14,000-foot Elk Mountain range beyond. She'd then ask, ""Do you want to keep it?"" At the Aspen Institute she and her husband, Henry E. Catto, Jr., established the Catto Fellowship for a Sustainable Future, which each year brings a group of young leaders selected from around the world to Aspen to discuss solutions to environmental problems, primarily climate change. The fellowship was among her proudest accomplishments. ""They are committed to working out a world architecture and framework for climate change control,"" Mrs. Catto said recently. ""And I hope they succeed."" Mrs. Catto, who divided her time between Woody Creek and San Antonio, was born in Houston to one of Texas' first families. Her father, William P. Hobby, Sr., was governor from 1917 to 1921, and her mother, Oveta Culp Hobby, served as the first commanding officer of the Women's Army Corps during World War II and as the first secretary of Health, Education and Welfare under President Eisenhower. Her family's ownership of the Houston Post Company exposed Mrs. Catto to journalism at an early age, and writing and editing remained lifelong passions. She published a novel and a collection of poetry and wrote a blog for thehuffingtonpost.com on conservation, press and political issues right up until her death. She also wrote pieces for The Washington Post and, in England, for the Independent, the Sunday Times and the Guardian. As vice chairman of H&C Communications, a Texas-based company of network affiliated television stations, she was also a shrewd and farsighted practitioner of the business side of media. Her 1958 marriage to Henry Catto took her first to his hometown of San Antonio--where she was a trustee of Trinity University--then to Washington, DC and around the world. Mr. Catto served as U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador, the United Nations in Geneva and Great Britain. He also held numerous posts in Washington, including White House chief of protocol, director of the United States Information Agency and assistant secretary of defense. Mr. and Mrs. Catto became fixtures on the Washington political and social scenes and amassed numerous lifelong friends there in politics, policy and media. President Nixon appointed Mrs. Catto to the Kennedy Center's Presidential Advisory Committee on the Arts, and President Clinton named her to the Advisory Board of the National Parks System in 1993. From 1980 to 1987 she published the Washington Journalism Review (now the American Journalism Review) and remained a contributing editor there for the rest of her life. Despite her marriage of 52 years to a highly visible Republican, Mrs. Catto proved a tireless fundraiser, hostess, campaigner and policy point person for countless Democratic candidates and causes. She is survived by her husband, Henry; children Heather Catto Kohout of Austin, Texas, John of Basalt, Colorado, Will of Chevy Chase, Maryland and Isa Catto Shaw of Woody Creek; 11 grandchildren; and a brother, William P. Hobby, Jr., of Houston.

It bred lifelong friendships, much learning of the ways of the world and produced a host of successful people.

2009-10-02T00:00:00Z,"The Mets said they were confident that the right hamstring Jose Reyes tore during a workout Tuesday would heal on its own and not need surgery. But they were still deliberating whether surgery to remove his hamstring tendon, which he tore four months ago, could be avoided. That is a likely course of action, and the Mets are expected to announce a decision by Sunday's season finale at Citi Field. They expect Reyes to be ready for spring training. After seemingly overcoming an assortment of leg injuries to emerge as one of the Mets' most durable players, Reyes felt soreness behind his calf in May and was shut down after re-injuring it while trying to come back too soon. The team does not believe the existing tendon injury precipitated the tear, but it is possible Reyes adjusted his running style to compensate for the discomfort."

The Pittsburgh Penguins have essentially the same offensive firepower that led it to the Cup title in a tremendous seven-game finals last spring, powered by the young tandem of Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. Now Coach Dan Bylsma will have a whole season at the helm, which means more loose practices and fun that defy the N.H.L.'s customary emphasis on joyless work.

2009-10-03T00:00:00Z,"As if the struggling Los Angeles Dodgers did not have enough to worry about trying to hold off the Colorado Rockies for the National League West title, they received more disconcerting news. Pitcher Hideki Kuroda, who was stellar in the playoffs a year ago, will be sidelined for the National League Division Series with a herniated disk in his neck, Manager Joe Torre said. If the discomfort subsides, he could return for a later round in the playoffs. Torre said the injury did not appear to be related to the line drive that hit Kuroda in the head on Aug. 15. BILLY WITZ"

Dykstra's 1986 World Series ring was sold for $56,762.50 at an auction in Dallas. The winning bidder was from Queens, paying almost three times what Heritage Auctions expected to bring in. After leaving the game, Dykstra ran a series of successful car washes in California that he sold. He used the proceeds to invest in the stock market and start a magazine for professional athletes. Dykstra was hit by the downturn in the housing and stock markets. To raise money, he pawned his rings and other memorabilia, including bats and balls. When Dykstra failed to repay his loans to Yossi Dina, the so-called pawnbroker to the stars, Dina contacted Heritage Auctions. The 11 lots brought in more than $162,000. KEN BELSON"

Day Three at ACL can safely be described as a slog: Mud Central, Humidity City. Walking away from the XBox 360 Stage, where White Lies were rampaging through their usual brooding fare, I had to concentrate on keeping my balance on terrain that resembled warm chocolate pudding (with a distinctly earthier aroma). But the crowd in front of the Austin Ventures stage, dancing and head-bobbing to a set by Bret Dennen, don’t seem the slightest bit fazed.

Mr. Polanski agreed to the settlement in 1993, but as of 1996 still had not made the payment, according to court records that were provided to media outlets in Los Angeles in response to requests for access to the old case. It remained unclear whether the settlement was ever paid, though Ms. Geimer was still trying to collect as of 1996, by which time accrued interest had pushed the amount to over $600,000, according to the court records."

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"“I never relax,” Pedro Friedeberg insists. “My art is my therapy, my medication.” The first major retrospective of the work of the 73-year-old artist will open on Oct. 15 at the Museo del Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City and includes paintings, prints, drawings, sculpture and furniture. Friedeberg’s iconic hand chairs, which he began making in 1962, have been objects of desire for boldface design-world names from Arnold Scaasi to Kelly Wearstler. The Surrealist writer and poet André Breton was also mesmerized by the chair, as were Yul Brynner, Roman Polanski and Jeanne Moreau. The son of German Jews, Friedeberg fled Europe with his mother during World War II and settled in Mexico’s capital. James Oles — an art historian who is the curator of the exhibition — describes Friedeberg’s art as “fusing late Surrealism with Op and Pop Art,” while the artist himself cites the trompe l’oeil heads of Giuseppe Arcimboldo and the lithographs and woodcuts of M. C. Escher as inspirations. A monograph by Trilce Ediciones will accompany the exhibition, and next month, Reyna Henaine, a promoter of Latin American arts, will host a Friedeberg exhibition in New York, which can be seen by appointment only.

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"Activated charcoal isn’t the messy stuff that fuels barbecues — it’s what’s inside water purifiers, and it’s what hospitals give to people who have swallowed poison. And though you’d never know it by the looks of these glassy black branches, which could have been plucked from a Grimm fairy tale, it’s also what Sort of Coal is made of: highly skilled Japanese and Korean craftsmen heat pieces of oak in an oxygen-starved kiln until they turn to carbon. Swizzling one of the twigs in your pitcher or placing the stump in your living room is enough to clean your water or air. “It’s beautiful because you can see it’s a natural material, it isn’t hidden behind some plastic filter,” says Pernille Lembcke, the co-founder of the Danish brand, which just began selling Sort of Coal in the United States through Design Within Reach. She and her partner, Louise Vilsgaard, began importing top-grade white charcoal — long used in this manner in Asia — as an attempt to shift Western views about cleanliness: “We use chemicals and perfumes to make things clean,” Lembcke says. “We’ve forgotten that nature has its own way of purifying itself.” [?][?][?] MONICA KHEMSUROV."

That demure domesticity prompted many boomer babes to vault the white picket fences and escape similar, Betty Crockered fates. Cooking and cleaning were heinous enough, but ironing clothes?

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"In Italy, style is a sport and the competition is steep.

During the workweek in Milan, where he and his team oversee brands like Cappellini, Cassina and Alias, the young mogul — and son of the Fiat and Ferrari chairman, Luca di Montezemolo — favors suits from a venerable Bolognese tailor. “I did my first suit with him at 18, and he knows every inch of my body,” di Montezemolo says.

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"Fashion and design may be two of Italy’s high-profile exports, but according to the new coffee-table tome “Italian Touch,” published this month by Skira and commissioned by the Italian luxury goods company Tod’s, style is less a business than a way of life. The editor Donatella Sartorio and the photographer Paolo Leone scoured the country, from Casa Degli Atellani in Milan (above left) to the Villa Rae in Naples (above right), in search of what the Tod’s president and chairman, Diego Della Valle, describes as “the character of contemporary Italian aristocracy: real people, involved and passionate about their work and dreams, who live both in great cities and the country, and who feel luxury as something innate.” The book captures a broad landscape, including blue bloods of fashion (the editor Anna Dello Russo; the public relations consultant Noona Smith-Petersen), design (the architect Benedetto Camerana; the interior decorator Alessia Bianchi Bormioli) and bona fide aristocracy (various princes from Tuscany and Sicily), shot in their natural habitats — a cast for whom all of the trappings of the good life fit as comfortably as, well, a pair of Tod’s fabled driving shoes. But if anyone truly embodies both the aspirations of the brand and the ambitions of the book it would be Della Valle. And where would he see himself in all of this? “My home in the Marche region of Italy — a 17th-century villa — would be the perfect setting,” he says without hesitation. “The home is very warm and welcoming — it would reveal that the important things for me are family, good friends and the simple things in life.” [?][?][?] ALIX BROWNE REMIX."
2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"Like most successful designers, Jil Sander built a brand on consistency. For 25 years, she projected a vision of clothes distilled to their essence, with nothing extraneous, their proportions perfectly calibrated. The message was right on pitch, never wavering. And though her public profile was modest and discreet, well away from the fashion circuit’s celebrity fanfare, we felt that we knew who she was and what she stood for, and the women who wore her clothes were fiercely loyal, as if she were their friend. Which, in a way, she was."
2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"The quintessential British vacation customarily involves renting something quaint. “In the U.K., a little cottage is usually your only option,” says Mark Robinson, the director of Living Architecture (living-architecture.co.uk), which has commissioned five new twists on the holiday house from cutting-edge architects like Peter Zumthor, Michael and Patty Hopkins, and the Dutch firm MVRDV. “Most people only experience new architecture in places like airports,” he added. The hope of a program like this is that it will inspire the kind of debate encouraged by Alain de Botton, the author of “The Architecture of Happiness” and an adviser to the project. The first four houses, including MVRDV’s glass-floored, cantilevered Balancing Barn (right), will be available in spring 2010. [?][?][?] WILLIAM SHAW."

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"Two years ago, the Dutch designer Tord Boontje visited the lace archives at the Design Center at Philadelphia University and emerged with reams of ideas, including one for a giant, black spider-web-like couch that he wove from thick sailing rope and suspended inside a giant metal frame. The archives also inspired the Canadian designer Cal Lane’s 600-pound laser-cut oil drum and the Dutch studio Demakersvan’s lace chain-link fence (left), now installed on the center’s grounds as part of “Lace in Translation,” which opened at the Design Center last month. “We’ve lost touch with making things ourselves,” says Boontje, who taught himself to tat using the grass growing outside his studio. “And I’ve always liked working with no-value materials. The value is all in the time you put into it.” How much time went into his couch? He laughs. “We had many people working,” he says after a pause, “for way too many hours.” In other words, priceless.

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"I’ve never been much for strapping on a tool belt, but on a drizzly summer morning not long ago, I fell in with a crew of about 10 men and women as they began their day’s work at a job site in Warren, Vt. They were constructing a sturdy, purposeful and deluxe outbuilding, the kind that seems to have replaced those follies of old — fake ruins, whimsical garden sheds — as a must-have country-house accessory. In this case, the project was a music-rehearsal studio and hangout meant to be an escape pod for the kids and an alternative to Excedrin for the parents. To be constructed out of a smorgasbord of raw ingredients and arcane building techniques, it was the architectural equivalent of a macrobiotic diet: straw bales, timber framing and wattle-and-daub walls (more or less sticks and mud). While I was directed to de-leaf willow branches (the wattles) and arrange them into usable piles according to size, my fellow workers poured gobs of clay and straw into wheelbarrows or revved up powerful Hole-Hawg drills. They seemed absolutely sure of their every step, like a guild of rugged journeymen. They were, in fact, students — a mix of aspiring or actual architects and builders — barely two-thirds of the way through a 12-week crash course in natural building offered by the nearby Yestermorrow Design/Build School."
2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"Fernando and Humberto Campana are iconoclasts at heart: their fruit bowl for the French porcelain company Bernardaud was a mass of disembodied baby-doll limbs. Still, when Lacoste approached them to create limited-edition polos for its fourth annual holiday series, the São Paulo duo was wary. “It’s like asking someone to change the Coca-Cola bottle,” says Fernando of messing with the company’s preppy bloodline. But their four polos do just that: one features Lacoste’s embroidered crocodile logos piled upon one another, as crocs do in their natural habitats; another gathers the logos in discrete clusters meant to mimic an Amazonian archipelago; and a third stitches dozens of logos together to form a reptilian bit of Brazilian lace. The Campanas aren’t the only design stars dabbling in fashion this fall: in October the Scottish label Ballantyne will introduce a supertechnical, water-resistant cashmere line by Philippe Starck. The French designer has sniffed at calling his creations fashion, but what else to call a collection of tailored pullovers, body-con shifts and hooded coats with details like detachable waistcoats and silk linings? Cozy, perhaps. [?][?][?] JILL SINGER."
2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"Permanence is not Urs Fischer’s game. In recent years, the Swiss-born artist has built a full-scale chalet from crumbling loaves of crusty bread, placed a collapsing brick wall on a pile of rotting vegetables and produced life-size female nudes as burning candles. Gaping holes loom just as large. In 2007, for example, he jackhammered a yawning, dirt-filled crater into the floor of his Manhattan gallery (above). For his first solo American museum show, opening Oct. 28 at the New Museum, Fischer has constructed a hallucinatory labyrinth of mirrored boxes based on a Manhattan streetscape, imprinting them with hundreds of images of familiar sights. With the addition of massive cast-aluminum sculptures that suggest human torsos, the building-wide “introspective,” says the curator Massimiliano Gioni, “is like taking a walk through Fischer’s mind.” Or perhaps like seeing in the dark.

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"“David Hicks: A Life of Design” (Rizzoli) is a lavish illustrated survey of the renowned British decorator’s work by his son, Ashley Hicks, who is himself a designer. It’s a nice follow-up to “David Hicks: Designer,” Ashley’s 2002 biography of his talented and charming but mercurial father. The new book emphasizes decorating — and, at $65, offers a comprehensive and more affordable alternative to the increasingly expensive, out-of-print books that Hicks produced in the ’60s and ’70s. There’s still plenty of dish on Hicks’s glamorous life and times, but also lots of big photographs of the houses and apartments that he designed for himself and clients like Vidal Sassoon and Helena Rubinstein. Also included is a selection of his vivid drawings and watercolors, including a colorful rendering of the antiquities in Sir John Soane’s Museum in London, one of Hicks’s favorite spots.

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"It was a delightful sight: thousands of teenagers dressed in the style of their favorite Japanese animated cartoon characters. They were converging on the Javits Center for the New York Anime Festival, a three-day event that began Sept. 25 and resembled Sundays in the Harajuku district of Tokyo, where inventive teenagers have showcased their garb for the last 15 years. It's part of a phenomenon called cosplay (short for costume play), and it's now a New York happening. But this is no Halloween parade: These clothes are often exquisitely put together, color coordinated and inspired in many instances by the mini crins and rocking-horse platform shoes of the British designer Vivienne Westwood, circa 1985. There were elegant gothic Lolitas, cafe waitresses and clogs that defied gravity. Headgear ranged from tiny top hats to a teacup balanced precariously on the side of a young woman's head."

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"Brett Favre is as polarizing as any political figure. Ninety percent of the opinions about him are formed long before he takes the field, and he inspires a din in the sports media that makes buzzing fluorescent lights sound soothing. The need for consensus between Favre's boosters and his bashers is urgent as the hype of his first game against Green Bay (2-1) reaches jackhammer decibels. To move past the rancor, Favre's fiercest critics must acknowledge that he has done all he has been asked to do this season by Minnesota (3-0), and a little more. And Favre's cheerleaders must concede that he has not been asked to do much. Aaron Rodgers inherited Favre's job and some of his traits, but none of his charismatic invulnerability. Rodgers is a risk taker, and many of his statistics this season (714 yards, 7.9 yards per attempt) are superior to Favre's (566 and 6.0, though Favre's completion percentage is higher, 65 percent to 57 percent). Rodgers is prone to sacks and safeties (he has had three career safeties, including two in one game against the Vikings last year), but while Favre made his frequent no-look interceptions seem rakish, Rodgers's mistakes look like symptoms of a post-Favre stress disorder. A victory at the Metrodome would silence Rodgers's doubters, who blame last year's 6-10 record on one of the few Packers who exceeded expectations."

''We get over 2,500 pairs a year, and we keep the prices cheap.'' And how. Prompted by the success of their first New York pop-up shop last spring (''We made more money in four days than we did in our first year of business,'' Mr. Garkinos admitted), the owners have opened a second iteration, which runs from Oct. 1 to 4 and which will feature, on the final day, shoes from the likes of Balenciaga, Azzedine Alaïa, Lanvin and Louboutin for $150 or less. Special clothing pieces (think Prada coats, Marni dresses) have also been reserved for the last day, when they will be sold for up to 80 percent off their original prices. ''I know,'' Mr. Garkinos said. ''It's a little out of control.''"

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"WHEN it comes to hotels, the Frugal Traveler asks for relatively little. A reasonable rate, of course, followed by clean sheets, some natural light and a bathroom, either private or shared, that functions as it's supposed to, most of the time. Atmosphere, history, floor space, breakfast -- these I can live without for a night or three. Which is why places like the Victorian Hotel, in the center of downtown Vancouver (514 Homer Street: 604-681-6369; www.victorianhotel.ca), make me so happy. Built as a guesthouse in 1898, it's still taking in wanderers more than a century later, and in classic style."

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"PARKER--William, died of cardiac arrest at home in Honolulu, HI, on September 25th. He was born in the Bronx in 1924. Bill graduated in the class of 1941 from William Penn Senior High School in York, Pennsylvania, where he met his wife of 62 years, Betty V. Davis, class of 1943, when they both were staff members of the York High Weekly. He graduated from New York University with a degree in business. Bill studied Japanese at the Army Language Schools in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, between 1942 and 1944, and subsequently served in the Allied Translator & Interpreter Service in Tokyo from 1945 through 1950 as part of the U.S. Occupation of Japan. He was to spend the majority of his life in Southeast Asia, working for pharmaceutical and chemical companies including Lederle, Mallinkrodt, and Sterling Pharmaceutical. He became a specialist in the facilitation of joint venture operations between Japanese and American companies. After his official retirement he continued to work as a consultant for diverse clients until shortly before his death. He enjoyed reading, walking, doing crossword puzzles in pen, and most recently, increasing his Hawaiian vocabulary. In 2008, he and Betty moved to Hawaii, where they entered the Kahala Nui Retirement Community. He is survived by his wife, Betty, their daughter, Alice McGowan of the Bronx, her husband, Brian McGowan, and two granddaughters, Leah and Emma. The family will hold a commemorative event at a later date. All his life, Bill appreciated fine music. Contributions can be made in his memory to The Honolulu Symphony, Development Director, 650 Iwilei Road, Suite 202, Honolulu, HI 96817, or The Kahala Nui Associates Fund, 4389 Malia Street, Honolulu, HI 96821."

Afghans want lasting security, and they want it to have an Afghan face. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top American commander there, wisely wants to double the size of the Afghan Army and increase the police forces to 160,000 men. This requires not just money, but also a commitment to send more trainers, embedded advisers and partner units. At the moment, international forces in Afghanistan say they still lack about 30 percent of the trainers and mentors needed to train even the current police force."

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"C OUNTERINSURGENCY is only as good as the government it supports. NATO could do everything right -- it isn't -- but will still fail unless Afghans trust their government. Without essential reform, merely making the government more efficient or extending its reach will just make things worse. Only a legitimately elected Afghan president can enact reforms, so at the very least we need to see a genuine run-off election or an emergency national council, called a loya jirga, before winter. Once a legitimate president emerges, we need to see immediate action from him on a publicly announced reform program, developed in consultation with Afghan society and enforced by international monitors. Reforms should include firing human rights abusers and drug traffickers, establishing an independent authority to investigate citizen complaints and requiring officials to live in the districts they are responsible for (fewer than half do)."

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"Stefanie Rinza, 44, has helped find homes for about 40 abandoned animals -- including a feral chow she coaxed into custody with a sandwich on Randalls Island; an edible pigeon, Boris, who had escaped from a chef; and a domesticated bunny hiding under a Range Rover on Madison Avenue. The day after she found the rabbit, a stranger stopped her in front of a Starbucks to ask where she might buy one. ''What are the odds of being asked for a rabbit when you are standing there with your espresso macchiato, innocently, after you've just found a rabbit?'' Ms. Rinza wondered. Another time, in a supermarket, a priest asked her if she could find him a stray black cat. ''I'm looking for something to go with my habit,'' he said. Two days later, one turned up in the trunk of a drunken driver's car. Last week she rescued a white chicken, which is staying at the former Vanderbilt mansion where she is a partner in Carlton Hobbs antiques. A native of West Germany, Ms. Rinza came to New York after 22 years in London. She lives on the Upper East Side with Alan Eskenazi, a retired police sergeant, and their 2-year-old son, Crockett."

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"WHILE in Afghanistan last summer as part of Gen. Stanley McChrystal's initial assessment team, I found many American and other international units more focused on protecting themselves than protecting the Afghan population. Traveling through the allegedly secure city of Mazar-i-Sharif with a German unit, for example, was like touring Afghanistan by submarine. What little I saw of the city was through a small slit of bulletproof glass in an armored personnel carrier. (While I was a light-infantry officer in both the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, I had never before traveled in an armored personnel carrier.) The Germans offered their assessment of security in the region, but since they lack regular face-to-face contact with the people living there, why should I trust their analysis? Can they speak with authority on the degree to which an insurgent campaign of intimidation is having an effect when they themselves keep the Afghans at such a distance? It's not just the Germans, though. Some American and other allied commanders also insist on protective measures that hamper troops from interacting with the population and gathering information on what is driving the conflict at the local level."
2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"SHAWN JOSWICK had no real intention of starting a jeans line. For the last couple of years, Mr. Joswick, a Brooklyn resident, has been in the denim-repair business, artfully patching worn-out bluejeans with bandannas and seersucker for vintage stores like Stock and Eleven and for anyone lucky enough to get hold of his phone number. And when deconstructed denim was big last year, he became the go-to guy to have your pants perfectly shredded. ''I thought about starting my own line, but I'm not a patternmaker,'' he said. ''And the market is already so saturated.'' But, motivated by the positive response to his work, he began buying vintage Levi's and reworking them for hours, occasionally days, until they took on the faded, patchworked patina of a favorite pair of jeans. Chloë Sevigny became a fan; Barneys bought them up. In July, the store began selling his men's styles. Just recently, it added his women's jeans (left) to their designer collections, which Mr. Joswick couldn't be happier about."
2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"WITHIN a year, we must persuade large numbers of insurgents to lay down their arms or switch to the government's side. Afghanistan's doughty warriors have a tradition of changing alliances, but success will require both military operations focused on the insurgent leadership and, even more important, incentives for fighters at the local level. Mid-level insurgents and their followers should be offered a chance to join a revised version of the Afghan Public Protection Force. These local self-defense forces should be expanded and tied to legitimate local governing structures -- both official and tribal. The majority of development funds should be funneled to leaders to strengthen local governance and development and pay the militias' salaries."

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"B Y and large, my generation of military professionals trained for and thought about what we might call ''Type A'' war -- modern war, featuring the clash of mechanized forces fielded by industrial states. Happily, we never had to fight the Soviets on the northern German plain, though Operation Desert Storm showed we might have been pretty good at it, had the balloon gone up. In Afghanistan we're fighting a ''Type B'' war that is in some of its essentials ''postmodern.'' Like postmodernism itself, the concept has a variety of meanings and may not represent a coherent set of ideas. But one thing is clear: the Type B enemy likely has little to lose -- no territory to protect, few important targets at risk, perhaps even no life worth living. Thus the Type A objective of fatally weakening an opponent by destroying assets important to his success -- in theory, a measurable process -- is replaced in Type B war by the much more complicated, essentially unquantifiable task of defeating him."

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"S KEPTICS of state-building proposals question whether the Kabul government -- now almost fully dependent on foreign aid -- will ever be able to support the military and police forces being trained. Yet there has been comparatively little investment by the international community in helping Kabul collect taxes, even though insurgents and corrupt officials have proved it can be done. In addition to collecting taxes from the illegal opium trade, Taliban forces extort money from trucks carrying legal cargo through their territories and demand ''protection fees'' from local businesses, even hitting up construction projects financed by NATO."

In 1999 the artist and blogger Andrew Kuo was a 21-year-old music obsessive who kept a record of every album he bought and every show he saw. (He still does.) Below he charts the way his experience of acquiring and enjoying music has changed along with the advent of iPods, MP3 blogs, iTunes, MySpace, streaming, RapidShare and Twitter. ''I enjoy music more than ever, and I spend more time on it than ever, but I'm not participating in it in the same way in that I'm spending a lot less money,'' he said. ''When I hear that an album leaks, I want to hear it right away. Instead of finding information one step at a time, one record at a time, now it seems like the information finds you, from multiple and seemingly endless sources.''"

There are Jeff Koons porcelain puppy vases; Marc Newson marble tables and chairs; prints by Ed Ruscha and Damien Hirst; and an assortment of artist books, including Richard Prince's ''Bettie Kline,'' a leather-bound publication that juxtaposes photos of Bettie Page with paintings by Franz Kline.

But that is what Brian Roberts did on Sept. 9 when he hit his 50th double of the season, becoming the fourth player to record three 50-double seasons in a career. At 56 doubles, he has a slight chance of becoming the first player since 1936 to reach 60 doubles. Even if Roberts does not reach 60 doubles, he made baseball history on Sept. 29 by hitting his 56th double of the season, which broke Lance Berkman's record for doubles by a switch-hitter, set in 2001."

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"A MERICA cannot achieve even the minimal objective of preventing Al Qaeda from re-establishing safe havens in Afghanistan without a substantial increase in forces over the coming year. The Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan's south is growing. The Afghan and international forces there now cannot reverse that growth. They may not even be able to stem it. That is the assessment of the top American commander there, Gen. Stanley McChrystal. President Obama said in August, ''If left unchecked, the Taliban insurgency will mean an even larger safe haven from which Al Qaeda would plot to kill more Americans.'' Some of his advisers now say the opposite: Taliban control will not lead to terrorist havens. Why not? Osama bin Laden first built camps in the territory of a Taliban leader, Jalaluddin Haqqani, in the mid-1980s. Relations between Al Qaeda and the Taliban remain close. Even if they do not invite Al Qaeda in, could they, unlike Pakistan, keep Al Qaeda out? The president was right: the triumph of the Taliban will benefit Al Qaeda."

It was over 50 years ago that Bill got the idea of bringing together a group of young men who had come to New York to build their careers. The ""rules"" were simple: we would meet once a month (often with accomplished guests); there would be no more than two from each profession or calling; we would tell one another about our work and our lives; we would teach one another about the world as we saw it and the opportunities it presented. From that humble beginning sprang a group who continued to meet together, though less frequently, right up to today. It bred lifelong friendships, much learning of the ways of the world and produced a host of successful people. Now, over 50 years later, we have lost the man who conceived the idea, brought us together and continued to lead us in the ways of friendship, knowledge and success. We will miss Bill Safire profoundly. We will miss his erudition, his wit and his teaching. The best thing we can do in his memory is to seek to keep our group going until, over time, we all join Bill in his new venue where we are sure the table will be laid and he will be waiting for us with his wry smile.

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"TO defeat the insurgency, the Afghan government and its main partner, the United States, need to win the confidence of the public. Accountability must replace the widespread immunity enjoyed by officials who abuse their power. Despite all the problems with our recent election, the incoming government will have a chance to start fresh, and a proper vetting of all new officials is the place to begin. This means establishing strict accountability mechanisms for high officials in the districts and provinces as well as in the ministries and directorates in Kabul. Simply shuffling abusive and incompetent officials among offices -- as has been the norm over the past eight years -- keeps the public from getting the governmental services it needs."

I imagine this as a place of shadows, where your heart beats fast, you are listening and alert, and forever glancing over your shoulder. In places where predators roam, the landscape of fear is as real as the physical landscape. But rather than being made of mountains and valleys, forests and grasslands, it's smells, sounds and adrenaline. Some time ago, I saw a clear example of how predators can change things. A friend of mine had a fish tank containing one big fish (about a foot long) and seven or eight much smaller fish (each about an inch). The small fish always went around together, in a tight school. Then, one day, after a long and pampered existence, the big fish died. As soon as his body was taken out of the tank, the little fish stopped schooling. You could almost hear them gurgling with relief."

2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"Lucy, you sweet young thing. No longer can you lay claim to being the oldest creature on the human branch of the primate family tree. The honor goes to Ardi, who at 4.4 million years old has you beat by a little over a million. Her assembled bones were unveiled Thursday by scientists who had been analyzing the Ardipithecus specimen since fragments were found in Ethiopia in 1992. The particulars: Taller and heavier than Lucy, she weighed about 120 pounds and stood four feet tall (yes, she probably walked upright, though she was still an agile tree-climber). Forget the high heels; her feet had no arches (Lucy's did). Tim D. White of Berkeley, a leader of the study team, said, ''We are getting so close to that common ancestor of hominids and chimps, and we'd love to find an earlier skeleton.''"
2009-10-04T00:00:00Z,"KELLY--Richard J. (Dick). May 4, 1934 September 26, 2009. Born in Yonkers, NY. Dick attended Jamaica High School in Queens, NY. He was a graduate of CUNY Queens College earning a B.S. degree in Accounting and Economics. Dick earned his Certified Public Accountant (CPA) license and was the youngest professional to be named Partner at KPMG (Hurdman and Cran-ston at the time). Dick rose to become managing partner of the KPMG Stamford, CT office. After retirement at age 55 he was recruited by KPMG to be managing partner again, but this time for a start-up office in St. Maarten. After just 18 months the office had established itself on the island and Dick was told ""you did such a good job building this practice we don't need you anymore."" He then joined the Rotary Club and started his own practice for 4++ years along with a senior partner. Dick was also a prolific writer. He authored ""The Advertising Budget,"" a standard reference work of The Association of National Advertisers which was translated into four languages and was an international business book best seller. Dick served as a consulting editor for the national accounting magazines ""CPA"" and ""The Journal of Accountancy."" He was a member of several professional and social organizations including a founding member of The Wild Geese, an organization that promotes Irish American heritage. While living in Croton-on-Hudson, NY, he was very active in community affairs. He became a Village Trustee, member of the Croton Council Knights of Columbus, parishioner of Holy Name of Mary Church, was an umpire, coach and six-year member of the Croton Little League Board of Directors. But it was his position as Little League sports columnist of the two local newspapers he was most proud. For three years he wrote a weekly newspaper column on Little League happenings in Croton. ""There's one thing I'm quite proud of in writing those columns,"" he said. ""Every year by using a little imagination, I was able to work in the name of every player in the league. It really meant something for those kids to see their names in print."" His main interests were his extended family, friends, The Brooklyn Dodgers (and subsequently NY Mets), golf, reading, particularly history and politics, crossword puzzles, traveling and organic gardening. He is predeceased by a brother and a sister. He is survived by Elaine, his wife of 53 years, his oldest son Richard and wife Nancy, his second son Christopher, three grandchildren Megan, Laura, Brendan, a brother Ed and sisters Jeanne and Peggy. There will be a small private service and the family will receive friends at a later date."

''The whales were so powerful and big. I felt lucky to see them. There's a wideness to Tierra del Fuego; it's just wide open. To get around, I hitchhiked -- I don't do it in Switzerland, but in Patagonia, I wasn't afraid -- and I took the bus. During one bus trip to Puerto Natales, I met an old man, about 75 to 80 years old. He was impressed that I'd come from so far away. He invited me to come to his home. His wife is dead. His son and daughter live with him, and they have sheep, and many children. His daughter cooked for me. I stayed there for two days. They were worried for me because they weren't used to a woman traveling alone. They wanted to accompany me all the time. Near their house, they showed me a condor's home in a rock, and we watched small condors learning to fly. The people in Patagonia have a lot of heart, and a great sense of humor.'' As told to Hilary Howard"

Visitors to the Louvre in Paris soon won’t have to travel far to enjoy the works of Leonardo, Delacroix and Géricault after dining on Le Big Mac: a McDonald’s restaurant and McCafé are planned to open near the Louvre in November, The Telegraph of London reported. Though the fast-food establishments will be in the underground shopping area below the museum, called the Carrousel du Louvre, and not the Louvre itself, the impending opening is already causing indigestion among some art aficionados. “I’m not against eating in a museum but McDonald’s is hardly the height of gastronomy,” Didier Rykner, the editor of the Web site, The Art Tribune, told The Telegraph, adding: “Today McDonald’s, tomorrow low-cost clothes shops.” In a statement, the Louvre said that it welcomed the fact that its visitors, “French or foreign,” will be able to enjoy “a rich and varied” selection of restaurants. Last year, Louvre employees and art admirers sent the museum a petition to protest a Starbucks planned near the museum, but were unable to stop the coffee shop from opening."

2009-10-05T11:36:19Z,"Show business, take note: there just might be increased demand for horror offerings in the weeks leading up to Halloween. Paramount has become the latest movie studio to stumble onto this truism with the limited release of its micro-budget film “Paranormal Activity,” whose midnight screenings have proved so successful that the company said it was expanding the film’s showings at theaters this weekend. In the spirit of inexpensive thrillers like “The Blair Witch Project,” “Paranormal Activity,” purports to be the found footage recorded by a man and a woman who hear inexplicable noises in their San Diego home. The film, written and directed by Oren Peli and made for a cost of about $10,000, was released on Sept. 25 with midnight-only screenings in 13 college towns. It later expanded to 20 metropolitan areas (including New York) after audiences voted to request the film on the Web site eventful.com. Over the weekend, Paramount said that “Paranormal Activity” sold out all of its midnight screenings in 33 cities, earning $535,000 in ticket sales or about $16,000 per screen. Starting Friday, the studio said, it will expand the film to 40 markets where it will be shown at all hours."

For the eight-episode series, called “Gone Too Far,” young addicts were recorded in meetings with DJ AM and their families and friends as they discuss their substance abuse problems and seek treatment. DJ AM, whose given name was Adam Goldstein, was found dead in his Manhattan apartment on Aug. 28.

He added that he had expressed concerns about “the sluggishness of the work” after visiting the construction site. The 185-year-old theater, home to both the Bolshoi Ballet and Bolshoi Opera, closed in July 2005 to undergo renovations that were supposed to be completed by 2008, but are now not likely to be finished until at least 2011.

''That would have been naïve, to have a scent of birch,'' says Ville Kokkonen, Artek's head of design, who explained that ''bottling the scent of chairs'' just wouldn't make sense. (Tell that to Herzog & de Meuron, whose 2005 perfume Rotterdam smells like hashish and Rhine water.) Instead, Artek's result, Standard eau de toilette, evokes the brand through a more subtle blend of linnea borealis flowers, Finnish labrador tea and metal - nature meets machine, as in the classic bentwood chairs for which the company is known. Standard is a major departure for Artek, which is looking to branch out to other cultural platforms; hence the splashy appearance at this summer's Venice Biennale. But in general, perfumes by designers and architects aren't quite the rarity they once were: In addition to Herzog & de Meuron, the Japanese architecture firm Sanaa recently released the limited-edition scent Translucence for the New Museum in New York, channeling the lightness of its buildings in notes of musk, freesia and apple."

And add instruments and backup vocals here and there to the band's bare-bones sound: Hannah Blilie on drums, Brace Paine on guitar or bass and Beth Ditto on vocals. And voilà -- indie-rock barnstormers are pop contenders."

Spurred by the news that the naturalist Alfred Wallace was preparing to make public his own theory of natural selection, Darwin must finally confront the fact that publishing “On the Origin of Species” may, in the eyes of the church, put his soul on the express elevator to hell. In the dramatization “Darwin’s Darkest Hour,” Henry Ian Cusick plays the scientist and Frances O’Connor plays Emma, his wife."
2009-10-06T10:41:25Z,"Among the risks of waiting nearly two decades between your album releases is that many more artists can spring up in that time to claim later that you’ve plagiarized their work. Guns N’ Roses discovered this when they were sued by Ulrich Schnauss, a German electronic musician who says that the band sampled two of his songs without his permission, The Guardian reported. Lawyers for Mr. Schnauss’s American and British record labels say in the suit that Guns N’ Roses, on its 2008 release “Chinese Democracy,” illegally used portions of Mr. Schnauss’s songs “Wherever You Are” (from 2001) and “A Strangely Isolated Place” (from 2003) on a track called “Riad N’ the Bedouins.” The suit asks for compensation of at least $1 million and for Geffen Records to halt release of “Chinese Democracy”; that album, the first studio release from Guns N’ Roses since 1993, has sold more than 3.2 million copies worldwide. The band’s lead singer, Axl Rose, and Geffen Records did not immediately comment on the suit."
2009-10-06T11:32:32Z,"If you haven’t been able to nab tickets for the coming Michael Jackson documentary “This Is It,” for which some preview screenings have already sold out, you could always try seeing it in China. An executive for Sony Pictures told The Associated Press that the Chinese government had approved “This Is It” to be shown in that country later this month, in time for the film’s planned two-week worldwide release beginning on Oct. 28. China allows only 20 foreign films to be shown on its screens each year; among the American films that have already played there this year is “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,” which broke a Chinese box-office record set by another American film, “Titanic.” Sony Pictures told The A.P. that it would produce “as many prints as possible” of “This Is It,” which is compiled from footage of the concert tour that Mr. Jackson was rehearsing when he died in June."

Russell‘s 1999 film about the Gulf War “Three Kings,” which was released, Mr. Scott says, “at a high point of America’s pre-9/11 imperial ambivalence.” The tone of the film shifts between slapstick comedy and grotesque violence and asks whether or not America as a superpower is motivated by greed or generosity."
2009-10-06T12:15:28Z,"More than 150 years later, Edgar Allan Poe will finally receive a proper funeral — two of them, in fact. The city of Baltimore is planning two ceremonial burials for Poe, the author and postmodern fashion plate, to recognize the 200th anniversary of his birth, The Associated Press reported. The events offer more than just a good afternoon’s entertainment for local goths: they are meant to make up for the fact that when Poe died in 1849, his funeral was attended by fewer than 10 people. (His cousin Neilson Poe never publicly announced his death.) To accommodate the expected turnout, two funerals will be held on Sunday at Westminster Hall, the former church near his family plot in Westminster Graveyard. If those events are not sufficiently gloomy for you, they will be preceded on Wednesday by a public viewing of a replica of Poe’s body, and on Thursday by an all-night vigil at the Poe Monument in Westminster Graveyard. (The official florist for the Poe funerals can be found here.)"

In the spirit of inexpensive thrillers like &#8220;The Blair Witch Project,&#8221; &#8220;Paranormal Activity&#8221; is presented as found footage recorded by a man and a woman who hear inexplicable noises in their San Diego home. The film, written and directed by Oren Peli and made for about $10,000, was released on Sept. 25 with midnight-only screenings in 13 college towns. It later expanded to 20 metropolitan areas (including New York) after audiences voted for the film on the Web site eventful.com. Over the weekend, Paramount said, &#8220;Paranormal Activity&#8221; sold out all its midnight screenings in 33 cities, earning $535,000 in ticket sales, or about $16,000 per screen. Starting Friday, the studio said, it will expand the film to 40 markets in which it will be shown at all hours."

A spokesman for Local 1, Bruce Cohen, had no further comment except to say that the union &#8220;expects a satisfactory resolution.&#8221;."

Born in New York City on September 19, 1921, she attended the Julia Richman High School and Hunter College. During World War II, she worked for the USO, interviewing servicemen for the military upon their return from the front. Mrs. Sommer lived in the New York metropolitan area for almost all of her life, and with Sigmund, ran one of the most successful thoroughbred racing stables of its time, during the 1960s and 70s. With Frank Martin as trainer, they were leading money winners in North America for ten consecutive years. They owned Sham, who won the 1973 Santa Anita Derby, and who took second place in the Wood Memorial Stakes over Secretariat, who finished third. He placed in two of the three legs of the Triple Crown in the same year, when Secretariat won the three races. In the Kentucky Derby, Sham placed second to Secretariat, yet still broke the track record after stumbling in the gate. Even after Sigmund Sommer's death, Viola Sommer remained active in the company he founded, Sigmund Sommer Properties. She also distinguished herself by winning the Eclipse Award for outstanding owner in 1982, and serving as a trustee with the New York Racing Association (NYRA) and the Jockey Club for many years. She is survived by her older brother Eugene, 94, her 3 children, Jack Sommer, Susan Sommer Schweitzman, and Dr. Barbara Sommer Fisher, and by 10 grandchildren.

L.S.U. got the ball in good field position and scored with 46 seconds left to win, 20-13. Redding said the back judge made the call and wrote in a postgame report that Green called attention to himself after his touchdown with a gesture toward the crowd.

2009-10-07T16:48:25Z,"PARIS - A couple of days ago a friend was saying, and not without reason, that while this season had produced beautiful clothes, it had also lacked real energy. Yesterday, two collections went a long way to counter that. At Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld put on a masterful spectacle backed up with light, wearable luxury. He created a farmhouse in the middle of Paris, reminiscent of Marie Antoinette's Petit Trianon; coquettish country courtesans wearing peppy tailleurs in earthy shades, logo clogs, hemp bags, dirndls and naughty aprons rose from a giant haystack in the middle of the setup. The clothes were certainly enough to hold the audience's attention, but toward the end of the show the singer Lily Allen emerged from the ground and performed one song in a rustic stage decorated with flowers. As if this wasn't enough, Lagerfeld's models of the moment - Lara Stone, Freja Beja Erichsen and Baptiste Giabiconi - wrapped things up with a roll in the hay. Who says fashion isn't fun anymore?"

There are scores and scores of chairs - occasional chairs, Grotto chairs, slipper chairs, easy chairs, Adirondack chairs and campaign chairs - most stripped down to the frame, waiting for some posh upholsterer from Great Neck to affix the passementerie. All this had been stored in a Long Island City warehouse, where the auction's coordinator, Tiffany Dubin, and staff spent the summer combing through a 60-year career."

2009-10-07T00:00:00Z,"Because of an editing error, an obituary on Friday about Mahlon Hoagland, whose research helped explain how DNA is translated into the proteins that carry out its coded message, misstated his date of death. It was Sept. 18, not “last Friday” (Sept. 25). The obituary also referred incorrectly to the role of James Watson and Francis Crick in earlier DNA research. They discovered the structure of DNA — not DNA itself, which was first identified in 1869, by Johann Friedrich Miescher."
2009-10-07T00:00:00Z,"A film review on Friday about the Ricky Gervais movie “The Invention of Lying” referred incorrectly to Oscar Wilde, whose reference to “dreary realism” was likened to Mr. Gervais’s view. He was Irish, not British."

He did not give an acceptance speech via satellite."
2009-10-07T00:00:00Z,"A Sports of The Times column on Sunday, about the role that the New York Giants and the Polo Grounds played in shaping the Mets, referred incorrectly to the ownership of the property on which the Polo Grounds was eventually built. The property, which became known as Coogan’s Bluff and Hollow, was inherited by Harriet G. Coogan; it was not farmland that belonged to her husband, James J. Coogan. The column also erroneously attributed a distinction to Mr. Coogan. He was the second Manhattan borough president, not the first. (Augustus W. Peters was the first.)."

Alumina is a chemical compound used in the smelting of aluminum metal and in a broad range of advanced ceramic products.

Baltimore is planning two ceremonial burials for Poe, the author and postmodern fashion plate, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of his birth, The Associated Press reported. The events offer more than just a good afternoon’s entertainment for goths: they are meant to make up for the fact that when Poe died in 1849, his funeral was attended by fewer than 10 people. (His cousin Neilson Poe never publicly announced his death.) To accommodate the expected turnout of hundreds of people, two funerals will be held on Sunday at Westminster Hall, the former church near his burial site in Westminster graveyard. Those events will be preceded on Wednesday by a public viewing of an effigy of Poe’s body, and on Thursday by an all-night vigil at the Poe Monument in Westminster graveyard."
2009-10-07T00:00:00Z,"Among the risks of waiting almost two decades between album releases is that many more artists can spring up in that time to claim that you&#8217;ve plagiarized their work. Guns N&#8217; Roses learned this when it was sued by Ulrich Schnauss, a German electronic musician who says the band sampled two of his songs without his permission, The Guardian of London reported. Lawyers for Mr. Schnauss&#8217;s American and British record labels say in the suit that Guns N&#8217; Roses, on its 2008 release, &#8220;Chinese Democracy,&#8221; illegally used portions of Mr. Schnauss&#8217;s songs &#8220;Wherever You Are&#8221; (from 2001) and &#8220;A Strangely Isolated Place&#8221; (from 2003) on the track &#8220;Riad N&#8217; the Bedouins.&#8221; The suit requests compensation of at least $1 million and for Geffen Records, which put out &#8220;Chinese Democracy,&#8221; to halt its release. That album, the first new studio release from Guns N&#8217; Roses since 1993, has sold more than 3.2 million copies worldwide. The band&#8217;s lead singer, Axl Rose, and Geffen Records did not immediately comment on the suit."

In a statement on Tuesday Nicole Roberts said: &#8220;My father is feeling great and looks forward to returning to the show. He experienced a minor seizure and regrets that it had to happen so publicly. He is taking medication now, which should prevent any further incidents.&#8221; Mr. Roberts, 69, fell ill during a matinee of &#8220;The Royal Family,&#8221; a 1927 comedy by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, and that performance was canceled. The Manhattan Theater Club, which is presenting the play, said on Monday that the official opening, scheduled for Thursday at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, would still take place. No announcement was made about who would take over Mr. Roberts&#8217;s role for that performance; his understudy, Anthony Newfield, has been filling in for him. A spokesman for the play said its producers were taking it &#8220;day by day&#8221; in regards to Mr. Roberts&#8217;s return."
2009-10-07T00:00:00Z,"Havana&#8217;s loss is New York&#8217;s gain, sort of. The cancellation of the New York Philharmonic&#8217;s trip to Cuba planned for the end of this month created a hole in the orchestra&#8217;s schedule. On Tuesday the Philharmonic announced plans to fill it, choosing programs that do not require a lot of heavy lifting. On the evenings of Oct. 30 and Oct. 31 the orchestra will play Beethoven&#8217;s &#8220;Egmont&#8221; Overture and Piano Concerto No. 3, with Emanuel Ax as the soloist; Bernstein&#8217;s symphonic dances from &#8220;West Side Story&#8221;; and Falla&#8217;s Suite No. 2 from &#8220;The Three-Cornered Hat.&#8221; At a Saturday matinee performance, in place of the Bernstein and Falla pieces, Alan Gilbert, the orchestra&#8217;s new music director, will join members of the orchestra and Mr. Ax for a performance of Schumann&#8217;s Piano Quintet in E flat. Mr. Gilbert will play second violin. The move is not altogether surprising, as Mr. Gilbert&#8217;s father is a retired member of the violin section and his mother still plays in it."

2009-10-07T00:00:00Z,"The Swiss Justice Ministry has rejected Roman Polanski&#8217;s request that it reconsider his arrest, and has also recommended that a court decline his appeal for release from detention on bail. &#8220;The reason is that we still think there is a considerable risk that he will escape and that liberation on bail and other security measures can&#8217;t guarantee his presence in the extradition procedure,&#8221; Folco Galli, a Justice Ministry spokesman, said on Tuesday in a telephone interview. He added that he did not know when the court would rule on the matter. The Swiss police arrested Mr. Polanski on Sept. 26, and are holding him pending hearings on an application for his extradition to the United States, which he fled more than 30 years ago before being sentenced for having sex with a 13-year-old girl. Mr. Galli said the United States had not applied for Mr. Polanski&#8217;s extradition, but had 40 days to do so starting from the time of his arrest."

I started with a base of eggs (not surprising) and chose almonds, pulverized in the food processor, instead of flour; I was after flavor, not lightness. For a more interesting texture, I tossed in a handful of sliced almonds as well."

2009-10-07T00:00:00Z,"SOMMER--Viola Sommer nee Landsberg, wife of Sigmund Sommer, the well-known New York real estate developer and noted race horse owner, succumbed to a long illness after having just turned 88 with her three loving children and grandchildren at her side on Sunday, October 4, 2009. Born in New York City on September 19, 1921, she attended the Julia Richman High School and Hunter College. During World War II, she worked for the USO, interviewing servicemen for the military upon their return from the front. Mrs. Sommer lived in the New York metropolitan area for almost all of her life, and with Sigmund, ran one of the most successful thoroughbred racing stables of its time, during the 1960s and 70s. With Frank Martin as trainer, they were leading money winners in North America for ten consecutive years. They owned Sham, who won the 1973 Santa Anita Derby, and who took second place in the Wood Memorial Stakes over Secretariat, who finished third. He placed in two of the three legs of the Triple Crown in the same year, when Secretariat won the three races. In the Kentucky Derby, Sham placed second to Secretariat, yet still broke the track record after stumbling in the gate. Even after Sigmund Sommer's death, Viola Sommer remained active in the company he founded, Sigmund Sommer Properties. She also distinguished herself by winning the Eclipse Award for outstanding owner in 1982, and serving as a trustee with the New York Racing Association (NYRA) and the Jockey Club for many years. She is survived by her older brother Eugene, 94, her 3 children, Jack Sommer, Susan Sommer Schweitzman, and Dr. Barbara Sommer Fisher, and by 10 grandchildren. Mrs. Sommer's memorial service took place on Tuesday, October 6, 2009 at The Riverside Memorial Chapel. Memorial gifts may be made to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and sent to the Office of Development, 525 East 68 Street, Box 123, NYC 10065."

''At what point should we stop trying to prevent the inevitable? Is keeping someone alive for three more days worth the pain and suffering?'' wrote Jeff, a poster from Wyoming.

As part of a two-album deal with Walt Disney Records, Mr. Wilson will create new pieces of music based on unfinished Gershwin works, the record label said Thursday in a news release. The new compositions, which Disney said that Mr. Wilson would “Brian-ize with his trademark vocal stacks and unique arrangements,” will appear on an album that will also include Mr. Wilson’s covers of other classic songs by George and Ira Gershwin. The estates of both Gershwin siblings have given their approval for the project, which a representative for Mr. Wilson said he would begin recording with his band on Oct. 18 and finish after Thanksgiving.

2009-10-08T00:00:00Z,"The lengthy holdout of receiver Michael Crabtree ended early Wednesday, when he agreed to a deal with the San Francisco 49ers only hours before the Jets completed a trade for Braylon Edwards. Whether the two events are connected -- the Niners had accused the Jets of tampering with Crabtree during his holdout -- only a few Jets executives know. But with Crabtree finally in the fold, the Niners (3-1), who lead the National Football Conference West with a conservative offense, now have a game-breaking threat, that is, if he can learn the offense quickly. That may take awhile because Crabtree, the 10th overall pick in the 2009 N.F.L. draft, missed the team's minicamps and off-season organized activities while recovering from a foot injury. Then his holdout consumed all of training camp and the first month of the regular season. The holdout was based on his belief that he should be paid like the first receiver picked in the draft, Darrius Heyward-Bey, who was taken seventh over all and received $23.5 million guaranteed, rather than like a player at his slotted spot."

Majority Reid will put together a stronger bill, possibly (hopefully) with an employer mandate, along with an individual mandate maybe, and go forward. Although I am hopeful that a public option will be included, I think Reid may let the option come to the floor to be voted on.

On Wednesday, Egypt suspended its cooperation with the Louvre, saying that five fresco fragments in its collection were stolen from Luxor’s Valley of the Kings, and that the museum was not honoring a longstanding agreement to return any smuggled or stolen Egyptian artifacts. The French government had said the Louvre acted in good faith when it bought the relics in 2000 and 2003, but a commission that oversees the nation’s museums voted unanimously to return them, saying that significant doubts about their origins had been raised. In November, archaeologists rediscovered the tomb from which the relics seem to have come from, raising the question of whether they had been taken legally from Egypt."

Hours later, NBC’s surprise cancellation of “Southland” (which, technically, is a returning show and not a new series) threatened to upset that balance. But now ABC has cast three more votes in favor of promising new programs: The Hollywood Reporter said that the network has ordered full seasons of its comedies “Modern Family,” “Cougar Town” and “The Middle.” “Cougar Town,” which stars the “Friends” alumna Courteney Cox, and “Modern Family,” an ensemble series, drew strong ratings for their September premieres but have faded slightly in recent weeks; “The Middle,” which stars Patricia Heaton (of “Everybody Loves Raymond”), has averaged fewer than 7 million viewers a week. Ominously, ABC made no announcement about its new Kelsey Grammer sitcom “Hank,” which airs side-by-side with “The Middle,” or its new series “Eastwick,” adapted from “The Witches of Eastwick.”"

Inexplicably, the White House has allowed the business lobbies to define the new agency -- a bunch of power-hungry bureaucrats who want to impose onerous new regulations, etc., etc. -- which, in turn, has put Congressional Democrats on the defensive. The bill has already been watered down somewhat to make it more palatable to the community bankers who have so much sway in every Congressional district. It's time now to move the thing along."

The works were disarming because of the relaxed postures of his subjects - e.g., a naked Cary Grant leaning casually against a fireplace - but also a bit overwhelming given their larger-than-life size.

Distrito, a sister hotel to the tastemaker magnet Condesa df, is way out in the neighborhood of Santa Fe (imagine Wilshire Boulevard at the edge of nowhere), but that doesn't stop the city's pretty young things with ripped jeans and money to burn from crowding the poolside lounge. Amid a mostly black and white scheme, there's plenty of boxy furniture and kitschy design tricks of the sort that the Standard Hotels have been serving up for years. The St. Regis, on the other hand, is a glass behemoth by the Argentine-American starchitect César Pelli, where silver foxes in khakis come to drink highballs in a sea of tasteful neutrals. The most notable thing about the hotel just might be the service.

For his next album, Mr. Wilson, the former front man of the Beach Boys, will be collaborating with a pop star who preceded him by a generation or three: George Gershwin. As part of a two-album deal with Walt Disney Records, Mr. Wilson will create new pieces of music based on unfinished Gershwin works, the record label said Thursday. The new compositions, which Disney said Mr. Wilson would &#8220;Brian-ize with his trademark vocal stacks and unique arrangements,&#8221; are to appear on an album that will also include Mr. Wilson&#8217;s covers of other classic songs by George and Ira Gershwin. The estates of both Gershwin siblings have given their approval for the project, which a representative for Mr. Wilson said he would begin recording with his band on Oct. 18 and finish after Thanksgiving. In a statement, Mr. Wilson called the album &#8220;the most spiritual project I&#8217;ve ever worked on.&#8221;."

In a release, press representatives for “Love Never Dies” said that its world premiere would take place at the Adelphi Theater in London on March 9. Its Broadway opening is scheduled for Nov. 11, 2010, at a theater to be determined, followed by an Australian run in 2011. The London production is to star Ramin Karimloo (of London’s “Phantom” and “Les Misérables”) as the Phantom and Sierra Boggess (of Broadway’s “Little Mermaid”) as Christine. It will be directed by Jack O’Brien (“Hairspray,” “The Coast of Utopia”). Above from left, Mr. Lloyd Webber, Ms. Boggess and Mr. Karimloo."

2009-10-09T00:00:00Z,"Chekhov's ''Seagull'' is given a splash of cool absurdism in the National Asian American Theater Company's new version, and it's bracing. What can sometimes be presented as a glum panorama of bourgeois delusion and tragedy (Chekhov insisted, as this troupe does, that the play is a comedy) is here a lively production punctuated by touches of vaudeville and the grotesque. Of course Chekhov's densely populated classic has much to say about literature, fame and the vanities of show business, not to mention crossed romantic intentions among human beings. But sometimes the play's layers of frustration, betrayal and disillusionment could benefit from fresh air, and at the Theater for the New City they get it."

2009-10-09T00:00:00Z,"When a sensitive Iranian writer, Mahida (Roxanna Hope), meets a sweetly amiable American painter, Thomas (a charming James Wallert), on a pier in a small town in the United States, the conversation quickly turns metaphorical. ''I think about borders all the time,'' she says, inspired by a bench dividing the attractive couple. ''What is the boundary, I wonder, between what lasts and what does not?'' Depending on your tolerance for soulful ruminations, the musings of Russell Davis's ''Mahida's Extra Key to Heaven'' will make you scratch either your chin or your head. In a seamless staging by Will Pomerantz at the Peter Norton Space that papers over some of the script's problems, this play aims for a vague, enigmatic tone that is the enemy of specificity. It takes place in an unnamed town in the ''recent past'' and features sincere small talk like ''I'm just thinking about destiny.''"

2009-10-09T00:00:00Z,"When the calendar turns to October, baseball strategy changes in significant ways. While the previous six months are a grueling 162-game marathon, in which a team's depth and a manager's ability to keep his players rested are key, the postseason is a win-or-go-home sprint. For position players, this distinction is minimal; for pitchers, it is crucial. Because the fifth starter drops out of the rotation and the fourth misses his turn whenever possible, conventional wisdom emphasizes the importance of front-line starting pitching in the postseason. Be it Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, or Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling, it is widely thought that two bona fide aces can determine a best-of-seven series. As a result, many analysts had dismissed the Dodgers' postseason chances -- even though they finished with the National League's best record -- noting that they lack a one-two punch to match St. Louis's Chris Carpenter and Adam Wainwright or Philadelphia's Cole Hamels and Cliff Lee."

2009-10-09T00:00:00Z,"When Abraham Lincoln visited New York in February 1861, Walt Whitman noticed that an ''ominous silence'' greeted the president-elect as he arrived at the Astor House hotel. There was no overt hostility or shouted insult, Whitman wrote, but the ''silence of the crowd was very significant,'' compared with the ''wild, tumultuous hurrahs'' that typically greeted distinguished personages. Harold Holzer, the chief historian for the compellingly informative exhibition ''Lincoln and New York,'' opening on Friday at the New-York Historical Society, explains in the equally incisive companion catalog that when Lincoln attended a performance of Verdi's new opera ''Un Ballo in Maschera'' on that visit, he received a thundering ovation from the audience at the Academy of Music. But he left before the final scene in which the governor of Colonial Boston is assassinated by conspirators. That might have been because of fatigue, Mr. Holzer suggests, but The New-York Herald reported that the police had received notice of a plot to kill Lincoln at the same moment as the onstage murder."
2009-10-09T00:00:00Z,"Hard-core disciples of the religion known as the Theater are scarce on the grounds these days. But two evangelists of that embattled creed have set up camp at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater to attest that the faith lives on. Portraying 1920s stage stars in the Manhattan Theater Club's Broadway revival of George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber's ''Royal Family,'' which opened on Thursday night, Jan Maxwell and Rosemary Harris are giving the kinds of performances that turn agnostics into true believers. Ms. Harris is Fanny Cavendish, the matriarch of an acting dynasty, and Ms. Maxwell is her daughter, Julie, the reigning goddess of Broadway. And when, in the play's second act, this mother and daughter start to preach the family gospel to an apostate in their midst, something close to a miracle occurs."

In its East Coast premiere, presented by the Pan Asian Repertory Theater and directed by Tim Dang, the show often seems to be trying too hard. The result is pretty shaky but rich with promise."

2009-10-09T00:00:00Z,"HESS--Scott, an account manager for the Chicago bureau of The New York Times, died suddenly on the morning of Tuesday, October 6, from congestive heart failure. He was 52. Mr. Hess passed away in New York City, the day after the funeral of his mother, Esta Hess. Mr. Hess will be remembered at The Times as a devoted worker, a gentle soul, and as someone whose deep and serious know-how at work was always leavened by his unstoppable wit. His infectious sense of humor came as welcome relief to clients and colleagues alike; there seemed no situation too formal for it. Colleagues remember Scott's upbeat personality, his always optimistic outlook, and his love for his family. He began his career at The Times in telesales in 1982, though his ties to the newspaper ran still deeper. His father, William Hess, was an avid supporter of The Times, and the younger Mr. Hess recalled his father subscribing to newspaper even through years when it strained the family's then-meager budget. Mr. Hess was born on April 16, 1957, and grew up in the Bronx. He attended the Bronx High School of Math and Science and Queens Community College in New York, graduating with an accounting degree, cum laude, in 1978. While working for B. Altman & Co., he met his wife, Jean LaMonica. They married on June 28, 1981. At The Times, Mr. Hess rose through the ranks of telesales into advertising sales. He left the newspaper briefly to work in a start-up programming company, then returned to The Times in 1986, the same year that he was asked to move to Chicago, and committed to it immediately, though he had never even visited the city. He came to have a great affinity for Chicago, and spent much of his career there. He spent lunch breaks taking in architectural tours, riding the water taxi along the Chicago River, and visiting the city's endless parks and beaches. It was in Chicago that Mr. Hess established himself as one of the company's premier account managers. His knowledge, in particular, of the financial sector was second to none. He was legendary among co-workers for his ability to put together financial presentations that were effective, concise and, all the while, entertaining. In 2005, he was awarded The New York Times Salesman of the Year. At heart, Mr. Hess was a family man. His successes at work were rarely discussed at home, though at work, he always spoke of his family. He is survived by his two sons, or, as he referred to them, his two ""hobbies,"" Justin and Taylor, his wife, Jean, and his brother, Milo. In addition to being a proud parent, Mr. Hess was a zealous dog lover. He was known around his neighborhood, in Clarendon Hills, Ill, for his ability to identify residents by their dog's names and breeds. His perspectives and observations could be childlike at times, a reflection of his gentle nature. He often scolded his children for crushing kitchen ants with too much force, and he took pleasure in open displays of affection for his family - especially displays involving his dog, Rocco - at what some might have seen as inappropriate moments. His warm nature, love for animals, and his genuine curiosity about life and living will be remembered by all whose lives he touched. A Memorial Mass will be held at Notre Dame Church in Clarendon Hills, Ill, at 10am on Monday, October 12."

(13) THE THIS OLD HOUSE HOUR For its 30th-anniversary season, ''This Old House,'' which recently won its 17th Emmy, for outstanding lifestyle program, returns to its home base, Boston, to undertake two projects. The first is the modest renovation of a 1915 Dutch colonial, above, in the suburb of Newton Centre, whose owners, Bill and Gillian Pierce, held off on sprucing up the home, purchased in 2004, until they could save some money. The second, to be shown later this season, is a foreclosed and vacant Second Empire building, from about the 1870s, in urban Roxbury, which will be transformed into two separate units of affordable homes. In this premiere episode Kevin O'Connor, the show's host; the general contractor Tom Silva; and the master carpenter Norm Abram meet with Paul Rovinelli, the architect for the Newton Centre project, and begin work -- which can be viewed round the clock at thisoldhouse.com/webcams. In a new season of ''Ask This Old House,'' at 7:30, the crew helps homeowners tackle common projects, starting with a backyard fire pit and a stovetop hood. 10:30 A.M.

But when Mr. Obama walked into the Rose Garden on Friday morning, having just been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize -- an honor that would normally be a moment of high celebration, if not the culmination of a life's work -- he was humble and self-deprecatory, popping a hole in the balloon of his own accomplishment.

But this so-called fee-for-service payment system does do little to encourage cost control or -- because, typically, no single health care provider is in charge -- to coordinate patient care effectively. Now a new approach that aims to do a better job of ''aligning incentives,'' as the wonks like to say, has grabbed the attention of policy experts and legislators. They talk about the ''accountable care organization,'' an approach in which doctors and hospitals agree to take joint responsibility for helping patients get well, or keeping them healthy in the first place, and to share in any financial benefits that result."

2009-10-11T00:00:00Z,"LEVINSON--John M.,M.D., of Rockland, DE and Kennedyville, MD died on October 4, 2009 at the age of 82. While he was a practicing physician and very active in the Delaware community for nearly sixty years, he may be remembered best for his pioneering medical and humanitarian work around the globe, most notably for his efforts with wartime refugees and civilians in Southeast Asia, Afghanistan, and Nicaragua. Born in Atlantic City, NJ, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy at the age of 17. He graduated from Lafayette College and Jefferson Medical College. He later served as a colonel in the USAF Reserve during the Cold War. An obstetrician-gynecologist, Dr. Levinson made his first of 26 trips to Southeast Asia in 1963. He taught surgery at the University of Saigon, worked in small jungle hospitals, and wrote the first paper in American medical literature on Medicine in South Vietnam. Dr. Levinson was among the first to assist provincial hospitals, establishing Volunteer Physicians in Vietnam. In 1971, he initiated laparoscopic surgery in Delaware and in 1979 performed the first laparoscopic surgery in China, returning later as an official guest of the Chinese Ministry of Health to establish clinics. As guests of the Kingdom of Bhutan, Dr. Levinson and Aid for International Medicine (AIM), in conjunction with The Explorers Club, retrained their basic health workers. He established the first ob/gyn surgical unit for the Afghanistan freedom fighters in 1986. Dr. Levinson was the founder of AIM, an organization that has provided millions of dollars of aid to the developing world. As its president he accepted the Dept. of State's A.I.D. Commendation from President Richard Nixon in 1971 and the Eisenhower Award, presented by People to People International ""for significant contribution to the advancement of international understanding."" From 1967 onward, he was a medical consultant to the US Senate, working closely with Senator Edward M. Kennedy as well as testifying six times before Senate committees and the Veterans Administration on health issues. For over 40 years he was a member of the Explorers Club, serving as president from 1985 to 1987. He was also a Rotarian, organizing the first Rotary meeting held at the North Pole. He served on countless boards, most notably The Explorers Club, The Royal Geographical Society of London, the World Affairs Council of Wilmington, Planned Parenthood, Blue Cross and Blue Shield and the State of Delaware's Board of Professional Responsibility. Having served as the ship's surgeon on numerous US and Russian tours to the Arctic and Antarctica, he organized and chaired the world's first conference on polar medicine. In 2007 he became the fourth Delawarean to receive the prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor--preceded by Vice President Joe Biden; Louis French, the former director of the FBI; and Ned Carpenter, a distinguished American and legal scholar. The Explorers Club honored him ""for outstanding contributions to third world medicine."" The Rotary Club of Wilmington gave him their distinguished service award twice and the Medical Society of Delaware gave him a special citation for his charitable service. Because of his international teaching, Jefferson Medical College gave him the singular honor of elevating him to Honorary Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Dr. Levinson lectured on five continents and did medical work on all seven. He published 31 medical papers, edited two medical texts and authored a book on shorebird decoys. He enjoyed sailing, the tranquility of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and carving wildfowl decoys. He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Elizabeth Carl Bell; his daughter, Patricia Anne, and her two daughters of Mountain View, CA; his son, John Carl, and his wife, Ellen, and their two sons of Southport, CT; and his son, Mark Jay, and his wife, Frances, and their three daughters of Double Bay, Australia. Private services will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations to his current favorite charities: Doctors Without Borders (doctorswithoutborders.com or 1-888-392-0392) or The Chesapeake Bay Foundation (cbf.org or 1-410-268-8816).

They were lined up in twos, cute little kids passing the ball between them, kicking it to the teacher and then running to the end of the line. The children filled both lanes of the bike path -- so as I turned onto the path from the street I could not swerve around them, and had to brake pretty hard. There is a nice stretch of soft, tempting grass just a block or so north of the path's southern end -- perfect for, say, kicking around a soccer ball. So why were they playing in the bike lane?"

2009-10-11T00:00:00Z,"When evaluating a Baby Belichick like Josh McDaniels, it is best to withhold judgment for a season or two. Bill Belichick's protégés often start out strong -- Eric Mangini was once Mangenius and Charlie Weis earned a Golden Dome-size contract after one season at Notre Dame -- but none have had sustained N.F.L. or college success. McDaniels, like Weis, Mangini and Romeo Crennel, has an X's-and-O's doctorate but an associate's degree in personnel management. But with Denver off to a 4-0 start, skeptics who thought McDaniels received too much supreme power too soon are starting to amend their theories. McDaniels is an offensive coach, but the Broncos are winning with defense. The defensive coordinator Mike Nolan installed a 3-4 system that makes proper use of the talents of pass rusher Elvis Dumervil (8 sacks) and linebacker Andra Davis (21 solo tackles). The turnaround has been drastic: the Broncos allowed 26 points in four games after allowing 117 points through the first four games of 2008. McDaniels's offense has not kept pace, but he has demonstrated an adaptability he appeared to lack during the off-season Jay Cutler drama. The Broncos overcame a 10-0 deficit against the Dallas Cowboys when McDaniels scrapped his beloved spread in favor of two-tight end running plays."

2009-10-11T00:00:00Z,"THE WILD SIDE Paying attention to the cries and hoots of others can be particularly important for animals that have a bad view of the neighborhood, or that spend a lot of time alone and thus don't get warnings from their own kind. An example: Gunther's dik-dik, a species of miniature antelope. These creatures live in pairs, in large territories. They have many enemies -- leopards, lions, eagles, hyenas, vultures and the like -- and spend much of their time hiding in thickets of undergrowth where they don't have a good view. So perhaps it's not surprising that they tune into the alarm calls of go-away birds -- which sit high in the tree-tops, announcing passing predators. All of this makes sense. You'd expect animals to evolve to pay attention to all the information available to them, especially in matters of life and death."

But in 1950 and 1951, in studios in Paris, London and New York, he invited in people who were less celebrated.

2009-10-11T00:00:00Z,"JOHNSON--Craig Winfield, passed away on Saturday night, October 3, at 9:18pm at Stanford Hospital surrounded by those he loved, the victim of a sudden and unexpected stroke. Craig was born in Pasadena, California on December 28, 1946, to Marian and Roger Johnson. He grew up in nearby Arcadia, where he excelled in track and debate before matriculating at Yale College, from which he graduated Magna Cum Laude in 1968. After college, he served in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia, and while there met and married Deborah Kendall, another Peace Corps volunteer, in Addis Ababa before returning to the States. Upon his return he attended Stanford Law School, graduating in 1974. As Silicon Valley began to boom, he joined the law firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati as its 14th attorney. With Deborah he raised three sons: Scott, Matthew, and Erik. Craig was a true visionary, quickly grasping the unique intersection of law, technology, and venture capital that the Bay Area afforded. He specialized in working with Silicon Valley's abundant technology startups, and left WSGR in 1993 to form Venture Law Group, a firm designed around his interest in funding and structuring fledgling companies. He was instrumental in bringing to market such companies as Yahoo!, Hotmail, and Rosetta Inpharmatics, and cofounded Garage Technology Ventures, Concept2Company, and Financial Engines. Craig's latest venture was cofounding Virtual Law Partners in 2008, yet another visionary advance in the provision of legal services. In this labor of love he found his heart's desire, and on August 15th of this year he married RoseAnn Rotandaro, one of his cofounders, in a beautiful and celebratory ceremony at his house in Portola Valley. Craig and RoseAnn had just completed a magical honeymoon, sailing the Mediterranean and cycling in the Slovenian Alps, shortly before Craig's untimely death. He was only 62. Craig's impact far exceeded his legal accomplishments. His goal was always to bring together the best people and brightest ideas, and see that both flourished. He was selfless in his work, and universally regarded as fair, honest, brilliant, and caring. He inspired the best in all around him, and helped them to believe in themselves as much as he believed in them. His friends will miss him dearly, and his family will miss him desperately. He leaves behind his sons Matt and Scott, Matt's wife Desdemona, his loving wife RoseAnn and her son Noah Rogers, his brother Brian and sister-in-law Joan, his nephew Derek and niece Kaitlin, his Uncle Ken Scott and his wife Sunny, and his father Roger. He goes into the embrace of his son Erik, his nephew Christopher, and his mother Marion, who left this earth before him. Craig will live on in the hearts of the innumerable family, friends, and associates whose lives he graced. A memorial service in honor of Craig's life will be held at the Stanford Arrillaga Alumni Center (326 Galvez St., Stanford, CA) on Sunday, October 11 at 2:30pm. Guests are invited to arrive an hour early to share memories and love.

The rapper T.I. was also absent as he is serving a prison sentence on a weapons conviction, but his fiancée, Tameka (Tiny) Cottle, was in attendance to accept his awards for album of the year (for “Paper Trail”) and best collaboration (for “Live Your Life” with Rihanna).

2009-10-12T11:26:05Z,"Normally, a gathering of hundreds of British men and women dressed in bathrobes and toting towels would not be all that remarkable an occurrence. But on Sunday, one such event was held to mark the 30th anniversary of “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” the comedic science-fiction franchise created by Douglas Adams, and the publication of a new book in the series, The Guardian reported. At Hitchcon 09, held at the Royal Festival Hall in London, fans assembled (many of them dressed in the shabby costume of the series’s hapless hero, Arthur Dent) to pay tribute to Mr. Adams, the author of the original “Hitchhiker’s” radio plays and the five-book sequence they spawned, who died in 2001. The convention also served as a kickoff for “And Another Thing…,” a new novel by the “Artemis Fowl” author Eoin Colfer that is cheekily being billed as the sixth entry in the “Hitchhiker’s Guide” trilogy. The American edition of “And Another Thing…” was released by Hyperion on Monday."
2009-10-12T12:03:18Z,"When it is not being used to bust cheating college students, a computer program used to detect plagiarism may have helped show that Shakespeare was an author of an unattributed play about Edward III, The Times of London reported. Brian Vickers, a professor at the Institute of English Studies at the University of London, told the newspaper that a comparison of phrases used in “The Reign of King Edward III,” a play published anonymously in 1596, with other works by Shakespeare published before then showed 200 matches of phrases of three or more words. The comparisons were made using the software program Pl@giarism, which the University of Maastricht developed to keep its students honest. Mr. Vickers also said that the program turned up 200 matches between the play and the works of Thomas Kyd, the Elizabethan playwright of “The Spanish Tragedy” who probably collaborated with Shakespeare on “The Reign of King Edward III.” Shakespeare’s authorship of the play has been widely debated, though it is included in “The Riverside Shakespeare” and “The Oxford Shakespeare” anthologies."
2009-10-12T12:59:25Z,"A lawyer for Roman Polanski said Sunday that his client realized that some of the support he has received since his arrest has not been helpful to securing his release, and added that he was concerned for Mr. Polanski’s health, Agence France-Presse reported. The lawyer, Hervé Temime, spoke to the wire service after visiting Mr. Polanski on Friday in the Swiss prison where he is being held for possible extradition to the United States more than three decades after fleeing sentencing on sex charges in 1978. In the interview, Mr. Temime said that Mr. Polanski was “very touched by the support he has received.” He added, “He also knows that some of it is counterproductive,” but did not elaborate. After Mr. Polanski’s arrest on Sept. 26, the French cultural minister, Frederic Mitterrand, called the arrest “absolutely horrifying” but later softened his remarks. Many filmmakers, actors and other personalities have signed petitions seeking Mr. Polanski’s release. Mr. Temime also said he found the 76-year-old Mr. Polanski to be “very worn out” during his visit."

The Sun reported that a horse-drawn undertaker’s carriage delivered Poe’s coffin to Westminster Hall, where Poe was memorialized by guest speakers as well as actors portraying Poe’s contemporaries. The actor and author Michael N. Langford, who spoke at the services, told The Sun, “I think Edgar Allan Poe would have been bemused by it, shocked by it. But I think it was what he deserved.”"

Academic abstention is the doctrine (never formally promulgated) that courts should defer to colleges and universities when it comes to matters like promotions, curricula, admission policies, grading, tenure, etc. The reasoning is that courts lack the competence to monitor academic behavior; they should get out of the way and let the professionals do the job.

To his face. My remedy of choice is Mama Mio's Tummy Rub Butter, which has the consistency of Crisco but smells divine. (Rosehip seed and borage oil are two of its active ingredients.) It's doing wonders for my torso, but I wouldn't recommend using it above the breast line. My male colleague, on the other hand, swears by StriVectin. This topical cream was originally conceived to combat stretch marks, but an informal employee test proved it to be equally effective on crow's-feet and laugh lines on men and women alike - and a brilliant new market strategy was born. (Another guy in our office admitted to having stretch marks on his knees; I wasn't entirely sure which of the two creams to recommend.) Mama Mio's cheeky instructions suggest other ways you and your partner can ""share"" the experience of its products, but maybe I'll just buy my boyfriend his own tube of StriVectin and call it a day."

In a news conference, Mr. Qashqavi suggested that the museum was reluctant to hand over the artifact because of the turmoil after Iran’s disputed presidential election in June. “Unfortunately, the British party did not honor its pledge on illogical, illegal and unethical grounds allegedly due to political developments in Iran,” he said, according to Reuters. “What does cultural heritage have to do with our domestic political developments?” A spokeswoman for the British Museum said that it still intends to send the cylinder to Iran."

2009-10-13T13:52:52Z,"Back when Junichiro Koizumi, the former prime minster of Japan, serenaded President Bush with “Love Me Tender” on a visit to Graceland, he was clearly laying the groundwork for a show business career. On the next step in his transition from politics to entertainment, Mr. Koizumi will lend his voice to a coming Japanese action movie, Agence France-Presse reported. In the film, “MegaMonsterBattle: Ultra Galaxy Legends,” the latest entry in Japan’s long-running “Ultraman” franchise, Mr. Kozumi portrays an extraterrestrial hero who battles outer-space aliens and monsters with flashing lights and a battle cry of “Pay for your transgression!” Mr. Koizumi, who retired from politics in 2006, had planned to turn down the role, but he was encouraged to take it by his son Shinjiro, who took over his seat in parliament. “No one else can play this significant role,” said Junko Kitazawa of Tsuburaya Productions, which is releasing the film in Japan on Dec. 12."
2009-10-13T12:29:40Z,"A stray fingerprint is not something you generally want to find on a valuable artwork — unless it was left there by Leonardo da Vinci. An art historian and a forensic art expert are among those saying that a fingerprint detected in a vellum portrait shows that it is the work of da Vinci, and not an early 19th-century German work as previously categorized, Antiques Trade Gazette reported. The work — a chalk, pen and ink portrait on vellum — was sold in 2007 for about $19,000 to a collector who took it to Martin Kemp, an emeritus professor of art history at Oxford University. Mr. Kemp, with the help of the forensic analyst Peter Paul Biro, found a fingerprint near the top of the work that they say is “highly comparable” to one found on da Vinci’s painting of St. Jerome in the Vatican. A chalk palm print in the neck of the portrait’s subject, believed to be the daughter of a 15th-century Milanese duke, is another piece of evidence the experts say supports the case that the work is by Leonardo da Vinci."

2009-10-13T14:06:56Z,"A Richard Prince exhibition has reopened at the Tate Modern museum in London without a photograph of Brooke Shields that drew the attention of the police, Bloomberg News reported. The Tate Modern was to show Mr. Prince’s exhibition “Spiritual America” as part of its program Pop Life: Art in a Material World but closed it from view after Scotland Yard warned that a photograph it included, taken of Ms. Shields in the nude when she was 10 years old, could violate obscenity laws. The picture, which was included in “Spiritual America” when it was shown at the Guggenheim Museum in 2007, was taken by Mr. Prince from another photograph made by Gary Gross in 1976 and authorized by Ms. Shields’s mother. In a statement, the Tate Modern said the photograph had been replaced with another of Ms. Shields as an adult, dressed in a bikini and leaning against a motorbike. The statement added that the change was made “in consultation with the artist.”"

2009-10-13T15:30:56Z,"Michael Jackson’s new song “This Is It” could prove a significant payday for Paul Anka. Although the song had been advertised as an unheard recording left behind by Mr. Jackson — and written by him alone — it became clear after it was released on Sunday night that “This Is It” was not new at all: it had been written by Mr. Jackson and Mr. Anka 26 years ago, and recorded by the singer Safire in 1991 as “I Never Heard.” Late Monday afternoon, the Jackson estate acknowledged Mr. Anka’s role and said he would be given credit. On Tuesday, the estate also confirmed that Mr. Anka would receive half of all due royalties for the song, which could be substantial. The song will play over the end credits of the film “This Is It” and feature prominently on its soundtrack. In addition, Mr. Anka would be owed fees for any licensed use of the song to commercials or other films. The Jackson estate is said to be in talks with Coca-Cola about possible use of “This Is It” in a large ad campaign, according to people with knowledge of the discussion who were not authorized to speak about it."

Brian Vickers, a professor at the Institute of English Studies at the University of London, told the newspaper that a comparison of the language in &#8220;The Reign of King Edward III,&#8221; published anonymously in 1596, with that of other works by Shakespeare published before it showed 200 matches of phrases of three or more words. The comparisons were made using the software program Pl@giarism, developed by the University of Maastricht to keep its students honest. Mr. Vickers also said the program turned up 200 matches of the play with the works of Thomas Kyd, the Elizabethan playwright of &#8220;The Spanish Tragedy&#8221; who probably collaborated with Shakespeare on &#8220;The Reign of King Edward III.&#8221; Shakespeare&#8217;s authorship of the play has been widely debated, though it is included in &#8220;The Riverside Shakespeare&#8221; and &#8220;The Oxford Shakespeare&#8221; anthologies."

At Hitchcon 09, held at the Royal Festival Hall in London, fans assembled (many of them dressed in the shabby costume of the series&#8217;s hapless hero, Arthur Dent) to pay tribute to Mr. Adams, who died in 2001. He was the author of the original &#8220;Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide&#8221; radio plays and the five-book sequence they spawned. The convention also served as a kickoff for &#8220;And Another Thing...,&#8221; a new novel by the &#8220;Artemis Fowl&#8221; author Eoin Colfer that is cheekily being billed as the sixth entry in the &#8220;Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide&#8221; trilogy.

Two ceremonies were held on Sunday to honor the 200th anniversary of the birth of Poe, the morbidly fixated man of letters, and drew 700 ticket holders as well as many other curious observers, some dressed in period costumes and others in T-shirts that read &#8220;Evermore!&#8221; (Fewer than 10 people were reported to have attended Poe&#8217;s first burial in 1849.) The Sun reported that a horse-drawn undertaker&#8217;s carriage delivered a coffin to Westminster Hall, where Poe was memorialized by guest speakers and actors portraying his contemporaries.

A premiere date for &#8220;Parenthood,&#8221; based on the 1989 film, has not been announced. ... It looks as if the producers of &#8220;FlashForward&#8221; will be spared the indignity of their show never actually reaching April 29, 2010, the mysterious future date that&#8217;s central to its unwinding mythology: Variety reports that ABC has picked up the series for a full season. ... The singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright will join New York City Opera&#8217;s &#8220;American Voices&#8221; celebration on Nov. 5, to help mark City Opera&#8217;s return to the newly renovated David H.

2009-10-13T00:00:00Z,"More than a year after an explosion of sparks, soot and frigid helium shut it down, the world's biggest and most expensive physics experiment, known as the Large Hadron Collider, is poised to start up again. In December, if all goes well, protons will start smashing together in an underground racetrack outside Geneva in a search for forces and particles that reigned during the first trillionth of a second of the Big Bang. Then it will be time to test one of the most bizarre and revolutionary theories in science. I'm not talking about extra dimensions of space-time, dark matter or even black holes that eat the Earth. No, I'm talking about the notion that the troubled collider is being sabotaged by its own future. A pair of otherwise distinguished physicists have suggested that the hypothesized Higgs boson, which physicists hope to produce with the collider, might be so abhorrent to nature that its creation would ripple backward through time and stop the collider before it could make one, like a time traveler who goes back in time to kill his grandfather."

He was a longtime resident of the Hudson Valley and Huntington, Long Island. Born in Brooklyn, New York on February 29, 1923, George Clarke, the son of Michael Henry and Mary (O'Hara) Clarke, was a WWII veteran, and a graduate of Pratt Institute. He began his noted advertising career at Remington Rand where he wrote the first computer ad for the Univac, the world's first supercomputer. George joined the J.

The agency continues to this day under the stewardship of his son, Richard A. Clarke. He was an accomplished impressionistic (oil on canvas) painter and leaves behind his life's works of art. His last work was his view of the Hudson River from his home in Rhinebeck. George will always be remembered for his wit and storytelling skills. He could never say no to a worthy cause, and donated advertising services and his original works of art to fundraising events for the Grace Smith House and the Junior League of Poughkeepsie. George was a member of the Barrett House School of Art and spent many enjoyable hours painting with Seth Nadel and his art class. He is survived by his lovely and devoted wife Juliana Ruhland-Clarke and his stepdaughter Eva-Maria (Nate) Dickinson.

2009-10-13T00:00:00Z,"Lemon Andersen says the word ''drive'' as if it were holy. Of course he doesn't mean it in the sense of what people do in cars or on golf courses. ''Drive,'' a noun that stuck and grew in Mr. Andersen's mind when he heard it uttered by a demanding teacher in a children's ballet class, means ambition, discipline and ruling passion. It is a force powerful enough to propel a teenage crack dealer from poverty in Brooklyn to a solo spotlight on a stage at the Public Theater. That's where ''County of Kings,'' Mr. Andersen's gleaming stand-up memoir, opened on Monday night. Seen in an earlier version at the Public as part of the Under the Radar Festival in January, this one-man show has since acquired a formidable team of producers, including the filmmaker Spike Lee, and a seriously enhanced focus, precision and polish. For Mr. Andersen, drive has clearly been a god worth serving."

2009-10-13T00:00:00Z,"MORRISON--James C.,Jr., 76, a long time resident of Short Hills, NJ and in later years, Summit, NJ, died Thursday, October 8 while attending a benefit golf outing for his favorite charity, the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation in Little Silver, NJ of which he was co-chairman. This is coincidentally the same time three years ago that his wife of 53 years, Elizabeth, died when he was also attending the Marine Corps benefit. The cause of death was congestive heart failure. Jim Morrison graduated from the Hill School, Pottstown, PA and Babson College, Boston in 1955, and then served in the Marine Corps for four years. For more than 50 years, he was one of the most well-known, if not legendary, figures in Wall Street financial circles, a member of the Bond Club, the Downtown Athletic Club and other associations. His career in institutional sales reads like a chronicle of Wall Street firms that merged into the pages of history. He began his career at Shearson Hamill & Co., then was a founder of Andreson & Co. From there he went on to Harris Upham & Co., and later to First Boston Corp. where his Father had been Executive Vice President for many years. Following that, Jim became Vice President Sales at Donaldson, Lufkin, & Jenrette for 27 years. In the last nine years, after DLJ was acquired by Credit Suisse, he was a Senior Vice President Institutional Sales at Gilford Securities in Manhattan. Above all, he was a family man, a devoted and loving Father to Elizabeth M. Cantrell of Washington, DC and Carolyn Payne, loving Grandfather of Charlotte Payne, Potomac Falls, VA, and brother and friend to Bruce H. Morrison, Chatham, NJ and Douglas Morrison of Atlanta, GA.; also, his sisters, Ann Winsor and Joan Beard of Washington, DC. Jim was a Board member of Squadron A Association in New York and a lifelong member of the Baltusrol Golf Club, Springfield, NJ where he was a frequent golfer and stalwart of the gin rummy table. His friends think of Jim as one of the most endearing characters to grace this part of the world, a man of great loyalty to friends in the East and across the country. Always generous of spirit, he was very kind, with a whimsical sense of humor that pervaded all his conversations. He could--and did--tell stories, good ones, on himself and others, a source of endless laughter and fun. As the larger-than-life man about town that he was, Jim Morrison was loved by many, and leaves a void in the lives of those who knew him. He will be greatly, greatly missed. A memorial service will be held Friday, November 6 at Christ Church of Short Hills. For further information or to send the family a condolence, visit: bradleyfuneralhomes.com.

Backed by a three-piece band, she launched into a cover of Melanie’s “Beautiful People,” a seemingly sincere, plaintive ballad from the flower-child 1960s that laments the social distance among strangers and the difficulty people have in embracing humankind. It was a cabaret-style beginning, sort of warm and socially acceptable, not what you expect from Ms. Bernhard, ordinarily more of a flaming provocateur. So it was almost reassuring when, little by little, the presentation turned satiric and sneering and familiarly misanthropic."

2009-10-14T21:25:18Z,"On a misty spring night in 2005, I approached my apartment, on a tony block on the Upper West Side facing the Hudson. I felt relaxed and calm. Earlier that day I had attended a yoga workshop with a guru from India, then completed a writing assignment for a health and spirituality magazine about, as it happened, instinct - or antar-jñana, inner knowledge. I opened the outer door to my vestibule, then crossed through its inner door and into my lobby, leaving my back to the entrance. I got a prickly feeling, I don't know why. I turned. There I saw, pushing open the inner door, an ink-black, gloved hand, exaggeratedly large, controlled and deliberate. It charged toward me. It was trailed by a body, the picture of death.It is difficult for me to render the horror of the image of that man entering my building lobby that night, so great is the disparity between its emotional charge for me now and the stereotypical, almost comical picture he presented. He was a figment from a nightmare. I guessed his height and weight at 6'3"" and 230 pounds, with the physicality of a boxer. The cops later told me that was right. His clothes were dark and innocuous - clean black jeans, black sneakers, a midnight-blue hoodie - as if chosen to leave no impression whatsoever. In contrast, on his face was a neoprene thermal ski mask, the type that tents in front to create a ridge and thus evokes to most anyone who's heard of him Darth Vader. I later discovered while searching on Google that this type of mask is favored by shoppers also enamored of vigilante-style military clothing and toy AK-47s - in other words it is meant to provoke a reaction. Of the figure's actual face I saw only slit-shaped, yellowed eyes and a broad, acned, coal-black forehead."

An art historian and a forensic art expert are among those saying that a fingerprint detected in a portrait, above, shows that it is the work of Leonardo, and not an early-19th-century German work as previously categorized, Antiques Trade Gazette reported. The work &#151; a chalk, pen and ink portrait on vellum &#151; was sold in 2007 for about $19,000 to a collector who took it to Martin Kemp, an emeritus professor of art history at Oxford University. Mr. Kemp, with the help of the forensic analyst Peter Paul Biro, found a fingerprint near the top of the work that they say is &#8220;highly comparable&#8221; to one found on Leonardo&#8217;s painting of St. Jerome in the Vatican. A chalk palm print in the neck of the portrait&#8217;s subject, believed to be the daughter of a 15th-century Milanese duke, is another piece of evidence the experts say supports the case that the work is by Leonardo."

Opponents say the drilling will harm water, air, wildlife and agriculture in the area. &#8220;To see an art company sell out the environment, that was a very egregious act as far as I was concerned,&#8221; Kathleen Dudley, the co-chairwoman of the watchdog group Drilling Mora County, told The A.P.

On Friday the filmmaker Spike Jonze (''Being John Malkovich'') will bring the book's wolf-suited protagonist, Max, and its fearsome menagerie to the big screen. In this documentary from Mr. Jonze and Lance Bangs, filmed at Mr. Sendak's Connecticut home and studio beginning in 2003, the writer and illustrator, above, now 81, muses on the things that inspired his creations, from his difficult relationship with his parents and his bond with his older siblings, to his fascination with death.

His life off the field was less well known. More often than not, Gibson has been characterized as a drunk and a drug user who was haunted by not making it to the major leagues with Jackie Robinson. Gibson was 35 when he died Jan. 20, 1947, three months before Robinson first took the field for the Brooklyn Dodgers."

As a teacher, he imparted his skills to younger scholars, and with the colleagues in his own department, he was responsible for enhancing greatly the depth, quality, and study of the collections under his care.

2009-10-14T00:00:00Z,"von BOTHMER--Dr. Dietrich, 90, died peacefully in his sleep on Monday, October 12, in Manhattan. The Metropolitan Museum's of Art's legendary curator, archaeologist, and historian of classical art is survived by his devoted wife of 43 years, Joyce Blaffer von Bothmer; his son Bernard Nicholas von Bothmer and his wife, Jane, of San Francisco; his daughter Maria Elizabeth Villalba and her husband, Jerome, of New York; and his five adoring grandchildren: Isabel, Victoria, and Charles Villalba, and Athena and Tatiana von Bothmer. Dr. von Bothmer was born on October 26, 1918, in Eisenach, Germany, and in 1938 was awarded the last of that year's two German Rhodes Scholarships before World War Two, allowing him to flee the Nazi dictatorship which he opposed and detested. At Oxford, he studied under Sir John Beazley, earning a diploma in 1939 in Classical Archaeology. Over the next thirty years, he worked closely with Beazley to build up the great works on Attic Black and Red-figure Vase-Painters that changed the way scholars thought about Greek art. And for the rest of his life, he was acknowledged as perhaps the finest connoisseur of Greek vase-painting in the world. While visiting museums in the United States in the summer of 1939 for what was meant to be but a three month stay, World War Two began, preventing Dietrich from returning to Europe. Through a network of generous scholarships and fellowships, he was able to continue his studies at the University of California, Berkeley (interrupted by a brief fellowship at the University of Chicago), where he earned his Ph.D. in 1944. Though not yet a citizen, Dietrich volunteered for the U.S. Army and fought heroically in the South Pacific. There he was awarded both the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart for carrying, while wounded, a fellow soldier back to safety five miles through heavily fortified Japanese lines. Subsequently, he received U.S. citizenship, and in 1946 was appointed a curatorial assistant in the department of Greek and Roman art at the Metropolitan, where he remained for 64 years until his death. He was named curator in 1959, department chairman in 1973, and in 1990 Distinguished Research Curator. In 1965 he began teaching at the Institute of Fine Arts, N.Y.U. Dietrich was the recipient of numerous awards and citations, including a Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur; a member of the Academie Francaise (one of only two Americans to have this honor); an honorary fellow of Wadham College; and several honorary doctorates. The author of a number of standard monographs and hundreds of articles and reviews, he was a wonderful mentor to his students and a devoted teacher. We will all greatly miss his generosity of spirit, his philanthropic ethos, his unparalleled intellect, his endless passion for Greek antiquities, his unquenchable thirst for knowledge, his encyclopedic knowledge of the history of Western Civilization, his zest for verbal sparring, and his enormous joie de vivre. His passing has left a gaping hole. A true lion has been lost: a polyglot, a patriarch, a patriot, an optimist, a genius. Family will receive friends on Thursday from 2-4 and 6-8pm at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue. Funeral services will be held at 11am on Friday, October 16, at St. James' Episcopal Church, Madison Avenue at 71st Street."

Visit any hilltop town or small city on a weekend in October and you're likely to find a sagra, a gastronomic spectacle venerating pumpkins or chestnuts or just about any vegetable, nut or meat that's grown and produced regionally in fresh abundance. Sagre sometimes last all weekend and often culminate on Sunday with a celebratory feast. I recently visited Anguillara, a town built into the Sabatini hills around Lake Bracciano, near Rome, and the Sagra del Fungo was in full tilt. By 1 p.m. the parking lot hosting the festival was in a state of mushroom mania, with hundreds of people queuing up to try porcini sauces and spreads. There were other funghi - trucks pulled up to the event laden with golden chanterelles and purple and bronze flat-capped meadow mushrooms for sale - but porcini ruled the day, featuring prominently in most of the dishes served in mess-hall fashion beneath a giant white tent. If you're in Italy this fall, it's worth attending a sagra, if only to witness the unique customs of Italian food culture.

2009-10-15T00:00:00Z,"Being $6.8 million in debt and struggling with diminished fund-raising, leaders of the Shakespeare & Company theater in Lenox, Mass., say they are cutting jobs, restructuring the theater’s business model and taking other steps in hopes of shoring up its year-round productions and education programs. The company has been in a financial downward spiral for years, according to an independent study of its finances that was released on Tuesday. The theater needs approximately $2.3 million in immediate cash to cover operation expenses through March; in the long term, it has to wrestle with a $4.75 million operating deficit that has accumulated since 2005. Partly in response to the study, by the Nonprofit Finance Fund, which was commissioned by the theater, Shakespeare & Company announced that it would shift more staff members from full-year to seasonal status; eliminate some jobs in addition to the seven full-time positions already trimmed; devise a new business model to streamline operations; and continue a hiring freeze that began this year."

Several weeks of turmoil followed, and Mr. Dillner resigned in August.

She was the devoted wife of Colonel Bernt Balchen, Polar Aviator, who predeceased her in 1973. She was born in New York City August 1, 1916, the daughter of John Edward Schipper and Marie B Schipper. The family soon established residence in Barberry Bend, Pleasantville, NY where she spent her youth and studied art and sculpture. She then attended George Washington University in the mid 1930s studying International Affairs and soon after was one of three women to graduate from Columbia University with a degree in business. She rose to Research Director at Fairchild Publications where she was not only employed but frequently published. Although living and working in New York City, her roots were in Westchester and she maintained a home in Chappaqua, NY where she enjoyed gardening and her flowers. It was here that she met her late husband and with her talents in research dedicated her time to assuring his legacy with exhibits in the Smithsonian, Library of Congress and Air Force Academy. She was as kind as she was generous and she supported many causes, especially Native Americans, the arts, and the New York Public Library. Her love of travel included many trips on the Queen Mary and QE2 and she regularly attended the symphony and ballet. She is survived by her brother Robert of Stratton, Maine, numerous nieces and nephews and a stepson Lauritz and predeceased by her brother Edward, Paul and sister Marie.

2009-10-15T00:00:00Z,"von BOTHMER--Dr. Dietrich, 90, died peacefully in his sleep on Monday, October 12, in Manhattan. The Metropolitan Museum's of Art's legendary curator, archaeologist, and historian of classical art is survived by his devoted wife of 43 years, Joyce Blaffer von Bothmer; his son Bernard Nicholas von Bothmer and his wife, Jane, of San Francisco; his daughter Maria Elizabeth Villalba and her husband, Jerome, of New York; and his five adoring grandchildren: Isabel, Victoria, and Charles Villalba, and Athena and Tatiana von Bothmer. Dr. von Bothmer was born on October 26, 1918, in Eisenach, Germany, and in 1938 was awarded the last of that year's two German Rhodes Scholarships before World War Two, allowing him to flee the Nazi dictatorship which he opposed and detested. At Oxford, he studied under Sir John Beazley, earning a diploma in 1939 in Classical Archaeology. Over the next thirty years, he worked closely with Beazley to build up the great works on Attic Black and Red-figure Vase-Painters that changed the way scholars thought about Greek art. And for the rest of his life, he was acknowledged as perhaps the finest connoisseur of Greek vase-painting in the world. While visiting museums in the United States in the summer of 1939 for what was meant to be but a three month stay, World War Two began, preventing Dietrich from returning to Europe. Through a network of generous scholarships and fellowships, he was able to continue his studies at the University of California, Berkeley (interrupted by a brief fellowship at the University of Chicago), where he earned his Ph.D. in 1944. Though not yet a citizen, Dietrich volunteered for the U.S. Army and fought heroically in the South Pacific. There he was awarded both the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart for carrying, while wounded, a fellow soldier back to safety five miles through heavily fortified Japanese lines. Subsequently, he received U.S. citizenship, and in 1946 was appointed a curatorial assistant in the department of Greek and Roman art at the Metropolitan, where he remained for 64 years until his death. He was named curator in 1959, department chairman in 1973, and in 1990 Distinguished Research Curator. In 1965 he began teaching at the Institute of Fine Arts, N.Y.U. Dietrich was the recipient of numerous awards and citations, including a Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur; a member of the Academie Francaise (one of only two Americans to have this honor); an honorary fellow of Wadham College; and several honorary doctorates. The author of a number of standard monographs and hundreds of articles and reviews, he was a wonderful mentor to his students and a devoted teacher. We will all greatly miss his piercing wit, generosity of spirit, his philanthropic ethos, his unparalleled intellect, his endless passion for Greek antiquities, his unquenchable thirst for knowledge, his encyclopedic knowledge of the history of Western Civilization, his zest for verbal sparring, and his enormous joie de vivre.

2009-10-15T00:00:00Z,"AXINN--Donald E. The Hofstra community is deeply saddened by the passing of Donald E. Axinn, trustee emeritus of the Hofstra University Board of Trustees. Mr. Axinn was the founder and chairman of the Donald E. Axinn Companies, an investment firm and developer of office and industrial parks throughout the New York metropolitan area. Mr. Axinn combined his two great passions, flying and writing, in many of his published works: his three novels, eleven books of poetry and published articles and essays. Mr. Axinn first served on Hofstra's Board of Trustees from 1970 to 1979, including terms as Secretary and Vice Chair. He took a leave from the Board in 1971-1972 to assume, on a pro bono basis, the Associate Deanship of the Hofstra College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and to be Director of the Institute of the Arts. He was made a Trustee Emeritus in 1979. He joined the University's 50th Anniversary Committee in 1983, and he rejoined the Board of Trustees as an active trustee in 1984. In 1987, he received the Estabrook Award from the Alumni Organization. In 1988, in recognition of his many accomplishments and his service as a valued advisor to the University, the Hofstra University Library was named the Joan and Donald E. Axinn Library. He retired from the Board of Trustees in 1990 and once again became a Trustee Emeritus. In addition, at the time of the library naming, the annual Axinn Lecture and a fund in support of ecology and conservation were created from an endowment Mr. and Mrs. Axinn provided. In 2003, Mr. Axinn was honored at the annual Hofstra University Gala with the Hofstra University Presidential Medal, the highest honor the University bestows upon an individual. Mr. Axinn was renowned for his support of the arts and of the metropolitan New York area, having co-founded the Interfaith Nutrition Network, and served on a number of boards for the past three decades, including the Cradle of Aviation, which named an exhibit hall in honor of his generosity. He is a graduate of Middlebury College and has a master of arts in humanities (with distinction) from Hofstra, and he has also been awarded five honorary doctorates. In tribute to the memory of Mr. Axinn, all Hofstra University flags will be lowered to half staff. Marilyn Monter Chair, Board of Trustees Stuart Rabinowitz President Hofstra University"

But with the emergence of specific legislation from the Senate Finance Committee, that has changed. On the eve of the bill's passage through the committee on Tuesday, the industry's lobbying group, America's Health Insurance Plans, issued a report arguing that under the legislation, the cost of premiums would soar. That report was bolstered by another on Wednesday from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association that essentially reached the same conclusion."
2009-10-15T00:00:00Z,"PLANSKY--Carl, artist, teacher, paint maker, died on October 10, 2009 of heart failure at the age of 58. He was a resident of East Meredith and Brooklyn, NY. Born in Miami Beach, Carl moved to New York in 1970 to attend Hans Hofmann's New York Studio School. He also studied with artist Joan Mitchell, a close personal friend and strong influence on his work. His paintings are drawn from direct observation, and revel in pitch-perfect color, compositional elegance, and highly expressive brushwork. Also a respected and influential teacher, he guided students at many institutions, including a return to the New York Studio School from 2004 to the present. Forever dedicated to the craft of oil painting, he began making small batches of handmade paint in the 1980s for himself and artist friends. This would eventually become Williamsburg Oil Paint, now widely regarded as one of the premier oil paint makers in the world and used by some of the most respected artists working today. Carl believed the only life worth living was based in salvation through individualism. Throughout his life, Carl was intensely committed to the honest, almost cathartic, personal expression found through paint, an idea often at odds with contemporary art world trends. It was a position he found equally frustrating and empowering, as he said recently, ""the art world is cool and hip. [I am] too hot and passionate."" At the time of his death, Carl had become an esteemed and successful artist on his own terms, without compromise or regret. He is survived by his mother, Mitzi Miller, sisters Beverly Plansky and Mary Beth Makias, and partner Chris Brown. A memorial will be held 3pm, Sunday, October 18 at the New York Studio School (8 West 8th Street), where his exhibition Sacred Monsters: Carl Plansky's Divas, is currently on view through Saturday."

Earlier this week, Shockey told The Times-Picayune of New Orleans that he left the Giants with a ''bitter taste in my mouth'' when he was traded before the 2008 season. One of the many things that annoyed Shockey was being told to sit in the stands at the Super Bowl in Glendale, Ariz., when the Giants defeated the New England Patriots for the championship after the 2007 season. Shockey was out with a broken leg and wanted to stand on the sideline with his teammates.

These days a new generation of wetsuits makes it easier to spend hours in the ocean -- regardless of the season or the latitude -- without hindering movement. One manufacturer solved the problem by building a suit that uses battery power to generate warmth. Another used a seemingly old-fashioned solution, lining the suit with wool, which is actually a bit high-tech: the merino blend uses recycled polyester to maximize wicking. And several companies have come up with alternatives to oil-based neoprene, all of which they advertise as environmentally friendly."

The last two times the Book Review has gone looking for an appropriately striking vase painting to illustrate reviews about the classical world, we've chosen examples that turned out to be from their collection. The first was a serene red-figure painting of a woman sacrificing at an altar that illustrated a review of Joan Breton Connelly's ""Portrait of a Priestess."" The second, with our review of Caroline Alexander's ""War That Killed Achilles,"" in the issue of Oct. 18, is a different animal. Occupying one side of a magnificent Athenian amphora of about 515 B.C., it is a fearfully dark, passion-filled black-figure panel, attributed to the Rycroft Painter. It shows the aged Trojan king, Priam, begging a sinister Achilles for the body of his son Hector, whom Achilles has killed and whose corpse lies beside Achilles' banqueting couch. This is the most crucial scene in the ""Iliad,"" from the final Book 24. As expressed in a highly detailed account of the scene on the Web site of the Perseus Project, a classics database at Tufts University, ""Among Greek vases depicting the ransom of Hector, the Toledo amphora is remarkable for the intense emotion expressed in the plaintive figure of Priam and for the attention focused on the pitiful figure of this bereaved king."""

But the Taliban have closed the school and forced thousands of people to flee the city. Malala moves from place to place - four cities in two months - living with relatives, while Mr. Yousafzai heads to Peshawar to stage protests in the hope of pressuring the government to rescue the city from the Taliban. They will return to Swat, but everything will be different. It is heart-rending; beautifully told and beautifully shot. Be warned, however, that there are several disturbing scenes. Though long (nearly 20 minutes), the story moves quickly toward its poignant, hopeful conclusion. (E.O.)"

That was to have changed with this year&#8217;s cycle of Beethoven symphonies by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, where he is music director. But back surgery earlier this month means the quirk will stand, for now. The Boston Symphony said on Thursday that Mr. Levine would not be back on the podium for a concert until Oct. 30 and 31, when he is scheduled to conduct Beethoven&#8217;s Symphonies Nos. 6 and 7 at Symphony Hall, and then move on to the Eighth and Ninth the following week. Rafael Fr&#252;hbeck de Burgos will substitute for Mr. Levine in the first program of the cycle, featuring Symphonies Nos. 1, 2 and 5, from Oct. 22 through Oct. 24. The orchestra&#8217;s assistant conductor, Julian Kuerti, will step in for the second program, which consists of Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4, on Oct. 27 and 29. Mr. Levine was to have led the orchestra at Carnegie Hall&#8217;s opening night this month, but the surgery forced him to withdraw. The Boston Symphony said he expected to conduct it at Carnegie on Nov. 2., when he will repeat performances of the Sixth and Seventh. Mr. Levine is also music director of the Metropolitan Opera, where he is expected to return for his engagements to lead &#8220;Les Contes d&#8217;Hoffmann,&#8221; opening on Dec. 3."

Because of quirks in the formula, doctors have faced the prospect of severe reductions and Congress has stepped in repeatedly to prevent those cuts by enacting laws now known as the annual ''doc fix.'' Under current law, doctors face cuts of 21.5 percent in January and about 5.5 percent in each of the next four years."

2009-10-16T00:00:00Z,"von BOTHMER--Dr. Dietrich, 90, died peacefully in his sleep on Monday, October 12, in Manhattan. The Metropolitan Museum's of Art's legendary curator, archaeologist, and historian of classical art is survived by his devoted wife of 43 years, Joyce Blaffer von Bothmer; his son Bernard Nicholas von Bothmer and his wife, Jane, of San Francisco; his daughter Maria Elizabeth Villalba and her husband, Jerome, of New York; and his five adoring grandchildren: Isabel, Victoria, and Charles Villalba, and Athena and Tatiana von Bothmer. Dr. von Bothmer was born on October 26, 1918, in Eisenach, Germany, and in 1938 was awarded the last of that year's two German Rhodes Scholarships before World War Two, allowing him to flee the Nazi dictatorship which he opposed and detested. At Oxford, he studied under Sir John Beazley, earning a diploma in 1939 in Classical Archaeology. Over the next thirty years, he worked closely with Beazley to build up the great works on Attic Black and Red-figure Vase-Painters that changed the way scholars thought about Greek art. And for the rest of his life, he was acknowledged as perhaps the finest connoisseur of Greek vase-painting in the world. While visiting museums in the United States in the summer of 1939 for what was meant to be but a three month stay, World War Two began, preventing Dietrich from returning to Europe. Through a network of generous scholarships and fellowships, he was able to continue his studies at the University of California, Berkeley (interrupted by a brief fellowship at the University of Chicago), where he earned his Ph.D. in 1944. Though not yet a citizen, Dietrich volunteered for the U.S. Army and fought heroically in the South Pacific. There he was awarded both the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart for carrying, while wounded, a fellow soldier back to safety five miles through heavily fortified Japanese lines. Subsequently, he received U.S. citizenship, and in 1946 was appointed a curatorial assistant in the department of Greek and Roman art at the Metropolitan, where he remained for 64 years until his death. He was named curator in 1959, department chairman in 1973, and in 1990 Distinguished Research Curator. In 1965 he began teaching at the Institute of Fine Arts, N.Y.U. Dietrich was the recipient of numerous awards and citations, including a Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur; a member of the Academie Francaise (one of only two Americans to have this honor); an honorary fellow of Wadham College; and several honorary doctorates. The author of a number of standard monographs and hundreds of articles and reviews, he was a wonderful mentor to his students and a devoted teacher. We will all greatly miss his piercing wit, generosity of spirit, his philanthropic ethos, his unparalleled intellect, his endless passion for Greek antiquities, his unquenchable thirst for knowledge, his encyclopedic knowledge of the history of Western Civilization, his zest for verbal sparring, and his enormous joie de vivre. His passing has left a gaping hole. A true lion has been lost: a polyglot, a patriarch, a patriot, an optimist, a genius. Funeral services will be held at 11am on Friday, October 16, at St. James' Episcopal Church, Madison Avenue at 71st Street."

2009-10-16T00:00:00Z,"SHAW--Iris Azian, 1927-2009, a pioneering child advocate and loving wife and mother, died on October 9 in Pasadena, California at age 82. The cause was complications from leukemia and arterial disease. Though she earned two law degrees in her lifetime, Mrs. Shaw chose not to practice law but to use her knowledge and skills as an informed volunteer to help the abused and neglected children caught up in the foster care and juvenile justice systems. Mrs. Shaw was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on January 15, 1927 to parents of Armenian descent. Her shopkeeper father, like many immigrants of that time, believed in the American Dream and told his daughter that she could make anything of herself in this country. She went on to graduate from Boston Latin School, trained as a concert pianist, and became one of the first women to earn a JD from Boston University Law School. Immediately afterward she passed the Massachusetts bar exam with the highest score to that date. In 1949, a Harvard student named Anthony Shaw working as a waiter the summer before his senior year took her order, and they married six years later. In 1970, with three children in tow they moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, where Dr. Shaw became a professor of pediatric surgery at the University of Virginia and Mrs. Shaw devoted herself to helping children in the web of the dependency court and foster care systems. She used her knowledge of the law and her devotion to child welfare to help found Community Attention, group homes that provided adolescent offenders an alternative to more punitive, and less effective, detention facilities. This rehabilitation option was controversial at the time but proved extremely effective in lowering recidivism rates and became a much-replicated model. During these years Mrs. Shaw also chaired the board that oversaw the regional jail, taught law through the University of Virginia to law enforcement and security officers and advised the governor of Virginia on juvenile justice issues. She and Dr. Shaw moved to Pasadena, California, in 1981, where she joined the ranks of volunteers at CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) in Los Angeles. Though only five feet tall, she often traveled alone into many of the city's roughest neighborhoods to interview relatives of children whose fate lay with the courts so she could represent those children as effectively as possible. Her tireless advocacy moved Los Angeles County to name her its Volunteer of the Year in 1994. She discovered late in life that she loved nothing more than zipping around icebergs and glaciers in an inflatable Zodiac boat in the Arctic and Antarctic, and she and Dr. Shaw made numerous trips to the far north and far south. She did all she did with profound humility, always giving and never expecting anything in return. She is survived by Dr. Anthony Shaw, her husband of 54 years; three children, Dr. Brian Shaw of Roanoke, Virginia, Diana Shaw Clark of London, UK, and Daniel Shaw of Woody Creek, Colorado; eight grandchildren; and a sister, Mrs. Seda Dennis of Manomet, Massachusetts. In lieu of flowers or anything else, the family asks that contributions be made to: The Iris A. Shaw Memorial Fund, CASA of Los Angeles, 201 Centre Plaza Drive, Suite 3, Monterey Park, CA 91754-2142. 323-526-6329"
2009-10-16T00:00:00Z,"One way Congress hopes to lower health care spending is by authorizing ''biosimilars.'' Those, essentially, would be generic versions of biotechnology drugs, medicines, like the cancer drug Avastin, that currently can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year. But a commentary published online this week by The New England Journal of Medicine says the current provisions in the health care legislation would do little to reduce prices of such drugs. That is because the new rules would not allow the copycat drugs to be sold until the original biotechnology drug had been on the market for 12 years. Such a delay, the authors argue, would discourage would-be competitors."

2009-10-16T00:00:00Z,"The Angels were the only American League team to have a winning record against the Yankees in the Joe Torre era. They have evolved from the team of Tim Salmon, Garret Anderson and Darin Erstad to the team of Torii Hunter, Vladimir Guerrero and Bobby Abreu, yet they still pester Joe Girardi's Yankees by putting balls in play and running like mad. Four September meetings this season produced three Yankees victories, all by one or two runs. With the pennant on the line, it has the makings of a classic series. HISTORY 4.00 Not one of the Yankees starters has a good career record against the Angels. C. C. Sabathia's earned run average against them is 4.72, A. J. Burnett's is 4.43 and Andy Pettitte's is 4.70. Even closer Mariano Rivera has been ordinary against the Angels, with a 3.56 mark. Then again, it's worth noting that the Angels' Game 1 starter, John Lackey, has a 4.66 E.R.A. against the Yankees."

After growing the grass to British Open rough lengths five years ago to slow down U.S.C., the turf turned against Notre Dame today. On the game's final play, with Notre Dame trailing by 7 and on the 4-yard line, Weis said that the intended Notre Dame receiver, Duval Kamara, slipped coming out of his turn. He said Kamara would have been open because U.S.C. had double-teamed Golden Tate. Kamara's slip on the Irish turf continued Weis's winless streak against U.S.C. and was perhaps some karmic retribution for Weis growing the grass so long in 2005."

Weisman, who said last month that 11 silk-screen paintings, right, by Andy Warhol had been stolen from his home, has waived the $25 million insurance policy that would reimburse him for the paintings, The Seattle Times reported. The Los Angeles police have described the case as puzzling, saying that there were no signs of a break-in and that the Warhol works were the only valuable items missing from the home. Mr. Weisman, 69, said that he had waived the insurance policy because he did not want insurance investigators searching through his private papers as part of an inquiry, according to the Seattle newspaper. “That’s the only reason, and it’s a good enough reason,” Mr. Weisman said. The Los Angeles Times reported that detectives assigned to the case said that they had found Mr. Weisman’s decision curious and planned to question him about it."

The statement came in a June 22 letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had asked for details on Sotheby’s compensation system, along with other matters. The letter pointed out that Sotheby’s — a publicly traded company that is required to release financial data — competes fiercely with Christie’s, a private company not subject to the same regulations. Disclosing details of its compensation practices “would result in significant competitive harm,” Sotheby’s said. The commission responded with a letter saying it had “no further comments at this time” on the issues the letter had raised. The commission this week released the correspondence, which Bloomberg News reported, through its Web site, sec.gov."

The debate among Democrats over the public option -- a government-run insurance plan to compete with private insurers -- has mainly focused on two proposals. One is a ''robust'' plan, in which payments to doctors, hospitals and other providers would be tied to Medicare's rates. The other would require the government insurance program to negotiate its own payment rates."

(HBO) SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE (2008) A young man from a poor area near Mumbai (Dev Patel, above left, with Anil Kapoor) becomes a game show contestant and explains how he knows the answers to all those questions in this contemporary fairy tale from Danny Boyle. The film won eight Oscars, including best motion picture, best achievement in directing for Mr. Boyle and best writing for Simon Beaufoy. The film is ''a gaudy, gorgeous rush of color, sound and motion,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''In the end, what gives me reluctant pause about this bright, cheery, hard-to-resist movie is that its joyfulness feels more like a filmmaker's calculation than an honest cry from the heart about the human spirit (or, better yet, a moral tale),'' she said, adding that Mr. Boyle ''plucked my heartstrings'' with ''well-practiced dexterity, coaxing laughter and sobs out of each sweet, sour and false note.'' 10:30 A.M.

2009-10-18T00:00:00Z,"O.K., so it’s a classic. Some would call it, like the tuxedo jacket or the little black dress, one of fashion’s most iconic pieces. It came to light in the 1940s when, because of the war and burgeoning modern life, items like the floor-length tea gown became less of an option. But it was in the ’50s that the twin set met its moment. Think of any movie or TV show set back then. Did every woman really, truly wear it every day? I find it hard to believe because here’s the truth: yeah, they work if you’re Grace Kelly or January Jones. If your shoulders are narrow and your waist even smaller and you have the sort of radiant beauty that transforms something inherently plain into the epitome of chic. (Tilda Swinton, check! Dame Judi Dench, check! The Duchess of Devonshire, check!) But if you’re a mere mortal like me, wearing a cardigan over a matching short-sleeve sweater risks making you looking like an elderly aunt from the pages of P. G. Wodehouse. Which makes me all the more envious of all those utterly unflappable, self-confident beauties, who don a twin set (like the Pringle of Scotland one above) and look implacably terrific.

2009-10-18T00:00:00Z,"O.K., let’s get back to basics on this one. “It,” according to Elinor Glyn, who coined the expression in a novella titled simply “It,” “is that quality possessed by some which draws all others with its magnetic force. With ‘It’ you draw all men if you are a woman — all women if you are a man.” While Glyn arrived at this formulation to describe Clara Bow, an American who played the “It” girl in the eponymous 1927 movie version, the writer was herself British. And although Bow’s sweet creaminess of an ingénue in the steely crucible of a femme fatale became synonymous with sex appeal at the end of the orgasmically yelping ’20s, when the “It” girl tottered back on the scene after World War II, she was a Brit once more."

2009-10-18T00:00:00Z,"When it comes to cutting-edge style and pop culture, no city can swing it like London — and this year is the 25th anniversary of the British Fashion Council, which has helped promote some of the country’s most iconoclastic designers. It was in the fall of 1984, during London’s first fashion week, that a young unknown named John Galliano presented a groundbreaking collection titled “Afghanistan Repudiates Western Ideals.” Other innovative designers would follow, like the duo behind Bodymap, who turned club-kid wear into high fashion; Alexander McQueen, who gave the world the super-low-riding “bumster pant”; and Hussein Chalayan, who ended one show with models shattering paste dresses with little hammers. It seems apt that with the current wave of homegrown talent — Giles Deacon, Jonathan Saunders, Christopher Kane, Marios Schwab, Louise Goldin and Mary Katrantzou, among others — making international headlines, a British superstar would return home for the council’s silver anniversary. After years of showing in Milan, Christopher Bailey brought Burberry, the ultimate heritage label, back to London for his spring 2010 show. Indeed, Britannia still rules. [?][?][?] ARMAND LIMNANDER."

2009-10-18T00:00:00Z,"SHAW--Iris Azian, 1927-2009, a pioneering child advocate and loving wife and mother, died on October 9 in Pasadena, California at age 82. The cause was complications from leukemia and arterial disease. Though she earned two law degrees in her lifetime, Mrs. Shaw chose not to practice law but to use her knowledge and skills as an informed volunteer to help the abused and neglected children caught up in the foster care and juvenile justice systems. Mrs. Shaw was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on January 15, 1927 to parents of Armenian descent. Her shopkeeper father, like many immigrants of that time, believed in the American Dream and told his daughter that she could make anything of herself in this country. She went on to graduate from Boston Latin School, trained as a concert pianist, and became one of the first women to earn a JD from Boston University Law School. Immediately afterward she passed the Massachusetts bar exam with the highest score to that date. In 1949, a Harvard student named Anthony Shaw working as a waiter the summer before his senior year took her order, and they married six years later. In 1970, with three children in tow they moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, where Dr. Shaw became a professor of pediatric surgery at the University of Virginia and Mrs. Shaw devoted herself to helping children in the web of the dependency court and foster care systems. She used her knowledge of the law and her devotion to child welfare to help found Community Attention, group homes that provided adolescent offenders an alternative to more punitive, and less effective, detention facilities. This rehabilitation option was controversial at the time but proved extremely effective in lowering recidivism rates and became a much-replicated model. During these years Mrs. Shaw also chaired the board that oversaw the regional jail, taught law through the University of Virginia to law enforcement and security officers and advised the governor of Virginia on juvenile justice issues. She and Dr. Shaw moved to Pasadena, California, in 1981, where she joined the ranks of volunteers at CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) in Los Angeles. Though only five feet tall, she often traveled alone into many of the city's roughest neighborhoods to interview relatives of children whose fate lay with the courts so she could represent those children as effectively as possible. Her tireless advocacy moved Los Angeles County to name her its Volunteer of the Year in 1994. She discovered late in life that she loved nothing more than zipping around icebergs and glaciers in an inflatable Zodiac boat in the Arctic and Antarctic, and she and Dr. Shaw made numerous trips to the far north and far south. She did all she did with profound humility, always giving and never expecting anything in return. She is survived by Dr. Anthony Shaw, her husband of 54 years; three children, Dr. Brian Shaw of Roanoke, Virginia, Diana Shaw Clark of London, UK, and Daniel Shaw of Woody Creek, Colorado; eight grandchildren; and a sister, Mrs. Seda Dennis of Manomet, Massachusetts. In lieu of flowers or anything else, the family asks that contributions be made to: The Iris A.

With washed leather flak jackets at Haider Ackermann (center left), olive-drab shirts at Balmain (below left) and tailored military tops at Celine (far left), a surplus supply of the stuff came marching down the Paris runways. And lately the French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld (seated) has been dressing like a drill sergeant in khaki-colored button-downs and an army-green parka. But, of course, the look is no new thing. Military style regularly appears, in some degree, on the runways. For this fall, Comme des Garçons sent out an array of fleece-lined military jackets and olive-drab coats. Dsquared did cargo pants.

Hundreds of women wore variations of the look.

The show ended with several models having a romp in the hay with a boyfriend.

His latest book, an homage to the women of flamenco entitled ''Mil Besos'' -- 1,000 kisses, in Spanish -- is perhaps his most powerful work yet. The women in these images, dressed in all-black Galliano, Versace and Dolce & Gabbana, their eyes rimmed in inky kohl, emerge from Mr. Afanador's imagination, inspired by the fantastic tales told to him as a child. And photographed under the blinding sun, against the stark terrain of Andalusia, they assume enchanting qualities -- something that is not lost on them. ''I had a very defined image of my flamenco woman,'' Mr. Afanador wrote by e-mail from Granada, Spain, where his work is now on view. ''Amazingly, the women embraced it and allowed me to play with them as I would with a model. Some of them spoke of it as magic surrealism.''"

2009-10-18T00:00:00Z,"ASIDE from their carefree cool, there is a simple reason why the youthful, slightly coquettish side-swept hairstyles at Prada (left) and Alexander Wang (above) were the most talked-about looks at the recent fashion shows. ''They're attainable,'' said Guido Palau, the British hairstylist behind both of them. ''Women are attracted to that.'' Indeed, pigtails and a sporty Brooke Shields-circa-1980 side-braid are easy to achieve at home, but do they work on everyone? ''Well, you have to be a bit careful with the pigtails,'' Mr. Palau cautioned. ''Some women can adapt them into a ponytail with the front still swept teasingly to the side, but the braid can be very beautiful on older women. Look at Georgia O'Keeffe.''"

With washed leather flak jackets at Haider Ackermann (center left), olive-drab shirts at Balmain (below left) and tailored military tops at Celine (far left), a surplus supply of the stuff came marching down the Paris runways. And lately the French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld (seated) has been dressing like a drill sergeant in khaki-colored button-downs and an army-green parka. But, of course, the look is no new thing. Military style regularly appears, in some degree, on the runways. For this fall, Comme des Garçons sent out an array of fleece-lined military jackets and olive-drab coats. Dsquared did cargo pants. For more authentic and far less expensive options, there are Army-Navy stores, where the stylist Kate Young, an army fatigues devotee, has been shopping since she was a teenager."

Sack totals can be misleading, but in the last two games, the Jets have put little pressure on the quarterback, largely because they have failed to stop the run. In fact, Ryan noted that Buffalo had more sacks in one game (six, against Miami) than the Jets have this season. Help comes in the form of Buffalo's injured offensive line, which has yielded 18 sacks and had 9 false-start penalties last week. Worth noting: Buffalo fired the offensive coordinator Turk Schonert shortly before the season and replaced him with Alex Van Pelt."

The Giants (5-0) have a flashy record and a mostly healthy roster, but little idea of what they are capable of besides daisy stomping. Their three-week scrimmage did not have a major effect on the standings: the Philadelphia Eagles finish buttering the same three-team short stack this week. Of course, victories are not guaranteed against punching-bag opponents (see Giants-Browns last year), and the road to the Super Bowl is often paved with blowout victories against patsies. The Giants laughed through a similar stretch in 2007, beating four bad opponents by a combined score of 112-59. The brief downhill gave them the momentum needed to coast into the postseason."

Graduate of Exeter, Harvard College and Yale Law School, he was admitted to the New York Bar in 1937. He served in the army during World War II and the Korean War, primarily in Military Intelligence at the Pentagon. His active legal practice largely ended by 1947, when his father's death left him with primary responsibility for family real estate. He served for over fifty years in leadership roles in the Jewish Foundation for Education of Women and was active in the refugee field with the American Jewish Philanthropic Fund and the International Rescue Committee. Beginning as a book collector in 1963, what started as a hobby became a second career including service on Library Visiting Committees at Harvard and Stanford universities; mounting over thirty book exhibitions at libraries across the nation. Charles had a unique and imaginative approach to philanthropy. During his lifetime, he established several awards in a variety of institutions, and these were always named for people whose contribution to that particular institution was meaningful: The Hamilton Award at New York Hospital in White Plains; the Douglas Bryant Award at Harvard Library; the Miller Award at FEGS; the Fabrizio Michelassi Award for graduating Surgical Residents and Medical Students at Weill Cornell Medical School & New York Presbyterian Hospital; and the George Baer Award for medical students in the joint MD and MPH program at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

Indeed, millions of years ago, fear of predators would have been one of the forces that caused our ancestors to evolve to live in groups. The seeds of our social lives were watered with blood and nurtured by the roar of the lion and the claw of the leopard. More recently, however, it's been the case that the mammal most likely to kill a human is: a human. Murder and war have long been more important causes of death for us than predatory wild animals.

Their favorite places to stand are on the subway stairs, either at the top, bottom or halfway up; at times, they camp smack-dab in the middle of the sidewalk. Regardless of where these people choose to stop, they are all engaged in the same activity: talking on their cellphones. And while they chatter away, like statues newly bestowed with the gift of speech, the rest of us are obliged to perform something akin to interpretive dance to make our way around them. I had a close encounter with this new brand of boor this summer. Before even reaching the entry to the Woodhaven Boulevard subway station, I spotted her from a distance. As if glued to the top step and leaning against the steel railing, she was a textbook image of the cellphone user: oblivious to everything save the words she uttered and the ones coming from the stylish model she pressed firmly to her ear.

2009-10-18T00:00:00Z,"YOHE--Robert L.,died at his home in Bonita Springs, Florida on October 13 after a courageous battle with cancer. Born May 11, 1936 in Flushing, New York to Berdene (Walker) and Robert C. Yohe, he attended Baldwin High School on Long Island. After graduating from Lafayette College, he served in the Navy on the USS Bristol, where he was known as ""Grins"" to his shipmates. He achieved the rank of Lieutenant and upon discharge, entered Harvard Business School, graduating in 1964 with an MBA. His highly successful business career included executive management positions at Hooker Chemical, Uniroyal, Inc., and Olin Corporation. Bob was elected executive vice president and member of the board of directors of Olin in 1990. In 1993, he was named vice chairman of Olin and served in that capacity until his retirement in 1994. His corporate board service included Air Gas Corporation, Calgon Carbon Corporation, Albchem Industries Ltd., The Middleby Corporation and Marsulex Corporation. He served as volunteer chairman of the board of directors of the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association of Connecticut and chairman of the Connecticut Commission on Educational Excellence. In 1992, he returned to Lafayette College to serve as a member of the board of trustees where he dedicated himself to giving back to the institution that played such an important role in his life. He was vice-chair of the board of trustees from 2004 to 2007 and vice-chair of the 2004 presidential search committee. He played significant roles on numerous college committees, including investments, finance, career planning and placement, and information technology. Bob was devoted to mentoring students and helping others whenever he could. He is survived by his wife, Judith, and his stepchildren, William H. Huckins (Linda), Elizabeth Huckins Erwin (Matthew) and their children. When he lost his only brother and best friend, Thomas G. Yohe to pancreatic cancer in 2000, Bob, (affectionately known as ""UB"") became surrogate father to his nieces and nephews, Thomas E. Yohe, James R. Yohe, Lauren Yohe von Krusenstiern, Suzanne Yohe Tessitore, Colin R. Seely, Darren C. Seely and their 13 children who survive him. An avid golfer, Bob enjoyed annual trips with HBS classmates. He belonged to the Bonita Bay Club and the Royal Poinciana Golf Club in Florida. He and Judy maintained a summer home in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to be close to Lafayette College and belonged there to the Saucon Valley Country Club. Bob was both an inveterate bird hunter and dedicated conservationist. He enjoyed shooting quail over dogs in the South and driven birds in England. In the past few years he returned to an early passion hunting wild pheasants this time on the great plains of South Dakota. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, November 14 in Colton Chapel, Lafayette College, Easton, PA at 2:00pm. Memorial contributions may be made to the Robert L. Yohe '58 Scholarship Fund at Lafayette College or to Hope Hospice of Lee County, FL. We will all miss Bob very much."

2009-10-18T00:00:00Z,"Tarrytown, which sits high on a hill and has majestic views of the Hudson River, claims as a native son none other than Washington Irving, the author of ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' and other spooky tales. Its sister village, North Tarrytown, voted to rename itself Sleepy Hollow in 1996. So a visit to both villages is worthwhile, especially as Halloween looms and Irving's tales come to life -- at least in the imagination. Take the Hudson Line on Metro-North from Grand Central Terminal to Tarrytown. 10 A.M. Grab a cab at the train station and head to Philipsburg Manor, 381 North Broadway in Sleepy Hollow, (914) 631-3992, a national historic landmark. (Get a card from the driver; you'll need a ride back.) In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the manor was a farming, milling and trading complex. A visit ($12; $6 for children 5 to 17) is a trip back in time, complete with staff members in period costume, like the miller dressed in breeches and stockings who makes stone-ground corn. (A bag costs $3.) The farm also has historical breeds of oxen, cows and sheep, and you can tour the 300-year-old manor house and learn, among other things, the lesser-known story of slavery in the North. This weekend and next, the manor will hold special Halloween events for children, like pumpkin carving and the telling of ghost stories."

And nowhere has that production been more vital to a city's success than in New York. This documentary from Marc Levin examines the effect of the increased globalization of clothing manufacturing on the city's once-thriving garment district. The economic and social forces that have transformed the industry and the nation over the last century are explored through interviews with those who have experienced as many ups and downs as hemlines, including Fern Mallis, the creator of Fashion Week; the designer Isaac Mizrahi; Joe Raico, above, a fabric cutter; Irving Rousso, a rags-to-riches garmento; and Lisa Nussbaum, a cousin of Sadie Nussbaum, one of 146 people who died in the Triangle Shirtwaist fire of 1911. 7 P.M.

Graduate of Exeter, Harvard College and Yale Law School, he was admitted to the New York Bar in 1937. He served in the army during World War II and the Korean War, primarily in Military Intelligence at the Pentagon. His active legal practice largely ended by 1947, when his father's death left him with primary responsibility for family real estate. He served for over fifty years in leadership roles in the Jewish Foundation for Education of Women and was active in the refugee field with the American Jewish Philanthropic Fund and the International Rescue Committee. Beginning as a book collector in 1963, what started as a hobby became a second career including service on Library Visiting Committees at Harvard and Stanford universities; mounting over thirty book exhibitions at libraries across the nation. Charles had a unique and imaginative approach to philanthropy. During his lifetime, he established several awards in a variety of institutions, and these were always named for people whose contribution to that particular institution was meaningful: The Hamilton Award at New York Hospital in White Plains; the Douglas Bryant Award at Harvard Library; the Miller Award at FEGS; the Fabrizio Michelassi Award for graduating Surgical Residents and Medical Students at Weill Cornell Medical School & New York Presbyterian Hospital; and the George Baer Award for medical students in the joint MD and MPH program at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. He was an honorary member of the Grolier Club after 40 years of distinguished membership. He also enjoyed the conviviality of the Century, Harmonie, Harvard and Lotos Clubs in New York and the Book Club of California.

Probably not. After all, this was the way Favre looked early last season for the Jets, before he broke down. But when Favre rifled a 58-yard pass to Sidney Rice after the Baltimore Ravens had taken a lead late in the fourth quarter Sunday, he looked like the Favre of Green Bay vintage. Favre is completely at ease running the Vikings' offense. He had only 259 yards passing in Minnesota's 33-31 victory, but the Vikings are 6-0. Things will become a lot scarier if Adrian Peterson's ankle injury and Percy Harvin's bad shoulder limit them."

When he worked at the CERN physics laboratory in Geneva, colleagues tried to get him to speak French instead of English, in hopes of slowing him down. No surprise, then, that a half-hour dialogue with Mr. Berners-Lee, director of the World Wide Web Consortium and these days a professor at M.I.T., at a symposium last Thursday on the future of technology, fit that mold. I started, just for fun, with a historical question. If he were do it over again today, would he do anything differently? Any regrets?"

Mr. Ortved, 29, a self-described “comedy nerd,” who says he likes to laugh “more than the average person,” first pitched the idea of an oral history of the show when he was a 26-year-old editorial associate at Vanity Fair. ” ‘The Simpsons’ has been so influential that it is difficult to find a strain of television comedy that does not contain its bloodline,” Mr. Ortved said. Three years, 80 on-the-record interviews and one Vanity Fair article later, Mr. Ortved has produced a 300-page combination of juicy entertainment gossip, rich television history and notes from a disenchanted lover. Mr. Ortved recently spoke about the challenges of writing the book, the show’s legacy, Spider Pig and the possibility of a Simpsons Land theme park."

2009-10-20T11:30:04Z,"A short film starring the rapper Kanye West and directed by Spike Jonze has been taken down from Mr. West’s official Web site almost as quickly and mysteriously as it appeared. The film, “We Were Once a Fairytale,” is a 14-minute short that depicts a fictional version of Mr. West acting drunkenly and misbehaving in a club, having sex with a woman, vomiting and stabbing himself in the stomach to unleash an inner demon. (The metaphor-laden movie was made by Mr. Jonze, the director of “Where the Wild Things Are,” in January, before Mr. West’s misadventures at the MTV Video Music Awards in September.) The video popped up on kanyeuniversecity.com over the weekend, but it has since been pulled; a message on the Web site said only, “SORRY I HAD TO TAKE IT DOWN :(“"

In a news release, the companies said the first new books to be released under the partnership would include “All Things at Once” by Mika Brzezinski, the MSNBC anchor and co-host of “Morning Joe,” and a memoir and beauty guide by Raquel Welch, both planned for January, as well as “The Overnight Socialite” by the novelist Bridie Clark (“Because She Can”), which is scheduled for December.

The A.P. filed a countersuit in March, saying that Mr. Fairey misappropriated its rights to that image. On Friday, Mr. Fairey admitted that he lied in court papers about using a different photograph of Mr. Obama than the one The A.P. has alleged and that he created false documents to cover the discrepancy. In a statement, The A.P. said that Mr. Fairey “concocted” this latest explanation to “spin those bad acts in the best light possible to the court and the public.” In its filing, the news organization said, “It is simply not credible that Fairey somehow forgot in January 2009 which source image he used to create the Infringing Works, which were completed only a year earlier in January 2008.”"

Weill, the former Citibank executive, according to the hall’s most recent publicly available tax return. The firm, Iu and Bibliowicz Architects, was hired to help carry out a major expansion of Carnegie’s space into two towers above the hall complex. When the firm’s role was disclosed in October 2007, Carnegie declined to reveal the firm’s fee. Carnegie’s spokeswoman, Synneve Carlino, said on Tuesday that the $1.45 million included payments to subcontractors. She did not immediately provide the total amount paid to the firm for the continuing project. Mr. Weill has said he played no role in the selection of the firm of his son-in-law, Natan Bibliowicz. Carnegie officials defended the choice, and said they knew from the start about the relationship. The tax return also confirmed the lucrative aspect of being a stagehand. Dennis O’Connell, listed as a stagehand on the return and properties manager on Carnegie’s Web site (carnegiehall.org), made $530,044 in salary and benefits, which was reported by Bloomberg News. That was second only to the executive and artistic director, Clive Gillinson, who earned $946,581. Four other stagehands earned more than $400,000."

His other main post was a three-year stint as music director of the orchestra and opera at the Philharmonie de Lorraine in Metz, France.

2009-10-21T00:00:00Z,"The Associated Press said on Tuesday that it had filed a motion to amend its counterclaim against the artist Shepard Fairey and that his explanation Friday about which photograph he had used to create a poster of Barack Obama was “simply not credible.” Mr. Fairey, who created the widely seen “Hope” poster of Mr. Obama from a photograph taken for The A.P., filed a pre-emptive lawsuit in February against that news organization, saying that his use of the photograph was covered by fair-use rules. The A.P. filed a countersuit in March, saying Mr. Fairey misappropriated its rights to that image. On Friday, Mr. Fairey admitted that he lied in court papers about using a different photograph of Mr. Obama than the one The A.P. has alleged, and that he created false documents to cover the discrepancy. In a statement, The A.P. said that Mr. Fairey “concocted” this latest explanation to “spin those bad acts in the best light possible to the court and the public.” In its filing the news organization said, “It is simply not credible that Fairey somehow forgot in January 2009 which source image he used to create the infringing works, which were completed only a year earlier in January 2008.”."
2009-10-21T00:00:00Z,"A Swiss court denied Roman Polanski’s appeal on Tuesday to be released from jail pending a ruling on his possible extradition to the United States, The Associated Press reported. The Swiss Federal Criminal Court said Mr. Polanski, 76, was a “high” flight risk and rejected his offers to be under house arrest or to post bail, even if his chalet in Gstaad were used as collateral. He has 10 days to appeal the decision. Mr. Polanski, who fled the United States in 1978 before he could be sentenced for having sex with a 13-year-old girl, was arrested on Sept. 26 as he arrived in Zurich for a film festival. More court proceedings are expected after the United States files a formal extradition request, which must be submitted by Nov. 25."
2009-10-21T00:00:00Z,"For bands traveling to CMJ Music Marathon from abroad, making it to the gig is often not a completely sure thing. On Tuesday representatives of the Very Best, an African-British hybrid whose showcase was one of the most highly anticipated, confirmed that the group would not play at CMJ because Esau Mwamwaya, the Malawian singer who performs in the Very Best with a British D.J. duo, “ran into unfortunate travel circumstances.” A statement from the band’s label, Green Owl, did not explain further, but said that Mr. Mwamwaya had a United States visa. Green Owl’s Wednesday showcase will continue as planned with the D.J. duo as well as Theophilus London and others, the statement said. The British rapper Speech Debelle, below, who won the Mercury Prize this year, also had visa problems. She canceled her American tour, which included a showcase at the Music Hall of Williamsburg and at least three other CMJ appearances. In a statement, her British representatives said that “visa laws have just recently changed and delayed a few of our artists from getting their visas this fall.” Other acts forced to cancel their CMJ appearances this year because of visas issues include the Swedish band First Aid Kit and the British singer VV Brown."

So minus-7 yards, according to the passer rating formula, is superior to zero yards because recording minus-7 yards requires the actual completion of a pass. After the Giants routed the Oakland Raiders on Oct. 11, Giants linebacker Antonio Pierce compared the game to a scrimmage. The Raiders used that as bulletin-board material for their upset victory against the Eagles.

The National Security Archive in Washington said it was filing a Freedom of Information Act request on behalf of a coalition called the National Campaign to Close Guantánamo, including an effort to gain more details about how loud music was used as an interrogation device. Based on public documents and interviews with former detainees, the archive said, Guantánamo prisoners were played loud music, including songs by AC/DC, Britney Spears and Marilyn Manson, as well as advertising jingles and “Sesame Street” tunes, in their cells and in preparation for interrogations. Thomas Blanton, the executive director of the archive, told The A.P., “At Guantánamo, the U.S. government turned a jukebox into an instrument of torture.” A spokeswoman for Joint Task Force Guantánamo, which handles the care and custody of detainees, said loud music had not been used with prisoners since the fall of 2003."

This year, Agence France-Presse reported, the International Women’s Air and Space Museum in Cleveland put the sample on display, describing it as a strand of Earhart’s hair that had been recovered by a White House maid after the aviatrix, who was a friend of Eleanor Roosevelt’s, stayed there before her final flight. But DNA analysis revealed that it did not match other possessions of Earhart’s that were found on the Pacific island of Nikumororo. Earhart went missing over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during an attempted solo flight around the world. The thread still remains on display at the museum as part of an Earhart exhibition that runs through Nov. 15. “We’ve changed the sign and explained everything,” Heather Alexander, the museum’s manager, told Agence France-Presse, adding that visitors “show more interest and are very grateful that we are telling the truth and the whole story.”"

2009-10-22T00:00:00Z,"President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Wednesday began to unveil his new cabinet, a mix of well-respected professionals and political allies who analysts said would do little to increase the pace of change here. After Mr. Yudhoyono, a liberal former general, won re-election in a landslide victory in July, there was an expectation that he would fill his cabinet with technocrats who could tackle Indonesia's persistent problems, including graft, crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable judicial system. Instead, the president appears to have reserved only the economic posts for technocrats, while doling out others to members of the political parties that supported his re-election bid. For example, although Mr. Yudhoyono has emphasized the need for changes in the country's fractured justice system, he picked Patrialis Akbar, a career politician without reformist credentials, to run the important Ministry of Law and Human Rights."

Ounsworth played alone with an acoustic guitar, picking quietly reverbed arpeggios and singing a handful of his own songs along with the Blue Nile’s “Let’s Go Out Tonight,” the traditional “Moonshiner” and Chris Knox’s nicely barbed “A Song to Welcome the Onset of Maturity.” The songs were meditative, and they ran together; a series of reflections on being a perpetual stranger."

Around the same time, Mr. Cohen and his wife, Alexandra, loaned 20 artworks from their collection, which is estimated to be worth $750 million, for an exhibition at Sotheby’s. The two developments led some financial journalists and bloggers to speculate about whether Mr. Cohen might enjoy the perks of owning an auction house, and might be interested in taking Sotheby’s private.
