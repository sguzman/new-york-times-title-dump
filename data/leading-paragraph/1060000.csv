1904-04-02T00:00:00Z,"That story is a little disquieting which sets forth that the lady who is the chatelaine of the Russian Embassy in Washington has announced her intention to give some sort of entertainment for the benefit of the Russian Red Cross Society, and that some ladies of the Cabinet and of the President's family have announced their intention of assisting at this function."
1904-04-02T00:00:00Z,"The action of the Grand Jury in the matter of the Darlington collapse is something of a surprise. That ALLISON, the manager of the syndicate of owners, should have been deemed primarily culpable was to have been expected. The building seems to have been as he wanted it."
1904-04-02T00:00:00Z,"SANTOS-DUMONT'S story of his career as an enthusiast of aerial, navigation makes, especially in the earlier portion of the narrative, very good reading. Much of what he says has about it the air (no word-play is intended) of the man who does things."

1904-05-28T00:00:00Z,"The story of ""Dorothea"" gives contrasting pictures of a narrow, strait-laced Dutch community, and of the brilliant, complex Continental society that converges in Paris. Of this queen city of fascinations, the portrayal is wonderful. It literally rises ""like an exhalation"" from the pages.

1904-05-28T00:00:00Z,Alluding to a recent dispatch in THE TIMES Dr. Goldwin Smith remarks:
1904-05-28T00:00:00Z,The chief and most significant feature of a history of caricature must be the reproduction of skillfully and discriminatingly chosen specimens of what has been done by the most influential caricaturists.

1904-05-28T00:00:00Z,Barring the business in Detroit Southern yesterday's stock market was about as tame a performance as even the most violent opponent of excitement could possibly require.

1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"A reader of THE TIMES has asked for information about the duties of bank Directors in New York and the emoluments of their service. The query is a natural one in view of a banking situation like that in the financial district of the city, especially, and to a large extent in other parts as well, in which the majority of banks are individually known as belonging to some particular group or sphere of influence."

1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"SMALL HOSPITAL WARDS are the latest features among the comforts and conveniences of the shops in a big city. In some of the shops there are trained nurses always in attendance, and in others perfectly equipped doctors' offices, where all sorts and kinds of ailments are treated, minor surgical operations performed, and, in special emergency cases, future shoppers are assisted into the world amid surroundings eminently appropriate."
1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"The New York and Chicago teams gained a point on the Cincinnatis yesterday, although all three teams won. Cincinnati had a fairly easy time with the National League champions, but the New Yorks did not secure the victory from Brooklyn until the eleventh inning, while the Chicagos, after being outbatted, beat St. Louis by a run. At Philadelphia the Bostons won again from the locals by a score of 5 to 3."

1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"IN no part of the world has the woman spy been brought to the point so near perfection as in Europe, and it may be unhesitatingly said that in Russia, which fairly swarms with eyes and ears of the Czar, the dashing, beautiful woman, of high breeding and title, perhaps, has become the most necessary arm of that underground system which appears to read thoughts as well as detect designs."
1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"THE Japanese propensity for ""miniaturizing"" has of late led to experiments with many plants not native to the Flowery Kingdom, and as a result there are now shown heliotropes, impatiens, cacti, , from one and a half to four inches in height, which are not merely small examples of these different families, but wizened growths, of mature habits and proportion, perfect duplicates of the plants nature planned on a scale several hundred times larger."
1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"Whether or not the nice distinction between ""trading with"" bucket shops and ""trading for"" them will avail those members of the Stock Exchange who are under suspicion of being engaged in improper dealings, and who are said to have evoked this distinction in defense of their course, it is probable that the value of the technicality will be small in the eyes of disinterested observers."
1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"The Russian hope that Port Arthur would prove to be another Sebastopol must be becoming very dim. The conditions which enabled the Crimean fortress to hold out for nearly a year are lacking here -- the uninterrupted communication with the ""hinterland,"" the divided counsels and feeble action of the allies."

1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"In a market of the present character it seems very unlikely that there will be any well-defined line separating the busier Spring months from the less active period between June 1 and Oct. 1. Large real estate interests, both corporate and individual, are practically just where they have been for the last twelve months -- well loaded up with valuable properties."
1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"Criticised severely by dissatisfied stockholders of the company and apologized for by the friends of the management that prepared it, the recent annual report of the Corn Products Company seems to offer a striking example of accounting methods that are directly opposed to the recognized movement of the day toward fullness and accuracy in the statements submitted by the management of corporations to stockholders."

1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"ARTICHOKES will not be cheaper this season. Those from California are 10 cents each and the French ones sell at double the price. The cheaper variety is, as a rule, insipid and lacks the nutty quality of the imported, while it is palatable when served with a rich gravy sauce or a fine Hollandaise sauce, the flesh of the vegetable, or ""fond,' alone being used."
1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"""Anti-Cleric"" will never ""square"" anything if he does not go to the trouble of using his brains to do it. Any one with the smallest perception might see that Archbishop Mesmer's answer in regard to voting the Social Democratic ticket involved the relations between Socialism and the teachings of the Catholic Church, and consequently has nothing to do with Republican or Democratic principles, so there is really nothing to square."
1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, May 20. -- The success of ""Cynthia,"" which was produced at Wyndham's Theatre on Monday, was due entirely to the personal charm and capable acting of Ethel Barrymore and not to the merit of Hubert Henry Davies's play.

1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"The fact that The Times of London, which most Englishmen regard as a national institution and not merely as a newspaper, is to reduce its price 23 per cent. to subscribers has caused its rivals to comment upon its history of nearly 120 years. The most conspicuous tribute is evidently from the pen of Alfred Harmsworth, for it appears unsigned in his paper."
1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"LIKE many busy fathers, George A. Beaton, President of the American Finance and Securities Company, finds his keenest pleasure in talking and playing with his eight-year-old son, Bruce.

1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"HIGH-POWER automobiles of the present day present queer shapes. Especially is this true in the automobiles built solely for racing purposes.

1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"ALTHOUGH columns have been written about J. Henry Smith, who to-day is the wealthiest bachelor and the possessor of one of the most magnificent residences in New York, probably few remember that the late George Smith, who was the source of all this wealth, wrote a book upon finance which for years was regarded as an authority and which has its place yet in many club libraries."

1904-05-29T00:00:00Z,"The highly interesting editorial in today's TIMES on ""Snow on the Sidewalks"" beautifully illustrates the difficulty of putting nuisances out of the way along lines of certainly not abstract justice.

1904-06-17T00:00:00Z,"If in the platform it adopts the Democratic Convention at St. Louis altogether ignores the money question, its action will be construed as a sensible recognition of the fact that the currency is not an issue before the people. In the view of candid men that would be an ample recantation of the errors and heresies to which the party was committed under the fatal leadership of BRYAN.
