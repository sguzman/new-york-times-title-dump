2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"Is indie rock going spiritual? Last year's sensation, Arcade Fire, built an entire album around the idea of the funeral: the regret, the loss, the mystery and the life-goes-on. Now Band of Horses, a new group from Seattle that has a shimmering, guitar-drenched debut album, ''Everything All the Time'' (Sub Pop), also heads to the undertaker's for some rock 'n' roll salvation. The focal point of the record, the song ''The Funeral'' -- which, the band has said in interviews, is as much about death as it is about the dread of birthdays -- both soars and sulks, led along by sheets of electric guitars by Benjamin Bridwell (above, left) and Mat Brooke (right) that begin as teardrops and rise to majestic heights. ''At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral,'' Mr. Bridwell sings in a voice high and thin, an acceptance that sounds both glum and joyous. The band makes a sweep through New York-area clubs this weekend, with Mt. Egypt and the Can't See as opening acts.

Once you've made it to Rockland, halfway up the Maine coast along slow, winding Route 1, you're still a 75-minute ferry ride away. The ferry fits only 16 cars, and reservations are limited, so it's not unusual for motorists on a busy summer day to wait in line for two or even three of the six daily ferries to depart before securing a place on board. Once you're on the island, though, you are immediately aware of its natural beauty. It's a place of rocky shorelines, dense forests of pine and spruce, swooping sea birds and quiet, secluded coves."

This year's offerings (the festival runs through June 25) include the Renaissance ensemble Piffaro, playing music from Spanish and Portuguese cathedrals, and an evening of Bach cantatas and ''Brandenburg'' concertos to conclude the proceedings.

You'll find that very few historians endorse the opinion that Custer ever crossed the Little Bighorn or that he retreated. The battalion that crossed was led by Major Marcus Reno and he did indeed retreat, first to a stand of timber, and then across the river to the bluffs beyond. Custer led his battalion along the line of bluffs overlooking the river and, as far as can be determined, made only a feint toward the river at Medicine Tail Coulee. This was done with only a company or two of his five-company battalion. He then proceeded northward along the river before taking positions on Battle Ridge, at the northern end of which, on Last Stand Hill, the famous last stand was made. There is no proof that at any point in his own advance Custer was forced to retreat."

2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"Court Allows Evidence Despite Rule Violation The United States Supreme Court upheld the use at trial of evidence found by police officers who execute home search warrants without first following the constitutional requirement to ''knock and announce.'' The 5-to-4 decision left uncertain the value of the knock-and-announce rule, which dates to 13th-century England. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in the majority opinion that people subjected to an improper police entry were free to go to court and bring a civil rights suit against the police. But Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for the dissenters, said the court's ruling ''weakens, perhaps destroys, much of the practical value'' of the knock-and-announce protection. The decision followed a reargument less than a month ago, with the newest justice, Samuel A. Alito Jr., left, evidently casting the decisive vote.

2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"They're here, they're queer and they're celebrating life in the South Bronx and dance in general in this program of choreography by and for men. Presented tomorrow at 8 p.m. at the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, the event is part of ''Out Like That at BAAD!,'' an annual event during gay pride month. Arthur Aviles (above), one of eight featured choreographers on tomorrow's program, saw great possibilities in the South Bronx in 1999, when he began work on BAAD!, a center that he envisioned as a grass-roots locus for the arts and a home for gay artists and audiences. Life for gay people in the South Bronx was often not easy. The festival's title comes from a comment by a closeted gay man to the irrepressible Mr. Aviles that he was ''not out like that.'' Have things changed in the neighborhood? Mr. Aviles talks of being greeted with a kiss by a gay male friend on the street the other day, something that would not have happened five years ago. ''I guess I can speak for myself by saying that I feel protected by the macho men that I know in the area,'' he added. ''I honestly feel that the greeting the auto glass guys give to us every morning is warm.'' And is it now safe for boys to dance? Latino men have no problem with the salsa, he said, where they lead. ''Pointing one's feet could be looked at as suspect,'' he said. ''Suspect of what, you might ask? Well, maybe the answer lies in why we ask the question.''

The same principles, and much the same aesthetic, govern the Vision Festival, an annual summit of experimental music, art and dance being held this week at the Angel Orensanz Foundation for the Arts on the Lower East Side. Founded in 1996 by Patricia Nicholson Parker, a dancer whose husband, the bassist William Parker, is a Studio Rivbea alumnus, the Vision Festival has evolved into an impressively vibrant and well-organized affair. Fittingly, this year's edition bears a dedication to Mr. Rivers. Wednesday's program was billed as ""Lifetime Recognition: Sam Rivers Day."""

2006-06-17T00:00:00Z,"Despite the dwindling ratings for ''Game Show Marathon,'' the rest of CBS's tried-and-true Thursday lineup delivered the network a victory among total viewers. Reruns of ''CSI'' (11.1 million) and ''Without a Trace'' (10.4 million) compensated for ''Marathon,'' which brought in an audience of 6.8 million. But CBS placed third for the night among 18-to-49-year-olds, since younger adults preferred the N.B.A. finals on ABC and, second to that, Britney Spears's gum-chewing appearance on a special edition of NBC's ''Dateline.'' Basketball was broadcast live on ABC, and therefore its ratings were preliminary, but the overnight numbers showed that it drew a larger audience than Game 4 of last year's finals. NBC, which was third among viewers, showed repeats of ''My Name Is Earl'' (5.5 million) and ''The Office'' (5.1 million), ''Dateline'' (8.9 million) and the second episode of ''Windfall'' (7.8 million), the network's new scripted series. The lottery drama fell slightly from its premiere last Thursday, but beat ''Without a Trace'' at 10 p.m. in the 18-to-49 demographic. KATE AURTHUR"

2006-06-17T00:00:00Z,"MONTI--Tita. It is with great sadness that we announce the death of Tita Monti. Mrs. Monti, 85, a resident of Sands Point, NY, for more than 45 years, was an extraordinary woman with a generous heart and determination who revolutionized cancer care on Long Island. Just a few days after the 1972 death of her 16-year-old son Don Monti from myeloblastic leukemia, Tita and her husband, Joseph, founded the Don Monti Memorial Research Foundation. Over the past 34 years, it has raised more than $30 million for cancer research, education, fellowship and patient care. ''The idea was to bring the best of care to patients suffering from this dread disease,'' she said in a 1996 interview. ''That means top quality medical care as well as compassion. Our division is like a family, even though it has grown so big. From nothing, tremendous things have happened.'' In 1972, North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, NY, was a community hospital. With the Montis' support and leadership, its cancer programs grew by leaps and bounds. As the hospital grew, the Montis' support grew as well - in fact a pavilion, the Division of Oncology/Hematology, a research laboratory and the adult bone marrow transplant unit are all named in Don's honor. The Montis underwrote all administrative costs of the Foundation. Mrs. Monti was by no means a figurehead on the Foundation's letterhead. For nearly three decades, she came to her office at the hospital five days a week, overseeing all details of the Don Monti Memorial Research Foundation, both great and small. Her door was always open and patients often stopped by. Particularly close to Mrs. Monti's heart was the annual cancer Survivors' Day, which routinely attracts more than 2,000 attendees annually to celebrate life. Mrs. Monti was born Tita Scandalis in Pelham, NY, the daughter of Greek immigrants. She began playing piano as a child and performed at Carnegie Hall at the age of 11. Her singing voice matured and she became a dramatic soprano. She gave up piano to study and coach voice at the Juilliard School of Music. There, she met and married Joseph Monti, a tenor. Mrs. Monti taught school for a decade and then raised three children, Caroline, Don and Richard. Mrs. Monti was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera, a benefactor of Long Island University's Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, a member of the International Executive Board of Boys Town and Girls Town of Italy, and a member of the Board of Directors at LaSalle Center. During her lifetime, Mrs. Monti was recognized by many organizations for her outstanding contributions, including the Eleanor Roosevelt Community Service Award from New York State and the 1998 Ellis Island Medal of Honor Award. She also received a Doctorate of Humane Letters in recognition of her contributions to cancer care research, education and philanthropy. Mrs. Monti is survived by her husband of 62 years, Joseph, children Caroline Monti Saladino and Richard Monti, son-in-law Arthur Saladino, 10 grandchildren, six great grandchildren and sisters Bess Hatsis and Joan Tegtmeier.

With the Montis' support, North Shore University Hospital built a 10story pavilion and named its Division of Oncology/Hematology, a research laboratory and adult bone marrow transplant unit in Don's honor.

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"''DADA,'' heralded as the first museum exhibition in the United States to focus exclusively on this influential avant-garde art movement, opens at the Museum of Modern Art on Sunday, its last stop on a tour that began in Paris and included the National Gallery in Washington. The show's more than 400 works -- collage, montage, painting, film, photography, sound recordings -- were made from 1916 to 1924, as a response to World War I and the emerging glorification of machine culture. They reflect the many forms of Dada, including Zurich's experiments in radical abstraction, New York's readymades and machine portraits, Berlin's political montages, Cologne's hallucinatory dream imagery and Paris's critiques of painterly traditions. Among the nearly 50 artists represented are HANS ARP, KURT SCHWITTERS, MARCEL DUCHAMP, GEORGE GROSZ, MAX ERNST, MAN RAY and HANNAH HÖCH. Through Sept. 11. (212) 708-9400. MoMA's sister organization in Long Island City, Queens, the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, is about to unveil the winning project of the seventh annual MoMA/P.S. 1 Young Architects Program: it's an installation called ''BEATFUSE!,'' designed by the OBRA firm and opening on Thursday in P.S. 1's courtyard. Created by PABLO CASTRO and JENNIFER LEE, the design features seven curved, interconnected shells made of plywood and polypropylene mesh. Wooden tidal pools, water misters and a frigidarium -- using foil bubble insulation and ice -- will offer relief from the heat -- a blessing on Saturdays, when the courtyard is the site of the ''Warm Up'' summer dance parties. On view into September, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, (718) 784-2084. The COLONNA ALTARPIECE, painted by Raphael for a Perugino convent, was dismantled in 1663, its pieces scattered among several owners, including Queen Christina of Sweden, the Colonna family in Rome and the kings of Naples and the Two Sicilies. In 1901 the main panel and lunette were acquired by J. Pierpont Morgan for the startling sum of two million francs. Newspapers called it the most important painting to cross the Atlantic. Since 1916 it has been at the Met. An exhibition opening on Tuesday will reunite these pieces with the predella, the small narrative paintings that run along the bottom of the altarpiece. It will also display a group of Raphael's drawings and paintings produced around the time he painted the altarpiece. Through Sept. 3. (212) 535-7710."

The three companies named in that suit -- PEA Capital, PA Fund Management and PA Distributors, all owned by Allianz, which also owns Pimco itself -- settled the case a few months later, paying $50 million but neither admitting nor denying fault. Two executives named in the suit, however, pledged to fight."

But illegal off-road traffic cut utility lines to the beach in late May, forcing the town to delay its official opening at least until mid-July. The beach usually opens Memorial Day Weekend. All-terrain vehicles created deep trenches on town property, severing cables that provide electricity and telephone service to the park and making it impossible to staff the beach with a lifeguard, said Brian Pratt, the town parks commissioner. He said repairs would cost the town more than $40,000 and would take about a month to complete."

That will probably not surprise the residents of Greenwich, who have long been accustomed to a splashy mix of faiths in town. But it is worth recording as another small milestone in America's advancing tolerance. Greenwich, one of the nation's most patrician towns, was a place where by many accounts Jews were not always made to feel welcome as late as the 1950's. While Greenwich has long had synagogues, a day school is a more emphatic statement of Jewish arrival, because a school will perpetuate the teaching of Judaism for generations."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: George Saperstein (''How to Support Your Local Farmer,'' Op-Ed, June 11) has pinned the future of Connecticut agriculture on raising and killing animals for food. There's evidently no irony in saving farms by developing premium products for the consumers whose homes and S.U.V.'s sit atop what was recently prime farmland or natural habitat. Dr. Saperstein received almost $1 million from the Department of Agriculture to sell the idea of guilt-free meat. Playing on people's concerns about animals' living conditions has created a niche market for higher-priced meat, milk and eggs, but it also forestalls broader ethical considerations. Giving animals more space while alive cannot compensate for their lack of freedom and untimely deaths -- in taxpayer-financed slaughterhouses, if Dr. Saperstein got his way."

But if there's any justice in the world -- and if years of snot-and-poo jokes haven't deadened our collective funny bone -- this comedy about a Mexican monk who yearns to be a wrestler should make their reputation as two of our finest weapons of mass-comedy disquisition. The careers of these Southern California natives -- Mr. Black plays the tights-wearing monk and together they wrote the screenplay -- have been slow to boil. Mr. Black cut his teeth performing with the Los Angeles ensemble the Actors' Gang, making his feature-film debut as a wild-eyed conservative in Tim Robbins's satire ''Bob Roberts.'' In the years since, Mr. Black has employed those wild eyes to considerable comic effect in films like ''High Fidelity'' and ''The School of Rock,'' though not until now have his gifts as an actor, not just as a funnyman and stooge, been so blissfully evident. Mr. White, who wrote ''School of Rock'' for Mr. Black, once said of his rowdy friend, ''I think there's a sweetness to him that he's not able to show.'' There's more than a little sweet and sour to Mr. White, whose writing credits include both television (''Dawson's Creek,'' ''Freaks and Geeks'') and film (''Chuck & Buck,'' ''The Good Girl''). Like Mr. Black, a performer who happily lets his inner brat out to play and sometimes to rampage, Mr. White understands that there is both comedy and pathos in the divide between childhood and adulthood, and that what doesn't make you weep will surely make you laugh."

He was magnificently intelligent -- widely read in history, all branches of science, and fluent in four languages--yet he suffered fools gladly, always willing to buy someone a drink and listen with interest to their troubles. He was truly funny and generous to a fault, emptying his pockets for friends or complete strangers without hesitation. He liked to play cards, hearts and poker among his favorite games, bet the ponies, and could never resist a bowling alley. He also liked to fly-fish in Montana with his father and younger brother--to watch him cast a fly-rod was to know grace--but, like most things in life, even fishing failed to hold his interest for long, and he was apt to be found on the bank of the river, his fly-rod leaning against a shrub, his nose in a book.

Understandably, airlines want to monitor the consumption of alcohol onboard flights for reasons of safety and security."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"For New York voters who want to make informed decisions in November, this is an important week. The state legislative session is scheduled to end on Thursday, and there is an enormous agenda of unfinished business. As usual in Albany, everything is a tangled mess, with critical legislation lying boxed up in committee, or sitting in two completely different versions in the Assembly and Senate. A handful of powerful leaders, however, have the power to unwind just about anything if they care to do so."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"THE family farm is not dead in these parts. But it has been revised, perhaps by a well-to-do New Yorker or a land-rich Yankee. Nowadays, when you drive country roads, you are likely to spot strange and beautiful breeds, exotic livestock that exist, in some cases, as much for show as for consumption. Llamas and alpacas, which look like miniature camels, crane their necks over split-rail fencing and chew their cuds thoughtfully. Cream-white sheep grazing on brilliant verdured hillsides seem to have stepped out of a scene from Thomas Hardy -- and they have! -- since they are Cotswold sheep, imported from exclusive breeding stock in England. Gaudy peacocks and heirloom chickens race into the road, testing your brakes and patience."

As fans at the United States Open at Winged Foot Golf Club followed Tiger Woods (30), cheered Phil Mickelson (36), contemplated Colin Montgomerie (who will turn 43 on Friday) and tried to recall Steve Stricker (39), they held a glossy brochure with the day's pairings and a course map that contained a full-page bank advertisement featuring Donald."
2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"THE big spring ritual at our place just happened: the removal of the swimming pool cover. The exact date of this ceremony is determined by the pool guys, who cast runes to determine when, in exchange for a hefty financial tribute, they will deign to drop by and perform juju on the pipes, mutter incantations over the filter motor, and otherwise awaken the machinery whose continued function is the difference between a pool and a concrete-bottomed fen. But before this can happen, we have to remove the cover, a leaf-collecting tarp under which the pool hibernates all fall and winter, and top up the water level. We know that the time to do this is approaching when the weather, which had been giving hints of spring, suddenly turns cold and gray and dumps shower loads of new rainfall onto the cover, making it sag even more and adding extra broth to the slurry of leaf mold already fermenting there. Getting this gunk out is an extremely nasty job, and I try to leave it for my wife."
2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"CLEARED The News -- The special prosecutor in the C.I.A. leak case decided not to bring charges against Karl Rove. Behind the News -- Last fall, it seemed that an indictment on perjury charges was imminent for Mr. Rove, the president's senior adviser, as part of the leak investigation. The decision not to charge him eliminates a major distraction for the White House and allows Mr. Rove to focus on the midterm elections. But a cloud hangs over the executive branch: I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff and the only person charged in the investigation, is expected to go on trial on perjury and obstruction of justice charges in January. Mr. Cheney may be called to testify. PLEADED The News -- Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of prescription drugs. Behind the News -- Mr. Kennedy, 38, the son of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was sentenced to court-ordered drug treatment and probation in connection with a late-night car crash last month near the Capitol. After the accident he denied he had been drinking, announced he was addicted to prescription painkillers and checked into the Mayo Clinic for a month of treatment. For Mr. Kennedy, it was the latest in a long line of revelations of personal troubles; the effect on his standing among the voters of his home state is yet to be seen. APPEALED The News -- The Supreme Court made it easier for death-row inmates to challenge states on the issue of lethal injection. Behind the News -- The justices ruled in the case of Clarence E. Hill, above, a Florida inmate who had been scheduled for execution last January for the killing of a police officer. The court said Mr. Hill could challenge Florida's method of lethal injection under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, an appeals route with few obstacles. Death penalty opponents have questioned whether the drugs used eliminate pain. If not, they say, it is a cruel and unusual punishment. In their ruling, the justices gave no indication of where they stand on the issue. FREED The News -- Abu Bakar Bashir, an Islamic cleric linked to the bombings of two nightclubs in Bali three years ago, was released from an Indonesian prison. Behind the News -- American officials said they were disappointed in the release of Mr. Bashir, whom they consider to be an important operative for Al Qaeda. Mr. Bashir had served a little over a year of a 30-month sentence after being convicted of conspiracy in connection with the bombings, which killed 202 people. The judges in the case said Mr. Bashir knew the perpetrators and may have encouraged them. But as he returned to his hometown there were signs his influence may be waning: the crowd that welcomed him was far smaller than expected. SUED The News -- KFC was sued by a nutrition advocacy group seeking to have it stop using partially hydrogenated oils in its fried chicken and other foods. Behind the News -- The lawsuit by the Center for Science in the Public Interest came after the group had unsuccessfully petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to require warning signs in restaurants regarding use of the oils, a major source of trans fats, which nutritionists consider unhealthy. KFC said the suit was frivolous and that the company took health issues seriously. It said it was reviewing the use of alternative oils, but that maintaining the flavor of the original Colonel Sanders fried chicken recipe was important."

Mershon, assistant director in charge of the F.B.I.'s New York office, handed over a small steel pistol to Amy Verone, chief of cultural resources at Sagamore Hill.

His first trip, in 2003, began and ended under cover of darkness and was confined to a military base at the Baghdad airport. Last week, Air Force One landed in the afternoon, and Mr. Bush traveled by helicopter over insurgent strongholds to the safety of the Green Zone in the city center. Still, the visit was a secret even to the Iraqi Prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, until shortly before Mr. Bush's arrival. Both of his trips lasted only a few hours."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"WHEN leaders of the Sri Venkateswara Hindu temple in Bridgewater gathered last month for another public hearing on their proposal for a larger cultural center, they felt confident that the township's Zoning Board of Adjustment would approve a variance for it at long last. Two previous series of contentious hearings had ended in ''no'' votes. The first led the temple to take the township to court. At the second, the board approved requests for an expansion of the temple itself and construction of homes for priests, but not for the cultural center."
2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"THE family farm is not dead in these parts. But it has been revised, perhaps by a well-to-do New Yorker or a land-rich Yankee. Nowadays, when you drive country roads, you are likely to spot strange and beautiful breeds, exotic livestock that exist, in some cases, as much for show as for consumption. Llamas and alpacas, which look like miniature camels, crane their necks over split-rail fencing and chew their cuds thoughtfully. Cream-white sheep grazing on brilliant verdured hillsides seem to have stepped out of a scene from Thomas Hardy -- and they have! -- since they are Cotswold sheep, imported from exclusive breeding stock in England. Gaudy peacocks and heirloom chickens race into the road, testing your brakes and patience."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"A NEW exhibition at the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University details the life of Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the aviator, author and wife of Charles A. Lindbergh, in letters, photographs and books. The show, which opened last week, marks the first time Yale's collection of Mrs. Lindbergh's papers has been displayed. The exhibition also marks another milestone: If she were still alive, Mrs. Lindbergh, who died in 2001, would have turned 100 on June 22. Mrs. Lindbergh and her husband gave their letters and other historical materials to Yale, said Judith A. Schiff, the chief research archivist at the Yale University Library and the show's curator. The items in the one-room show on Mrs. Lindbergh, which runs through Sept. 8, were culled from more than 300 boxes of materials, Ms. Schiff said."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Jay Jennings begins his review of my book, ''Horsemen of the Esophagus: Competitive Eating and the Big Fat American Dream'' (May 28), by noting that my surname sounds ''like pasta'' -- a cheap ethnic joke that I'm surprised got past a phalanx of editors at the nation's paper of record. Jennings even hits the joke twice, referring to my book as the one that's written ''by the pasta.'' If Colson Whitehead had written a book about Southern cuisine, would you have let Jennings write that his name reminds him of a bowl of chitlins? Apart from being snide, the review doesn't begin to cover the bases. My book -- which was excerpted in The Atlantic Monthly -- is paired with another about eating contests that was written with very different intentions, even if both books did feature pictures of hot dogs on the cover. The problem with pairing the two books is that the generalizations that follow are baffling. Jennings knocks both of us for ''mostly'' avoiding questions of ''nationalism, racism, psychology and physiology'' because we don't have the requisite ''chops.'' I won't speak for the other book, but the middle third of ''Horsemen'' begins with a four-page interview with a prominent psychologist from the University of Pennsylvania and goes on, over the next hundred pages, to discuss the nationalistic overtones and class implications of a specific eating contest in Philadelphia. I also have an entire chapter on the physiology of eaters, featuring interviews with top gastroenterologists at Stanford University, Thomas Jefferson University and the Cleveland Clinic. The chapter is 20 pages long. It should have been pretty hard for Jennings to miss. My book centers on people who eat hot dogs for a living, but that doesn't mean it needs to be reviewed in the spirit of an especially boorish drive-time D.J. In assigning the review to a writer more interested in making smug jokes than engaging what I actually wrote, it appears that The Times was judging the book by its cover. Jason Fagone Philadelphia"
2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"WHEN leaders of the Sri Venkateswara Hindu temple in Bridgewater gathered last month for another public hearing on their proposal for a larger cultural center, they felt confident that the township's Zoning Board of Adjustment would approve a variance for it at long last. Two previous series of contentious hearings had ended in ''no'' votes. The first led the temple to take the township to court. At the second, the board approved requests for an expansion of the temple itself and construction of homes for priests, but not for the cultural center."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"Summer is in the air, so it's probably only appropriate that many coming dance events concern heat and light. KIMBERLY BARTOSIK's ''HOME IN THE NEON HEAT'' involves both. A collaboration between Ms. Bartosik, a former Merce Cunningham dancer, and the lighting designer RODERICK MURRAY, the production divides space with light so that the audience beholds a fractured landscape filled with brief, physically intense and emotionally hot movements evoking a divided society and a world broken by war.

Nearly every subdivision announces its presence with a rustic wooden or stone sign. The ritualistic naming of planned communities is nothing new -- anyone living in a Levittown knows that.

So who is coming up with new ones? And is there a point?"
2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"Baseball has always been one of the least theatrical sports. Though there are occasional heart-stopping moments, in general the game's staging is static, with most of the players sitting or standing still for long periods; the action starts and stops; and compared with, say, basketball or soccer, the ensemble acting (otherwise known as teamwork) is minimal. Even one of the game's great achievements, a no-hitter, celebrates the pitcher's ability to send the batter offstage without doing much. Yet whether it's the metaphorical potential, the cultural status or the off-field drama, baseball has long been a theatrical favorite, from ''Damn Yankees'' to Richard Greenberg's ''Take Me Out.'' On Saturday seven writers will present their takes on the sport at the SEVENTH INNING STRETCH festival, an evening of 10-minute plays about baseball held by the Mile Square Theater in Hoboken, N.J. A baseball series makes sense for this town, which claims to be the site of the first officially recorded baseball game in 1846. (For the record the New York Base Ball Club defeated the Knickerbockers 23-1.)

Another soldier was killed in the attack. 10 A new criminal investigation into the killings of three Iraqis by American servicemen north of Baghdad last month has been set in motion by soldiers who alerted military officials that higher-ranking soldiers had caused the deaths of the men, according to government officials. 10 Chechen Leader Reported Killed Russian special forces killed the leader of Chechnya's separatists, officials said, reveling in a new blow to a rebel movement with a long history of terrorist attacks that has recently appeared seriously weakened. 6 Still No Salaries in Gaza Palestinians in Gaza are struggling to cope in the fourth month without salaries from the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority. 8 Rebels Clash With Sri Lanka Fighting between Sri Lankan government forces and Tamil Tiger rebels escalated sharply with as many as 47 people killed. 12 Serbia Genocide Case Goes On While the death of Slobodan Milosevic brought an end to his trial at the United Nations war crimes tribunal, the question of whether genocide occurred during his rule may be decided by another United Nations court based in The Hague: the International Court of Justice. 6 Diplomatic Definitions for Iran The international initiative to curb Iran's nuclear program hinges on a request that Tehran freeze all uranium enrichment activities before talks can begin.

Between noon and 4:30 p.m., for example, you might find yourself shuttling between Coe Hall, where EDWARD ARRON, the cellist, and JEEWON PARK, the pianist, play all of Beethoven's Cello Sonatas, and the Horticultural Center, where members of the Knights Ensemble begin an afternoon of chamber works with the ''Ghost'' Trio and the Quintet for Piano and Winds. The seven-hour festival includes an orchestral concert, at 5, in which the pianist JEROME ROSE will be the soloist in the Concerto No. 3, and the KNIGHTS ENSEMBLE, led by ERIC JACOBSEN, plays the Fourth Symphony.

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"TO what extent is William Kentridge, the South African illustrator, filmmaker and theater set designer, a political artist? At first glance his printmaking, the subject of a touring survey at the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers, suggests something out of a Sergei Eisenstein epic: withering black and white imagery of the poor and downtrodden, satirical attacks on bourgeois society. But since Mr. Kentridge's international art world debut in 1997, at the Documenta X survey in Kassel, Germany, he has become one of the darlings of cravat-wearing collectors, curators and art world kingpins. Now 51, he exhibits with the choosy Marian Goodman Gallery in Manhattan, and his animated films have swiftly earned a place in museum collections."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"VAN BUREN--James Martin II. Died at the age of 79, this past Monday, June 12, 2006, from natural causes at St. Vincents Hospital. He was preceded in death by his wife Margaret Ellen in 1999, and son Edward (Ted) in 1993. He is survived by a son Martin (Matt), daughter Katrina Van Buren Claghorne, son-in-law Edward, two grandsons, Justus and Edward, and other extended family members. After serving in the Navy and traveling extensively in Europe, he joined Time Life Corp. and its internationally influential Look Magazine division, spending a number of years on assignments in London and Tokyo among other countries overseas. Afterwards in Manhattan, he was involved in establishing the first financial printing division for R. R. Donnelly & Sons and Scott Printing Corporation where he remained for over 25 years, and finally with Command Financial Press. The great loves in his life beyond his family were Colgate University where he graduated in 1950, the Holland Society in NYC where he served in various leadership positions for over two decades, Kane Lodge No. 454, Free and Accepted Masons, and the traditional Martin Van Buren/ Rooseveltian/Democratic Party politics of Greenwich Village and upstate New York. Being a collateral descendant of President Martin Van Buren, Jim was an active supporter of the Martin Van Buren Museum in Kinderhook, NY. A funeral service will be held on Tuesday, June 20, at 12:45 PM, at Grace Church, 10th Street and Broadway, NYC. In lieu of flowers donations can be made to either the Kane Lodge Foundation or the Grace Church memorial fund. $(6$)VAN BUREN--James Martin II. Kane Lodge #"

Both professional tours have their female counterparts, but the prize money is different. The reason is that more people are drawn to the men's tours, which translates into more prize money."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"THE family farm is not dead in these parts. But it has been revised, perhaps by a well-to-do New Yorker or a land-rich Yankee. Nowadays, when you drive country roads, you are likely to spot strange and beautiful breeds, exotic livestock that exist, in some cases, as much for show as for consumption. Llamas and alpacas, which look like miniature camels, crane their necks over split-rail fencing and chew their cuds thoughtfully. Cream-white sheep grazing on brilliant verdured hillsides seem to have stepped out of a scene from Thomas Hardy -- and they have! -- since they are Cotswold sheep, imported from exclusive breeding stock in England. Gaudy peacocks and heirloom chickens race into the road, testing your brakes and patience."

He was a prominent engineer who, among many other important projects, participated in the design of Sputnik--the first man - made object launched into space. His life was deeply connected to the fate of his beloved city, Leningrad, in which he lived for over four decades. His heroic behavior during the historic 900 day siege of Leningrad was recognized by a medal, ''For the Defense of Leningrad,'' awarded to him at the end of World War II. He immigrated to the United States in 1979. He is survived by two sons and their spouses, Dimitry Poretsky and Anne Schroeder of Laguna Beach, CA, and Dr. Leonid Poretsky and Tony DiCarlo of Manhattan.

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"THE big spring ritual at our place just happened: the removal of the swimming pool cover. The exact date of this ceremony is determined by the pool guys, who cast runes to determine when, in exchange for a hefty financial tribute, they will deign to drop by and perform juju on the pipes, mutter incantations over the filter motor, and otherwise awaken the machinery whose continued function is the difference between a pool and a concrete-bottomed fen. But before this can happen, we have to remove the cover, a leaf-collecting tarp under which the pool hibernates all fall and winter, and top up the water level. We know that the time to do this is approaching when the weather, which had been giving hints of spring, suddenly turns cold and gray and dumps shower loads of new rainfall onto the cover, making it sag even more and adding extra broth to the slurry of leaf mold already fermenting there. Getting this gunk out is an extremely nasty job, and I try to leave it for my wife."

The story left me wondering who's the boss when the ''dreams'' of a prepubescent child can so control and divide her family?

THE grouping of Beethoven's last three piano sonatas makes more sense to concert programmers and record-company executives than it does to the inquiring ear. The opus numbers (109, 110, 111) are all in a row. And together the pieces fill a recital nicely or fit comfortably onto a single CD, as they do with Mitsuko Uchida's new release on the Philips label. Yet each piece is so different from the others, and each is such a tremendous earful of music in itself, that it may thrive more fully given space and isolation."

Anthony Baratta, who is famous -- or infamous -- for the wildly colored, pattern-on-pattern, object-stuffed apartments he designed for himself in Greenwich Village and Miami Beach, has a brand-new pad. And here, in a 1,600-square-foot apartment in a renovated industrial building in Chelsea, he has toned things down. Way down. Of course, there are still the Classical statues (although not nearly as many), clashing patterns and confident juxtapositions of Victorian and modern furniture for which Baratta and his design partner, William Diamond, are so well known. But where there was once heat, there is now cool. The out-every-night provocateur has traded in his hot pink Gucci shirts and black calf's-hair coats for a more domesticated existence -- and for camel's hair, flannel and tweed. That goes for the upholstery too."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"The upstairs galleries of the Beaux-Arts-style wing of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, completed in the early 20th century, have never been so appropriately adorned as they are now, with the paintings that make up ''American Splendor: Hudson River School Masterworks'' -- a glorious, robust assemblage of 120 works by artists from a movement that defined 19th-century American landscape art. Those who follow American art will find few surprises here, but will be rewarded with excellent examples of every major artist's work, all drawn from the Wadsworth's permanent collection. For others less well versed, the show offers a superb overview of the movement. Probably the simplest indication of the originality and importance of the Hudson River School artists is the extent to which they changed the way we see the American landscape. Threatening visions of an untamed wilderness filled 18th- and early-19th-century landscape art, but the Hudson River School painted a more benign country --ripe for exploration and settlement."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,To the Editor: Your May 28 editorial ''A Hit or an Error?'' suggests that Gov. Jon Corzine ''take a hard look'' at the plans for a minor league ballpark in Bergen County. I invite him to do that -- just as the Bergen Cliff Hawks did with a comprehensive feasibility study. He'll find what we did: that Bergen County is hungry for affordable family entertainment. You also express concern about committing ''scarce public money'' to this project. But the public won't build the ballpark at Xanadu. The owners of Xanadu will build it as they promised when they sought to persuade the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority that Xanadu was more than just an oversize mall.

New also was the fully restored pavilion, top left, and the president, Scot D. Medbury, above, with Elizabeth Scholtz, a former director. The evening raised $370,000."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"I enjoyed Wendy McClure's True-Life Tale (June 4) that chronicled the less-than-enthusiastic reception Brian Eno's ''Thursday Afternoon'' received in Rossi's, ''an amiable dive bar.'' I am concerned, however, that readers unfamiliar with Eno's work might accept the reaction of the bar's patrons as informed and legitimate criticism. In that setting, Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations would have evoked a similar response. '' Thursday Afternoon'' is an organically complex work best experienced through a quality sound-reproduction system, in an environment without intrusive noise that would obscure the myriad intricate details suspended through the recording's dynamic range. McClure's ''Ting . . . ting. . .ting . . .'' characterization of the piece, while not inappropriate in context, is analogous to reducing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony to ''da-da-da-DUM''; there's really quite a lot lost in the process. I hope your readers will not leave the denizens of Rossi's with the last word on this quietly sublime music. Randy Walters Bristol, R.I."

A caring and ceaselessly energetic individual, Dr. Diehl found great joy in extending warmth and concern to the patients and families that The Institute served.

She received her medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1950 with the distinction of being the first woman to rank at the top of the graduating class. She completed an internship at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis and residency training at The New York Hospital. Following her medical training, Dr. Diehl directed the Nursing Health Service at The New York Hospital for more than 20 years. She worked as an internist at the Hypertension Center/Physician Practice Plan with Dr. John Laragh before joining The Rogosin Institute in 1983. Dr. Diehl is survived by husband, Albert L. Rubin, M.D., mother, Estelle Diehl, son, Marc Rubin, M.D., daughter-in-law, Jennifer, brother, John Diehl and grandchildren, Sara, Matthew and Bryan. Funeral services are private.

It's worth noting that on the cover, that iconic shot of John Wayne holding one arm in the other, from the closing scene of the film, was a nod to a great western star of the 1910's and 20's, Harry Carey. That was his trademark pose, and he was Ford's first great collaborator. Wayne at that very moment was facing Carey's widow, Olive, who played Mrs. Jorgensen in the film. Loren Schoenberg Bronx"
2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"WHEN leaders of the Sri Venkateswara Hindu temple in Bridgewater gathered last month for another public hearing on their proposal for a larger cultural center, they felt confident that the township's Zoning Board of Adjustment would approve a variance for it at long last. Two previous series of contentious hearings had ended in ''no'' votes. The first led the temple to take the township to court. At the second, the board approved requests for an expansion of the temple itself and construction of homes for priests, but not for the cultural center."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"There is a lot going on in Atlanta in December 1939. The long-awaited movie ''Gone With the Wind'' is having its premiere, which means, as Lala Levy points out, that ''Clark Gable is less than five miles from this house this very second.'' Ballyhoo is right around the corner. That's a gala end-of-the-year celebration attended by German Jews, not ''the other kind,'' as several characters refer to Jews from Russia or Eastern Europe. And of course it's Christmas. There is a prettily decorated tree in the living room, and Boo Levy says it's fine, except for the star on top, which, for a Jewish household, may be a little too direct a reference to Jesus' birth. Never mind that Lala is singing ''Noel'' as the play begins. There are stories in the newspaper about the trouble in Europe (''This Hitler business in Poland -- ain't gonna turn out good,'' says the one member of the household who seems to read a newspaper). But that unpleasantness will be studiously ignored by most of the characters in ''The Last Night of Ballyhoo,'' the Schoolhouse Theater's final offering of the season."

Nowadays, when you drive country roads, you are likely to spot strange and beautiful breeds, exotic livestock that exist, in some cases, as much for show as for consumption. Llamas and alpacas, which look like miniature camels, crane their necks over split-rail fencing and chew their cuds thoughtfully. Cream-white sheep grazing on brilliant verdured hillsides seem to have stepped out of a scene from Thomas Hardy -- and they have! -- since they are Cotswold sheep, imported from exclusive breeding stock in England. Gaudy peacocks and heirloom chickens race into the road, testing your brakes and patience."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"What's a fence between good neighbors? To the United States government in considering Mexico, it's sophisticated but pretty straightforward: the plans may incorporate so much high technology that the fence is more virtual than real, but in the end it is an imposing barrier, intended to repel, not attract. To architects and designers, such a fence poses a different challenge, but one they often face in their line of work: making the unwelcome welcoming. William L. Hamilton, a reporter for The New York Times, asked a handful of designers to devise a fence for the border. Their disparate visions are depicted on Page 14."

''Right there,'' he said, gesturing toward the finger of tidal water that separates the new river walk along the edge of Constable Hook from the abandoned military base on the next peninsula to the north.

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In their letters to the editor of the Book Review, James Walling (April 30) and Morris Dickstein (May 7) are right to enter their qualifications about my review of Frederick Brown's biography of Flaubert (April 16), but I think a demonstrable case can still be made for Flaubert as a founder of the modern novel -- and, as I added in my review, of many kinds of modern narrative. Our indebtedness, whether we like it or not, extends to, among other things: the fetishizing of visual detail; the inverted relation between background and foreground detail (or habitual and dynamic detail); the sacralization of art; the privileging of the music of style over the recalcitrance of ''unmusical'' subject matter (Flaubert's famous desire to write a book about nothing); the agonizing over aesthetic labor -- all this looks pretty new, and different in many ways from Balzac's great achievements and solutions, not least because these new Flaubertian anxieties cannot be solutions. You might say that Flaubert founds realism and simultaneously destroys it, by making it so aesthetic: fiction is real and artificial at once. And I could have added two other elements of modernity: the refinement of ''free indirect style''; and the relative plotlessness of Flaubert's novels. All this is why different writers -- realists, modernists and postmodernists -- from Stephen Crane to Ian McEwan, from Kafka to Nabokov to Robbe-Grillet, all owe so much to Flaubert, and have been so keen to lay claim to different novels of his. I don't at all disagree with Dickstein's caveat that Flaubert's obsession with form, rhythm and ''the sentence'' inaugurates a potentially sterile aestheticism; I once wrote an essay, ''Half Against Flaubert,'' in which I said exactly that. I also agree that there are wonderfully messy writers like Dreiser and Hardy who, by Flaubertian standards, are beyond the aesthetic pale, and shouldn't be. My claim for Flaubert's primacy wasn't evaluative but factual: personally, I'm of two minds, or two hearts, about Flaubert. Henry James's devoted recoil from Flaubert's aestheticism (the devotion of an aesthete, the recoil of a moralist) seems the right response. James Wood Cambridge, Mass."

He later became CFO of Quarex, a company he personally took public on the NASDAQ. Lenny's life in New Jersey was rich and full with so many cousins that were really dear friends. Ten years ago Lenny retired with Irene to Boca Raton where he greatly enjoyed golf, tennis, the beach club, bridge, poker, watching the stock market, opera, theater, restaurants, movies and world travel, always surrounded by his many wonderful friends and loving children.

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"There is a plethora of Father's Day programming on Sunday, but most of it isn't Oscar-winning. At 8 p.m. CINEMAX will present JOHN CANEMAKER's half-hour film ''THE MOON AND THE SON: AN IMAGINED CONVERSATION,'' which won the Academy Award for best animated short earlier this year. It's not so much a tribute to Mr. Canemaker's Italian-American father, who died in 1995, as it is a psychodrama, an effort to work out a troubled father-son relationship posthumously. The animated figures include Nazis, 1950's policemen, Mafiosi here and abroad and a few cute sheep. ELI WALLACH and JOHN TURTURRO do the voices. NBC, wondering how it could imitate Fox's überhit series, ''American Idol,'' but change it just enough to give it another title, has come up with ''AMERICA'S GOT TALENT,'' which has its two-hour premiere on Wednesday night at 9. The difference is that aspiring dancers, comedians and other performers -- not just singers -- will compete. But where are they going with this casting? The host is REGIS PHILBIN. The judges are DAVID HASSELHOFF, the singer BRANDY and, presumably in the Simon Cowell role, PIERS MORGAN, a British newspaper editor and television host. Sometimes the PBS series ''HISTORY DETECTIVES'' does rattle on a little too much about its subjects. Do we really need to know the entire history of the cowboy profession while experts track down the truth behind a Chisholm Trail historical marker in a small Texas town? But in general, these investigations are highly satisfying emotionally. The fourth-season premiere (Monday at 9 p.m.) also looks into the history of a Houdini poster (the owner ends up with a program from that particular show) and a 45-star American flag that may have draped the coffin of President William McKinley after his assassination in 1901. That search ends up at a grave, but not McKinley's."

The exact date of this ceremony is determined by the pool guys, who cast runes to determine when, in exchange for a hefty financial tribute, they will deign to drop by and perform juju on the pipes, mutter incantations over the filter motor, and otherwise awaken the machinery whose continued function is the difference between a pool and a concrete-bottomed fen. But before this can happen, we have to remove the cover, a leaf-collecting tarp under which the pool hibernates all fall and winter, and top up the water level. We know that the time to do this is approaching when the weather, which had been giving hints of spring, suddenly turns cold and gray and dumps shower loads of new rainfall onto the cover, making it sag even more and adding extra broth to the slurry of leaf mold already fermenting there. Getting this gunk out is an extremely nasty job, and I try to leave it for my wife."

Mr. McGraw knows his way around a big, sentimental ballad (he proved it again with his blockbuster 2004 single, ''Live Like You Were Dying''), but his current hit is something of a surprise: a cover of ''When the Stars Go Blue'' by the alt-country divo Ryan Adams.

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"MERRILL - Philip. Cornell University mourns the loss of devoted alumnus, Philip Merrill, a champion of education who created the Merrill Presidential Scholars Program at the university, whereby exceptional Cornell seniors recognize the high school and Cornell teachers who inspired them. He also provided generous scholarships to financially needy students. Mr. Merrill recently funded Cornell University's Merrill Family Sailing Center on Cayuga Lake in Ithaca, NY, which, when it is built, will commemorate his love of sailing and Cornell. A member of the Class of 1955 as well as a renowned international statesman, adviser to U.S. and Cornell presidents, publisher with a commitment to public service, distinguished banker, and civic minded entrepreneur, Phil Merrill brought experience, distinction and vision to his roles as Cornell trustee, presidential councillor, and member of University Council. His entrepreneurial spirit helped guide the Johnson Graduate School of Management Advisory Council. Cornell University expresses its sincere condolences to his wife Eleanor, his son Douglas, his two daughters Cathy and Nancy, and four grandsons.

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"Michael Pollan (The Way We Live Now, June 4) gets it right when he writes that organic agriculture's future production will be outsourced to countries where it is cheaper to grow crops without chemical inputs. The reason growing organic crops is cheaper in other countries is the availability of workers at cheap wages to pull weeds by hand out of crop fields. Pollan suggests that tens of thousands of organic corn acres would be required to meet the needs of a world thirsty for corn syrup. He's wrong there. Tens of millions of acres would be required. A vast expansion in organic acreage will sentence millions of low-paid workers around the world to a life of drudgery pulling weeds so that Americans can sip an organic drink. Seventy years ago, almost a quarter of the U.S. population lived on farms and millions of people hoed weeds all summer. Thanks to herbicides like atrazine, those days are long gone. In the U.S., chemical herbicides do the work of 30 million laborers. Without a vast infusion of migrant workers and a significant lowering of the wage rate, growing crops with organic methods has a very limited future in the U.S. Leonard Gianessi Director, Crop Protection Research Institute CropLife Foundation Washington"
2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"IN the fall of 1992, a woman was in her apartment on West 16th Street in New York City when her boyfriend walked in with a gun pointed at him. The gunman had pistol-whipped him in the vestibule and taken his keys. Once in the apartment, he forced the woman to go around collecting money and jewelry. Forcing her boyfriend to watch, the gunman then raped her twice."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"A few days after the Boys and Girls Club of Northern Westchester announced that it was shutting a summer program for hundreds of children from low-income families, Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, announced on Thursday that the county would give $100,000 to the program in an effort to save it. The camp, operated out of the Community Opportunity Center in Tarrytown, is one of the few programs in affluent Westchester that caters to low-income families. But since its opening in 2002, the camp has accumulated a deficit of about $400,000, and earlier this year, unable to cope with a rent increase, the camp was asked by the center to leave by the end of this month."
2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"IT was a small gesture, worth little or nothing in dollars and cents. A legally married gay couple still has to pay $150 for a family pass to a Westchester County pool, exactly what two unattached straight adults pay. But they qualify as a family -- and that is another milestone for gay residents of Westchester. A county shaped around the needs of families declared this month that gay people married in Massachusetts or one of a handful of countries, like Canada and the Netherlands, that accept gay vows are a family too, at least for the humdrum purposes of using the county's parks or shelters."

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In his review of Phillip Lopate's anthology ''American Movie Critics'' (June 4), Clive James, wanting to demonstrate to critics how to ''take down'' a film they don't like, pans ''Munich.'' He accuses the film's writers of not knowing ''half enough about politics.'' No instances of our semi-ignorance are provided; not one line of the script is cited. Instead, a single scene is mentioned: a meeting of Golda Meir's ''cabinet'' -- it obviously wasn't a cabinet meeting, but never mind -- which, James writes, ''went for nothing.'' And that's it. I know film critics everywhere will profit from James's instruction. He may even enlighten the many who wrote admiringly of ''Munich,'' including the three film critics of The New York Times. I, having been taken down, will run for cover in a moment, but first I would like to respond to James's devastating analysis. I do so know more than half enough! And, furthermore, that scene went for something! Since ''Munich'' isn't mentioned in the anthology, his attack isn't merely vague, it's utterly gratuitous. After using up an awful lot of paper and ink sharing his opinions of real film critics, James exposes himself as the sort of writer who slags the people behind the art because he can't summon the substance or wit to articulate his unhappiness with the art itself -- or, I suspect, in the case of ''Munich,'' with the politics he feels the art expresses. That's the difference between a critic and a crank. Tony Kushner New York"

He died peacefully at home surrounded by some of his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, as well as his beloved companion of eight years, Judy, and her daughter Sandy. He was in excellent health for 100 years, going to work six days a week until three weeks ago.

We will all miss him dearly. He was married for 54 years to Ann until her demise. His daughter Bascia predeceased him.

Nearly every subdivision announces its presence with a rustic wooden or stone sign. The ritualistic naming of planned communities is nothing new -- anyone living in a Levittown knows that.

2006-06-18T00:00:00Z,"THE big spring ritual at our place just happened: the removal of the swimming pool cover. The exact date of this ceremony is determined by the pool guys, who cast runes to determine when, in exchange for a hefty financial tribute, they will deign to drop by and perform juju on the pipes, mutter incantations over the filter motor, and otherwise awaken the machinery whose continued function is the difference between a pool and a concrete-bottomed fen. But before this can happen, we have to remove the cover, a leaf-collecting tarp under which the pool hibernates all fall and winter, and top up the water level. We know that the time to do this is approaching when the weather, which had been giving hints of spring, suddenly turns cold and gray and dumps shower loads of new rainfall onto the cover, making it sag even more and adding extra broth to the slurry of leaf mold already fermenting there. Getting this gunk out is an extremely nasty job, and I try to leave it for my wife."

This British quintet's debut, ''Coming On Strong,'' was an oddball mix of sad lyrics, mournful atmospherics, Casio keyboards and ironic gangsta posturing. In the rap sendup ''Playboy,'' the vocalist Joe Goddard boasted of ''blazin' Yo La Tengo'' in a Peugeot decked out with 20-inch tire rims. The funky white-boy shtick often overshadowed the band's ability to plunder elements from disparate sources -- Prince, Devo, Aphex Twin, Beck, indie rock -- and fuse them in a surprisingly fresh new way."

That is certainly the hope of Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, chairman of Platinum Studios, a company with interests in comics, film and more. ''I've had a long history of being willing to look at unpublished writers and artists,'' Mr. Rosenberg said. One of the company's biggest hits, ''Men in Black'' (which inspired the megasuccessful Will Smith films), was rejected by scores of publishers before Mr. Rosenberg said yes. Visitors to www.comicbookchallenge.com can submit their artwork or story ideas through July 5. A team at Platinum, which is open to concepts beyond superheroes (one project in development, ''Cowboys & Aliens,'' left, mixes genres), will choose 50 finalists, who will present their work to judges on July 20 in San Diego. The top three will pitch their ideas on ''Streetside San Diego,'' on KNSD, the NBC television affiliate in San Diego. Votes cast online from July 21 to 24 will decide the winner.

What can be done about it? While lactic acid can cause a burning sensation during hard exercise (because it is, as the name suggests, acidic) recent research has confirmed that the real culprits for the so-called delayed muscle soreness that comes one to three days after a big game or heavy workout are microscopic tears and trauma to the muscles and inflammation."

2006-06-19T00:00:00Z,"'Cars' Roars On The G-rated ''Cars'' (Buena Vista), right, rolled past the $100 million milestone in its second week in release as it gathered an estimated $31.1 million in weekend grosses to retain its top ranking at North American box offices. Finishing second to the animated auto film was the new comedy ''Nacho Libre'' (Paramount), starring Jack Black as a Mexican luchadore, or masked wrestler. It took in $27.5 million, according to the estimates of the box-office tracking company Exhibitor Relations. Next came ''The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift'' (Universal), with $24.1 million, and ''The Lake House'' (Warner Brothers), with $13.6 million. Rounding out the top five was the Jennifer Aniston-Vince Vaughn vehicle ''The Break-Up'' (Universal), with $9.5 million, a 53 percent decline from the previous week, which nonetheless left it with a three-week total of $91.9 million. Maybe No Baby in Namibia The budding status of Namibia as maternity ward to the stars was looking less fruitful yesterday after a tourism official said he might have been duped into believing that Britney Spears, below, was considering traveling there to give birth to her second child, The Associated Press reported. The official, Leon Jooste, deputy environment and tourism minister, said he made his announcement after receiving a telephone call last Monday from the United States. But he said the connection was so bad that he never got a name or contact information. After The Associated Press reported his saying there was ''a definite possibility'' that Ms. Spears might go to Namibia, it received an e-mail message from a press representative, Leslie Sloane Zelnik, saying, ''Not true.'' Mr. Jooste said he would investigate. Angelina Jolie, seeking privacy, gave birth to her daughter by Brad Pitt in Namibia in May. Auction Is Unsettling To French Academics French academics are keeping a wary eye on an auction tomorrow of a valuable private collection of manuscripts, fearing that some might go abroad, Agence France-Presse reported. In particular they are concerned about two Stendhal manuscripts: 570 pages of his journal and a corrected version of his 1839 novel ''The Charterhouse of Parma,'' reworked, according to the author's notes, ''following the advice of Mr. Balzac.'' The works, to be sold by the Drouot auction house in Paris, come from the collection of Pierre Berès, 93, who decided last year to sell 177 manuscripts and rare editions, collected during the last 80 years and valued at $7.5 million. They include manuscripts by Balzac, Proust and Rimbaud, and a copy of Flaubert's ''Madame Bovary'' dedicated to Alexandre Dumas. Turkish TV Boots Piglet Piglet may have a pal in Winnie-the-Pooh, but he has no friend in the state-owned Turkish television network TRT, Agence France-Presse reported, citing accounts in the Turkish press. The network, an arm of the government, has banned the Walt Disney cartoon ''Winnie the Pooh'' because Piglet, below with Pooh, is a pig; Muslims regard pigs as unclean, and Islam prohibits the consumption of pork. TRT officials were not immediately available for comment, but ''Winnie the Pooh'' has been seen on other television channels in Turkey, and the videos are readily available in stores. Employees of TRT have recently complained of increasing government intervention in TRT policy, and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party are under fire for seeking to raise the profile of Islam in predominantly Muslim but strictly secular Turkey. Footnotes Four weeks have been added to the run of the well-received ''Spring Awakening'' at the Atlantic Theater Company. The final production of the company's 20th season and the first musical in its history, ''Spring Awakening,'' with music by Duncan Sheik, below, and book and lyrics by Steven Sater, will continue through Aug. 6. The annual ''Spirit of Django Reinhardt'' concert will have a new home this summer. Usually at Alice Tully Hall, it will take place in the Rose Theater at Frederick P. Rose Hall, the home of Jazz at Lincoln Center, on Aug. 1 at 8 p.m. The lineup of virtuosic Gypsy jazz guitarists includes Dorado Schmitt, his son Samson and, for the first time, his cousin Tchavolo Schmitt. Other performers include the violinist Florin Niculescu, the accordionist Ludovic Beier, the pianist Peter Beets and the saxophonist Joel Frahm. The Peccadillo Theater Company, which specializes in producing American theater classics like ''Counsellor at Law'' and ''The Shanghai Gesture,'' plans to revive the 1937 door-slamming farce ''Room Service,'' made into a Marx Brothers vehicle a year later. The new production of that comedy by John Murray and Allen Boretz, about a scheming theatrical producer holed up in a Times Square hotel with 19 starving actors while trying to rehearse and find a backer for his show, will open on July 10 at the Bank Street Theater in the West Village. Dan Wackerman will direct, and David Edwards, who played Max Bialystock in the national tour of ''The Producers,'' will portray the producer."
2006-06-19T00:00:00Z,"1 -- A Time to Make Friends POLITICAL CONTROVERSY SWIRLS around Iran's presence in the tournament, but then an Iran fan writes to the Times blog: ''World Cup would have been a great opportunity for us ordinary Iranians to remind the world of our humanity. We are a lonely people: oppressed by our own regime at home and dehumanized by the media abroad. How fitting would it be if we could use this chance to overcome this loneliness, even if for a short time. Alas that it is not going to happen. ... Or maybe I shall hope for a more understanding world for just a short while? It is still a joy to be part of all this.'' Others write in to express their support. ''You're part of this world,'' one writes. ''We love you. Right now, enjoy the goals in Germany. God bless you.'' So we are reminded that the World Cup is not about politics or ugly nationalism; it is about joy and fun and communion. As the tournament slogan says, this is a time to make friends. 2 -- The Battle Of Kaiserslautern THE UNITED STATES PLAYERS, facing elimination, fight like lions against Italy before a crowd whose American supporters are louder than Italy's. Perhaps they fight a little too hard -- two American players are red-carded, along with one from Italy. But they battle to a 1-1 draw and earn the respect of fans around the world. As the Scottish comedian Billy Connolly pointed out that night in New York, in England or Scotland the players would perform a lap of honor if they earned a 1-1 tie with Italy. ''Actually, in Scotland, we perform a lap of honor when we lose,'' he said. 3 -- The Grief and Joy Of Oswaldo Sánchez MEXICO GOALKEEPER Oswaldo Sánchez's father died of a heart attack three days before the opening match against Iran. He flew back to Guadalajara, where he spent 24 hours to mourn with his family, then went back to Germany with family members and was fantastic in a 3-1 victory. 4 -- The Pride Of Mother Africa THE FIVE AFRICAN NATIONS in the tournament -- four of them debutants -- started slowly. Then Tunisia scored an injury-time goal to tie Saudi Arabia, 2-2. Then Angola's 36-year-old unemployed goalkeeper João Ricardo almost single-handedly stopped Mexico in a 0-0 draw. And then, Ghana put on a virtuoso performance against a Czech Republic team that a few days before had looked unbeatable. 5 -- The Goal of 24 Touches AT ONE POINT DURING the match between Argentina and Serbia and Montenegro, Univision's color commentator José Luís Chilavert claimed that Argentina was passing to the beat of a tango. He sang along, and it seemed true. The Argentines won by 6-0, and the second goal, by Esteban Cambiasso, was preceded by an incredible 24 straight passes. The end sequence: Sorín to Saviola, to Riquelme, back to Saviola, across to Cambiasso, to Crespo, backheel to Cambiasso. Goal -- one of the most beautiful in World Cup history. 6 -- Ecuador in the City AS ECUADOR logged two entirely surprising victories to advance to the second round, the team's bright yellow shirts seemed to be everywhere in the streets of Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan. One of us has one, wore it and walked around Brooklyn. Immediately, a shout from a passer-by: ''Ecuador!'' A well-dressed old man, sitting on a stoop: ''They win again today, no?'' Yes, sir, they did. 7 -- Brave Soca Warriors FIRST THERE WAS SHAKA HISLOP versus Sweden. Hislop, a journeyman goalkeeper, stopped everything Sweden had for outmatched Trinidad and Tobago. Then there was little T&T's performance against mighty England, holding out for 80 minutes until finally falling to what now seems to have been a tainted goal. ''SOCA WARRIORS!!!'' one woman from Trinidad wrote on the Times blog. ''You've made your T&T people very proud! Keep playing your hearts out!'' 8 -- Peter Crouch AFTER STRUGGLING EARLY against Trinidad and Tobago, Crouch remembered why big men are on the field, heading a pinpoint cross from David Beckham to give a flagging England its first goal ina 2-0 victory -- even if he had to pull on the dreadlocks of T&T defender Brent Sancho to do it. 9 -- Germany Gets the Party Started GERMANY 4, COSTA RICA 2: The hosts win an entertaining opening match, which offers the promise of a great tournament ahead with six goals, as many as the openers of the last four World Cups combined. 10 -- America's Embrace FLYING FROM SAN FRANCISCO at lunchtime on opening day, one of us tried to catch a few minutes of the Ecuador-Poland match. We belong to a generation that has had to beg barkeeps to change the TV channel to soccer. But we're in luck: The terminal's one restaurant is showing the game. A crowd of businessmen, commuters and maintenance crews are all glued to the screen. There's no eat-your-greens moralizing about the virtues of the world'sbiggest sporting event -- just Americans watching and enjoying it."

In other words, in environments that are already rich in different species, natural selection often prevents large changes. My piece of evidence for this was a claim that, when you take other organisms away - when you reduce competition for food, or space - evolution explodes. Today, I want to examine the truth of these claims more closely."

The makers of ''Syriana'' said it was based on an autobiography by Robert Baer, a former C.I.A. officer, and that filming was well under way when Ms. Vergniault's screenplay received a United States copyright.

Born in Cambridge, MA on June 24, 1916, he moved to Brooklyn, N.Y. as a child where his love for the Dodgers was formed. He first arrived in Miami Beach in 1943 for basic training in the U.S. Army Air Corp. where he would rise to the rank of 2nd lieutenant in the 505th Bomber Group, earning seven battle stars in the Pacific theatre.

The reason for rosy cheeks in children is not as clear as the reasons underlying the general glow of their healthy skin, but some informed conjectures can be made, according to Dr. Lyuba Konopasek, associate professor of pediatrics at Weill Medical College of Cornell University. In children under 2, skin and the layers of tissue under it are thinner, she said, so blood vessels may be easier to see. Until adolescence, faces have fewer wrinkles and invisible pores, with both related to the fact that there is less sun damage, she added."

Born in New York, NY in 1939, passed peacefully from this life at the Holland Farm in Amenia, NY on June 17 after a brief, but intense struggle with cancer. Known within her community--and far beyond--for her tireless energy, community service, and great sense of style, she was active on many committees: the hamlet of Amenias Master Plan, CIPC, New York Relief, Amenia's street tree and flower planting, Cornell Cooperative Extension Dutchess County, Amenia's Business Womens Club, and the Sharon Garden Club. Her immense contributions will be greatly missed. Recently Dolores was named Amenia's Citizen of tHe Year 2006. Dolores (the name she preferred after being amongst so many other Maries in Catholic school in the Bronx) gave to all who knew her stories and impressions that will last forever. After retiring from her work at the Metropolitan Transit Authority in New York City, she and her beloved husband, Larry, moved from NYCs Upper West Side to Amenia full time in 1996. Their farm, the EastWest Bamboo Farm and Garden, is much sought after for garden tours and was included in The Garden Conservancy listing in 2004. In addition to her community work, Dolores was an active member of the New York Master Gardeners, The Mad Gardeners, the American Bamboo Society, and the Conifer Society. Her world travels, often for international bamboo conferences, included Europe, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Borneo,Thailand, Viet Nam, Laos, China, India, Sikkim and Nepal. Her library, home and garden are scattered with significant artifacts documenting her travels, often with close friends. In the 60s, 70s and 80s, Dolores was fascinated by ancient history and archeology, and was a founding member of the Westchester Chapter of the Archeological Institute of America. She traveled during those years to remote areas of Egypt, Morocco, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Mexico. Her professional life at this time was as varied as it was impressive. She worked for the prestigious law firm of Sherman and Sterling, the New York State Atomic and Space Development Authority, and held a position on the Wang Advisory Board. Amid all of this, throughout her exciting life, was a passion for theatre, dance, Asian film, museums, red sports cars, Chinese custard and cannolis. Before moving to the country, Dolores was an active member of the Indoor Gardening Society in Manhattan and became very proficient at growing a wide variety of houseplants, especially succulents and bonsai gardens. With just a few years in the country air, she created a wonderful garden, collecting conifers, bamboo and many unusual trees.Her gardens speak for themselves, but anyone who was lucky enough for a guided tour learned something. Dolores attended mass at the Church of Immaculate Conception in Amenia. Loved by so many, Dolores leaves those who loved her mosther witty, charming husband of 28 years, Larry Dana Holland; her loving son Anthony Poveromo and his wife, Anne-Marie and their precious baby Emily Anne ofHartsdale, NY; her stepsons Kevin Holland of Elkhart, Indiana, and Larry Holland Jr. of Middleboro, Massachusetts, and her siblings Basil Ianni of Hartsdale, NY, and Lydia Narcissi of Lakewood, NJ, and their respective spouses, Joanne and Ron.

The title of Ron Suskind's riveting new book, ''The One Percent Doctrine,'' refers to an operating principle that he says Vice President Dick Cheney articulated shortly after 9/11: in Mr. Suskind's words, ''if there was even a 1 percent chance of terrorists getting a weapon of mass destruction -- and there has been a small probability of such an occurrence for some time -- the United States must now act as if it were a certainty.'' He quotes Mr. Cheney saying that it's not about ''our analysis,'' it's about ''our response,'' and argues that this conviction effectively sidelines the traditional policymaking process of analysis and debate, making suspicion, not evidence, the new threshold for action."

2006-06-20T00:00:00Z,"NBC has signaled its intention to order another edition of ''The Apprentice'' for next season, the show's star, Donald Trump, said yesterday. Mr. Trump said NBC executives had called to inform him that they were renewing the show for a seventh cycle. NBC had no comment. There have been questions about the continuation of ''The Apprentice'' beyond the version that NBC had announced for January, the sixth edition, to be set in Los Angeles instead of New York. But Mr. Trump said yesterday that strong ratings for this spring's finale had led NBC to step up discussions about continuing the franchise. The seventh edition of the series would also be set outside New York, Mr. Trump said, probably in either Miami or Las Vegas. ''The Apprentice'' will be off NBC's schedule this fall, returning Sunday nights in January after the network concludes its coverage of the N.F.L. Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview that he believed that the break would help, especially because the series was overexposed last season when NBC added a version starring Martha Stewart, which fared poorly. Mr. Trump has blamed Ms. Stewart's version for some of the falloff in ratings for his own show.

In its heyday in the 1970's, the show attracted audiences of 15 million, but by 2002 the number had dropped to 2 million. When ''Top of the Pops'' first went on the air it was scheduled for six episodes, but soon proved so popular that it was given a weekly slot. The final broadcast is scheduled for July 30. Judge Delays Retrial Of Notorious B.I.G. Lawsuit A federal judge has postponed a retrial of the wrongful death suit brought by the family of the rapper Notorious B.I.G. against the city of Los Angeles, The Associated Press reported. United States District Judge Florence-Marie Cooper delayed the trial by three months, to Jan. 16, to give the family more time to seek information from the defense. Notorious B.I.G., right, whose real name was Christopher Wallace, was shot and killed on March 9, 1997, after a party at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. The homicide has never been solved. The rapper's family contends that rogue police officers were involved in the slaying. The judge declared a mistrial and ordered payment by the city of $1.1 million in legal fees and other expenses to the family after finding that a police detective had concealed statements by a jailhouse informant that linked the killing to two former officers. Perry Sanders, a lawyer representing the family, is seeking information from 27 city employees that he says had contact with the statements. Jerry Lewis on the Mend Jerry Lewis, below, has returned to work, preparing for his annual Labor Day telethon for muscular dystrophy as he recovers from heart surgery and pneumonia aboard his boat in San Diego, The Associated Press reported.

The Dixie Chicks' ''Taking the Long Way'' (Columbia) held at No. 2 with 130,000 sales, and AFI's ''Decemberunderground'' (Interscope), last week's top seller, fell to No. 3 with 104,000. The hard rock band Three Days Grace reached No. 5 with ''One-X'' (Jive/Zomba), which sold 78,000 copies in its first week of release. Down the chart, the quirky hip-hop duo Gnarls Barkley has made a slow but steady rise since the release of ''St. Elsewhere'' (Atlantic) in May. Last week the album climbed three spots to No. 11; this week it holds there, with 63,000 sales. Andrea Bocelli's ''Amore'' (Decca) jumped 13 spots to No. 12, an rise that Billboard ascribed to Father's Day shopping. Taylor Hicks, the latest ''American Idol'' winner, has a No. 1 single. ''Do I Make You Proud'' sold 228,000 copies in its first week, including 38,000 downloads; it had little radio airplay, though its sales are enough to put it at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, to be announced today, the magazine said. (The Hot 100 chart is compiled by a combination of sales and airplay, while the Billboard 200 album chart counts only sales.) BEN SISARIO"

2006-06-22T00:00:00Z,"United States (0-1-1) vs. Ghana (1-1-0) Jere Longman breaks down a few matchups to watch in today's game. The U.S. must win in order to advance to the second round. 1) Claudio Reyna U.S. VS. Michael Essien GHANA One of the primary matchups could be in defensive midfield, where Claudio Reyna, the American captain, and Michael Essien of Ghana will both play. Pablo Mastroeni is out with a red card for the U.S. And John O'Brien has played little. Bruce Arena said O'Brien was not comfortable in the last week. He has suffered chronic groin, hamstring and Achilles tendon injuries, which apparently have flared up. O'Brien will likely play in Mastroeni's place, but it will be up to Reyna to organize the American midfield. Essien, who plays for Chelsea, can play attacking midfield or defensive midfield and is a fierce tackler. 2) U.S. VS. Ghana's Goalkeeper Brian McBride, Landon Donovan and perhaps Eddie Johnson against Richard Kingson, Ghana's goalkeeper. The United States has created no goals of its own in the first two games. Its only score came when Italy put the ball into its own net. The Americans have officially put only one shot on goal. They must win this game to advance, so the offense will have to come alive. 3) Red Card Replacements Eddie Pope is out with a red card in the central American defense. Perhaps Jimmy Conrad will replace him. Striker Asamoah Gyan is also out for Ghana with a red card, but the Ghanaians have potent scorers in forward Matthew Amoah and central midfielder Stephen Appiah."

''The acquisition, which will be combined with the university's existing Bellow archive, is in accordance with Bellow's own wishes and brings his professional papers to one location,'' the university said in a statement. Bellow, a winner of the Nobel and Pulitzer prizes who died in 2005, was a member of the university's faculty for more than 30 years and the author of novels like ''Herzog,'' ''Humboldt's Gift'' and ''The Adventures of Augie March.'' Arctic Monkeys Bassist Quits Andy Nicholson, right, the Arctic Monkeys bassist who pulled out of that indie rock band's North American tour last month, has left the band for good, the BBC reported. ''We are sad to tell everyone that Andy is no longer with the band,'' said an announcement from the other three members on the band's Web site, www.arcticmonkeys.com. Mr. Nicholson's departure in May, days before the band was to start a 17-date tour of the United States and Canada, was attributed to ''fatigue following an intensive period of touring.'' Nick O'Malley, who will continue with the group for the rest of the summer, took his place. Farewell to Billy Preston Joe Cocker sang and Little Richard reminisced as hundreds of friends and relatives gathered in Inglewood, Calif., for the funeral of the prolific songwriter and keyboardist Billy Preston, sometimes known as the fifth Beatle, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Preston, who played with the Beatles, was 59 when he died on June 6. ''He made that piano walk and talk,'' said Little Richard, who discovered Mr. Preston, who was then in high school, took him on tour in the early 1960's and introduced him to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Mr. Cocker drew shouts and thunderous applause when he sang ''You Are So Beautiful,'' written by Mr. Preston. Mourners also heard letters written by Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and others who toured and recorded with Mr. Preston. Literary Auction Sets Marks Records were toppled in Paris, where organizers said an auction of rare French manuscripts had taken in over $17.5 million, more than double the estimate, Agence France-Presse reported. Gathered over 80 years by Pierre Berès, 93, the collection included a volume of 16th-century bird drawings by the painter Gourdelle, which fetched $1.76 million, a record for a book sold in France. The auction, at Drouot, also set a world record for a first edition of French literature when a first edition of Arthur Rimbaud's ''Season in Hell,'' dedicated to his lover and fellow poet Paul Verlaine, sold for $643,146. Six sections of a diary by Stendhal, the author of ''The Red and the Black'' and ''The Charterhouse of Parma,'' were to be auctioned, but the French government intervened, using its pre-emptive right and paying $1 million for the 570 pages. They will join 16,000 pages displayed at a museum dedicated to Stendhal. Rediscovered Schiele Landscape Brings Millions A monumental Egon Schiele painting, believed missing or destroyed for more than 60 years, has been sold at Christie's in London for $21.5 million, the BBC reported. The 1914 masterpiece, ''Wilted Sunflowers (Autumn Sun II),'' right, a homage to van Gogh's ''Sunflowers,'' surfaced last year when an anonymous collector sought appraisal. When the collector learned that the Nazis had confiscated the painting in 1938 from Karl Grünwald, an Austrian industrialist and antiques dealer, he asked Christie's to return it to the heirs, who put it up for auction. It had been expected to bring $7 million to $10.6 million. Jazz Honors Sonny Rollins, below, took top honors at the 10th annual Jazz Awards, The Associated Press reported, as he was named musician of the year and tenor saxophonist of the year.

2006-06-22T00:00:00Z,"LIGHTING designers are having fun with materials this season, although there are still pieces out there for the less bold. The newest hanging pendants and chandeliers come in familiar materials, like spun aluminum and glass, and more surprising ones, like wool felt, goose feathers and crystals dipped in rubber. This last example might sound outré, but unexpected combinations of materials are not new to Tobias Wong, the Brooklyn designer responsible for it; he also makes a bed cover in black bulletproof fabric. 1. The L-LX hanging pendant, designed by Jaime Salm of Philadelphia, is made of powder-coated spun aluminum. The two-piece fixture is 14 inches tall and 19 inches in diameter at the bottom of the ring. It takes bulbs of up to 120 watts. Because the cone-shaped pendant can be used with or without the bottom ring, and because both pieces come in a choice of white, black or silver, there are many color combinations available. The pendant alone is $139; with a ring it is $195. The ring alone is $64. From (215) 925-9359. 2. Delight is a hanging shade made of wool felt, aflutter with three-dimensional hand-cut butterflies. Designed by Nahoko Koyama, the British-made shade is 10 1/2 inches high and 9 inches in diameter. The fixture takes a compact 20-watt fluorescent bulb, the equivalent of a 75-watt incandescent one; it is $105 from 2jane.com or (813) 832-5263. 3. Tobias Wong has taken a 12-bulb crystal chandelier and dipped it in white industrial rubber to create a more modern fixture. The rubber can be peeled off when the owner wants a more traditional look. The 24-inch-high chandelier is $4,900 from citizen-citizen.com or (415) 695-7748. 4. Lyra, a lacquered aluminum shade, can be raised or lowered for overall illumination or more concentrated light; $19.99 at Ikea stores only, ikea.com or (877) 345-4532 for store locations and availability. A fixed, unmovable version is $9.99. 5. Pearl is a hand-blown glass fixture designed by Ragna Berlin, a Swedish designer working in New York. Each is slightly different, but all are about 18 inches high and 12 inches wide. The fixture takes up to a 100-watt bulb and is $1,100; for store locations, ameico.com or (888) 350-8765. 6. Veneziano is an opaline Murano glass chandelier with six arms. It is $5,400 at Ruby Beets, 25 Washington Street (Main Street), Sag Harbor, N.Y., or (631) 899-3275. The chandelier can also be ordered with 8 or 12 arms. 7. Pluma Cubic is a globe made of goose feathers, 35 inches in diameter.

The first issue included pieces by Elizabeth Hardwick, Mary McCarthy, W.H. Auden, Robert Penn Warren, Norman Mailer, and Gore Vidal. Barbara Epstein, as coeditor of The New York Review, was equally fierce as a protector of the rights and causes she believed in and as a champion and mentor for younger writers. She worked long and tirelessly on articles that exposed injustice and that presented new talent to readers. She had a particular love for the arts, and that love infused much of the work published by the Review. Memorial donations in Barbara's name may be made to the following organizations that work on behalf of AIDS orphans in sub-Saharan Africa and a variety of justice, health, and human rights issues: CAFOD (www.cafod.org.uk), the Firelight Foundation (www.firelightfoundation.org), FXB USA (www.fxb.org), or Save Africa's Children (www.saveafricaschildren.com)."

2006-06-22T00:00:00Z,"Senator Arlen Specter, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he would hold his own summer sessions on immigration policy. His move came after House Republicans said Tuesday that they would delay negotiations on immigration legislation pending a new round of hearings. Mr. Specter said his first hearing on July 5 would be held in Pennsylvania, the state he represents, and would explore the need for temporary guest workers in agriculture and other industries. ''I'm doing it to develop a broader, factual, evidentiary record on the need for the comprehensive bill, which is challenged by quite a number of House members,'' Mr. Specter said. CARL HULSE (NYT)"

2006-06-22T00:00:00Z,"BURLINGHAM--Adair M., 72. A Cambridge chef and writer, died Tuesday, June 13, of complications from Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), a rare neurologicaldisease. Born in New Orleans, she graduated from the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania and entered Radcliffe College at 16, graduating in 1954 with honors. As a young wife and mother in Massachusetts she taught second grade at Buckingham School in Cambridge, started a catering business in Chestnut Hill, drove a taxi and eventually became a chef at the Peasant Stock restaurant in Somerville, where she worked for 14 years, winning many culinary awards without ever following a recipe. She would rather cook for forty than for four, and always welcomed surprise dinner guests. She experimented with all foods and enjoyed everything (except lasagna) gnawable bones, sweet breads, okra, jambalaya, salad with poached eggs with Tabasco on all. She wrote poetry and short stories, hosted Shakespeare readings, studied Italian, Chinese and James Joyce, spent many summers at the Sewanee Writing Program in Tennessee and participated in various writing groups, including most recently her Food Writing Group. Upon retirement, she became a freelance grandmother, traveling in her Marimekko dresses to the homes of each of her eighteen newborn grandchildren as they appeared, where, according to one grandchild, she made ''the best bacon.'' She loved going to the movies with grandchildren, friends or even alone. She loved Bach, the Mendelssohn Octet, James Taylor, the Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle and family games of Scrabble. She was known for her funky clothes, her original turn of phrase, her amiable kookiness and her great heart. She bravely survived esophageal cancer, which is nearly always fatal, and for many years afterwards her surgeon would proudly introduce her to his Harvard Medical School classes as ''Exhibit A.'' Called ''Dearie'' by all who knew and loved her, she leaves her husband, Charles Burlingham, Jr of Cambridge, five daughters, Barbara (and John) McGrath of Windham, CT, Mary Meley of West Hartford, CT, Susan (and Doug) Frank of Kennebunk, ME, Eliza (and Michael) Anderson of Lincoln, MA and Alice (and Roger) Wille of Lake Park, FL; her stepdaughter and stepson Robin Burlingham (and Pan An-Yi) of Ithaca, NY and Nicholas (and Camille) Burlingham of Stonington, CT; and eighteen grandchildren: Michael, Mary Adair and Frances McGrath; Margaret and Elizabeth Meley; Sarah, David, Chloe and Louis Frank; Sam, Charlie, James and Ian Anderson; Heidi Thorpe; Julian and Aidan Pan; and Caroline and Colin Burlingham. Services will be held at Memorial Church in Harvard Yard, Cambridge on July 8, 2006 at 2:00 P.M. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Society for PSP at www.psp.org.

2006-06-23T00:00:00Z,Legislation that would impose stricter requirements on the use of eminent domain was approved yesterday by the General Assembly over objections from some Republicans that the bill did little to protect homeowners. Legislators have been under pressure to revise the state's redevelopment law since a United States Supreme Court ruling last June 23 that allowed local officials in Connecticut to take a residential neighborhood by eminent domain to turn over to a developer. The Assembly bill narrows the criteria for declaring an area ''in need of redevelopment'' and requires more public hearings on development proposals and better notice to property owners. It also improves compensation for people who are forced to sell. A Senate committee plans hearings on the issue later this summer. LAURA MANSNERUS (NYT)

2006-06-23T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''American Muslim Clerics Seek a Modern Middle Ground'' (front page, June 18): Kudos for profiling two influential Muslim leaders who have a palpable influence in the mainstream American Muslim community. After reading frequent articles describing the hopeless endeavors of pariahs trying to effect change in the broader Islamic community, it's refreshing to read about people whose thought actually matters among the majority of Muslims in America. The truth is that those who will dictate the future of Islam in America and the world are those who speak within the tradition, admonishing Muslims to emulate the noble character of their prophet, not those who place themselves outside that tradition and show only contempt for the vast majority of Muslims. Bisher Tarabishy Brooklyn, Ohio, June 18, 2006 To the Editor: It is encouraging to read that there are American Muslim clerics seeking ways to mesh their faith with our society's modernity. But it is troubling that one of those clerics said that he hoped that America would become an Islamic country ruled by Islamic law. There is nothing wrong with wanting to spread understanding of Islam in America. The better we understand all religions, the better our pluralistic society will be. Religion flourishes in America because we have no imposed religion, as the founding fathers designed. Imam Zaid Shakir's hope for an America ruled by Islamic law is fundamentally un-American. Our hope is that he is an aberration and that moderate Muslim voices will prevail. Abraham H. Foxman National Director Anti-Defamation League New York, June 19, 2006 To the Editor: Imam Zaid Shakir's call for his fellow Muslims to mobilize to help those in need -- especially in war-torn Congo -- is laudable. But by asking, ''Where are the Muslim Doctors Without Borders?'' and urging people to ''form it,'' he unwittingly gives a false impression about the nature of Doctors Without Borders and the humanitarian action we practice. Humanitarian assistance is characterized precisely by the fact that it is provided solely on the basis of need, without a religious, political or economic agenda of any kind. In fact, this impartiality is crucial for our international and local aid workers, who come from a wide variety of backgrounds, in delivering medical aid to people in crisis around the world.

2006-06-23T00:00:00Z,"For much of his career, Gonzalo Rubalcaba has been the quintessential Cuban piano monster, blessed (and sometimes cursed) with ferocious technique and the audacity to indulge it. But a noticeably gentler and more introspective tone has crept into his musical persona in recent years. Probably the most dramatic evidence of the shift is a pair of courtly albums by the bassist Charlie Haden -- ''Nocturne'' and ''Land of the Sun,'' both on Verve -- for which Mr. Rubalcaba, above, not only played piano but also wrote most of the arrangements. (For a handy contrast, put those albums in a CD changer alongside ''The Montréal Tapes,'' a Verve release that documents Mr. Rubalcaba's breakout performance with Mr. Haden in 1989, and ''Discovery: Live at Montreux,'' Mr. Rubalcaba's own Blue Note Records debut, recorded the following year with the same personnel.) Mr. Rubalcaba's recent Blue Note albums suggest that restraint has tempered his proficiency without clouding or diluting it. ''Paseo,'' released in 2004, is a tour de force of Afro-Cuban fusion remarkable for its unassuming self-assurance. ''Solo,'' issued earlier this year, might be an even more considerable accomplishment: it's Mr. Rubalcaba's first solo piano recording on a major label, and rather than staking a claim, he wisely casts a spell. The same sort of magic will most likely transpire during his solo performances at the Jazz Standard next Tuesday and Wednesday; for the rest of the week, he'll lead a promising trio with Matt Brewer on bass and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums.

2006-06-23T00:00:00Z,"DANIEL--Ruth, passed away on June 22, 2006, in Sarasota, Fl at age 83. Ruth was known for fierce determination and tenaciousness in all aspects of her life. Following Hitler's 1933 boycott of Jewish MDs, Dr. Bruno Feilchenfeld and his family made aliyah from Berlin to Tel-Aviv, then a Jewish outpost in British Palestine. Ruth's nursing experience with Jewish and Arab children imbued her with a lifetime commitment to enrich the lives of underprivileged children. Ruth, husband Gerry, and their 2 children immigrated to NYC in 1949, settling in Mamaroneck, NY. In the late 1950s, she played an important role at Gerard Daniel & Co., the premier importer and manufacturer of filtration wire mesh. In the early 1990's, Ruth and Gerry moved to Longboat Key, Florida and became active real estate developers in Manatee County, Fl. They also maintain a home in Chevy Chase, Md. Ruth was passionate about a number of causes and became Life President of the New Rochelle Day Nursery; active on the Bds of Family Services of Westchester, Chair of Jewish Conciliation Board of NY Jewish Federation, Treas & VP for the World Union for Progress Judaism and the Helen R. Payne Day Nursery Program in Sarasota, Fl. Ruth served on the boards of the Sarasota Jewish Federation, American Jewish Committee, Sarasota Jewish Housing Council, and the Tel-Aviv Museum of Art. Ruth maintained her love of Tel-Aviv, and with her husband of 65 years built the first Reform synagogue and community Center in Tel-Aviv, Beit Daniel in 1991. It operates 12 preschools throughout Tel-Aviv and Yaffa. Ruth & Gerry are now completing Mishkenot Daniel, a community center and youth hostel and in TelAviv Yafo, with Tel-Aviv City and Israel Youth Hostels Assoc. Ruth is survived by husband, Gerard, son Dr. Ralph Daniel, daughter Miriam Daniel, Esq.; brother Kurt Feilchenfeld, 4 grandsons,2 granddaughters, and 2 greatgranddaughters. Funeral services will be held at Adas Israel Congregation, 2850 Quebec St, NW, Washington,DC on Sunday, June 25, 2006 at 10:00 AM.

2006-06-23T00:00:00Z,"Celebrities are, by definition, bigger than life, and that is how the commercial photographer Martin Schoeller portrays them in his king-size, extraordinarily lucid photographs. You would not call Mr. Schoeller's pictures flattering, at least not conventionally so. He borrows from the photorealist painter Chuck Close the close-up, mug-shot-like approach, which drains faces of expressive animation and turns them into awesome landscapes of bulges, folds, cracks, pits, craters and stubble. Unlike Mr. Close, whose subjects are usually people he knows personally, Mr. Schoeller portrays famous people like Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Jack Nicholson. (His pictures frequently appear in The New Yorker.) There are some portraits of the nonfamous, including members of an African tribe and a United States soldier who sustained facial injuries in Iraq, but they are not irresistibly captivating the way the celebrity pictures are. There is something magically gripping about how these beings who exist in our collective imagination like pagan gods are so vividly, physically embodied, stripped of the protective veneer of publicity yet untainted by the salaciousness of the paparazzi shot. You can't help thinking, ''So that is what Mickey Rourke (or Donald H. Rumsfeld or Cindy Sherman) really looks like.'' Yet despite the remorselessly clinical scrutiny, they retain their superhuman auras, which may say as much about us as it does about them. If you have ever suspected the fabulous actor Christopher Walken (above) of being from another planet, Mr. Schoeller's eerie portrait clinches it.

2006-06-23T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Amargo is best known as a smoldering young Spanish flamenco star who has gazed out of movie screens and the covers of countless glossy magazines. But underneath that sexy, ebullient exterior lies the soul of an artist in love not only with dance but also with the theater. Those loves combine in Mr. Amargo's ''Poeta en Nueva York,'' an award-winning multimedia production inspired by the writing of Federico García Lorca, that will be presented tonight at City Center. Performed by Mr. Amargo's 30-member troupe of dancers and musicians, this ''flamenco musical,'' as he calls it, will also feature performances by guest stars who include the ballet wunderkind Rasta Thomas, recently in the Richard Move-Mikhail Baryshnikov production of ''The Show,'' and Spanish actors and actresses in filmed readings of the García Lorca poems. Described by El País, Spain's leading newspaper, as one of the most promising flamenco talents to have developed in years, Mr. Amargo, above performing ''Poeta,'' is greeted like a rock star in Europe. But New York has seen a lot of flamenco in recent years. What is different about this? ''It's not different, my company,'' he said. ''What's different is my feeling, my intuition about flamenco. People in Spain say it's eclectic. I like everything. But my power is my sexy flamenco feeling. My elegance. Sometimes flamenco is very savage.'' Mr. Amargo was trained in flamenco by Mariquilla and Maite Galán. He was inspired to begin training and classical Spanish dance at the Royal Conservatory of Madrid at 9, after seeing Antonio Banderas in ''Carmen.'' ''I don't like dance for dance,'' he said. ''If I liked that, I would go to the street or my father's house. For me the story is important. Movement is dance.''

2006-06-23T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''No More Teachers, Lots of Books,'' by Sara Bennett and Nancy Kalish (Op-Ed, June 19): As a high school history teacher for nearly 35 years, I know that hard work, discipline and practice are keys to high achievement, whether in the arts, athletics or academics. A reasonable amount of summer homework keeps the mind sharp. There's a reason children are told that ''practice makes perfect'': a daily regimen of practice lays the foundation for a bravura performance, regardless of discipline. Writers write every day, and musicians practice every day. Michael Jordan was the first to arrive for basketball practice and the last to leave the gym. He didn't take the summer off. Marvin Pollock Brooklyn, June 20, 2006 The writer is director of studies at the Berkeley Carroll School. To the Editor: Even beyond the questionable practice of overloading kids with schoolwork on their vacations, Sara Bennett and Nancy Kalish claim that ''there's serious doubt about whether homework has any benefit at all.'' As a former high school English teacher, I would like to thank all those math, science, social studies and foreign-language teachers who canceled their homework, leaving my students time to read Shakespeare and Dickens and to write the occasional essay, personal narrative, story, poem and play. Based on my own eight years in the classroom, I see no way to teach reading and writing except by reading and writing, two rather time-consuming activities. With respect to homework and learning, as Lear says to Cordelia, ''Nothing will come of nothing.'' Craig Hanoch Highland Park, N.J., June 19, 2006 To the Editor: Though I agree with Sara Bennett and Nancy Kalish that an overload of homework is unnecessarily taxing to children, not all summer homework is evil. My daughter's middle school assigns summer homework so that the children can start right in discussing a novel on the first day of school rather than have to wait a week or two for them to read it after school starts. The provocative questions the kids were asked to consider over the summer were among the best assignments that my daughter has ever been given. So, a moderate, well-crafted summer assignment seems like a wise approach. Jennifer Prost Montclair, N.J., June 19, 2006 To the Editor: Sara Bennett and Nancy Kalish lament the ever-increasing barrage of summer schoolwork being assigned to children but do not mention what drives this trend. It is precisely the ''months of freedom stretching out ahead,'' an anachronism from the days when children were needed on farms. At no other time in their lives will Americans enjoy such long vacations. Indeed, as adults they will find their vacations among the shortest in the industrialized world. Ms. Bennett and Ms. Kalish question whether students' skills can be so fragile that they will slip without summer work. Who knows? But what has been proved definitively is that skills learned in school slip significantly during the summer break. And ask any athlete or musician what happens when he or she goes without practicing for three months. All of which points to an obvious answer: Shorten the summer break! Extend the winter and spring breaks, and make them all what children really need: weeks, not months, of unencumbered freedom. Suzy Maroon Washington, June 19, 2006 To the Editor: Kids are working hard over the summer whether they realize it or not -- perfecting the undervalued art of relaxation and cultivating an imagination that is desperately needed in our ever-changing world. Some homework is reasonable (I first encountered some of my favorite books as summer-reading homework), but the response assignments can wax to absurdity, and elementary school math packets still haunt my dreams. Moderation is essential and creativity even more so. Kids are inventive by nature: give them options and artistic liberty, and they will develop in ways that are vital to life, even if you can't measure them on the SAT. Julia Collins Stratford, Conn., June 19, 2006 To the Editor: I'm embarrassed to say there was a time we thought that homework was one of the most important parts of our two young sons' school day. Now that one is in middle school and the other is in high school, we realize just how wrong we were. It's so obvious to us today that this in fact was the part of the day they should have been having fun just being kids. We've been only lucky in that they've done well academically in spite of the amount of homework they had, and not because of it. It's all too sad. Ellen Schleifer Brooklyn, June 19, 2006 To the Editor: I would like to counter the argument against ''vacation homework.'' First, American students spend a relatively shorter time in the classroom than their global counterparts. Second, during the school year, students are involved in a myriad of extracurricular activities, limiting their opportunity for reading great works of literature. Finally, a comment that I frequently hear in the fall from my English students goes roughly like this: ''If you hadn't assigned 'Anna Karenina,' I would have never read it. And I loved it.''

John Ortiz and Patricia Velasquez star. (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. 'SECRETS' Opens on Sunday. Gerald Zipper's play takes place over the course of a dinner party that turns sour and vicious, threatening several long marriages. Directed by Ted Mornel. (1:30). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. 'SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD' In previews; opens on Wednesday. Two parents, a pair of artists, re-examine their seven-year-old relationship after the accidental death of their child in this play by Orran Farmer, directed by Chris Chaberski (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, Special Theatrical Event 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, Best Play and Best Direction of a Play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, Best Direction of a Musical 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ARABIAN NIGHT' A blonde in a German apartment building sleeps too much; the super takes an unexpected trip to the desert; and a peeping Tom is properly punished in this stylish comedy whose title turns out to make perfect sense (1:05). The East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Anita Gates) 'BURLEIGH GRIME$' A feeble-witted comedy by Roger Kirby about dirty dealings on Wall Street, featuring a pair of skilled actors known for recent television work -- Wendie Malick of ''Just Shoot Me'' and Mark Moses of ''Desperate Housewives'' -- and incidental music by David Yazbek, who wrote the score for Broadway's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' These putative assets are painfully ill served by Mr. Kirby's play, which is long on ludicrous plot and short on fresh humor. (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka) 'ELVIS AND JULIET' This opposites-collide tale by Mary Willard and starring her husband, the television actor Fred Willard, looks like community theater and is just as unoriginal. The title characters are young lovers, he the son of an Elvis impersonator, she the daughter of overeducated snobs. Fred dons an Elvis suit, but it's not enough (2:15). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THE MOST WONDERFUL LOVE' Blue Coyote Theater Group has a rollicking good time with this inventive tale of domestic disintegration by Matthew Freeman. Mother (Lenni Benicaso) and Father (Frank Anderson), after long years together, decide to ''unmarry,'' which isn't quite the same as divorce but just as unsettling for their already unsettled youngest child (Josephine Stewart). But that doesn't begin to convey how nutty this play is. Access Theater, 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'NERVE' In Adam Szymkowicz's romantic comedy, an online couple's first date is a frightening but satisfyingly comic escalation of confessions and demands (1:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444.(Gates) 'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'NOTHING' A morsel of catnip for Anglophiles, flavorfully adapted by Andrea Hart from the novel by Henry Green. Simon Dutton and Sophie Ward play onetime lovers contemplating the possible marriage of their children in this comedy of manners about the string of upheavals that a romance in one generation causes in another (1:40). The 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SATELLITES' This tough-minded, soft-hearted and very likable play by Diana Son (''Stop Kiss'') portrays a world in which traditional ethnic, social, economic and sexual boundaries have become so porous that people are never quite sure who or where they are. Sandra Oh and Kevin Carroll play a couple who move into a Brooklyn brownstone that refuses (literally) to stay still. Michael Greif directs the appropriately fluid ensemble. (1:40). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will and Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'STOPPING TRAFFIC' The actress Mary Pat Gleason's endearing one-woman show about making movies (and just getting through life) while bipolar is a play with both a message and some hearty laughs (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. (Gates) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE WATER'S EDGE' In a bold surgical endeavor that recalls the experiments of the mad Dr. Frankenstein, Theresa Rebeck has tried to transplant the big, blood-engorged heart of a Greek tragedy into the slender body of a modest American comic drama. The resulting hybrid runs amok in a stylishly acted production, directed by Will Frears and starring Kate Burton and Tony Goldwyn (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright, Yussef El Guindi, addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after Sept. 11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'AMERICANA ABSURDUM and THE COMPLETE LOST WORKS OF SAMUEL BECKETT ' 'The Complete Lost Works of Samuel Beckett ' consists of affectionate and hilarious short spoofs of Beckett's spare, rigorous and brooding dramas, as well as tedious segues involving mock threats of legal action against the spoofers. 'Americana Absurdum' is an interestingly glib, deeply cynical satire of stereotypical American greed, rapaciousness and narcissism whose serious purposes are unfortunately clouded by a production invested much more in style than in sense (1:45). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb) 'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200; closing on Monday. (Hunka) * 'AWAKE AND SING!' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2006) Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter putdowns clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'CAGE LOVE' The new thriller by Christopher Denham -- star of ''Red Light Winter'' -- is a compulsively watchable, sometimes ridiculous drama about a man who becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife-to-be (1:30). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'IN THE MATTER OF J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER' In the title role, Thomas Jay Ryan makes morality, in its truest sense, look fashionable. This is a long but frequently gripping play of literate talk and real ideas (2:45). The Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closing on Tuesday. (Gates) * 'STUFF HAPPENS' Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) * 'WAITING FOR GODOT' Vladimir (Wendell Pierce) and Estragon (J. Kyle Manzay) wait and wait, but in this version they're soaking wet, their desolate plot being surrounded by water. A familiar play is injected with surprises (2:00). Harlem School for the Arts, 645 St. Nicho las Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 864-4444; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott) * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis) 'bombon-EL PERRO' (No rating, 96 minutes, in Spanish) A lonely, unemployed, middle-aged man finds a glimmer of hope when he acquires a purebred show dog in this sweet, gritty neo-realist fable from Argentina. (Scott) 'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott) 'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott) * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Stephen Holden) 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Nathan Lee) 'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES' (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis) 'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott) 'LAND OF THE BLIND' (R, 111 minutes) Watching this simplistic Orwellian fable set in a composite Everycountry that swings politically from extreme right to extreme left is like poring over a quadruple exposure. It's a jumble of ideas and images. (Holden) 'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden) * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden) * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis) 'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden) 'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis) * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott) 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly.

(Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AFI (Tonight) AFI gives its slithery, death-and-gloom-obsessed songs a jolt of fierce energy by reaching back to the anthemic hard-core punk of 1980's groups like Agnostic Front (as well as to 90's pop-punkers like Green Day). The recipe works: last week, on the strength of its catchy single ''Miss Murder,'' the band's new album, ''Decemberunderground'' (Interscope), went to No. 1. Also on the bill are Dillinger Escape Plan, which plays an impossibly complex kind of punk-jazz, and Nightmare of You. At 6:45, Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25. (Ben Sisario) ALLMAN BROTHERS, DEREK TRUCKS BAND (Tuesday) Derek Trucks, who is starting to take on a role similar to the young Eric Clapton's -- that of a phenomenally gifted, graceful blues-rock guitarist whose presence makes anything better -- does double duty here, playing with the Southern-rock granddaddies the Allman Brothers and also opening the show with his own group. At 7 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000; $20 to $65. (Sisario) ATMOSPHERE (Monday) Atmosphere is a Minneapolis-based hip-hop group led by Slug, whose keenly written rhymes convey a gloomy sensibility more commonly associated with underground rock. With Brother Ali and Los Nativos. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Kelefa Sanneh) BLUE CHEER (Tonight) On a few gloriously untidy albums in the late 1960's and early 70's, Blue Cheer followed the blunter edges of Jimi Hendrix's sound into a bludgeoning kind of primordial heavy metal, and played it with an un-self-conscious glee that made the band sound like cavemen discovering fire. With Soldiers of Fortune and Titan. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $15. (Sisario) BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Tuesday) Electronica, a live rhythm section and a wildly cosmopolitan spirit meet a charismatic and unpredictable singer, Sabina Sciubba, in the Brazilian Girls. The music dips into reggae, samba, funk and house, never staying in one place long. With Gold Streets and Adam Deitch Project. Pier 54, Hudson River at 13th Street; free. (Jon Pareles) CALEXICO (Tuesday) This collective from Tucson, centered on the guitarist and singer Joey Burns and the drummer John Convertino, elegantly mingles dry alt-country with surf guitar, mariachi and a folk-flavored psychedelia like that of the 1960's band Love. With Jason Collett, a sometime member of the Toronto indie collective Broken Social Scene, who draws inspiration from Bob Dylan and the Allman Brothers, among others. At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Sisario) DEVOTCHKA (Tomorrow) DeVotchKa, from Denver, is the most musically versatile band of the Gypsy-punk trendlet of the last few years. It does its share of wild fiddling and rug-cutting, but also plays a lot of moody, carefully textured ballads that can recall the Tindersticks. The band has a new mini-album with versions of Velvet Underground and Frank Sinatra songs, and recorded the score to a film at Sundance this year. With Norfolk & Western and the Mendoza Line. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14. (Sisario) ESPERS, BRIGHTBLACK MORNING LIGHT (Tonight) These two bands are part of a new wave that aims to revive the sound and the utopianism of 1960's folk. Espers, a mostly acoustic sextet from Philadelphia, plays airy English folk à la Fairport Convention, sometimes surrounding it with a foreboding drone. Brightblack Morning Light's sound is more intriguing because it's harder to place: an electric hum; warbling keyboards that evoke funk; and ecstatic, breathy chants. The songs on its new, self-titled album on Matador were written, the band has said, while living in tents in Northern California. With Mariee Souix. At 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario) FEIST, JASON COLLETT, BUCK 65 (Sunday) Central Park SummerStage's annual Canada Day concert (well, close enough: the holiday is actually July 1) includes two singers whose indie-rock bona fides includes time with the great Toronto collective Broken Social Scene. Leslie Feist, a k a Feist, is a cosmopolitan chanteuse who knows how to rock a club, playing bossa nova, folk, Françoise Hardy bonbons and her specialty, the sad disco ballad; Jason Collett draws inspiration from a narrower field, including Bob Dylan and the Allman Brothers. Also on the bill is Buck 65, a raspy rapper from Nova Scotia who rhymes about the backwoods life. At 3 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free. (Sisario) FIERY FURNACES (Thursday) In a smart scramble of eras and attitudes, the Fiery Furnaces back flippantly surreal lyrics with blues riffs, teetering analog synthesizers, parlor piano and punky noise, coming up with a 21st-century urban skiffle. With Man Man and Standing Nudes. At 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Pareles) DIAMANDA GALÁS (Wednesday and Thursday) There are no small emotions for Diamanda Galás, whose compositions are music theater with its rawest nerves exposed. She takes up fear and rage, mourning and vengeance; her voice can reach operatic heights or slice through a room with primal moans and shrieks and sobs. At 11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $30. (Pareles) * JOSÉ GONZÁLEZ, JUANA MOLINA, PSAPP (Thursday) Connoisseurs of hip television soundtracks might recognize some of the music on this bill. José González, an Argentinean Swede, plays haunting, austere guitar confessions with precision picking and a deadpan hush; his song ''Crosses'' was played in the soap-opera season finale of ''The OC'' this spring. Juana Molina is another whispery Argentine, whose gentle, swirling lullabies draw a listener directly into her reveries. The English duo Psapp places soft vocals over beats constructed from found sounds like splashing water, creaking floorboards and even squeaking cats, creating a kind of hyperintimate electronica; ''Grey's Anatomy'' uses one of Psapp's songs as its theme. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario) I-THREES (Tomorrow) The I-Threes were the great reggae backup singers of the 1970's, formed to support Bob Marley and the Wailers. The members -- Rita Marley, Bob Marley's widow; Judy Mowatt, who was already a pop star in Jamaica when the group was founded; and Marcia Griffiths -- play a rare group date at the Apollo Theater. Also on the bill is Thandiswa, a singer in the trailblazing South African kwaito group Bongo Maffin, who on her new solo album, ''Zabalaza'' (Escondida), mingles traditional xhosa rhythms with hip-hop, gospel and reggae. At 8 p.m., 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305 or (212) 307-7171; $45 to $55. (Sisario) JOE JACKSON (Thursday) In songs like ''Is She Really Going Out With Him?'' and ''Steppin' Out'' in the late 1970's and early 80's, Joe Jackson made his reputation as a cold-eyed master of British soul, bringing a cutting new-wave minimalism to stories of lonely lovers who cry that they are ''so tired of all the darkness in our lives.'' Since then he has proved remarkably versatile, releasing, among other projects, settings of the Seven Deadly Sins and a Grammy-winning recording of his Symphony No. 1. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; sold out. (Sisario) * JAY-Z (Sunday) Three years ago Jay-Z, the rap prince turned record executive, announced his retirement from performing, but he keeps finding ways to stay in the game: albums with R. Kelly and Linkin Park, some guest spots, a big radio-sponsored concert or two. Here he shows that he does not need any ruse but himself. He celebrates the 10th anniversary of his debut album, ''Reasonable Doubt,'' by performing it beginning to end. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) KEANE (Tonight) This British band consists of just a drummer, a singer and an awfully hard-working keyboardist, but manages to flesh out songs of yearning and self-pity with rich sonorities and sharp hooks that make you swear that there's a guitar in there somewhere. Keane has headlined Radio City Music Hall, but plays this much smaller show to promote its lush and mawkish new album, ''Under the Iron Sea'' (Island). At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario) ARTHUR LEE BENEFIT (Tonight) In Los Angeles in the mid-1960's, the band Love, led by Arthur Lee, perfected a distinctly lyrical variety of psychedelia steeped in folk and garage-rock. Now 61, Mr. Lee is suffering from leukemia, and the roster of musicians at this benefit concert reveals some of his wide influence: Robert Plant, Ian Hunter, Ryan Adams, Nils Lofgren, Yo La Tengo, Garland Jeffreys and Flashy Python and the Body Snatchers, a new group featuring Alec Ounsworth of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. At 8, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $53.50 to $128.50. (Sisario) LIARS (Tomorrow and Monday) The Liars are an avant-garde rock band the way all avant-garde rock bands should be: noisy, challenging and unpredictable. It began playing cold, paranoid punk-funk and has gradually moved into ever eerier and more disorienting territory, as if trying to eliminate any trace of conventional rock 'n' roll from its sound. Tomorrow the band plays with one of its stylistic ancestors, Alan Vega of the great 1970's noise-punk minimalists Suicide; tomorrow and Monday's shows also include the Apes, a chaos-loving band from Washington that always keeps one yeti-like foot in Black Sabbath stomps. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; Monday at 8 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780.

She performs with the powerful Irish-American Susan McKeown, the fiddler Donnell Leahy (who is also Ms. MacMaster's husband), the cellist Natalie Haas and the singer Catherine Russell. At 7:30, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation.

Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $64.50 to $354.50.

At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $49.50 to $99.50. (Sisario) ONE RING ZERO, LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE, SLAVIC SOUL PARTY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Barbès, a cozy bar and cabaret in Park Slope, serves as an incubator for a group of smart and casually eclectic musicians, the type who might mingle a little Gypsy music with their norteño. Now the club has started a record label to extend its support (and brand name), and offers a showcase this weekend. One Ring Zero, tonight at 9, has set words by authors like Jonathan Lethem, Margaret Atwood and Rick Moody to kitchen-sink songs with toy piano and theremin. Las Rubias del Norte, at 10:30, play boleros, cumbias and other Latin styles, elegantly arranged for a small band and two songbird sopranos. Slavic Soul Party, tomorrow night at 10, plays a raucous mix of Eastern European music, funk and jazz. Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; $8 suggested donation. (Sisario) PANIC! AT THE DISCO, DRESDEN DOLLS (Wednesday and Thursday) Panic! at the Disco, from Las Vegas, were discovered by Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy, who quickly signed the band to his own label, Decaydence. It's not hard to see why: the group has the slick runway look of the Killers (also from Las Vegas); the muscular, gushy emo-rock sound of Fall Out Boy; and a knack for song titles that could be Oscar Wilde epigrams, like ''The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage'' and ''Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off.'' The Dresden Dolls play elaborate, gender-bending cabaret-punk vamps and dress the part. At 7:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) * REFUGEE ALL STARS OF SIERRA LEONE (Tonight) These six musicians, ranging from a teenage rapper to a guitarist in his 50's, fled civil war in their homeland for a refugee camp in rural Guinea.

At 7 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free. (Sisario) * BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN WITH THE SEEGER SESSIONS BAND (Tomorrow and Sunday) A hootenanny of musicians, playing banjos, accordions, fiddles and guitars, accompanies Bruce Springsteen in folk songs of work, hardscrabble survival and political anger -- the Depression-era ''How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live'' gets a Hurricane Katrina rewrite -- from his latest album, ''We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions'' (Columbia). At 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698; $46.25 to $91.75. (Sisario) * THE STREETS, LADY SOVEREIGN (Tuesday) The best and weirdest of new British hip-hop: the Streets, a k a Mike Skinner, is a loquacious rapper whose monotonous delivery can sometimes make him sound like a robot learning to rhyme, and Lady Sovereign, a k a Louise Harman, is a teenage firecracker who is one of the most entertaining exponents of grime, a hyperactive rap-plus-techno British subgenre. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

At 2 p.m., the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $58, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden) BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden) * Eartha Kitt (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday nights) The latest edition of an act Ms. Kitt has been performing for decades is the lightest, swiftest and funniest one to date, and that's all to the good. More than ever, the singer, now a glamorous 79, pauses to poke fun at her status as the greatest and wittiest of all singing tigresses. At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $100. (Holden) * JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday nights) A theater singer with jazz chops, Ms. Molaskey combines sophisticated wit, fierce intelligence and a lightly swinging voice that hovers on the keen edge between happy and sad. A hybrid of the bossa nova standard ''Desafinado'' and Billy Joel's ''Summer, Highland Falls'' performed Brazilian style, is the pinnacle of a show whose material she describes as ''limbo songs.'' At 9, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $50 cover; $60 prix fixe dinner required at all 9 p.m. shows; $20 minimum at the late shows tonight and tomorrow night.

(Nate Chinen) ANDY BEY (Wednesday through July 1) Intimacy is a hallmark of Mr. Bey's vocal style, which alternates between a rich baritone and a burnished falsetto. He's also a fine pianist, as he'll surely demonstrate here. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) BRAZIL NIGHTS (Tonight and tomorrow night) The superb guitarist Romero Lubambo leads two Brazilian jazz acts this weekend, and neither should be missed. Tonight it's Trio da Paz, with the bassist Nilson Matta and the drummer Duduka da Fonseca; the pianist Kenny Barron will join them as a special guest.

(Chinen) JIM BLACK'S ALAS NO AXIS (Sunday) Noise rock, along with numerous strains of music made on laptops, exerts a heavy influence on Mr. Black's music, as his new album, ''Dogs of Great Indifference'' (Winter & Winter), confirms. But tuneful lyricism and jazz improvisation also have a place in his working band, which features his drums and electronics, on the same plane as Chris Speed's tenor saxophone and clarinet, Skuli Sverrisson's electric bass and Hilmar Jensson's guitar. At 8 and 9:30 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen) * A SALUTE TO CACHAO: MASTER OF THE MAMBO (Tomorrow) In the 1940's Israel Lopez, known as Cachao, helped define modern Cuban music; he is the most influential Latin bassist of all time, and one of Cuban music's most important bandleaders.

At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35 to $85. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) BILLY CHILDS JAZZ-CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) Mr. Childs, an accomplished pianist, composer and producer, favors a billowy sound in his own music, which sometimes drifts perilously close to New Age. But beneath a genteel atmosphere of piano, saxophone, harp, guitar and strings lurks the action-oriented rhythm team of Scott Colley on bass and Brian Blade on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3303; $25.

(Chinen) JAMES FINN'S NDA NANAA (Thursday) On his recent album, ''Plaza de Toros'' (Clean Feed), the tenor saxophonist James Finn teased out a connection between bullfighting and free jazz, with appropriate doses of bravado and humor.

At 8 and 10 p.m., Jimmy's Restaurant, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) BILL FRISELL TRIO/PETRA HADEN AND KELLY JOE PHELPS (Tonight) Rustic Americana is the prevailing atmosphere of this concert, thanks to Mr. Frisell, one of jazz's most imaginative guitarists, and to the duo of Ms. Haden, a singer, and Mr. Phelps, a guitarist and singer-songwriter. Given the overlapping histories onstage -- Mr. Frisell has recorded with both of his fellow headliners -- it should be a freewheeling evening. At 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, www.symphonyspace.org; $23 and $28. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Through Sunday) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this repertory ensemble, led by his former trombonist and arranger Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ -- like the saxophonists James Moody, Frank Wess and Jimmy Heath -- as well as Roy Hargrove, the trumpeter enlisted here to fill his shoes.

At 7:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn, www.celebratebrooklyn.org; free. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) HAPPY APPLE (Sunday) This Minneapolis-based trio fashions a hardy yet elastic amalgam of indie-rock and post-bop, with doses of sardonic humor.

(Chinen) * HERBIE'S WORLD: HERBIE HANCOCK AND FRIENDS (Tonight) Mr. Hancock is one of jazz's most successful chameleons, in addition to being one of its finest pianists. This impressive concert gives him the opportunity to dig into fluid pianism (in duets with Gonzalo Rubalcaba); ambitiously abstract chamber improvisation (in a quartet with the tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter, the bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Brian Blade); earthy rhythm section work (in a trio with the bassist Ron Carter and the drummer Jack DeJohnette); and deep-rooted groove (in a band with the guitarist Lionel Loueke and the bassists Matt Garrison and Marcus Miller, among others). At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $40 to $100. JVC Jazz Festival.

The band's last ECM album was excellent; its last Village Vanguard appearance, in January, was even better. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; $25 on Friday and Saturday, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) BILL STEWART TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow night) Though he is known primarily as a sideman, Mr. Stewart, a drummer, has a composer's vocabulary, as he proved with a pair of underrated Blue Note albums in the 1990's. He connects here with Larry Goldings on Hammond B-3 organ and Kevin Hayes on piano, mining a post-bop sound that owes more than a little to rhythm and blues. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15. (Chinen) BUSTER WILLIAMS AND SOMETHING MORE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Williams's bass playing is the anchor but not the focal point of this chamber-jazz quintet, with his longtime rhythm-section partner Lenny White on drums; Marcus Strickland on tenor and soprano saxophone; Stefon Harris on vibraphone; and on piano either George Colligan (tonight) or Anthony Wonsey (tomorrow).

(Anne Midgette) 'GLORY DENIED' (Monday) The invaluable Center for Contemporary Opera, which helps living composers place their operas, either completed or in-progress works, before the public, presents a staged reading of Tom Cipullo's ''Glory Denied.'' This Vietnam-era story is based on an oral history by the journalist Tom Philpott about Col. Jim Thompson, America's longest-held prisoner of war. When Act I was presented in 2004 as part of the New York City Opera's Vox readings, Mr. Cipullo's unsentimental handling of the story was complemented by his hard-edged, neo-Romantic musical style. Though this staged reading will present the complete opera, the cast will be accompanied only by piano. At 8 p.m., the Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $20.

As in past years, music is an important component of this summer's festival, which ends this weekend. Tonight two fine artists, Sarah Rothenberg, playing piano, and John Gibbons, playing harpsichord, juxtapose preludes and fugues by Bach with those by Shostakovich, whose works in this genre were directly inspired by Bach's.

(Kozinn) MUSIC FESTIVAL OF THE HAMPTONS (Tomorrow and Sunday) A gala concert tomorrow kicks off the 11th season of this piano-loving festival that comes, this year, with a few caveats: its artistic director, Lukas Foss, is not actually taking part in any of the season's concerts (although his music will be played), and some of the tent events are listed as ''pending Town of Southampton permits.'' Permits or no, tomorrow's concert travels a colorful road from Vivaldi to Duke Ellington, with stops at Mozart, Ravel and others along the way. On Sunday afternoon the festival continues with a recital by the 12-year-old pianist and composer Drew Petersen; in the evening the director Daniel Anker will introduce his rather turgid film about the musicians of the Philadelphia Orchestra, ''Music From the Inside Out.''

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) * International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Holland Cotter) * METropolitan museum of art: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710.(Kimmelman) * Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter) Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3 Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11 This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed a golden opportunity to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman) New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 18. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith) NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck) * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed. (One gallery bursts with color, another has a cool platinum shimmer.) The 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 7. (Smith) Galleries: SoHo Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by a young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design, and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Ken Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea * 'An Ongoing Low-Grade Mystery' Organized by the curator Bob Nickas, this excellent group show includes works in many different mediums and styles, related in that they are all predominantly red. Donald Judd, Sherrie Levine, Jim Drain, Wolfgang Tillmans and Dan Walsh are among more than 30 artists included. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through June 23. (Johnson) Jackie Gendel: 'Portraits' With seemingly off-hand painterly verve, smudgy colors and a sweet sense of humor, Ms. Gendel creates smart and sensuous, semi-abstract riffs on Modernist portraiture. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through July 1. (Johnson) * NEW VIDEO, NEW EUROPE A selection of 49 tapes by 40 artists from 16 Eastern European countries, several of which did not exist before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, presents bits and pieces of another world. Revolution, landmines, economic hardship and disappearing ways of life alternate with wit and artistic originality. The whole forms an inadvertent documentary, but many of the parts are well worth attention. The Kitchen, 512 East 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, through June 30. (Smith) Last Chance * 'Artists Against the State: Perestroika Revisited' Satiric and subversive Pop and Conceptualist works by more than 50 artists working in the Soviet Union during the years leading up to the end of Communism. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3232, closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * Loretta Lux By means of subtle digital manipulations, Ms. Lux turns color photographs of children in empty rooms into hallucinatory portraits of angelic beings with slightly oversized heads; big, soulful eyes; and beautiful clothes. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * 'The Rest is Silence: James Lee Byars' New York only really started to wake up to James Lee Byars (1932-1997) when he died. This three-gallery survey has some early work but focuses on the large-scale sculptures of his later years. It is tempting to fit him into existing slots: performance art, Minimalism, Conceptualism, whatever. But his extravagance and his privacy combine to keep him outside the fold, as do his philosophical concerns: Big Ideas, or rather Big Questions, about perfection, death and eternity. Perry Rubenstein Gallery, 526 West 24th Street, (212) 627-8000; 534 West 24th Street and 527 West 23rd Street; Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street and 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929); Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623. All close tomorrow.(Cotter)"

2006-06-23T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''The End of Innocence'' (Op-Ed, June 16): David R. Dow seems to miss his information's most important implication. If his shocking figures are accurate that 6 to 8 out of every 100 people receiving capital verdicts are innocent, then the system is clearly setting too low a standard for reasonable doubt. Jurors must be more effectively taught the difference between the most reasonable assumption -- as much of the evidence provided allows -- and beyond a reasonable doubt; judges must also be more willing to interpose with directed verdicts, if a jury's verdict tangibly defies the standard. Only then will the number of wrong capital verdicts descend from the present horror of nearly one tenth to a percentage more normal for human margin of error. The legal system and profession can do great good with serious and expedient effort on this matter. (Rabbi) Bruce L. Cohen Bronx, June 16, 2006 To the Editor: David R. Dow says his opposition to the death penalty does not focus on the likelihood that some innocent people will be executed. But for many death penalty opponents this is a primary argument, and I would like to respond to it. Not executing murderers results in these murderers serving prison sentences, where some of them will assault, rape or kill other prisoners or guards. Some of these murderers will escape or be released and then assault, rape or kill people on the outside. We don't know the names of these would-be victims whom we save by executing murderers, but it is likely that they far outnumber the innocent people that we execute.

FRIEDMAN REPORTING -- The cry of ''Go Green!'' is ricocheting around the country as the war on terror takes a toll on the American economy, and global warming, conservation and energy alternatives become more important than ever to national security. In this hourlong special, Mr. Friedman (above), a columnist for The New York Times, riffs on petropolitics -- a phrase he coined to define the relationship between oil prices and oil-rich nations -- and discusses the political, strategic and economic impact of the country's reliance on fossil fuels while proposing solutions for beating the addiction.

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"WARD POUND RIDGE RESERVATION, a 4,700-acre preserve in Cross River, is one of the finest places in the Northeast to find butterflies. Today, as in earlier times, a watchful visitor will be impressed by the luxuriant chaos of a busy meadow in mid-July when the number and variety of species of butterflies reach their peak. In this busy jumble, scores of butterflies can be observed jostling for position on dogbane and milkweed blossoms. Elegant, gliding monarchs and swallowtails will land to sip nectar alongside smaller, fast-darting skippers. In all, more than 80 butterfly species have been recorded at the reservation, including more than 65 percent of all the species that commonly reside in New York State."

An article last Monday in the news pages of The Times reported that Mr. Flynn had earlier been a paid consultant to Science Applications International Corporation, which manufactured a container-scanning system. The Times's Op-Ed contract compels contributors to disclose potential conflicts of interest, but not past ones. In this regard, Mr. Flynn did not violate the contract.

Sites such as Expedia and Opodo are great, but only show conventional carriers. -- Steve Capper, Trausse, France Many readers are frustrated at being unable to find the schedules of no-frills, or low-cost, carriers on major online travel sites. There are basically three kinds of sites for planning itineraries and making reservations: those that display a choice of airlines and fares and allow you to book and pay with your card on that site; so-called comparison sites, which show options from airlines and other travel sites (not necessarily prices) and require you to click on a link to those sites to book; and sites run by specific airlines, which may give a wider choice of their schedules and fares than other sites."

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"ON occasion, running an alternative art space can be more than just hard work. Late last year, someone walked into City Without Walls in the depressed Lincoln Park area of Newark, picked up a hammer and attacked the director and the education coordinator. Neither man was seriously hurt, and the police later arrested a suspect, but the art institution closed immediately for a six-month renovation that included expanded security measures. A month ago, the gallery, which moved three years ago from its former home in the Gateway Center next to Newark Penn Station, quietly reopened with upgrades including surveillance cameras and a prominent security station at the entrance."

Self-employed professionals can always find something else to do with the free time created by a last-minute cancellation, but this ''gift'' of free time isn't a gift at all -- it's just free.

Frustration with rising electricity costs is understandable. But regardless of who owns and operates power plants, electricity rates closely follow the prices of natural gas and oil, which fuel the majority of the region's power plants. As long as fossil fuel remains the energy source of choice in New England, we can expect continued volatility in electricity prices."

We are the empty nesters -- cliché-ridden, childless, but hardly alone. Nationwide, there are about 70 million parents born between 1946 and 1964, and within the next 10 years or so, nearly all of our youngest children will graduate from high school and move on. In the New York metropolitan area, which includes Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Long Island, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut, half of married-couple households no longer include children under the age of 18, according to the 2000 census data. Soon, we boomers will be one big child-free family, figuring out where and how to live without our little ones."

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"INTERNATIONAL 3-10 Military Plans for Iraq Cuts The top American commander in Iraq has drafted a plan that projects sharp reductions in the United States military presence there by the end of 2007, with the first cuts coming this September, according to American officials. 1 After an unusually violent week in Baghdad, three American soldiers were killed in combat, and a fourth died from injuries unrelated to fighting, the military said. The deaths bring the number of American soldiers killed in Iraq so far this month to 46. 4 As prosecutors prepare to try Saddam Hussein in Baghdad on charges of genocide against the Kurds, a group of experts who have studied chemical weapons use by Iraq against its Kurdish citizens are dusting off evidence in an effort to define the scope of the attacks. 4 Syria and Iran Strengthen Ties Washington may face a worrying phenomenon as it seeks to contain Iran and isolate Syria: the two governments, and their people, are tightening relations on several fronts as power in the region shifts away from the once dominant Sunnis to Shiites, led by Iran. 1 Educating Defectors in Korea Born and reared in one of the most isolated nations, North Korean defectors come to the South Korean government's resettlement centers for a crash course on life in South Korean society. About 6,900 North Koreans have graduated from the center since 1999. 3 Phone Tapping Faulted in Italy Italian authorities' use of phone tapping has long been an issue, and since 2001 the number of tapped phones has more than tripled, the Justice Ministry says. But more and more, legal scholars and worried politicians are objecting on principle, seeing a grave risk to a fair trial. 3 NATIONAL 12-22 Sidelining Immigration Plans House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert informed President Bush that Republicans were effectively sidelining -- and in the view of some congressional aides probably killing -- what has become Mr. Bush's signature domestic initiative of the year: an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws. 1 After promoting Medicare drug plans for three years, the Bush administration is having difficulty regulating these same plans to ensure they comply with federal standards for marketing, customer service and consumer protection. 17 Unifying Muslim Worship A small but determined band of North American Muslims, mostly younger women, has been challenging the practice of segregated worship, which is the norm in the United States and Canada. 14 14 Saudi Detainees Released Fourteen Saudi Arabians were released from the detention center at the American naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and transferred to their home country, the Pentagon said. About 450 detainees remain at the detention center, including 120 who are considered eligible for transfer or release. 16 Washington Screening for HIV Washington, D.C., is launching a campaign to screen every resident between the ages of 14 and 84 for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

She was the loving wife of James Wesley Palmer, who died June 14, 2004. Born January 8, 1928 in Brooklyn NY, she was the daughter of Mary Adams and Thomas Joseph Elhat. She grew up in Brooklyn and was active with the Girl Scouts, which remained a life long interest. Gloria was also an avid and loyal Brooklyn Dodger fan, going to every baseball game she could at Ebbets Field. She graduated from Hamilton High School and Adelphi University in Garden City. She earned her Master of Arts degree in mathematical statistics from Columbia University. Gloria went to work for the Bell Telephone system on Broadway in NYC, where she was the first woman hired for their executive staff. She worked there for her entire career. Her job was to develop trends and forecasting in expenses and revenue and personal statistics. Late in her career she provided economic forecasts for Alan Greenspan. She was very active with the American Statistical Association. Gloria purchased her home in Shushan NY in 1977 and moved there when she retired. On April 30, 1994 she married her longtime friend, James Palmer and they enjoyed a wonderful life together caring for each other and traveling the world. Gloria was a communicant of St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Cambridge where she served as a vestry member. She is survived by her niece, Gloria Zahkes of Norwich VT, a nephew, a niece and several cousins. A Memorial Service will take place on Saturday, July 8 at 11 A.M. at St. Luke's Episcopal Church.

She dresses the part: animal print shirt, lion-head ring, safari vest. Even her patio umbrella is leopard print. And she is not summering alone. Ms. Rosaire, 57, keeps cats on Long Island, the same type of kitty that took a tragic bite out of one-half of her more famous contemporaries, Siegfried and Roy, in Las Vegas awhile back. The type that took a 200-stitch bite out of her in 1991, a breach of trust that briefly caused her to rethink her career and rue the day her only child, Clayton, decided to follow in Mom's footsteps and train tigers (and lions and bears)."

''You get disrespected so much in this job,'' Mr. Acker said, leaning on a lectern in his blue paramedic's uniform at the hospital's Emergency Medical Services Institute. ''At least now it's good we have doctors riding with us in the field, so they can see what it's like when you're lying in the puke in the snowbank at 3 a.m. trying to intubate someone, or when you're bouncing down the highway, going 65 and trying to start an IV.

Born Frances Dilbert, she was the wife of the late Solon Cohen and the mother of the late Roy Cohen. Frances is survived by her children, Laurie and Bruce Cohen and her grandchildren, Nicolas Solon and Sarah Frances Cohen, and her daughter-in-law, Lauren Cohen and son-in-law, Richard McArdle. Fran Cohen was well known for both her philanthropy and her active involvement in many South Florida organizations. She was on the board of directors of The Florence Fuller Child Development Centers for more than 20 years serving as President for five of those years. She was a long time benefactor of the Boca Raton Community Hospital. Fran rarely missed an interfaith service, and was on the board of trustees of Temple Beth El and supported the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County. In addition, Fran gave college scholarships to many local students, as well as being a patron to Lynn University's Excaliber Society and Caldwell Theatre. Fran Cohen was recognized for her kindness and generosity in the many awards she received through the years: A star on the Walk of Recognition honoring those individuals who have enriched the lives of the citizens of Boca Raton; Jewish Federation's Award of Merit; The National Exchange Club's Book of Golden Deeds; Boca Raton Junior League and 1st United Bank's Woman Volunteer of the year; Silver Medallion Brotherhood Award by The National Conference of Christians and Jews; Frances D. Cohen Day for civic achievement from the American Jewish Committee; JC Penney's Golden Rule Award; The State of Israel's Lion of Judah Award; Woman of Achievement Award by The Soroptimist International; Federation's Living People Award; South Florida Magazine's Woman of Distinction Award and Palm Beach County Sun-Sentinel Publisher's Award for community involvement. At Temple Beth El, the Atrium bears the name of Frances and Solon Cohen. Fran supervised the construction of the West Campus of the Florence Fuller Child Development Center and was there so much that the workers gave her a hard hat inscribed ''Crew Chief''. The office and after school building on the West Campus is named the Frances and Solon Cohen Annex. Also at Florence Fuller is an administration building on the East Campus named in memory of Fran's son, Roy Cohen. Fran's positive energy, presence, personality and insistent spirit have contributed much to our world. Her charity, leadership and heroism as well as her strength of character will be missed. She was truly a woman of valor. Services will be at Temple Beth EL 333 SW 4th Ave. Boca Raton, Fla. 33432 Sunday 2:30pm June 25, 2006.

It sits atop a steep, winding private road in the western Connecticut woods in a seven-home enclave herein called the Hill. Soon after we moved in, the Hill's elder statesman, a 70-ish bachelor, introduced himself at the mailboxes. Saying that he ''knew the property,'' he bade us good luck with the kindly gravitas of a funeral director.

Consider the money that former President Bill Clinton has taken in from countries for speaking fees, advice and his library, which could have a great influence on the decisions Senator Clinton would make as president regarding the same countries. It's a complicated web they have created, and it's not lost on the average voter."

Piece by piece, starting in 1976, 16 of them have been installed here to constitute a kind of partial, semipermanent retrospective of Mr. di Suvero's 40-year career. Situated in Mountainville, in New York's Hudson Valley, Storm King is a breathtaking setting for the display of outdoor sculpture. Its 500-acre property encompasses woods, a stream, several ponds, alfalfa fields, lawns and rolling hills. No outdoor sculpture park in the world that I know has such an attractive natural setting."

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"ON this week's cover, Luc Sante, the author of ''Low Life: Lures and Snares of Old New York,'' reviews Robert Greenfield's biography of Timothy Leary. When the Book Review first approached Sante about the assignment, he said he had always wanted to write something about Leary. Why? ''Because I'm interested in the 1960's,'' he explained in an e-mail message, ''and that time is now sufficiently distant that things are coming out, the location of the buried bodies, so to speak.'' Starting in 1968, Sante commuted from New Jersey to high school in Manhattan. ''Nearly every day I bought underground newspapers, from all over the country, at newsstands. They usually cost a quarter. I was a very critical under-age observer of the scene. As a kid of that time, I was checking everything out, including psychedelics, which fascinated me almost as much as they scared me.''"

I lived in New York City in the late 60's, and my roommate and I used that book all the time (except for the canned stuff -- my roommate came from Wisconsin so we didn't go the canned route too often. I do have to admit to Jell-O, however). Therecipes were really quite good, and we happily served many to ourselves and to guests.

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"GORELL--Frank. The family of The Curtis Institute of Music mourns the loss of its devoted friend Frank Gorell and extends deepest sympathy to his family. A recipient of Curtis's Alumni Award, he shared his profound commitment to young musicians through projects such as the young artists' series at the Raymond F. Kravis Center in West Palm Beach, Fla. He also served Curtis as an overseer and a trustee. His pride in his musical training and his unwavering dedication will long inspire us. Roberto Diaz, President H.F.

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"WALTER HILL's ''BROKEN TRAIL'' (AMC, Sunday at 8 p.m.) bucks recent trends in the western genre: the cowboys aren't gay, and they don't curse. And yet this slow-paced, atmospheric mini-series manages to be arresting anyway; its expansive scenery and laconic screenplay are laced with an undercurrent of dread. THOMAS HADEN CHURCH, who looks gaunt after his puffy ''SIDEWAYS'' turn, and ROBERT DUVALL play two decent ranchers looking for a place of their own. Along the way they run into five Chinese women who have been sold into slavery and decide to help them. Which means Trouble with a capital T. (Part 2 is Monday at 8 p.m.) Look out, vampires; the corny ''BLADE'' trilogy has been adapted for television (Spike, Wednesday at 10 p.m.). KIRK JONES, also known as STICKY FINGAZ, will try to capture the impassive, cartoonish campiness WESLEY SNIPES brought to the movie role. Also of potential interest to comic fans this week is ''THE SCIENCE OF SUPERMAN'' (National Geographic Channel, Thursday at 9 p.m.). This tie-in with ''SUPERMAN RETURNS'' dissects all of Clark Kent's super powers in the comics, the movies and on television, and attempts to put them into a scientific context. While that's crazy, it's also embarrassingly pleasurable to hear physicists describe how Superman would have actually crushed Lois -- not saved her -- when he flew up to catch her as she fell from atop a building. (Because she would have reached terminal velocity.) The documentary ''BOFFO! TINSELTOWN'S BOMBS & BLOCKBUSTERS'' (HBO, Thursday at 9 p.m.) is a breezy examination of what makes a movie successful. The film's talking heads -- GEORGE CLOONEY, JODIE FOSTER, PETER GUBER and others -- say ''no one knows'' for 75 amusing minutes. BRIAN GRAZER offers one unintentional gem, when he admits that he has wished failure upon others, and then has to specify that he doesn't mean his friends. That's Hollywood."
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"THE Fairfield Board of Education voted late last month to have the town's two high schools start their day 20 minutes later, beginning in the fall, part of a movement around the state to get teenagers more sleep. Greenwich P.T.A. members have been asking the school board to consider a delay, and board members in West Hartford have also been discussing later start times. Other schools have also looked into the issue, but have made no changes. Wilton became the first school district in the state to make the change when it delayed middle and high school starting times by almost an hour in 2003."
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"FIALKOW--Dr. Morris N. 92, died peacefully on Friday. Loving husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, father-in-law, brother-in-law and friend. An accomplished civil engineer for over 40 years, he served as chief of the design branch for the Army Corp of Engineers. A world traveler, bridge player and opera lover. He will be deeply missed. Burial on Sunday. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the American Heart Association."
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''Perfect Vision, via Surgery, Is Helping and Hurting Navy'' (front page, June 20), in describing the laser eye surgery procedure known as photorefractive keratectomy, or PRK, states, ''Rather than slicing into the cornea covering, Navy doctors grind it away.'' The use of the verb ''grind'' connotes a process involving high abrasion and friction, with trauma to the surrounding tissue. Nothing could be further from the truth."
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"MIGUEL HERNÁNDEZ of Ossining is the only Hispanic mayor in New York State, though that distinction took effect early this month and will last only until year's end. Still, what a statement those seven months will be about how polychrome Cheever country has become. Most Americans still think of Westchester as white, and white bread, except when an urban anomaly like Yonkers conquers that stereotype. But the county, like the country, turns out to have lots of everything, even in its villages. In Ossining, Port Chester, and Sleepy Hollow, Hispanics are a major force."

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"Taking a cue from Manhattan's Chelsea district, with its warehouses and garages reinvented as sleek showcases for contemporary art, two new East Hampton galleries have brought the same look to former industrial spaces on eastern Long Island. One is an adapted commercial unit in a complex that also houses carpentry and landscaping businesses; the other is a former automobile repair shop in Springs. The Fireplace Project, at 851 Springs-Fireplace Road, anchors a small commercial strip that includes a liquor store, a pizza restaurant and Hampton Auto Collision. The building, formerly Talmage's Garage, has been handsomely adapted as an exhibition space but retains much of its utilitarian character. The walls in the main gallery are clean white sheetrock, but the original overhead garage door, the knotty pine paneling in what was the office and the bare concrete floor have been preserved. Instead of car parts, the building now houses dusky landscape paintings by David Ryan, and Wayne White's eye-catching multicolored sculpture of welded lettering sits in the front yard."
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"For the White House, the Congressional picnic last week seemed like the perfect setting to mend strained relations with Republican allies on Capitol Hill: President Bush and his advisers eating taquitos and Mexican confetti rice on the lawn of the White House with Republican Congressional leaders. But moments before Mr. Bush was to welcome his guests, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert told the president that House Republicans were effectively sidelining -- and in the view of some Congressional aides probably killing -- what had become Mr. Bush's signature domestic initiative of the year: an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws."
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"GRUBER--Samuel. 1913-2006. We, the family of Samuel Gruber, will love and miss him forever. He was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He lived his life with humility and dignity. He was an underground fighter in Poland against Nazism and wrote the book, ''I Chose Life.'' Israel was his passion and he had many friends there. He leaves his wife Judith, sons Jack and Mark, three grandchildren and four greatgrandchildren."

Even in June, the remote spot in Hampton Bays where Dune Road meets the Shinnecock Canal is just for locals. But on a recent morning it morphed into command central for ''Easy Driver,'' an Italian television program featuring beautiful people cruising beautiful places in flashy, expensive cars.

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Elizabeth Marshall Thomas misses the point in her review of ''Kicked, Bitten, and Scratched,'' by Amy Sutherland (June 4), when she states that: ''Despite the beliefs of animal rights activists, many captive animals welcome their training. . . . Training gives them a life.'' Wild animals have a life -- it is in the wild. Keeping them in captivity, trained or otherwise, for human entertainment deprives them of that life. If species conservation is important (which it is), it should be done on huge reserves that simulate the natural environment, which means keeping animals away from people. It is hard to imagine that Thomas really believes that the trained animals she describes benefit in any way from their puppetlike existence, or that they are much better off than wild animals kept in zoos.

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"New York art rock is full of isms: primitivism, conceptualism, minimalism, eclecticism, stoicism and skepticism, along with some basic intransigence. TV ON THE RADIO, from Brooklyn, has given the nervous New York rock drone -- as handed down from the Velvet Underground via punk -- at least two twists of its own. Electronics, like mechanistic drum machines and pulsating sustained tones that can fill every cranny of a mix, can make songs sound both exhilarating and claustrophobic, while vocal harmonies hint at the sweetness of old doo-wop. The band hasn't released a full-length album since ''Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes'' in 2004, but a new one is in the works. Friday at 6:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 donation requested. THE LIARS are far less ingratiating. They're an austere and single-minded band whose songs can be little more than a slow drumbeat and a keening melody, sometimes jarred by some extra guitar noise. The band is an all-or-nothing proposition. Anyone who doesn't find them mesmerizing will find them pretentious and annoying. Monday at 8 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; $15 in advance, $16 at the door. THE FIERY FURNACES are led by MATT and ELEANOR FRIEDBERGER, siblings originally from Chicago. Their songs delve into memories and visions, sometimes harking back to 1960's pop, sometimes with a frenetic drive that's like carnivalesque punk. Their latest album, ''Bitter Tea'' (Fat Possum), relies on keyboards, but their Web site promises a live show with songs rearranged around guitar.

In this Faustian allegory Slade Steadman, a rich and rather grumpy middle-aged writer with only one published work to his name, travels to Ecuador to drink a hallucinogenic brew he hopes will stimulate his creativity. Disappointed by the experience, he turns to another drug, expensive and rare (and fictional), that heightens both his powers of perception and his libido, but also leaves him with an unfortunate side effect: periodic blindness. Under the influence Steadman is reinvigorated, and satisfies his sexual fantasies while writing a novel of erotic exploration. But this forbidden knowledge comes at a price, and Steadman, like Dr. Faustus, rises high, then falls far and fast. In the Book Review Hari Kunzru called ''Blinding Light'' a ''bravura performance.''"

His comparison of the national debt to an adjustable-rate mortgage made the problem uncomfortably real, since most of us with such mortgages are dreading the date our teaser rates change into real rates. One crucial point that could conceivably alter Ferguson's dire prediction that our creditors will desert us for others, leaving the United States no choice but to borrow at ''subprime'' rates, is the lack of viable alternative investments.

But really, my husband and I are stealth parents, the ones lingering around the edges of suburban life, the ones who no longer fit into this child-centric universe. We are the empty nesters -- cliché-ridden, childless, but hardly alone. Nationwide, there are about 70 million parents born between 1946 and 1964, and within the next 10 years or so, nearly all of our youngest children will graduate from high school and move on. In the New York metropolitan area, which includes Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Long Island, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut, half of married-couple households no longer include children under the age of 18, according to the 2000 census data. Soon, we boomers will be one big child-free family, figuring out where and how to live without our little ones."
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"HANSEN--William P. Born August 9, 1940 died on June 9, 2006. He was an editor and writer for American Heritage, Random House and Chelsea House. After graduating from University of Wisconsin he studied at NYU and started his literary career. His works covered a wide range of topics from drugs to shells, world leaders and even comic books. His reference works on American politics and history are tomes for the ages. His wit, incredible sense of humor, playfulness, curiosity and powerful mind were a gift to all who knew and worked with him. He will be missed forever by his wife Janet and his daughter Nadja who found in him the most patient and loving of soulmates."

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"Two new movies this week look at the complexities of life after 9/11 at home and abroad. ''THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO'' is a thought-provoking documentary that reflects the complicated situation we are in. Directed by MICHAEL WINTERBOTTOM and MAT WHITECROSS, it details the incarceration of three British Muslims captured during combat in Afghanistan after 9/11 and sent to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, where they claim to have been tortured. The prisoners, known as the Tipton Three, are portrayed as naïve or nefarious young men (you decide) who chose to place themselves in a war zone at an extremely inopportune moment in East-West history. As depicted in the film their treatment since being arrested is shocking, and edifying. If not fundamentalists before, the three men, who have since been released, certainly appear to have become fundamentalists during their incarceration. In New York at the Angelika Film Center, Mercer and Houston Streets, Greenwich Village, (212) 995-2000, and the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, Broadway at 63rd Street, (212) 757-2280, as well as at theaters in Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington; it will open in two weeks in more cities. ''THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL,'' set in New York a year after 9/11, is just the latest film to deal with the aftershocks of the attacks. Starring MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL, OLYMPIA DUKAKIS and TONY SHALHOUB, the movie follows the lives of five New Yorkers as they deal with the trauma. Here's an incongruous note: The drama is directed by DANNY LEINER, who directed the stoner comedies ''Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle'' and ''Dude, Where's My Car?'' In this new film he takes a stab at substance and emotion. Now playing in New York at the Angelika; AMC Empire 25, 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, (212) 398-3939; and United Artists at 64th Street and Second Avenue, (212) 832-1670, and in Washington and Boston."
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"''A man's home is his castle'' goes the adage, which finds perhaps its most literal representation in the fanciful cottage of Wemmick, a London clerk in Charles Dickens's novel ''Great Expectations.'' Although Wemmick's home is tiny, he has modified it to resemble a Gothic fortress of sorts, complete with a plank drawbridge, a moat and a ''turret bedroom.'' While there is no evidence of a run on Dickens novels in area bookstores, much less a conscious emulation of Wemmick, turrets have been popping up with increasing frequency on upscale suburban homes around New York City."

He was reacting to John's last name, DeStefano, and his current position, mayor of New Haven. Without telling the administrator of the site, Mr. DeStefano, a Democrat, had decided to begin a dialogue about his campaign for governor. There was risk involved: Anyone can sign up and comment on the site (which has an off-color name), and there was no telling what kind of vitriol the mayor might inspire. In his attempt to join in an unpredictable forum, Mr. DeStefano seemed at first like someone's dad, trying to be cool."
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Fred Bernstein's lack of ''nostalgia for Orchard Street,'' as noted in his review of the Blue Moon Hotel (Check In/Check Out, June 4) is reflected in his inaccuracies and obtuse comments, which demonstrate a lack of appreciation for the personal and family histories bound to the Lower East Side, and a lack of perspective regarding the preservation and design development of a neighborhood icon; thus, he was an inappropriate choice of critic for our hotel. I was trained as an artist and have created and orchestrated the preservation and design of the building, meshing the historical elements with contemporary materials. This project was neither plotted nor planned. My goal was to keep the process liquid as well as soulful. In a painterly approach, using a combination of inspiration and instinct, I created settings for the original details, as well as enhancing their innate properties, thus resulting in the soul of the building being preserved and glorified as well as useful and functional."

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"The last thing New York's Legislature deserves right now is a pay raise. The lawmakers know they are somewhere near the bottom of any taxpayer's list of things to spend more money on. So they have devised ways of camouflaging pay increases so they will attract the least possible notice. This year, it is time for the voters to pay attention. The Legislature always likes to couple its pay increases with increases for the judiciary. This is totally unfair to the state's judges, who really do deserve a hefty raise."

Where do adults enjoy root beer floats? Answer: all over, from the Hudson to the Sierras -- wherever it is possible to get genuine root beer, rather than that flavorless, characterless brown liquid passed off as root beer in New York. In fact, it is even occasionally possible to get a reasonable facsimile of root beer under the label of ''ginger beer'' at specialty food stores, and to make a passable black cow at home on a July afternoon. The fact is that the heartland is the only part of the United States that knows how to make a proper soda, sundae, shake, malt or split. Rosanne Klass New York"
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"The paintings in ''AMERICANS IN PARIS, 1860-1900,'' on view at the MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS, BOSTON, may look quaint to the casual observer, but they are rooted in a time when Paris embodied the city as public spectacle: cosmopolitan, dynamic, radically new. American artists like Whistler, Sargent and Homer journeyed there to lose their provincial veneer with varying degrees of success. The exhibition includes parodies of Bohemian society like Thomas Hovenden's ''Self-Portrait of the Artist in His Studio'' (1875). His ragged shoes and disheveled clothing were displayed as badges of honor. But the show's highlights are paintings that depict the posturing of the city's fashion-conscious flaneurs: the dandies strolling through Sargent's ''In the Luxembourg Gardens'' (1879) or the portrait Whistler painted of his mistress, ''The White Girl'' (1862). Opens Sunday and runs through Sept. 24; (617) 267-9300 or mfa.org. Few architects have immersed themselves more fully in the art world than the Swiss team of Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. They have designed some of the world's most original museum spaces, from the bold postindustrial landscape of the Tate Modern in London to the fluid interiors of the recently completed de Young Museum in San Francisco. And their work, known for the often surreal quality of its surfaces, has drawn inspiration from artists as varied as Andy Warhol and Hans Richter. With ''HERZOG & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,'' part of the Artist's Choice series at the Museum of Modern Art, they get to try their hand at organizing a show. In the installation, scenes from old films will be projected onto the ceiling, and works from the Modern's collection will be embedded in small niches carved out of black walls. Runs through Sept. 25; (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. The Whitney Museum of American Art indulges in a bit of nostalgia with ''FULL HOUSE: VIEWS OF THE WHITNEY'S COLLECTION AT 75.'' In celebration of the museum's anniversary, the show will focus on flashpoints in 20th-century American art, from Abstract Expressionism to Minimalism to Pop Art. As an added bonus Alexander Calder's ''Circus'' (1926-31) will be reinstalled in the lobby for the first time since 1998. Thursday through Sept. 3; (800) 944-8639 or whitney.org."

Does she realize that I have to pay for her freedom, relief and quieter phones? Marvin Coopersmith Verona, N.J. Credit cards, in one form or another, have been around for some time, but until the last few decades they were given primarily to middle- and upper-income families. This was because state usury laws limited the interest that companies could charge, and the risk of nonpayment by lower-income families was greater than the return the companies could expect. But in its obscure Marquette decision, in 1978, the Supreme Court decided that credit-card companies, based in states without usury laws, could charge whatever they desired to customers in any states, a decision effectively rendering all state usury limitations useless. At this point, credit-card companies flooded the market. The rates they have charged on unpaid balances have risen dramatically. Frederic L. Pryor Swarthmore, Pa."

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Cathleen Medwick, in her review of Jaime Manrique's ''Our Lives Are the Rivers'' (June 4), mistakenly defines the word criolla as meaning ''mixed-race.'' The dashing Manuela Sáenz, Simón Bolivar's famous lover, was indeed a criolla, but not because she was of mixed race. In colonial Latin America, criollos were the American-born descendants of the original Spanish settlers. Criollos were members of the land-holding or merchant classes and generally well-to-do. While some were certainly of mixed race, it is their ties to their Spanish families that define them as a group. It was this class, whose members increasingly saw their fate wedded to the growing societies in the New World, that rose in opposition to Spanish colonial rule in the early 19th century, eventually establishing the republics of the Spanish-speaking Americas. Medwick may have mistakenly assumed the word to be the equivalent of ''creole'' in English, one of whose many meanings is ''mixed-race.'' Ramiro E. Prudencio Miami"
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (AMC) BROKEN TRAIL -- A veteran cowboy and his estranged nephew save five Chinese girls from prostitution while running 500 horses from Oregon to Wyoming in 1897 in this two-part made-for-television movie. Sitting tall in the lead saddles: Robert Duvall, who lives in rural Virginia, and Thomas Haden Church (above left, with Mr. Duvall), who calls a Texas ranch home. 6 P.M. (MSNBC) DARFUR: CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE -- Ann Curry, digital camera in hand, reports on the ethnic cleansing that has terrorized the Darfur region of Sudan and provides the images to back it up. 7 P.M. (CNBC) DLIFE: YOUR DIABETES LIFE -- This series on coping with diabetes begins a new season with a look at health care and insurance, and offers fast-food alternatives for when home cooking isn't an option. 8 P.M. (TNT) HALF LIGHT -- This comeback vehicle for Demi Moore, who plays a mystery writer trying to put her life back together after the death of her 5-year-old son, went straight to DVD. But fans say its setting -- an isolated fishing village in Scotland -- and its haunting story line are big screen worthy. 8 P.M. (Food Network) EMERIL LIVE -- Emeril Lagasse indulges in a little goodnatured competition with his friend and network rival Mario Batali. Their battleground: Italy, or at least its food, with which they demonstrate their own versions of dishes like linguine with red clam sauce, ragu Bolognese and duck scalloppine. 8:30 P.M.

(Elton John?) In this 200th episode, Mr. Lipton lobs a few at Dustin Hoffman (right), who seems to take them in stride. 10 P.M. (BBC America) FOOTBALLERS WIVES -- Darius's fun and games come to an end when Katie, in revenge for being raped in Spain, kidnaps him. And Conrad and Tanya get engaged. For now. 10 P.M. (Showtime) HUFF -- The season is over, but the angst goes on -- at least in this episode, in which Huff answers Russell's call, Izzy visits Teddy, Byrd vents and Beth (Paget Brewster, left) tells Alec where they stand. And he's not going to like it. KATHRYN SHATTUCK"
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"THE Fairfield Board of Education voted late last month to have the town's two high schools start their day 20 minutes later, beginning in the fall, part of a movement around the state to get teenagers more sleep. Greenwich P.T.A. members have been asking the school board to consider a delay, and board members in West Hartford have also been discussing later start times. Other schools have also looked into the issue, but have made no changes. Wilton became the first school district in the state to make the change when it delayed middle and high school starting times by almost an hour in 2003."

But the legal helmet that many bikers wear would not have saved his face. Only motorcycle racers and Nervous Nellies like me wear hot, heavy and expensive full-face helmets. Richard Horwich East Hampton, N.Y. To the Sports Editor: There should be stiffer fines for drivers who create accidents when they are in a much larger vehicle than a motorcycle and endanger the lives of motorcycle riders. Whether or not the motorcycle riders choose to wear helmets is not the issue. Jacqueline Kazlas Dobbs Ferry, N.Y."

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"A CAT from Fairfield had a cheering section in Superior Court in Bridgeport on Tuesday when his owner faced charges of reckless endangerment for failing to keep the cat from biting her neighbors. The cat, Lewis, could have received a death sentence, and people who had followed the case on national television, in newspapers and in People magazine were upset that the cat could die for inflicting a few scratches and bites. They called and wrote letters to Ruth Cisero, the cat's owner, and a few people showed up Tuesday to offer support or legal help. Ron Merly, who lives with Ms. Cisero, said they had gotten as many as 20 calls a day about the cat. One fan even started a MySpace page for Lewis."
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"The first chill-bump-inducing moment of the Who's ''Tommy'' at the Bay Street Theater is brought about by a fifth grader from Katonah, N.Y. When Noah Galvin, who plays the title character as a child, gets into the lyrics of ''See Me, Feel Me'' (''Listening to you/ I get the music/ Gazing at you/ I get the heat''), the show suddenly blazes with life. It just proves that ''Tommy'' has always belonged to the young. But this exuberant, exhilarating, rejuvenating production also belongs to the generation that the original rock opera was written for in 1969 (music and lyrics by Pete Townshend, lead guitarist of the Who, with some contributions from his bandmates John Entwistle and Keith Moon) and apparently rewritten for in 1993 when it went to Broadway.

In general, we have always believed that if the public wants quality legislators, it should be willing to pay for them. Currently, members make a base salary of $79,500 a year.

He was a resident of Hobe Sound, Florida and he maintained a home in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. Hays grew up in Suffern, New York. He attended the Loomis Institute in Windsor, Connecticut, where he excelled in athletics. He went on to Cornell University where he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1941. He served on destroyers in the US Navy during WWII in both the Atlantic and Pacific Theatres and was discharged in 1945 as a Lieutenant Commander. While serving in the Navy, he earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for bravery. Hays joined Avon in 1945 as an engineer in the Suffern, NY manufacturing plant. He became a division sales manager and subsequently a manufacturing manager. In 1960, he was elected corporate Vice President in charge of the international division, and in 1965, he became a division sales manager and subsequently a manufacturing manager. In 1960, he was elected corporate Vice President in charge of the international division, and in 1965, he became President of the International Division. He led the development of Avon's international business. He was elected to the Avon Board of Directors in 1967, and in July 1968, he was promoted to Executive Vice President. He retired from Avon in April 1976 after 30 years with the company. Education and giving underprivileged children a chance to succeed in life were major interests for Hays. He served on the National Board of Governors of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. He founded several local clubs and was actively involved with several others. He was honored with the Herbert Hoover Humanitarian Award, the highest tribute the Boys and Girls Club of America can bestow on a volunteer. For several years, he chaired the Board of Trustees of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, and served on boards of Cornell University, the New York Cornell Medial Center, the Loomis Institute, and several other education, research, and philanthropic organizations. An avid sailor and explorer, he was elected Commodore of the Indian Harbor Yacht Club in Greenwich, CT. And he was an active member of the New York Yacht Club, the Cruising Club of America, Jupiter Island Club (FL), University Club (NYC), and Round Hill Country Club (CT). His ocean racing, cruising and exploring activities ranged from the Caribbean, Baffin Island and Newfoundland. His athletic interests, in addition to sailing, included golf and tennis. Survivors include his wife of 62 years, Rosamond Seidel Clark of Hobe Sound, Florida; three children, H. Lawrence Clark of Chevy Chase, Md., Harris W. Clark of Dallas, Tex., and Valerie Clark McNeely of Newtown Square, Pa.; brother, James McConnell Clark of Palm Beach, Fl and Woods Hole, Ma; eight grandchildren; and a greatgranddaughter. There will be a private family burial service on July 1, 2006 in Hobe Sound. A memorial service is being planned for November. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to local clubs of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. $(6$)CLARK--Hays. Cornell University mourns the loss of devoted alumnus and emeritus trustee, Hays Clark, who, with his family, significantly advanced the physical and natural sciences at Cornell. Mr. Clark was a wise leader who contributed his time and expertise to further Cornell for more then three decades. After 15 years on the board, he was appointed trustee emeritus and presidential councillor in 1982. He also was named a foremost benefactor in 1983 in recognition of his lasting and significant contributions to the University. A champion of higher education and research, Mr. Clark played a key role in toplevel advancement efforts. He endowed the David D. Thompson Distinguished Professorship of Pathology at Weill Cornell Medical College and, with his brother James, established the Hays and James M. Clark Director of Undergraduate Biology at Cornell's Ithaca campus. Mr. Clark achieved a distinguished record in public and professional life as executive president of Avon Products, Inc., and president of the company's international division, president of the Penzance Foundation, and trustee emeritus of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation. Cornell University expresses its sincere condolences to his wife, Rosamond; his brother, James; his sons, Lawrence and Harris; his daughter, Valerie; his grandchildren and nephews. Peter C.

The Board of Governors, Trustees, staff and members of Boys & Girls Clubs of America wish to express their profound sorrow over the passing of Mr. Hays Clark, our longtime Governor, friend, supporter and a true champion for children. Hays Clark was quite simply the greatest philanthropist in Boys & Girls Clubs of America's century-long history. He was a humanitarian without peer, a man of great vision and deep compassion. Hays expected nothing in return for his generosity, except results that would benefit the young people for whom he cared so deeply. Across four decades, Hays Clark had a profound impact on the Boys & Girls Club Movement, creating a powerful legacy that will last for generations. We are gratified that everyone who walks into our beautiful Hays & Ros Clark National Headquarters Building in Atlanta for many years to come will learn about Hays, a giant of a man whose like will not be seen again soon. A recipient of the Herbert Hoover Humanitarian Award from Boys & Girls Clubs of America for his passionate commitment to America's youth, Hays' contributions to our mission of service will never be forgotten. We will miss him greatly. Boys & Girls Clubs of America Anne Szostak, Chairman Roxanne Spillett, President $(6$)CLARK--Hays. The board and staff of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation mourn the passing of our beloved friend and founding trustee, Hays Clark. The Foundation's work today is a living tribute to and reflection of Hays' unwavering commitment to helping improve the lives of the less fortunate among us. For those who knew and worked with him, he will be deeply missed. For others who only knew him through his legacy, Hays will always be an inspiration. Our deepest condolences are extended to the Clark family. James M. Clark, Jr, Chairman Nancy Roob, President & CEO The Edna McConnell Clark Foundation"

Ganim, went to prison on corruption charges, said he had sought help for his drug problem about 18 months ago and that he had not used drugs since. About four months ago, he added, he stopped drinking alcohol. Mr. Fabrizi's announcement came after The Connecticut Post published an article on June 16 about the contents of an F.B.I. report that was filed earlier this month in federal court in Bridgeport. The report details interviews with a drug suspect, Juan Marrero, who talked to the F.B.I. about Mr. Fabrizi's drug use, the newspaper reported. In 2004, a Democratic Town Committee member asked Mr. Marrero for cocaine because ''Fabrizi was coming over,'' the newspaper reported. The document was quickly sealed by the United States attorney's office, which said it should never have been released."
2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: As a longtime Alice Munro fan, I was eager to read ''Tales of Love and Sorrow in a Singular City'' (Footsteps, June 11). But too often, Mr. Laskin quotes from Ms. Munro's stories that are set in Vancouver to draw intrusive assumptions about her life. On what basis can he conclude that Ms. Munro was ''always oppressed, almost crushed by Vancouver's fabled vistas''? Surely if he wanted to know her feelings, he'd do best to ask her; whatever characteristics Ms. Munro might share with her characters, she is a fiction writer."

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"''A man's home is his castle'' goes the adage, which finds perhaps its most literal representation in the fanciful cottage of Wemmick, a London clerk in Charles Dickens's novel ''Great Expectations.'' Although Wemmick's home is tiny, he has modified it to resemble a Gothic fortress of sorts, complete with a plank drawbridge, a moat and a ''turret bedroom.'' While there is no evidence of a run on Dickens novels in area bookstores, much less a conscious emulation of Wemmick, turrets have been popping up with increasing frequency on upscale suburban homes around New York City."

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"To The Editor: In his review of ''The Good Fight,'' by Peter Beinart (June 11), Joe Klein refers to three ''pillars'' of President Truman's foreign policy as described in his 1949 Inaugural Address: containment by force; salvaging Europe via the Marshall Plan, coupled with a ''humble'' global outlook; and strengthening democracy at home through civil rights and other social programs. Surely Klein should have included a fourth -- Truman's willingness to work with other states multilaterally through regional bodies and international organizations like the I.M.F., World Bank and United Nations (which Truman himself helped create in 1945). Central to his credo was Truman's belief not only that the United States should behave with humility in the world but that it must also be willing to cede some of its sovereignty to make these global associations work.

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"What's the matter, Walter Kirn? Don't you like me? I think I'm a nice guy, just like the teachers and nurses whose money Larry lent you. I work hard, too, and make just about what they do, and now maybe you owe me some of that money because I own 550 shares of a Ginnie Mae mutual fund. You hurt my feelings! All kidding aside, you might romanticize the old S.&L. system, in which all the participants knew one another and banking was done according to the ''3-6-3'' principle(pay 3 percent on passbook savings accounts, charge 6 percent on mortgages and be at the golf course by 3 p.m.), but those days are long gone, and we're better off without them. The securitization of mortgages by bundling them into Ginnie Mae packages is, perhaps, next to the introduction of the 30-year, fixed-rate, fully amortized mortgage, the best thing that has happened to homeowners. It has made the dream ofbuying a home a reality for millions of Americans who might otherwise be lifelong renters. Howard Hirsch Dayton, Nev."

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"A MEMORIAL The News -- Officials in Lower Manhattan unveiled a more modest, and less expensive, design for a memorial at the site of the World Trade Center. Behind the News -- The redesign eliminates underground galleries where the names of the 9/11 victims would be inscribed. Instead, the names will be found on a plaza above the voids where the towers stood. This and other changes will lower the price tag by $162 million. Still, the project is estimated to cost $510 million. A COMMITMENT The News -- Japan announced that it would begin pulling troops out of Iraq. Behind the News -- About 600 soldiers have been in southern Iraq since 2004, providing reconstruction assistance. The contingent is Japan's most significant military mission since World War II. Despite the withdrawal plans, Japan remains a supporter of the American effort in Iraq. Even as he announced that the troops' mission was fulfilled, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said the air force would increase its support flights for American soldiers. A TEAM The News -- It was a bad World Cup for Serbia and Montenegro. Behind the News -- The team, which had performed well in qualifying for the tournament, lost all three of its matches, including a 6-0 shellacking at the hands of Argentina. Worse, though, the team also lost its country: with Montenegro's secession in an independence referendum, Serbia and Montenegro no longer exists. The coach said the political division had a demoralizing effect on the squad. Serbia will begin fielding its own national team next month; the future of Montenegrin soccer is less clear. A CAREER The News -- Dan Rather and CBS News parted ways after 44 years, and Mr. Rather was weighing an offer to work for a fledgling high-definition channel. Behind the News -- CBS announced Mr. Rather's departure -- five months before his contract was to expire -- praising him as one of the giants of television journalism. But Mr. Rather did not hide his displeasure at what he perceived as the network's refusal to give him significant work since he stepped down as anchor of the evening news last year after a reporting scandal. A FAMILY TREE The News -- The pool of Genghis Khan's descendants is not quite as big as thought. Behind the News Although a genetic test had shown that Thomas R. Robinson, an accounting professor in Florida, was descended from the Mongol conqueror, a more complete test showed that the initial result was faulty. The reversal may be a bit of a blow to Mr. Robinson, but it hardly takes the sheen off Genghis's image. He and his relatives amassed so many concubines that, by one estimate, 16 million men in Central Asia carry his Y chromosome."

But really, my husband and I are stealth parents, the ones lingering around the edges of suburban life, the ones who no longer fit into this child-centric universe. We are the empty nesters -- cliché-ridden, childless, but hardly alone. Nationwide, there are about 70 million parents born between 1946 and 1964, and within the next 10 years or so, nearly all of our youngest children will graduate from high school and move on.

Susan spent two decades as an actress, during which she stared as Zenobia, in an Off-Broadway production of ''Ethan Frome.'' She later founded Quoi De Neuf, a fine jewelry business whose pieces grace many of the best dressed women of the world. A woman of impeccable taste, Susan loved all things beautiful. She was a tenacious tennis player, an avid reader, a beach loafer, and a devoted friend, mother and wife. Susan knew how to live life to the fullest and inspired those around her to do the same. Thoughout a courageously fought 16-year battle with cancer, Susan always pursued pleasure and never looked back. She is survived by her adoring husband Peter Hirshfield, her loving daughters, Lauren and Victoria, her beautiful mother Ellen Levy, and her devoted brother Charles Levy.

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Nicholas D. Kristof's brief experiment in trying to inflame China's Internet police (''In China It's ******* vs. Netizens,'' column, June 20) asserts that official censors cannot possibly purge all heterodox material from China's corner in cyberspace. But he vastly oversimplifies the issue, as there is a large and growing number of journalists and cyber-dissidents languishing in Chinese prisons. Mr. Kristof does not mention that the Chinese censors take aim largely based on volume of Web traffic. Small, less popular sites operate with relative impunity. Attract a major following and risk censorship, closure or far worse. Radio Free Asia readers must use cumbersome proxy servers to access uncensored information."

I did not even have an easy option for ''none of the above.''"

2006-06-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Bob Spitz, in his review of ''The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth,'' by Leigh Montville (June 4), gushes: ''No baseball player, despite what record books claim, has ever equaled Ruth's awesome performance.'' If anything, Ruth's records deserve their own asterisk because the greatest black ballplayers of his time were banned from the major leagues.Babe Ruth never had to hit against Satchel Paige or pitch to Josh Gibson (who hit nearly 800 home runs while playing much of his Negro League career in the most cavernous ballparks of that era, Forbes Field and Griffith Stadium). In my view, any major league record set before 1950 should be marked by an asterisk. Spitz also refers to the vagueness surrounding Ruth's family history. Throughout his life Ruth was dogged by rumors of black ancestry, which he neither confirmed nor denied. Indeed, Ty Cobb, an outspoken and notorious racist, openly disparaged Ruth with racial epithets reserved for blacks. The truth of this matter will probably never be known, but the sports journalist Red Smith once remarked that ''Jackie Robinson was not the first black man to play in the major leagues. He was merely the first identifiable one.'' Vaughn A. Carney Stowe, Vt"

2006-06-26T00:00:00Z,"Phelps Dodge, the world's largest copper producer, said today that it had agreed to acquire two of the biggest nickel miners in a huge deal worth $40 billion. The deal, for Inco and Falconbridge, would create a mining behemoth that will reshape the industry as commodity prices continue to soar. The deal comes a day after steel giant Arcelor agreed to merge with Mittal Steel in a $33.5 billion deal. Mining and other commodity-related companies are increasingly seeking to merge to take advantage of the enormous economies of scale involved in the mining and processing of metals. Steel and nickel producers have become particular attractive in the past year as China's appetite for the metals has grown exponentially."

A1 Amir Peretz, left, Israel's newly appointed defense minister, has agreed to ''surgical'' strikes against militants carrying out attacks with Qassam rockets, while fending off calls for a larger military assault on Gaza, by air or land, as advocated by the right. A8 Iraqi Schools Growing Steadily Notwithstanding the violence that has plagued Iraq since the American occupation began three years ago, its schools have been quietly filling. The number of children enrolled in schools nationwide rose by 7.4 percent from 2002 to 2005, and in middle schools and high schools by 27 percent in that time, according to figures from the Ministry of Education. A1 Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki presented a muted ''national reconciliation'' plan that outlined a general direction for his new government but offered neither a broad amnesty for insurgents nor any new options for members of Saddam Hussein's long-ruling Baath Party, the two most heavily disputed items. A10 No Reduction in Western Iraq American troop levels in western Iraq, one of the most dangerous parts of the country, are not expected to decline as part of a plan to make sharp reductions in American combat forces in Iraq by the end of 2007, said Lt. Gen. John F. Sattler, who oversees marines in the Middle East and Central Asia. A10 Taliban Taunts Afghan Leaders A Pakistani television station broadcast an audiotape that it said was the voice of the fugitive Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, contending the Afghan government did not have the wisdom to solve the recently increasing unrest. That unrest included a clash between Afghan and coalition soldiers and a small group of militants that killed an estimated 45 insurgents, according to a coalition statement. A6 New Leader Emerges in Somalia The jockeying for power inside Somalia took a potentially ominous turn as a Muslim sheik, Hassan Dahir Aweys, left, whom the Bush administration has linked to terrorism, was chosen the leader of the Council of the Islamic Court, a newly formed Parliament for the Sharia courts, which ousted Mogadishu's secular warlords. The initial face of the Islamic leadership in Somalia, Sharif Ahmed, had spoken of his desire to work with the West. A6 NATIONAL A12-16 A Boon for Tax Collections In Recovery From Storm State officials assumed that Louisiana's tax base had been battered by last year's hurricanes, but the latest figures show that the opposite occurred: more tax dollars than ever before are pouring into the state's coffers as the budget year draws to an end.

A12 Antipoverty Group Grows With offices in 106 cities and a claimed membership of 200,000, Acorn has emerged in recent years as the largest neighborhood-based antipoverty group in the country, using old-fashioned methods of door-knocking and noisy protests to push for local and national causes. A12 Pfizer Sale in the Works Johnson & Johnson, the health care conglomerate, is close to a deal to expand its household presence by buying the consumer unit of Pfizer, which markets well-known brands like Listerine mouthwash and Sudafed, the cold and allergy medicine, for more than $16 billion, people involved in the deal said.

The deal would create a mining behemoth that will reshape the industry as commodity prices continue to soar.

Now the college says it can no longer afford to support the station and has announced its sale. The new owner?

The store, which draws large crowds for readings by popular authors like Molly Ivins, is holding an open house tomorrow evening to celebrate. RALPH BLUMENTHAL"

2006-06-27T00:00:00Z,"The National People's Congress, China's Parliament, has scrapped a proposal that would criminalize abortions based on the sex of the fetus, the state media reported, despite a growing population imbalance between males and females. Newspapers said lawmakers were divided over criminalizing sex-selective abortions. The original amendment called for fines and prison terms of up to three years for aborting a fetus because of the sex for nonmedical reasons, the reports said. A three-decade-old policy limiting most couples to one child has made abortion a widely used method for controlling family size. As a result, and because of cultural preferences for sons, China faces a growing population imbalance, with many more boys than girls. The New China News Agency said there were now 119 boys born for every 100 girls, a larger gap than the government's previously published figure of 117 boys per 100 girls. Globally, the average ratio is about 105 boys to 100 girls."

The bottom five were Singapore, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Bucharest and Mumbai. FEWER EUROPEANS COMING -- European air passenger traffic to the United States was off more than 9 percent in the first quarter of this year, says Donald N. Martin & Company, citing Commerce Department data. No reasons were suggested for the downturn, after increases of 6.5 percent and 12.1 percent in 2005 and 2004, respectively. One possible benefit, the forecaster says, is that ''more seats may be available for Americans bound for Europe'' this summer, though trans-Atlantic fares are projected to remain high. U.S. SHARE OF WORLD TRAVEL OFF -- In a speech to the Foreign Policy Association last week J. W. Marriott Jr., chairman of Marriott International, noted that while the global travel industry has grown about 30 percent in the last decade, the United States' share of world travel has shrunk by as much as 9 percent. A major reason is that security procedures for obtaining visas abroad are increasingly tangled. The average wait in Brazil for an interview to obtain a visa to visit the United States is 55 days, he said. In 2000, about 737,000 Brazilians traveled to the United States. Last year, only 485,000 came, he said.

2006-06-27T00:00:00Z,"A front-page article on Friday about possible ways to reduce the risk of suffering from lethal injection misstated an effect of a fatal overdose of a barbiturate drug, sodium thiopental. The drug does not cause involuntary jerking movements before death even when used alone. The article also misstated the amount of time that would have to pass in some states before death could be pronounced if a barbiturate alone was used. In states where death is determined by listening for a heartbeat, death could be pronounced in as little as 5 to 10 minutes after the injection, not 45 minutes. It could take up to 45 minutes only in states that use the cessation of electrical activity in the heart to determine death."

2006-06-27T00:00:00Z,"Waiting to expose a baby to cereal grains until after the age of 6 months may increase the risk that the infant will become allergic to wheat, a new study suggests. Researchers followed 1,612 children from birth until an average age of about 4 1/2. The prevalence of wheat allergy among the 958 children exposed to cereal grains before 6 months was 0.41 percent. But among the 654 who were not exposed to grains before that age, it was 1.8 percent, more than four times as high. Of the 16 children who developed the allergy, 12 had not received cereal grains until they were older than 6 months."

The rhythm and progress of Americans' favorite sports are defined by instant, up-to-the-minute, quantifiable results that measure production: yards gained or lost, balls and strikes, points and rebounds."

2006-06-27T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''Video of Ill-Fated Uzbek Rising Offers Haunting, Complex View'' (front page, June 22) notes that the video of the events in Andijon, Uzbekistan, on May 13, 2005, even after heavy editing by the government to suit propaganda purposes, shows that a vast majority of protesters that day were unarmed. It is important to shed light on the protesters' grievances and goals, and equally important is the need for justice for the hundreds killed that day. Even given the presence of some armed people, the Uzbek government flouted its obligation under international law to desist from using disproportionate and certainly lethal force in policing the protest."
2006-06-27T00:00:00Z,"Pedro Martínez used to pitch for the Red Sox, and Willie Randolph used to coach for the Yankees, which meant that they often found themselves in the center of some rather intense moments. At times each said some unprintable words to the other. While the Mets were wooing him during the 2004 off-season, Martínez was curious whether his history with Randolph, selected as the Mets manager six weeks earlier, would diminish his chances of signing with them. Obviously, the answer was no, but Martínez made a point of speaking to General Manager Omar Minaya about it during the early stages of the courtship."

Jamie Foxx, ever the Renaissance man, has earned five nominations -- including best male R&B artist and best male actor -- for these awards honoring achievements by African-Americans and other members of minorities in music, sports and entertainment. But it's Damon Wayans, as host of this ceremony broadcast live from Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, who pulls off the evening's big coup: he'll present the humanitarian award to Harry Belafonte and the lifetime achievement award to the inimitable Chaka Khan. The festivities begin at 6 when ''106 and Park'' points its cameras at fabulosity radiating from the red carpet. And at 11, in ''The Black Carpet Lounge: BET Awards Post Show,'' the winners -- and we're guessing that means you, Mr. Foxx (above, with Mary J. Blige, also a nominee) -- will speak. 7:30 P.M. (IFC) YO SOY BORICUA, PA'QUE TU LO SEPAS! In some sense, Puerto Ricans are neither here nor there. They are citizens of the United States but don't vote for the president.

Parts 3 and 4 of this documentary based on Mark Bowden's book about the Iran hostage crisis examines President Jimmy Carter's authorization of an Army rescue mission and, at 9, negotiations as the 1980 presidential elections approached that led to the release of hostages only minutes after Ronald Reagan was sworn in. 9 P.M.

Once a model of independence and economic success, the country has slid into a quagmire of poverty and terror as its 82-year-old president, Robert Mugabe (above), has metamorphosed from liberation hero to Africa's longest-standing dictator. In this ''Frontline/World'' documentary, Alexis Bloom and Cassandra Herrman pose as tourists to meet secretly with opposition leaders, dissidents and people merely struggling to survive a country plunged into darkness and deceit.

Ubel's findings are consistent with what we know about people's willingness or unwillingness to make different types of errors. In a classic game-show puzzle, a contestant picks one of three doors; the host, who knows where the prize is, then opens another door to show no prize, and asks the contestant if he would like to switch his choice to the other closed door.

Brennan, examined 84 drug offenders prosecuted by her office who have asked for resentencing since the laws were changed in 2004. The offenders had been convicted of possessing or selling enough hard drugs to make them eligible for sentences of at least 15 years to life."

2006-06-28T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (CBS) SHARK: MIND OF A DEMON WITH FABIEN COUSTEAU -- With the Cousteau blood running through his veins, it was perhaps inevitable that Fabien Cousteau, son of Jean-Michel and grandson of Jacques Yves, would heed the call of the ocean. But it was ''The Adventures of Tintin: Red Rackham's Treasure,'' whose cover has a submersible in the shape of a shark on it, that inspired his latest adventure. Mr. Cousteau went on to build the craft (above) and then to spend the next two years in it, swimming with the Great White off Isla Guadalupe, Mexico. The result is this hourlong special that Mr. Cousteau hopes will give one of nature's most maligned creatures a much-needed break. 8 P.M.

Inspired by the death of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Mitchell decided it was his turn to give others, especially children in Harlem, a chance to dance. Teaching in a remodeled garage, he helped to found Dance Theater of Harlem in 1969. This special honors the organization's legacy with performances by Harolyn Blackwell, the Rev. Al Green, Audra McDonald and LeAnn Rimes as well as some of the students (above) Dance Theater has taught to soar. 10 P.M.

2006-06-28T00:00:00Z,"A federal judge in Los Angeles has unsealed three search warrants that investigators used to raid Anthony Pellicano's detective agency and seize evidence in the early stages of what has become a sprawling wiretapping and conspiracy case. The first warrant, on Nov. 19, 2002, covered records that could illuminate Mr. Pellicano's involvement in threats that summer against Anita Busch, a reporter for The Los Angeles Times, and Ned Zeman, a writer for Vanity Fair; both were working on articles about the actor Steven Seagal's possible ties to organized-crime figures. When investigators found explosives and firearms in a safe in Mr. Pellicano's office, they went back two days later with a warrant for more evidence of violations of explosives laws. A few days later, the warrants show, Ms. Busch told the F.B.I. that she had discovered, in repeated calls to the phone company about trouble on her lines, that her phones had been tapped for months, and that the phone company could not explain the taps. On Jan. 14, 2003, the F.B.I. returned to Mr. Pellicano's offices specifically combing through his files, computers and other equipment for all wiretapping evidence. DAVID M.

2006-06-28T00:00:00Z,"Harper Lee Writes Again Ever since Harper Lee's novel, ''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' was published in 1960 and went on to sell 2.5 million copies in its first year and win the Pulitzer Prize, the author has led a low-profile life. Ms. Lee, now 80, has published virtually nothing of significance since then except a 1983 book review. But now she has written something for publication. It is a letter for O, the Oprah Winfrey magazine, about how she became a reader as a child in a rural, Depression-era Alabama town, The Associated Press reported. In the magazine's July ''special summer reading issue,'' Ms. Lee recalls becoming a reader before she entered first grade. Older sisters and a brother read to her; her mother read her a story a day; her father read her newspaper articles. ''Then, of course, it was Uncle Wiggily at bedtime,'' Ms. Lee writes of the popular old-time children's character, right. She notes that books were scarce in the 1930's in the town, Monroeville, where she still lives part time; and the scarcity of books in a town without movies and parks made them a special treasure. ''Now,'' she writes, ''75 years later in an abundant society where people have laptops, cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod along with books.'' Axl Rose Arrested in Stockholm Axl Rose, below, the Guns N' Roses frontman, was arrested yesterday and accused of biting a security guard in the leg after a night of partying that followed a concert in the Globe Arena in Stockholm, The Associated Press reported. A police spokeswoman, Towe Hagg, said Mr. Rose, 44, had been held on suspicion of attacking and threatening the guard and damaging the Berns Hotel. ''He was deemed too intoxicated to be questioned right away,'' she said. The origin of the incident was unclear, but Swedish newspapers said the guard had tried to intervene when Mr. Rose began to argue with a woman in the hotel lobby. The Web site of the newspaper Aftonbladet (aftonbladet.se) quoted Fredrik Nylen, a police officer, as saying that Mr. Rose acted aggressively toward the police and had to be ''handcuffed and restrained.'' Officer Nylen said, ''He kept a high profile, so to speak.'' The penalty for violent conduct could be as high as four years in prison; conviction for a misdemeanor might bring six months in prison or a fine, Reuters reported. China Finances Theater In West Africa China is plowing $35 million into the construction of the biggest theater in West Africa, an 18,000-seat three-level structure with parking for 3,000 cars in Senegal, Reuters reported. The project was described by Pierre Goudiaby Atépa, an architect and adviser to President Abdoulaye Wade. China also plans to build an arts museum in Senegal before the end of next year. The announcement comes as China seeks to strengthen political and economic ties in Africa as it pursues oil and raw materials for its fast-growing economy. After Mr. Wade visited China last week, China announced $20 million in debt relief for Senegal. Free Summer Parks Shows Theater and dance are being added this summer by the CityParks Foundation to a program of free performances that already includes the CityParks Concerts and the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival. In the theater program, five troupes, including Classical Theater of Harlem, Hip Hop Commedia and Liza Jessie Peterson, will offer 15 public performances in Von King, Maria Hernandez and Sunset Parks in Brooklyn and Marcus Garvey Park in Manhattan.

Don Halperin was the beloved son of Gladys and the late Charles Halperin; devoted husband of Brenda; father of Jeremy and Rebecca and future-son-inlaw Joshua Burch; brother of Susan and Alan Gorman; and uncle of Sam Gorman. A graduate of Rutgers University and Brooklyn Law School, Don was a partner in the law firm of Kantor, Davidoff, Wolfe, Mandelker & Kass, PC. He represented the shorefront communities of Brooklyn in the NYS Senate for 23 years, with 13 years as the Ranking Democrat on Finance Committee. In 1993, former Governor Mario Cuomo named Don to the dual positions of Commissioner of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) and Housing ''Czar'', a cabinet level position. Don Halperin was the ultimate consensus builder, a skilled negotiator who had the uncanny ability to relate to all people, bringing the most diverse and opposing factions together to reach satisfying resolutions to thorny issues and debates. His sharp sense of humor and amazing wit earned him friends across the political spectrum. His work ethic and dedication to the people of New York earned him the respect of all his colleagues. As a result, Don Halperin had more bills signed into law than most members of the Minority Party in the Senate achieving a record 22 chapters in 1978. During his legislative career Don Halperin authored a law requiring braille and audio signals in elevators and was a leading advocate for child welfare and criminal justice. He authored the Rapid Transit Noise Code Act on elevated trains and subways. He was a pioneer in developing legislation to revamp the NYS Reverse Mortgage Law and wrote a law to provide grants to finance programs to reduce and prevent racial and cultural conflicts in schools. During his illness Don Halperin advocated and secured passage of significant affordable housing legislation, (Chapter 714 of the Laws of 2005) which provides more realistic evaluation and assessment rates on rental properties with restricted income issues. Funeral Services will be on Wednesday, June 28th, 2006 at 1PM at Parkside Memorial Chapel, 2576 Flatbush Ave, Brooklyn. The family will sit shiva at their home, 118 Hastings Street, Wednesday evening; Thursday and Friday afternoon after 1PM, Saturday evening and Sunday and Monday afternoon starting at 1PM. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions in Donald Halperin's name be made to: Shirley Applebaum Heart League; Menorah Nursing Home and Hospital; or the Lung Cancer Alliance. $(6$)HALPERIN--Donald M. The members, counsel and employees of Kantor, Davidoff, Wolfe, Mandelker & Kass, P.C. mourn the passing of our partner, friend and collegue, Donald M. Halperin.

He held that office for 23 years, rising to ranking member of that body's Higher Education, Insurance & Finance committees. In 1993 he was named Director of Housing for New York State and Commissioner of the Divison of Housing and Community Renewal. Don Halperin was beloved and trusted by both sides of the aisle in city and state government. His sunny disposition, incisive mind and fierce loyalty well served his constituents, while he held public office, and his many clients whom he served as a lobbyist once he left public office.

Laloo's, a company in Petaluma, Calif., introduced ice creams in those flavors last year, but they were sold only in West Coast stores or online. Now they are also sold at Gourmet Garage and Whole Foods stores. Vanilla snowflake, delicately sweetened, is a classic flavor. Not so the intriguingly tangy chèvre chiffon made with goat cheese. Strawberry darling has a swirl of balsamic vinegar. The chocolate-cabernet will not be made again until grapes ripen in the fall, but until then Laloo's deep chocolate flavor is a suitably delectable stand-in. Pumpkin spice and molasses tipsycake would tempt me in cold weather."
2006-06-28T00:00:00Z,"MOSS--Dr. Melvin L. Former dean of Columbia University Medical Center's College of Dental Medicine, professor emeritus of anatomy and oral biology in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and professor emeritus of dentistry, passed away on Sunday, June 25, 2006. Dean Moss' visionary leadership shaped the school we have today, and his death is a great loss to us all. Dean Moss was a 1946 graduate of Columbia's dental school, and received his PhD in anatomy, specializing in physical anthropology from Columbia in 1954. He joined the Columbia faculty in 1952, and was well known throughout the medical center as an outstanding teacher of human anatomy to generations of medical and dental students. A prolific researcher, Dean Moss' work on the theoretical basis of craniofacial growth and development received international recognition. His appointment in 1968 to lead the dental school initiated a period of renewal and new directions in the dental school. Under his leadership, the school received more resources for strengthening dental education through investment in facilities and faculty recruitment. Dean Moss also made significant changes to the curriculum, and oversaw the creation of several new divisions with the dental school. Our thoughts and prayers are extended to his wife and our colleague, Dr. Letty Moss-Salentijn, professor of dentistry and senior associate dean in the College of Dental Medicine, to his two sons, Noel and James, and to his granddaughter Kristina. A memorial service will be held on Wednesday, June 28, 2006, at 11:15 A.M. at The Riverside, Amsterdam Avenue & 76th Street, NYC. Interment will be private. In lieu of flowers, Dr. Moss-Salentijn has requested that donations be made to The Melvin L. Moss Scholarship Fund, payable to Columbia University College of Dental Medicine, 630 West 168 St., New York, NY 10032. Ira B. Lamster, D.D.S., M.M.Sc.

It's not smoked or highly spiced, it's made in a pot on a stove, it's available ready to eat, and while it's delicious piled on a bun for a picnic, a platter of it would also draw raves at a terrace buffet. Because New Yorkers tend to prefer lean first-cut brisket to the richer and fattier second cut, Stanley Lobel has come up with this new item using the top section of the second cut. He pots the soft-textured meat and mixes it with Lobel's mild honey-based barbecue sauce. It fairly falls apart, sort of like pulled beef.

2006-06-28T00:00:00Z,"THERE is an essential truth about cold cooked meat that's revealed in a brisket sandwich -- what I call the brisket code. It goes like this: Even unadorned by gravy, hot brisket can be succulent and flavorful, but the next day, when it's cold and you're thinking it should be perfect for a sandwich, it turns out that it's become a sad, bland bit of business. You have to slather on horseradish to bring it back to life. Otherwise you might as well be eating bologna. I keep the brisket code in mind whenever I cook meat the night before to serve cold or at room temperature the next day, which is pretty much my standard for summer soirées, picnics or potlucks. Since the flavors of something cold are usually less pronounced than when they were warm, and since flavors are always muted during storage anyway, the key is to start with more flavor: a blast of herbs, a rub or a marinade."

For many years, he lived in London but returned to the United States in the 70's,retired and lived in Woodstock, VT. In 2005, in failing health, he moved permanently to NYC to live at the home of his former wife and life-long friend, Judith Woodfin, who survives him. David leaves his and Judy's son, Tom Kaplan, a daughter, Anne of London, seven grandchildren, four greatgrandchildren, and his sister, Roslyn Brecher. Another son, James, died many years ago. A gentle man and an erudite gentleman, he loved history, literature, music, art, travel and gardens. He was an indefatigable correspondent with friends all over the world. He leaves sweet memories. The burial will be private. Any donations in his name can be made to the Visiting Nurse Service of New York Hospice Care. $(6$)KAPLAN--B. David.

2006-06-29T00:00:00Z,"The outsiders are on the outside, none more than Uruguay, the only one of the seven nations that have won the World Cup not preparing to play in the quarterfinals of the 2006 tournament. Some would say that order has been restored to soccer's universe as six teams from Europe and two from South America will play for a spot in the final in Berlin on July 9. Only four years ago the quarterfinals were a revelation, but five of those teams are missing: the United States, South Korea and Spain; Senegal and Turkey did not qualify for the 2006 World Cup. By JACK BELL QUARTERFINAL MATCHUPS GERMANY-ARGENTINA Both countries have won the tournament as hosts: Germany in 1974, Argentina in 1978. And this game has the feel of a final - Argentina beat West Germany for the title in Mexico in 1986, and West Germany turned the tables in Italy in 1990. The Germans have looked unbeatable at home; Argentina has simply looked unbeatable. After yielding two goals in the opener, Germany's much-maligned defense has had shutouts the past three games while Miroslav Klose has scored four goals in the tournament. The Argentines have a deep roster that mixes experience and youth. Lionel Messi and Carlos Tevez, starters on nearly any team in the world, are reserves for Argentina. EDGE: Argentina ITALY-UKRAINE Playing in its first World Cup as an independent nation, Ukraine has given its 23 players a shared $8 million bonus for making the quarterfinals. Ukraine is the only team to lose its first game of the tournament and still be playing. It should surprise no one that Italy, with a savvy stalwart defense and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, has yielded only one goal in four games. It often seems the Italians find an operatic way to tease and then vanquish the opposition. EDGE: Italy ENGLAND-PORTUGAL England's Wayne Rooney said he was ready to play 90 minutes, or more, after bouncing back from a broken foot. David Beckham's lethal free kicks have obscured an offense that is struggling. England has only won the Cup as host in 1966, and it has been 40 years in the wilderness since. Portugal has received a boost from the veteran Luís Figo, but it will be without the suspended Deco and Costinha. EDGE: Portugal BRAZIL-FRANCE The old men of Europe (France) against the defending champion (Brazil). A rematch of the 1998 final, won by host France, 3-0. That was eight years ago, and while the French team includes the veteran holdovers Zinédine Zidane, Patrick Vieira, Lilian Thuram and Fabien Barthiez, the young Brazilian stallions Ronaldinho, Adriano and Kaká will be hard to stop.

2006-06-29T00:00:00Z,"Dead Shark Not Aging Well Has Damien Hirst's famous shark in formaldehyde outlived its youthfulness? Because the work has deteriorated sharply since first seen at the Saatchi Gallery in London in 1992, Mr. Hirst is in discussions with the owner to replace it, The Art Newspaper reported. Not only is the shark's skin showing signs of wear and tear, but the fish has also changed shape, and the solution surrounding it has become murky, the newspaper said. The piece, titled ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living, 1991,'' was commissioned by the British collector Charles Saatchi from Mr. Hirst for £50,000 (now about $91,000) and was sold to the American hedge fund manager Steve Cohen in 2004 for a reported $11.85 million. In a statement Mr. Hirst's company, Science Ltd., said, ''Damien will happily help to refurbish as he would with any of his works that are over 10 years old.'' Larry Gagosian, the gallery owner who brokered the 2004 deal, said: ''The shark is a conceptual piece and to substitute a shark of equal size and appearance, in my opinion does not alter the piece. Steve Cohen is very happy with the piece and is not troubled at all with having to substitute it.'' Toronto 'Rings' to Close ''The Lord of the Rings,'' the $24-million musical adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkein's fantasy trilogy, will end its run on Sept. 3 at the Princess of Wales Theater in Toronto, where it began an open-ended engagement on March 23.

''The upcoming summer shows will be our last. As of now, there are no plans for future tours or recordings.'' Sleater-Kinney will play at Webster Hall in Manhattan on Aug. 2 and give its final performance at Lollapalooza in Grant Park in Chicago on Aug. 4. BET Winners Mary J.

The owner truly ''owns'' the unit, versus owning shares in a co-op structure. This is why there is no formal board approval process even though in some cases the building may have some preemption rights. With regard to Cons, there are important taxes to consider.

Removal of the restrictions, which relate largely to an obligatory reserve requirement of assets in capital transactions, will make it easier for investors to move money in and out of the country. The move had originally been scheduled for 2007, but President Vladimir V. Putin said in an annual address in May that given the strong stance of the Russian economy, his government would accelerate the process. Analysts noted that the move still had to be approved by Parliament, and that the ruble would become truly convertible only when trust in the currency rose. ALEXANDER NURNBERG (NYT)"
2006-06-30T00:00:00Z,"One of the bigger disappointments of the year was the cancellation of an installation called ''77 Drum'' by the always-fascinating Japanese avant-garde band the Boredoms. It was to have been an arrangement of 77 drum sets -- to be used ''as artwork, architecture and principally for activation,'' the announcement read, with typical Boredoms mystery -- next month at Deitch Projects, a gallery in SoHo. Logistical considerations kept it from opening, and the band, already with plans to visit New York, booked a night at Webster Hall. Led by Yamataka Eye, a man who could seemingly outrun, outshout and generally outdo Daffy Duck, the group has, over two decades, gone from playing a screamy and inhumanly manic kind of cartoon rock to creating long-form, slightly slower drones that rise to ecstatic and, inevitably, screamy heights. Recently it has developed an intriguing drum fetish, with Mr. Eye stepping out of the spotlight a bit as three drummers, including Yoshimi, above, pound beefy, menacing tribal rhythms. What they might have accomplished with ''77 Drum'' is mind-boggling. But as anyone who has ever seen the band knows, a Boredoms show is never a disappointment. They play with Lightning Bolt, a Boredoms-influenced duo from Providence, R.I., that makes glorious rainbows of noise with just bass, drums and vocals.

Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater. Previews and Openings 'SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS' In previews. Opens on Thursday. Based on historical fact, José Rivera's new play is about two days that Che Guevera spent trapped in a one-room schoolhouse. A co-production with the Labyrinth Theater company. John Ortiz and Patricia Velasquez star. (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. 'SUMMER PLAY FESTIVAL' Starts Wednesday. Through July 30. Fifteen emerging playwrights, including Peter Morris and Etan Frankel, strut their stuff in this eclectic annual showcase. Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, Special Theatrical Event 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, Best Play and Best Direction of a Play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, Best Direction of a Musical 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'BURLEIGH GRIME$' A feeble-witted comedy by Roger Kirby about dirty dealings on Wall Street, featuring a pair of skilled actors known for recent television work -- Wendie Malick of ''Just Shoot Me'' and Mark Moses of ''Desperate Housewives'' -- and incidental music by David Yazbek, who wrote the score for Broadway's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' These putative assets are painfully ill served by Mr. Kirby's play, which is long on ludicrous plot and short on fresh humor. (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE BUSY WORLD IS HUSHED' With the Episcopal church in a tizzy about homosexuality and that intriguing new gospel of Judas the subject of much speculation, Keith Bunin's play about conflicts of family and of faith arrives at a propitious moment. Jill Clayburgh stars as an Episcopal minister with a troublesome son and what may be an undiscovered Gospel. Engaging, if a little too tidy (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) 'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will and Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231.(George Hunka) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE WATER'S EDGE' In a bold surgical endeavor that recalls the experiments of the mad Dr. Frankenstein, Theresa Rebeck has tried to transplant the big, blood-engorged heart of a Greek tragedy into the slender body of a modest American comic drama. The resulting hybrid runs amok in a stylishly acted production, directed by Will Frears and starring Kate Burton and Tony Goldwyn (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ARABIAN NIGHT' A blonde in a German apartment building sleeps too much; the super takes an unexpected trip to the desert; and a peeping Tom is properly punished in this stylish comedy whose title turns out to make perfect sense (1:05). The East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Gates) 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright, Yussef El Guindi, addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after Sept. 11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger) 'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16; closes on Sunday. (Hunka) 'ELVIS AND JULIET' This opposites-collide tale by Mary Willard and starring her husband, the television actor Fred Willard, looks like community theater and is just as unoriginal. The title characters are young lovers, he the son of an Elvis impersonator, she the daughter of overeducated snobs. Fred dons an Elvis suit, but it's not enough (2:15). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'GETTING HOME' Anton Dudley's Valentine's Day card to New York, in which three lonely lovers finally find love in unexpected places, directed by David Schweizer. Determinedly angst-free (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 246-4422; closes tomorrow. (Hunka) 'THE GOLD STANDARD' A successful alumnus, his trophy girlfriend and an eccentric Korean professor form a romantic triangle at a campus bar in Daniel Roberts's drama, which is occasionally original but often downright odd (2:30). The Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Gates) 'THE HOUSE IN TOWN' A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, back in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) * 'THE MOST WONDERFUL LOVE' Blue Coyote Theater Group has a rollicking good time with this inventive tale of domestic disintegration by Matthew Freeman. Mother (Lenni Benicaso) and Father (Frank Anderson), after long years together, decide to ''unmarry,'' which isn't quite the same as divorce but just as unsettling for their already unsettled youngest child (Josephine Stewart). But that doesn't begin to convey how nutty this play is. Access Theater, 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger) 'NERVE' In Adam Szymkowicz's romantic comedy, an online couple's first date is a frightening but satisfyingly comic escalation of confessions and demands (1:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow.(Gates) 'NOTHING' A morsel of catnip for Anglophiles, flavorfully adapted by Andrea Hart from the novel by Henry Green. Simon Dutton and Sophie Ward play onetime lovers contemplating the possible marriage of their children in this comedy of manners about the string of upheavals that a romance in one generation causes in another (1:40). The 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'SATELLITES' This tough-minded, soft-hearted and very likable play by Diana Son (''Stop Kiss'') portrays a world in which traditional ethnic, social, economic and sexual boundaries have become so porous that people are never quite sure who or where they are. Sandra Oh and Kevin Carroll play a couple who move into a Brooklyn brownstone that refuses (literally) to stay still. Michael Greif directs the appropriately fluid ensemble. (1:40). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'STOPPING TRAFFIC' The actress Mary Pat Gleason's endearing one-woman show about making movies (and just getting through life) while bipolar is a play with both a message and some hearty laughs (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303; closes on Sunday. (Gates) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott) * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis) 'THE BLOOD OF MY BROTHER' (No rating, 84 minutes, in English and Arabic) Another documentary about the occupation of Iraq; another heartbreak; another protest; another dead brother; another necessity. (Nathan Lee) 'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott) 'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis) * 'CAVITE' (No rating, 80 minutes, in English and Tagalog) Terrorism and cultural identity are only two of the themes wound into a tight knot of fear and bewilderment in this gripping, no-budget political thriller shot on the fly with hand-held cameras that scour the teeming streets and squatter shacks of Cavite, a city on the outskirts of Manila. (Stephen Holden) 'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis) * 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet, and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright, and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott) * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden) 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Lee) * 'GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS' (No rating, 103 minutes) Affected but elegant, this digital video ''Death in Venice'' follows an art historian and her lover as they grapple, frequently in the buff, with life, death and the iconography of Bosch. (Lee) 'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES' (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis) 'THE HIDDEN BLADE' (R, 132 minutes, in Japanese) Set in 1861 at the tail end of Japanese feudalism, ''The Hidden Blade'' focuses on a gentle samurai balancing his love for a low-caste servant girl and his mission to kill a traitorous friend. By taking samurai-movie conventions and placing them in the harsh light of daily survival, the director, Yoji Yamada, is illuminating the twilight of an entire way of life. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden) 'THE KING' (R, 105 minutes) James Marsh uses clichés and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere for his fitfully engaging, exasperating film about a young Mexican-American (Gael García Bernal) whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family (headed by a very fine William Hurt). (Dargis) 'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott) 'LAND OF THE BLIND' (R, 111 minutes) Watching this simplistic Orwellian fable set in a composite Everycountry that swings politically from extreme right to extreme left is like poring over a quadruple exposure. It's a jumble of ideas and images. (Holden) 'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden) 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis) * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden) * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis) 'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden) 'ONLY HUMAN' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Spanish) When a Jewish girl takes her Palestinian fiancé home to meet the parents, the encounter sets off a series of zany, romantic and potentially tragic misadventures during one eventful night in Madrid. (Laura Kern) 'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis) * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott) * 'ROOM' (No rating, 75 minutes) Engulfed by nightmares, blackouts and the anxieties of the age, a Texas woman flees homeland insecurity for a New York vision quest in this acute, resourceful and bracingly ambitious debut film. (Lee) 'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden) 'SAY UNCLE' (R, 90 minutes) A comedy about a suspected gay pedophile is something even Mel Brooks might balk at, but ''Say Uncle'' would have benefited from his ability to turn bad taste into a good feature. When a childlike artist (Peter Paige, who also writes and directs) indulges his unhealthy, if innocent, interest in other people's children, a lynch mob of local moms is formed to hunt him down. Aspiring to address gay persecution and social paranoia, the movie mostly comes off as a study of arrested development. (Catsoulis) 'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis) * 'TWO DRIFTERS' (No rating, 98 minutes, in Portuguese) From the dexterous mind of João Pedro Rodrigues comes a bizarre love triangle like no other. Two gay boys (one of whom is dead) are reunited with the help of an enigmatic girl on roller skates in a metaphysical melodrama about grief, love, hysterical pregnancy and the transmigration of souls. (Lee) 'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis) 'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden) * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis) 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis) Film Series AFRO-PUNK WEEKEND (Through Tuesday) BAMcinématek's second annual program of films about revolution begins today. Films to be screened include Sandra Dickson and Churchill Roberts's ''Negroes With Guns'' (2004), the story of Robert Williams, a founder of the Black Panthers and advocate of armed resistance; ''Paris Is Burning'' (1990), Jennie Livingston's portrait of drag queens and self-invention; and ''Punk: Attitude'' (2005), a documentary about the origins of punk from Don Letts, co-founder of the band Big Audio Dynamite. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) ESSENTIAL WILDER (Through July 20) Film Forum's three-week retrospective of the work of the great Polish-born director and screenwriter Billy Wilder (1906-2002) begins today and tomorrow with ''Double Indemnity'' (1944), Wilder's noir classic about an insurance salesman (Fred McMurray) and an alluring married woman (Barbara Stanwyck), who hatch a murder plot with a big payoff. Sunday's feature is the comedy masterpiece ''Some Like It Hot'' (1959), about an all-women band that includes Marilyn Monroe and, strangely enough, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-9110; $10. (Gates) STANLEY KUBRICK RETROSPECTIVE (Through July 9) The Museum of the Moving Image's five-week series continues this weekend with ''A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), starring Malcolm McDowell as a young, violent type from the near future, and ''Barry Lyndon'' (1975), Kubrick's Thackeray adaptation starring Ryan O'Neal as an 18th-century Irish social climber. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues Sunday and Tuesday with ''Yojimbo'' (1961), starring Toshiro Mifune as a 19th-century samurai drifter who manipulates two rival gangsters. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates) NEW YORK ASIAN FILM FESTIVAL (Through tomorrow) Subway Cinema's fifth annual festival of high-grossing and/or award-winning new movies concludes tomorrow at the ImaginAsian Theater. The final films include ''Beetle the Horn King'' (2005), a Japanese sci-fi movie about Mexican wrestlers, and ''Linda Linda Linda'' (2005), the story of Japanese high school girls (and one Korean) who form a band. 239 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 371-6682; $9. (Gates) NORDIC NOIR: CRIME DRAMAS FROM SWEDEN AND DENMARK (Through Aug. 10) The American Scandinavian Foundation is screening ''Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander Mysteries,'' television films written by Mr. Mankell, the author of the internationally best-selling Wallander novels. In ''Mastermind,'' to be shown Wednesday and Thursday, a criminal has infiltrated the detective's hometown police station. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * BELLE AND SEBASTIAN (Tuesday) For a decade now, these members of Scottish indie royalty have made some of the most tasteful chamber pop on the planet: calm and elegant and clever, though sometimes a little bloodless. But the band loosened up a bit for its latest, ''The Life Pursuit'' (Matador), adding some bluesy vamps and -- could it be? -- some rock 'n' roll. At 3:30 p.m., the Lawn at Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free, but tickets are required. (Ben Sisario) KURTIS BLOW (Thursday) The City Parks Foundation's series of free concerts in parks throughout the five boroughs begins in Brooklyn with Kurtis Blow, who became one of the first heroes of rap with strutting and innocently street-smart rhymes like ''The Breaks'' (''Brakes on a bus, brakes on a car/ Breaks to make you a superstar''). At 7 p.m., Von King Park, Marcy and Tompkins Avenues, Bedford-Stuyvesant, (212) 360-8290; free. (Sisario) BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE (Thursday) This Toronto collective has mastered a kind of free-associative indie-prog, following melodies and rhythmic patterns along endlessly fascinating tangents. The band plays a benefit concert for the Celebrate Brooklyn series, with the Hidden Cameras, another inventive and well-populated Toronto band. At 6 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 855-7882 or (866) 468-7619; $30. (Sisario) JOHNNY DOWD; MARY LORSON AND SAINT LOW (Thursday) Johnny Dowd applies his stoic Texas twang to songs about passion, sin and death; his band plays a version of honky-tonk that sounds as if it has been dragged through a swamp and encrusted with misfiring electronics. Mary Lorson, who was at the core of the band Madder Rose, has a pensive undertow behind her airy voice, floating in tunes that blend a folky delicacy with the lilt of jazz. Fans of Suzanne Vega or Mazzy Star owe it to themselves to discover her. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $12. (Jon Pareles) FUTUREHEADS (Tonight) The Futureheads, from the northern English city of Sunderland, play tight, nervy and exhilarating little tantrums of guitar, with four-part chants and an endless supply of clever riffs. The band's first album, released two years ago, was one of the best by the many recent bands to resuscitate the angular postpunk of Gang of Four and Wire, and its new one, ''News and Tributes'' (Star Time/Vagrant), shows that it was no accident. With the French Kicks. At 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $22 in advance, $24 at the door. (Sisario) GIPSY KINGS (Thursday) Strumming half a dozen guitars, singing in a husky rasp and stamping their heels on the floor, the members of this French pop group are to flamenco what Rice-a-Roni is to paella. Which is not to say that some of their international hits, like ''Bamboleo,'' aren't fiendishly catchy. At 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888)466-5722; $31.50 to $81.50. (Pareles) * JOSÉ GONZÁLEZ, JUANA MOLINA, PSAPP (Monday) Connoisseurs of hip television soundtracks might recognize some of the music on this bill. José González, an Argentinean Swede, plays haunting, austere confessions with precision guitar picking and a deadpan hush; his song ''Crosses'' was played in the soap-opera season finale of ''The OC'' this spring. Juana Molina is another whispery Argentine, whose gentle, swirling lullabies draw a listener directly into her reveries. The English duo Psapp places soft vocals over beats constructed from found sounds like splashing water, creaking floorboards and even squeaking cats, creating a kind of hyperintimate electronica; ''Grey's Anatomy'' uses one of Psapp's songs as its theme. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sisario) JOE JACKSON (Tonight) In songs like ''Is She Really Going Out With Him?'' and ''Steppin' Out'' in the late 1970's and early 80's, Joe Jackson made his reputation as a cold-eyed master of British soul, bringing a cutting new-wave minimalism to stories of lonely lovers who cry that they are ''so tired of all the darkness in our lives.'' Since then he has proved remarkably versatile, releasing, among other projects, settings of the Seven Deadly Sins and a Grammy-winning recording of his Symphony No. 1. At 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; sold out. (Sisario) * SALIF KEITA (Tonight) Salif Keita, from Mali, has long been celebrated for a cosmopolitan ear and a voice that can melt hearts, but lately, with a devotion to acoustic guitars, his work has been even more entrancing than usual. His new album, ''M'Bemba'' (Decca), has songs of love and tribute to ancestors, its guitars joined by instruments from Hawaii, the Caribbean and even medieval Europe. At 8, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; $39 and $49. (Sisario) ANGÉLIQUE KIDJO, VUSI MAHLASELA (Tomorrow) Angélique Kidjo, from Benin, has a raw, gutsy voice, charisma that lights up a stage, and the determination to reach the world. Vusi Mahlasela was one of the most important songwriters of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, not just for his political courage but also for his sterling voice and for three-chord rockers that make earnest sentiments bounce. At 7 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Pareles) BAABA MAAL (Sunday) Baaba Maal, one of the great singers and bandleaders from Senegal, merges the incantatory vocals and twinkling guitar lines of griot songs with elements of rock, reggae and Afro-Cuban music.

Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $64.50 to $354.50 . (Sisario) MATES OF STATE (Thursday) Most of the time Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel, the married couple who make up Mates of State, sing insistent, almost nagging chants propelled by quick-pulse organ and drums; their latest, ''Bring It Back'' (Barsuk), also has some soothing, affectionate piano songs. At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789. Free; tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Sisario) MIDSUMMER NIGHT SWING (Tonight through Thursday) Lincoln Center's annual outdoor series of low-dipping, high-kicking music and dancing continues tonight with western swing by the Bob Wills's Texas Playboys (who have continued since Wills's death 21 years ago); tomorrow features salsa with Alex Torres y Su Orquesta, a 13-piece band; on Tuesday, Jo Thompson sings swing favorites with the J. C. Heard Orchestra; Beth Mead's Big Bandjo, on Wednesday, plays -- can you guess? -- classic swing songs in banjo-led arrangements; and Thursday features plena, the traditional Puerto Rican form of singing, dancing and social commentary, with Plena Libre. At 7:30 p.m., with dance lessons at 6:30 p.m., Josie Robertson Plaza, Columbus Avenue at 63rd Street, (212) 875-5460; $15 each night. (Sisario) AMY RIGBY, ROBBIE FULKS (Tonight) After years in various New York country-rock groups, Amy Rigby emerged on her own. She has made six worthy albums of succinct, tuneful songs about struggling through adulthood, when jobs, romance and motherhood aren't exactly what she'd hoped for. Robbie Fulks is fond of honky-tonk and the Beatles, and he comes up with tuneful, neatly phrased songs about near-psychotic characters. At 7 p.m., South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Pareles) * TV ON THE RADIO, MATT POND PA (Tonight) One of Brooklyn's finest and most consistently intriguing bands, TV on the Radio casts a dark and seductive spell with swirling electronics, washes of Pixies-esque guitar and, most alluringly, vocals that draw from both early Peter Gabriel and doo-wop. The band has a fantastic and long-awaited new album, ''Return to Cookie Mountain,'' which is due to be released by Interscope Records later this year. Matt Pond PA adds some interesting colors to its indie-rock songs with touches of cello and strings. At 6:30, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario) RHONDA VINCENT (Wednesday) Rhonda Vincent sings, plays mandolin and pushes bluegrass in some modern directions without forgetting standards like ''Muleskinner Blues.'' At 7 p.m., Madison Square Park, Madison Avenue and 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 538-6667; free. (Pareles) WALKMEN (Tonight) The Walkmen emerged five years ago, playing exquisitely articulated songs of exhaustion and disaffection, with Hamilton Leithauser's weary whine surrounded by an echoey wash of guitar and keyboards. The band's new album, ''A Hundred Miles Off'' (Record Collection), begins intriguingly, with festive Mexican horns, but pretty soon it's back to the familiar guitar-bleached anguish. At 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $17.50. (Sisario) GARY WILSON AND THE BLIND DATES (Wednesday) The point is often made that not all the bands at CBGB in the late 1970's sounded like the Ramones. But perhaps no one was less like the Ramones than Gary Wilson, who played a kind of shattered lounge music with angst-ridden, unhinged vocals. (He also sometimes wrapped his face in plastic and wore two sets of sunglasses, something that might have actually looked cool on Joey Ramone.) Mr. Wilson disappeared from the scene in the early 80's but has played occasional dates since his re-emergence four years ago. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sisario) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package.(Stephen Holden) * Eartha Kitt (Tonight and tomorrow night) The latest edition of an act Ms. Kitt has been performing for decades is the lightest, swiftest and funniest one to date, and that's all to the good. More than ever, the singer, now a glamorous 79, pauses to poke fun at her status as the greatest and wittiest of all singing tigresses. At 8:45 and 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $100. (Holden) * JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night) A theater singer with jazz chops, Ms. Molaskey combines sophisticated wit, fierce intelligence and a lightly swinging voice that hovers on the keen edge between happy and sad. A hybrid of the bossa nova standard ''Desafinado'' and Billy Joel's ''Summer, Highland Falls'' performed Brazilian style is the pinnacle of a show whose material she describes as ''limbo songs.'' At 9 and 11:30, the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $50 cover; $60 prix fixe dinner required at the 9 p.m. shows; $20 minimum at the late shows.

(Nate Chinen) CYRUS CHESTNUT TRIO (Wednesday through July 8) Mr. Chestnut is a stalwart straight-ahead pianist with a penchant for gospel and blues shadings.

At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25; $30 next Friday and July 8. (Chinen) THE CLARINETS (Tomorrow) Three clarinetists walk into a bar and manage to make music that's not only serious but also mysterious and broadly textured. The clarinetists are Anthony Burr, Oscar Noriega and Chris Speed, and their improvisational chemistry is no joke. At 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen) GEORGE COLLIGAN AND MAD SCIENCE (Tomorrow) Last year Mr. Colligan, a keyboardist with a powerful rhythmic presence, released a modernistic organ trio album called ''Realization'' (Sirocco Music). He pursues a similar purpose here, with the guitarist Tom Guarna and the drummer Kenny Grohowski. At 10 p.m., Ace of Clubs, 9 Great Jones Street, between Broadway and Lafayette Streets, West Village, (212) 677-6963, www.aceofclubsnyc.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) ERIK FRIEDLANDER'S BROKEN ARM (Thursday) This tribute to the bassist Oscar Pettiford and the pianist Herbie Nichols features Mr. Friedlander's pizzicato cello playing against a simple rhythm backdrop of bass (Kermit Driscoll) and drums (Mike Sarin). The name is an oblique reference to Mr. Pettiford; both Mr. Friedlander's arms are fine. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen) BEN GERSTEIN COLLECTIVE (Sunday) Mr. Gerstein, a trombonist, has led this free-improvising ensemble for the last half-dozen years, enlisting bright young players like Jacob Sacks (on keyboards), Eivind Opsvik (on bass) and Jacob Garchik (on accordion and electronics). At 8 and 10 p.m., Bar 4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, www.bar4.net; cover, $5. (Chinen) CURTIS HASSELBRING'S NEW MELLOW EDWARDS/JOHN HOLLENBECK'S CLAUDIA QUINTET (Sunday) Two smart ensembles that harness the forward thrust of rock in the service of an almost chamberlike group cohesiveness. The trombonist Curtis Hasselbring's group is the more raucous of the two; the Claudia Quintet, led by the drummer John Hollenbeck, is the more refined. At 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10.

(Chinen) * PAUL MOTIAN BAND (Through Sunday) This luminous ensemble consists of two contrasting pairs of improvisers (the tenor saxophonists Mark Turner and Chris Cheek, and the guitarists Steve Cardenas and Ben Monder); a couple of stabilizers (Jacob Bro and Jerome Harris, also guitarists); a lone anchor (the bassist Ben Street); and a mastermind (Mr. Motian, on drums). The band's last ECM album was excellent; its last Village Vanguard appearance, in January, was even better. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $25 tonight and tomorrow, $20 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) RALPH PETERSON SEXTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) As a drummer, Mr. Peterson is a steamroller; as a bandleader, he's more like a sergeant. He has a way of producing strong results, as he probably will with this ensemble, featuring the trumpeter Igmar Thomas, the saxophonists Tia Fuller and Donald Lee, and the brotherly team of Zaccai and Luques Curtis on piano and bass. At 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) GONZALO RUBALCABA TRIO (Through Sunday) Mr. Rubalcaba can be an astonishing pianist technically, and he plays with a sense of dramatic flourish instilled by the music of his native Cuba.

At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30; $25 on Sunday.

(Chinen) TYFT (Monday) This adventurous trio -- the guitarist Hilmar Jenssen, the alto saxophonist and bass clarinetist Andrew D'Angelo and the drummer Jim Black -- fashions roughly contoured music out of grainy texture and surging pulse. Their energy level is unflaggingly high, as is the caliber of their musicianship. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen) KEVIN UEHLINGER QUARTET (Wednesday) Biochemistry and the I Ching are hardly common themes in jazz, but Mr. Uehlinger, a keyboardist, has used aspects of both in his compositional framework. He has also employed musicians independent enough to strain against those constrictions: the trumpeter Nate Wooley, the bassist Keith Witty and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen) * RANDY WESTON'S AFRICAN RHYTHMS TRIO/ELDAR (Wednesday through July 9) Mr. Weston, the pianist, has been one of the principal agents of an Africanized jazz aesthetic since his fateful first visit to Nigeria more than 40 years ago. He has an unfailingly expressive outlet in the ensemble African Rhythms, which appears here in trio form. Also on the bill is Eldar, a piano prodigy from Kyrgyzstan celebrating the release of his new trio album, ''Live at the Blue Note'' (Sony Classical), in the most appropriate setting. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

On Monday begins a mere four-performance run (the house will be dark on Tuesday) of Frederick Ashton's ''Sylvia,'' which was a critical hit last summer but which Ballet Theater apparently feels cannot sustain a full week's run. Instead, next weekend, there will be three more performances of ''Le Corsaire.'' The ''Sylvia'' is worth seeing, though, both for itself and to provide a contrast to Mark Morris's version, coming next month with the San Francisco Ballet.

(Dunning) LO-LO LO-LO DANCE PERFORMANCE COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow night) From Japan, the company is making its New York City debut in ''As an Ugly Duck,'' a quintet choreographed by Kazumi Taoka that explores love and force by using bodies, space, eye contact, touching and voice. At 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $15; $10 for students. (Dunning) * JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday; Wednesday and Thursday) The Limón Dance company will be in the larger Ted Shawn Theater through the weekend, followed there on Wednesday and Thursday (and next weekend) by the Suzanne Farrell Ballet from Washington in an all-Balanchine program.

Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass.; (413) 243-0745. (Rockwell) * LA MAMA MOVES! (Tonight through Sunday; Thursday) This eclectic whirl of a downtown-dance festival continues at three theaters in the La MaMa complex with ''Mavericks in Motion,'' whose choreographers include Abby Chen, Bhavani Lee and Deborah Lohse (tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 2:30 p.m.); the highly recommended ''Dancing Divas'' program of choreography by Pat Catterson, Ellen Fisher, Keely Garfield, Sally Gross, Deborah Jowitt, Jodi Melnick, Yvonne Meier and Vicky Shick (tonight at 10); ''Children of Ur,'' which includes dances by Karinne Keithley, David Neuman, Nicky Paraiso and the program curator, Chris Yon (tomorrow at 5:30 p.m.); ''Burlesque,'' whose stars include Julie Atlas Muz and Dirty Martini (tomorrow at 10 p.m.); ''Duet,'' with a roster of five pairs of dancer-choreographers (Sunday at 5:30 p.m.); and ''Border Jumping,'' with work by six artists, including Bill Irwin, representing the United States (Thursday at 7:30 p.m.). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, west of Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 475-7710 or www.lamama.org; $10 (Dunning) NICHOLAS LEICHTER ( Tomorrow) For its 10th-anniversary season, the company Nicholasleichterdance presents four pieces commissioned by Dance New Amsterdam, which date from 1997 (''Animal'') to 2006 (''Sweetwash Special''). It is an opportunity to see how much both the choreographer and Dance New Amsterday, which was formerly known as Dance Space and now has splendid new digs downtown, have grown. At 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200 or www.dnadance.org; $20, or $15 for members. (Erika Kinetz) * NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tonight through Sunday; Thursday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, has settled into the intimate Theater 80 for this month and next, through July 30. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 8; tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m.; Sunday at 5 p.m.; Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45. (Rockwell) * PARADIGM and BATTLEWORKS (Wednesday and Thursday) In their shared week at the Joyce, these two companies bring together some of the best names in modern dance, both old and new. Paradigm will perform works by Carmen deLavallade, Gus Solomons Jr., Wally Cardona, Larry Keigwin and Kay Cummings. Robert Battle's gifted young ensemble will perform ''Primate,'' a world premiere set to music by Philip Hamilton; ''Communion,'' a New York premiere; ''Takademe''; ''Two''; and ''Promenade.'' (Through July 9.) Opening night, Wednesday, is a shared program; Battleworks performs alone on Thursday. Both are at 8 p.m. The Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $30. (Kinetz) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman) COOPER HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'YINKA SHONIBARE SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Sept. 24. A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection, and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Ken Johnson) * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' (See above.) (Glueck) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) * International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual, reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710. (Smith) * met: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710. (Kimmelman) * Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck) Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. One of the most interesting concerns the genteel technique of cut-paper silhouette that is the basis of Ms. Walker's scathing take-no-prisoners exploration of slavery and its tragic legacy. (212) 535-7710. (Smith) * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter) Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3 Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman) Museum of Modern Art: Douglas Gordon: 'Timeline,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. Museum of Modern Art. (212) 708-9400. (Johnson) * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through January. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second in a trio of exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter) New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 19. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith) NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck) Galleries: Uptown * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith) * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street Eva Lundsager: 'Wherever' Improvising with infectiously playful freedom on medium-large canvases, Ms. Lundsager creates hedonistic and trippy abstract landscapes composed of dots, squiggles, woozy stripes, smudgy areas, luminous open spaces, and colors ranging from neon bright to muddy brown. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444, through next Friday. (Johnson) * Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by this young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design; and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Johnson) EVA HESSE: 'DRAWING' This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 15. (Glueck) Galleries: Chelsea 'Nightmares of Summer' This entertaining selection of dark, weird and nasty visions includes Marilyn Minter's big photograph of dirty feet with toenails painted fashionably green; Barnaby Furnas's explosive, cartoonish painting of a woman at the beach spilling blood-red wine; an otherworldly coppery seascape by Stuart Elster; photographs by Anders Petersen, Hans Bellmer and Diane Arbus; drawings by Carroll Dunham and Steve DiBenedetto; and more. Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-3363, through July 8. (Johnson) 'Scarecrow' The work in this show is supposed to be menacing and abrasive, but it is mostly interesting and amusing. Highlights include David Herbert's giant, handmade replica of a ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' videocassette; Rashid Johnson's life-size, photographic nude self-portrait; David Kennedy Cutler's model of the White House made of chewing gum and imbedded in dirt; and a short Matthew Barney-like film by Chris Larson. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212) 727-3323, through July 8. (Johnson) Martin Schoeller: 'Close Up' Extraordinarily large and detailed mug-shot-like portraits of celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Sept. 1. (Johnson) * Stephen Shore The postcard-size color pictures of diners, restaurant meals, hotel rooms, roadside signs, ordinary people and other nondescript subjects taken by this eminent photographer on cross-country road trips in the early 1970's are enthralling, beautiful, nostalgic and romantic. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, through July 7. (Johnson) RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, through Aug. 11. (Smith) Last Chance Jackie Gendel: 'Portraits' With seemingly offhand painterly verve, smudgy colors and a sweet sense of humor, Ms. Gendel creates smart and sensuous, semi-abstract riffs on Modernist portraiture. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156; closing tomorrow. (Johnson) * NEW VIDEO, NEW EUROPE A selection of 49 tapes by 40 artists from 16 Eastern European countries, several of which did not exist before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, presents bits and pieces of another world. Revolution, landmines, economic hardship and disappearing ways of life alternate with wit and artistic originality. The whole forms an inadvertent documentary, but many of the parts are well worth attention. The Kitchen, 512 East 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793; closing today. (Smith) * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed. (One gallery bursts with color, another has a cool, platinum shimmer.) The 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500; closing Sunday. (Cotter)"
2006-06-30T00:00:00Z,"The Supreme Court upheld Arizona's limited approach to the insanity defense on Thursday, ruling that states are not obliged to permit a defendant to argue that mental illness prevented him from forming the requisite intent to commit a crime. The case was brought by an Arizona man who was a teenager suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he shot and killed a police officer. He was convicted of violating a law that makes it a crime to kill a police officer intentionally, and he argued that the delusions caused by his illness had prevented him from forming that specific intent."

2006-06-30T00:00:00Z,"After Sunday night, it will become much more difficult to give advice on what plays to see on Broadway. For the last 15 months, you couldn't go wrong with ''Doubt,'' the rigorously intelligent and beautifully made American play that appealed to highbrows and blue-haired ladies alike. It quickly earned back its investors' money, as well as winning across-the-board raves, not to mention a Pulitzer Prize and an armful of Tony Awards. In a perfect world there would always be a play like ''Doubt'' running on Broadway, but after the initial rush of awards and reviews, maintaining a production without a single show tune can be a daunting task. If ''Doubt'' fell short of the blockbuster status of ''Proof,'' which ran for more than two years on Broadway, the reason has more to do with casting than with the play. While the producers of ''Proof'' renewed interest in the show by plugging in talented actresses like Anne Heche and Jennifer Jason Leigh into the role that Mary-Louise Parker originated, ''Doubt'' never recovered from the loss of its stars, Cherry Jones and Brian F. O'Byrne. Ticket sales plummeted almost immediately, and the mixed reviews for Eileen Atkins and Ron Eldard, above -- excellent performers who have had more success in other productions -- didn't help, either. In the end, no matter how acclaimed ''Doubt'' was, it still needed the right actors to make it go, which is just another illustration of how delicate a Broadway hit can be. Ms. Jones, incidentally, will reprise her role on a tour that begins this fall. As for Broadway, next week will be a little less interesting, there's no doubt about it.

2006-06-30T00:00:00Z,"Jere Longman breaks down a few matchups in today's quarterfinal games. Torsten Frings GERMANY'S DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDER VS. Juan Riquelme ARGENTINA'S PLAYMAKER Juan Riquelme has been a kind of marionette in this World Cup, as if directing everyone else on strings. He is brilliant at slowing the pace and waiting patiently for a chance to put a through ball to forwards Javier Saviola and Hernán Crespo, who has scored three goals in the tournament. Germany says it will not man-mark Riquelme, but Frings should spend considerable time in his shadow. Germany's defense was considered suspect when the World Cup began, but after allowing two goals to Costa Rica in the opener, it has pitched three consecutive shutouts. This could be a classic matchup, one worthy of a final. It will be a reprise of the 1986 final, when Argentina and Diego Maradona defeated Germany, 3-2, and the 1990 final when West Germany defeated Argentina, 1-0, on a penalty kick. Germany will have a huge home-crowd advantage at Olympic Stadium in Berlin. As host, however, Germany did not have to qualify for this World Cup. It has not beaten a top-class opponent in 17 matches since 2000. Germany and Argentina drew, 2-2, twice last year, once in a friendly, once in the Confederations Cup. Argentina appeared vulnerable when Mexico came out swinging in the second round. And the Argentine defense should be tested by the flair of the German forwards Lukas Podolski and Miroslav Klose, who leads the tournament with four goals. Italy VS. Ukraine Italy needed a controversial penalty kick to defeat Australia in the second round, and its rigorous defense will again be without central defender Alessandro Nesta, who has a groin injury. His backup, Marco Materazzi is suspended. So Italy will use 25-year-old Andrea Barzagli in Nesta's spot. Italy has perhaps the most impenetrable defense in the world, but Ukraine's forward Andriy Shevchenko is familiar with all of its players, having played at A.C. Milan in the Italian League until signing recently with Chelsea of the English Premier League. It remains to be seen whether Italy is shaken by continued repercussions from a match-fixing scandal. The new general manager of Juventus, the league champion that is under investigation, apparently tried to commit suicide by jumping out a window at the team's headquarters in Turin this week. The official, Gianluca Pessotto, is a former national team player, but was not implicated in the scandal. He sustained multiple fractures, andseveral members of the Italian squad flew home to be with him in the past few days."

2006-06-30T00:00:00Z,"Chamber ballet companies generally last a short time. Somehow Fugate/Bahiri Ballet NY has managed not only to keep going for nine years but also to aim for an eclectic repertory that will help to develop the company's 11 dancers at the same time it engages audiences. The latest acquisition is John Butler's ''Othello,'' above, which will be performed this weekend at the Joyce Theater on a program that also includes ballets by Francis Patrelle, Thaddeus Davis, Stanton Welch and Toni Pimble. A dancer with Martha Graham before turning to ballet choreography, Mr. Butler was internationally known as one of the earliest choreographers to blend classical ballet and modern dance. He also liked to tell stories. Those were handicaps in his time, the heyday of George Balanchine and the ''abstract'' pure-dance, or plotless, ballet, and have helped to doom Mr. Butler's dances to relative obscurity since his death in 1993. Medhi Bahiri, a founder and director of the company with Judith Fugate, had long admired Mr. Butler's work but assumed it would be too costly to acquire until the John Butler Foundation approached several ballet companies, including Fugate/Bahiri. '' 'Othello' is a small, beautiful and Shakespearean, with a story which I think everybody can relate to,'' Mr. Bahiri said. The dancers, Ms. Fugate said, ''are just eating it up,'' adding that the company hoped to perform Mr. Butler's sensuous ''After Eden'' next. ''We must not let go,'' Mr. Bahiri said of the narrative ballet genre. ''It's important that a new generation of dancers should still know how to act. One of the most difficult things for dancers now is that they don't know how to stand still and act with their bodies without having to move. That's becoming lost.''

2006-06-30T00:00:00Z,"For years jazz musicians have honed their craft by combining formal and informal studies, by learning and by doing, both at once. The pianist Steve Kuhn illustrates this principle a bit more vividly than most. As a teenager in Boston in the early 1950's he came under the tutelage of the classical instructor Margaret Chaloff, and under the employment of her son Serge Chaloff, a baritone saxophonist then reliably topping Metronome magazine's reader poll. Mr. Kuhn, above, went on to build a reputation in the Boston club scene, earning a music degree from Harvard on the side. His postgraduate activities included a stint at the Lenox School of Jazz -- along with the nascent free-jazz avatars Ornette Coleman and Don Cherry -- bandstand apprenticeships with the trumpeter Kenny Dorham and, for one intense month in the spring of 1960, with the saxophonist John Coltrane. Mr. Kuhn's first recording as a bandleader, ''The October Suite,'' issued on Impulse! in 1966, featured his piano trio overlaid with a string quartet on one side of the LP. Four decades later that format, with its air of glossy refinement, still seems pertinent. Mr. Kuhn paired his piano with an orchestral string ensemble on ''Promises Kept,'' a wispy ECM release that he regards as one of his proudest achievements. Perhaps with luck he will feel just as sanguine about his next album, by a no-nonsense trio he first convened 20 years ago. The bassist is Ron Carter, the drummer is Al Foster, and Blue Note Records is recording their run at Birdland next week.

It can be amusing, and a few dishes, like the Peking duck, were terrific. But paying exorbitant prices for appetizers and main courses that don't improve significantly on cheaper analogues around town doesn't ultimately make much sense. And the servers all seem to have cash registers in their eyes. 121 Hudson Street, at North Moore Street; (212) 965-9500. Entrees, $26 to $36. Satisfactory.

2006-06-30T00:00:00Z,"MINTON - Susann. Artist, passed on Tuesday, June 27 in Manhattan after a brief illness. A Park Slope resident for 26 years, Susann was the daughter of the late Commander Hal Minton, U.S.N. and Gaynell Minton. Her early years as a Navy brat included life in the Dominican Republic and Hawaii, places that would forever feed her appetite for color, fantasy and play. Her love of the arts, especially drawing and painting, came early and remained constant. From undergraduate studies in art at the University of Georgia in Athens, GA, to receiving her M.F.A. at Pratt, art nourished her. A beautiful woman with a quick smile, Susann led her life like she painted: she was vivid, bold, funny, tough, loyal, tolerant and jaunty when in her cups. It was NYC that captured her heart, its galleries and museums feeding her passion and knowledge of the creative force. But it was Brooklyn, specifically Park Slope, that fed and nurtured her soul. It is where she met her husband, photographer Craig Blankenhorn, her true love and partner in life. Along with her husband and her mother, Susann is survived by her brother Stanley of Palm Harbor, FL, and niece Kellie and nephew Ryan. A memorial service will be held Saturday, July 1, 2006, 10:45 A.M. at Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, NY."

Ms. True, who has been accused by the Italian government of conspiring to deal in looted artifacts, went on trial in Rome in November. The Los Angeles Times reported the payment yesterday, saying that the Getty's board agreed to compensate Ms. Fleischman despite warnings from its lawyers in 2003 that covering such an expense could jeopardize the trust's nonprofit status. In a telephone interview yesterday Ms. Fleischman said she had not asked the board to pay her legal fees and that she ''was also never aware that there were any concerns or questions about any reimbursement.'' Ron Hartwig, a Getty spokesman, said yesterday that ''there was a lively debate, and the board did agree to pay those legal fees,'' and that the Getty reported the expenditure on its tax forms and alerted the California state attorney general's office of the board's decision to pay the legal fees. ''They were considered an expense in connection with Marion True's case,'' Mr. Hartwig said. Ms. Fleischman resigned from the Getty board in January after reports in The Los Angeles Times that she had made a personal loan to Ms. True.

We were never going to win that, we could still be playing now, taking penalties and that referee wouldn't have had it. Robbed, cheated, gutted.

2006-07-01T00:00:00Z,"CBS and Fox were the only two networks in the ratings game on Thursday night, since it was a race to the bottom between NBC and ABC, with UPN and WB barely visible. CBS placed first among total viewers and adults 18 to 49. It led off with the anemic ''Gameshow Marathon'' finals, during which Kathy Najimy won money for charity before an audience of 7.1 million in Nielsen's estimates. CBS's night picked up from there, with repeats of ''CSI'' (10.4 million) and ''Without a Trace'' (10.7 million) pulling up the overall ratings. Fox got a boost from the results show of ''So You Think You Can Dance'' (8 million), which drew the night's highest 18-to-49 ratings: the network finished a close second to CBS in that demographic. NBC and ABC's original offerings both tanked. At 8 p.m. ABC's ''Master of Champions'' brought in 4.9 million viewers, and at 10 p.m. NBC's ''Windfall'' attracted 4.8 million. KATE AURTHUR"

He was immediately released because he had already spent three years in detention. Prosecutors had asked for an 18-year sentence, for the looting and burning of Serb villages by the poorly trained volunteer force under his command. But the judges said the ''abysmal conditions'' of the town -- surrounded by Serbian troops and overwhelmed with refugees, many of them starving -- had led to a such breakdown of law and order that Mr. Oric, just 25 when he was appointed commander, could not be held accountable for crimes by his irregular defense force.

The match had remained tied at 1-1 through 30 minutes of overtime, as neither squad truly measured up to the importance of a confrontation between two World Cup favorites. Afterward, a 90-second scuffle broke out between the teams, bringing a sour end to the afternoon on the field.

2006-07-01T00:00:00Z,"The $52.9 billion budget approved by the New York City Council at 12:40 a.m. yesterday includes a vast pot of money for cultural institutions. The budget documents for the fiscal year that starts today, released Thursday night, suggest that cultural organizations have made out well in this budget cycle, partly because the city enjoyed a huge surplus. The Council restored $14.2 million in operating aid for 34 leading institutions, compared with $11.4 million a year earlier. In an annual ritual, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had cut that money in the full expectation that lawmakers would bring it back. The Council also added $1.9 million to the budget of the Department of Cultural Affairs for its Cultural Development Fund, which awards grants to small arts organizations. Last year the Council gave $2 million to the American Museum of Natural History, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Lincoln Center for security upgrades; this year it gave $4 million to 21 groups for security projects, including $1.3 million for the Museum of Natural History and $500,000 for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In addition, at least 263 groups received individual appropriations, up from at least 228 last year. Among the groups that appear to have fared particularly well in the new budget are the Brooklyn Arts Council, the Intrepid Museum Foundation, the Brooklyn Philharmonic (above), the Bronx Council on the Arts and American Ballet Theater. The Council also approved $800,000 to be used for programs at ''various community theaters'' throughout the city. SEWELL CHAN"

The move has created controversy within the Episcopal Church in the United States and a possible schism with the global Anglican Communion over the ordination of gay bishops and the blessings of same-sex unions. By naming a gay priest as one of the nominees to be its next leader, the Newark Diocese is testing the church's recent call to avoid backing the election of gay bishops."

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''When Saving Lives Is More Than Child's Play'' (June 25) is very impressive. As a strong advocate of the idea ''young face, good hands,'' I can appreciate the abilities of these teenage volunteer emergency workers. But I have to question the maturity of the adults who would allow a 16-year-old to be exposed to some of the extraordinarily grisly scenes that these students encounter -- drivers with missing body parts, murdered children."
2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In her review of Julia Glass's novel ''The Whole World Over'' (June 11), Lorraine Adams mentions the character Saga, who ''is afflicted with . . . a strange gift for visualizing words.'' Adams provides a few examples, like ''Godfather: Red as a ruby, bottomless vibrant purplish red, a big word, impressive but airy, the silk dragon in a Chinese parade.'' Glass has given Saga the relatively rare condition known as synesthesia, a kind of crossing of the senses that is now widely understood to have a neurological basis. As an experimental psychologist at Yale who began studying synesthesia more than 30 years ago, I was struck that Saga lives in Connecticut with her uncle, a professor at Yale. While fictional characters displaying one variety of synesthesia or another crop up sporadically -- a striking example is Jean des Esseintes, the antihero of J. K. Huysmans's ''Against the Grain,'' who hears a musical instrument in each sip of a different liqueur -- so too occasionally do writers themselves. In his autobiography, ''Speak, Memory,'' Vladimir Nabokov famously described his own synesthesia, in which various letters of the alphabet have distinctive colors. Lawrence E. Marks New Haven"

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"At first, Michael Healey's touching play ''The Drawer Boy,'' the Westport Country Playhouse's current production, seems like nothing more than a good-natured comedy about a gullible city boy being played for a fool, in a sweet way, by his country host. To do research for a new play, Miles (Carson Elrod), a fresh-faced young actor from Toronto, moves in with two middle-aged bachelor farmers in central Ontario and asks questions like ''Do the cows mind being milked continually?'' and ''How does the cow feel?'' So his host Morgan (John Bedford Lloyd) can be forgiven for sometimes giving ludicrous answers and for chuckling under his breath as he invents chores for Miles, like washing rocks individually by hand and rotating the eggs in the nests so the hens will not become emotionally attached."

Bishop, a neophyte Democrat from the Hamptons, in a vicious campaign characterized by mutual smear-slinging. Is Mr. Grucci nostalgic for Congress, or for the six rollicking years he spent as supervisor of the Town of Brookhaven? Not exactly. ''Getting yourself elected to public office has gotten to be a blood sport,'' he says. ''It's not enough to win. Today the opponent is out to destroy you, and destroy your family name, and I don't want to say it's like what the Mafia does to its enemies, but at the end of the day, it's not exactly not like what the Mafia does.''"

The city has laws restricting where cameras can be placed, said William Callion, the director of the Office of Public Safety, Health and Welfare in Stamford. Mr. Callion said he approached the city's Board of Representatives last month about passing an ordinance that would ease those laws because the city needed the cameras to increase security and to deter crime. He presented the board with different options, from limiting the cameras to areas where terrorists might strike, to placing them anywhere they might have a ''lawful purpose.''"

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"One could be forgiven for thinking the little black dress -- so safe, so flattering -- has always been with us, a staple of every woman's closet. But it was radical in its day, replacing the floating chiffons of the early 20th century, as can be seen in ''Art and Fashion: From Marie Antoinette to Jacqueline Kennedy'' at the Nassau County Museum of Art. Intelligently assembled and scrupulously presented, this is one of the best exhibitions here in a long time. It is heartening to see a museum return to form after a string of poorly arranged and presented exhibits. Much of the credit goes to the staff, but also to JoAnne Olian, costume curator emeritus at the Museum of the City of New York, who was co-curator of the exhibition with Franklin Hill Perrell, a house curator. Ms. Olian's handprints are everywhere here, from the astute, elegant integration of displays of art, fashion and furniture to a jaunty, eminently readable essay in the exhibition catalog. Museum officials were smart to draw on her expertise."

The ability of minors to drink in their homes, or in the homes of others, is an old, stubborn behavior, spawning countless teenage house parties that the police have found difficult to combat. But states and municipalities in the region have been chipping away at the problem. A Connecticut law targeting adults who allow drinking by minors was signed into law on June 2. Also last month, Rockland County and the City of Long Beach on Long Island, while taking different approaches, started work on passing laws of their own."

Deftly weaving material from the letters and journals of all three sisters, Marshall places them at the center of the 19th-century spiritual awakening known as Transcendentalism.

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"IT is a question that occurs to almost everyone who becomes seriously ill: Should you go to your local hospital or would you do better if you went to a major medical center? It may mean a long trip when you are ill and it will almost certainly mean seeing doctors who are strangers to you. But what if going to a major medical center makes the difference between life and death? Patients reach different conclusions, based often on gut feelings about a doctor or a hospital. And medical researchers, looking for data, say they are not always certain themselves about how to decide. ''There really is very, very little information,'' says Dr. Elliott S. Fisher, a professor at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, N.H., who studies medical outcomes. ''It's the great weakness of all the efforts to foster consumer engagement in health care decision making.''"

In this ''Great Performances'' special based on Garrison Keillor's public radio variety show, some of the people of Lake Wobegon celebrate Independence Day in Massachusetts. Providing the entertainment: Private Eye Guy Noir, the cowboys Dusty and Lefty, Guy's All-Star Shoe Band and, from the new Robert Altman movie that helped reinforce Mr. Keillor's nostalgic rhapsodizing as a national treasure, Meryl Streep (above, with Mr. Keillor). 3:30 P.M. (Sundance) PLACE VENDïOME -- (1998). Catherine Deneuve plays the alcoholic wife of a prominent jeweler (Bernard Fresson, who appeared alongside Ms. Deneuve in 1967 in ''Belle de Jour'') who throws out her Bordeaux to protect five exquisite diamonds he left her before he killed himself. The mood is sober, and so is the lighting in this drama from Nicole Garcia, but Ms. Deneuve sparkles. 8:30 P.M. (Nickelodeon) CHILDREN OF THE STORM -- Erica lives in a trailer on what was her front lawn but says she feels far from the life she once knew. Clive takes a tour of his old neighborhood and talks about how nothing will ever be the same.

(HGTV) INTERNATIONAL HOME AND HOUSEWARES 2006 -- Even if you don't have a remodeling budget, this special, filmed at the home-design industry's event of the year, has something for every daydreamer. 10 P.M. (BBC America) FOOTBALLERS WIVES -- Amid sagging ratings - something about not enough sports action, but that's hardly the point, now is it? - this show recently got axed in Britain. Still, it has its tasty moments, like this episode, in which the babysnatching Tanya has been sent packing, and Conrad wants to reconcile with Amber, who - their son safely back in her arms - is too busy trying to revive her Bollywood career to care. 10 P.M. (VH1) SUPERGROUP -- All good things must come to an end, and this series, in which five of metal's heaviest converged to try to build the ultimate band, is one of them.

''I was in the Battle of the Bulge, but I can't talk about it,'' he kept shouting.

There were, however, many other reminiscences. The event was my dad's 60th college reunion, and I was his date for the weekend.

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''When Saving Lives Is More Than Child's Play'' (June 25) is very impressive. As a strong advocate of the idea ''young face, good hands,'' I can appreciate the abilities of these teenage volunteer emergency workers. But I have to question the maturity of the adults who would allow a 16-year-old to be exposed to some of the extraordinarily grisly scenes that these students encounter -- drivers with missing body parts, murdered children. That is not something any 16-year-old, or even any 18-year-old, should ever have to assimilate."

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"IN May, the United States Senate passed the immigration reform bill with a last-minute rider requiring the National Park Service to reopen the Statue of Liberty's crown to visitors. On the surface, that sounds like a good idea. Why not allow tourists fuller access to perhaps the most recognized symbol of the United States? After all, the crown was open to the public for more than 100 years before being closed in reaction to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. But reopening the crown is not a good idea for a variety of reasons. And even talk of amendments proposing as much as $2 million to pay for its reopening simply doesn't make sense."
2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Tom Moore is correct in identifying the real cause of teacher shortages in New York City as failure to retain rather than failure to recruit (''Teacher Dismissed,'' Op-Ed, June 25). But the reason all those Ivy Leaguers recruited by Teach for America and New York City's Teaching Fellows program leave after only a few years is that they were never planning to build long-term careers in the system."
2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"Studying the pastry case at Bruehwiler's bakery, my eyes lock onto what appears to be my favorite French pastry: pain aux raisins, a glazed spiral of sweet, eggy yeast bread studded with raisins, with a fine layer of pastry cream woven throughout. I wonder if I might have wandered into someone else's life and awakened in a Paris boulangerie. I am, it turns out, on Main Street in Old Saybrook. And it is not a pain aux raisins; it is a hazelnut-raisin Danish. And the baker is not French; he is Swiss. But the excellence of the Danish, with its buttery multileaved dough and sweet crusty edges, goes a long way toward assuaging my disappointment."
2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I was one of the ''girls who went away,'' but my experience was different in some important ways from what was described in Kathryn Harrison's reviewof Ann Fessler's book ''The Girls Who Went Away'' (June 11). In 1955, when I was 19 and still a virgin, I became pregnant by a boy I did not love. His family lived in Sands Point, Long Island, near mine. My parents' dysfunctional marriage was coming apart; my alcoholic mother was having a breakdown, and so was I. A couple of months before that one-time sex, toward the end of my sophomore year in an exclusive women's college, I had become bulimic and anorexic, before these conditions had been widely recognized. So I did the next logical thing: I passively submitted to my ''friend's''desires. Three months later, in Geneva, where I was spending my junior year abroad, a Swiss doctor told me, ''Mademoiselle, vous avez un enfant.'' Believing from the propaganda of the time that all abortions were dangerous and not knowing what else to do, I flew home. My parents and I understood thatmy pregnancywas shameful and had to be kept secret. My father thought I had ruined my life. I thought I was bad. A psychiatrist my mother took me to (a little late) referred me to the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue'sadoption agency, Louise Wise Services. The social worker took me to their Staten Island home for unwed mothers. It turned out to be the first safe and secure environment I had ever experienced andthe beginning of the emotional healing process I so badly needed. The other girls and women in the home were the kinds of people I had never encountered in my narrow life. Some had been in reform school. Some were the victims of rape. Some were professional women. Some were creative artists. Some were just children themselves. I felt deeply for them and felt keenly the victimization of women. Most were giving their babies for adoption; some were not. They elected me president of their little self-governing association. I never put this on my résumé. Five weeks later, I gave birth to a healthy baby boy who was eligible for immediate adoption because so much was known about me and the father and it was basically all positive. From the beginning, I had not wanted to keep the baby I would bear. I had not loved the father. I did not want the social stigma. I did not want to live with a reminder all my life of such an unhappy experience. I wanted the baby to have a better home than I could possibly have provided at that point in my life. I was told he was going to be adopted by a pediatrician husband and his clinical social worker wife. I knew that I was giving them a great gift. I have never regretted my decision. I went on to get married, have two more healthy children, earn a Ph.D. and have a successful career in academe and nonprofit organization management. Ihave told few people aboutmy first child . . . until now. Dorin Oltarsh Schumacher St. Simons Island, Ga."

As he was signing a set of letters last week to transfer $37.4 billion of his fortune to five different charities, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Mr. Buffett deadpanned: ''I wanted to make sure I didn't ever send one that started, 'Dear Anna Nicole Smith.'

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"KOCH--Robert Newman Jr. 79, an executive in the fashion jewelry business and beloved husband of Elaine Koch, died Friday, at his East Orleans, Mass., home, of complications of Parkinson's disease. Mr. Koch was president of Coro, Inc., the nation's largest costume jewelry maker, before he founded R.N. Koch, Inc., in 1971, with offices in New York and a factory in Providence, RI. Mr. Koch, who also had homes in New York and Long Boat Key, FL, was born in Buffalo, NY, on September 26, 1926. He later relocated with his parents to New York City. He served in the navy as a radio operator in the Pacific during World War II. After attending Nichols Junior College in Dudley, Mass., he joined Coro and eventually worked his way up to president of the company. ''He loved everything about the jewelry business,'' said his daughter Peggy Palmer. His personality and artistic gifts made him perfectly suited for it. He loved the arts, particularly music and painting, and often shopped at New York and Florida galleries. Mr. Koch was formerly married to Susan Dryfoos and the couple had two daughters. In 1995, he married Elaine Stone on the lawn of his Cape Cod home, and the couple enjoyed traveling, dining and entertaining. His family treasured Bob's love of life, whether it was food, the arts, being with friends and family, or traveling. They will always treasure his goodness of heart. In addition to his wife Elaine and his daughters Peggy Palmer and Katharine Willens, both of California, he is survived by sons-in-law Briggs Palmer and Randall Willens, grandchildren Jordan and Christopher Palmer, and Charlotte and Daniel Willens, his stepdaughters Susan Van Sicklen and Debra Nussbaum, stepsons-in-law Michael Van Sicklen and Paul Nussbaum, and step - grandchildren Barret, Nick and David Van Sicklen, Zachary and Gerry Bissinger, Molly and Mathew Nussbaum, and his devoted caregiver Raymond Bradley. Private graveside service will be held Thursday. A memorial service is being planned for the fall. Donations may be made to the Robert N. Koch Jr. Foundation, established by Mr. Koch to aid Parkinson's Research, in care of Mr. Todd Lang, Esq., Weil Gotshal Manges, 767 5th Ave., New York, NY 10153. $(6$)KOCH--Robert N.

How strange. Does arguing rationally (and convincingly) that something went wrong in Ohio make you a daredevil?

After seeking refuge in France with his parents in 1939, he and his mother were ultimately deported in 1942 to Auschwitz, where his mother perished. In May 1945, he was reunited with his father and his brother, Fred, then serving in the U.S. Army in France. He met his wife, Fanny, in Paris in 1948, and then immigrated to the U.S. After earning his Bachelor of Business Administration degree at CCNY (Baruch College) in 1958, he established a distinguished CPA practice and specialized in motion picture accounting/auditing and entertainment business management. Throughout his life, he was active in Holocaust education: founding and serving as President of the American Friends of the Anne Frank Center and of the French Children of the Holocaust Foundation; producing traveling exhibits on Anne Frank, anti-Semitism and the history of the French children of the Holocaust. Most recently, he was instrumental in the creation of ''Letters to Sala,'' an exhibit at the New York Public Library, an ongoing project organized by Ann Kirschner.

He has also taped countless Common Council meetings, registering the debates that preceded each step of the development for a documentary he plans to show on local cable TV. But some residents started to complain to City Hall about being filmed during the meetings, and Mayor Joseph M. Delfino began to question Mr. Albanese's intentions, said Paul Wood, the city's executive officer, who said he was speaking for Mr. Delfino. The mayor asked city lawyers if there was a way to control Mr. Albanese, and the lawyers found a 63-year-old ordinance limiting anyone from recording council meetings without advance consent."

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"ED HULIT of Point Pleasant usually grills hot dogs outdoors but serves them indoors. He would prefer to have a regular barbecue, as he did last Fourth of July weekend, when the emergency aid siren 40 yards behind his Hiawatha Avenue home was out of operation. But Mr. Hulit, one of a group of residents who say the three sirens in the borough blare too loudly and too often, says that when that siren is working, he finds himself wondering, ''Is it going to go off?''"
2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"DANIELI--Francesa. Mother, sister, daughter, friend, wife, and artist...we all lost a beautiful woman on the the evening of June 27. Francesca has shown remarkable grace, strength & dignity, having first faced cancer 22 years ago when diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma; then with breast cancer eight years ago; followed by metastatic disease diagnosed nearly two years ago. Having lived her life with such grace, dignity and wit, Francesca spent her last weeks in character at a hospice and wanted all of her friends and family to know that she believes that she led a very fortunate life. Having received national recognition for her work as a photographer and videographer, Francesca has published her body of work in Gamma Knife by Nazraeli Press in 2005. Her video project ''One Nice Thing'' was an official selection at 3 film festivals. Her work is held in the collections of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX and the Getty Museum. Francesca completed Masters Degrees at both the Columbia Business School and the Maryland Institute College of Art and received her BFA from the Virginia Commonwealth University. Francesca is survived by her three daughters, Anna, Lee and Isabel Gensler; her husband, Gary Gensler, all of Brooklandville, MD; her father, Francesco Costagliola of Alexandria, VA; and her three sisters, Marisa Costagliola of Columbia, MD, Antonia Burns of Cambridge, MD, and Rose Rubin of Falls Church, VA.

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: The author of ''Space Empties, and Time Rushes In'' (June 25) revels in her last child having left the ''nest'' for college. She complains about the ''ridiculously high suburban New York property taxes,'' but at the same time enjoys being ''deliciously self-indulgent'' by continuing to live in a house meant for four. Her ''deep roots'' in the community have convinced her to stay put."

We mourn the passing of our good friend, Samuel Gruber, a heroic underground fighter during the Holocaust, a leading partisan commander who kept the torch of Jewish resistance in the struggle against the Nazi enemy, and in the effort in saving Jewish lives. He wrote the book ''I Chose Life''. Let his memory remain as a blessing for all who knew and loved him, and will miss him. Our most heartfelt sympathy to the entire bereaved family.

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"IT was the prom with strings attached. After some cases of student drinking at a Garden City High School dance in December, the principal, Hank Hardy, canceled two other dances on the calendar. That led many parents and seniors to fear that the prom itself would become a victim. After all, Kellenberg Memorial in Uniondale and Chaminade in Mineola had canceled their proms."
2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"KNEELING on a narrow river beach, the four biologists picked deftly through a wriggling, shimmering mound of small fish they had just seined up from the Delaware, and tossed them into small plastic containers to await counting and measuring: white perch, Atlantic croakers, bluefish, silversides, menhaden. Only one variety escaped the rough steerage treatment, the three fish with racing stripes along their flanks and a tinge of dollar-bill green along their backs. They were permitted to swim regally in the first-class temporary accommodations of a brimming five-gallon bucket. ''They're what we're here for, so we try to put them in water right away,'' said Jen Pyle, a fisheries technician for New Jersey's Division of Fish and Wildlife, referring to the three native striped bass that were in the first haul of the season's first sampling trip. The twin suspension spans of the Delaware Memorial Bridge loomed in the distance behind her, and the morning sun glinted off the silty blue river."
2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: We read with interest your story on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his crusade to draw attention to fraud in the 2004 election in Ohio, having covered that issue in our own pages almost one year ago. We like to think that the ''low-grade rumblings about alleged abuses'' Mr. Kennedy had heard before being fully converted by Mark Crispin Miller's book were, in fact, the cover story of the August 2005 issue of Harper's Magazine, ''None Dare Call It Stolen,'' an article by Mr. Miller that preceded the publication of his book by four months.

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"The august JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL in the Berkshires is as beloved for its vivid history and lush green setting as for the eclecticism of its programming, which this week includes modern dance from Israel, performed by EMANUEL GAT DANCE and set to Schubert and Stravinsky, and SUZANNE FARRELL and her ensemble. Ms. Farrell has an eye for unaffected dancers who deliver Balanchine's ballets straight up, here including ''Divertimento No. 15'' and the pas de deux from the rarely seen ''Clarinade.'' Free events include a chat with JOHN ANTHONY GILVEY about his new book, ''Before the Parade Passes By: Gower Champion and the Glorious American Musical,'' which he will sign on Wednesday beginning at 5 p.m., and a discussion on Saturday at 4 p.m. with Ms. Farrell about her Balanchine lineage. Emanuel Gat Dance, Thursday through Sunday, $24, $21.60, students and 65+; Suzanne Farrell Ballet, Wednesday through Sunday, $50, $45, students and 65+; Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass.

The AMERICAN BALLET THEATER production of Frederick Ashton's ''SYLVIA,'' a surprise hit last summer, is back at the Metropolitan Opera House for four performances, and it's about time. The ballet is crammed with gods, goddesses, nymphs and shepherds, who skulk and cavort through a complicated plot. But that narrative is set to the most delicious of scores, by Delibes, and it is full of dance that is inventive and tenderly lyrical, just the effervescent treat for hot summer nights. Monday through Thursday at 8 p.m. and Wednesday at 2 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000 or abt.org; $23 to $163.

The program by Mr. Battle, known for his high-energy yet witty modern choreography, includes a world premiere to music by Philip Hamilton. Paradigm will perform new works by Carmen de Lavallade, Wally Cardona, Larry Keigwin, Kay Cummings and Mr. Solomons.

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''Bigger, but Not Better,'' by Richard Amper and Richard Johannesen (Op-Ed, June 25), is sadly more than true. I've never understood why most local legislators are indeed more responsive to ''developers than to the public.'' While we're the ones who vote, the developers often don't even live in their districts."
2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"IF the Edith Ort Thomas Elementary School holds its ''Frenchtown Idol'' show again next school year, 9-year-old Olivia Turton hopes to sing ''Awesome God.'' On Monday in Trenton, Judge Stanley R. Chesler of Federal District Court will take up a lawsuit over her right to do so. Olivia was not allowed to sing the song in May 2005, when she was in second grade; school officials said it amounted to Christian proselytizing."
2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"While Mr. Buffett was willing to give away that kind of wisdom last week, more serious and in-depth advice from the man known as the Oracle of Omaha comes at a much steeper price. As he does every year, Mr. Buffett is willing to have lunch with the highest bidder at an auction to benefit the Glide Foundation, a charity for the homeless in San Francisco for which his late wife, Susan, had volunteered."
2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"IN four years, Carl Albanese, a 55-year-old freelance video producer, has amassed 50 hours of video recordings showcasing the reinvention of White Plains, from the demolition of vacant buildings to the construction of office and condo towers that dot its downtown. He has also taped countless Common Council meetings, registering the debates that preceded each step of the development for a documentary he plans to show on local cable TV. But some residents started to complain to City Hall about being filmed during the meetings, and Mayor Joseph M. Delfino began to question Mr. Albanese's intentions, said Paul Wood, the city's executive officer, who said he was speaking for Mr. Delfino.

The proposal addresses security concerns, environmental issues, and safety and operations, as well as the future use of an 18.8-acre former Air National Guard site on the airport's property. Security improvements proposed by the county include the installation of vehicle checkpoints that could be activated during heightened alerts, creating a permanent baggage screening area and provisions for curbside baggage checking."

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"CITIES and states have long fought under-age drinking, easily passing laws that make it illegal in public, but not so easily passing and enforcing laws that make it illegal on private property. The ability of minors to drink in their homes, or in the homes of others, is an old, stubborn behavior, spawning countless teenage house parties that the police have found difficult to combat. But states and municipalities in the region have been chipping away at the problem. A Connecticut law targeting adults who allow drinking by minors was signed into law on June 2. Also last month, Rockland County and the City of Long Beach on Long Island, while taking different approaches, started work on passing laws of their own."

Along the way I did a sky dive in Namibia that had my mom in fits. She thought that after the sky diving, it was all finished, so I did one more thing to wind her up. Bungee jumping was just like flying, really. Or being about to plummet to your death. My mom and I had an agreement: I couldn't tell her what I was doing until I'd done it. Afterward, I texted her, 'Ooooh, about to do a bungee jump,' left a couple of minutes for her to worry, and then sent a text that said I had done it. She was just relieved I was in one piece. I had a bit of a headache, but that was cured by a beer.'' As told to Seth Kugel"
2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"IN May, the United States Senate passed the immigration reform bill with a last-minute rider requiring the National Park Service to reopen the Statue of Liberty's crown to visitors. On the surface, that sounds like a good idea. Why not allow tourists fuller access to perhaps the most recognized symbol of the United States? After all, the crown was open to the public for more than 100 years before being closed in reaction to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. But reopening the crown is not a good idea for a variety of reasons. And even talk of amendments proposing as much as $2 million to pay for its reopening simply doesn't make sense."

She was born February 15, 1927, in Detroit, MI, and married John H. Beard in 1949. Mrs. Beard earned a BA in English literature and an MS in special education from Wayne State University in Detroit. Additional postgraduate work was done at Teachers College at Columbia University.

Mrs. Beard closed out her career in the Member Education Unit at Fountain House in New York, where her husband, the late John H.

The Board of Education chose Mr. Organisciak on June 1 after a six-month search to find someone to replace Linda Kelly, who is retiring after 16 years as superintendent and 40 years in the New Rochelle school system. The district hired School Leadership, an educational search company in Port Jefferson, to consult on the hiring process. The firm held a public forum to find out what qualities parents wanted in the new superintendent and also received feedback from the teachers union, administrators, school staff and the leaders of the PTA. Six candidates were invited for interviews."

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"''This biennial will have fewer than 40 artists in it'' has become the curatorial equivalent of ''The check is in the mail.'' But ''STILL POINTS OF A TURNING WORLD,'' the international biennial opening next Sunday at Site Santa Fe in New Mexico, could be the exception. KLAUS OTTMANN, the independent curator and critic who organized this latest incarnation -- the sixth -- has tackled head-on the chronic mega-biennial blights of self-obliterating sprawl and play-it-safe predictability. Not only do most biennials usually represent 50 to 100 artists, they also tend to concentrate on pretty much the same 50 to 100. You can rarely locate a curatorial viewpoint, and by the time you've waded through the show, you're usually too exhausted to care. Mr. Ottmann opted for radical reduction: his biennial has a mere 13 artists and, what's more, most of them are not among the usual suspects. They're from different continents, work in different mediums and range tremendously in age and prominence. Some, like the installation artist WOLFGANG LAIB, are former biennial regulars who haven't been so visible lately. Others, like the Conceptual painter JENNIFER BARTLETT and the post-Minimalist sculptor ROBERT GROSVENOR, are veterans of the American scene who have never been part of the circuit. Several are younger artists on their way up, like the performance-video artist PATTY CHANG, the painting-installation artist WANGECHI MUTU, the painter-videoist STEPHEN DEAN and a three-year-old Norwegian collective called THORNS LTD. Even the best known on the list have not attained white-hot art stardom: MIROSLAW BALKA, PETER DOIG, CRISTINA IGLESIAS, JONATHAN MEESE, CARSTEN NICOLAI and CATHERINE OPIE. Each artist will have plenty of space in Site Santa Fe's cavernous shedlike building. Such art-friendliness could also yield viewer-friendliness. Some people worry that Mr. Ottmann may have gone overboard and that his show actually has too few artists. Even if they are right, he should be commended for having the courage to think bold by simply thinking small. July 9 through Jan. 7, 1606 Paseo de Peralta, Santa Fe, N.M., sitesantafe.org."

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"The longest losing streak of the Mets' season had something to do with their opponents. On consecutive days, they lost to Josh Beckett and Curt Schilling and got one hit against Mike Mussina and his relievers. The specter of Randy Johnson loomed next. Johnson, the Yankees' left-hander, can still inspire fear. He has accomplished more than all the pitchers who contributed to the Mets' four-game losing streak. But as he nears his 43rd birthday, he is not consistently dominant anymore."

This time of year, though, it is a subspecialty that has first-time customers wandering back to the three-year-old parlorlike bar for refills. Two dozen flavors of full-bodied gelato -- everything from carapino (caramel with pignoli nuts) to mi amore (strawberry chocolate chip) -- are firm enough to stand up to a crispy waffle cone edged in chocolate, but are just as satisfying scooped into a single-serving cup ($2.80) and savored in small bites."

He has also taped countless Common Council meetings, registering the debates that preceded each step of the development for a documentary he plans to show on local cable TV. But some residents started to complain to City Hall about being filmed during the meetings, and Mayor Joseph M.

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"IT is a question that occurs to almost everyone who becomes seriously ill: Should you go to your local hospital or would you do better if you went to a major medical center? It may mean a long trip when you are ill and it will almost certainly mean seeing doctors who are strangers to you. But what if going to a major medical center makes the difference between life and death? Patients reach different conclusions, based often on gut feelings about a doctor or a hospital. And medical researchers, looking for data, say they are not always certain themselves about how to decide. ''There really is very, very little information,'' says Dr. Elliott S. Fisher, a professor at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, N.H., who studies medical outcomes. ''It's the great weakness of all the efforts to foster consumer engagement in health care decision making.''"

They are part of ''Searching for Shakespeare,'' a captivating look at this famous and elusive man of letters. Organized by the National Portrait Gallery in London, where it debuted to rave reviews in March, the show sensibly avoids theories about who wrote Shakespeare's plays and concentrates on how Shakespeare lived his life. Many biographical details have been lost, but we do know that Shakespeare, born in 1564, was the eldest son of a glove maker from Stratford-Upon-Avon, grew up in a prosperous household, attended the local school and, at 18, sought a special dispensation from the Anglican Church to marry Anne Hathaway, 26 and pregnant."

A native of Lake Forest, IL, she was the daughter of the late James R. Addington and Sarah Wood Armour, who survives her, as does her brother Whitney W. Addington, MD. Her brother Keene H. Addington predeceased her. Her beloved grandparents were General and Mrs. Robert E. Wood. General Wood was Chief Quartermaster during the building of the Panama Canal, later becoming President and Chairman of Sears Roebuck & Co. For a woman who never married nor had children, Dr. Addington had a huge family. She has eleven nieces and nephews and fifteen godchildren, and all their children consider Anne a grandparent. Anne attended Ethel Walker School and Smith College, graduating with a BA in Economics in 1959, and then earned her Ph.D. in Psychology from NYU. She served her patients, primarily children, with empathy and wisdom throughout her life. Anne loved sports, competing ferociously in squash, tennis and golf. She attended four Summer and two Winter Olympiads, but nothing thrilled her more than tennis. She attended each of the four Grand Slams and was a season ticket holder at the US Open. Despite deteriorating health, Anne remained a fixture at the US Open, able to walk and talk her way into any match or front row seat. Music was another passion of Anne's, especially opera. She was a Wagner enthusiast who experienced The Ring Cycle in numerous venues including Bayreuth. Anne studied opera for many years with conductor Robert Bass and frequently invited friends to join her Saturday afternoon excursions to The Met. Anne was a true original, a lover of life with a keen intellect and quick wit. Her homes were full of light, art, books and various pets, primarily large, undisciplined dogs. She approached the world with absolute openness, abundant curiosity and a deep compassion and respect for each of its citizens. Her numerous and varied friends, of all ages and walks of life, will never forget her. A memorial service is planned for Sept. 30th at the NY Historical Society. In lieu of flowers, donations to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at 733 Third Avenue, NY, NY 10017 are deeply appreciated."

He has also taped countless Common Council meetings, registering the debates that preceded each step of the development for a documentary he plans to show on local cable TV. But some residents started to complain to City Hall about being filmed during the meetings, and Mayor Joseph M. Delfino began to question Mr. Albanese's intentions, said Paul Wood, the city's executive officer, who said he was speaking for Mr. Delfino. The mayor asked city lawyers if there was a way to control Mr. Albanese, and the lawyers found a 63-year-old ordinance limiting anyone from recording council meetings without advance consent."

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"The public has good reason to be wary of the motives of Steve Parrish and the tobacco industry (Joe Nocera, June 18). Even as tobacco companies claim to be fighting the battle against youth smoking, their methods ooze with reverse psychology. By warning adolescents not to smoke until they are older, cigarette corporations are in effect telling young people that smoking is an exclusively adult activity, off limits to children. I'm sure that message isn't intended to tempt teenagers, already craving to assert their independence, into lighting up. Jason Liebowitz Rockville, Md. If a cigarette manufacturer acknowledges the harm of its product, stops targeting the teenage demographic and spends money trying to help people to quit, is it fair to blame the company? There's nothing wrong with being suspicious of Altria's and Steve Parrish's motives, but at least this devil that we do know is trying, as opposed to those reckless new companies that would leap at the chance to usurp Philip Morris USA. A.C. Riccio New York Steve Parrish is probably correct when he says that ''if Philip Morris USA were to shut down tomorrow, it would not reduce the consumption of cigarettes at all.'' It's also correct that young kids can purchase dangerous narcotics on the street, whether I sell them to them or not. Still, I'm not going to do it. Robert Carlton Upland, Calif."

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"WHEN it comes to garage sales, everyone has a strategy. Shop early for selection. Shop late for bargains. Bring a list or let serendipity prevail. I'm from the undisciplined serendipity school, which means I have wasted a lot of money over the years. I once bought a huge wooden toboggan, only to find that it turned up regularly on the local garage sale circuit. Buyers would ride it downhill once, realize they could not pull it back uphill and sell it the next summer. We did the same. But the garage-sale fates have also bestowed upon me some of my favorite possessions: a footstool with bull's-eye trim, a stately pair of salt-and-pepper shakers, an eerie print of a century-old indoor swimming pool. None of them are treasures of an ''Antiques Roadshow'' sort; all of them make me smile."
2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"IT is a question that occurs to almost everyone who becomes seriously ill: Should you go to your local hospital or would you do better if you went to a major medical center? It may mean a long trip when you are ill and it will almost certainly mean seeing doctors who are strangers to you. But what if going to a major medical center makes the difference between life and death? Patients reach different conclusions, based often on gut feelings about a doctor or a hospital. And medical researchers, looking for data, say they are not always certain themselves about how to decide. ''There really is very, very little information,'' says Dr. Elliott S.

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"''HEADING SOUTH,'' the third film by the French director LAURENT CANTET, pushes as many buttons -- political, racial and sexual -- as a movie could hope without straining to be all things to all people. The film, which opens on Friday in New York, was the strongest entry in this year's Rendez-Vous With French Cinema series at Lincoln Center. Earlier it was shown at the Toronto Film Festival, where critics, nervous about its subject matter, greeted it with guarded approval. CHARLOTTE RAMPLING, in one of her most fearless performances, plays a 55-year-old college teacher of French literature taking her annual vacation at an out-of-the-way Haitian resort in the late 1970's. She is the queen bee among a gaggle of unattached middle-aged women from Europe and North America who flock there to enjoy the sexual company of handsome, impoverished black beach boys. The visitors lavish gifts and cash on them in exchange for love. Without judgment, the film, adapted from three stories by DANY LAFERRIÈRE, explores the intersections of cultural imperialism, sexual tourism and women's liberation in a repressive dictatorship. Much as the proud Haitian hotel workers loathe the rich visitors who exploit them, they desperately welcome their needed dollars. These relationships may be commercial, but they are also tender. Weighing the value of erotic pleasure and the emotional risks involved in its pursuit, the women address questions of sex, love, aging, loneliness and desire in blunt personal monologues. The movie is a powerful reminder that indeed the personal is political.

For those who find that remark inscrutably concise, a sign in the Barnum Museum here explains: ''He knew that the public enjoyed being fooled provided they were also educated and entertained at the same time.'' Well, the people of Bridgeport have certainly been educated and entertained in recent years -- all while being fooled. Just three years ago, the mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, was sent to prison for nine years for taking kickbacks of $500,000 in cash, meals and Oriental rugs. Contractors would park on the roof of the City Hall Annex and scramble down a private staircase into the mayor's opulent office, without his secretary even noticing, just to be shaken down."

Let me warn your readers not to take Bloom's advice.

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"Maybe it's not as big a shock for music fans as the day Bob Dylan went electric at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, but Bruce Springsteen going folkie is certainly unexpected. In ''BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN -- THE SEEGER SESSIONS LIVE,'' a ''Great Performances'' special on PBS stations Wednesday night (check local listings), Mr. Springsteen pays tribute to PETE SEEGER, 87, with a program of songs Mr. Seeger made popular, including ''John Henry,'' ''Jacob's Ladder'' and the civil rights anthem ''We Shall Overcome.'' It's basically an hourlong plug for his new album and tour, but we'll take Springsteen any way we can get him. STEVE BRIDGES, the Bush impersonator, was a hit working side by side with the president at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner in April. He'll perform for the first family again on ABC's holiday gala ''AN AMERICAN CELEBRATION AT FORD'S THEATER: THE JULY 4TH SPECIAL'' (Tuesday night at 10). Heaven knows shows like these need laughs, so it's good to learn that in addition to the musical acts (including HEATHER HEADLEY and the country group LONESTAR), KEVIN NEALON will perform, and that TOM SELLECK, who can be funny under the right circumstances, is the host. NBC's special ''MACY'S 4TH OF JULY FIREWORKS SPECTACULAR'' is conveniently scheduled for 9 p.m., so viewers can watch both. The new version of ''Doctor Who,'' the British adventure series about a time traveler who faces aliens and other annoyances, had its premiere on the Sci Fi Channel in March. And on Tuesday ''DOCTOR WHO -- THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON'' will be released on DVD. The stars are CHRISTOPHER ECCLESTON (he did only one season before his character regenerated into DAVID TENNANT) and BILLIE PIPER (who is leaving the series after the second season).

Behind the News -- Mr. Buffett, 75, had said in the past that he wouldn't give away his money until after his death, but apparently his close relationship with Mr. Gates made him change his mind. The donation, which will amount to about $31 billion, doubles the size of the Gates organization, making it by far the largest grant-making foundation in the United States. Experts in philanthropy said that what made Mr. Buffett's decision even more remarkable was the apparent lack of ego involved: most people who donate an enormous sum of money would create an institution in their own name. IN DIPLOMACY The News -- Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan and President Bush presented a united front against North Korea. Behind the News -- After talks with Mr. Bush at the White House, Mr. Koizumi said Japan would ''apply various pressures'' on North Korea if that country tested a long-range missile. But the security discussions were far from the highlight of the two-day visit by the Japanese leader, one of Mr. Bush's closest foreign partners. The president took Mr. Koizumi, a huge Elvis fan, to Memphis for a visit to Graceland, treating everyone to fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches, the King's favorite, on the way. Mr. Koizumi paid tribute to his hero by singing ''Love Me Tender'' in the Jungle Room. IN DEATH The News -- Nathaniel Hawthorne was reunited with his wife, Sophia, at a cemetery in Concord, Mass., after nearly a century and a half. Behind the News -- The author was buried in the cemetery in 1864, but Sophia, by all accounts one of his major sources of inspiration, was buried seven years later in London, where she had resettled. A Roman Catholic order of nuns founded by Hawthorne's daughter Rose financed the reinterment of Sophia and another daughter, Una, by saving $15,000 out of living expenses. The nuns, based in Hawthorne, N.Y., care for terminally ill cancer patients. ''Taking care of the deceased is an act of mercy,'' one of them said, ''and it's an act of our faith.'' IN THEATERS The News -- Superman and Lois Lane were together again in ''Superman Returns.''

As for the Man of Steel (played by Brandon Routh) and Lois (Kate Bosworth), their on-again, off-again romance of previous films is now mostly off.

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"From 1929 until his death in 1972, Joseph Cornell spent much of his time at home in Queens, caring for his sick mother and invalid brother. He had no life to speak of, no friends and very little in the way of physical relationships. What he did have was his art, box assemblages made at night in the basement. The thrust of his life is in these artworks, almost 50 of which are on display at the Katonah Museum of Art in an intimate, elegantly installed exhibition put together by Therese Lichtenstein, an independent curator."

2006-07-02T00:00:00Z,"When JOSÉ RIVERA first imagined himself into the mind of Che Guevara for the 2004 film ''The Motorcycle Diaries,'' Guevara was a 23-year-old medical student named Ernesto heading off on a 7,500-mile trek with a friend to see South America and pick up girls. Mr. Rivera finished writing the movie, but he wasn't finished with his subject. He was intrigued enough to write a play about the famed revolutionary, not at a time of fresh-faced enthusiasm but on the night before his execution in Bolivia in 1967, after the failure of his guerrilla campaign. ''SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS,'' now in previews, is based on Guevara's encounter with a village schoolteacher who wangled her way into the tiny schoolhouse where he was kept before his death. Mr. Rivera found out about the episode while doing research for the movie. Guevara was a prolific writer, so if you're interested in going to the source, consider reading ''THE BOLIVIAN DIARY,'' compiled from notebooks found in his knapsack after his death, or ''THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES: NOTES ON A LATIN AMERICAN JOURNEY,'' his own account of his youthful excursion. For an outsider's look at his life, try Jon Lee Anderson's 1997 biography, ''CHE GUEVARA: A REVOLUTIONARY LIFE.'' Or to see how another artist mixes fact and fantasy, get Jay Cantor's beautiful first novel, ''THE DEATH OF CHE GUEVARA.'' Sartre once called Che ''part of the great myths of this century -- our era's most perfect man.'' And now Mr. Rivera has contributed to the myth-making myth by imagining not only a beginning in Che's brief life, but also an end.

Born in Central Europe and educated at French boarding schools, she traveled widely after World War II, which provided her the opportunity to collect works of art and antiques from various parts of the world.

She was a member of the Foreign Policy Association and was involved in local and national political affairs. An extraordinary woman, a captivating hostess and a friend and confident of many, she is survived by her son, Paul, a surgeon, of Tenafly, NJ; her daughter, Ruth Silberstein and husband Ronald Silberstein, of Newton Centre, MA; six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

Mr. Koch was president of Coro, Inc., the nation's largest costume jewelry maker, before he founded R.N. Koch, Inc., in 1971, with offices in New York and a factory in Providence, RI. Mr. Koch, who also had homes in New York and Long Boat Key, FL, was born in Buffalo, NY, on September 26, 1926. He later relocated with his parents to New York City. He served in the navy as a radio operator in the Pacific during World War II. After attending Nichols Junior College in Dudley, Mass., he joined Coro and eventually worked his way up to president of the company. ''He loved everything about the jewelry business,'' said his daughter Peggy Palmer. His personality and artistic gifts made him perfectly suited for it. He loved the arts, particularly music and painting, and often shopped at New York and Florida galleries. Mr. Koch was formerly married to Susan Dryfoos and the couple had two daughters. In 1995, he married Elaine Stone on the lawn of his Cape Cod home, and the couple enjoyed traveling, dining and entertaining. His family treasured Bob's love of life, whether it was food, the arts, being with friends and family, or traveling. They will always treasure his goodness of heart. In addition to his wife Elaine and his daughters Peggy Palmer and Katharine Willens, both of California, he is survived by sons-in-law Briggs Palmer and Randall Willens, grandchildren Jordan and Christopher Palmer, and Charlotte and Daniel Willens, his stepdaughters Susan Van Sicklen and Debra Nussbaum, stepsons-in-law Michael Van Sicklen and Paul Nussbaum, and step - grandchildren Barret, Nick and David Van Sicklen, Zachary and Gerry Bissinger, Molly and Mathew Nussbaum, and his devoted caregiver Raymond Bradley.

2006-07-04T00:00:00Z,"Jere Longman breaks down a few matchups in today's semifinal match between Germany and Italy. Fabio Cannavaro and Marco Materazzi ITALY'S CENTRAL DEFENDERS VS. Miroslav Klose GERMAN FORWARD Cannavaro and Alessandro Nesta have long been considered perhaps the best pair of central defenders in the world. But Nesta is out with a groin injury. Materazzi returns against Germany after a one-game suspension. Cannavaro and Materazzi will have to contend with Klose, who leads the World Cup with five goals. He is a target player -- dangerous on headers and superb at receiving and controlling the ball in the penalty area. It was Klose's header that tied the score of the quarterfinal against Argentina, forcing overtime in a game Germany won in a penalty-kick shootout. Tim Borowski or Sebastian Kehl GERMANY'S DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDERS VS. Francesco Totti ITALY'S PLAYMAKER Germany suffered a blow yesterday when its starting defensive midfielder, Torsten Frings, was suspended for the semifinals after television replays showed he threw a punch at the Argentine forward Julio Cruz after their quarterfinal match. Frings did a celebrated job of smothering Argentina's playmaker, Juan Riquelme, in that game. He will be replaced by Borowski, who prefers to come forward in attack, or by Kehl, a creative but more defensive-minded midfielder. Totti is returning to form after having surgery in February to repair ligament damage and a broken bone in his left leg. He prefers to play in a recessed position behind Italy's forwards, whether it be Luca Toni as a lone striker, or Toni paired with Alberto Gilardino. Italy VS. Germany's So-Called 12th Man THE LARGE, LOUD CROWD AT WESTFALENSTADION IN DORTMUND The stadium seats 65,000 for the tournament and features steeply banked rows of seats that hold in the sound. The stadium is home to Borussia Dortmund of the Bundesliga. The German national team has never lost in Dortmund, having won 13 games and tied one. Germany's last appearance in Dortmund was a 4-1 thrashing of the United States in an exhibition on March 22."

Born July 8, 1925, to Lillian and Harry Sacks, in Newark, NJ, Leonard devoted his life to uplifting humankind. As a clinical psychologist in private practice for more than 50 years, he was a trusted counselor and confidant; as a professor at Seton Hall University and The City University of New York, he developed pioneering programs for children with special needs. Leonard was the consummate New Yorker. He lived in The Apthorp on Manhattan's Upper West Side with the late Shirley Kamell Sacks, his wife and best friend of 43 years; in her honor Leonard endowed academic and music scholarships at Teachers College and Barnard College. With values rooted in faith and fellowship, Leonard and Shirley travelled the world together. And they cherished their three children: Leo, a record producer, lyricist and journalist; Joanne, an educational psychologist; and David, a television writer and producer. Leonard leaves a brother, Myron, and a sister, Betty; a son-in-law, David Salomon; two daughters-in-law, Judy Sacks and Bo Corre; and eight beloved grandchildren. Summing up his life's philosophy, he said, simply: ''I tried to be a mensch.'' A memorial service is planned. $(6$)SACKS--Leonard.

ALLIANCE France is ''extremely cautious'' about the prospect of General Motors forming an alliance with Renault and Nissan, the French industry minister said yesterday. ''This shouldn't be taken as a done deal; it's an idea,'' François Loos, the minister, below, said in an interview with i-Tele television. Mr. Loos was speaking after the boards of Renault and Nissan on Monday authorized Carlos Ghosn, who is chief executive of both carmakers, to begin negotiations with G.M. if its board agrees. The French state holds about 15 percent of Renault. A alliance among Renault, Nissan and G.M. would nevertheless be ''positive'' in principle, Mr. Loos added. (AP) G.M.'S SALES IN CHINA SOAR General Motors said yesterday that its sales in China jumped 47 percent over a year earlier in the first six months of this year, helped by stronger-than-expected demand. G.M. and its joint ventures sold 453,832 vehicles in China in the January to June period, compared with 308,722 in the same period of 2005, the company said in a statement. G.M. says it had a 12.5 percent share in the China vehicle market, up from 10.8 percent a year earlier, making it the No. 1 foreign automaker in the country. Last year, it surpassed the longtime leader, Volkswagen of Germany. On Monday, G.M. reported a 26 percent decline in its United States sales for June over the previous year.

(AP) RUSSIA WARNED ON ENERGY The ratings agency Standard & Poor's warned Russia yesterday of the dangers of basing its economy on the energy industry, urging policy makers to avoid ''the pitfalls of hydrocarbon dependence.'' The company said in a report that an influx of foreign currency from the sale of Russian gas and oil could force up the value of the ruble, which could harm other industrial sectors. The report said that receipts from oil and gas provided Russia with about 50 percent of its government revenues, and 65 percent of export earnings.

The launchings came in defiance of warnings from President Bush and the governments of Japan, South Korea and China. A1 Deaths of Iraqis Still on Rise Baghdad's central morgue said it had received 1,595 bodies in June, 16 percent more than in May, in a tally that showed the pace of the killing in Baghdad has increased since the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Iraq's most wanted insurgent leader. A10 The military investigation into soldiers suspected of raping an Iraqi woman and killing her and her family is looking at whether poor oversight within the soldiers' unit helped give them the chance to operate on their own, American military officials said. A11 American commanders say they are planning to bulldoze about three blocks in the middle of Ramadi, the epicenter of the Iraqi insurgency, and convert them into a ''Green Zone,'' a version of the fortified and largely stable area that houses the Iraqi and American leadership in Baghdad. A1 Electoral Crisis Builds in Mexico Mexico's electoral crisis deepened as the leftist candidate demanded a recount and election officials acknowledged that as many as three million votes had not been tallied in the preliminary results.

A3 NATIONAL A12-14 Bush Signals a Shift On Immigration Approach In an attempt to revise his stalled immigration bill before Election Day, President Bush is demonstrating a new willingness to negotiate with House Republicans, showing interest in a so-called enforcement-first approach that would put new border security programs in place before creating a guest worker program or a path to citizenship for illegal aliens. A1 Speaking to hundreds of soldiers and their families at Fort Bragg, President Bush warned that setting an ''artificial timetable'' for a withdrawal from Iraq would be ''a terrible mistake.'' A12 A Debate Over Inmate Labor Louisiana inmates are regularly used as cheap or free labor, digging graves and tending the athletic fields at local private schools. While many people say they could not get by without it, critics say that local sheriffs use inmate labor to curry political favor and to line their own pockets, taking a large cut from whatever pay the inmates might receive. A1 Homes for Destitute Alcoholics Some of Seattle's ''unsympathetic homeless'' -- those who beg, drink, urinate and vomit in public -- now have brand-new, government-financed apartments where they can drink as much as they want, part of an experiment to ease the torment of drug and alcohol addiction while saving taxpayers' money.

It's so fast and easy, and the results are so reliably good, that it makes sense to grill some eggplant whenever you've got the grill going. That's because grilled eggplant is also terrific at room temperature. This dish is a creamy and mild eggplant salad made with a quick dressing of yogurt and seasonings. You can grill the eggplant half an hour before you serve the salad, or a half a day (or longer) ahead; it doesn't matter much at all."

A pioneer in television broadcasting, producer/director Jack Sameth introduced TV audiences to the things he loved most-music, great talent and the wonders of science and the human body. Mr. Sameth died Tuesday from a heart attack. He was 79. He began his career at a time when television was almost always live, and in black and white. He covered the first Americanmanned space flight, directed and produced specials on his idols Benny Goodman and Peggy Lee, and was the executive producer of televised concerts at the White House. But music wasn't his only passion. He produced the awardwinning series, ''The Brain'', followed by its sequel, ''The Mind'', both aired on PBS. He also directed and produced many programs with Bill Moyers and, in between, became a network executive at ABC where he supervised live prime-time programming. Sameth retired in 1996 and spent most of his time in Northport, LI. Mr. Sameth is survived by his beloved sisters, Lois Geldermann and Dorothy Buswell. A service will be held at Nolan & Taylor Howell Funeral Home in Northport on saturday at 11:30 am. A further celebration of his life will be held in NYC in the Fall."

2006-07-06T00:00:00Z,"Sean Connery in Book Deal Sean Connery, right, is taking on the role of author. Mr. Connery, best known for his film portrayals of James Bond, is writing a book that mingles Scottish history with autobiographical anecdotes, Reuters reported. Canongate Books of Edinburgh, which said it had acquired the world English-language rights in conjunction with Polygon, said the book, ''Connery's Scotland,'' would be published in September 2007 to coincide with the 300th anniversary of the political union of Scotland and England. Mr. Connery, 75, who was born in Edinburgh but now lives in the Bahamas, has said he would not live in Scotland again until it becomes independent. In writing the book, he will collaborate with Murray Grigor, a writer and filmmaker. In a statement Mr. Connery said, ''Our goal is to produce a very readable, visually stimulating and hopefully intriguing history of Scotland, with personal discoveries.'' Canongate declined to reveal Mr. Connery's advance, but two years ago, when the newspaper The Scotsman reported that he was interested in writing his memoirs, it said he could expect bids of $5.5 million or more from publishers. Keith Richards Turns Pirate Keith Richards, right, the Rolling Stones guitarist who was Johnny Depp's role model when he created his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow for the first two ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' movies, is going to join the cast of the third, The Associated Press reported. The producer Jerry Bruckheimer said that Mr. Richards would have a cameo as Sparrow's father in the next film, scheduled to begin filming next month. Mr. Depp, who has said he adopted Mr. Richards's body language and mannerisms to become Captain Jack, said, ''We're all looking forward to the idea of Keith coming in.'' CD Packaging Gets a Reboot Facing competition from online music stores like iTunes, the world's biggest record company, Universal Music Group is striking back by giving the CD a makeover, Reuters reported. Universal is introducing three tiers of CD packaging in Europe, from deluxe editions (probably about $25) to new stronger super jewel boxes ($19) and bare-bones cardboard sleeves ($12) intended to compete with albums sold online. Most music is still sold on CD's. ''We thought we should reboot the consumer's experience of buying CD's,'' said Max Hole, executive vice president for marketing and A&R at Universal Music Group International. ''Ninety percent of what we sell is physical goods, and the CD hasn't had much of a revamp in the last 20 years.'' Protests by Gays Scrub Buju Banton Concert Gay protesters in Brighton, the English seaside resort, have prompted cancellation of a concert by the Jamaican dancehall reggae star Buju Banton, Reuters reported. Mr. Banton, whose lyrics have been described as homophobic, was to have performed last night at Concorde 2. In a statement on its Web site, www.concorde2.co.uk, Concorde 2 referred to lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender protesters when it said, ''Due to unprecedented pressure from the council, members of the LGBT community and the police, Concorde 2 have been left with no choice other than to cancel.'' The statement said that Concorde 2 feared losing its license and being closed if the concert took place. The club had given assurances that Mr. Banton would not perform ''Boom Bye Bye.'' Mr. Banton has been at odds with gay-rights advocates since 1994, when he recorded ''Boom Bye Bye,'' a homophobic anthem that speaks of shooting gay people. In 2004 he and other popular dancehall reggae acts were forced to cancel engagements in Europe and North America after protests by gay groups that their music promoted violence against homosexuals. The Gang's All Here Paulie Walnuts and Silvio Dante ain't going nowhere. They will be back for the final season of ''The Sopranos'' next year, after the actors who portray them -- Tony Sirico, above left, and Steven Van Zandt, above right, respectively -- reached agreement with HBO to end a salary dispute and continue in ''The Sopranos,'' an Emmy Award-winning series, Reuters reported.

Glucksman, esteemed alumnus, admired trustee, magnificent benefactor, and cherished friend. After receiving his M.B.A. degree from NYU, he went on to fulfill the promise of his education: he had an outstanding career in finance that included the chairmanship of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., the positions of co-chief executive, president, and chief operating officer of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, and the post of executive vice-president of Fireman's Fund Insurance Company. His generous support of NYU's business school made possible the Lewis Glucksman Institute of Research in Securities Markets, enhancement of the library, and the creation of fellowships in support of the school's faculty. He also served the school with noted distinction as a professor of business administration. In addition, with his wife, Loretta Brennan Glucksman, his generosity led to the creation of NYU's renowned Glucksman Ireland House. Our community will cherish the memory of this generous and wise, kind and good man, and his wonderful legacy of achievement.

2006-07-06T00:00:00Z,"TRUE, there were no cone bras, Marie Antoinette wigs or clouds of sheer, virginal tulle. But Madonna's concert June 28 at Madison Square Garden was an occasion to trot out get-ups so giddy and hypertheatrical that they competed with the styles onstage. A simultaneous nod to the current 80's revival, with its leggings worn with jeweled tunic tops, and to Madonna herself, they made for an eye-popping fashion retrospective. Many of those looks, worked to the hilt by middle-age fans and teenagers alike, recalled the more memorable personas adopted by the pop chameleon over time. Madonna, 47, can still bring out the girlie-girl in her admirers, as illustrated by those who filed into the Garden that night -- women, and quite a few men, brazenly tricked out in striped tube dresses, fingerless gloves, fishnet hose, feathery boas and glitter pants. Others wore paddock boots and waved riding crops in rapt emulation of their idol."

You'll note that Qaddafi is pictured entirely alone with the ball, with no other players, fans, or indeed Bond-villain-style female bodyguards anywhere in sight. This is likely because he made it known in the section of his guide to revolutionary living, the Green Book, that deals with ""Sports, horsemanship and the stage"", that he was no fan of spectator sports. Indeed, Qaddafi's belief that ""sports are like praying [or] eating"" led him to the conclusion that as ""it would be foolish for a crowd to enter a restaurant to watch one or more persons eating,"" so all sports should be practiced rather than watched."

I wanted picnic wines that could play well with others, that could get along with deviled eggs, potato salads, ham sandwiches and mosquitoes. The best summer wines don't ask you to think too hard about what is in the bottle; they have a nice acidity, forward fruit and a clean finish. They like being chilled. Toward the end of both cases, I have tired of neither, perhaps the highest compliment for hot-weather wines."

2006-07-07T00:00:00Z,"When executed at its highest level, ballet is one of our most sublime art forms, wordlessly yet eloquently speaking to the full range of human experience. A night at the ballet offers glamour and magic in a world disastrously short on both. And trot those tired old charges -- elitist and old-fashioned -- back into their stalls. Ballet also offers kinesthetic pleasures on par with a night at the amusement park, without the threat of nausea. Nowhere is this delicious combination of excitement and art more apparent than in the men of American Ballet Theater, who will be on full display this weekend during three performances of ''Le Corsaire,'' the final shows of the group's spring season. No one would mistake this silly jumble for a masterpiece, but no matter: sometimes beauty and bravura make their own meaning. The justly celebrated poster boy for this is Herman Cornejo, who never lets his virtuosic abilities upstage his artistry; it's impossible to follow his leaps and arcs across the stage without feeling your own seat-bound muscles, particularly your heart, respond. You can catch him tonight, as the treacherous pirate Birbanto. Also on tap is Angel Corella, who throws himself into the role of the adoring slave Ali with equal parts abandon and camp. Mr. Corella dances the role tonight and tomorrow evening, while the princely Jose Manuel Carreño performs it in the matinee. Never has a slave seemed less servile. The actual leading man, the dashing pirate Conrad, will be danced, in order, by David Hallberg (above), Marcelo Gomes and Maxim Beloserkovsky. My money's on Mr. Gomes, but really you can't go wrong.

A pioneer in television broadcasting, producer/director Jack Sameth introduced TV audiences to the things he loved most-music, great talent and the wonders of science and the human body. Mr. Sameth died Tuesday from a heart attack. He was 79. He began his career at a time when television was almost always live, and in black and white. He covered the first Americanmanned space flight, directed and produced specials on his idols Benny Goodman and Peggy Lee, and was the executive producer of televised concerts at the White House. But music wasn't his only passion. He produced the awardwinning series, ''The Brain'', followed by its sequel, ''The Mind'', both aired on PBS. He also directed and produced many programs with Bill Moyers and, in between, became a network executive at ABC where he supervised live prime-time programming. Sameth retired in 1996 and spent most of his time in Northport, LI. Mr. Sameth is survived by his beloved sisters, Lois Geldermann and Dorothy Buswell.

This always buzzed-about summer showcase includes ''DruidSynge,'' the complete works of John Millington Synge, and ''Grendel,'' an opera directed by Julie Taymor. Sites in and around Lincoln Center; (212) 721-6500. 'NO CHILD' Previews start tomorrow. Opens July 16. The chameleonic Nilaja Sun returns with her acclaimed solo show about the New York public school system (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village; (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE HOUSE IN TOWN' A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, back in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD' Orran Farmer's two-character drama about a struggling playwright and a drug-addicted actress-stripper is well-meaning but tedious and often trite (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231.(George Hunka) 'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'TROUBLE IN PARADISE' Ernst Lubitsch's 1932 film comedy about a con man, the con woman he loves and a wealthy Parisian widow lives again as a giddy, good-looking, quietly amusing play (1:30). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Gates) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE BUSY WORLD IS HUSHED' With the Episcopal church in a tizzy about homosexuality and that intriguing new gospel of Judas the subject of much speculation, Keith Bunin's play about conflicts of family and of faith arrives at a propitious moment. Jill Clayburgh stars as an Episcopal minister with a troublesome son and what may be an undiscovered Gospel. Engaging, if a little too tidy (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'GODOT HAS LEFT THE BUILDING' John Griffin's homage to Samuel Beckett's classic play nails the master's comedy but falls short of his lyricism, though it features fine performances from Scott David Nogi and Edward Griffin (2:00). 45 Below Theater, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Hunka) 'MACBETH' As Mr. and Mrs. MacB, Liev Schreiber and Jennifer Ehle inscribe thoughtful studies in the excesses of ambition and the ultimately annihilating prickings of conscience. But in Moisés Kaufman's elegantly wrought production set in the tumultuous 1930's, the Macbeths' murderous rampage unfolds at an oddly stately pace. Blood flows regularly, but as if it's being dispensed from silver taps. Despite the intelligence and craft of their performances, neither Mr. Schreiber nor Ms. Ehle seems to inhabit fully the darkness of their characters. (2:25). Delacorte Theater, Central Park West and 81st Street, (212) 539-8750; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will & Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley) 'THE WATER'S EDGE' In a bold surgical endeavor that recalls the experiments of the mad Dr. Frankenstein, Theresa Rebeck has tried to transplant the big, blood-engorged heart of a Greek tragedy into the slender body of a modest American comic drama. The resulting hybrid runs amok in a stylishly acted production, directed by Will Frears and starring Kate Burton and Tony Goldwyn (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott) * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis) 'THE BLOOD OF MY BROTHER' (No rating, 84 minutes, in English and Arabic) Another documentary about the occupation of Iraq; another heartbreak; another protest; another dead brother; another necessity. (Nathan Lee) 'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott) 'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis) 'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis) * 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright, and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott) 'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott) * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden) 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Lee) 'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES' (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis) 'THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL' (R, 88 minutes) The post-9/11 self-absorption of a handful of New Yorkers. Occasionally well observed, but mostly irritating and contrived. (Scott) 'THE GREAT YOKAI WAR' (No rating, 124 minutes, in Japanese) From the prolific Japanese cult director Takashi Miike comes this extravagantly imagined fable about a boy who joins a band of cute magical creatures locked in an apocalyptic struggle against some who are much less cute. (Scott) 'THE HIDDEN BLADE' (R, 132 minutes, in Japanese) Set in 1861 at the tail end of Japanese feudalism, ''The Hidden Blade'' focuses on a gentle samurai balancing his love for a low-caste servant girl and his mission to kill a traitorous friend. By taking samurai-movie conventions and placing them in the harsh light of daily survival, the director, Yoji Yamada, is illuminating the twilight of an entire way of life. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden) 'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott) 'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden) 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis) * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden) * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis) 'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden) 'ONLY HUMAN' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Spanish) When a Jewish girl takes her Palestinian fiancé home to meet the parents, the encounter sets off a series of zany, romantic and potentially tragic misadventures during one eventful night in Madrid. (Laura Kern) 'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis) * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott) 'THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantánomo Bay, Cuba. (Scott) * 'ROOM' (No rating, 75 minutes) Engulfed by nightmares, blackouts and the anxieties of the age, a Texas woman flees homeland insecurity for a New York vision quest in this acute, resourceful and bracingly ambitious debut film. (Lee) 'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden) 'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott) 'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis) * 'TWO DRIFTERS' (No rating, 98 minutes, in Portuguese) From the dexterous mind of João Pedro Rodrigues comes a bizarre love triangle like no other. Two gay boys (one of whom is dead) are reunited with the help of an enigmatic girl on roller skates in a metaphysical melodrama about grief, love, hysterical pregnancy and the transmigration of souls. (Lee) 'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis) 'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall. (Scott) 'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden) * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis) 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis) Film Series ESSENTIAL WILDER (Through July 20) Film Forum's three-week retrospective of the work of the great Polish-born director and screenwriter Billy Wilder (1906-2002) continues today and tomorrow with ''Sunset Boulevard'' (1950), his classic Hollywood drama about a young screenwriter (William Holden) and an aging silent-screen star (Gloria Swanson). Sunday's screening is a romantic-comedy double feature: ''The Seven Year Itch'' (1955), in which Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell cope with a New York heat wave, and the lesser-known ''Kiss Me Stupid'' (1964), starring Dean Martin and Kim Novak as a second-rate singer and a small-town beauty. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-9110; $10. (Anita Gates) HEROIC GRACE: THE CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS FILM, PART II (Through July 20) The U.C.L.A. Film & Television Archive and the Film Society of Lincoln Center's sequel to a 2003 festival focuses on movies from the 1970's and early 80's. It begins on Wednesday with Chung Chang-wha's ''King Boxer'' (1972), about a champion fighter whose fingers are shattered, and Zhang Che's ''Five Venoms'' (1978), the story of a dying master seeking revenge on his former disciples. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates) HISTORIC HARLEM PARKS FESTIVAL: THROUGH AFRICAN EYES AND PRIZED PIECES (Through Aug. 3) This fifth-annual outdoor festival presents two South African films this week.

AMADOU AND MARIAM (Thursday) Known throughout West Africa as the Blind Couple From Mali, Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia have reached American listeners with a smooth eclecticism that on their album ''Dimanche à Bamako,'' last year, folded in reggae and some loose-limbed rock. At noon, BAM Rhythm & Blues Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, Downtown Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; free. (Ben Sisario) 'AMERICAN IDOL LIVE' (Sunday and Thursday) The 10 finalists from Season 5 of ''American Idol'' logged about a million yeah-yeah's and baby-baby's on television, and here they come on tour with who knows how many more: Taylor Hicks (the winner), Katharine McPhee (the runner-up), Ace Young, Bucky Covington, Chris Daughtry, Elliott Yamin, Kellie Pickler, Lisa Tucker, Mandisa and Paris Bennett.

(Jon Pareles) GORAN BREGOVIC WEDDING AND FUNERAL ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Goran Bregovic, a Yugoslav composer whose moody and stylized take on Balkan Gypsy music is featured in many films by Emir Kusturica, makes his New York debut as part of the Lincoln Center Festival. He brings a 40-piece group to perform his cycle ''Tales and Songs From Weddings and Funerals.'' At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 and $40. (Sisario) * CAMERA OBSCURA (Tonight) Like their fellow Glaswegians Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, led by the lovably plain-voiced Tracyanne Campbell, is in love with wistful 1960's folk-pop and plays a country-leaning variation on it with taste and finesse. With Georgie James and the Metronomes. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario) KELLY CLARKSON (Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) The first ''American Idol'' champion, who won two Grammysand had the third-best-selling album of 2005, Ms. Clarkson is the best proof yet that reality television might not be a bad idea. With Rooney. Sunday at 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698; sold out. Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8, Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000; sold out on Wednesday, $29.50 to $75 on Thursday. (Sisario) * ELVIS COSTELLO AND ALLEN TOUSSAINT (Monday and Tuesday) After Hurricane Katrina, Elvis Costello made a fruitful reconnection with Allen Toussaint, the veteran New Orleans songwriter and pianist with whom Mr. Costello had worked in the 1980's. They recorded ''The River in Reverse'' (Verve Forecast), an album of bittersweet parables about loss and perseverance, and are now touring together, with a 10-piece band that seamlessly commingles Mr. Costello's Imposters and Mr. Toussaint's Crescent City Horns. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $53.50 to $95. (Sisario) FRUIT BATS (Thursday) The Fruit Bats, from Chicago, play weightless little nuggets of psych-folk that are deceptively wistful. Behind their apparent melancholy is a playful wit and a modest awe: ''It takes leviathans down in the abyss,'' sings Eric Johnson, the band's leader. ''The hidden messages of the things that you missed.'' With Higgins. At 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sisario) HAKIM (Tomorrow) Hakim is a superstar in his native Egypt, singing a high-energy dance update of shaabi, an irreverent and streetwise pop style. (Its name means ''of the people.'') He borrows Western beats, and some big Western voices too -- the stars with whom he has sung include James Brown and Olga Tañón. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. (Sisario) COLIN HAY (Thursday) Not all former pop stars age as gracefully as Mr. Hay, who in the 1980's was the voice and face of the Australian new-wave oddballs Men at Work.

With Bigger Thomas. At 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212) 941-8100; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) JOLIE HOLLAND (Tuesday) With a playful quiver of a voice that can make her resemble a countryfied Billie Holliday, and a junk-shop aesthetic that mingles brassy swing with Appalachian folk, Ms. Holland sings charming and deceptively childlike songs: ''Crush in the Ghetto,'' on her new album, ''Springtime Can Kill You'' (Anti-), is a wry, greet-the-morning scene that finds her overdressed on a bus ride home from a one-night stand. At 8 p.m., Canal Room. (See above.) $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario) * LES SAVY FAV, BEANS, DRAGONS OF ZYNTH (Sunday) The most exciting news about the summer concert season is the unexpected arrival of the McCarren Park Pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The first concert features the arch postpunk band Les Savy Fav, the alternative rapper Beans and Dragons of Zynth, a talked-about new band whose sound is called ''Afrotek.'' If you have ever been curious about how amplified music will sound bouncing off the walls of a 50,000-square-foot concrete pool, here is your chance. At 3 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, thepoolparties.com; free. (Sisario) BARRINGTON LEVY (Tonight) Mr. Levy pioneered dancehall reggae a quarter-century ago, and his distinctive wail remains one of the genre's most stirring sounds. With Patrick Junior.

(Kelefa Sanneh) LIFETIME, THE BRONX (Tomorrow and Sunday) Lifetime was a standard-issue hardcore punk band from New Jersey in the mid-1990's -- lots of slashing, melodic guitars and accusatory lyrics -- that has been enjoying a small renaissance since reuniting recently, after almost a decade. The Bronx -- which hails from Los Angeles, not New York -- plays a violently propulsive and proudly obnoxious kind of strut-punk that comes down from Black Flag and the MC5. With the Loved Ones. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; sold out. (Sisario) MAIN SQUEEZE ACCORDION FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) The lineup of this all-day squeezebox affair gives an indication of the surprising diversity of accordion music and its players. The Main Squeeze Orchestra, a 15-member, all-female group, begins the festival, followed by the inventive contemporary composer Guy Klucevsek, the norteño group Proyeccion Nortena, the traditional Irish playing of the John Nolan Trio, the artsy Phoebe Legere Experience, the Balkan Brothers, the Dominican merenge group Ernestidio y Su Conjunto, and the Cajun style of the Jesse Lege Bayou Brew.

Mouthus, a fearsomely unpredictable duo from Brooklyn, delves into guttural depths of guitar and vocals, and Coughs, a six-piece band from Chicago, offers tortured singing above a malevolent rumble of percussion. Also on the bill are members of the clamorous Sightings and the gloomy but strangely not very noisy Bret Gand Is Dead. At 8, Goodbye Blue Monday, 1087 Broadway, at DeKalb Avenue, Bushwick, Brooklyn, (718) 453-6343; $8. (Sisario) * ONEIDA (Thursday) Things are best in Oneida songs when the various patterns of drums, keyboards and guitar converge into powerful, pulsating drones that seem to summon some primordial rock energy. And though this veteran Brooklyn band's new album, ''Happy New Year'' (Jagjaguwar), also toys with some medieval-ish folk, there is plenty of that eerie, cathartic drone. With Dirty Faces, Company and Knyfe Hytes. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10 in advance, $12 at the door.

(Sisario) DAVID LEE ROTH (Thursday) The latest project by the former lead singer of Van Halen, ''Strummin' With the Devil'' (CMH), is an album of bluegrass versions of the band's songs, on which Mr. Roth sings a few.

(Sisario) SOILENT GREEN (Sunday) Soilent Green, from Louisiana, seems hell-bent on reinventing Southern rock in its own gloomy image.

(Pareles) UNCLE MONK (Monday) There is life after the Ramones, but who knew that its sound would be bluegrass? Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this new acoustic duo, singing tautly written songs -- much like Ramones songs, but with tenderness -- about the comforts and subtle politics of home life. At 9 p.m., Parkside Lounge, 317 East Houston Street, between Clinton and Attorney Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 673-6270; $5. (Sisario) YO LA TENGO (Thursday) This enduring indie-rock band, with its lean guitar riffs and feedback excursions, takes a detour into soundtrack territory.

At 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Pareles) YURA YURA TEIKOKU (Tomorrow and Sunday) Long a major player in Japan's garage-punk-revival scene -- which is bigger, and better, than you might think -- this three-piece band made a splash at its first New York concerts last year, and returns for two more. With dry, bluesy guitars and strutting rhythms, it has perfected a stylish synthesis of the sounds of ''Beggars Banquet''-era Rolling Stones and scraggy 1960's psychedelic groups like the 13th Floor Elevators. Tomorrow night at 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. Sunday night at 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10.

BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs.

REZ ABBASI AND SNAKE CHARMER (Tuesday) Mr. Abbasi's most recent album, ''Snake Charmer'' (Arabesque), infuses traditional North Indian motifs with rock bombast, jazz flexibility and a Hammond B-3 organ; in some ways this guitarist and his band offer a postmillennial update of the 1970's fusion of the Mahavishnu Orchestra.

(Chinen) DARCY JAMES ARGUE'S SECRET SOCIETY (Tonight) As the name implies, this 18-piece big band is calibrated for maximum intrigue, with a sound that suggests Steve Reich minimalism as well as orchestral jazz in the lineage of Bob Brookmeyer. The band includes hale improvisers like the trumpeter Ingrid Jensen, the tenor saxophonist Jeremy Udden and the trombonist Alan Ferber. At 8, Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, near Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 614-0505; cover, $10.

Opera GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tonight through Monday) This company's productions almost invariably end up at New York City Opera, and lots of people drive to Cooperstown to get an early glimpse of what's on the way. But Glimmerglass, with its intimate, comfortable and up-to-date house, is a vastly better place to see and hear these productions than City Opera's cavernous New York State Theater. The company opens its season with a light work, the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta ''The Pirates of Penzance'' in a production by Lillian Groag. Alternating with ''Pirates,'' through Monday, is Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' in a production by Leon Major.

Tomorrow night, Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore'' takes the stage in a production directed by David Grabarkewitz and conducted by Brent McMunn. From all reports the casts are young, eager and gifted. Both Mozart's and Donizetti's stories of confused young lovers can gain extra poignancy when performed by emerging artists. ''Così Fan Tutte'': tonight at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; ''L'Elisir d'Amore'': tomorrow at 8 p.m. Berlind Theater at the McCarter Theater Center, 91 University Place, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787; $42 to $49.

Tomorrow and Sunday Dvorak's exquisite and rarely heard Terzetto figures into a program that also includes string quartets by Haydn and Beethoven, and Gyorgy Ligeti's Sonata for Solo Cello, to be played by Nicholas Canellakis.

(Kozinn) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Philharmonic's Summertime Classics series -- conceived as a way for the orchestra to get its money's worth from the players during the off weeks of late June -- is back. The idea is to present programs of mostly lighter and familiar fare at reduced ticket prices. Still, last summer Bramwell Tovey proved not only a lively conductor but also an avuncular host whose comments to the audience were witty and informative. The series ends this weekend with Mr. Tovey conducting Rossini's ''Barber of Seville'' Overture, Saint-Saëns's ''Carnival of the Animals,'' Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Capriccio Espagnol'' and Ravel's ''Boléro.'' Are there four more familiar and popular pieces in the repertory? At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $19 to $49.

The Philharmonic's dynamic associate conductor, Xian Zhang, offers two Tchaikovsky works, the ''Festival Coronation March'' and the Violin Concerto (with the charismatic violinist Jennifer Koh as soloist), and Dvorak's exuberant Symphony No. 8.

(Holland) * TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Sunday) When James Levine injured his shoulder early this year, forcing him to cancel his conducting commitments for the rest of the season, his doctors said he would most likely be ready to conduct when Tanglewood opened. Some doubt remained until recent weeks, but Mr. Levine said he would be up for the opening program, tonight, in which he is to lead the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1 and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. His soloists are Sondra Radvanovsky, Wendy White, Clifton Forbis and John Relyea. Bernard Haitink then takes over the rest of the weekend, for programs of Ravel, Mozart, Debussy and Roussel tomorrow evening, and Sibelius and Mahler on Sunday afternoon.

(Jennifer Dunning) Chunky Move (Tuesday through Thursday) Apparently, Australian men have dancing difficulties too. Perhaps not these particular men, though; employing video montages and interviews, the members of the physical Australian troupe Chunky Move channel their inner wallflowers in ''I Want to Dance Better at Parties.'' Through July 15. At 8 p.m., the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $36. (Claudia La Rocco) PAULA HUNTER (Monday through Thursday) Ms. Hunter will perform ''I Am Karen Finley,'' an absurdist performance solo, as a free dance installation in a window in the theater district.

(Dunning) * JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) The Suzanne Farrell Ballet from Washington will be in the larger Ted Shawn Theater through the weekend in an all-Balanchine program, followed there on Wednesday and Thursday (and next weekend) by Tania Pérez-Salas's company from Mexico.

(John Rockwell) * LA MAMA MOVES! (Tonight through Sunday) Six choreographers from around the world, including Bill Irwin, will perform in ''Border Jumping'' in the closing weekend of this festival, whose curators were Nicky Paraiso and Mia Yoo. Tonight through Sunday night at 7:30. ''Mavericks in Motion,'' featuring nine choreographers who include Justin Montalvo, Christopher Morgan and Kate Weare, will also be performed. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2:30 and 8 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; $10 (Dunning) * NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tomorrow) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, has settled into the intimate Theater 80 until the end of the month, although this week there will be only two performances. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45. (Rockwell) PAUFVE DANCE (Tonight through Sunday night) From San Francisco, Randee Paufve and her dancers, who range in age from 22 to 72, will present ''The Big Squeeze,'' a program of dances about love, home, space and place. At 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 334-7479 or www.paufvedance.org; $15; $13 for students and 65+. (Dunning) * ROXANE BUTTERFLY (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Djellaba Groove'' ain't your grandmother's tap. This performer mixes in flamenco, multilingual spoken word and North African rhythms to give this New World art form some Old World flair. And it gets better: her show is paired with the terrific Noche Flamenca at the SummerStage performance. Tonight, 8 to 10:30, summerstage.org Free. Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200 or telecharge.com; $15 (La Rocco) * TAP CITY (Sunday through July 22) Six years ago the irrepressible Tony Waag, fed up with the lack of performing opportunities for tap dancers in New York, started this festival. Who says you can't please all of the people all of the time? From rarely seen films to master classes with and performances by today's brightest American and international hoofers, Mr. Waag's boisterous creation promises something for everyone. From 8 to 11 p.m., the festival opens with a free tap jam at Pier 63 Maritime, West 23rd Street at the Hudson River, Chelsea. For a complete festival schedule, visit atdf.org. (La Rocco) DUSAN TYNEK DANCE THEATER (Thursday) Dusan Tynek, from Czechoslovakia, trained with Aileen Passloff at Bard College. He will present two premieres, one inspired by sinister 19th-century Czech ballads and set to string music by classical and contemporary composers, and the other set to music by Michael Galasso. Through July 16. At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, artists and 65+. (Dunning) VON USSAR DANCEWORKS (Thursday) Astrid von Ussar, a Slovenian modern-dance choreographer now based in New York City, will present four new and recent pieces, including her new ''23 hours,'' set to music by Graeme Ravell. The program features a dance by Mojca Ussar, her sister. Through July 16. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $25 for opening night performance and reception. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman) Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Sept. 3. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Roberta Smith) * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) * International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck) * Metropolitan museum of art: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. Further sharpness comes from the placement of all parts of the altarpiece at eye level, creating a viewing intensity that more than compensates for the fact that they have not been reassembled. (212) 535-7710. (Smith) * Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter) Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith) * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400. (Smith) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman) * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter) NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck) * The Whitney Museum of American Art : 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. If ''Full House'' is about one thing, it is about discord, about how harmonious America never was. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith) * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street * HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.' This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 28. (Smith) * Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by this young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design; and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea 'Air' This appealing, understated show organized by the painter Amy Sillman includes Benjamin Butler's lush, Mondrian-style painting of trees; Pat Palermo's semi-abstract drawings of wrecked cars and other curious subjects; John White Cerasulo's watercolor of a bare-chested wilderness giant; Pamela Wilson-Ryckman's flickering picture of a scattering crowd of people; and abstractions in various styles by Robert Bordo, Jenny Monick, Howard Smith, Laura Newman and Patricia Treib. Monya Rowe, 526 West 26th Street, (646) 234-8645, through July 28. (Johnson) 'Everywhichway' This lively show of artists working inventively between abstraction and representation includes Katherine Bradford's whimsical images of ships and the sea; Chris Martin's updated Tantric art; Sigrid Sandström's Arctic icescapes; suave, retro-Modernist pattern paintings by Jennifer Riley and Colin Thomson; Harvey Tulcensky's finely textured ballpoint-pen fields; and compact, sensuous ceramic slabs by Joyce Robins. Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (212) 691-6565, through July 28. (Johnson) 'The Sanctuary and the Scrum' A diverting, pluralistic show inaugurates a new Northwest Chelsea exhibition space. It includes good abstract and semi-abstract paintings by Jessica Dickinson and Andrew Guenther; a stuffed swan shorn of its feathers from the head down by Jane Benson; a gleaming crutch covered by tiny mirror facets by Kristian Kozul; and a funny photo-conceptual project about grocery store shopping carts by Julian Montague. Black & White, 636 West 28th Street, (212) 244-3007, through July 29. (Johnson) Martin Schoeller: 'Close Up' Extraordinarily large and detailed mug-shot-like portraits of celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Sept. 1. (Johnson) * Vivan Sundaram: 'Re-Take of Amrita' The photographs in this beautiful, time-haunted show are all of past generations of the Indian artist Vivan Sundaram's family, and include images of his aunt, the famed modernist painter Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941). Thanks to digital technology, those generations mix in logically impossible combinations. The resulting pictures embody the past the way it survives in the mind: edited, layered, compressed, as if in a dream. Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, 11th floor, (212) 645-9444, through July 28. (Cotter) Other Galleries Christine Osinski: 'Notes From West Brighton' Ms. Osinski took the visually and sociologically gripping photographs in this exhibition on Staten Island, where she lives, in the early 1980's and the early 90's. These exceptionally lucid black-and-white pictures of nondescript neighborhoods, grocery store customers, small-town parades, self-consciously posing teenagers and abandoned wrecked cars were made with an affectionately cool, clear eye for the beauty and weirdness of ordinary people and places. Silo, 1 Freeman Alley, East Village, (212) 505-9156, through July 30. (Johnson) Last Chance Eva Lundsager: 'Wherever' Improvising with infectiously playful freedom on medium-large canvases, Ms. Lundsager creates hedonistic and trippy abstract landscapes composed of dots, squiggles, woozy stripes, smudgy areas, luminous open spaces, and colors ranging from neon bright to muddy brown. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444, closing today. (Johnson) MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' . Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Met, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of its department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710, closing Sunday. (Glueck) 'Nightmares of Summer' This entertaining selection of dark, weird and nasty visions includes Marilyn Minter's big photograph of dirty feet with toenails painted fashionably green; Barnaby Furnas's explosive, cartoonish painting of a woman at the beach spilling blood-red wine; an otherworldly coppery seascape by Stuart Elster; photographs by Anders Petersen, Hans Bellmer and Diane Arbus; drawings by Carroll Dunham and Steve DiBenedetto; and more. Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-3363, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) HALSEY RODMAN: 'THE NAVIGATOR'S QUARTERS MUST NOT BE DISTURBED' A solo debut introduces a multi-talented sculptor who lets his work bog down in an obscure narrative, but still cuts loose with a sufficiently engaging array of techniques, materials and colors. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 625-9224, closing tomorrow. (Smith) 'Scarecrow' The work in this show is supposed to be menacing and abrasive, but it is mostly interesting and amusing. Highlights include David Herbert's giant, handmade replica of a ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' videocassette; Rashid Johnson's life-size, photographic nude self-portrait; David Kennedy Cutler's model of the White House made of chewing gum and imbedded in dirt; and a short Matthew Barney-like film by Chris Larson. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-3323, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) * Stephen Shore The postcard-size color pictures of diners, restaurant meals, hotel rooms, roadside signs, ordinary people and other nondescript subjects taken by this eminent photographer on cross-country road trips in the early 1970's are enthralling, beautiful, nostalgic and romantic. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121, closing today.

2006-07-07T00:00:00Z,"Jeremy Pelt has been heralded, with good reason, as one of the major new trumpet talents to make a mark on jazz's postmillennial landscape. Mr. Pelt, who will turn 30 in November, has an incisive command of his instrument, along with a full, dark-hued tone; at times he can sound like the Freddie Hubbard of the 1960's. The catch is that Mr. Pelt, above, professes no interest in emulating Mr. Hubbard, or Miles Davis, to whom he is also reflexively (and less credibly) compared. He called his last album ''Identity,'' and its release on the MaxJazz label last year came as a rebuke to anyone who assumed he was still searching for one. Some of the best moments on the album conjured the exploratory mode of late-60's postbop with a gimlet-eyed practicality that left little room for nostalgia. Mr. Pelt takes a similar approach with Creation, an ensemble he formed nearly four years ago that has yet to issue a studio album. (Some tracks recorded a few years ago can be found in Mr. Pelt's ''MP3 Live Series,'' a laudably extensive audio archive maintained at www.peltjazz.com.) Creation consists of Mr. Pelt on trumpet, Myron Walden on alto saxophone and bass clarinet, Mike Moreno on guitar, Warren Wolf on vibraphone, Derek Nievergelt on bass and Tommy Crane on drums. It's Mr. Pelt's only band without a pianist, a distinction that tilts his improvisation toward the open-ended and celestial, appropriate qualities for the Rose Center for Earth and Space, which plays host to the band this evening. (Tonight at 6 and 7:30, Rose Center for Earth and Space, American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 81st Street, 212-313-7278, www.amnh.org/rose/specials/jazz.

That's what the people at the USA Network are hoping with this new comedydrama series in which James Roday plays the son of a cop (Corbin Bernsen) who uses his extraordinary observation skills -- and his best friend (Dule Hill, above right, with Mr. Roday, center and Mr. Bernsen) to convince an entire police department that he's psychic. 7 P.M. (Animal Planet) ULTIMATE DOG CHAMPIONSHIPS -- North America's top canine athletes and their handlers strut -- as well as weave, jump, bob and run -- their stuff in the Agility National Championships in Montreal. 8 P.M.

(Sundance) ASSISTED LIVING (2003). A janitor at a nursing home only adds to an Alzheimer patient's confusion when he makes prank phone calls posing as relatives - including the dearly departed. Still, he cares. This debut film from Elliott Greenebaum was filmed at three actual assisted-living facilities and features some of the residents in supporting roles. 9 P.M. (PBS) BILL MOYERS ON FAITH AND REASON -- ''The people who do achieve great things are also people who have fatal flaws,'' says Jeanette Winterson, the author of ''Lighthousekeeping'' and ''Sexing the Cherry,'' who was brought up in England by Pentecostal parents and sermonized on street corners before being excommunicated from the church for falling in love with a woman. ''Do we have the power to rule our own destiny, or are we destined to make the same mistakes as our foremothers and our forefathers?'' asks Will Power, (above) a hip-hop playwright, actor and educator who fuses traditional drama and African storytelling in works like ''Flow'' and ''The Seven.''

2006-07-07T00:00:00Z,"Diner's Guide presents excerpts from recent restaurant reviews. Parea While some restaurants that promise updated, upscale takes on Greek food deliver moussaka in souped-up settings, Parea comes through with dips and sauces that put yogurt and feta to modulated, subtle, inventive use; nuggets of lamb's brain atop a tangle of frisée; a branzino roasted in grape leaves and accompanied by sweet onions instead of salty capers; and more. It's a serious effort by a sophisticated chef (Michael Symon, a culinary superstar in Cleveland), but the setting -- sleek and sexy, with a halo of orange light that evokes sunset at Delphi -- isn't disregarded. 36 East 20th Street; (212) 777-8448. Mezedes (small plates) and larger appetizers, $7 to $15. Entrees, $21 to $29. ** [Rating: Two Stars] Mr. Chow Tribeca Mr. Chow Tribeca opened more than a quarter-century after the Mr. Chow on East 57th Street, but stays true to its predecessor's formula: a mixture of familiar and less familiar Chinese food in a slick setting with formally attired servers and an aura of clubby exclusivity. It can be amusing, and a few dishes, like the Peking duck, were terrific. But paying exorbitant prices for appetizers and main courses that don't improve significantly on cheaper analogues around town doesn't ultimately make much sense. And the servers all seem to have cash registers in their eyes. 121 Hudson Street, at North Moore Street, TriBeCa; (212) 965-9500. Entrees, $26 to $36. Satisfactory. Degustation Jewel Bako One of the many progeny of Jewel Bako, Degustation is actually contiguous to it, a 16-seat, U-shaped counter wrapping around an open kitchen. The intimate arrangement works, primarily because most of the modestly portioned dishes, which use Spanish new-wave flourishes and recall tapas, are wonderful . Open since 2001, Jewel Bako itself still has an impressive array of sushi and sashimi, some of it very fine. But a crowded field of competitors has raised the sushi bar. The restaurants share an address and phone: 239 East Fifth Street, East Village; (212) 979-1012. Degustation: small plates, $4 to $16. Five-course tasting menu, $50. ** [Rating: Two Stars] Jewel Bako: Individual pieces of sushi and sashimi, $3.50 to $12. * [Rating: One Star] Dona Dona promisingly combines the talents of an ambitious chef (Michael Psilakis of Onera) and a shrewd restaurateur (Donatella Arpaia of davidburke & donatella). He's Greek, she's Italian, and this pretty, pampering restaurant is a little of both and a lot of neither, vaulting past ethnic tags into the frillier realm of haute hodgepodge. The raw seafood compositions are terrific, while other dishes, including pasta, sometimes suffer from too much aspiration: an overload of effects. 208 East 52nd Street, Midtown, (212) 308-0830. Pasta dishes and entrees, $19 to $45. ** [Rating: Two Stars] What the stars mean: (None) Poor to satisfactory; * Good; ** Very good; *** Excellent; **** Extraordinary."

2006-07-07T00:00:00Z,"From cathedrals on Fifth Avenue to messages of millennial hope and doom scrawled on ghetto walls, New York is shot through with signs and symbols of religious belief. Larry Racioppo, who is in his day job the official photographer for the New York Department of Housing Preservation and Development, has been assiduously cataloging vernacular displays of Roman Catholic devotion since 1989. The approximately 80 examples of his work at the Museum of Biblical Art offer a fascinating window onto this easily overlooked dimension of metropolitan life. Among the most striking are color pictures of elaborate, spray-painted memorial murals. One dedicated to someone named Mike, above, has a pair of B.M.W.'s parked in front of a glowing vision of the archangel Michael slaying the Devil. Mixtures of the sacred and the profane run through out, as in the rear view of a woman with a bejeweled gold cross hanging from a chain over tattooed flaming letters that spell ''Hot and Sexy'' across her back . Other photographs depict the God Bless Deli in Brooklyn; an early-20th-century family chapel built of stone in the Bronx; the Biblical verse John 3:16 printed on a T-shirt; a beautiful Staten Island grotto; and a simple wooden cross bearing the words ''In Memory of Pablo'' affixed to a bridge support in Queens. Mr. Racioppo studies his subjects with sympathetic interest, neither satirizing nor proselytizing. You don't have to be devout yourself to be touched by the human yearning for supernatural meaning that his photographs evoke. (Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, 212-408-1500.

The theater, which blends American Sign Language and spoken English, learned in 2004 that it was one of several arts groups sharing this specialty whose longtime federal financing was not being reauthorized by Congress. Without the money, it has been unable to resume its adult productions or restart its summer training academy for deaf and hearing-impaired actors. Lt. Gov. Kevin B. Sullivan said the state's Commission on Culture and Tourism would provide $200,000 to the group over the next 12 months. ''This is one show that simply must go on,'' he said.

2006-07-07T00:00:00Z,"The New York City metropolitan area will receive $53.8 million in federal antiterrorism grants to protect its rail, bus and ferry systems, a 25 percent increase over last year, the Department of Homeland Security announced yesterday. The additional money may curtail some of the criticism of a 40 percent cut announced on May 31 in a separate, larger antiterrorism grant program. The new grant money -- $47 million for rail, $5.5 million for bus systems and $1.3 million for ferry security -- means the New York area will get nearly 44 percent of the total transit grants distributed this year. ''The Department of Homeland Security is finally putting some of its money where its mouth is and seems to have realized that New York City's subways and buses remain under constant threat,'' Senator Charles E.

2006-07-08T00:00:00Z,"<b>Ralph Deeds, Birmingham, Mich.</b>: It appears to me that the politics of global warming is more difficult than the science. For example, existing automobile technology could produce a huge savings in oil if our Congress would stop debating flag burning and pass legislation to encourage more fuel-efficient motor vehicles. This could easily be done by gradually increasing the gasoline tax to bring pump prices up to European levels. Phasing in the tax increase over several years would give drivers and car companies time to adjust to the production and sale of smaller, more fuel efficient cars. The downside of a big gas tax increase is that it would be regressive, bearing most heavily on those least able to afford it. An alternative would be a vehicle weight and or horsepower tax. Likewise, technology exists for cleaner power production if there were the political will to require the power companies to use it."

A1 Iraqi soldiers stormed a building in Baghdad, killing or wounding between 30 and 40 gunmen and capturing a high-level Shiite militia commander, the American military command said. A9 Five Killed in Gaza Clashes Another five Palestinians were killed in more sporadic clashes across northern Gaza, as relatives and militants mourned those killed in fierce fighting with Israeli troops.

A5 Bush Reacts to North Korea President Bush said he believed the nation's missile defense system would have had a ''reasonable chance'' of shooting down a missile launched by North Korea, and he said he was determined to use the United Nations to set ''red lines'' for North Korea's behavior. A5 Japan introduced a Security Council resolution calling for sanctions against North Korea for its missile test-firings, but China opposed the move.

Five other men are being sought for their alleged involvement in the plan. A1 New Jersey's Budget Woes Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey has shown his political rivals that he has the resolve to win a showdown with a Legislature grown accustomed to borrowing with abandon. But his budget plan will probably have only a modest effect on the factors that have made New Jersey, one of the nation's richest states, one of the most fiscally troubled.

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"It is a joyous scene of country life. Two men, shirts undone, celebrate the harvest, dancing a jig to a fiddler's tune. Soft afternoon light floods the barn siding where a boy keeps time with crude drumsticks. Farm workers look on, clapping, from the back of the barn; a dog eyes a cat under the floorboards. William Sidney Mount painted ''Dance of the Haymakers'' on a farm near present-day Stony Brook in 1845, and the image resonates with the optimism and pioneering spirit of post-Revolutionary War American life. The painting takes pride of place in the main room of ''Painters for a New America: Works by William Sidney Mount and Shepard Alonzo Mount,'' a new exhibition at the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"The commentators who have done live play-by-play of the soccer matches on the World Cup blog of The New York Times -- Jeff Z. Klein, Rob Mackey, Victor Mather, Duncan Irving and Austin Kelley -- have heard from fans around the world. Here, based on what they have seen, read and experienced, are the 10 top moments from the elimination rounds. 1. Zidane and the Old Guard ''YOU'LL SEE -- I'M SUPERCONFIDENT we'll be in Berlin on July 9,'' said Zinédine Zidane on the eve of the tournament. Nobody really believed him. But in the swan song of his illustrious career, Zidane, 34, has been a master of unparalleled grace in leading France to the final. He isn't the only member of the ancien régime who has enjoyed a renaissance; so have France's Lilian Thuram, 34, Claude Makelele, 33, and Patrick Vieira, 30; Italy's defender Fabio Cannavaro, 32; and Germany's goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, 36. After this tournament, where Gillette sponsors an award for young players not yet able to shave, perhaps FIFA can ask Geritol to create an award for next time around. 2. Fat Ronaldo's Stepover CRITICIZED BY EVERYONE, including the president of Brazil, for being overweight and slow and weird on the field, Brazil's striker Ronaldo managed a stepover feint so deft he actually faked Ghana goalkeeper Richard Kingson to the ground as he scored a record 15th World Cup goal. We should all be so slow and so weird. But when Brazil lost to France, 1-0, Ronaldo and his teammates went home to cries of national shame -- all the 3-0 victories forgotten, all the Nike ads of Brazilian magic stored away in mothballs. 3. Like Any Other Country THE UNITED STATES CRASHED out of the tournament against Ghana after a dismal performance and some strange refereeing decisions. Hundreds of readers on the Times blog went ballistic. Fire Bruce Arena! Get rid of all the players! The ref robbed us of what little chance we had! In the hysteria of their response, American soccer fans sounded, marvelously, just like everyone else in the world. 4. Graham Poll's Gaffe THANKS TO JOSEPH S. BLATTER's incomprehensible instructions to crack down on fouls, this has been a tough World Cup for referees, who for a couple of weeks were handing out bookings in record numbers. The Englishman Graham Poll had the worst of it, issuing a second yellow card to Croatia's Josip Simunic, forgetting to send him off, remembering a few minutes later, showing a third yellow and a red, and waving off a late Australia insurance goal in the process. Poll retired from the international game afterward -- but Blatter, FIFA's president, remains. 5. Three Characters In Search of a Farce A MOMENT OF SUBLIME COMEDY toward the end of the fractious, absurdly refereed match between Portugal and the Netherlands: the three players sent off in the second half, Portugal's Deco and the Netherlands' Khalid Boulahrouz and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, sat together on a step watching the end of the game. Deco and van Bronckhorst, teammates at Barcelona, chatted amicably enough, but Boulahrouz, sent off because the ref had been conned by a bit of play-acting from Deco's teammate Luís Figo, sat stunned and glaring at Deco through the game's last farcical moments. 6. How to Beat Germany IN THE QUARTERFINAL against Germany, Argentina's coach, José Pekerman, tried to protect a 1-0 lead and left swift attackers like Javier Saviola and Lionel Messi on the bench. But when the Germans equalized late, Argentina had no offense to reply and lost on penalties. In the Germany-Italy semifinal, Italy's Coach Marcello Lippi knew better. He inserted attacker after attacker and went for broke with four forwards -- and when Fabio Grosso scored in the 119th minute, it was a triumph not only for Italy, but also for positive, adventurous soccer. 7. Too Much Emotion? AT THE BOHEMIAN BEER GARDEN in Astoria, Queens, the Germany-Italy semifinal was the World Cup in microcosm. As the beer flowed and the scent of grilling sausages filled the air, hundreds of fans of both teams cheered and chanted relentlessly while the game played on five outdoor screens. Suddenly, after more than two hours of unendurable tension and with penalties looming, a lightning goal for Italy -- and then another. Fans of Germany wept openly; right next to them, fans of Italy exulted in boundless joy. For a neutral, the depth of emotion was almost unbearable. Just maybe the World Cup should be abolished, for the sake of everyone's sanity. 8. From Heartthrob To Villain PORTUGAL'S BACK-HEELING, bicicleta-pedaling Cristiano Ronaldo was acclaimed for his skills and good looks. But in the quarterfinals he incensed English fans by appealing to the referee to have Wayne Rooney (justly) sent off and winking when the red card was shown. In the semifinal against France, he was booed constantly and vilified for diving whenever challenged. Defiant to the end, Ronaldo left the France game saying, ''I was pleased about being booed.'' Then he complained about the referee. 9. No Hablan Fútbol SOME TOURNAMENT GAMES have been the United States' most-watched sports event of the day. But the great untold story of the World Cup in the United States may well be the level of viewer dissatisfaction with ABC/ESPN's coverage. The Times blog has received hundreds of complaints about the gaps in knowledge and the penchant for rambling, off-the-point discussions during play by the lead announcing team, Dave O'Brien and Marcelo Balboa. The complaints come from longtime soccer fans and first-time viewers equally -- and at least half say they have switched off ABC/ESPN and are watching in Spanish, a language many of them do not understand. According to Crain's Television Week, as many as 30 percent of Univision's World Cup viewers do not speak Spanish. Since Univision's audience for the tournament is almost as large, it suggests that ABC/ESPN has actually chased away a large portion of its viewers. 10. The Perfect Hosts GERMANY 2006 has been one enormous, good-natured, monthlong party. Whether at fan fests across the country, where millions have eaten, drunk, celebrated and made friends, or in the superb, atmospheric stadiums, the German people have been generous and laid-back hosts, fans and even contributors to the Times blog, unfailingly gracious in victory or defeat. For visiting fans from around the world, there has never been a better World Cup."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"FOR years, opponents of sprawl have argued that the growth of suburbs and exurbs saps the vitality of central cities. They claim that the result has been homogenous, affluent, white bedroom communities at the urban periphery, and at the core an increasing number of poor and minority neighborhoods. They also blame sprawl for longer commuting times, more traffic congestion and increased pollution. Many of these observers hailed recent news from the Census Bureau that New York City is expected to grow by more than a million people by 2025. Some have even suggested that this might mark the end of suburban growth in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York as people move back toward the center to take advantage of shorter commuting times, more demographic diversity and all the other benefits that higher-density living can bring."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"FOR years, opponents of sprawl have argued that the growth of suburbs and exurbs saps the vitality of central cities. They claim that the result has been homogenous, affluent, white bedroom communities at the urban periphery, and at the core an increasing number of poor and minority neighborhoods. They also blame sprawl for longer commuting times, more traffic congestion and increased pollution. Many of these observers hailed recent news from the Census Bureau that New York City is expected to grow by more than a million people by 2025. Some have even suggested that this might mark the end of suburban growth in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York as people move back toward the center to take advantage of shorter commuting times, more demographic diversity and all the other benefits that higher-density living can bring."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"Chamnan Lim, a daughter of Lone Srey of Silver Spring, Md., and the late Lim Ho, was married at her mother's house on Friday evening to Sophal Ear, a son of Cam Youk Lim of Fremont, Calif., and the late Ear Muy Cuong. The Rev. Elaine S. Banks, an American Baptist minister, officiated at the nondenominational ceremony. Yesterday, Ponlork Le, a member of the board of the Cambodian Buddhist Society in Maryland, led a traditional Cambodian wedding ceremony, also at the home of the bride's mother. Mrs. Ear, 31, is a policy adviser to the United Nations Development Program on aid coordination for Cambodia; she works in Phnom Penh. She graduated from Frostburg State University in Maryland, and received an M.B.A. from Johns Hopkins University. Her mother retired as a seamstress and a housekeeper at the J W Marriott Hotel in Washington. The bride's father was a medical paraprofessional in Neak Ta, Cambodia."

Schmidt calls these ads ''a noble attempt'' to introduce an honor code into the game."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"While there is no shortage of chief executives who have taken extraordinary compensation while running their companies into the ground, there are also plenty who have been paid modestly in comparison to how much their companies have prospered. The Corporate Library, a watchdog group in Portland, Me., recently cited 10 of them. Together, these executives were paid $190 million in salary, bonus and stock over the last five years while their companies posted total gains -- dividends and rising stock prices -- of $82.7 billion. Some were particular bargains. The new chief of AutoZone, William C. Rhodes, for example, was paid only 24 percent of the median salary-bonus-and-options package of other chiefs in the auto products industry. Over the last five years, AutoZone has had a total return to shareholders of 255 percent."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"According to the press materials, ''Uncertain States of America'' at the Center for Curatorial Studies Gallery at Bard College is a rollicking selection of contemporary artworks promising a frank assessment of the current state of American art, culture and society. But the bulk of these works are oblique and often annoyingly perverse, having less to say about life in the United States than they do about the confused state of the contemporary art world. That said, there is some fine work here. Three European curators, Daniel Birnbaum, Hans Ulrich Obrist and Gunnar Kvaran, made the selections. It apparently took them two years of research and more than 500 studio visits to come up with the 40-something artists in the show, many of whom are young, though already seasoned exhibitors."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"Last month the Supreme Court offered self-indulgent state legislatures the judicial equivalent of a hot fudge sundae when it mostly approved the wildly partisan Texas redistricting plan engineered by former Representative Tom DeLay. It was a depressing outcome and one that made it even more critical that local elected officials be mobilized to adopt more equitable methods of drawing political boundaries. That is very much the case in New York, which suffers from a different form of compulsive gerrymandering than Texas. Instead of manipulating geography to give one party the political edge, the New York State Legislature -- divided for so long between a Republican Senate and Democratic Assembly -- tends to stick to protecting incumbents."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"OVER the last few years, as its residents fought a battle against the city to keep their homes, the Fort Trumbull neighborhood of New London looked more and more like a war-torn village, with acres of vacant lots interrupted intermittently by debris and a few scattered houses. Fort Trumbull was at the center of a national debate over eminent domain last year after the United States Supreme Court ruled that the city could take residents' homes and transfer them to a private developer to put up new housing, offices and a hotel. Of the seven property owners who sued the city, the final two agreed on June 30 to settle, ending the battle."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"Tiny as it is, Olé Molé, a taqueria in a small strip mall in Stamford, packs a big wallop -- largely because of its salsas. There are seven made daily on the premises (as are the chips); the mildest is the salsa verde (a blend of tomatillos, chiles, cilantro, onion and garlic); the most incendiary is the chile de arbol (roasted tomato, onion, garlic and chile de arbol). The five other gradations fall in between. All the salsas add extra punch, though every dish I tried was well seasoned in and of itself, from the four types of quesadillas, to burritos, tacos, tortas and platillos, or main entrees. Olé Molé has been in the same location for more than 10 years and still turns out fresh and appealing Mexican food, prepared quickly and served by a friendly, smiling staff. The takeout business looks to be thriving, but I enjoy eating in. The cheerful, crowded quarters consist of four brightly painted concrete tables along a short wall, and a counter with stools facing the street. There are two tables outside, for those intrepid enough to endure the noise and fumes of a main thoroughfare."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"THIS is determination: ordering legislators to report to Trenton and delivering the same message to them at 9 o'clock, morning after morning. Gov. Jon S. Corzine probably had ways of dealing with the legislators privately, and even making them miserable, but in the past week's budget battle, his stoic face on television sent a wider signal about which side would be more immovable. When Mr. Corzine did prevail, as fellow Democrats in the General Assembly finally agreed to vote for his budget, he surprised some of those who had sized him up six months ago. That was when he arrived at the State House, keeping mostly to himself, wearing a sweater vest and tending to mumble."

Winthrop Paul Rockefeller returned to his home here on Saturday after months of treatment at a Seattle cancer clinic, including two bone marrow transplants that failed to cure a blood disease that can lead to leukemia, a spokesman for his family said. Mr. Rockefeller, 57, announced last year that he had received a diagnosis of myeloproliferative blood disorder and would obtain care from the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, a consortium of research and treatment facilities."

Iraq still exists on a map, but it no longer functions as a single country. We're trying to build national institutions right now -- like the army and the police -- when there is no nation."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"OVER the last few years, as its residents fought a battle against the city to keep their homes, the Fort Trumbull neighborhood of New London looked more and more like a war-torn village, with acres of vacant lots interrupted intermittently by debris and a few scattered houses. Fort Trumbull was at the center of a national debate over eminent domain last year after the United States Supreme Court ruled that the city could take residents' homes and transfer them to a private developer to put up new housing, offices and a hotel. Of the seven property owners who sued the city, the final two agreed on June 30 to settle, ending the battle."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"FOR years, opponents of sprawl have argued that the growth of suburbs and exurbs saps the vitality of central cities. They claim that the result has been homogenous, affluent, white bedroom communities at the urban periphery, and at the core an increasing number of poor and minority neighborhoods. They also blame sprawl for longer commuting times, more traffic congestion and increased pollution. Many of these observers hailed recent news from the Census Bureau that New York City is expected to grow by more than a million people by 2025. Some have even suggested that this might mark the end of suburban growth in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York as people move back toward the center to take advantage of shorter commuting times, more demographic diversity and all the other benefits that higher-density living can bring."

FOR all its familiarity Mozart's ''Zauberflöte'' remains an elusive opera. On the one hand it is just a charming fairy tale, a singspiel with spoken dialogue written for what was essentially a people's theater offering lowbrow musical comedies complete with stage effects and magic tricks. Yet ''Die Zauberflöte'' is also a musically sophisticated and deeply spiritual work about a truth-seeking young prince swept into a confusing battle between forces of enlightenment and evil."

Known as Glenmont, the estate, which sits on about 15 acres, was reopened to the public last month after a three-year, $1 million restoration by the National Park Service, which administers the property. The work on the house mainly involved the installation of a sprinkler system and a geothermal heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system."

In the hamlet of Edgemont, to name one trouble spot, the smooth unfolding of everyday life is being ruffled by a battle over sidewalks.

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"CAPE CANAVERAL The News -- The space shuttle Discovery safely lifted off and later docked with the International Space Station. Behind the News -- The flight was the shuttle system's first in a year, and only the second since the Columbia disintegrated on re-entry in 2003, killing the seven-member crew. In this launching there appeared to be no major damage from foam insulation falling off the shuttle's external fuel tank, a problem that had doomed Columbia and that had cropped up again on the flight a year ago. But if NASA seemed to have taken care of one headache, it faced longer-term ones: how to re-establish a presence in space with a diminished shuttle fleet that is expected to be retired in 2010, and how to fight a perception that its programs, particularly the space station, lack purpose. NORH KOREA The News -- North Korea went on a rocket-launching spree, firing at least seven missiles over the Sea of Japan, including one that is designed to be able to reach Alaska. Behind the News -- The long-range missile, the Taepodong 2, failed or was aborted shortly after launching and fell into the Sea of Japan. But some United States officials said even a failure would provide some valuable information for the North Koreans, who seem intent on developing a long-range missile capability. The White House, which had long ignored Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, has more recently tried to engage him in diplomacy, urging international support for strong measures, including sanctions, to get the country to drop its weapons program. But China and Russia resisted the move. THE MIDDLE EAST The News -- Hamas militants fired a small rocket deeper into Israel, prompting the Israeli military to move farther into Gaza. Behind the News -- The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, called the Qassam rocket fired from Gaza that landed in Ashkelon, a city of 115,000 six miles from the Gaza border, an ''escalation without precedent.'' It and the other launchings were also evidence that the Israeli strategy of positioning troops just inside Gaza was ineffective. So the military moved farther into the territory, taking up positions near abandoned Israeli settlements. Prime Minister Olmert faced a delicate balancing act: pushing militarily against Hamas while trying to get the organization, and its military wing, to release a captured Israeli soldier. WASHINGTON The News -- Central Intelligence Agency officials said the agency had closed a unit that had hunted for Osama bin Laden. Behind the News -- The disbanding of the unit, which had been in operation since long before the Sept. 11 attacks, is a sign of increased concern that other groups have begun carrying out attacks independent of Mr. bin Laden, and that Al Qaeda is a more decentralized organization than it once was. Agency officials said that while efforts to capture Mr. bin Laden were as strong as ever, the better plan was to focus on regional trends rather than specific individuals or groups. But one former senior C.I.A. official said the closing would hurt the search for the Qaeda leader. ATLANTA The News -- Federal agents in Atlanta foiled a plot to sell Coca-Cola Company secrets to PepsiCo. Behind the News -- A Coca-Cola employee and two other people were arrested and charged with stealing the information and trying to sell it for $1.5 million to PepsiCo, which alerted Coca-Cola officials to the plot. The authorities said they had videotaped one of those arrested, an executive administrative assistant at the company, stuffing documents into bags and holding a small vial containing a product sample. It appeared that the purloined information concerned a beverage under development; a Coca-Cola spokesman said the most jealously guarded secret, the recipe for Coca-Cola Classic, was safe and sound. The company said it would tighten security."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"Last month the Supreme Court offered self-indulgent state legislatures the judicial equivalent of a hot fudge sundae when it mostly approved the wildly partisan Texas redistricting plan engineered by former Representative Tom DeLay. It was a depressing outcome and one that made it even more critical that local elected officials be mobilized to adopt more equitable methods of drawing political boundaries. That is very much the case in New York, which suffers from a different form of compulsive gerrymandering than Texas. Instead of manipulating geography to give one party the political edge, the New York State Legislature -- divided for so long between a Republican Senate and Democratic Assembly -- tends to stick to protecting incumbents."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"FOR years, opponents of sprawl have argued that the growth of suburbs and exurbs saps the vitality of central cities. They claim that the result has been homogenous, affluent, white bedroom communities at the urban periphery, and at the core an increasing number of poor and minority neighborhoods. They also blame sprawl for longer commuting times, more traffic congestion and increased pollution. Many of these observers hailed recent news from the Census Bureau that New York City is expected to grow by more than a million people by 2025. Some have even suggested that this might mark the end of suburban growth in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York as people move back toward the center to take advantage of shorter commuting times, more demographic diversity and all the other benefits that higher-density living can bring."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"Jere Longman breaks down a few matchups in today's World Cup final between Italy and France. Gennaro Gattuso ITALY MIDFIELDER VS. Zin.dine Zidane FRANCE PLAYMAKER Gattuso is a relentless irritant on defense, clogging the middle, tackling fiercely, disrupting the flow of an opponent's offense. Zidane is the French playmaker, clever with the ball and always a threat to score. At 34, he is playing in his final match before retirement, which should provide him with even more incentive to win a second World Cup in eight years. Fabio Cannavaro ITALY DEFENDER VS. Thierry Henry FRANCE FORWARD Stocky and muscular in central defense, Cannavaro, Italy's captain, has anchored a defense that has allowed only one goal in six matches -- a ball Italy kicked into its own net against the United States. Marcello Lippi, Italy's coach, calls him the best defender in the world. Henry is fast, elegant and possesses a great finishing touch. His volley defeated Brazil in the quarterfinals, and his run into the box drew a penalty kick that defeated Portugal in the semifinals. First goal wins The 2006 World Cup is on course to produce the lowest scoring total since the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Heading into yesterday's third-place match, this tournament had averaged only 2.27 goals, the lowest since 1990, when 2.21 goals a game were scored. The losing team in a World Cup final has not scored a goal since 1986, which means the first one to put the ball into the net today would seem to have a huge advantage."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"A new show every Tuesday for 10 crazy weeks: that was summer stock on the straw-hat circuit, so named for its informality compared with the fancy-dress season in town. What ISAIAH SHEFFER remembers most fondly about his own time in those trenches 40 years ago is the ''intimacy and unpretentiousness'' of the offerings. More recently Mr. Sheffer, who is now 70, sought to revive the tradition, not in lakeside vacation communities but in Manhattan, where he is artistic director of Symphony Space. For the last four years off-season renovations to the three-theater complex interfered, but finally this month he's inaugurating SUMMER STOCK ON BROADWAY, which he hopes will be an annual event. First up: a ''newly discovered lost musical'' by RODGERS AND HART. If you've heard Mr. Sheffer play host to Symphony Space's ''Selected Shorts'' series, you know his impish humor, so it's no surprise that despite his claim to have found the score in the same Secaucus warehouse ''where they find all the old musicals,'' ''MANHATTAN MADCAPS OF 1924'' is a fake. Having secured the patchwork of rights to perform 22 Rodgers and Hart songs -- from familiar classics (''He Was Too Good to Me'') to extreme obscurities (''Stonewall Moskowitz March'') to some that are both (three early versions of ''Blue Moon'') -- Mr. Sheffer hired one Jerzy Turnpike (who oddly resembles his boss) to fashion a libretto at least as inane as the shows and movies from which the songs were extracted. The result, which is now in previews and opens Thursday in the 99-seat Leonard Nimoy Thalia, certainly replicates the intimacy and unpretentiousness of summer stock that Mr. Sheffer treasured, and even the low prices. All he needs now are the feral mosquitoes. Through July 23, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $19."

The reaction in George W. Bush's home state to the administration's handling of Katrina, Oshinsky said in an e-mail message, was ''one of shock and embarrassment.'' The president ''is popular here and remembered by most as having been an effective state leader. Texans expected a whole lot more from him.'' In contrast, he added, ''Gov. Rick Perry, a conservative Republican, led a heroic effort to welcome more than 250,000 Katrina refugees. Houston became the epicenter, but every town pitched in. Here in Austin, 5,000 evacuees were provided housing, clothing, health care, counseling, even library cards.

Fort Trumbull was at the center of a national debate over eminent domain last year after the United States Supreme Court ruled that the city could take residents' homes and transfer them to a private developer to put up new housing, offices and a hotel. Of the seven property owners who sued the city, the final two agreed on June 30 to settle, ending the battle."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"Early this summer, after a little sampling, I settled on two house wines to see me through Labor Day. I wanted picnic wines that could play well with others, that could get along with deviled eggs, potato salads, ham sandwiches and mosquitoes. The best summer wines don't ask you to think too hard about what is in the bottle; they have a nice acidity, forward fruit and a clean finish. They like being chilled. Toward the end of both cases, I have tired of neither, perhaps the highest compliment for hot-weather wines. The first is the 2005 Mulderbosch Cabernet Sauvignon Rosé, from the sweeping Stellenbosch region of South Africa. Uncomplicated, with a light acidity, the Mulderbosch is a little bolder than the grenache-based rosés of southern France. Watermelon pink, with notes of grapefruit and strawberries, it's a good match with potato chips. The label lore suggests pairing it with crab cakes, fruit-glazed pork chops, ratatouille and strawberries and cream -- the makings of a pretty fine picnic right there."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"Even after his recent conviction in a state bribery case, HealthSouth's former chief executive, Richard M. Scrushy, faces many more days in court. Mr. Scrushy, who was acquitted last year of participating in a $2.7 billion accounting fraud at HealthSouth, was convicted last month of arranging a payment of $500,000 to Donald E. Siegelman, the former Alabama governor, in exchange for a seat on the board of a state hospital regulator."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"Next weekend a couple of overstuffed concerts take over the city. One is a New York tradition. And the other definitely isn't. The New York tradition is the SIREN MUSIC FESTIVAL, presented by The Village Voice, which will swamp Coney Island for the sixth year on Saturday. The festival, as always, is free and packed full of indie rock acts. One of the oddest things about Siren is that it scarcely seems to reflect the musical or demographic diversity of the city's music scene, even the city's downtown music scene. And compared with the three major indie-rock festivals that will hit Chicago this summer (the recent Intonation, along with the forthcoming Pitchfork and Lollapalooza), this one seems slightly lacking in big names. Then again, Siren is free, and surely the pink-skinned, glassy-eyed fans staggering down the boardwalk won't be in a mood to complain. This year's headliners include the petulant Canadian indie-pop act STARS, the blithe and absurd British band ART BRUT, the exuberant neo-glam band SCISSOR SISTERS and SHE WANTS REVENGE, the shameless Los Angeles gloom-pop band. (You'd think a self-respecting New York audience would boo those guys off the stage.) The full schedule is at villagevoice.com/siren. The other, distinctly nontraditional New York concert is KENNY CHESNEY's current tour, which is to touch down at Madison Square Garden on Friday. Mr. Chesney is a laid-back country singer whose obvious influences include Jimmy Buffett and James Taylor; his radio-ready hits (he recently topped the country charts with a sweet, straightforward song called ''Summertime'') and exuberant arena shows have made him one of the country's most popular singers, though he rarely plays Manhattan. On Friday he is to be joined by DIERKS BENTLEY (whose hits include the shrugging break-up song, ''Settle for a Slowdown'') and the ''American Idol'' winner CARRIE UNDERWOOD, who established herself as a country-pop star with the smash ''Jesus, Take the Wheel.'' The concert is sold out, but resourceful New Yorkers should be able to figure out a way in."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"THOMAS EDISON was a 39-year-old widower with three children when he married for a second time, in 1886. As a wedding present, he gave his new bride, Mina Miller, a 29-room Queen Anne-style home in the exclusive Llewellyn Park section of West Orange, about a mile from his famous laboratories. Known as Glenmont, the estate, which sits on about 15 acres, was reopened to the public last month after a three-year, $1 million restoration by the National Park Service, which administers the property. The work on the house mainly involved the installation of a sprinkler system and a geothermal heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In ''The End of Authorship'' (June 25), John Updike misses the very real, very financial impact the Internet is having on writers. For example, according to Publishers Weekly, Updike's latest book, ''Terrorist,'' has an announced first printing of 150,000 copies. It lists for $25, but Amazon sells it for $15, and new and used copies are available for $12. I can buy one of those $12 copies, pay about $3 in postage, and sell it again on Amazon a few weeks later for just about what I paid for it. Total cost for enjoying Updike's insights and exquisite prose: about $3. The publisher and author are paid for one copy that is read by many individuals for the price of the postage. Thus, as my wife and frequent co-author, Emily, suggests, in the future only 10,000 or fewer copies of most books will ever be printed. The first print run will be the only print run. And thanks to Amazon and the Internet, those copies will endlessly circulate through cyberspace like some sparkling cloud -- a veritable Van Allen belt of books! It's always been difficult to make a living as a writer. The Internet makes it impossible, at least if you insist on sticking to the conventional print paradigm. Alfred Glossbrenner Yardley, Pa. The writer is the author or co-author of approximately 60 books. To the Editor: John Updike's fond remembrance of bookstores throughout his life closely parallels my own. But an alarming, and increasing, number of people do not have any access to bookstores. Nor, for that matter, do they have access to libraries. In these circumstances, how are we to foster a love of reading? How are we to promote literacy? Digital books powered by reliable networks allow us partially to mitigate such circumstances. Digital books offer us a means to reach many people, including children, who would not otherwise have such access. By marrying simple, well understood lessons about networks, search and computer user experiences, we are today providing exemplary kids' literature to places as distant as the rural communities of Mongolia. And our books retain their edges. Tim Browne Manchester by the Sea, Mass. The writer is executive director of the International Children's Digital Library Foundation (www.childrenslibrary.org). To the Editor: The digital book will never replace the printed text as long as there are those who can appreciate the sensual experience of holding a book in their hands, as their eyes, sometimes guided by their fingers, work their way down the page -- pausing when they encounter a particularly complex passage that must be parsed and underscoring each line with a slow-moving finger until all the words coalesce into a thought. My lifelong commitment to books began when I discovered that beyond the circulation desk of the Scranton Public Library lay the stacks, which to me were the equivalent of the Emerald City. It was there that I learned how to hold, sometimes cradle, a book in my hands and lose myself in my discovery. I still wander through the stacks of the library at my university, always learning -- but never learned -- from whatever I take from the shelf, even if I only have time to read a chapter or two. I'm still making contact with something that I can touch, feel and reread without scrolling. Advice to all teachers: Play the Pied Piper and lead your students through the library stacks before they turn virtual. Bernard F. Dick Teaneck, N.J. The writer is a professor of communications at Fairleigh Dickinson University."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"SCHOOL superintendents in the metropolitan area are among the best paid public servants anywhere. In Westchester, the median base salary among the county's superintendents was $210,000 in 2005-6, which is more than the governor or the vice president makes, and many bring in much more than $300,000 in pay and benefits. Their defenders say that they make less than chief executives in the private sector who have companies with similar budgets. But critics say their salaries are inflated by cozy relationships with their boards."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"I read ''Things Fall Apart,'' Chinua Achebe's allegorical novel of Nigerian independence, when I was a schoolboy growing up in Australia. It was dazzling and heartbreaking. And when I had finished it, I flicked back through, marveling at the illustrations of African spirits and animals that divided the chapters. Many years later, when much of the book had faded from my memory, I was astonished to see the creator of those illustrations featured in a current exhibition at the Newark Museum. He is Uche Okeke, who is now 73 and one of Nigeria's foremost modern artists."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"THOMAS EDISON was a 39-year-old widower with three children when he married for a second time, in 1886. As a wedding present, he gave his new bride, Mina Miller, a 29-room Queen Anne-style home in the exclusive Llewellyn Park section of West Orange, about a mile from his famous laboratories. Known as Glenmont, the estate, which sits on about 15 acres, was reopened to the public last month after a three-year, $1 million restoration by the National Park Service, which administers the property. The work on the house mainly involved the installation of a sprinkler system and a geothermal heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"''Yi,'' the Chinese word for ''one,'' is the simplest of all characters, graphed by a single horizontal line. Writing ''Yi Yi'' looks like this -- -- and translates literally as ''one one,'' though its common usage signifies ''individuality.'' It also suggests a pun: stack ''one'' on top of ''one,'' and you get, naturally enough, the Chinese word for ''two.'' This neat bundle of multiple meanings provides the title for EDWARD YANG's masterly study of contemporary Taipei as experienced by three generations of the middle class. In America ''YI YI'' was subtitled ''A One and a Two'' (not that anyone ever called it that), a clever indication of the picture's essential qualities: how it swings with the verve and confidence of a great jazz tune, proceeds with mathematical precision, develops from an accumulation of minute observations and is characterized by calm, clearheadedness and serenity. Plotted from a wedding to a funeral, featuring dozens of characters and hundreds of incidents, ''Yi Yi'' commands the largest of stages while favoring the smallest of gestures. Despite its sprawl, it has the intimacy of a chamber piece, and is well suited to home viewing. Until now this has only been possible on a DVD of wretched image quality. A superb new packaging by the Criterion Collection, to be released on Tuesday, clarifies the wondrous things Mr. Yang can do with the reflection in a window or a roomful of bubblegum-pink balloons. ''Yi Yi'' is that rare subtitled masterwork bridging (semi-) popular enthusiasm with cinephile fervor, a movie for both the New Yorker set and subscribers to CINEMA SCOPE. Edited by Mark Peranson with contributions by an international roster of writers, this bimonthly Canadian magazine advocates for a passionate, political and purist engagement with the movies. The cover of Issue 27 displays a T-shirt reading ''Vote for Pedro,'' not in reference to the cult of ''Napoleon Dynamite,'' but to the Portuguese cineaste Pedro Costa, whose ''Colossal Youth'' was much abused at the recent Cannes Film Festival but vigorously championed in the magazine's pages. This Cannes-heavy edition also goes to bat for Richard Kelly's reviled ''Southland Tales,'' and spills happy ink on the latest by Richard Linklater among much else. A generous sample is available at cinema-scope.com, but you'll definitely want to nab a hard copy to read what Rob Nelson has to say about ''Marie Antoinette.''"
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"MATUTINOVIC--Zeljka (Suncica) Died Sunday July 2nd, on Martha's Vineyard. She was 41. While vacationing in Martha's Vineyard, she was in a traffic accident, and was reported dead at the Martha's Vineyard Hospital, shortly after. She is survived by her parents, Zeljko and Katarina Matutinovic, off of Zagreb, Croatia. Zeljka, a native of Croatia, was a beloved friend to many, and a highly accomplished professional. She earned a PHD degree in electrical engineering, from Princeton University, and had started her career at McKinsey and Company. Zeljka established a career in investment banking, working at Credit Suisse First Boston, International Real Returns LLC, and most recently, Jerusalem Venture Partners. Since 2005 she had been working to build her own investment firm. Zajka will be remembered for her sharp mind, generous heart, and the vibrant love of life. Her interests extended far beyond the business world, and included skiing, sailing, and biking. She also took pleasure in opera, and art. Zajka's bright smile was matched by her warmth, and infectious enthusiasm. She will be sorely missed by her family and friends. The funeral service will be held in Zagrev, Croatia, on July 12th. The memorial mass will be held on Tuesday July 18th, 7pm, at St. Cyril Catholic Church, at 502 W. 41st St., in NYC."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In the same issue of the Book Review in which Robert Stone argues for ''generosity and tolerance'' and against the ''vocabulary of dismissal'' in reviewing, I was disappointed to encounter Anthony Swofford's harsh appraisal of my book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'' (June 18). From Swofford's swipes, the reader would have no idea that ''2012'' weaves together ideas from such thinkers as Carl Jung, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Jean Gebser and Fritjof Capra, among others. I do not propose that ''near the end of 2012 the world as we know it will end,'' as Swofford misstates. Instead, I develop the hypothesis that we are already in a process of accelerated transformation, compelling an evolution in human consciousness, and I explore what this could mean for our world. While use of psychedelic substances in indigenous shamanic ritual is a strand of the book, it is only one of many elements, although Swofford does not bother to mention this. How sad that even today, 40 years after the social and cultural watershed of the 1960's, our media seem incapable of holding a serious -- or, apparently, even a civil -- discussion about the validity of non-ordinary states of consciousness. Our capacity for avoiding inconvenient truths appears to be matched by our inability to entertain transformative possibilities. Daniel Pinchbeck New York"

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"OVER the last few years, as its residents fought a battle against the city to keep their homes, the Fort Trumbull neighborhood of New London looked more and more like a war-torn village, with acres of vacant lots interrupted intermittently by debris and a few scattered houses. Fort Trumbull was at the center of a national debate over eminent domain last year after the United States Supreme Court ruled that the city could take residents' homes and transfer them to a private developer to put up new housing, offices and a hotel. Of the seven property owners who sued the city, the final two agreed on June 30 to settle, ending the battle."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"AFTER the death of Jackie McLean, jazz saxophonist and educator, on March 31, the jazz world turned its attention to Hartford. The globe-trotting musician was the most visible figure in the city's arts and education arena, helping to create and oversee two of its better-known institutions: the Artists Collective, a nationally recognized community education center on the North End that he founded with his wife, Dollie McLean, and the jazz program at the University of Hartford's Hartt School of Music, known since 2001 as the Jackie McLean Institute of Jazz. Both programs have nurtured thousands of young musicians since their start in the early 1970's, and along with other schools in the area, they have given Hartford credibility in wider jazz circles. The city has produced nationally recognized musicians like the pianist Brad Mehldau, who combines jazz with classical music and rock; Jimmy Greene, a rising young saxophonist with a busy international career; and Nat Reeves, a bass player who teaches at the McLean Institute. In addition, Hartford's location, midway between New York and Boston, allows it to attract some of the finest players in the Northeast."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"What if Tony Soprano were Irish, lived in Rhode Island and had a clean-cut brother in local politics? SHOWTIME is surely thinking forward to life after ''The Sopranos,'' and as a replacement proposes ''BROTHERHOOD,'' which has its premiere Sunday night at 10. JASON CLARKE stars as the Providence politician and family man, trying to avoid the rampant corruption around him. JASON ISAACS is his gangster brother, who has just come back to town after years on the run. There are suitcases full of money, suspicious construction sites and casual violence (including a severed ear in the first hour). The last few STEPHEN KING television projects haven't exactly been masterpieces. But the latest, ''NIGHTMARES & DREAMSCAPES: FROM THE STORIES OF STEPHEN KING,'' is at least highly ambitious. It's a four-week extravaganza of eight stories, beginning on Wednesday (TNT, 9 p.m.) with a commercial-free hour and a star turn by WILLIAM HURT. He plays a San Francisco hit man who kills a toy manufacturer, then finds himself under siege by an army of tiny plastic soldiers with surprisingly real weapons. That will be followed by CLAIRE FORLANI and EION BAILEY as newlyweds honeymooning in another dimension. The first season of the Showtime series ''WEEDS'' comes out on DVD on Tuesday (Lionsgate, $39.98). MARY-LOUISE PARKER, who beat out the ''Desperate Housewives'' stars for a Golden Globe, plays a tasteful suburban widow, soccer mom and marijuana dealer. Hey, how else is she going to keep her fabulous house? ELIZABETH PERKINS is her best friend (in a way), the most deliciously detestable role of her career. And now that Bruce Springsteen has gone folkie again, the latest ''AMERICAN MASTERS'' documentary, ''WOODY GUTHRIE: AIN'T GOT NO HOME'' (PBS, Wednesday, check local listings), seems timely. As the film puts it, Guthrie, who gave the world ''This Land Is Your Land,'' wasn't actually a hick, he just played one on radio."

Mr. Gottlieb, then president of Harry N. Abrams Books, was the emperor of coffee-table books. It might have been a perfect match, but the Abrams sales staff rebelled, Ms. Chamberlin recalls Mr. Gottlieb saying; the niche was too small to justify the expense. Ms. Chamberlin, a novice photographer and author, had already spent more than a year trailing the Halsey, Foster, Corwith and Zaluski families as they sowed and harvested their crops. Undeterred, she eventually shot 7,000 photos, assigned a season to each wall of a guest room in her house in Bridgehampton, and started tacking up her favorites."

I looked at my new friends, a pair of Serbian filmmakers and a Dutch backpacker I'd met in a cafe, and we tried to walk away. But his insanity was unavoidable, and soon we were a captive audience to his crackpot ramblings about Bill Clinton, Sept. 11 and the future of Albania. I'd been in Tirana less than four hours and, already, moments like these had ceased to faze me. I had arrived in Albania hoping to discover an untrammeled paradise hidden in the Balkans. What I found instead was a deeply weird place: a majority-Muslim country where the mosques are mute but the miniskirts are loud, where horse carts share highways with Hummers, and where people shake their heads to mean yes except that sometimes they shake their heads to mean no."
2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"THE CLOSED CIRCLE, by Jonathan Coe. (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.) This sequel to ''The Rotters' Club'' (2002) is both a satirical state-of-England saga and a close-up of one Benjamin Trotter. In ''The Rotters' Club,'' a novel of the 1970's set in Birmingham, Benjamin is a dreamy adolescent; ''The Closed Circle'' opens 20 years later, on Dec. 31, 1999, and Benjamin -- accountant, failing husband and would-be novelist -- is mired in the past. Coe follows the midlife surprises and disappointments of Benjamin; his brother Paul, a rising star in Tony Blair's New Labor government; and their old high school friends. In the Book Review, Jenny Turner described the novel's ''free-form, improvised'' quality: ''The effect is odd but also charming: sometimes bathetic, sometimes sublime.''"

He would walk up to the grassy, tree-lined bank and fish for striped bass with herring, or maybe chicken livers. The river had risen mightily back in 1955, but everybody said that was a biblical aberration, the storm of the century, and Mr. McCall was just a boy then in north Trenton, well beyond its reach. It didn't chase him out of his own home until September 2004, when it filled his basement with muddy water. Once every 50 years -- that seemed a reasonable price for the almost-country sweetness of life in the neighborhood called the Island, a stable, peaceful enclave cut off from the rest of the city by Route 29."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"SCHOOL superintendents in the metropolitan area are among the best paid public servants anywhere. In Westchester, the median base salary among the county's superintendents was $210,000 in 2005-6, which is more than the governor or the vice president makes, and many bring in much more than $300,000 in pay and benefits. Their defenders say that they make less than chief executives in the private sector who have companies with similar budgets. But critics say their salaries are inflated by cozy relationships with their boards."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"Deborah Solomon's interview of Jack Carter was fascinating (June 25). Jack says he doesn't have to be ''the best candidate in the world'' and that ''whenever you are going to be the best at something, then you give up an awful lot of stuff.'' For someone whose father's autobiography was titled ''Why Not the Best?'' I'm surprised Jack would have that point of view. Terence Kane Long Beach, N.Y."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"THOMAS EDISON was a 39-year-old widower with three children when he married for a second time, in 1886. As a wedding present, he gave his new bride, Mina Miller, a 29-room Queen Anne-style home in the exclusive Llewellyn Park section of West Orange, about a mile from his famous laboratories. Known as Glenmont, the estate, which sits on about 15 acres, was reopened to the public last month after a three-year, $1 million restoration by the National Park Service, which administers the property. The work on the house mainly involved the installation of a sprinkler system and a geothermal heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system."

2006-07-09T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''How to Educate Young Scientists'' (editorial, July 3): I am fortunate that as a scientist I work with bright people from around the world. The problem with science in the United States is not a failure to educate and inspire, but a failure to retain.

Some episodes have the added obstacle of cramped, New York City living quarters. (Is that a bathtub in your kitchen?) Tonight, Valerie Grubb (above left, with the other contestants Joshua Warr, Cindi Avila, Nikki Thompson and Martin Szymanski) opens her 400-squarefoot apartment to the others for a dinner party themed ''Late Night Nibbles.'' 8 P.M.

Tonight, police discover a skeleton in the woods near the spot where Kyle (Matt Dallas) originally appeared. 8 P.M. (Military) BEST RANGER 2006 -- Think you're tough, do you? Army Rangers are active duty military personnel who might be called into service at any time, so they're tough and they're ready. This competition pits the best of the best against one another to determine the top twoman Ranger team in the country. The battle, though, is so grueling that only 15 of the 26 teams competing at Fort Benning, Ga., were able to finish. 9 P.M. (Animal Planet) CAUGHT IN THE MOMENT -- In this series premiere, Tristan Bayer and Vanessa Garnick, childhood sweethearts turned best friends, travel the globe in search of rare glimpses at unusual moments in the lives of animals; or just unusual animals. (Have you ever seen a spirit bear?) 10 P.M. (HGTV) HOUSE HUNTERS -- Star Jones Reynolds has left ''The View,'' but you can get your fix as she takes on hosting duties for a weeklong look at the intimidating and expensive New York City housing market. Real estate agents and buyers will give a crash course in the buying process and the real deal on some of the city's hottest neighborhoods. 10 P.M. (13) HOW ART MADE THE WORLD -- In ''The Art of Persuasion,'' the third episode of this five-part series, the host Dr. Nigel Spivey (left) shows us how historical figures have used images to persuade, influence and manipulate others.

Reports of the death toll ranged from less than a dozen to more than 40. Later a bomb in a Shiite mosque in another Baghdad neighborhood killed at least 19 people and wounded 59. A1 U.S. Stresses Talks with Korea The top American negotiator with North Korea, Christopher R.

Wolfowitz, left, president of the World Bank, has called on President Bush and other world leaders to make further compromises to revive the faltering global trade talks that are at an impasse over the issue of farm subsidies.

A9 NATIONAL A11-15 Republican Gives Details Of Intelligence Withheld Peter Hoekstra, left, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the Bush administration briefed the panel on a ''significant'' intelligence program only after a government whistle-blower alerted him to its existence and he pressed Mr. Bush for details. A11 Court's Decision Divides G.O.P. The Supreme Court decision striking down the use of military commissions to bring terrorism detainees to trial has set off sharp differences among Republicans in Congress over what kind of rights detainees should be granted and how much deference should be shown the president in deciding the issue.

2006-07-10T00:00:00Z,"A six-month stretch of political fund-raising will end tomorrow for New York candidates, and the results, by all accounts, will be stark: Republicans are struggling, and in some cases competing with one another for cash. The race for governor should yield a particularly sharp contrast, according to advisers to the two leading candidates. The Democrat, Eliot Spitzer, has about $15 million on hand, his allies say, and that is after spending $10 million on advertising already.

2006-07-11T00:00:00Z,"FLIGHTS ARE PACKED -- If you haven't made summer travel plans yet, you could be out of luck. The summer travel season has started with airlines reporting record load factors, or the percentage of seats filled with paying customers. Here are the figures for June from the top six airlines: The load factor at United Airlines was 88.3 percent, the highest ever. The load factor at Delta Air Lines was 84.6 percent, largely driven by a 30.6 percent increase in international passengers over June 2005; on June 30, Delta's flights were 94.4 percent full -- the highest daily load factor ever, the airline said. The June load factor at US Airways was 84.3 percent, and at Northwest Airlines, it was 89.7 percent, also the highest ever. At Continental Airlines, the June figure was 84.8 percent. But at Southwest Airlines, by comparison, the load factor was a relatively roomy 73.8 percent. Meanwhile, flight delays are mounting. The 20 top domestic carriers achieved an overall on-time arrival rate of 78.3 percent in May, compared with 83.7 percent in May 2005, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of the Transportation Department. At the same time, airlines have fewer employees to handle increased business. In April, domestic airlines employed 4.8 percent fewer workers than in April 2005; that means April 2006 was the 16th consecutive month that the work force was lower than in the year-ago month, the bureau said. LESS ROOM, MORE MONEY AT THE INN -- Hotel rooms are going to be harder to find and they are going to cost more this summer than last, according to PKF Hospitality Research, which says domestic hotel occupancy rates are likely to average nearly 74.1 percent, the highest level since 1997. Room rates are forecast to be up 6 percent over last summer. And forget about just dropping in unexpectedly. ''It will be tough to find a hotel room during the summer of 2006 without booking in advance,'' said R. Mark Woodworth, president of PKF Hospitality Research. TRANS-ATLANTIC BOOM -- With June load factors at 72 percent, the all-business-class carrier Eos Airlines said it was beginning a second daily flight in September from Kennedy International Airport to Stansted Airport in London. Eos, which began service last October, flies Boeing 757-200 aircraft, which typically hold 220 seats, configured with 48 premium lie-flat seats. Eos round-trip fares range from $2,950 for advance purchase to $6,500 walk-up (compared with more than $9,000 walk-up on major competitors). Reflecting the growing demand for New York-to-London service, British Airways said it was adding an eighth daily flight from Kennedy to Heathrow International Airport in December. British Air also has three daily flights serving Newark and Heathrow. BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE -- Many corporations are evidently returning to a policy that was sharply curtailed in the years after 9/11 -- allowing their traveling employees to tack a little time onto business trips for personal pleasure. According to the latest National Business Travel Monitor, 44 percent of business travelers now agree that they ''extend business trips for pleasure purposes'' whenever possible. That's up from 40 percent this time last year, according to YPB&R/Yankelovich, which publishes the monitor. NORTHWEST ELITE LANES -- Northwest has now joined several competitors and set aside special boarding lanes at departure gates for elite-status members of its WorldPerks frequent-flier program. The first-to-board lanes are also available to nonelite passengers with first class or World Business Class tickets, and to elite-status members of frequent flier programs of other airlines in the SkyTeam Alliance. COMPANION FLIERS -- Flying with a pet is, of course, infinitely more convenient on a private jet. Noting that many of its customers do take a pet along, NetJets, the leading fractional-share business jet company, has added a service giving domestic customers 24-hour telephone access for emergency or even general consultations with experts at the Matthew J. Ryan Veterinary Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania. NetJets said it flew nearly 10,000 pets on about 6,500 flights last year. Dogs and cats predominate, of course, but the pets have included a falcon, a wolf and a 250-pound kangaroo, said Maryann Aarseth, a NetJets spokeswoman. ONLINE HITS -- According to the online travel-data company Hitwise.com, these were the top 10 travel sites in May, ranked by the number of visits: MapQuest; Yahoo Maps; Expedia; Orbitz; Travelocity; Southwest Airlines; Cheap Tickets; Google Maps; Priceline; and Yahoo Travel. ET CETERA -- The most preferred hotel loyalty program in the world is Hilton HHonors, according to a survey of domestic and international travelers by Phoenix Marketing. But in the United States, Hilton HHonors shared the top-rated status with Marriott Rewards JetBlue just started more new routes: Burbank-Orlando, Fla.; Burbank-Las Vegas; and Boston-Buffalo, as well as routes from Pittsburgh to Kennedy International Airport and Pittsburgh to Boston. In September, JetBlue plans to start three new daily nonstops from Kennedy to Hobby Airport in Houston, with introductory one-way fares of $99. JOE SHARKEY"

Ms. Voigt, right, was dismissed in 2004 when the London opera house decided that given the director's choice of a black evening dress as a costume, someone slimmer would be more suitable in her signature role, Ariadne in Richard Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos.'' Subsequently Ms. Voigt, a soprano, underwent gastric bypass surgery and lost 135 pounds. Yesterday a Royal Opera spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity because the house does not officially announce casts so far in advance, said Ms. Voigt had a contract to return in the 2007-8 season. Her spokesman, Albert Imperato, said, ''She's very, very excited.'' Judge Orders Takeover Of Death Row Records A federal bankruptcy judge has ordered a takeover of Death Row Records in the latest round of legal proceedings surrounding the rap impresario Marion (Suge) Knight, below, The Associated Press reported. Saying that the label had suffered gross mismanagement, Judge Ellen Carroll ordered a bankruptcy trustee to step in. ''It seems apparent there is no one at the helm,'' she said. Mr. Knight was not present at the hearing in Los Angeles, and a message left for his lawyer was not immediately returned. In April, Mr. Knight filed for bankruptcy protection for himself and Death Row. He has claimed debts of more than $100 million. His bankruptcy petition was an outgrowth of the $107 million civil court judgment won last year by Lydia Harris, who said she had been cheated out of a 50 percent stake in the label, which represented Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur. Chris Daughtry Signs Recording Deal Chris Daughtry, below, a fan favorite though a fourth-place finisher this year in the fifth season of ''American Idol'' on Fox, has signed with 19 Recordings/RCA Records. An announcement said Mr. Daughtry had formed a band and begun to work with collaborators to record songs written by him and others. Release of his album is expected later this year. The same label recently signed Katharine McPhee, who lost out to Taylor Hicks in the ''American Idol'' finale. First McCartney Guitar To Be Sold at Auction A Rex acoustic guitar on which Paul McCartney learned his first chords is expected to fetch more than $185,000 when it is auctioned at Abbey Road Studios in London on July 28, the BBC reported. The instrument was owned by Sir Paul's Liverpool friend and schoolmate Ian James, now 64, who is selling it to help finance his retirement. The guitar, to be sold at a Cooper Owen's Music Legends auction, is accompanied by a letter of authenticity from Sir Paul saying, ''The above guitar belonging to my old school pal Ian James was the first guitar I ever held.'' In ''The Beatles,'' a biography by Hunter Davies, Sir Paul describes playing the guitar when he persuaded John Lennon, who was 16 and appearing with the Quarrymen at an event at a church in Liverpool, to let him join the band. The lot includes a photograph of Sir Paul playing it in his office this year. Appeal Is Planned In 'Da Vinci Code' Case Court officials say two historians who lost a plagiarism case against the British publishers of Dan Brown's best seller ''The Da Vinci Code'' plan to appeal the verdict, Reuters reported. The officials said the appeal could take place later this year, but no specific date has been set. Random House U.K., which won the copyright case earlier this year at the High Court in London, expressed disappointment at the decision by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, two of the three authors of ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail,'' to appeal. ''We have the utmost respect for the British legal system and acknowledge Baigent and Leigh's right to appeal the ruling,'' a Random House spokesman said. ''We regret, however, that more time and money is being spent trying to establish a case that was so comprehensively defeated in the High Court.'' No 'Pirates' Treasure In China Movie Theaters At least for now, not much gold (or yuan) will be spilling out of ''Dead Man's Chest'' in China. State news media said yesterday that scenes of cannibalism in the latest installment of ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' have prompted China's censors to keep the hit film out of theaters, Agence France-Presse reported. The Shanghai Daily reported that the censors reached their decision after watching frames showing people eating human flesh. ''The movie didn't get the approval from the state authority,'' the newspaper was told by an official of Shanghai United Cinema Lines, a theater chain. China does not have a movie-rating system, but the government will often suggest cutting scenes of violence or sex before permitting distribution. Ancient Greek Find Greek archaeologists have reported finding the ''intact and richly adorned'' torso of a statue of the goddess Artemis, right, that dates to the first century B.C., Agence France-Presse reported.

But the Free Aceh Movement, which fought for independence for nearly three decades and signed the peace accord last year, said the new law fell short of its demands, and of the provisions in the accord. ''The authority for the government in Aceh is not clear -- it says in the bill that the law in Aceh has to follow Indonesian law,'' said Bakhtiar Abdullah, above, a spokesman for the movement. ''If everything has to be in with the Indonesian standard, where's the new law?'' A key to the settlement, negotiated between the sides by Martti Ahtisaari, a former president of Finland, was an understanding by the rebels that a new provincial government in Aceh would have far wider authority than in the past. The passage of the law, four months later than stipulated in the peace accord, paves the way for elections later in the year. JANE PERLEZ (NYT)"

A1 New York's Violent Divorces The epic East 62nd Street divorce battle that apparently culminated in the explosion of a town house was bad by any standard. But in New York, divorce lawyers say they have seen comparable acts. Some say such spiraling levels of anger, rage and eventually violence are a function of New York's cumbersome divorce laws. B1 Officers Said to Aid Dealers Five police officers and one retired county sheriff's officer from several towns in Passaic County, New Jersey, were indicted on charges that they conspired to help twin brothers avoid arrest on drug charges and hide their close social relationships with the two men.

2006-07-12T00:00:00Z,"WE'D call it tomato soup with bread, but in some impoverished regions of Italy, where bread was daily fare and tomatoes not always available, it was pappa al pomodoro -- ''pap,'' or mush, with tomatoes. At its most meager, it would have been stale bread, soaked in water, with whatever tomatoes and seasonings could be gathered to augment it. It's still not exactly a luxury dish, but it's become the kind of thing Italian restaurants trot out when they want to show off their authenticity. It's something you can trot out to take advantage of the beginning of tomato-and-basil season. Looked at carefully, it's quite familiar -- fresh tomato sauce over bread instead of pasta -- but the eating experience is completely different. (It's good at room temperature, which is how it is sometimes served in Italy, and it's not even bad cold, like a thick gazpacho.)"

Gair, in order to sustain herself and her family, and, at the same time attended high school in the evenings. She earned her high school diploma from the George Washington Evening High School. She continued her education at Washington Square College, at night, earning her Bachelors Degree in 1938. Harriet went on to New York University School of Law, after her marriage to Harry A. Gair, dean of the negligence bar. She received her LLB from the law school in 1940 and was thereafter admitted to the Bar of the State of New York. In 1945 she became a partner in the law firm of Harry A. Gair, which was thereafter known as Gair and Gair. Harriet was in full charge of the management of the firm while her husband continued to achieve eminence in the field of trial practice. The firm continues to the present as Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman & Mackauf. Even with the burdens of major law office partnership, Harriet was a worthy President of the New York Womens Bar Association; President of the Putnam Valley Free Library Board of Trustees; President of the Mid-Hudson Library System; a member of the Town Board of Putnam Valley, and a Town Justice of the Town of Putnam Valley from 1976 to 1981, having been elected to that post by popular acclaim. Her guidance, wisdom and compassion will be missed by her family and all who knew her. Wife of the late Harry A. Gair, Harriet is survived by sons Anthony and Roger, stepsons Donald and Ellwood, and stepdaughter Barbara Schieber. She is also survived by 30 grandchildren and great grandchildren, including Daniel A. Gair, a New York lawyer at Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman & Mackauf.The funeral service will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 331 Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street, telephone number (212) 362-6600, on Thursday, July 13, 2006 at 1:15 pm. In lieu of flowers, donations to the New York University School of Law would be appreciated. $(6$)GAIR--Harriet E. The partners, associates, and entire staff deeply mourn the loss of the beloved co-founder of our firm, Harriet E. Gair. For all of her 100 years, she embodied the best of everything. She began working at the firm at the age of 15, and when she received her law degree from NYU 66 years ago, she was one of the first women to do so. For most of her life, she was our managing partner, but more importantly, she touched and inspired each of our personal lives. The legal profession has lost one of its pioneers and giants, but we have lost our leader and our friend. We extend our profound sympathies to her entire family and especially to her son and our partner, Anthony Gair, and to her grandson and our associate, Daniel Gair.

The defendant, John Nevarez, 53, of Manhattan, was indicted on Monday on charges of grand larceny and criminal impersonation. Prosecutors say he accepted money from immigrants and then, unknown to them, used fraudulent documents to apply for green cards on their behalf.

2006-07-13T00:00:00Z,"The far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen is headed to court for injudicious comments he made last year about the Nazis' wartime activities in France. The trial will decide whether he is guilty of ''complicity in contesting crimes against humanity and complicity in justifying war crimes'' by telling a right-wing weekly magazine last year that ''in France, at least, the German occupation was not particularly inhumane, although there were some blunders, inevitable in a country of 550,000 square kilometers.'' Mr. Le Pen has been fined twice for dismissing the Holocaust as a ''detail'' of history. Denying the Holocaust is a crime in France, punishable by fines or prison. CRAIG S. SMITH (NYT)"

2006-07-14T00:00:00Z,"WHO -- Susan Burrows, 69, a retired teacher, and her husband, Jack Burrows, 74, a retired Navy commander, who live in Virginia Beach. WHAT -- 2-bedroom cabin WHERE -- Roxbury, N.Y. This cabin was built in 1941 on property that has been in my family since 1893. When my grandfather built it, he rolled my grandmother's grand piano inside before the fourth wall went up. It's still here. After my grandfather died in 1922, my father hired a family to live on the dairy farm that was part of the property. For my whole life, the day after school closed we'd come up from the suburbs of Philadelphia and share the farmhouse with the family who lived there. At the time, this cabin was one room. We'd use it on weekends as a getaway from the farmhouse. We've added on to it since then."
2006-07-14T00:00:00Z,"Reggae Concert Canceled Protests have led to the cancellation of a reggae concert scheduled for Tuesday at Webster Hall. The event, intended to raise awareness of H.I.V. and AIDS, was to have featured Beenie Man, right, and the group T.O.K., who, protesters complained, are antigay, The Associated Press reported. The protesters flooded the organizer, LIFEbeat, a nonprofit group, with calls demanding that the acts be dropped from the lineup or that they publicly denounce antigay lyrics. A LIFEbeat board member, Tom Rosta, said the depth of feeling on the subject had been misjudged, and John Canelli, the organization's executive director, said some calls had been so threatening that safety at the concert became an issue. Shelley Poem Found A 172-line poem written by Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1811 has been rediscovered, the BBC reported. The poem, carrying an antiwar message, was printed in an 18-page pamphlet, ''Poetical Essay on the Existing State of Things,'' and attributed only to ''a Gentleman of the University of Oxford.'' The so-called poetical essay was published to raise money for the radical Irish journalist Peter Finnerty, who was in prison for libel. It was never republished, and some experts had doubted its existence. But Richard Linenthal, a director of the antiquarian bookseller Bernard Quaritch Ltd. of London, said the book had been brought by another bookseller for verification, and the poem's existence was discovered in an Internet search. Mr. Linenthal characterized the find as ''a discovery one dreams of making,'' and said the poem would be offered for sale. ''We cannot comment on its commercial value,'' he said. First Folio Fetches Millions A copy of Shakespeare's First Folio in mint condition was sold yesterday for $5.2 million at auction at Sotheby's in London, Reuters reported. The volume, published in 1623, seven years after Shakespeare's death, includes 36 plays, 18 of them not previously printed. The sale price was below the top estimate, $6.4 million. The volume had been in the Dr. Williams Library, a research institution for English Protestant dissent, since about 1716. Sotheby's said the buyer was a ''London book dealer,'' Agence France-Presse reported. Prison Sentences Sought In Croesus Theft A prosecutor in Turkey yesterday demanded prison sentences for the director of a state museum and nine others suspected in the theft of at least two objects from the treasure of King Croesus, The Associated Press reported. The prosecutor, Mustafa Celebi, asked that Kazim Akbiyikoglu, the director of the Archaeological Museum in Usak, in western Turkey, and seven other suspects receive as much as 25 years in prison in connection with the theft of a coin and a gold brooch in the shape of a winged sea horse, above. They were taken from the museum and replaced with fakes. Two other suspects, including a police officer, face sentences as long as four years for failing to investigate the theft, the indictment said. The collection was returned to Turkey by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1993 after a prolonged legal battle. Surgery for Gandolfini Delays 'Sopranos' Finale Fans of ''The Sopranos'' are going to have to wait even longer for the final eight episodes, Reuters reported. Chris Albrecht, the chairman and chief executive of HBO, said surgery to correct an old injury to the knee of James Gandolfini, above, who stars as the gangland boss Tony Soprano, led to a delay in production that would push the premiere from the previously announced Jan. 7 to as late as March. Angelina Jolie Is to Star As Journalist's Widow In a movie to be produced by her companion, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, right, will star as Mariane Pearl, the wife of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was kidnapped in Pakistan in 2002 and beheaded, The Associated Press reported. The film, to be directed by Michael Winterbottom, will be adapted from Mrs. Pearl's book, ''A Mighty Heart: The Brave Life and Death of My Husband Danny Pearl.'' The film will be a production of Revolution Films and Plan B, founded and owned by Mr. Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. After a seven-year relationship, including five years of marriage, they were divorced last year, after he and Ms. Jolie made ''Mr. & Mrs. Smith'' together. Dates for the start and release were not announced. Footnotes Bruce Springsteen and his Seeger Sessions band will tour Europe in the fall to promote their album, ''We Shall Overcome'' (Columbia). The tour is to begin on Oct. 1 in Bologna, Italy, and end on Nov. 21 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Billboard reported. The Brave New World Repertory Theater, which staged ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' on the front porches of Ditmas Park Street in Brooklyn last summer, will present a concert production of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Howard Sackler play ''The Great White Hope'' at 8 p.m. on Thursday at the Prospect Park Bandshell. The multimedia production will include live music by the ragtime pianist Roy Eaton as it tells the story of the heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. The Public Theater announced that Kevin Kline would be taking the place of Christopher Walken in the Shakespeare in the Park production of ''Mother Courage and Her Children,'' which starts performances on Aug. 8."

2006-07-14T00:00:00Z,"The Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden at the Museum of Modern Art is an apt environment for the music of the saxophonist Steve Coleman. It's an unenclosed space, subject to the whims of nature. Yet its expanse of marble -- accented with foliage, reflecting pools and, of course, the occasional Picasso or Miró -- feels precisely and thoughtfully designed. Mr. Coleman, above, has long been the principal architect of a similarly calibrated sort of avant-garde music. He formed the band Five Elements more than 20 years ago, establishing a signature ensemble that would come to feature a small group of musicians and a wide array of influences, from angular electric funk and interactive computer programming to ancient Egyptian numerology and the indigenous cultures of Africa, India and Cuba. (The group's latest album, ''Weaving Symbolics,'' has been released in Europe on Label Bleu and should surface here within the next few months.) Certain things about the group have remained constant over the years: internal polyphony, a multilayered sense of rhythm and the bladelike articulation of Mr. Coleman's alto saxophone. For the MoMA appearance -- which will feature Jonathan Finlayson on trumpet, Tim Albright on trombone, Jen Shyu on vocals, Thomas Morgan on bass and Justin Brown on drums -- Mr. Coleman has composed new work. ''Recently, I have been working on compositions that deal with the concept of unity through duality, a principle that I perceive in Nature,'' he wrote in an artist statement. ''The object is to generate through musical forms the fluctuating tensions that exist naturally in the universe.''

2006-07-14T00:00:00Z,"Explosions rocked two oil installations owned by the Italian oil company Agip in Nigeria's volatile Niger Delta region. In a separate attack there, militants killed four soldiers guarding oil workers, authorities in Nigeria said. The violence is apparently the latest in a series of attacks by militants in the region seeking a greater share of the nation's oil wealth for the region that produces it. The Niger Delta is one of the poorest and least developed parts of Nigeria, the world's ninth biggest oil producer. These attacks have reduced production in Nigeria by 25 percent. Agip's parent company ENI said in a statement that at least one pipeline had been damaged, but it did not provide details about the extent or nature of the attack. A militant group calling itself the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks in the region, but it has yet to say if it is responsible for the latest round.

2006-07-14T00:00:00Z,"Diner's Guide presents excerpts from recent restaurant reviews. Craftsteak Forget the omnivore's dilemma. Craftsteak presides over the carnivore's discombobulation. You can have grass-fed or corn-fed beef, beef from Hawaii or Australia, a New York strip aged 28 or 35 or 42 or 49 days. But apart from the Wagyu beef, the steaks -- none grilled or broiled, all roasted -- proved disappointing. Edit them out of the equation and the menu is still plenty long and articulated, including a great many delights. A dramatic, comfortable dining room, extensive raw bar and solid wine list are additional compensations. 85 10th Avenue, at 15th Street, Chelsea; (212) 400-6699. Entrees, $29 to $66, not counting Wagyu beef steaks. * [Rating: One Star] Mr. Chow Tribeca Mr. Chow Tribeca opened more than a quarter-century after the Mr. Chow on East 57th Street, but stays true to its predecessor's formula: a mixture of familiar and less familiar Chinese food in a slick setting with formally attired servers and an aura of clubby exclusivity. It can be amusing, and a few dishes, like the Peking duck, were terrific. But paying exorbitant prices for appetizers and main courses that don't improve significantly on cheaper analogues around town doesn't ultimately make much sense. And the servers all seem to have cash registers in their eyes. 121 Hudson Street, at North Moore Street, TriBeCa; (212) 965-9500. Entrees, $26 to $36. Satisfactory. Parea While some restaurants that promise updated, upscale takes on Greek food deliver moussaka in souped-up settings, Parea comes through with dips and sauces that put yogurt and feta to modulated, subtle, inventive use: nuggets of lamb's brain atop a tangle of frisée; a branzino roasted in grape leaves and accompanied by sweet onions instead of salty capers; and more. It's a serious effort by a sophisticated chef (Michael Symon, a culinary superstar in Cleveland), but the setting -- sleek and sexy, with a halo of orange light that evokes sunset at Delphi -- isn't disregarded. 36 East 20th Street; (212) 777-8448. Mezedes (small plates) and larger appetizers, $7 to $15. Entrees, $21 to $29. ** [Rating: Two Stars] Degustation Jewel Bako One of the many progeny of Jewel Bako, Degustation is actually contiguous to it, a 16-seat, U-shaped counter wrapping around an open kitchen. The intimate arrangement works, primarily because most of the modestly portioned dishes, which use Spanish new-wave flourishes and recall tapas, are wonderful . Open since 2001, Jewel Bako itself still has an impressive array of sushi and sashimi, some of it very fine. But a crowded field of competitors has raised the sushi bar. The restaurants share an address and phone: 239 East Fifth Street, East Village; (212) 979-1012. Degustation: small plates, $4 to $16. Five-course tasting menu, $50. ** [Rating: Two Stars] Jewel Bako: Individual pieces of sushi and sashimi, $3.50 to $12. * [Rating: One Star] What the stars mean: (None) Poor to satisfactory; * Good; ** Very good; *** Excellent; **** Extraordinary."

2006-07-14T00:00:00Z,"LONG BEACH ISLAND engenders a certain esprit de corps. Nearly two dozen communities share this 18-mile-long spit of sand, and its thousands of houses span a range including a beach compound now for sale for $9 million in the Loveladies area and a 268-square-foot condo listed at $219,000 in hustling, bustling Brighton Beach. But from Barnegat Light on the northern end through a long string of tiny towns to Beach Haven Inlet at the southern tip, car window stickers proclaim ''LBI'' -- or ''Exit 63,'' for the Garden State Parkway turnoff toward the island. The ocean inspires a communal love. Because the island is about half a mile wide, everyone is close to both the east side, where the Atlantic rumbles onto beaches, and the west, with its deep-water bay and lagoons. And everyone also shares in something else. The Route 72 causeway over Manahawkin Bay, is the only route in from the New Jersey mainland and, especially on summer weekends when rentals turn over, traffic jams are the common lot."
