1988-03-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: While it is true that some women choose repeat Caesarean birth out of ignorance [ Long Island Journal, Jan. 24 ] , from my own experience I believe it is more common that women are not told by their physicians that vaginal delivery after Caesarean birth is feasible."
1988-03-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Private security agencies, which provide guards, security systems and investigators for industrial and individual use, have become big business in India because of growing wealth, greater business competition and the fear of terrorism in the Punjab."

1988-03-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Blanche Du Bois first appeared to Tennessee Williams as an image: a woman sitting in a chair in the moonlight, waiting for a man to show up. Though she grew to be the heroine of ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' she never stopped waiting for men to save her."

1988-03-06T00:00:00Z,LEAD: It is difficult to judge the Olympics because of the determined interference of the television coverage. We seemed to see far more of ABC's commentators than the Olympic events. Is there no way to shut these people up? CLARENCE FISHER Jr. New York

The orchestra -about 20 strong - came to New York Thursday night with a concert at the Metropolitan"
1988-03-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: PAPRIKA is to the entrees and main dishes of Hungary what whipped cream is to its desserts and pastries: it is theoretically possible to do without, but on the evidence of many a meal in homes and restaurants, the dominant hue of the first and second courses is rosy more often than not, and what follows is likely to be hiding under a billow of white."
1988-03-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The annual Southern Ocean Racing Conference is having its second lean year in a row. Last year, organizers for the yacht-racing series off the Florida coast blamed the America's Cup in Australia for a poor turnout. This year, they cite the stock market crash last October."

1988-03-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The decision to submit ''A Brother's Dreams'' to your magazine was not an easy one for me to make.

1988-03-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: It is not often in first youth that people fall in love with Dutch 17th-century landscape painting. At 18 or 20, we prefer wilder shores and a more ecstatic mode of expression. Rare is the young person who would pass up a Provencal landscape by van Gogh or a Fauve harbor scene by Matisse or Derain in favor of rutted flatlands, blasted trees and tumbledown cottages by painters whose names we cannot pronounce, let along remember."

1988-03-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: SALLY GROSS has labored long and persuasively in dance, but she is surprisingly little known among dancegoers.

1988-03-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: On Wall Street, data-watching was always a favorite sport among economists, but not as much as it is today.

1988-03-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: IT is ironic that as the State Department is reporting that, with the exception of Greece, dining out in Portugal is less expensive than anywhere in Western Europe, dining at Stamford's new Portuguese restaurant, Pearl of the Atlantic, is one of the more expensive experiences in Fairfield County."

Maple, on the other hand, produces a more dynamic state of mind. A man named Herman, who presumably contributed these observations (which are presented by two unseen narrators), learned to make fires when he worked at a mental institution. Later, once the patients were liquidated, it became a school for German officers during the days of the Third Reich. Herman was so sensitive to the nuances of firewood, and so adroit at making fires to suit particular personalities, that he came to hold a privileged position within the ranks of the regime; he eventually rose to the honor of building fires for the Fuhrer himself. Hitler was a maple man."

1988-03-27T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Don Bredes's disappointment must be painful (About Men: ''Rights and Choices,'' Feb. 21.) But he makes it hard for us to sympathize with him. He writes of injustice and a man's rights, rather than telling the story of a risky human adventure that failed for very understandable reasons.

1988-03-27T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: IT was one of those moments that instantly made clear why we'd flown all the way down to the tip of Baja California to go bicycle riding.

1988-03-27T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: DORIS LILLY answered her telephone recently and was, as she put it, ''paralyzed with disbelief.'' A disembodied voice announced that it was the billing department of a major hospital, requested that she hold the line and assured her that a representative would be with her in a minute. She's almost certain the pronouncement was followed by music, but she wouldn't swear to it because she was still in a small state of shock about being called by a message machine."

1988-03-27T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The 50-odd piano pieces that Mendelssohn called ''Songs Without Words'' have been largely forgotten.

I don't think I ever heard him say he worked ''for'' Filene's. There was a spirit of identification - a sense of family, to risk sounding maudlin - that the store's employees seemed to share."
