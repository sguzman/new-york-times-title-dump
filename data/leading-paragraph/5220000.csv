1987-11-08T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: EVERY NOW AND THEN THE DRAMATIST Hugh Whitemore and the actor Derek Jacobi would meet for lunch and ruefully wonder if they weren't jointly launched on an impossible project. ''Breaking the Code'' just didn't seem writable, and its protagonist, the British mathematician and inventor Alan Turing, just didn't seem performable."
1987-11-08T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: PRESIDENT Reagan's reconstructed tax system is intact; he has won his big budgets for the Pentagon, although they are subject to raid; all his inveighing against other Government spending has paid off in the sense that even liberal Democrats advocate restraint. Last week, West Germany buckled to American pressure and cut interest rates, helping American banks to cut theirs."

1987-11-08T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: IT was my examination for the draft in 1940 that saved my life - just as that ceremony led to the opposite outcome for so many of my generation. My chest X-ray revealed advanced tuberculosis, and the news that there were to be more germs than Germans in my future. Being infected in both lungs I was considered unlikely to recover -a bit of trivia not revealed to me at the time."

1987-11-08T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: If THE BLACK DAHLIA by James Ellroy (Mysterious Press, $16.95) were a play, it would be reviewed as overwritten, overdirected, overproduced and overwrought. It is a big, sprawling novel about the relationship of two cops - Bucky Bleichert and Lee Blanchard -in the 1940's. Both were highly regarded professional boxers before entering the Los Angeles Police Department."

Annemarie Colbin, who runs a cooking school in New York that specializes in natural foods, has put together a video on grains and beans that is stunningly complete.

''Tai-Pan,'' a misguided film epic set in the early 19th century, attempts to recount British maneuverings in the China trade and the seizure of Hong Kong.
