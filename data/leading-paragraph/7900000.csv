A graduate of both Brooklyn Law School and Harvard Law School, Al began his teaching career in the early 1950s after nine years as an attorney with the SEC. He joined our faculty as a visiting professor in 1962. After receiving a standing ovation from students at the end of his first lecture, he was quickly offered a permanent position. Known for his sense of humor, fairness, and inquisitive nature, Al had a talent for shedding light on dry and complex legal concepts. His colleagues and students continuously marveled at his enthusiastic and compelling teaching style during his nearly 30 years at the Law School. As a scholar, his opinion was widely sought, and he could often be found in the company of other Columbia Law School intellectual giants, including Professors Hans Smit and Kenny Jones. Al was a generous mentor and teacher to generations of Columbia Law School students. In retirement, Al remained a voracious reader and history buff, and he enjoyed baking bread. Our hearts go out to his loving wife, Dorothy, to his daughter and son-in-law, Amelia Hill-Oliva and Cesar Oliva, and to his two grandsons, Michael Hill-Oliva and Kevin Hill-Oliva.

An attorney by training, he went on to an illustrious business career in which he held leadership positions in a broad range of industries-- entertainment (Loews Corporation), food (United Brands), and finance (Oppenheimer & Co.)--before becoming founder and chair, and later chair emeritus, of Centre Partners Management, a leading private equity firm. Energetic, forward-thinking, and a true leader, Lester was a philanthropic supporter of many institutions, but he was especially devoted to his beloved alma mater, to which he gave unstintingly of his time and resources. A major supporter of the NYU School of Law, he will be especially remembered for his generous support of the Lester Pollack Center for Law and Business, a joint venture of the law school and the NYU Stern School of Business that-- through his foresight and generosity--is a leader in its field. He served for nearly three decades as a Trustee and, later, as a Life Trustee of NYU, and at the time of his passing was Chair Emeritus of the NYU Law Board of Trustees. Among the many honors bestowed upon him by NYU was the prestigious annual Albert Gallatin Medal, recognizing his outstanding contributions to society. He will be sorely missed. On this sad day, our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Geraldine ""Geri"" Pollack; his children, Bruce Pollack and Wendy Isaacs; his grandchildren; and all of his loved ones and friends.

The family thanks the community of caregivers and friends who encircled her with love, companionship, laughter and music since 2008: Diane F., Keavy B., Joni F., Elizabeth M., Gaye P., Peggy O., Lolly S., Anne C., Julia H., Jackie H., Mandy L., Mary S., Carol P., Brian C., Becky R., David H., Harold H., Terry B., and Gregg B. Born in Beckley, West Virginia on March 14, 1924, she was the daughter of Dr. John H. McCulloch and Effie Lajo Stalnaker. After graduating from the University of Kentucky fate ushered her through the doors of Beckley's WJLS radio station in 1947 where, as ""Side-Saddle Sue,"" she hosted a weekly radio program. She played banjo and ukulele, singing cowboy music, reading local news and engaging in easy humor. A year or so later she departed for New York City, where she pursued a career in musical theater. She sang cabaret, stage managed many productions including ""Oh, Captain!"" and was a principal in the summer traveling company of 'Brigadoon.' In 1951, she and a business partner, the director George Quick, renovated several old stables and barns on the Vanderbilt Estate in Hyde Park, NY, establishing the Hyde Park Playhouse. While in Hyde Park she also assisted the late Eleanor Roosevelt with the NY State Literacy Project. When theatrical success required a press agent, she and Quick hired a young writer, Hilary Masters. Polly and Hilary fell in love, married and ran the Playhouse for the next seven years. In 1960 they sold the Playhouse and moved to their new home on Woods Drive in Ancramdale, New York. From the mid-1960s she was very active in her community. She volunteered for the American Cancer Society, worked with the local PTA and was a friendly and welcoming face at the polls during election time. In 1968 she ran successfully for President of the Pine Plains Board of Education, becoming the first woman in local history to hold that honour. She held that post until 1975 and was, among many other things, instrumental in the conception and building of the Stissing Mountain Junior-Senior High School, also the first of its kind in the region. From 1979 until the mid-1990s she contributed a regular column for a local newspaper, the Roe-Jan Independent, under the heading ""One Side to Everything."" She wrote about politics, local and national education, television, rural homeownership, the origins of linguistic memory and the diminutive interior dimensions of the original Ancramdale Post Office. She is pre-deceased by her brother, John H. McCulloch Jr., her parents and her former husband, Hilary Masters, whom she divorced in 1985. She is survived by her sister-in-law, Carolyn McCulloch of Beckley, WV, as well as her three children, Joellen Masters of Lexington, Massachusetts, Catherine Masters of Deer Isle, Maine, John D.C. Masters of Paros, Greece and a grand-child, Kaolin R.E. Pitcher of Portland, Maine. She was a mother, a grandmother, a prescient community leader, a lover of Broadway musicals and English mysteries, a fount of knowledge and a source of no- nonsense unending love and support to all. She covered the ground she walked on. The family will announce a memorial gathering at a later date. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to the Polly Masters Educational Fund for Young Women at Pine Plains Stissing Mountain High School. Services are under the direction of the Peck and Peck Funeral Home, Copake, NY. To send an online condolence, please visit peckandpeck.net. 1/3"

2015-12-11T00:00:00Z,"GRAY--Sherman, 97, died peacefully on December 2nd at his home at Princeton Windrows in Princeton, N.J. Known for his kind and gentlemanly manner, Mr. Gray was a member of a family of Scotch-Irish descent that arrived in New England in the early 1600's and later participated in the American Revolution and in Shay's Rebellion. Among his ancestors are Roger Sherman of Connecticut, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and General William Tecumseh Sherman. The son of Prentiss Nathaniel Gray and Laura Sherman Gray, Mr. Gray and his older sister Barbara grew up in Larchmont, NY and Salt Lake City, UT and vacationed in Jackson Hole, WY where the family owned the D- Triangle and G-Ray ranches. At a young age, he went on hunting trips and explored Alaska with his father and sister and climbed the Tetons with legendary mountaineers Glenn Exum and Paul Petzold. In the 1930's he and his father attempted a reintroduction of pronghorn antelope into the Jackson Hole area. Pronghorn calves were to be brought to the Hole and raised in captivity until old enough to be released into the wild. The plan hinged on the conversion of the Gray's large Packard sedan to a ""stock"" car by ripping out the back seats and padding the interior. The two of them collected a small posse of pronghorn calves from a ranchman hours away whom his father had convinced to capture newborns the previous spring. The ride home was chaotic. Ever resourceful, they built a much-needed cage for the back of their car for the second trip. There are now pronghorns in Jackson Hole; however, Mr. Gray did not believe that this is a result of their efforts though the whole enterprise was ""lots of fun and makes for a good story"". Mr. Gray attended the Malcolm Gordon School in Garrison, NY and then went on to St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and to college at Harvard. At Harvard he was on the varsity hockey team and was the captain of the 1941 varsity crew that went undefeated for the three years he rowed, winning a ""Clean Sweep"" over Yale and the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley, England. He was a member of the Delphic Club and the Hasty Pudding Club. After graduation, he married Barbara Bintz of Salt Lake City, UT. The marriage would last 72 years until her death last year. Mr. Gray was a Navy pilot during WWII, flying PBY- type aircraft on patrols around the Aleutian Islands in the northern Pacific. He participated in battles for Attu and Kiska islands, though he maintained that the fog and a persistent diet of cornflakes were his greatest challenges. After the war, Mr. Gray started his financial career with J. Henry Schroder Banking Corp. and later moved to Merrill Lynch where he established Merrill's first overseas offices in Geneva and London. He and his family made several moves overseas and back to their home in Sands Point, Long Island, NY- first to Switzerland and later to London where he spent much of his career and met many of his closest friends. Always an avid sportsman and conservationist, Mr. Gray was a long time member of the Boone and Crockett Club, the Angler's Club of NY, the North Woods Club and Parkside Angling Club. He was also a member of the Brook Club in NYC and the Nassau Club in Princeton. Following his father's relief efforts in Belgium during WWI, he became an avid supporter of the Belgian American Educational Foundation. Mr. Gray's wife Barbara B. Gray died in December 2014. He was also predeceased by his first daughter, Pamela Gray Martindale of Newport Beach, CA. and Jackson, WY.

West and Shapiro, had one of the longest friendships and business relationships in the history of Hollywood. The two boys from the Bronx had known each other since grammar school and then went on to work together for 41 years at personal management/production company Shapiro/West. ""I first met Howie in the schoolyard of Public School 80 in the Bronx when we were eight years old,"" Shapiro said. ""Howie was the new kid at school as he just moved from another Bronx neighborhood. Howie was alone in the schoolyard, sitting on a step near one of the school entrances. I invited him to join me and my friends to play basketball, stickball, curb ball, and touch football. It was love at first sight, and we became best friends since that day. We were partners in buying comic books, we bought our first car together, worked as busboys, and lifeguards/stagehands at the Tamiment summer resort in the Pocono Mountains, where he worked with writers Neil and Danny Simon, choreographer Herb Ross, comedian Dick Shawn, and singer Barbara Cook. It was a great beginning for our showbiz career."" (PS 80 in the Bronx is also the alma mater of Garry and Penny Marshall, Ralph Lauren (nee Ralph Lipschitz), Calvin Klein, and Robert Klein). After graduation from Long Island University and then serving in the Army, West reunited with Shapiro in the William Morris Agency mailroom, and it wasn't long before both began repping talent. West's clients at William Morris included Neil Diamond, Glen Campbell, Anne Murray, Ruth Buzzi, Paul Lynde, Jerry Reed and Greg Garrison (who produced/directed The Dean Martin Show and The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast). He specialized in television packaging, putting together such shows as The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour and The Bobby Darin Show. In 1974, he left the William Morris Agency to help form Shapiro/West. Shapiro recruited West by offering him the presidency of the firm and the parking space closest to the office entrance. West, who also then began repping Marty Feldman, executive produced the comedian's The Last Remake of Beau Geste, which he also developed with the comedy star. He also produced ""In God We Trust,"" which he and Feldman once again developed. In addition to Jerry Seinfeld, Carl Reiner, Peter Bonerz (who was an actor on Newhart before directing multiple episodes of Murphy Brown and Home Improvement), Shapiro/West's client roster included/includes Feldman, Andy Kaufman, director Alan Myerson, Gabe Kaplan, Robert Wuhl, Bill Persky and Sam Denoff (who produced The Dick Van Dyke Show with Reiner and created That Girl for Marlo Thomas), Dick Clair and Jenna McMahon (who wrote for Carol Burnett, created Mama's Family, Facts of Life and It's a Living), Ken Spears & Joe Ruby, Tom Tenowich and Ed Scharlach (""Mork & Mindy""), Sam Bobrick (the prolific playwright who also created NBC's Saved By The Bell and wrote for such classic comedy shows as Get Smart, The Andy Griffith Show, and The Dick Van Dyke Show), and writer Norman Barasch (""Send Me No Flowers"" on Broadway, TV shows ""Rhoda"", ""Benson"", ""Chico & The Man""), and Austin & Irma Kalish (writers for ""All In The Family"", ""Bob Newhart Show"", ""Maude"", etc.), Steve Gordon (writer/director of ""Arthur"" starring Dudley Moore. West also guided the successful career of Bill Lawrence who produced Spin City, Scrubs, Cougar Town. Lawrence's new series ""Undateable"" is in its third season on NBC and the one-hour series Rush Hour (based on the hit film) was picked up by CBS.

Neve is survived by Ann, his beloved and loving wife of 45 years, his three beloved children of whom he was so proud, Sarah-Jane, Megan and Truan, his brother, Robert and his daughter-in-law Claire. Neve was born in 1944 in Harrow, England and graduated from St Peter's College, Oxford University with BA and MA degrees in Modern History. He joined the advertising business in London during the ""swinging 60s""; he had his suits tailored in the original Carnaby Street. Neve met Ann at Garland- Compton Advertising in 1968; in 1970 they moved to New York City where they were married in 1972 and became U.S. citizens in 1983. For nearly 30 years Neve worked at various international advertising agencies including Compton Advertising, Saatchi-Compton, Cadwell Davis Savage (where Neve was a partner), Wells Rich Greene and Ogilvy & Mather, on some of the world's largest accounts: Procter & Gamble; Pan Am, Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, SmithKline Beecham and more. In 1994 Neve joined McCaw Cellular in Seattle which became AT&T Wireless. Thereafter, Neve was one of the original management team that helped build the successful online advertising start up AvenueA/aQuantive, ultimately bought by Microsoft in what, at the time, was their largest ever purchase. Neve spent the last 8 years of his business life as a Vice President at Netflix which he described as the best, most enjoyable and most rewarding job of his career. Neve retired in 2012. Neve was known for his distinguished beard, dry wit, vigorous debate and a treasure chest of bon-mots from which he often provided the appropriate word or comment to lighten, enlighten or end a discussion. Except at home where Ann's last word was always after Neve's--the true last word! Neve's eclectic loves and interests included his family, travel to over 50 countries, history, antique pewter, movies, hiking (he and Ann walked 192 miles across England in 2007), the state, history and people of Vermont where he had a second home for 35 years and where his ashes will be interred, news and newspapers, 50s-60s rock 'n roll, the English language (quotes; epigrams; idioms; cliches; aphorisms, rhyming slang), association football, cricket, rugby and British comedy. The satirical British magazine Private Eye could bring him to tears of laughter. Neve's few dislikes included being late, he or others (on one of Neve and Ann's first dates Neve had left when Ann arrived 10 minutes late though Ann quickly found him and they remained together for 47 timely years); capers and olives; opera, and theater seats that pushed his knees into his chest. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Neve's name to the Prostate Cancer Foundation. 1/3"

2015-12-13T00:00:00Z,"GRAY--Sherman, 97, died peacefully on December 2nd at his home at Princeton Windrows in Princeton, N.J. Known for his kind and gentlemanly manner, Mr. Gray was a member of a family of Scotch-Irish descent that arrived in New England in the early 1600's and later participated in the American Revolution and in Shay's Rebellion. Among his ancestors are Roger Sherman of Connecticut, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and General William Tecumseh Sherman. The son of Prentiss Nathaniel Gray and Laura Sherman Gray, Mr. Gray and his older sister Barbara grew up in Larchmont, NY and Salt Lake City, UT and vacationed in Jackson Hole, WY where the family owned the D- Triangle and G-Ray ranches. At a young age, he went on hunting trips and explored Alaska with his father and sister and climbed the Tetons with legendary mountaineers Glenn Exum and Paul Petzold. In the 1930's he and his father attempted a reintroduction of pronghorn antelope into the Jackson Hole area. Pronghorn calves were to be brought to the Hole and raised in captivity until old enough to be released into the wild. The plan hinged on the conversion of the Gray's large Packard sedan to a ""stock"" car by ripping out the back seats and padding the interior. The two of them collected a small posse of pronghorn calves from a ranchman hours away whom his father had convinced to capture newborns the previous spring. The ride home was chaotic. Ever resourceful, they built a much-needed cage for the back of their car for the second trip. There are now pronghorns in Jackson Hole; however, Mr. Gray did not believe that this is a result of their efforts though the whole enterprise was ""lots of fun and makes for a good story"". Mr. Gray attended the Malcolm Gordon School in Garrison, NY and then went on to St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and to college at Harvard. At Harvard he was on the varsity hockey team and was the captain of the 1941 varsity crew that went undefeated for the three years he rowed, winning a ""Clean Sweep"" over Yale and the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley, England. He was a member of the Delphic Club and the Hasty Pudding Club. After graduation, he married Barbara Bintz of Salt Lake City, UT. The marriage would last 72 years until her death last year. Mr. Gray was a Navy pilot during WWII, flying PBY- type aircraft on patrols around the Aleutian Islands in the northern Pacific. He participated in battles for Attu and Kiska islands, though he maintained that the fog and a persistent diet of cornflakes were his greatest challenges. After the war, Mr. Gray started his financial career with J. Henry Schroder Banking Corp. and later moved to Merrill Lynch where he established Merrill's first overseas offices in Geneva and London. He and his family made several moves overseas and back to their home in Sands Point, Long Island, NY- first to Switzerland and later to London where he spent much of his career and met many of his closest friends. Always an avid sportsman and conservationist, Mr. Gray was a long time member of the Boone and Crockett Club, the Angler's Club of NY, the North Woods Club and Parkside Angling Club. He was also a member of the Brook Club in NYC and the Nassau Club in Princeton. Following his father's relief efforts in Belgium during WWI, he became an avid supporter of the Belgian American Educational Foundation. Mr. Gray's wife Barbara B. Gray died in December 2014. He was also predeceased by his first daughter, Pamela Gray Martindale of Newport Beach, CA. and Jackson, WY. He is survived by his daughter, Elizabeth Gray Lilleston of Navesink, NJ, and his son, Prentiss Gray of Morristown, NJ; Elizabeth's three daughters: Jessica of Philadelphia, PA, Amanda of Bangor, ME, Pamela of Bethesda, MD, Pamela's son, Kai Noe, and Prentiss's three sons; Matthew, Zachary, and Nathaniel, all of Morristown, NJ. Beginning in his sophomore year in college, Mr. Gray became an enthusiastic lifetime participant in the longest- running in-depth study of adult development which has been featured in The Atlantic magazine. In accordance with Mr. Gray's wishes, in lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Harvard Study of Adult Development c/o Mass General Development Office, 125 Nashua Street, Suite 540, Boston MA 02114 or by calling (617) 643 -3879. 1/3"

Dr. Moriber--or Lou, as he was widely known, leaves an extraordinary personal and professional legacy: as a devoted husband to Frances Schneider Moriber, who died in 1997 after 56 years of joyful marriage; as proud father to son, Samuel Moriber of New York, and daughter, Lisa Miller of Virginia, grandfather to Jessica Miller of California and Seth Miller of Colorado; and great-grandfather to Kirya Miller, age 14, and Pip Miller, age 11, of Colorado. Born July 12, 1917 in Brooklyn, Lou had three brothers, Joseph, Maurice, and Edward, all deceased. Lou began his career as an aquatic physiologist at the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior, and then began a long and illustrious career at Brooklyn College, where he was well known as a remarkably caring and modest man of great intellect and heart. As professor of biology at Brooklyn College, he served for 35 years as teacher, mentor and as the Chair of the Biology Department, the Deputy Chair of the School of General Studies in Biology, and the Executive Officer for the Graduate Program in Biology at the City University of New York; and as a model of integrity and optimism to his colleagues, family and friends everywhere. In the course of his career Lou served as Pre- Med Advisor at Brooklyn College, where he was instrumental in advancing the careers of thousands of doctors. Passionate about education in the sciences even after his retirement, Lou joined his cousin, George Moriber, a chemistry professor at Brooklyn College, in creating a highly successful program to introduce science education to elementary and high school teachers. Lou was a thoughtful and heartwarming person to all who knew him.

2015-12-16T00:00:00Z,"VERNON--Lillian. The NYU Community deeply mourns the loss of our devoted friend, Life Trustee, and generous benefactor, Lillian Vernon. Lillian, who attended NYU's College of Arts and Science, was a pioneering businesswoman and entrepreneur whose inspiring life story and generous philanthropy touched countless lives. Born in Germany, she and her family fled the Nazis and rebuilt their lives in America. As a young wife and mother seeking to supplement her family's income, she placed an ad in Seventeen magazine offering purses with matching belts, and from the overwhelming response to that modest ad she built one of the most successful and admired mail-order companies in the history of American business, particularly notable for having a woman at its helm in a male- dominated business world. Possessed of boundless energy and determination, Lillian never forgot her humble beginnings and devoted much of her life to ""giving back"" through philanthropic support for charities and cultural and educational institutions. Prominent among these was NYU, where she energetically served on the Faculty of Arts and Science Board of Overseers, the School of Professional Studies Dean's Council, and, since 1997, the NYU Board of Trustees. She supported NYU's esteemed creative writing program through the establishment of the Lillian Vernon Professorship in Creative Writing and the Lillian Vernon Creative Writers House, helping to develop new generations of literary talent. We are saddened by her death, and our thoughts and prayers go out to her husband, Paolo Martino, her children -- David Hochberg, and Fred Hochberg, WSC '74, Fred's husband, Tom Healy, and all of her loved ones and friends. 1/3"

He is survived by his two children, Carol and Michael Tessel, their mother, Bonnie Tessel, and his life partner of 23 years, Sharon Kewley. He also has a newborn grandson, Charles. He was entombed in City of Boca Raton Mausoleum on Friday, December 11, 2015 with full military honors by the Air Force Honor Guard. Glick Family Funeral Home of Boca Raton oversaw the arrangements. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that a donation be made in his memory to The Callicoon Center Volunteer Fire Dept, General Delivery, Callicoon Center, NY 12724. Stanley was born in Brooklyn, NY on November 9, 1929 to Ann Selikoff and Abraham Tessel. Stanley graduated from Brooklyn Law School and was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1952, retiring from the New York State Bar in 2014, 62 years later. He was admitted to argue in front of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court in October 1952 and the United States Supreme Court in April 1957. Stanley joined the U.S. Air Force as a Judge Advocate and served through the remainder of the Korean War in Pusan. He earned the rank of Major, once state side he was stationed out of Stewart Air Base in Newberg, NY and continued to serve in the reserves until 1972. Throughout his life, he maintained a fierce pride in his military service and his country. Following his service, Stanley entered private law practice in New York City. He established his own firm with Bernard Turkewitz (Turkewitz & Tessel). Stanley later became a named partner at Kramer, Dilloff, Tessel, Duffy & Moore (now Kramer, Dilloff, Livingston & Moore). He specialized in personal injury law, with a focus on obstetrical medical malpractice. Stanley pioneered the successful litigation of medical malpractice suits involving babies born with brain damage due to medical negligence. In partnership with the Law Journal Seminars, a division of American Lawyer Media, Inc. he co-authored several versions of the book Diagnosis and Treatment of Fetal Distress with Stephen H. Mackauf, J.D., of Gair, Gair and Conason, they toured the country giving lectures in the 1990's on the subject. Bernard Nathenson, M.D., also spoke during these popular seminars. Stanley retired from full-time work and moved to South Florida in 1989. He continued to consult for his former firm, flying regularly from Florida to New York to depose witnesses before trial, along with giving the Law Journal Seminars. Notable cases Stanley did the depositions on were: Libby Zion http://www.washingtonpost. com/wp-dyn/content/article/ 2006/11/24/AR2006112400985. html. Stanley was a consummate gentleman, treating everyone with respect and dignity. Attorneys were amazed when their doctor clients would get up at the end of a deposition and shake Stanley's hand. It was said around the office that a Stanley Tessel deposition was like money in the bank. He also pursued his passion for travel, exploring all seven continents. He read the New York Times every morning and his Sundays were devoted to the crossword puzzles, the New York Giants and Chinese food. Throughout his life, he fondly collected carved wood art, rare coins and precious ceramics. Stanley will be remembered for his walking at a New York clip, endless generosity and winning smile. He provided all those he loved, particularly his children, with the resources to pursue meaningful educational and personal enrichment. Stanley's mottos on living a fulfilling life: Always have something to look forward to, keep planning and dreaming. And: Don't just live on this earth, go out and make a difference that you were here. Stanley made a difference. He will be sincerely missed. 1/3"

2015-12-18T00:00:00Z,"BAUMAN--Martin H.,died peacefully on December 16 at the age of 85. As President and Founder of Martin H. Bauman Associates, a prominent Executive Recruiting firm that was in business for 42 years, Martin had the reputation for bringing careful study and detailed analysis to every project he undertook. Research at NYU under Dr. Peter Drucker, the founder of modern management, showed that there was a poor correlation between the interview process and how candidates actually performed on the job. Martin became an executive recruiter and was the first person to develop an assessment process of potential candidates that not only included testing, but his own innovative self-concept method. After more than 40 years, the results were clear - over 96% of candidates placed by Martin H. Bauman Associates were still on the job after one year, while the industry average for recruiting firms was 67%. In 1992, Martin was inducted into the Executive Search Hall of Fame as one of the top recruiters in the U. S. Martin's competence and integrity brought him to the top of the industry, working with Presidents, Chairmen, and Managing Directors of companies that included Merrill Lynch, Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, AT&T, FedEx, Colgate-Palmolive, Revlon, and every major transportation company, including airlines, shipping and trucking firms. The son of Rose and Jack Bauman, Martin grew up in the Bronx, and attended New York University for all his studies. His graduate research, under Dr. Peter Drucker, focused on the Behavioral Sciences. Over the course of his career, Martin lectured at The New York University Management Institute and was an Associate Professor at Pace University. Courses taught included Advanced Management, Behavioral Sciences, Human Resources Management, and Interviewing. His speaking engagements included Fortune 500 companies and he published over 20 articles about executive search, management, and the interview process. Martin contracted polio in the Army in the 1950s at the age of 23, and attended college through the G.I. Bill. In 2000, he established the Martin H. Bauman Scholarship Fund for Handicapped Students at New York University. As a survivor of polio, he was intimately aware of the challenges that handicapped people face every day, and felt that an education was one of the most important goals that should be available to all. Martin impacted the lives of many, many people in his business life and in his personal life. Placing people in jobs was an art form that demanded an expertise in social and psychological behaviors. He always said that in addition to having the technical aspects for a job, you had to ""have the right fit on all levels."" He taught young employees by example. For the one year in the company's history that was not profitable, his employees voluntarily took a 10% cut in salary (so no one would have to be let go); Martin did not take a salary that year. Some ex-employees went on to form their own companies, and some are now Principals and Partners in firms. He was a good teacher and a man of integrity. Martin was preceded in death by his first wife, Carol. He is survived by his two children, John and Elizabeth, his sister, Thelma Greenstein, his wife, Sherry and her children, Christopher Connor and Laura Connor O'Sullivan, and his step-grandchildren, Thomas, Claire, and Maeve O'Sullivan. Donations can be made in Martin's name to his scholarship fund. Checks should be made out to New York University, noting the scholarship name in the memo area (Martin H. Bauman Scholarship Fund for Handicapped Students), and sent to NYU, Development & Alumni Relations, 44 West 4th Street, Suite 10-160, New York, NY 10012. Funeral Services will be held on December 18 at 9:30am at Nassau North Chapels, 55 N. Station Plaza, Great Neck, NY 11021. Burial will be at Beth Moses Cemetery, Wellwood Avenue, Farmingdale, NY 11735. The family will sit Shiva from 1pm until 4pm on Friday, December 18 at the Bauman home in Sands Point. 1/3"

Stanley graduated from Brooklyn Law School and was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1952, retiring from the New York State Bar in 2014, 62 years later. He was admitted to argue in front of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court in October 1952 and the United States Supreme Court in April 1957. Stanley joined the U.S. Air Force as a Judge Advocate and served through the remainder of the Korean War in Pusan. He earned the rank of Major, once state side he was stationed out of Stewart Air Base in Newberg, NY and continued to serve in the reserves until 1972. Throughout his life, he maintained a fierce pride in his military service and his country. Following his service, Stanley entered private law practice in New York City. He established his own firm with Bernard Turkewitz (Turkewitz & Tessel). Stanley later became a named partner at Kramer, Dilloff, Tessel, Duffy & Moore (now Kramer, Dilloff, Livingston & Moore). He specialized in personal injury law, with a focus on obstetrical medical malpractice. Stanley pioneered the successful litigation of medical malpractice suits involving babies born with brain damage due to medical negligence.

Mackauf, J.D., of Gair, Gair and Conason, they toured the country giving lectures in the 1990's on the subject. Bernard Nathenson, M.D., also spoke during these popular seminars. Stanley retired from full-time work and moved to South Florida in 1989. He continued to consult for his former firm, flying regularly from Florida to New York to depose witnesses before trial, along with giving the Law Journal Seminars. Notable cases Stanley did the depositions on were: Libby Zion http://www.washingtonpost. com/wp-dyn/content/article/ 2006/11/24/AR2006112400985. html. Stanley was a consummate gentleman, treating everyone with respect and dignity. Attorneys were amazed when their doctor clients would get up at the end of a deposition and shake Stanley's hand. It was said around the office that a Stanley Tessel deposition was like money in the bank. He also pursued his passion for travel, exploring all seven continents. He read the New York Times every morning and his Sundays were devoted to the crossword puzzles, the New York Giants and Chinese food. Throughout his life, he fondly collected carved wood art, rare coins and precious ceramics. Stanley will be remembered for his walking at a New York clip, endless generosity and winning smile. He provided all those he loved, particularly his children, with the resources to pursue meaningful educational and personal enrichment. Stanley's mottos on living a fulfilling life: Always have something to look forward to, keep planning and dreaming. And: Don't just live on this earth, go out and make a difference that you were here. Stanley made a difference. He will be sincerely missed. 1/3"

2015-12-22T00:00:00Z,"MASUR--Kurt. The New York Philharmonic deeply mourns the loss of our inspiring and dedicated Music Director Emeritus Kurt Masur (Music Director, 1991-2002). Maestro Masur's dedication to expressing humanism through music was most vivid in the wake of 9/11, when he led the Philharmonic in a moving performance of Brahms's Ein deutsches Requiem, and musicians from the Orchestra gave free chamber concerts around Ground Zero. Masur's Philharmonic tenure began earlier than expected, when he stepped in to conduct Mendelssohn's Elijah following the sudden death of Leonard Bernstein. Over the next 11 seasons, Masur hired 42 Philharmonic musicians; led the Orchestra on 17 tours around the world, traveling to 75 cities in 30 countries, including the first-ever Philharmonic concerts in mainland China; and expanded the Philharmonic's education programs. Highlights of his tenure included profound performances of oratorios by Bach and Mendelssohn, his predecessors as Kappelmeister of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on the U.N.'s 50th anniversary and the turn of the millennium; overseeing the four-season American Classics initiative; introducing a longstanding collaboration with Wynton Marsalis and Jazz at Lincoln Center; symphonic cycles of Brahms and Beethoven; and the commissions and premieres of 43 works, including the Messages for the Millennium. Masur presided over the Orchestra's return to the radio and the creation of its own recording label, principally to release performances preserved in the Archives, and he conducted 32 live concert recordings released on Teldec Classics. New Yorkers still experience Masur's humanist mark through the popular Annual Free Memorial Day Concert, which he introduced. From his 1981 debut until his last appearance in 2012, Maestro Masur led the Philharmonic in 909 performances. New York Philharmonic Music Director Alan Gilbert said: ""Kurt Masur's years at the New York Philharmonic represent one of its golden eras, in which music-making was infused with commitment and devotion -- with the belief in the power of music to bring humanity closer together. The ethical and moral dimensions that he brought to his conducting are still palpable in the musicians' playing, and I, along with the Philharmonic's audiences, have much to thank him for. I will always be grateful for the support he gave me starting long ago when I was a student. I will miss him deeply."" The funeral will be private and a public memorial will be planned for a later time. The New York Philharmonic family sends our sympathy and love to his wife, Tomoko, and their son, Ken-David and his wife, Melinda Lee; his daughters, Angelika and Carolin; his sons, Michael and Matthias; and his nine grandchildren. 1/3"

Her publishing jobs after college included work at Esquire, The Washington Post, Fortune, Time, and Newsweek. In 2006 Robin founded Social Media Today LLC, a business-to-business media company.

The WRC is an international nonprofit working to protect women and children displaced by conflict and crisis. Robin, who spent time in Uganda for the WRC, was particularly interested in women's reproductive health. At the time of her death the commission was beginning the process of naming her as one of its overseers. With then-husband, Robert James McDonald Carey, Robin raised two sons, Preston Fray Carey and James Duncan Carey, in Maplewood, NJ. In 2012, she married John Dudley Casey, novelist and University of Virginia professor of creative writing. Four stepdaughters Maud, Nell, Clare, and Julia Casey are among her survivors. Robin is also survived by her sister Mary (Molly) Fray Sanford of Syria, VA, and her brothers Jackson Lee Fray III of Culpeper, VA, and Preston Cocke Fray of Burbank, CA. Intelligent, lovely, and spirited, Robin will be greatly missed not only by her family, but also by her Social Media Today team, fellow humanitarians, and many friends.

For 25 years he served as president and CEO of Little, Brown and Company, the prestigious publishing house founded in Boston in 1837. Thornhill's college education at Princeton University was interrupted by World War II while he served nearly four years in the U.S. ground and air forces in the Pacific Theater before returning to Princeton and completing a degree in American history in 1946. Two years later he joined Little, Brown and Company as a trainee and worked in various sales and editorial departments. He was named general manager of the trade division in 1954, elected a vice president in 1955, and became president of Little, Brown, Ltd. (Canada) in 1956. He rose to the position of executive vice president in 1959, and finally, to president and CEO in 1962, succeeding his father Arthur H. Thornhill, Sr. (1895-1970). One of Thornhill's major achievements was negotiating the 1968 merger in which Little, Brown became a subsidiary of Time, Inc., while retaining an independent board of directors, a Massachusetts charter, and full editorial control in all publishing decisions. Major authors published by Little, Brown during his tenure include Norman Mailer, Herman Wouk, Ansel Adams, Lillian Hellman, John Fowles, and Henry Kissinger. Thornhill expanded and developed the law, medical, and college text divisions of the company, and ventured into trade paperback publishing. He was also involved in a variety of activities and organizations both inside and outside the publishing industry, chairing, for example, the American Book Publishers Council's Committee on Reading Development and serving on the Board of Trustees of the Princeton University Press, Bennington College, and the Martha's Vineyard Preservation Trust, and as a fellow at the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona. In 1987, Thornhill retired from Little, Brown. Thereafter, he and his wife Dorothy (deceased 2013) divided their time among residences in Virginia, Florida, and Martha's Vineyard. He was a member of the Union Club, the Century Club, the St. Botolph Club, the Edgartown Yacht Club, the Edgartown Reading Room, the John's Island Club, and the Farmington Country Club. He is survived by a daughter Sandra Brushart, a son Arthur III, and four grandchildren. A memorial service will be held later in Duxbury, Massachusetts.

He died December 3 at age 96 of congestive heart failure in Norwalk, CT. ""I feel that much of American art of the last 60 years has something missing, namely narrative,"" Lasker said in an interview. ""Without narrative there would be little left of the art of the Old Masters, of 20th-century expressionism and surrealism. There would be no Guernica by Picasso."" The New York Times art critic Howard DeVree wrote of Lasker, ""There is a psychological warmth and penetration in the work...especially stimulating canvasses...marvelo- usly effective...a tour de force."" His oil paintings and other depictions of cityscapes, landscapes, portraits, fantasies, interiors and still lifes hang in the permanent collections of the Whitney, Smithsonian, Hirshhorn, Philadelphia, Tel Aviv and other museums. He illustrated and/or wrote children's books, including American Library Association Notable Books Merry Ever After (1976) and The Boy Who Loved Music (1979) for Viking Press. His prizes include Prix de Rome and Guggenheim Fellowships and awards from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the National Academy of Design, where he was National Academician and secretary.

In Frankfurt she began her professional career working at McCann Advertising. In 1967, Ursula moved to New York and quickly became a sought after designer for leading international brands. In 1972, Ursula launched her own company. A true innovator for more than forty years, Ursula has nearly two hundred US patents associated with her product design work. Known for restrained designs that appealed to consumers worldwide and successfully drove sales, Ursula referred to her design work as ""playing with shapes."" Her mission was to ""create things that make everyday more beautiful."" The pursuit of perfection resulted in Ursula's award-winning and iconic 1970s design for Bristol-Myers Tickle deodorants. Flurer's impressive body of work includes beauty and healthcare package designs for Ponds, Colgate-Palmolive, Coty Inc., Del Laboratories, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Unilever, Lego, Playtex, and Weight Watchers International, to only name a few. Ursula had a lifelong curiosity of the world: self development, energies, dynamics, spirituality, cultures and communities. Together with her companion of the last 27 years, Dr. Howard Eggers, she traveled the globe making friends everywhere she went. For more than forty years, summer weekends found Ursula with the beaches and dunes of Davis Park, Fire Island. Truly her happy place. Next June a celebration of Ursula's life will take place on Fire Island. Ursula is survived by dozens of friends all around the world, who knew her unconditional kindness and who considered her to be ""family."" 1/3"

2015-12-27T00:00:00Z,"DULDNER--Kurt P. Kurt P. Duldner died peacefully surrounded by his family on December 3, 2015, one month shy of his 93rd birthday. Born on January 9, 1923 in Vienna, Austria, Kurt's carefree boyhood abruptly came to an end in 1938 with the Nazi invasion of Austria. Like thousands of other refugees, Kurt's journey to freedom and survival took him through the European underground to Brussels and France. Traveling with his older cousin, sewing and selling leather bags for pocket change, they traveled to Marseille, where they boarded a boat to Shanghai, one of the few places that accepted refugees without a visa. There they were reunited with Kurt's family and joined the community of 25,000 Jewish European refugees who had fled Nazi persecution. While in China he worked for a chemical trading company, which laid the groundwork for what would later be a successful career in the United States. When the Communist government came to power in 1949, Kurt, unable to find work, moved to New York CIty. There he met and married his first wife Ida. Together they had two children, Marianne and Laura. Kurt's love of life knew no bounds. Beyond being a devoted and generous family man, he had the incredible gift to be able to connect with all sorts of people in various walks of life: befriending countless colleagues, taxi drivers, workmen, elevator men, and hat check ladies. An inimitable force, he brought life to any party and a smile to those he met. He had a long and successful career and was widely known and respected by his many friends for his business acumen, considerable intelligence, lively wit, and infectious sense of humor including his hilariously botched sayings such as ""we will come to that bridge when we get there,"" ""grab the horn by the bull"" and ""get me off the hooker."" Kurt never forgot his love and gratitude to the Chinese people. He was instrumental in erecting a commemorative plaque in Shanghai thanking the Chinese people for creating a safe haven for the Jewish refugees. Whether traveling the world, skiing the slopes of Aspen, playing an intense tennis match, or enjoying the symphony and opera, Kurt's love of life knew no bounds. And in keeping true to his Viennese roots, no meal, whether served in a four star restaurant, or a salami sandwich, was complete without a glass of fine wine and a good piece of chocolate. He shared his love of life with the family he cherished, his beloved wife, Anne Foster Duldner, devoted daughters Marianne and Laura, dear son-in-law Steven Sherman and treasured granddaughters Lilli and Nicole. With a twinkle in his eye and that knowing grin, he enriched the lives of everyone who had the privilege of knowing him. Dear, sweet Kurti, a life well lived. 1/3"

2015-12-27T00:00:00Z,"GOLDMAN--William ""Bill"" Allen. 1940-2015. Bill Goldman's deep, wide chest held a heart that always had room for one more. All who met Bill recognized and responded to his quick wit, compassionate nature and propensity for corny jokes. In 1966, Bill joined the law firm, Dreisbach, Crabbe, Newlon, Bilger, Brown & James. He left to serve as general counsel for the Homewood Corporation, and guided their expansion. In 1999, Bill returned to the legal profession, setting up a fortuitous partnership with Michael Braunstein, Professor Emeritus at The Ohio State University. Together, Goldman & Braunstein cut a brilliant swath through the field of eminent domain, defending Ohio property owners faced with the threat of losing their land to powerful pipeline companies. The two became business partners and best friends. Bill was as comfortable in a room full of flannel- shirted farmers as he was in a courtroom. ""Leveling the playing field"" for landowners became Bill's mission and passion. With the steadfast support of his beloved paralegal, Sherry Evanichko, Goldman & Braunstein became the Midwest's leading eminent domain firm. Personally, Bill mixed long-term, treasured relationships with newer, equally meaningful, friendships. He found happiness with his ""third and final"" wife, Joanna, an enduring union for the last 25 years. Both enjoyed spending time with family and their multi- generational friends, traveling, reading and debating. There wasn't a more ardent Ohio State University Buckeye fan or scathing couch- coach than Bill. Bill and Joanna enjoyed time in California with the family they treasured: Kimberly (Goldman) and Javier Garcia, Shelby and Beth Goldman, grandkids Tyler, Madeleine Rose, Vincent, Julia and Will, beloved sister-in-law Betty Larson, and faithful dogs, Teddy and Winston. Bill embraced his community, serving on the Boards of the Jewish Community Center of Greater Columbus, Franklin County Veterans Memorial and The Columbus Zoo. Bill filled his six-foot-three frame with optimism, boundless energy and a voice that commanded attention. He spoke his mind, eloquently and passionately. He was a friend everyone could count on. He touched the lives of thousands, loved and admired by countless clients, colleagues and friends. He will never be forgotten. 1/3"

2015-12-29T00:00:00Z,"SPITZER--Robert, M.D. The faculty and staff of the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute and New York-Presbyterian Hospital deeply mourn the passing of our beloved and distinguished colleague, Robert Spitzer, M.D. Dr. Spitzer completed his psychiatric residency at Columbia and was a vital member of the faculty for over half a century. The seminal achievement of his career was the establishment of a diagnostic system that was empirically based on uniform standards. The third revision of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-III), developed under his supervision, revolutionized the field of psychiatry and had a transformative effect on the diagnosis and treatment of patients and on psychiatric research. Dr. Spitzer's enlightened scholarship and commitment to rigorous research methodology helped the field of psychiatry evolve from an ideologically based theory driven discipline to one scientifically guided by empirical data. In addition to his leadership role in developing DSM-III, Dr. Spitzer's notable achievements included his instrumental role in the processes that eliminated homosexuality as a mental disorder and established the diagnosis of PTSD as a pathologic sequela of experiential trauma. As a researcher, educator and mentor, Dr. Spitzer's lifelong accomplishments in nosology and diagnostic assessment have fundamentally changed both psychiatric research and the practice of psychiatry in the United States and internationally. It is with fond memories and heartfelt sadness that we mourn our dear colleague and extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Dr. Janet Williams, and the entire Spitzer family. Jeffrey A.

2015-12-29T00:00:00Z,"KELLY--Ellsworth. The Trustees and the Staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art mourn the passing of Ellsworth Kelly, a dear friend of the Museum for nearly six decades. Kelly was first shown at the Whitney in the exhibition Young America 1957; that same year the Whitney acquired his now iconic painting, Atlantic (1956). This two panel composition was the first painting by the artist to enter a museum collection, and it has remained one of our most treasured works. Kelly's paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings have been displayed in more than 60 exhibitions at the Museum, including the first retrospective of his sculptures, organized by the Whitney in 1982. On the occasion of his 80th birthday, the Museum presented the exhibition Ellsworth Kelly: Red Green Blue (2003). The Whitney is proud to hold more than 40 of Kelly's works in its collection, several of which were generous gifts of the artist. ""All my work comes from perceiving,"" he once explained; we will greatly miss him and his ability to create profound and enduring works of art from the seemingly ephemeral forms and phenomena of the world. We extend our deepest sympathy to his beloved Jack Shear and to his many dear friends. Leonard A. Lauder, Chairman Emeritus; Flora Miller Biddle, Honorary Chairman; Neil G. Bluhm, Co-Chair; Laurie M.

Revered and respected throughout the world, we will be forever grateful for his generosity, for the works he gave so enthusiastically to our Foundation, and for his commitment to FAPE's mission. From a sketch on a paper napkin came the design of two magnificent wall sculptures for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, which greet more than 2,000 Chinese visa applicants daily, employing the colors in our two countries' flags to honor the relationship between the U.S. and China. In Berlin, Ellsworth watched as the 40- foot-high 'Berlin Totem' he created for the U.S. Embassy soared through the air to be placed in its courtyard garden. His extraordinary lithograph, 'Leaves,' adorns the walls of 50 U.S. embassies; and he contributed to our Collection at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, as well as our millennium Gift To The Nation. He also donated the actual award that we present annually to the recipient of the Leonore and Walter Annenberg Award for Diplomacy through the Arts; the first honoree was Justice Stephen Breyer, who collaborated with Ellsworth on his site- specific installation at the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in Boston. Ellsworth's last gift to FAPE was the establishment of an endowment, entitled the Ellsworth Kelly Fund for Preservation, to ensure FAPE's Collection is maintained in perpetuity at no cost to the government. Words cannot express how important Ellsworth was to FAPE. His gifts are a testament to his creativity, his genius and his extraordinary spirit. He will always remain in our memory, and his work will remind us of his belief in the importance of art as a means of freedom of expression and cross-cultural understanding. We send our deepest condolences to Jack Shear.

Revered and respected throughout the world, we will be forever grateful for his generosity, for the works he gave so enthusiastically to our Foundation, and for his commitment to FAPE's mission. From a sketch on a paper napkin came the design of two magnificent wall sculptures for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, which greet more than 2,000 Chinese visa applicants daily, employing the colors in our two countries' flags to honor the relationship between the U.S. and China. In Berlin, Ellsworth watched as the 40- foot-high 'Berlin Totem' he created for the U.S. Embassy soared through the air to be placed in its courtyard garden. His extraordinary lithograph, 'Leaves,' adorns the walls of 50 U.S. embassies; and he contributed to our Collection at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, as well as our millennium Gift To The Nation. He also donated the actual award that we present annually to the recipient of the Leonore and Walter Annenberg Award for Diplomacy through the Arts; the first honoree was Justice Stephen Breyer, who collaborated with Ellsworth on his site- specific installation at the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in Boston. Ellsworth's last gift to FAPE was the establishment of an endowment, entitled the Ellsworth Kelly Fund for Preservation, to ensure FAPE's Collection is maintained in perpetuity at no cost to the government. Words cannot express how important Ellsworth was to FAPE. His gifts are a testament to his creativity, his genius and his extraordinary spirit. He will always remain in our memory, and his work will remind us of his belief in the importance of art as a means of freedom of expression and cross-cultural understanding. We send our deepest condolences to Jack Shear.

Born in New York City, Charlie was a graduate of Riverdale Country Day School and Amherst College. He spent his early investment career at M.A. Shapiro, New Court Securities, and E.M. Warburg Pincus. For the past 32 years, Charlie and Kristin were business partners of Flood Gamble Associates, an investment management firm. Recently, Flood Gamble joined American Capital Management. Charlie was a dedicated and scrupulously honest businessperson who brought his deep intelligence to his tireless work for his clients. He enjoyed getting to know people of all backgrounds and loved nothing more than the everyday banter he had with friends, clients, neighbors, and everyone he encountered. He had a unique sense of humor and enjoyed gently ribbing people. His weekends were spent gardening and doing chores-Charlie's way of relaxing-in their second home and beloved community of Hudson, New York. Charlie loved the Hudson Valley and, with Kristin, was dedicated to the protection of the Hudson River and its environs. A lifelong Democrat and avid Obama supporter, Charlie enjoyed talking politics and railing against what he felt were the wrongs in society. He also contributed to many social causes. Charlie learned guitar as an adult and his playing and singing were an integral part of his time spent with family. A much-loved spouse, father, and grandfather, Charlie will be greatly missed by his wife of 40 years, Kristin Gamble, his daughters Deborah Flood and Karen Flood, his son-in-law Michael Benedek, and his grandchildren Naomi, Oscar and Violet. A celebration of Charlie will be held at 4:30pm on January 7 at the Metropolitan Club at 1 East 60th Street in New York City.

2015-12-31T00:00:00Z,"KELLY--Ellsworth. The Checkerboard Film Foundation is very saddened at the passing of Ellsworth Kelly, seminal artist and true gentleman. In 2007, we were privileged to produce, with Jo Carole Lauder, the documentary film, ""Ellsworth Kelly: Fragments."" Most memorably, we filmed Ellsworth in Paris as he recounted his formative experiences while living there from 1948 to 1954, and his exploration of French culture and monuments that so informed his work. He said: ""In my paintings, I am not inventing; my ideas come from constantly investigating how things look."" They included the shadows of an arch of a bridge on the Seine (""White Plaque: Bridge Arch and Reflection,"" 1951-55); the external chimneys on the wall of a building (""Ormesson,"" 1950); and the long angular windows at The Museum of Modern Art, Paris (""Window,"" his first panel painting, 1949).

Revered and respected throughout the world, we will be forever grateful for his generosity, for the works he gave so enthusiastically to our Foundation, and for his commitment to FAPE's mission. From a sketch on a paper napkin came the design of two magnificent wall sculptures for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, which greet more than 2,000 Chinese visa applicants daily, employing the colors in our two countries' flags to honor the relationship between the U.S. and China. In Berlin, Ellsworth watched as the 40- foot-high 'Berlin Totem' he created for the U.S. Embassy soared through the air to be placed in its courtyard garden. His extraordinary lithograph, 'Leaves,' adorns the walls of 50 U.S. embassies; and he contributed to our Collection at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, as well as our millennium Gift To The Nation. He also donated the actual award that we present annually to the recipient of the Leonore and Walter Annenberg Award for Diplomacy through the Arts; the first honoree was Justice Stephen Breyer, who collaborated with Ellsworth on his site- specific installation at the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in Boston. Ellsworth's last gift to FAPE was the establishment of an endowment, entitled the Ellsworth Kelly Fund for Preservation, to ensure FAPE's Collection is maintained in perpetuity at no cost to the government. Words cannot express how important Ellsworth was to FAPE. His gifts are a testament to his creativity, his genius and his extraordinary spirit. He will always remain in our memory, and his work will remind us of his belief in the importance of art as a means of freedom of expression and cross-cultural understanding. We send our deepest condolences to Jack Shear.

In the business world she played an important role in managing important areas of the Belz Enterprises in Memphis and beyond.

Born in New York City, Charlie was a graduate of Riverdale Country Day School and Amherst College. He spent his early investment career at M.A. Shapiro, New Court Securities, and E.M. Warburg Pincus. For the past 32 years, Charlie and Kristin were business partners of Flood Gamble Associates, an investment management firm. Recently, Flood Gamble joined American Capital Management. Charlie was a dedicated and scrupulously honest businessperson who brought his deep intelligence to his tireless work for his clients. He enjoyed getting to know people of all backgrounds and loved nothing more than the everyday banter he had with friends, clients, neighbors, and everyone he encountered. He had a unique sense of humor and enjoyed gently ribbing people. His weekends were spent gardening and doing chores-Charlie's way of relaxing-in their second home and beloved community of Hudson, New York. Charlie loved the Hudson Valley and, with Kristin, was dedicated to the protection of the Hudson River and its environs. A lifelong Democrat and avid Obama supporter, Charlie enjoyed talking politics and railing against what he felt were the wrongs in society. He also contributed to many social causes. Charlie learned guitar as an adult and his playing and singing were an integral part of his time spent with family. A much-loved spouse, father, and grandfather, Charlie will be greatly missed by his wife of 40 years, Kristin Gamble, his daughters Deborah Flood and Karen Flood, his son-in-law Michael Benedek, and his grandchildren Naomi, Oscar and Violet.

A lifelong Democrat and avid Obama supporter, Charlie enjoyed talking politics and railing against what he felt were the wrongs in society. He also contributed to many social causes.

2016-01-03T00:00:00Z,"KELLY--Ellsworth. The Foundation for Art and Preservation in Embassies (FAPE) is profoundly saddened by the loss of Ellsworth Kelly. Revered and respected throughout the world, we will be forever grateful for his generosity, for the works he gave so enthusiastically to our Foundation, and for his commitment to FAPE's mission. From a sketch on a paper napkin came the design of two magnificent wall sculptures for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, which greet more than 2,000 Chinese visa applicants daily, employing the colors in our two countries' flags to honor the relationship between the U.S. and China. In Berlin, Ellsworth watched as the 40- foot-high 'Berlin Totem' he created for the U.S. Embassy soared through the air to be placed in its courtyard garden. His extraordinary lithograph, 'Leaves,' adorns the walls of 50 U.S. embassies; and he contributed to our Collection at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, as well as our millennium Gift To The Nation. He also donated the actual award that we present annually to the recipient of the Leonore and Walter Annenberg Award for Diplomacy through the Arts; the first honoree was Justice Stephen Breyer, who collaborated with Ellsworth on his site- specific installation at the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in Boston. Ellsworth's last gift to FAPE was the establishment of an endowment, entitled the Ellsworth Kelly Fund for Preservation, to ensure FAPE's Collection is maintained in perpetuity at no cost to the government. Words cannot express how important Ellsworth was to FAPE. His gifts are a testament to his creativity, his genius and his extraordinary spirit. He will always remain in our memory, and his work will remind us of his belief in the importance of art as a means of freedom of expression and cross-cultural understanding. We send our deepest condolences to Jack Shear.

Gil brought his financial acumen and keen insight to Carnegie Hall's management as a longstanding member of the Finance and Operations Committee, where he helped govern major institutional advances from the restoration of Carnegie Hall to the creation of an education center. Following his successful career in business and journalism, Gil became a celebrated scholar of Gustav Mahler, establishing the Kaplan Foundation and conducting Mahler's Second Symphony with leading orchestras around the world. Gil was invited by the Vienna Philharmonic to conduct the original version of Mahler's Second Symphony and his recordings of the Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic were very successful. Gil demonstrated his deep love and knowledge of music every season as a frequent concertgoer, and many members of the Carnegie Hall's family were honored to be guests on Gil's acclaimed radio program ""Mad About Music."" We will always remember Gil for his warmth, musical scholarship, and his love of Carnegie Hall. We express our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Lena; his devoted children Kristina, Claude, John, and Emily; and their families and loved ones. Sanford I. Weill, President; Mercedes Bass, Acting Chairman; Clive Gillinson, Executive and Artistic Director 1/3"

An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony. He said of the symphony that it ""wrapped itself around me and never let go."" This passion ultimately led to conducting engagements with over 60 orchestras throughout the world, acclaimed recordings of the work with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic and, more recently, a faculty position at Juilliard. His private life was just as rich. He married the woman he loved at first sight, loved her deeply to the end, and together they presided over a family of four beautiful children, Kristina Wallison, Claude Davies, John Kaplan and Emily Kaplan, and eight grandchildren. All grieve profoundly at his passing, but feel deeply blessed to have loved and been loved by this remarkable man. The family will receive friends at the Frank E.

2016-01-04T00:00:00Z,"TRYFOROS--Nicholas James, July 27, 1923-December 31, 2015. Nicholas James Tryforos, son of James and Garufa, was the youngest and last survivor of thirteen children. In explaining why ""Mama and Papa had thirteen children, not twelve or fourteen"" Nick said, ""When I was born, papa picked me up, checked me out, and said 'Mama! FINALLY a perfect baby.'"" A lifelong New Yorker, he was a proud graduate of The Greek American Institute, Theodore Roosevelt High School and New York University. He served in the Army in WWII. After basic training, the Army sent him to language school to become a Hindustani interpreter. He received horse cavalry and military intelligence training, and then served in the Philippines and in General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo during the occupation of Japan. Nick used his Hindustani skills for the rest of his life to surprise and delight both friends and complete strangers from India. After returning from Japan Nick worked for 15 years in the family flower and novelty business, then had a 25-year career with the IRS, retiring in 1986 as a Group Manager, supervising large corporation tax audits. Amateur gymnast, superb photographer, family documenter and archivist, Nick was the favorite uncle of many and worked hard to make and cultivate relationships with family and friends. He collected any piece of junk that could potentially serve a future purpose, taught his children the value of a dollar and the importance of grunt labor, and was the original tiger mom and DIY guy. He was the resident teaser (while being wheeled to major surgery with four children at home, Nick whispered to his wife ""don't worry dear, as long as we have our health!"") and an inveterate joke teller (""Have you heard the one about the skeleton that walked into a bar...""). Nick delighted in meeting his children's friends, showing them photos related (and unrelated!) to their discussion, and always enjoyed giving them another tour of the garage! Nick was quietly proud of everyone in his family, and his family was very fortunate to have him. He leaves behind his dear wife of 63 years and best friend Mary, and his children, Margaret and her husband Paul, Jim and his wife Sue, Tom, and Tina and her husband David. He also leaves his grandchildren, Peter, Evan, Kate and her husband Pat, John, Lucas, Eva, and Eli, and great-grandson Theo. Within minutes of Nick's passing, his second great-grandson, Grant, was born. Visitation will be held from 6 to 9pm Monday, January 4th at Frederick Funeral Home in Flushing, and funeral services at 11:30am Tuesday at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in Flushing.

Molly was born Josephine Hamlin Moll on October 29, 1930, in Detroit, MI, to Josephine Hamlin and The Honorable Lester Moll, a prominent Detroit prosecutor and judge. She grew up in Grosse Pointe, MI. In 1953, she married William W. Boeschenstein, who was working for Owens Corning in Detroit. The couple later moved to Perrysburg, Ohio, where they raised four sons. Mr. Boeschenstein ultimately became Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Owens Corning in Toledo, Ohio. Although her husband became the public face of the company, Molly was a genuine partner to him throughout his career. Molly was known for her intelligence, style, love of competition, and her outstanding, irreverent sense of humor. Conversations with her were punctuated by astute observations, humorous ripostes, and often times belly shaking laughter. She had a wide and deep circle of friends from every corner of her life. Molly was deeply involved in a number of civic and charitable organizations. Notably, she was the first President of the St. Vincent Medical Center Foundation in Toledo, OH, a committed volunteer at the Toledo Museum of Art, and a member of the Board of Directors of The National Council on Alcoholism and Addiction and The Freedom Institute in New York. Molly and her husband have made their principal residence in Hobe Sound, FL. She is survived by her husband of 62 years, William W. Boeschenstein, sons William Jr., Michael, Peter and Stephen, their spouses, and 10 grandchildren and one great- grandchild. Funeral services are pending.

An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony.

For many, he was the lanky, redheaded and perennially boyish fashion and style reporter for The New York Times, Harper's Bazaar, Esquire and Golf. For others, he was an inspirational practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism: he brought comfort, joy and wisdom to many through his example, his guidance and his two books, ""The Buddha in Your Mirror"" and ""The Buddha in Your Rearview Mirror."" In Sharon, CT, where he had lived since 1993, he was known as a quirky character with memorable pickup trucks (his beautiful golden retriever, Lola, nearly always along for the ride) and a passion for swimming, biking and otherwise enjoying the beauty around him. For his daughter, Kate, he was her biggest cheerleader as well as the person who always encouraged her to set a high standard and then meet it. He adored her, and she adored him. A true journalist, Woody was interested in everything; for the past few years, he was able to travel widely and meet interesting people in the company of his girlfriend, Kirsten Jensen. His daughter and former wife, Cynthia, were glad that he was able to enrich his life and expand his horizons with Kirsten before his death, from a glioblastoma tumor, on December 31.

Memorial Service Friday, January 8th, 12:00pm, Short Hills Community Congregational Church. Luncheon Friday, January 8th, after the service, Short Hills Club, 144 Highland Avenue. James C. Kellogg, philanthropist and loving husband, father of three children, and grandfather of nine grandchildren, died on Thursday of congestive heart failure, surrounded by his family. He was 76 years old. Jim was a graduate of The Pingry School, Princeton University, and Harvard Law School. During his career, he was a partner at the Manhattan law firm Townley & Updike, the President of the Community Foundation of New Jersey, the President of the J.C. Kellogg Foundation, and a valued trustee of many non-profit boards. He was most proud of his philanthropic work in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He cherished the idea of creating opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds to be healthy, learn, and grow. Jim grew up in Elizabeth, NJ and spent his summers in Bay Head, NJ, where he made many friends whom he kept throughout his life. Those friends would gather on a regular basis for couples' dinners and bridge marathons. He looked forward to Romeo lunches, Scorpions bridge, and the Literatti book club, where he always touted the latest political book. In the past few years, Jim became a Life Master at bridge by participating in ACBL bridge tournaments across the country. He spent his winters at Yeamans Hall in South Carolina. Jim had a deep commitment to public service; he advised and served on the boards of Frost Valley YMCA, Bay Head Chapel, Short Hills Community Congregational Church, Point Pleasant Hospital, the Children's Specialized Hospital, Trinitas Regional Medical Center, Meridian Health Systems, Council of Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, Union County College, Bloomfield College, the Prudential Insurance Company, New Jersey State in the Trust for Public Lands, and the Scholarship Fund for Inner City Children. He was appointed by the Governor to the boards of New Jersey Transit and the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. His lifelong passion for philanthropy paled in comparison to his love for his family- his wife, three children, and nine grandchildren. Jim was happiest at family gatherings and loved playing backgammon and gin rummy with his children and grandchildren. Pop Pop's signature backgammon move was to wait for his opponent to admit defeat only to turn the board around and play the losing side, teaching his mentee how to stage a comeback and win! He was active in every aspect of his children's and grandchildren's lives, including attending their school events, and offering advice on and help with work issues. He is survived by his wife, Gail Chambers Kellogg, his children, Jimmy Kellogg, Kate Kellogg, and Elizabeth Kellogg Winterbottom; adoring grandchildren, Emily, Jimmy and Grace Kellogg; Chris and Andrew Kellogg Peeler; Hailey, Francesca, Maile, and Penelope Winterbottom; and his three younger brothers, Peter, Kelly, and Rusty. A service to celebrate his life will be held Friday, January 8th at 12:00pm at the Short Hills Community Congregational Church. Immediately following the service, the family invites all attendees to join them for lunch at the Short Hills Club. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the Frost Valley YMCA in Claryville, NY. For more info, or to send condolences to the family, please visit www.bradleyfuneral homes.com. 1/3"

An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony.

His private life was just as rich. He married the woman he loved at first sight, loved her deeply to the end, and together they presided over a family of four beautiful children, Kristina Wallison, Claude Davies, John Kaplan and Emily Kaplan, and eight grandchildren.

2016-01-07T00:00:00Z,"BOULEZ--Pierre. The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall celebrate the life of our dear friend and colleague Pierre Boulez, one of the most important and influential artists of the 20th century. A legendary composer, conductor, musical philosopher and activist, Pierre Boulez was a visionary and trailblazing global force for modern music. Carnegie Hall was privileged to elect him an Honorary Trustee in 1995, and to appoint him as the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair from 1999 to 2003. Boulez made approximately 75 appearances at Carnegie Hall, conducting close to 60 performances on our stages, and his works have been performed on more than 80 programs. As an arts educator, he was inspirational-challenging audiences to explore a new aesthetic of music through his musical research center IRCAM, and, in the course of the Professional Training Workshops he led through Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute, offering profound insights to young musicians. Boulez's work in Paris served as an inspiration in the conception of Zankel Hall, the opening season of which included performances by Boulez with the Ensemble Intercontemporain. Pierre Boulez will be deeply missed by all of us at Carnegie Hall and by the entire artistic community, though his brilliant musical legacy and pioneering spirit will stay with us all.

An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony. He said of the symphony that it ""wrapped itself around me and never let go."" This passion ultimately led to conducting engagements with over 60 orchestras throughout the world, acclaimed recordings of the work with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic and, more recently, a faculty position at Juilliard. His private life was just as rich. He married the woman he loved at first sight, loved her deeply to the end, and together they presided over a family of four beautiful children, Kristina Wallison, Claude Davies, John Kaplan and Emily Kaplan, and eight grandchildren. All grieve profoundly at his passing, but feel deeply blessed to have loved and been loved by this remarkable man. The family will receive friends at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue (at 81st Street) in New York City, on Thursday, January 7 at 2-5pm and 7-9pm.

Under Boulez, the Philharmonic introduced concert formats that brought the audience in direct contact with composers and performers, including the informal Rug Concerts and downtown Prospective Encounters. He returned in 1986 for a 14- event series highlighting his work as conductor, composer, and leader of the Ensemble Intercontemporain. In 1992 he celebrated the Philharmonic's 150th anniversary in a concert also led by former Music Directors Zubin Mehta and Kurt Masur. In the same year Boulez was made an Honorary Member of the Society, an honor shared by such figures as Wagner, Stravinsky, and Bernstein. New York Philharmonic Music Director Alan Gilbert said: ""Pierre Boulez was a towering and influential musical figure whose Philharmonic leadership implicitly laid down a challenge of innovation and invention that continues to inspire us to this day. To me, personally, he also was an unfailingly gracious mentor and friend, from the years when I worked with him in Cleveland and when I was appointed to the Philharmonic to the last time I saw him in Baden- Baden on a Philharmonic tour. I will miss his musicianship, kindness, and wisdom."" The New York Philharmonic family sends our love and compassion to his family. 1/3"

Born in Bellevue, Ohio during the Depression, the son of a grocer, he became a page in the U.S. Senate in 1944 and then won scholarships to Philips Academy, Andover and Harvard, an institution he didn't leave until retirement. He graduated magna cum laude with highest honors in 1954, received his Ph.D. in 1960, and was made Professor of English and Comparative Literature in 1969. From 1988 to 2002 he served as Director of Villa I Tatti, the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies in Florence. His leadership profoundly shaped I Tatti, and those were among his happiest years; he always felt that he truly belonged to the northern Mediterranean, especially to Greece and Italy. His love of learning and the arts gave color and depth to every aspect of his life. Few people have been more learned or more cultivated, wittier or more awake to beauty. Fewer still have had his genius for friendship. He was extraordinarily generous with his attention, and always finding opportunities for generosity where others wouldn't have seen them. He was the best of fathers. He is survived by his children, Miranda and David, and three granddaughters; by his brother, Bob; by his many godchildren; and by hundreds of others whose lives he enriched immeasurably, as the astonishing outpouring of grief and love from around the world since his death attests. Contributions in his memory may be made to the Walter Kaiser Fund for the Biblioteca Berenson at Villa I Tatti, Harvard University. 1/3"

As Chief Judge, Judith created the Adoption Now program, helped establish the Center for Court Innovation and co-chaired the ABA Commission on the American Jury. She retired from the bench in 2008, having served longer than any Chief Judge in state history. At Skadden, Judith helped numerous clients navigate complex issues of New York law.

The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall celebrate the life of our dear friend and colleague Pierre Boulez, one of the most important and influential artists of the 20th century. A legendary composer, conductor, musical philosopher and activist, Pierre Boulez was a visionary and trailblazing global force for modern music. Carnegie Hall was privileged to elect him an Honorary Trustee in 1995, and to appoint him as the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair from 1999 to 2003. Boulez made approximately 75 appearances at Carnegie Hall, conducting close to 60 performances on our stages, and his works have been performed on more than 80 programs. As an arts educator, he was inspirational-challenging audiences to explore a new aesthetic of music through his musical research center IRCAM, and, in the course of the Professional Training Workshops he led through Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute, offering profound insights to young musicians. Boulez's work in Paris served as an inspiration in the conception of Zankel Hall, the opening season of which included performances by Boulez with the Ensemble Intercontemporain. Pierre Boulez will be deeply missed by all of us at Carnegie Hall and by the entire artistic community, though his brilliant musical legacy and pioneering spirit will stay with us all. We express heartfelt condolences to his sister, Jeanne Chevalier Boulez, and brother, Roger Boulez, as well as their many children and grandchildren. Sanford I. Weill, President; Mercedes T.

Before joining our New York appellate litigation and arbitration practice in 2009, Judith spent 25 years on the bench of the New York Court of Appeals, including the last 15 as its Chief Judge. The first woman to serve on New York's highest court, Judith earned a national reputation for her pioneering opinions and court reforms. She wrote seminal opinions on such issues as the death penalty, same-sex marriage, education and state constitutional rights while leading innovative changes to the New York court system, including the establishment of specialized courts to focus on issues of drug addiction, domestic violence and mental health. As Chief Judge, Judith created the Adoption Now program, helped establish the Center for Court Innovation and co-chaired the ABA Commission on the American Jury. She retired from the bench in 2008, having served longer than any Chief Judge in state history. At Skadden, Judith helped numerous clients navigate complex issues of New York law. She also served as a trustee of the Skadden Fellowship Foundation and continued her advocacy for families and children, including through her service as the chairwoman of the Permanent Judicial Commission on Justice for Children. Judith graduated from Barnard College ('58) and NYU School of Law ('62), where she was one of 10 women in a class of nearly 300. Judith is survived by her children, Luisa, Jonathan and Gordon, and seven grandchildren. She will be greatly missed.

Over the years, she wrote for the Fordham Law Review and other journals, and she inspired students, graduates, and alumni with her remarks at the school's diploma ceremony, conferences, and lecture series. The school honored her in 2002 with the Fordham- Stein Prize, which is presented annually to a member of the legal profession whose work embodies the highest standards of the legal profession. In 2012, she participated in a special conversation alongside retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor that canvassed their concerns about the election of judges, the importance of civic education and involvement for lawyers, and their pathbreaking appointments as the first women to hold their respective judicial roles. In addition to her jurisprudence, her administrative impact will leave an indelible mark on the office of Chief Judge of the State of New York.

In Sharon, CT, where he had lived since 1993, he was known as a quirky character with memorable pickup trucks (his beautiful golden retriever, Lola, nearly always along for the ride) and a passion for swimming, biking and otherwise enjoying the beauty around him. For his daughter, Kate, he was her biggest cheerleader as well as the person who always encouraged her to set a high standard and then meet it. He adored her, and she adored him. A true journalist, Woody was interested in everything; for the past few years, he was able to travel widely and meet interesting people in the company of his girlfriend, Kirsten Jensen.

(1929-2016), an Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, who made important contributions to the study of higher education, labor markets and industrial sociology, died on January 1, 2016. Dr. Berg's classic book, Education and Jobs: The Great Training Robbery (1970) cast doubt on economists' assertions that people with more education earn more because they are more skilled and productive; instead, employers frequently hire people to work in jobs that do not make use of their education. His book played a major role in a landmark civil rights decision by the U. S. Supreme Court, Griggs vs. Duke Power Company (1971) and was credited with providing the bases of the theory of market signaling, for which Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics. Among his many honors, he was elected a Fellow of the International Academy of Management, which cited him as ""one of the seminal figures in the sociological study of labor markets and the founder of economic sociology."" Born January 3, 1929 in Brooklyn, NY, he earned his AB at Colgate and his doctorate at Harvard. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps, retiring as a major, and on the faculties of Columbia and Vanderbilt, in addition to Penn.

He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Joanne Kelly Hagopian; his daughter Susan Goddard and sons Thomas and Matthew; nine grandchildren; his sister Helen Geovjian; and more than 40 members of his extended family. Lou thought himself to be one of the luckiest men in the world, with a wife and family who loved him and whom he loved dearly, parents he respected and adored and a career he both enjoyed and succeeded in beyond his wildest hopes. As the son of parents who fled to the United States after their families were killed in the Armenian Genocide, he felt that he truly lived the American Dream and loved this country for it. Lou served in the US Navy during World War II and graduated from Michigan State University after the War. His career started in the auto business, but his skills in marketing and communications soon led him to a successful career in advertising with the oldest agency in the US, NW Ayer. He led NW Ayer for over 25 years, including the last ten as Chairman and CEO. During his tenure, Ayer was selected Agency of the Year and developed numerous iconic advertising campaigns with taglines such as ""A Diamond is Forever"" and ""Be All That You Can Be."" He also was Chairman of the Advertising Association of America and a founding member of the innovative Partnership for Drug-Free America. Lou was a man of style with an enormous heart, tremendous charm and a wicked wit. He loved to serenade his wife, Joanne, with ""Misty"" or ""My Funny Valentine"" whenever given the slightest excuse (and often without). An avid and excellent golfer for over 70 years, he started as a caddy at the Pine Lake Country Club outside of Detroit and ended as a member of the Royal & Ancient Golf Club in St. Andrews (where he won the Seniors Tournament at the age of 86).

He loved them and they returned that love many times over. His joy came from sparing his patients the pain, discomfort, and humiliation of inflammatory bowel disease by finding the right combination of medications and thoughtful creativity. He fought against surgery if there was a possible medical solution. He talked with his patients for many more hours than any HMO wouId have allowed. He sat at their bedside and visited them late at night, he celebrated when they felt better. Nothing made him happier than a college student being able to return to school, or a young adult feeling well enough to plan a wedding or bear a child. He loved teaching young Gastroenterologists and, along with a grateful patient, created the Present-Levison fourth year fellowship in Clinical GI, which allowed the brightest young men and women to spend a post-graduate year learning clinical GI at Mt. Sinai. These fellows now care for IBD patients all over the world. Funeral services will be held on Thursday at 12pm at ""The Riverside,"" 180 West 76th St., New York. Contributions in Dan's memory may be made to the Present-Levison Fellowship at Mt. Sinai, and sent to the Division of Gastroenterology, Mt. Sinai Hospital, Box 1069, New York, New York 10029. 1/3"

He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Joanne Kelly Hagopian; his daughter Susan Goddard and sons Thomas and Matthew; nine grandchildren; his sister Helen Geovjian; and more than 40 members of his extended family. Lou thought himself to be one of the luckiest men in the world, with a wife and family who loved him and whom he loved dearly, parents he respected and adored and a career he both enjoyed and succeeded in beyond his wildest hopes. As the son of parents who fled to the United States after their families were killed in the Armenian Genocide, he felt that he truly lived the American Dream and loved this country for it. Lou served in the US Navy during World War II and graduated from Michigan State University after the War. His career started in the auto business, but his skills in marketing and communications soon led him to a successful career in advertising with the oldest agency in the US, NW Ayer. He led NW Ayer for over 25 years, including the last ten as Chairman and CEO. During his tenure, Ayer was selected Agency of the Year and developed numerous iconic advertising campaigns with taglines such as ""A Diamond is Forever"" and ""Be All That You Can Be."" He also was Chairman of the Advertising Association of America and a founding member of the innovative Partnership for Drug-Free America. Lou was a man of style with an enormous heart, tremendous charm and a wicked wit. He loved to serenade his wife, Joanne, with ""Misty"" or ""My Funny Valentine"" whenever given the slightest excuse (and often without). An avid and excellent golfer for over 70 years, he started as a caddy at the Pine Lake Country Club outside of Detroit and ended as a member of the Royal & Ancient Golf Club in St. Andrews (where he won the Seniors Tournament at the age of 86). Services will be held at St. Thomas More Catholic Church in Darien, CT at 10:30am on Saturday, January 16. A memorial service will also be scheduled for friends and relatives in Vero Beach in the next several weeks.

2016-01-13T00:00:00Z,"BARNET--Sylvan, born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 11, 1926, died at home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on January 9, 2016. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, then graduated from New York University (1948), Phi Beta Kappa, and entered the graduate program at Harvard (Ph.D. in English Language and Literature, 1954), where he wrote a prize-winning essay on Shakespeare. He spent his entire teaching career at Tufts University (1954-84), serving twice as chair of the Department of English. He published a number of essays in scholarly journals, a popular introduction to Shakespeare, and he served as General Editor of The Signet Classic Shakespeare, a paperback series (one play per volume) that is widely used in colleges and universities. He was also the author or co-author of several widely used textbooks-on argument (with Hugo Bedau, late of the Tufts Department of Philosophy), art, composition, drama, and literature, including ""A Short Guide to Writing about Art"" (now in its 11th edition), and ""Introduction to Literature"" (16th edition). In 1963, he and William Burto (his partner since 1952, deceased 2013) developed an interest in Japanese art, especially calligraphy, and they went on to build a collection that was exhibited in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Freer Gallery, the Harvard Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Art, Houston. The Metropolitan exhibition was accompanied by a catalog by Miyeko Murase, ""The Written Image"" (2002), to which Barnet and Burto contributed two essays, one on collecting, the other on looking at calligraphy from a Western point of view. (After Burto's death their collection was divided among the first four of these museums.) He and Burto also wrote ""Zen Ink Paintings"" (1982) as well as several essays on Japanese art. As a teacher of English literature, he was familiar with a good deal of writing about death. Among the favorite passages he carried in his head-he could not understand why some educators disparage ""rote memory""-were Shakespeare's ""Golden lads and girls all must/As chimney sweepers come to dust."" and this epitaph by Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639), ""Upon the Death of Sir Albert Morton's Wife"": ""He first deceased; she for a little tried/To live without him, liked it not, and died."" (Barnet said, shortly after the death of his partner, that Wotton's lines came to his mind every day, and that he regretted, every day, his inability to re-enact them.) He leaves his sister-in-law Saretta Barnet, a niece and three nephews and their spouses, nine grandnephews and nieces, a great-grandnephew and niece, and his longtime friend, Morton Berman. Most of his estate was bequeathed to a scholarship fund at Tufts, in honor of his parents, Philip and Esther Barnet. By his wish there will be no services. 1/3"

2016-01-14T00:00:00Z,"PRESENT--Daniel H.,M.D. We at the Mount Sinai Health System are saddened by the passing of Daniel H. Present, M.D., a beloved physician who, in a five-decade career at Mount Sinai, was at the forefront of research into the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Dr. Present was the first researcher to show the effectiveness of an immunosuppressant, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), in fighting Crohn's disease. When Dr. Present published his results in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in 1980, it changed the lives of thousands of Crohn's patients. Later, he studied the use of cyclosporine for severe steroid- refractory ulcerative colitis, and demonstrated that it could help avoid or delay colectomies in many of these seriously ill patients. In a third breakthrough in the late 1990s, Dr. Present studied cA2, also known as infliximab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody, and showed, in another seminal paper in the NEJM, that it could help close fistulas in Crohn's patients. Early in his career at Mount Sinai, he was mentored by Henry D. Janowitz, M.D., for whom the Division of Gastroenterology is named. Dr. Present was also a talented clinician who cared for thousands of patients over his career. Over a decade ago, he and his wife, Jane, established an endowed fellowship at Mount Sinai to train graduates from outside institutions to become experts in the care of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Dr. and Mrs. Present also maintained a foundation for clinical research of IBD. Upon his retirement from Mount Sinai in 2014, the foundation donated its principal in support of The Susan and Leonard Feinstein Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinical Center at Mount Sinai. We extend our deepest sympathies to Jane and their children, Douglas, Stephanie, and Tracy, at this difficult time. Peter W. May, Chairman, Boards of Trustees, Mount Sinai Health System Kenneth L.

Clinical Professor of Medicine, Dr. Present combined an active clinical practice with prolific ground-breaking research in Gastroenterology. In the tradition of Drs. Crohn, Ginsberg, and Oppenheimer, he continued Mount Sinai's pioneering work in the study of inflammatory bowel diseases. Through his investigations, an important class of medications was added in treating Colitis and Crohn's Disease. He was awarded the prestigious Jacobi Medallion in 1991 and was a great supporter of the institution. A long term AAS board member, he served as President of the physicians' organization from 1979-1980. Dr. Present will be remembered for his outstanding contributions to the School and Hospital, and his commitment to excellence. His legacy will continue in the generations of students he taught and the many lives he touched. We extend condolences to his wife Jane and his entire family.

2016-01-14T00:00:00Z,"BARNET--Sylvan, born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 11, 1926, died at home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on January 9, 2016. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, then graduated from New York University (1948), Phi Beta Kappa, and entered the graduate program at Harvard (Ph.D. in English Language and Literature, 1954), where he wrote a prize-winning essay on Shakespeare. He spent his entire teaching career at Tufts University (1954-84), serving twice as chair of the Department of English. He published a number of essays in scholarly journals, a popular introduction to Shakespeare, and he served as General Editor of The Signet Classic Shakespeare, a paperback series (one play per volume) that is widely used in colleges and universities. He was also the author or co-author of several widely used textbooks-on argument (with Hugo Bedau, late of the Tufts Department of Philosophy), art, composition, drama, and literature, including ""A Short Guide to Writing about Art"" (now in its 11th edition), and ""Introduction to Literature"" (16th edition). In 1963, he and William Burto (his partner since 1952, deceased 2013) developed an interest in Japanese art, especially calligraphy, and they went on to build a collection that was exhibited in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Freer Gallery, the Harvard Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Art, Houston. The Metropolitan exhibition was accompanied by a catalog by Miyeko Murase, ""The Written Image"" (2002), to which Barnet and Burto contributed two essays, one on collecting, the other on looking at calligraphy from a Western point of view. (After Burto's death their collection was divided among the first four of these museums.) He and Burto also wrote ""Zen Ink Paintings"" (1982) as well as several essays on Japanese art. As a teacher of English literature, he was familiar with a good deal of writing about death. Among the favorite passages he carried in his head-he could not understand why some educators disparage ""rote memory""-were Shakespeare's ""Golden lads and girls all must/As chimney sweepers come to dust."" and this epitaph by Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639), ""Upon the Death of Sir Albert Morton's Wife"": ""He first deceased; she for a little tried/To live without him, liked it not, and died."" (Barnet said, shortly after the death of his partner, that Wotton's lines came to his mind every day, and that he regretted, every day, his inability to re-enact them.) He leaves his sister-in-law Saretta Barnet, a niece and three nephews and their spouses, nine grandnephews and nieces, a great-grandnephew and niece, and his longtime friend, Morton Berman. Most of his estate was bequeathed to a scholarship fund at Tufts, in honor of his parents, Philip and Esther Barnet. By his wish there will be no services. 1/3"

Present, born April 3, 1934, passed away on January 12th from complication of Parkinson's Disease. He was 81 years old. His passing will be deeply mourned by Jane Werner Present, his wife, partner, lover and best friend of more than 59 years, his three children, their spouses, and four grandchildren, Tracy Present, Stephanie, Michael, Billy and Katherine Podalak, Douglas, Susan, Adam and Margot Present, and his sister Judy Present Liss; his friends, associates and the thousands of lives he touched during his 50 years of practice. Dan graduated from Syracuse University Magna Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa in 1955 and State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine, Magna Cum Laude, in 1959. He completed an internship, medical residency, Gastroenterology residency and GI Fellowship at Mt. Sinai Hospital, and entered private practice in 1964, where he quickly began to focus his attention on the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. He was the recipient of the first research award given by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Dan brought clinical trials into clinical practice. His first paper was accepted for publication in 1966. He subsequently published 329 papers. At the time of his retirement, his publications had been cited more than 15,000 times. During his 54 years at Mt. Sinai, he served as President of both the Association of the Attending Staff and the Alumni Association for which he received the coveted Jacobi Medallion for Conspicuous Service to the Alumni. Dan received every award in his field including the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine Distinguished Service Award, The American Gastroenterology Association Distinguished Clinician Award, Master of the American College of Gastroenterology, The WiIIiam Dock, M.D. Master Teacher Award in Medicine State University of New York, the Janssen Award for Outstanding Achievement Award in Clinical Gastroenterology, the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Lifetime Achievement Award and the George Arents Award for Excellence in Medicine, the highest achievement awarded by Syracuse University. He is generally recognized as having pioneered the way Crohn's disease is treated. More than any recognition, Dan loved taking care of his patients. He loved them and they returned that love many times over. His joy came from sparing his patients the pain, discomfort, and humiliation of inflammatory bowel disease by finding the right combination of medications and thoughtful creativity. He fought against surgery if there was a possible medical solution. He talked with his patients for many more hours than any HMO wouId have allowed. He sat at their bedside and visited them late at night, he celebrated when they felt better. Nothing made him happier than a college student being able to return to school, or a young adult feeling well enough to plan a wedding or bear a child. He loved teaching young Gastroenterologists and, along with a grateful patient, created the Present-Levison fourth year fellowship in Clinical GI, which allowed the brightest young men and women to spend a post-graduate year learning clinical GI at Mt. Sinai. These fellows now care for IBD patients all over the world. Funeral services will be held on Thursday at 12pm at ""The Riverside,"" 180 West 76th St., New York.

Mary's life was most remarkable for the effect she had on the people around her. She brought light and laughter to every room she entered. A rock of comfort and support for anyone grieving or feeling lonely, Mary loved to laugh and make others laugh, play games, cook, and spend time with friends. She loved her dogs, the mountains, music, boating, reading, and traveling. But most of all, she loved her husband, John, her son, Ike, and her daughter, Lindsey. For those fortunate enough to have met her, Mary will be remembered as one of the warmest and most thoughtful people the world has known. Generous and welcoming, she opened her home to everyone-friends and strangers alike-who needed a home-cooked meal or a safe haven. She was fiercely loyal to and supportive of those close to her and kind to everyone she met. Mary's family takes comfort in the knowledge that her legacy lives on through the immeasurable impact she had on others. While the joy and laughter that her memories evoke pale in comparison to her radiant physical presence, they ensure that she will never be forgotten. It is Mary's family's hope that all who knew her will honor her memory by striving to treat others with the grace and kindness that she did. It was the size of Mary's heart that made the world a better place. A celebration of Mary's life will be held at 5pm on Saturday, January 23, at Baltimore Country Club at Five Farms, 11500 Mays Chapel Road, Lutherville, MD 21093. All friends are welcome. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Mary's name to Dyslexia Tutoring Program (dyslexiatutoringprogram.org).

2016-01-17T00:00:00Z,"PERRY--Susan M.,66, died on January 10, 2016 of brain cancer. Sue loved sailing, the Yankees, great music and New York City. Born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin on July 19, 1949, Sue grew up in Wauwatosa and graduated from Wauwatosa West High School. She earned a B.S. in English and secondary education from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and an M.A. in English from the University of Maine. She completed coursework for a doctorate in rhetoric and composition from the University of Rhode Island. Sue worked in New York as a copy supervisor at Wishbone/ITP, as a senior copywriter at Saatchi and Saatchi Healthcare Advertising, and as a writer and medical editor for Cline Davis and Mann. She taught a variety of courses at Iona College and at The Portfolio Center in Atlanta. She began her career writing copy at WTMJ in Milwaukee. Sue treasured her nieces and nephews-Wallis and Arthur Perry; Lisa Manon and her daughter Sahsheem Davis; Jennifer Manon, Josh Bardfield and their daughters Sadie and Uma; Jesse Schmidt, Katie Barnes Schmidt and their son Grady; Darren Schmidt and Sunita Kurra; Mary Catharine, Rory and Hannah Gillick; Molly Horstman and Raphael Gang; Terry Horstman; and Patrick Perry and his daughter Ashlynn-and they adored her in return.

They and Sue's many friends will deeply miss her quick, irreverent wit, her insistence on proper grammar and her uncanny ability to make everyone feel as if they were her favorite. Sue's mother Mary Sullivan Perry died in 1960, her father Wally in 1989, and her sister Barbara in 2001. Plans for a memorial celebration in Milwaukee are pending. Donations suggested to the Sojourner Family Peace Center or Midwest Athletes Against Childhood Cancer (MACC Fund), both of Milwaukee. 1/3"
2016-01-17T00:00:00Z,"MANUS--Morton. President of Alfred Music, passed away at his Los Angeles home on January 9 after a battle with cancer. He was a devoted husband to his wife Iris, a loving father and grandfather, an innovative music publisher, a celebrated author, an inspiring mentor to his staff, and a dedicated friend. Morty was a great man. Born in 1926 in New York to Russian immigrants Samuel and Ann, Morty proudly enlisted in the Air Force during WWII, received a business degree from The City College of New York, and in the late 1940s, joined his father in the family business, Alfred Music. When Morty started working at Alfred Music, there were four employees: Morty's father Sam, a picker, a packer, and a bookkeeper. The important part of this story is Rose, the bookkeeper, who had a daughter named Iris. Morty and Iris fell in love, and as they say, the rest is history. They were married over 60 years. Alfred Music began in New York's Tin Pan Alley in 1922 and focused on mood music for silent films. Inspired by the need for quality music education products, Morty, a pianist, clarinetist, and guitarist, reinvented the company in the 1950s. He oversaw the development of an instructional series for accordion, followed by similar publications for guitar, piano, and recorder. Morty is the author and editor of hundreds of titles in Alfred Music's catalog, including the enormously popular series, Alfred's Basic Guitar Method and Alfred's Basic Piano Library. When Alfred Music outgrew its New York headquarters in the mid-1970s, Morty and Iris moved the company to Los Angeles. As time went by, they split their time between New York and Los Angeles, having many close friends on both coasts. The company continued to grow under Morty's leadership. Morty was joined in the business by his son Ron in 1988 and his son Steven in 1992. The family business expanded into the world's leading instructional music publisher with offices in Australia, Germany, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. In 2005, Alfred Music purchased Warner Bros. Print Publications. Morty received an honorary Doctorate of Music from VanderCook College of Music in July of 2008. Morty and Iris continued to be deeply committed to music education by supporting many music scholarships, competitions, and organizations. Morty had many hobbies including being an avid sports fan, rooting for the Lakers and Dodgers. He was also a keen investor, skilled at stock charting and analysis. Among Morty's other great accomplishments was climbing Mount Washington, New Hampshire on several occasions. He would often remark to his companions during the climb, ""You will tell your grandchildren about this."" Though terribly saddened by their loss, the Manus family members are now focusing on celebrating his life and the bright light of his legacy. Thanks to his amazing life's work, generations of music makers will continue to experience the joy of making music. Morty and Iris recently summed up their love for music education and Alfred Music with these words: ""Working a lifetime with Music and Musicians was not always milk and honey, but it was as close to heaven on earth as we could get."" Morty is survived by his wife Iris; his three sons Steven (wife Sylvie), Scott, and Ron (partner Renee); his three granddaughters Alexandra, Samantha, and Melissandra; and his brother-in-law Jay Kopelman (wife Sherry).

2016-01-17T00:00:00Z,"de SIMONE--Lillian Imundo. Beloved mother, teacher and friend, passed away peacefully on January 6, 2016, after a long illness. She was at home, surrounded by her three daughters. Her charm, intelligence and wit enriched the lives of all who knew her. Born and raised in the Bronx, NY, she worked in the personnel department at the Revlon company's headquarters, and helped her brother Rico establish the New Dimension Theatre in Oradell, NJ. In the 1970's as a divorced mother of three, she entered Ramapo College, earned her bachelor's degree and then began her long, rewarding career in education. She taught drama, public speaking, English and literature at Emerson High School for 27 years, helping generations of students to find meaning in stories, to make sense of the world and to find their own voices. Beloved by her students, she was voted favorite teacher by more than a dozen senior classes. Over the years, she shared her love of travel and all things Italian with students she led on trips to Italy. She took joy in the rich process of education and was a lifelong learner herself. From the most recent archeological discovery to finding a new jazz standard; from cooking a favorite meal to alerting the family to a special moonrise, her curiosity and enthusiasm was a joy for all around her. She will be remembered for her laugh, her love of life and her fierce courage of the heart. Lillian was the youngest child of Filomena Volino Imundo and Rocco Imundo, and was predeceased by her siblings Ann, Louis, Rose and Rico. She is survived by her daughters Renata Simone of Marblehead, MA, Lauren de Simone and Stephanie Sanders of Ridgewood, NJ, and her granddaughters Lily and Roxanne Sanders.

Mary's life was most remarkable for the effect she had on the people around her. She brought light and laughter to every room she entered. A rock of comfort and support for anyone grieving or feeling lonely, Mary loved to laugh and make others laugh, play games, cook, and spend time with friends. She loved her dogs, the mountains, music, boating, reading, and traveling. But most of all, she loved her husband, John, her son, Ike, and her daughter, Lindsey. For those fortunate enough to have met her, Mary will be remembered as one of the warmest and most thoughtful people the world has known. Generous and welcoming, she opened her home to everyone-friends and strangers alike-who needed a home-cooked meal or a safe haven. She was fiercely loyal to and supportive of those close to her and kind to everyone she met. Mary's family takes comfort in the knowledge that her legacy lives on through the immeasurable impact she had on others. While the joy and laughter that her memories evoke pale in comparison to her radiant physical presence, they ensure that she will never be forgotten. It is Mary's family's hope that all who knew her will honor her memory by striving to treat others with the grace and kindness that she did.

2016-01-17T00:00:00Z,"LIEBER--Constance E. March 2, 1924 - January 15, 2016. Constance Lieber transformed her family's experience with significant mental illness into a life suffused with meaning, purpose, and extraordinary effectiveness. Few people could imagine the breadth and depth of her interests, ranging from the most creative modern art to inspiring architecture, exhilarating music, and insightful studies of neuroscience and human behavior. Guided by her compassion, dedication, and curiosity - as well as her personal relationships with scores of leading psychiatrists and neuroscientists - Constance informally advised thousands of parents who were desperately seeking better treatments and cures for their mentally ill children. During their sixty-five year marriage, Constance and her husband Stephen A. Lieber shared enduring love and intense intellectual insights to transform the field of basic and clinical research into the origins of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Since 1980, Constance and Steve have been among the leading public advocates and philanthropic supporters of schizophrenia and depression research in the US and around the globe. Their efforts included the creation of significant clinical and scientific institutions to support emerging discoveries in the fields of biological psychiatry and patient services. For over twenty-five years, they gave exemplary leadership to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (formerly NARSAD), the world's largest private funder of mental health research. Constance served as President from 1989 to 2007. In 2014, their activities were honored by the American Psychiatric Association with a Special Presidential Commendation, stating ""Constance and Steve have provided unwavering moral and material support to unravel the mysteries of the brain, and to better understand and treat mental illness."" In 1987, the Liebers established an annual award for outstanding achievements in schizophrenia research. To date, two Lieber Prize winners have gone on to win Nobel Prizes. At Columbia University, they founded two centers of excellence - the Lieber Recovery and Rehabilitation Clinic for Psychotic Disorders and the Lieber Schizophrenic Clinic. At Williams College, they were the founders of the undergraduate neuroscience program. In 2011, they created the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, affiliated with the Johns Hopkins University, to integrate new discoveries in developmental neurobiology and genetics in order to achieve clinical advances that can change lives. Constance was a graduate of Brooklyn College and attended Columbia University for her post-graduate studies. She received honorary doctorates from Williams College and Brooklyn College. She received over two dozen awards to recognize her outstanding leadership, including: the Brooke Astor Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Advancement of Science, the Women in Science Award from The Rockefeller University, the Distinguished Service Award from the Yale University's Department of Psychiatry, and the Humanitarian Award from the Society of Biological Psychiatry. Survivors include her beloved husband Stephen, her children Janice and Sam (Mary Rubin), her devoted grandson, her sister Beverly, and several nieces and nephews.

Present, born April 3, 1934, passed away on January 12th from complication of Parkinson's Disease. He was 81 years old. His passing will be deeply mourned by Jane Werner Present, his wife, partner, lover and best friend of more than 59 years, his three children, their spouses, and four grandchildren, Tracy Present, Stephanie, Michael, Billy and Katherine Podalak, Douglas, Susan, Adam and Margot Present, and his sister Judy Present Liss; his friends, associates and the thousands of lives he touched during his 50 years of practice. Dan graduated from Syracuse University Magna Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa in 1955 and State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine, Magna Cum Laude, in 1959. He completed an internship, medical residency, Gastroenterology residency and GI Fellowship at Mt. Sinai Hospital, and entered private practice in 1964, where he quickly began to focus his attention on the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. He was the recipient of the first research award given by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Dan brought clinical trials into clinical practice. His first paper was accepted for publication in 1966. He subsequently published 329 papers. At the time of his retirement, his publications had been cited more than 15,000 times. During his 54 years at Mt. Sinai, he served as President of both the Association of the Attending Staff and the Alumni Association for which he received the coveted Jacobi Medallion for Conspicuous Service to the Alumni. Dan received every award in his field including the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine Distinguished Service Award, The American Gastroenterology Association Distinguished Clinician Award, Master of the American College of Gastroenterology, The WiIIiam Dock, M.D. Master Teacher Award in Medicine State University of New York, the Janssen Award for Outstanding Achievement Award in Clinical Gastroenterology, the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Lifetime Achievement Award and the George Arents Award for Excellence in Medicine, the highest achievement awarded by Syracuse University. He is generally recognized as having pioneered the way Crohn's disease is treated. More than any recognition, Dan loved taking care of his patients. He loved them and they returned that love many times over. His joy came from sparing his patients the pain, discomfort, and humiliation of inflammatory bowel disease by finding the right combination of medications and thoughtful creativity. He fought against surgery if there was a possible medical solution. He talked with his patients for many more hours than any HMO wouId have allowed. He sat at their bedside and visited them late at night, he celebrated when they felt better. Nothing made him happier than a college student being able to return to school, or a young adult feeling well enough to plan a wedding or bear a child. He loved teaching young Gastroenterologists and, along with a grateful patient, created the Present-Levison fourth year fellowship in Clinical GI, which allowed the brightest young men and women to spend a post-graduate year learning clinical GI at Mt. Sinai. These fellows now care for IBD patients all over the world. Contributions in Dan's memory may be made to the Present-Levison Fellowship at Mt.

2016-01-18T00:00:00Z,"LIEBER--Constance E. March 2, 1924 - January 15, 2016. Constance Lieber transformed her family's experience with significant mental illness into a life suffused with meaning, purpose, and extraordinary effectiveness. Few people could imagine the breadth and depth of her interests, ranging from the most creative modern art to inspiring architecture, exhilarating music, and insightful studies of neuroscience and human behavior. Guided by her compassion, dedication, and curiosity - as well as her personal relationships with scores of leading psychiatrists and neuroscientists - Constance informally advised thousands of parents who were desperately seeking better treatments and cures for their mentally ill children. During their sixty-five year marriage, Constance and her husband Stephen A. Lieber shared enduring love and intense intellectual insights to transform the field of basic and clinical research into the origins of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Since 1980, Constance and Steve have been among the leading public advocates and philanthropic supporters of schizophrenia and depression research in the US and around the globe. Their efforts included the creation of significant clinical and scientific institutions to support emerging discoveries in the fields of biological psychiatry and patient services. For over twenty-five years, they gave exemplary leadership to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (formerly NARSAD), the world's largest private funder of mental health research. Constance served as President from 1989 to 2007. In 2014, their activities were honored by the American Psychiatric Association with a Special Presidential Commendation, stating ""Constance and Steve have provided unwavering moral and material support to unravel the mysteries of the brain, and to better understand and treat mental illness."" In 1987, the Liebers established an annual award for outstanding achievements in schizophrenia research. To date, two Lieber Prize winners have gone on to win Nobel Prizes. At Columbia University, they founded two centers of excellence - the Lieber Recovery and Rehabilitation Clinic for Psychotic Disorders and the Lieber Schizophrenic Clinic. At Williams College, they were the founders of the undergraduate neuroscience program. In 2011, they created the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, affiliated with the Johns Hopkins University, to integrate new discoveries in developmental neurobiology and genetics in order to achieve clinical advances that can change lives. Constance was a graduate of Brooklyn College and attended Columbia University for her post-graduate studies. She received honorary doctorates from Williams College and Brooklyn College. She received over two dozen awards to recognize her outstanding leadership, including: the Brooke Astor Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Advancement of Science, the Women in Science Award from The Rockefeller University, the Distinguished Service Award from the Yale University's Department of Psychiatry, and the Humanitarian Award from the Society of Biological Psychiatry. Survivors include her beloved husband Stephen, her children Janice and Sam (Mary Rubin), her devoted grandson, her sister Beverly, and several nieces and nephews. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her honor to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, 90 Park Avenue, 16th Floor, New York, New York 10016. A service will be held at Larchmont Temple, 75 Larchmont Avenue, on Tuesday, January 19th at 11:30am. Burial will be private. The family will receive visitors at the family home in Mamaroneck on Wednesday and Thursday from seven to nine o'clock in the evening.

As the owner of a manufacturing business, he had clients throughout the City and watched neighborhoods change. He remembered horse drawn carriages filled the street and veterans of the Civil War parading in their uniforms on Memorial Day. His father survived the 1918 influenza and his uncle was gassed in World War I. Dad received an excellent public school education and graduated with highest honors from his high school while working for the Brooklyn Eagle covering sports. He entered Columbia in 1928 but to his great regret, had to leave to contribute to the support of his family. He made up for this perceived shortcoming by visiting libraries and museums. He became a connoisseur of drawings and paintings with a small collection. His deep commitment to the City was expressed in community service. Our father was the longest serving trustee of Congregation Emanu-El; he chaired many of its committees and he and our mother endowed its museum of Judaica. They were both actively involved in a number of charitable organizations. For Dad it included Montefiore Medical Center and UJA-Federation. He also was particularly proud of his service to his industry. For many years he was a board member of the Paperboard Packaging Council and served a term as its non-executive President. In addition to us he is survived by grandchildren, Geoffrey Dann, Deborah Fields, Adam Bernard and Claire Bernard, and great-grandchildren, Rebecca Dann, Emily Dann, and Lion Bernard De Rham.

He entered Columbia in 1928 but to his great regret, had to leave to contribute to the support of his family. He made up for this perceived shortcoming by visiting libraries and museums. He became a connoisseur of drawings and paintings with a small collection. His deep commitment to the City was expressed in community service. Our father was the longest serving trustee of Congregation Emanu-El; he chaired many of its committees and he and our mother endowed its museum of Judaica. They were both actively involved in a number of charitable organizations. For Dad it included Montefiore Medical Center and UJA-Federation. He also was particularly proud of his service to his industry. For many years he was a board member of the Paperboard Packaging Council and served a term as its non-executive President. In addition to us he is survived by grandchildren, Geoffrey Dann, Deborah Fields, Adam Bernard and Claire Bernard, and great-grandchildren, Rebecca Dann, Emily Dann, and Lion Bernard De Rham. There will be a private family funeral service. Contributions in his honor may be made to the Herbert and Eileen Bernard Museum Judaica Fund at Congregation Emanu-El.

2016-01-19T00:00:00Z,"GARIBALDI--Justice Marie L.,of Weehawken, NJ, passed on January 15, 2016. Justice Garibaldi was born November 26, 1934, in Jersey City to Dr. Louis and Marie S. Garibaldi. As an only child, she lived most of her life in Hudson County. The Garibaldis raised their daughter with a strong belief in equal opportunity for women and encouraged her to pursue a nontraditional career path. She was a pioneer and role model to so many. She is survived by loving cousins, adoring godchildren and many cherished friends and colleagues. As a child, Justice Garibaldi attended Stevens Hoboken Academy through 12th grade. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors in economics and a political science minor from Connecticut College (New London, CT) in 1956. With an intent to follow in her grandfather's footsteps and attend business school, Justice Garibaldi learned first-hand women weren't accepted. Instead, she enrolled in Columbia Law School as a pathway into the business world and graduated in 1959. In 1963, Justice Garibaldi earned her Master of Laws degree in tax law from New York University School of Law. She was a member of the New Jersey, New York, and District of Columbia Bars and the first woman to serve as president of the New Jersey State Bar Association. Justice Garibaldi began her legal career with the New York Regional Counsel in the Internal Revenue Service. She received extensive trial experience in Tax Court. The Hatch Act restricted government employees from political speech-making and article-writing which ultimately caused Justice Garibaldi to make her next career move. She briefly worked at a firm now known as Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti (Riker, Danzig)-within three years she was made a partner which was virtually unheard of at that time. While at Riker, Danzig, Justice Garibaldi also served as a municipal court judge in Weehawken, NJ, from 1973 to 1975, writing the majority of opinion in several cases affecting women. Justice Garibaldi was introduced to Republican Thomas H. Kean by a Riker, Danzig partner. This ultimately led Justice Garibaldi to serve as co-chair of his gubernatorial campaign. Once elected, Governor Thomas H. Kean nominated Justice Garibaldi to the New Jersey Supreme Court. In 1982, Justice Garibaldi became the first woman appointed to the New Jersey Supreme Court- she served as Associate Justice of New Jersey's highest court until she retired in 2000. She authored more than 225 opinions while on the Supreme Court and was known for her advocacy of complementary dispute resolution. She chaired the Supreme Court's committee on that subject, and in 1998, the American Inns of Court Foundation established the Justice Marie L. Garibaldi American Inn of Court for Alternative Dispute Resolution. Justice Garibaldi was the recipient of many awards, including the Medal of Excellence from the Columbia University School of Law. She received honorary degrees from St. John's University Law School, Seton Hall University Law School, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Drew University, Upsala College, St. Peter's College, Caldwell College, and the College of Saint Elizabeth. Justice Garibaldi joined the Hackensack University Medical Center in 2001 and served as vice chair of Hackensack University Medical Center's Board of Governors. She also served on the Hackensack University Health Network's Board of Trustees, as chair of the Executive Compensation Committee and on the Hackensack University Medical Center Foundation's Board of Trustees. She chaired the Hudson Riverfront Performing Arts Center and served as a member of the Board of Directors of the National Italian American Foundation. Justice Garibaldi also served as a director of Crown Holdings, Inc. from 2000 to 2007. She also served as a member of the New Jersey Council on Local Mandates. In addition, Justice Garibaldi served as the secretary of the American Association Order of Malta, USA and executive vice president of the American Society of the Italian Legions of Merit. She also served as a director of the State Chamber of Commerce, New Jersey Bell Telephone Co., and the Washington Savings Bank. She also was a trustee of St. Peter's College. Justice Garibaldi truly enjoyed traveling, reading mysteries, and dinner and dancing with friends. She will be greatly missed by friends, loved ones and colleagues. Justice Marie L. Garibaldi was predeceased by her parents-her father, Dr. Louis Garibaldi passed away in 1975 and her mother, Marie S. Garibaldi passed away in 2013 at the age of 103. The funeral will be on Thursday, January 21 at 9am from the Leber Funeral Home in Union City then to St. Augustine Church where, at 10am, a Mass will be offered. Visitation will be on Tuesday, January 19 from 7 to 9pm, Wednesday, January 20 from 2 to 5pm and 7 to 9pm.

Ades, a successful entrepreneur and deeply committed philanthropist who was a great friend to MSM and an influential force for progress at the School. A Trustee Emeritus who served as a member of the School's Board of Trustees for 21 years between 1990 and 2011, Mr. Ades, along with his wife Joan Taub Ades, made many profound contributions to MSM over the years, ensuring the School's advancement as one of the world's leading independent music conservatories. In addition to his important service as a member of MSM's Board, Mr. Ades' stewardship was reflected in his active commitment to the many MSM committees of which he was a member and by the generous leadership contributions he and Mrs. Ades made to the School, often by way of the Joan and Alan Ades-Taub Family Foundation. Many of Mr. Ades' most significant contributions to MSM were guided by his love of opera (he also served as a director at the Met Opera and Santa Fe Opera). In addition to providing generous support to MSM scholarships for classical vocalists, the Ades Family Foundation established and continues to fund the School's prestigious Alan M. and Joan Taub Ades Vocal Competition, an annual event that is judged by an esteemed panel of opera professionals and awards significant cash prizes to winning students. Perhaps most significant, Mr. and Mrs. Ades led the capital campaign for, and ultimately named, one of MSM's key performance and rehearsal spaces, an indispensable, flexible black-box space that not only accommodates full-scale opera and orchestral rehearsals, but also seats audiences of up to 200 for a wide variety of performances. This key addition to MSM's facility-the Alan M. and Joan Taub Ades Performance Space-opened its doors in 2007 and stands as a lively testament to the visionary leadership and generosity made to MSM by this prominent leader in business and philanthropy and his wife, Joan Taub Ades. Our Board of Trustees, Administration, Faculty, Alumni, and Current Students are united in expressing the MSM Community's sorrow at the passing of this singular individual. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Ades, whose continuing friendship we so highly cherish, and to the Ades family; we know that Alan's long, rich, accomplished life and the many wonderful memories it inspires will be a source of comfort and joy in the days and years ahead.

2016-01-22T00:00:00Z,"DAYTON--Robert. Robert Dayton, whose career spanned decades in support of a vibrant downtown Minneapolis, MN, died on January 17th. He was 73 years old. A great-grandson of the founder of Daytons, Bob carried on the family retail and community-oriented legacy. After graduating from Yale in 1964, Bob joined what was to become Dayton Hudson and then Target, rising to become General Merchandise Manager and then Vice President of Stores. While with Daytons, Bob attended the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School. A merchandiser at heart, Bob became recognized for his deftness in identifying and supporting designers such as Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren early in their careers. In 1977 Bob left Daytons and purchased Harold, an upscale specialty store for women. Working together with his wife Joanie, Bob restored its iconic status as a Minneapolis retail institution. In 1984 Bob spearheaded the development of The Conservatory, the first enclosed shopping complex in Minneapolis. Throughout his career Bob advocated for a thriving downtown and worked to strengthen the Twin Cities as a major league community through efforts to bring Superbowl XXVI to Minneapolis, keep the Timberwolves, and secure funding for a new outdoor Twins stadium. Bob served on several corporate boards including Northwestern National Bank, First American Funds, and Williams Sonoma. In 1992 Bob became CEO of Okabena, helping transform the Dayton family office into a nationally recognized leader in the then-nascent family office industry. Fiercely loyal to and enormously proud of the people and places he loved, Bob was committed to serving his community. He worked tirelessly on behalf of many non-profits including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Abbott Northwestern Hospital, the United Way, and Westminster Presbyterian Church. In addition, Bob served as a Trustee of the Blake School, Carlton College, and the University of Minnesota Foundation. In 1994 Bob founded and was later named Chair Emeritus of the Mentoring Partnership of Minnesota. Bob grew up in Wayzata, Minnesota and attended Blake, Eaglebrook, and Taft. While at Yale, Bob met his wife Joanie, then attending Skidmore College, on a blind date at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival. They were married in 1964 and had three boys. Bob enjoyed a number of hobbies, but none more so than golf. Beginning at Woodhill Country Club, his passion eventually extended east to Pine Valley and west to Cypress Point. He cofounded Spring Hill Golf Club and enjoyed playing in the U.S. Seniors. Bob will always be remembered for his warm heart, wonderful smile, infectious laughter, fantastic sense of humor, and tremendous spirit. He is survived by Joanie, his wife of 51 years, two brothers, three sons, and seven grandchildren.

2016-01-22T00:00:00Z,"ZIELENZIGER--Dr. Ruth, who helped change how Conservative Jews in America are taught the Bible, and inspired some of Israel's most enduring poetry of love while a young woman, died Thursday at the RiverWalk independent living facility of the Hebrew Home in the Bronx, one day shy of her 93rd birthday. Awarded her Doctorate of Hebrew Literature at age 66, Dr. Zielenziger was instrumental in creating the curriculum for teaching the books of Genesis and Exodus in Conservative Judaism at the Melton Research Center of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. The Melton program emphasized critical inquiry and the study of Bible for character education. She was a proponent of studying the creation myths and texts of other Middle Eastern cultures in order to better understand the context in which the Bible was written. Born in London, the daughter of Leo and Lola Herrmann, ardent Zionists, she grew up in Jerusalem before the founding of the Jewish state, and served as an ambulance driver and chauffeur in the British Army during World War II, where her fluency in Hebrew, English and German was invaluable. After the War, she attended the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where she met a German emigre and fellow student, Yehuda Pfeuffer, whom she renamed Yehuda Amichai. Amichai went on to become Israel's most celebrated poet, and the first drafts of many of his most enduring poems were composed as letters exchanged between the two. Amichai's letters to Dr. Zielenziger are now archived at Ben Gurion University in Israel. She moved to New York in 1947, to study at the Teachers Institute of the Seminary. While in New York she met and subsequently married Eric W. Zielenziger, a German Jewish survivor of the Holocaust who escaped the Nazis by living underground in Amsterdam for more than two years. They had two children. For 34 years, Dr. Zielenziger taught education at the Jewish Theological Seminary, after teaching for many years in Hebrew schools in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. Before relocating to Riverdale in their later years the Zielenzigers lived primarily in Freeport and Great Neck, NY. She is survived by her sons David, of Great Neck, and Michael (Diane Abt) of Oakland, CA and Manhattan and a brother, Dr. Gabriel Herrmann of Jerusalem. Services will be held Friday at 11am at Riverside Nassau North, 55 N. Station Plaza, Great Neck, NY. 1/3"

Throughout his career Bob advocated for a thriving downtown and worked to strengthen the Twin Cities as a major league community through efforts to bring Superbowl XXVI to Minneapolis, keep the Timberwolves, and secure funding for a new outdoor Twins stadium. Bob served on several corporate boards including Northwestern National Bank, First American Funds, and Williams Sonoma. In 1992 Bob became CEO of Okabena, helping transform the Dayton family office into a nationally recognized leader in the then-nascent family office industry. Fiercely loyal to and enormously proud of the people and places he loved, Bob was committed to serving his community. He worked tirelessly on behalf of many non-profits including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Abbott Northwestern Hospital, the United Way, and Westminster Presbyterian Church. In addition, Bob served as a Trustee of the Blake School, Carlton College, and the University of Minnesota Foundation. In 1994 Bob founded and was later named Chair Emeritus of the Mentoring Partnership of Minnesota. Bob grew up in Wayzata, Minnesota and attended Blake, Eaglebrook, and Taft. While at Yale, Bob met his wife Joanie, then attending Skidmore College, on a blind date at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival. They were married in 1964 and had three boys. Bob enjoyed a number of hobbies, but none more so than golf. Beginning at Woodhill Country Club, his passion eventually extended east to Pine Valley and west to Cypress Point. He cofounded Spring Hill Golf Club and enjoyed playing in the U.S. Seniors. Bob will always be remembered for his warm heart, wonderful smile, infectious laughter, fantastic sense of humor, and tremendous spirit. He is survived by Joanie, his wife of 51 years, two brothers, three sons, and seven grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on February 18th at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis. 1/3"

2016-01-24T00:00:00Z,"VAN NESS--John R.,known as ""Jack,"" 70, of Ossining, NY, died peacefully with his wife at his side, January 19, 2016, at Rosary Hill Home after a short, courageous struggle with cancer. Jack was born in New York City, December 24, 1945, later preferring to tell folks he grew up on a small island off the coast of New Jersey. He studied at Stephens Institute of Technology and later earned his BS degree at Long Island University. Taking pre-med courses, he planned to follow in the footsteps of his deceased father, who was a NYC physician. All that changed when he took a summer job at Thomas J. Lipton company where he discovered the many faceted world of food science. His enthusiasm for food science never diminished. During his 20 year corporate career, he worked at a number of leading food companies including Best Food and Chesebrough Ponds. He gained experienced in every aspect of food processing, plant production, food safety, product development and federal filing regulations and practices. He was a trained taster who could recognize the individual spices in any combination presented, much to the surprise of restaurant chefs, a number of whom he advised and befriended over the years. As his career evolved, his focus centered on canned foods and he became one of New York's foremost food processing authorities. As such, he was a consultant who was recognized and worked with the United States Department of Agriculture and food processing. An avid sailor and scuba diver since his teens, Jack left the corporate world behind to sail from New York City to the Caribbean with a sailor buddy, exploring practically every island there during their six month cruise. Soon after his return, he formed his own company, Van Ness Food Technologies, which he operated while living aboard his 37 foot sailboat, ""Cruzin,"" docked at City Island, NY. In 1992, he found ""the love he had been waiting for"" when he met Carolyn, another enthusiastic scuba diver. They married in 2001 aboard a yacht in New York harbor. Throughout their years together, they traveled the world, lured by possible dive adventures in the Caribbean, Bora Bora, Europe, Mexico and the Red Sea. One of Jack's favorite sea stories was about his transatlantic sail aboard a 42 foot sailboat from Bermuda to Malaga, Spain. ""Sailing across the Pond is on every sailor's bucket list and I couldn't be happier or more satisfied because I got to do it,"" said Jack. Jack loved being with friends and sharing sea stories based on his experiences sailing with Carolyn up and down Long Island Sound, always on the lookout for a new raft up spot and seafood restaurant. For almost 30 years, Jack's consulting business worked with international clients in Canada, Greece, Israel and Korea. He was a featured lecturer at the First Food Safety Conference held in Bangalore, India, where he taught Indian food scientists how to implement Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point safety principles. Jack was a hands on expert who knew how to build and manage a food plant from its conception to the time the canned food product was on the pallet ready to go to market. He was known for his strong sense of integrity and absolute dedication to ensuring the safety of any food product under his production management. He was a charter member of IFTPS, participating in annual food conferences in the US and abroad. Jack was more than generous in passing along his wealth of knowledge to his many clients, interspersed with updates about his latest sailing or diving adventures. His genuine enjoyment of life was contagious. It enabled Jack to engage in lively conversations and make friends with young and old alike. With the wind at his back, he has charted his course, leaving us with memories of an unforgettable personality, sharp wit, brilliant mind and smile. Besides his beloved wife, Carolyn, he leaves behind a worldwide group of business associates and longtime friends, whose many lives he touched. At his request, his ashes are to be scattered over the area waters that gave him so much pleasure. There will be a celebration of Jack's life during the coming sailing season. 1/3"
2016-01-24T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON--Bryan R.,professor of late 19th and 20th century American literature and cultural studies, and a man of considerable wit, humor, style, elegance, and charm, with a passion for the beauty and joy of some of life's most abundant and finest offerings, died of cancer on December 31, 2015. He was 57. The son of Dr. Joseph R. Washington, Jr. and the late Sophia M. Washington, Bryan was born in Boston, Massachusetts. During his formative years, Bryan lived in numerous towns and cities in Wisconsin, Virginia, California, and Pennsylvania, where he attended the University of Pennsylvania. At UPenn, Bryan was a Benjamin Franklin Scholar; he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree (with honors) in General Literature in 1980. UPenn served as a catalyst for Bryan's graduate studies, which led him to complete his Master's Degree in English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford University in 1982 through Penn's Thouron Award, a British-American exchange program. Bryan received his second Master's Degree in English and American Language at Harvard University in 1985. He was also a Minority Prize Fellow from 1982-1987. Bryan received his Ph.D. in English and American Literature and Language from Harvard in 1989. Bryan launched his academic career as an instructor at Lafayette College in 1987 and was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1989. He served as a Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University from 1991-1992. In 1994, Bryan was promoted to Associate Professor with full tenure. Bryan's scholarly work includes the publication of a book entitled ""The Politics of Exile: The Ideology in Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and James Baldwin"" in 1995. The book was well received and widely cited. It is considered by many to be one of the first works to position James Baldwin alongside white canonical American authors. Bryan also authored several articles and reviews, including: ""Paris Blues(s),"" an essay on James Baldwin; and ""WASP Mischief: Martha Stewart and the Racial Status Quo."" He was in the process of writing two books before he became ill. Throughout his career at Lafayette, which spanned over a quarter century, Bryan received numerous honors, including the Student Government Superior Teaching Award in 1989-1990 and 1992-1993, which is rare for a professor to receive twice. Bryan delivered presentations at Lafayette on topics such as ""Blacks in Popular Culture"" and ""Black Writers in the Classroom."" In May 2014, Bryan delivered ""The Last Lecture"" to graduating seniors; this was, sadly, Bryan's last lecture and last professional engagement. The title of the lecture was: ""In the Course of It All: Life is Words;"" this honor, along with the two student government teaching awards, suggests how deeply he was loved by his students- his courses were always over-enrolled. Students described him as inspiring, exciting, funny, and extremely smart. Bryan once described his teaching in the following terms: ""If asked what I aim to accomplish in the classroom, I would say I am trying for a good conversation. For in all my courses dialogue is a primary emphasis. I enjoy lecturing, but my class presentations, generally, are designed to provoke dissuasion. Whether just beginning college work or about to finish, undergraduates (I believe) have something to teach me."" As a resident of Doylestown, PA, Bryan's life included jazz and the American songbook as a joy, metaphor and interpretation of his many passions: writing, literary criticism, food, art, ""beautiful things,"" and, of course, Paris. During evenings, he would often play his stereo or the piano and sing to Carmen McRae, Shirley Horn or other great jazz artists, while duck was in the oven (or some other scrumptious dish) along with a plate of pate and wine at the ready, all for the evening's feast to be shared with Russell Clinton, his husband and life partner for 23 years, and, on many occasions, close friends. During his stay fighting cancer in various hospitals and healthcare facilities, Bryan often said that the rooms that he was in were ""simply awful"", and ""he wants to go out in style"" - of course his care and room assignments were, in fact, top notch! But, we all know Bryan and his desire to be surrounded by beauty. So, what did he do to dress up his room(s)? He buys a beautifully designed Simon Pearce lamp for only a brief stay. And, at Christmas, even though he was unable to eat solid foods or drink, he had a bounty of epicurean delights delivered from Dean and Deluca for him to taste and smell, including his favorite wines and brandy, all for the decadence of it all, and to celebrate his favorite holiday in abundance with his dear Russell. In addition to his husband Russell, Bryan is survived by his father, Joseph; father and mother-in-law, Bill and Ruthann; brother, David, and his partner, Christine; Russell's sister, Debbie and her children Calvin, Travis and Kiara and numerous other family members and friends. A celebration of Bryan's life will be held at 4pm, Friday, January 29, 2016 at Buckingham Friends School, 5684 York Road, Lahaska, PA. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania Annual Fund, Penn Medicine Development, 3535 Market Street, Suite 750, Philadelphia, PA 19104 or online at https://www.cancer. pennmedicine.org.

A great-grandson of the founder of Daytons, Bob carried on the family retail and community-oriented legacy. After graduating from Yale in 1964, Bob joined what was to become Dayton Hudson and then Target, rising to become General Merchandise Manager and then Vice President of Stores. While with Daytons, Bob attended the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School. A merchandiser at heart, Bob became recognized for his deftness in identifying and supporting designers such as Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren early in their careers. In 1977 Bob left Daytons and purchased Harold, an upscale specialty store for women. Working together with his wife Joanie, Bob restored its iconic status as a Minneapolis retail institution. In 1984 Bob spearheaded the development of The Conservatory, the first enclosed shopping complex in Minneapolis. Throughout his career Bob advocated for a thriving downtown and worked to strengthen the Twin Cities as a major league community through efforts to bring Superbowl XXVI to Minneapolis, keep the Timberwolves, and secure funding for a new outdoor Twins stadium. Bob served on several corporate boards including Northwestern National Bank, First American Funds, and Williams Sonoma. In 1992 Bob became CEO of Okabena, helping transform the Dayton family office into a nationally recognized leader in the then-nascent family office industry. Fiercely loyal to and enormously proud of the people and places he loved, Bob was committed to serving his community. He worked tirelessly on behalf of many non-profits including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Abbott Northwestern Hospital, the United Way, and Westminster Presbyterian Church.

2016-01-24T00:00:00Z,"WEIDENFELD--Lord George. The World Jewish Congress mourns the passing of a giant, a committed philanthropist, world-renowned publisher of authors including Vladimir Nabokov, articulate advocate of the Jewish people and fearless defender of the Jewish State of Israel. George Weidenfeld grew up in Vienna and fled Austria after the Nazi takeover in 1938. Because he was saved by a Christian family, George never forgot that his life was spared by Christians and just last year, he created a foundation to rescue thousands of persecuted Christians in the Middle East. This man never forgot his debts and always repaid them. As an immigrant during World War II, George became an integral part of the BBC World Service and broadcast reports in several languages. In 1969, Queen Elizabeth acknowledged Britain's appreciation and knighted him, followed by a life peerage in the House of Lords in 1976. Last April, at the age of 95, Lord Weidenfeld was awarded the WJC's Theodor Herzl Award in London and became an honorary vice-president of the World Jewish Congress. There are few people in the entire world who have spoken out with more courage against injustice. Our dear friend George was one. He was one of the most inspiring and accomplished figures of the 20th and 21st centuries. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Annabelle, daughter Laura, grandchildren and great grandchildren. We will miss him deeply. World Jewish Congress President Ronald S.

Awarded her Doctorate of Hebrew Literature at age 66, Dr. Zielenziger was instrumental in creating the curriculum for teaching the books of Genesis and Exodus in Conservative Judaism at the Melton Research Center of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. The Melton program emphasized critical inquiry and the study of Bible for character education. She was a proponent of studying the creation myths and texts of other Middle Eastern cultures in order to better understand the context in which the Bible was written. Born in London, the daughter of Leo and Lola Herrmann, ardent Zionists, she grew up in Jerusalem before the founding of the Jewish state, and served as an ambulance driver and chauffeur in the British Army during World War II, where her fluency in Hebrew, English and German was invaluable. After the War, she attended the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where she met a German emigre and fellow student, Yehuda Pfeuffer, whom she renamed Yehuda Amichai. Amichai went on to become Israel's most celebrated poet, and the first drafts of many of his most enduring poems were composed as letters exchanged between the two. Amichai's letters to Dr. Zielenziger are now archived at Ben Gurion University in Israel. She moved to New York in 1947, to study at the Teachers Institute of the Seminary. While in New York she met and subsequently married Eric W. Zielenziger, a German Jewish survivor of the Holocaust who escaped the Nazis by living underground in Amsterdam for more than two years. They had two children. For 34 years, Dr. Zielenziger taught education at the Jewish Theological Seminary, after teaching for many years in Hebrew schools in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. Before relocating to Riverdale in their later years the Zielenzigers lived primarily in Freeport and Great Neck, NY. She is survived by her sons David, of Great Neck, and Michael (Diane Abt) of Oakland, CA and Manhattan and a brother, Dr. Gabriel Herrmann of Jerusalem. 1/3"

After earning a Master of Architecture degree from Yale University, Fredenburgh worked for a quarter century at I.M. Pei & Partners, where he was an associate partner and design principal. He established his own office, Fredenburgh Wegierska-Mutin Architects, in 1990. In his work with the Pei firm and in independent practice, each of his buildings marked its setting with iconic forms and distinctive public spaces, from a master planned waterfront promenade in Dubai to the iconic CenTrust Tower in Miami, Texas Commerce Tower in Houston, and First Interstate World Center, the tallest building west of Chicago, which provides a memorable centerpoint to the vast horizontal landscape of Los Angeles. Harold Fredenburgh also made major contributions to the design of the John Hancock Tower in Boston. Fredenburgh's efforts in landmark preservation and planning policy contributed to shaping New York City. For two decades his leadership in planning and design review in his home community of Bronxville, New York, was instrumental in preserving the unique character of a landmark residential village while allowing it to meet the challenges of contemporary needs. He was a guiding voice on the Scholarship and Brunner Award Committees of the American Institute of Architects/New York Chapter, a member of the Planning and Urban Design Committee, and a founding member of the Society of Architectural Historians. An unusually well read and scholarly architect, he was an accomplished international lecturer on design and urban planning issues, and was widely regarded in both the university and in the office as a dedicated teacher and ardent advocate of young professionals. As a consequence of his experience with the design of tall buildings, in 1998 he was elected one of four American members of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Building Sciences. He was elevated to Fellowship in the American Institute of Architects in 2014. Harold Fredenburgh will be very missed by his daughter Audrey Mateer, son-in-law Robert Williams, Anna Mutin, friends and colleagues. 1/3"
