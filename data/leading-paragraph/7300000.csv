The guides aren't especially comprehensive or surprising (and, honestly, who traipses around Tokyo with a hardcover in his pocket?), but they're nonetheless beautifully produced enough for some dreamy armchair travel. What you actually might want in your pocket as you roam a foreign land is a Fabriano notepad. The Bouquet set includes seven booklets, each with a different type of paper - parchment, vellum, embossed - suitable for, say, tracing a gargoyle at Père Lachaise or jotting down first impressions of the Forbidden City. (Remembering a trip through a travel diary can be just as rewarding as browsing old photographs). To keep all your itineraries in order, there's the new diary set from Moleskine, with a different color soft-cover booklet for each month. It contains plenty of stickers and numbers and ledgers for a total taxonomical orgy, and it all tucks snugly into a black binder that snaps shut with the company's usual elastic band. The Tumi set is $125 at Tumi stores and tumi.com; Fabriano's Bouquet is about $17 at Binders; and the Moleskine set is $40 at barnesandnoble.com."

Roundabout also said that a previously named cast member, Michael Arden (“Big River”), has left the production due to schedule conflicts. Preview performances for “Sondheim on Sondheim” at Roundabout’s Studio 54 theater are scheduled to begin March 19, with an opening night of April 22. ... Laurie Metcalf, right, late of the shuttered Broadway revival of “Brighton Beach Memoirs,” has landed with the New Group’s revival of “A Lie of the Mind” by Sam Shepard, which is being directed by Ethan Hawke.

2009-12-10T00:00:00Z,"Simon & Schuster announced plans on Wednesday to postpone by four months the e-book releases of 35 titles that are to come out in hardcover between January and April. Titles in the delayed schedule include “The High School Reunion Diet” by David Colbert; “Point Omega” by Don DeLillo; “Courage and Consequence” by Karl Rove; and “French Women Don’t Get Fat Cookbook” by Mireille Guiliano. A spokesman for Simon & Schuster, Adam Rothberg, said the company — which previously delayed the e-book release of Stephen King’s “Under the Dome” by several weeks — had noticed that e-book sales were cannibalizing hardcover sales: “We’ve decided that we need to see what happens when we have this e-book sequencing of delaying the e-book for four months and how that affects the hardcover sales and how that affects e-book sales.” Other publishers have also begun to postpone e-book publications. A spokeswoman for Hachette Book Group, which publishes blockbuster authors like James Patterson and Stephenie Meyer, said that starting in January or February the company would delay the e-book release on a wide selection of titles. John Sargent, chief executive of Macmillan, owner of imprints like Farrar, Straus & Giroux and St. Martin’s Press, said the company had already delayed e-book publication on several novels, including those by Janet Evanovich and “The Gathering Storm,” the 12th volume in “The Wheel of Time” series by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. In a statement, Amazon.com, which sells e-books on its Kindle reader, said: “Authors get the most publicity at launch and need to strike while the iron is hot. If readers can’t get their preferred format at that moment, they may buy a different book or just not buy a book at all.”."
2009-12-10T00:00:00Z,"After a scandal, the Oxford Professorship of Poetry, an elective post, will be awarded in a new way. Any Oxford graduate used to be entitled to vote as long as he or she showed up on the appointed day, and over the years this system led to a certain amount of electioneering. Ruth Padel, the first woman to hold the position, had to step down in May after just nine days on the job when it was disclosed that she had been involved in a smear campaign against her main rival, the Nobel Prize-winning poet Derek Walcott. The post has been vacant ever since. On Tuesday, Oxford University said it was rewriting the rules to allow graduates to vote online as well as in person and over a longer period of time. Already some are complaining that in the old system at least a voter had to care enough to travel to Oxford and that the new rules make casting a ballot entirely too easy. According to The Guardian, the university hopes to fill the post by next fall."

Headley, 49, the son of a former Pakistani diplomat and a Pennsylvania socialite, is accused of providing support to Lashkar-e-Taiba, a group based in Pakistan that had been established to fight against Indian control of disputed territory in Kashmir. But experts said that the case against Mr. Headley suggested that the group might have begun to broaden its targets. On Nov. 26, 2008, some 10 Lashkar members armed with grenades and assault rifles arrived in the Mumbai harbor on inflatable boats.

My colleagues Jigar Mehta and Katie Thomas produced this compelling profile, which also discusses new scientific evidence linking longterm steriod use with kidney damage. Mr. Antonecchia, once a strong man, must adapt to new limitations. His easygoing and sympathetic nature seem an odd juxtaposition to the hulking pictures from his past. He explains his motivation in using anabolics, as he calls them, but the viewer is left to wonder about the price he paid.

2009-12-11T15:45:44Z," As young men in 1980s London, Alistair Hook and Ben Joseph played in punk bands, chased girls and drank a lot of beer. They started brewing their own in Hook's small flat in the city's Greenwich neighborhood and, after developing a taste for artisanal brews, they officially introduced Meantime Brewing and opened their first brewery and pub, the Greenwich Union, in 2001. More than a dozen types of beer later - including pilsners, stouts, wheats, flavored brews and a yearly roster of limited-edition releases - Meantime has become the only real beer success story to come out of London in a very long time.  Hook says he started Meantime not only because he loved beer, but also because of what he considered to be London's appalling British beer scene. Artisanal beers produced in Britain are predominantly D.I.Y. one-man shows, brewed in houses or garages or small pubs, and mostly in the bread-basket regions of Kent and Sussex. There is no microbrew movement here; indeed, eight out of 10 beers consumed in the city come from foreign companies, like Anheuser-Busch, Heineken and SABMiller. ""They taste of nothing,"" says Hook, referring to the pasteurization process of mass-produced beer, which wipes out the carefully cultivated flavors that American microbreweries are famous for. Meantime's efforts aren't appreciated by everyone. The company is often castigated by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), a British organization dedicated to preserving Britain's historical brewing standards. By definition, British Real Ale is fermented in the vessel it's consumed from, whereas Meantime's beers are brewed and fermented slowly in giant steel tanks. CAMRA maintains that Meantime Brewing is quintessentially un-British. That may be one reason that the United States is Meantime's largest export market, selling to pubs and shops in 29 states. (You can find a full list on the Web site.) But the company is certainly gaining ground at home. Having since moved their headquarters to the crusty Docklands warehouse district in south London, the men of Meantime will open their second pub and brewing lab in March. The Old Brewery will occupy a site that, 300 years ago, was home to the Royal Naval Hospital's brewery, an operation set up to provide veterans and war pensioners with their daily pint. Records show that Londoners have been brewing beer on the same site since the time of Henry VIII.  Until then, look out for the release this month of Meantime's last seasonal lager for the year, a smocked bock brewed in the Franconian style - meaning the Munich malts used in the recipe are smoked. Hook says the beer tastes like Christmas in a bottle, with notes of ham, smoked cheese and other hearty foods found at the table this time of year. You may have to look hard for it, though. Hook is unconcerned with meeting quotas or filling orders ahead of his competition. ""We're not always on schedule with our beer deliveries,"" he says, ""but then we don't rush the fermentation process. We want the flavors in our beers to reach full potential. After all, what's in a name is what it's all about."""

2009-12-11T00:00:00Z,"Among the many people who aren’t laughing at “Brüno,” Sacha Baron Cohen’s comedy-documentary about a gay fashion reporter, is Ayman Abu Aita. Mr. Abu Aita, an interview subject who is characterized as a terrorist in the movie, says he has been misrepresented and is suing Mr. Baron Cohen for slander, The Associated Press reported. In the film Mr. Baron Cohen (in the guise of Brüno, above) travels to the Middle East and interviews Mr. Abu Aita, who he says is a leader of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades. Mr. Baron Cohen explained how the scene was created during an interview on “Late Show With David Letterman” in July: “We thought, what could people see that they’ve never seen before on film? And we thought one thing would be a comedian interviewing a terrorist.” Mr. Abu Aita has previously said he is not a member of Al Aksa, and is a member of a regional committee of Fatah, the dominant party in the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank. In his lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, Mr. Abu Aita said he is a Christian and a “peace-loving person who abhors violence,” according to The A.P. He also said that the “Brüno” interview was not conducted at a secret location, as Mr. Baron Cohen has said, but at a hotel he chose. Mr. Abu Aita also named NBC Universal, which distributed the film, and its director, Larry Charles, in the lawsuit, as well as CBS, which broadcasts “Late Show,” and Mr. Letterman’s production company, Worldwide Pants."

She was devoted to her family: her husband, Fred, a child prodigy and professional violinist, who predeceased her in 1949; her sons, Robert M. Feldman, who predeceased her in 2000 and Martin S. Mann of Piermont, NY, daughters-in-law Nancy Edman Feldman of Boston, MA and Lorena Mann of Piermont, NY.

A man of many parts, Hoving was a flamboyant performer in public, yet, in private, he preferred a quiet, more contemplative life, reading voraciously on his Kindle. He was an opinionated intellectual who served as a mentor to scores of people, from those he inspired to enter the art world to others in whom he instilled his passion for flying. In addition to being a commercially-rated pilot, Hoving was an alpine skier, an ocean sailing racer, an avid cyclist, a Marine lieutenant, as well as an author, lecturer, and art historian of the first rank. His response to the diagnosis of cancer was, ""I'm 78 and I've lived a great life."" Hoving is survived by his wife, Nancy; his daughter Trea Hoving, and his grandchildren Amelia, Kate, and Matilda Leventhal.

2009-12-12T00:00:00Z,"Did the conductor Christoph von Dohnanyi smile when he first faced the New York Philharmonic before his latest guest appearance with the orchestra this week? He must surely have nodded in recognition of certain parallels. The Philharmonic players have been reseated since Alan Gilbert's arrival as music director. As always, the first violins sit to the left of the podium. But the second violins now sit to the conductor's right, with cellos and violas in between, and double basses arrayed to the rear left. The configuration is one that Mr. Dohnanyi himself adopted as the music director of the Cleveland Orchestra, where he served with distinction from 1984 to 2002, and Mr. Gilbert was an assistant conductor at that orchestra in the mid-1990s. The arrangement, Mr. Gilbert has said, offers increased clarity and balance, qualities that Mr. Dohnanyi's ensemble possessed in abundance."

The spying sentence grew out of a spat touched off by Thailand's fugitive former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, when he appeared in Cambodia last month as a guest of the government. That visit appeared to serve dual purposes for Mr. Thaksin, whose supporters continue to hold rallies calling for his return, and for Mr. Thaksin's host, Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, who has been feuding with Thailand's current government."

It may be like Siegfried braving his way to the side of the sleeping Brünnhilde or like ... well, perhaps like the journey that Carl G. Jung tried to outline in a private chronicle he kept for 16 years that until recently had scarcely been seen by anyone outside the extended family of his descendants. It's an elaborately designed scripture, filled with his fantasies and surreal imaginings, known as ''The Red Book.''"

Two reigning men's world champions and a former women's World Cup overall winner are among those whose Olympic hopes have ended because of major accidents in recent weeks. At least two other medal hopefuls sustained serious injuries in crashes earlier this year, including Daniel Albrecht of Switzerland. Albrecht sustained brain injuries in January and was in an induced coma for three weeks."

A man of many parts, Hoving was a flamboyant performer in public, yet, in private, he preferred a quiet, more contemplative life, reading voraciously on his Kindle. He was an opinionated intellectual who served as a mentor to scores of people, from those he inspired to enter the art world to others in whom he instilled his passion for flying. In addition to being a commercially-rated pilot, Hoving was an alpine skier, an ocean sailing racer, an avid cyclist, a Marine lieutenant, as well as an author, lecturer, and art historian of the first rank.

After all, a 15 percent discount, or no interest payments for 18 months, sounds enticing when you are buying gifts by the armful. But before you start filling out the application, there are some things you need to know. If you carry a balance on store-brand cards, known in the industry as private-label cards, or if you miss a payment on your no-interest purchase, you can end up wiping out those initial savings, and then some. And when you open a new credit card, your credit score can suffer, too."

'' Looking back, you might say his whole tenure was itself a decade-long ''happening.'' This wasn't altogether good, it's true.

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"DRESSING up this holiday season doesn't have to mean donning a fussy L.B.D. As designers like Christopher Kane, Sonia Rykiel, Isabel Marant and Alexander Wang proved, there is an easier, more relaxed way to go, that is no less elegant: Pull on a plush, cozy sweater and pair it with an eye-popping skirt. At the Venice Film Festival earlier this fall, Jane Birkin (above) tested out the look, walking the red carpet in Dries Van Noten's mohair sweater, hung lackadaisically over an ocher-colored pencil skirt (also Dries). Were she wearing a slinky skin-baring gown, she wouldn't have looked more glamorous or feminine. ''It's a nice idea -- burrowing yourself in a big, soft sweater,'' said the stylist Samira Nasr. She recommends borrowing a V-neck cashmere sweater from a husband or boyfriend, and pairing it with something a bit more body-conscious -- a slim skirt or skinny ankle-length trousers -- and a great pair of heels. ''In the end, it's a very classic look,'' she said. ''And so chic.''"
2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"The headline for Ed Zuckerman's profile asks whether it matters that audiences don't always get the joke. I found the answer in the mid-1970s when my company needed to get the attention of its sales force to tell customers about a product improvement. ''Let's make it funny,'' my boss said. ''We'll get Bob and Ray to get the word out to the troops.'' After their morning radio show in New York City, Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding flew to Rochester to listen to marketing executives describe the significance of the product enhancement. A week later they were back, doing a 10-minute sketch that was one of the most hilarious performances I had ever witnessed. Through my joyful tears I saw that no one else had even a smile. As the pair left for the airport, Bob Elliott's eyes twinkled like Christmas lights. Does it matter that audiences don't always get the joke? Evidently not to Bob and Ray, who seemed happier to spoof the suits than to get paid for a completed job."
2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"Attention, anxious parents with sleepless newborns: It's even worse than you think! You already know that a baby with poor sleep habits means misery for you and doesn't seem like much fun for him or her. But this year, evidence emerged that those sleepless nights may also be a sign of bigger troubles to come. According to a new study, erratic sleep patterns in the first 18 months of life correlate at age 2 with reduced ''executive functioning'' -- the term psychologists use to refer to the ability to focus your thoughts, control your impulses and avoid distractions. And executive-function abilities in childhood, recent research has determined, predict future success in school and in life. Annie Bernier, a psychologist at the University of Montreal; Stephanie M. Carlson, a psychologist at the University of Minnesota; and two colleagues followed 60 families with new babies, and at 12 and 18 months asked them to keep a ''sleep diary'' tallying how many hours the babies slept at night and during the day. (They decided not to use total hours slept as their measure of sleep quality, because babies gradually need less sleep as they grow. Instead, the researchers postulated that sleeping more hours at night and fewer during the day, as older children do, was a sign of better, more ''mature'' sleep patterns in infants.)"

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"Keeping your Social Security number (S.S.N.) secure is key to preventing identity theft and fraud. But there have always been bugs in the system. People have known for decades about the conventions that the Social Security Administration uses when issuing S.S.N.'s, and not long ago, scientists figured out how to use this information to determine from a given S.S.N. the birth date of the applicant and the state in which the number was issued. Thankfully, though, the reverse was not true: an unknown S.S.N. could not be determined from that data. Until now. This year, Alessandro Acquisti, an economist, and Ralph Gross, a computer scientist, both at Carnegie Mellon, announced in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they had figured out how to predict a person's S.S.N. Their work was made possible, paradoxically, by steps the government took to prevent identity theft and fraud. Years ago, for instance, the administration decided to make public its Death Master File -- the list of every S.S.N. taken out of circulation, together with the name, birth date and state in which the deceased originally applied for a number. The release of the file was supposed to make it harder for criminals to hijack dead people's S.S.N.'s, since those numbers could be easily cross-checked. But it provided Acquisti and Gross with a data set that they could analyze for patterns in how the numbers are assigned."

That has prompted a back-to-the-future solution: fake car noise that will alert the unwary."

Widely known for his generous mentoring, passion for science, commitment to public service, love of family, and infectious humor. Born in 1918 in the Bronx, he attended City College of NY and earned a Master's from Columbia (1940). Originally ineligible for military service, Garmezy paid for his own surgery in order to join the Army and fought with the 28th Infantry Division in the Battle of the Bulge. After earning a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Iowa, he taught at Duke 1950-1961. In 1961 he was appointed Professor of Psychology at the University of Minnesota, and adjunct faculty, Institute of Child Development, remaining until his 1989 retirement. His ground-breaking study of resilience, exploring how some children at risk for mental disorders thrive, shifted psychology from its previous focus on psychopathology and influenced such diverse fields as brain plasticity, suicide prevention, and disaster planning. Appointed by Carter to the President's Commission on Mental Health. Honors include election to the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences; Gold Medal Award from the American Psychological Association for Lifetime Contributions in the Public Interest; and the highest honors of the Society for Research in Child Development.

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"As we move through fall toward winter, I can sense the local news channels gearing up their daily love-hate relationship with the weather. It was not always so. When I was growing up in the 1950s and '60s, television and radio weather reporters were usually called forecasters, not meteorologists. Their reports were short. Precipitation, temperature, wind speed. Take an umbrella. Dress accordingly.

But it is the inimitable Daphne Guinness (top right) and her collection of antique diamond brooches -- which she regularly wears in her hair, clustered at the collar of a dress, cascading down the front of a gown -- that has inspired us to run to our nearest flea market and buy fistfuls of the sparkling things.

It is fitting that war and occupation have turned Iraq into a cradle of American nationhood, as American empire- and nation-building have been intimately linked since the founding of the republic. But it remains to be seen whether nation-building -- the necessary legitimizing corollary to empire-building in our post-Wilsonian world -- will result in effective sovereignty for Iraq (and Afghanistan) and security for the United States.

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"Laura Parker, an artist and agricultural activist based in Northern California, asked a friend late last year to raise a 320-pound pig on his farm to see if its flavor would match that of the dirt it grew up on. In May, Parker and her friends butchered, slow-cooked and ate the pig while smelling soil from the same farm. At first, they were skeptical that they would recognize similarities between the dirt and the pig, which had been fed strictly local produce, bread and goat whey. But ''it was harmony,'' Parker says. Just to be sure, they tasted the pork while smelling soil from other farms, and it was obvious: in those other cases, there was no match. ''Grassy'' and ''creamy'' are common terms for wine tasting, but now they're being used to describe flavors of soil. Parker has held many similar tastings -- primarily in art galleries, free to the public -- with fresh dirt from local farms. ''Soil is the basis of everything we eat,'' she says. During the tastings, Parker spoons dirt into stemmed wineglasses and adds a small amount of water -- essentially making mud -- to release the soil's aroma."

According to national regulatory agencies, even seconds-long exposure to sound greater than 140 decibels brings risk of permanent hearing loss. Some people, like the demonstrators who heard it used by police officers this year at the G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh, call the LRAD an acoustic weapon. A spokesman for its manufacturer, American Technology Corporation, calls it a ''communication device.'' But all agree: It's loud. The LRAD has been on the market since 2003 and has been used by private companies and foreign governments, but it gained new attention this year when the Pittsburgh Police Department used it in what is believed to be the first public deployment of the siren in the United States. (The department says it did not turn the mechanism up to its highest volume.)

The mountain tops out at about 3,000 feet, making for verticals of only about 625 feet.

But this amounts to little more than a go-ahead for states to put bike-route signs on existing roads."

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"In August, after the suppression of Iran's pro-democracy protests, officials in Tehran accused Western governments of using online social networks like Twitter and Facebook to help execute a ''soft coup.'' The accusation wasn't entirely off-base. In Iran and elsewhere, this year showed the growing importance of social networks to U.S. foreign policy. Long before the protests in Iran started, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees U.S. civilian international broadcasting, had in place software to counter censorship in countries like Iran, so people could better access the blogosphere. And the State Department financially supports agencies that make it easier for Iranians and others to surf the Web. After the protests began, the State Department asked Twitter to reschedule a maintenance outage so the activists could continue to spread the word about their movement."
2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"Many parents who light up are aware of the dangers of secondhand smoke; they blow it out the window or smoke at home only when the kids are not there. But people rarely account for what is left behind after a cigarette has been extinguished. When smoke dissipates, it does not just disappear. Compounds are left over that settle on walls, furniture and clothes, or become part of house dust. Call it ''thirdhand smoke,'' which is what a team of researchers trying to raise awareness of the dangers of smoking named it in January. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, surveyed 1,500 smokers and nonsmokers about the hazards of secondhand and thirdhand smoke and found that 84 percent of smokers believe secondhand smoke is dangerous to children, while only 43 percent think thirdhand smoke is harmful. But the compounds in thirdhand smoke can be ingested or absorbed through the skin, and some give off gases as they deteriorate, says Jonathan Winickoff, an associate professor of pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the research. Many are carcinogenic."

Last season, under the 22-year-old first-year coach Marty Young, Medora lost more games than any of the roughly 400 high school teams in Indiana. But on Friday against Tabernacle Christian at the Medora gym, the junior Tyler Ault scored 26 points, including the winning basket with little more than a minute remaining, to lead the Hornets to a 45-44 victory. A planned postgame pizza party at a nearby church turned into an impromptu bonfire in the parking lot. A fire engine carried the team (1-4) through the streets and was followed by a line of cars.

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"When David Teie, a cellist with the National Symphony Orchestra, wanted to test his ideas about where our emotional response to music originates, he decided to try them out on monkeys. He figured that if his theories were right -- namely, that our response to the ''emotional vocalizations,'' pulses and heartbeats that we first hear in the womb establishes our sense of music -- then he should ''be able to write music for another species that's effective for that species.'' He contacted Charles Snowdon, a psychology professor who ran a colony of cotton-top tamarins in Madison at the University of Wisconsin, who sent him recordings of tamarin calls that demonstrated fear and calm. The fear-based calls ''showed evidence of tritones and minor seconds,'' Snowdon says, and the calming calls had ''long slow notes with some nice harmonic structure.'' Teie wrote four pieces for cello and voice based on the tamarin vocalizations, two ''threat-based'' and two ''affiliative.'' So that the tamarins could hear the compositions on their own terms, he sped them up three octaves. Even at human tempo, the threat-based music sounds martial and alien. Teie also chose four pieces originally designed for human listeners and played them to the tamarins for comparison, including bits of Barber's ''Adagio for Strings'' and Metallica's ''Of Wolf and Man.'' Over two months, seven pairs of adult tamarins heard all eight pieces of music. Monkeys ''really don't care much for human music,'' Snowdon says, and they showed very little response to it, with the weird exception of excerpts from Metallica and ''The Grudge,'' by Tool, both of which soothed the monkeys slightly."

Meanwhile, off the runways, many sturdy American outerwear and workwear brands that were actually around during the Depression were enjoying their own unlikely upscale revival. Call it heritage chic. The progressive clothing boutique Opening Ceremony, which was already using for its own house line fabrics from Pennsylvania's Woolrich, America's oldest continuously operating wool-clothing manufacturer (est. 1830), sought this year to further reimagine classic American clothing. It designed new collections in collaboration with Pendleton, the hundred-year-old Oregon company famed for its woolen shirts, and with the venerable footwear companies Keds (est. 1916) and Timberland (est. 1952)."
2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"''It happens when nobody is watching.'' As the tagline on a poster raising awareness about domestic violence, that's not bad. But it was the poster itself that was truly attention-grabbing -- for it brought the issue of being watched (or not) to life. The poster, placed in a bus shelter in Berlin, was a one-time installation sponsored by Amnesty International. When a person in the shelter was looking at the poster, he saw, along with the words, a photograph of an amiable couple: a stocky, professional-looking man in a blue oxford-cloth shirt, his arm around the shoulders of his girlfriend or wife. If no one in the shelter was paying attention to the poster, though, the image switched: now the man was raising his fist against the woman as she leaned away and protected her face. (There was a slight lag in the switch, so viewers could notice that the poster was changing its image.)"

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"The classic longboard is an elongated, slightly concave ovoid, a shape that has changed little since surfing was invented by the ancient Hawaiians. But the Swedish designer Thomas Meyerhoffer's longboard, introduced in the spring, has a corseted waist and a narrow tail, with a bottom that is more deeply contoured than a typical board. All that curvaceousness is meant to lend the maneuverability of the shortboard, typically ridden by skilled surfers, to the more stable longboard. Curves have always come naturally for Meyerhoffer, who created the biomorphic eMate laptop, Apple's predecessor to the iBook, and the beanbaglike Chumby, the first ''soft'' computer. After leaving Apple in the late '90s, Meyerhoffer embraced surfing. He started with longboards but soon began wanting a more agile ride, so he tried alternatives like the fish, a shortboard with a swallowtail. None could match the momentum he felt cresting a wave with the big plank of a longboard beneath him, however. His designer's curiosity piqued, he began wondering how he could make the longboard do more."

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"There are many theories about sartorial behavior as an economic indicator. In dark times, hemlines go down. Lipstick sales go up. And high heels grow ever higher, an attempt to lift our collective spirits by elevating women a few extra inches off the ground. So it was, perhaps, that during Paris fashion week in October, Alexander McQueen sent down the runway lobster-claw ankle booties that were the highest, and probably the strangest, shoes we have seen since the disco footwear of the 1970s. ''I don't think it makes sense to play safe in these times,'' McQueen said in an interview, adding: ''The world needs fantasy, not reality. We have enough reality today.'' The boots -- 12 inches tall, and so arched that the models who wore them appeared to be walking on pointe, like alien ballerinas -- were part of McQueen's Spring 2010 collection, ''Plato's Atlantis,'' a dystopian aquatic vision. The surrealistic clothing, digitally printed with reptilian patterns, was itself something to behold, but as the models teetered along, it was difficult to focus on anything but the footwear. (Miraculously, there were no spills.)"

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"Every species -- be it earthworm or great white shark -- is entwined in a vast and complicated system of predator and prey called a food web. To determine which species in a food web are most important to the survival of the larger ecosystem, scientists design computer programs to model how the extinction of a given species would affect the other species in the system. This year, two scientists announced that they had found an unexpectedly useful tool for this purpose: the seminal Google search algorithm. Stefano Allesina of the University of Chicago and Mercedes Pascual of the University of Michigan began with a simple hunch. Google's search engine uses an algorithm called PageRank to identify the most important Web sites on a given topic by analyzing links: a Web page is important if other important pages link to it. How different is this, really, Allesina and Pascual wondered, from an ecosystem, in which a species is important if other important species eat it?"

Mrs. Nef was born Evelyn Schwartz in New York City on July 24, 1913. After an early marriage to puppeteer Bil Baird which ended in divorce, she married Vilhjalmur Stefansson, a noted arctic researcher and explorer, in 1941 and from then until his death in 1962, she worked with him as a researcher and librarian of his extensive polar library. She was active in the Polar Studies Program at Dartmouth College and for two years taught the Arctic Seminar. Following Stefansson's death in 1962, Evelyn moved to Washington and in 1964 she married John Ulric Nef, a historian, professor and founder of the University of Chicago's Committee on Social Thought, a multidisciplinary post graduate program. At age 60, Evelyn Nef earned a degree in psychotherapy and started her own practice. She became a board member of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the National Symphony Orchestra, the Washington Opera, the Paget Foundation, the MacDowell Colony, the Lourie Center for Infants and Young Children and the International Longevity Center. She is a longtime member of the Society of Woman Geographers and its National President from 1969 - 71. She is President of the Evelyn Stefansson Nef Foundation and on the Advisory Council of the Gerontology Department of Mount Sinai Medical Hospital in New York. In 1998 the University of Alaska conferred an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree on her and the Corcoran School of Art awarded her the degree of Doctor of Fine Arts Honoris Causa in May 2000. In 2001 she received the Icelandic Order of the Falcon Medal of Honour and in 2002 Dartmouth College bestowed on her an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. Her autobiography was published by Francis Press, Washington, DC, in May 2002 and is entitled Finding My Way, the Autobiography of an Optimist. Mrs. Nef was predeceased by her husband, John Ulric Nef, a brother and two sisters. She is survived by four nieces, two nephews and several grandnieces and -nephews.

But in countries where mosquitoes spread malaria or other diseases, it can be fatal. Though netting and bug sprays offer some help, this year marked the promising advance of higher-tech antimosquito weaponry. Szabolcs Marka, a Columbia University astrophysicist whose main occupation is searching the universe for black holes, received a grant this year from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a kind of futuristic mosquito net. He and two colleagues are working on a project that creates a ''light shield'' through which mosquitoes and other airborne insects will not fly. Marka says the project has had promising results. In a series of tests, mosquitoes were released into a box partitioned into halves by a laser beam. The mosquitoes stayed in one-half of the box, treating the laser wall as if it were solid (though it did not constitute an actual physical barrier). Marka envisions his laser shield covering doors and windows or encircling a bed with a cone of invisible light shining down from the ceiling."

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"Regarding ''Against Camel Case,'' by Caleb Crain in the On Language column (Nov. 29), I would like to point out that the name ''Mylesna gCopaleen'' is not solely ''indulged as a prerogative of the human being, with all his individual strangeness''; it is also the grammatically correct way of writing the name in the Irish language. Translated into English, the name is Myles of the Copaleens. Just as the ''s'' on the end of Copaleens in English is not part of the proper noun but is an essential part of the grammatical correctness of the word, so do, too, the same rules apply to the ''g.'' In the Irish language, grammar rules frequently require that the spelling of names be changed. While I agree with Crain on the fact that the rules of capitalization should not be randomly flouted for cute brand names, in this case, his example may be taken to project English grammar and punctuation rules on a language in which they do not apply in the same ways."

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"The amount of rain that fell during your first year of life has affected your education, your health and even how much money you can put your hands on -- at least if you are a woman who grew up in the countryside in postwar Indonesia. In 2000, for example, rural women between the ages of 26 and 47 who were born in areas with 20 percent higher rainfall than normal the year after they were born were, on average, more than half a centimeter taller than their luckless (and drier) counterparts. These women also went to school for 0.22 grades longer and had more assets. That may not sound like a lot more education, but it means a year more of schooling for every five girls in those rain-enriched areas. And for every five girls in an area with 20 percent less rainfall than usual, a year of school was lost, compared with women who were born into a year of average precipitation. Just as notable, the Indonesian men who were surveyed showed no rainfall effect either way."

What's more, over the last two decades many countries have phased out one of the most effective extinguishers because it uses the ozone-depleting chemical halon. Yusuf Muhammad and Paul Thomas, industrial-design students at London's Royal College of Art, learned this after a school assignment prompted a conversation with members of the Chelsea Fire Station.

Women's sexual problems must be assessed by integrating the emotional, physical and psychosocial perspectives in order for us to be successful in treating them. Most often, as Bergner's article states, recommended treatment protocols are unilateral; the false assumption is that one ''magic bullet'' should alleviate the problem.

Ultrathin electronic devices can be built using a special inkjet printer that squirts fine layers of complex compounds instead of ink. When the compounds dry, they leave behind sheer metallic films, which in the right combination could act as thermometers, light sensors, even computer chips. So why haven't you seen these gadgets yet? In part because they are hard to power: even the smallest lithium-ion watch battery is too bulky. The solution is to print batteries too. This year, a research team at the Fraunhofer Research Institution for Electronic Nano Systems revealed a 0.6-millimeter-thick battery. It consists of a stack of metal pastes that act as anode, cathode and electrolyte, bound on top and bottom by carbon layers that collect electricity and deliver it to the attached device. This product can be built right into the device it's powering, as part of the production process, so there's no need for an additional assembly line. And the battery can be made as large or as small as needed, simply by printing more of it. The list of possible applications is endless -- from bandages that release medication when they sense an increase in body temperature to wallpaper that changes color at the flick of a switch."

A graduate student at Carleton University in Ottawa, he was watching a lot of movies about the undead and realized that zombification could be regarded as a classic paradigm of infectious spread: people get bitten by zombies, after which they turn into zombies themselves and start biting others. So Munz decided to use the tools of epidemiology to answer a sobering public-health question: could humanity survive a zombie outbreak? Working with a professor and two other graduate students, Munz built a mathematical model of a city of one million residents, in which an outbreak occurs when a single zombie arrives in town. He based the speed of zombie infection on the general rules you see in George Romero movies: after getting bitten, people turn into zombies in 24 hours and sometimes don't realize what's happening to them until they change."

But imagine robots that obey injunctions like Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative -- acting rationally and with a sense of moral duty. This July, the roboticist Ronald Arkin of Georgia Tech finished a three-year project with the U.S. Army designing prototype software for autonomous ethical robots.

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"Nothing divides suburban developers and ''smart growth'' advocates as much as the lowly cul-de-sac. The real estate community loves the meandering, dead-end streets; lots on them sell quickly and at a premium, thanks to their low traffic and perceived safety benefits. But critics complain that cul-de-sacs are a poor use of land; they funnel cars onto clogged arterial routes and restrict access to neighborhoods when emergency vehicles need to respond. For decades the developers have been winning this battle. But this fall, Virginia, under the leadership of Gov. Tim Kaine, became the first state to severely limit cul-de-sacs from future developments. New rules require that all new subdivisions attain a certain level of ''connectivity,'' with ample through streets connecting them to other neighborhoods and nearby commercial areas. If subdivisions fail to comply, Virginia won't provide maintenance and snowplow services, a big disincentive in a state where the government provides 83 percent of road services."

He is lovingly remembered by his grandchildren James and Stuart Reid, Cheyne and Richard Reid and Maude, James and Olivia Stranberg. Dick is survived by his sisters Flora Maher and Kathleen Hunter (Gordon). He is predeceased by his parents, Richard Gavin and Marion Stuart Reid; his in-laws, Walter Augustus and Maude Johnson MacDonald, his brothers Stuart and James. Dick and his identical twin James were born on December 11, 1922 in Edmonton, Alberta. Like his brothers, Dick served in the RCAF in WWII and late in the war, he and all but one of his Halifax bomber crew-mates parachuted to safety near Hanover, Germany where they were eventually captured and interned as POWs until liberated. After the war, he returned to Edmonton and began to build the foundations of his wonderful life. First he married Shirley, his childhood sweetheart, and then he enrolled at the University of Alberta and graduated as a chemical engineer. Fresh out of university, Dick began a long and distinguished career with Imperial Oil and Exxon Corporation. Promotions led him from Edmonton to Sarnia in 1956, to Toronto in '63, to New York in '67, back to Toronto in '69, to London, England in '75 and finally to Mendham, New Jersey in '86. Following his retirement in 1988 as President of Exxon International, he and Shirley divided their time between London, Bermuda and Victoria. Later, they returned to Toronto to be closer to their family. They have also maintained a home at John's Island Club in Vero Beach, Florida. Dick led a full life but also believed that it was important to give back to the community. He was a former Chairman of Ryerson University, Chairman of the Mendelssohn Choir and Chairman of the Red Shield Campaign for Salvation Army in Toronto.

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"The Gaia hypothesis, proposed by the British scientist James Lovelock in the 1970s, states that life preserves the conditions for its own survival. Just as plants breathe out oxygen and humans breathe it in, the whole biosphere keeps the chemistry of air, oceans and soil in a balance that allows life to flourish. The entire planet works together as a giant living organism. Peter Ward, a paleontologist at the University of Washington who specializes in mass extinctions, this year expressed a dimmer view of life on earth. He sees not a self-optimizing biosphere but a tangle of organisms that have evolved to starve their competitors and pollute their surroundings, behaving in ways that are ''inherently selfish and ultimately biocidal.'' In his book ''The Medea Hypothesis,'' named after the Greek mother who slaughtered her own children, Ward argues that for billions of years the biosphere has been its own worst enemy. ''Life seems to be actively pursuing its own demise,'' he wrote recently in New Scientist, ''moving earth ever closer to the inevitable day when it returns to its original state: sterile.''"

Ruppy is the first transgenic puppy, which means that he has genes taken from another species. His red fluorescent luminosity comes from the gene of a sea anemone: the gene was introduced into a dog's skin cell; the nucleus was then cloned and transferred to another dog's egg cell, which was then fertilized and eventually became Ruppy. In what is perhaps a stab at genetic humor, his name is also a hybrid, having been formed by combining ''Ruby'' and ''Puppy.''"

With George Palade at Rockefeller, he worked on the isolation and description of ribosomes and of the endoplasmic reticulum. His work with Dr. Palade on pancreatic cells led to a greater understanding of protein synthesis and protein secretion. Dr. Siekevitz's later work was devoted to the study of events occurring at the neural synapse on the level of intracellular structures, and he identified an important structural element at the synapse called the postsynaptic density. He was coauthor of the first textbook on cell biology, Cell Structure and Function, published in 1963.

He isn't stumped very often by the questions he is asked, but it happened last year, with this one: can a beer bottle, when used as a weapon, put a crack in the human skull? To find out, Bolliger set up an experiment, the results of which were published in The Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine in April. Other scientists had already calculated how much energy it takes to crack the human skull -- between 14 and 70 joules, depending on the location -- so all Bolliger needed to do was to take the same measurements on a beer bottle. ''If the bottle is more sturdy than the skull,'' he says, ''then the bottle will win, and the skull will break.'' Simple as that."

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"America has been adding fluoride to its public water supplies for decades, based on overwhelming evidence that even low levels of the substance can significantly reduce tooth decay, with no major side effects. Now research from Japan suggests expanding the list of aqueous additives -- namely, to lithium. Lithium often occurs naturally, in trace amounts, in water supplies, particularly in areas with a high concentration of granite. In The British Journal of Psychiatry earlier this year, the neuropsychiatrist Takeshi Terao and other researchers showed that communities in Japan's Oita Prefecture with higher levels of naturally occurring lithium in their water supplies had fewer suicides than those with lower levels. The amounts range between 0.7 and 59 micrograms per liter. Lithium in prescription doses (say, 600 to 900 milligrams) helps reduce mood swings in patients with bipolar disorder, but Terao and his colleagues speculate that drinking even small amounts over time has a cumulative effect, building up a resistance to the onset of mood swings in the first place."

They use carbon-capture and storage technology similar to the kind that will be deployed at large power plants, but they aim to absorb carbon from dispersed emissions sources, like vehicles and residences, whose mobility or small size makes individual filters impractical or inefficient. This summer, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers estimated that a forest of 100,000 such trees could mop up half the United Kingdom's carbon emissions, making the forest thousands of times more effective than its natural counterparts."

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"Did Agatha Christie, who wrote several dozen mystery novels during her 53-year career, suffer from Alzheimer's-related dementia? Though some of her biographers have suspected as much, actual evidence was advanced in March by a research team led by Ian Lancashire and Graeme Hirst, professors at the University of Toronto, in a paper called ''Vocabulary Changes in Agatha Christie's Mysteries as an Indication of Dementia.'' The professors digitized 14 Christie novels (and included two more available in the Gutenberg online text archive), and then, with the aid of textual-analysis software, analyzed them for ''vocabulary size and richness,'' an increase in repeated phrases (like ''all sorts of'') and an uptick in indefinite words (''anything,'' ''something'') -- linguistic indicators of the cognitive deficits typical of Alzheimer's disease. The results were statistically significant; Christie's lexicon decreased with age, while both the number of vague words she employed and phrases she repeated increased. Her penultimate novel, ''Elephants Can Remember,'' exhibits a ''staggering drop in vocabulary'' -- of 31 percent -- when compared with ''Destination Unknown,'' a novel she wrote 18 years earlier. For Agatha Christie fans, the findings may be proof of a truth they have long recognized: the author's final two books, written in her early 80s, do not hold up against her earlier ones."

The earth's satellite became abruptly more economically valuable this year, when a NASA probe crashed into the lunar surface and discovered copious amounts of frozen water, a crucial precondition for anyone who wants to establish a base there. There would be military benefits to a moon base, but perhaps more important, there would be commercial ones too: the moon now offers tantalizing mining opportunities, including huge quantities of helium 3, which could be used to generate energy on earth. Many countries and for-profit firms are eyeing the moon. China crashed a probe into the moon's surface in March, and Richard Branson plans to take tourists there on Virgin Galactic."

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"In 1995, two Stanford psychologists, Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson, demonstrated that African-American college students did worse on tests of academic ability when they were exposed beforehand to suggestions that they were being judged according to their race. Steele and Aronson hypothesized that this effect, which they labeled stereotype threat, might explain part of the persistent achievement gap between white and black students. In the years since, this idea has spread throughout the social sciences. Experimental studies have detected the negative effect of stereotype threat on a wide variety of groups, including women, old people, student-athletes at Swarthmore College and Ecstasy users. Last year, a week before the Democratic National Convention, David M. Marx, an assistant professor of psychology at San Diego State University, was sitting at a conference with a couple of colleagues when talk turned to the presidential election. What would the rise of Barack Obama, they wondered, do to the stereotype threat experienced by African-Americans? Their idle contemplation quickly turned into a research project, and they quickly designed an experiment to measure what they called the Obama effect. At a series of moments during the 2008 campaign, Marx and his colleagues gave tests of verbal ability to selected black and white students after first priming them to focus on racial stereotypes of academic performance."
2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"REID--Richard Gavin, passed away peacefully on Wednesday, December 9, 2009 in Toronto, Ontario. At his side were his beloved wife of 63 years and best friend, Shirley (MacDonald), and his devoted family, sons James of Toronto and Donald (Julie) of Greenwich, Connecticut, and daughters, Shirley Reid Howell (H.D.), Barbara Reid, both of Toronto, and Cathy Reid Stranberg (James) of Weston, Massachusetts. He is lovingly remembered by his grandchildren James and Stuart Reid, Cheyne and Richard Reid and Maude, James and Olivia Stranberg. Dick is survived by his sisters Flora Maher and Kathleen Hunter (Gordon). He is predeceased by his parents, Richard Gavin and Marion Stuart Reid; his in-laws, Walter Augustus and Maude Johnson MacDonald, his brothers Stuart and James. Dick and his identical twin James were born on December 11, 1922 in Edmonton, Alberta. Like his brothers, Dick served in the RCAF in WWII and late in the war, he and all but one of his Halifax bomber crew-mates parachuted to safety near Hanover, Germany where they were eventually captured and interned as POWs until liberated. After the war, he returned to Edmonton and began to build the foundations of his wonderful life. First he married Shirley, his childhood sweetheart, and then he enrolled at the University of Alberta and graduated as a chemical engineer. Fresh out of university, Dick began a long and distinguished career with Imperial Oil and Exxon Corporation. Promotions led him from Edmonton to Sarnia in 1956, to Toronto in '63, to New York in '67, back to Toronto in '69, to London, England in '75 and finally to Mendham, New Jersey in '86. Following his retirement in 1988 as President of Exxon International, he and Shirley divided their time between London, Bermuda and Victoria. Later, they returned to Toronto to be closer to their family. They have also maintained a home at John's Island Club in Vero Beach, Florida. Dick led a full life but also believed that it was important to give back to the community. He was a former Chairman of Ryerson University, Chairman of the Mendelssohn Choir and Chairman of the Red Shield Campaign for Salvation Army in Toronto. A celebration of his remarkable life will be held in the New Year. Funeral services under the direction of the Humphrey Funeral Home - A.W. Miles Chapel, Toronto 1-800-616-3311.

Then she heard about Kickstarter, a Web site unveiled in April. At Kickstarter, creative types post a description of a project they want to do, how much money they need for it and a deadline. If enough people pledge money that the artists reach (or surpass) their financial goals, then everyone is billed, paying in advance as you would for a magazine subscription. For goals that aren't reached, nobody is charged. In essence, Kickstarter offers a form of market research for artists. For perhaps the first time, an artist can quickly answer a nagging question: Does anyone actually want my art badly enough to pay for it? If the goal is reached, the artist now has a list of subscribers to her vision. And if the goal isn't reached? ''It's painful, but it's better to find out early,'' rather than spend precious time and money on a project nobody wants, says Yancey Strickler, who helped found Kickstarter. More than 1,000 projects have been started on Kickstarter since April, raising money for projects as diverse as a solo sailboat trip around the world ($8,142 raised) and a book by Scott Thomas documenting how he developed the graphic design for Barack Obama's presidential campaign ($84,614 raised)."

This year, a small publishing house in Philadelphia hit on a more effective formula: Take some Jane Austen, add a healthy dollop of gore and start counting the money. The Austen monster mash-up boom began in April, when Quirk Books published ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,'' a version of the 1813 classic fortified with ''all-new scenes of bone-crunching zombie mayhem,'' by a Los Angeles television writer named Seth Grahame-Smith. The book is about 85 percent Jane Austen, with copious added references to cracked skulls and ninja swordplay.

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"The cremation rate has been on a brisk rise in the United States, in part because cremation is cheaper than burial and saves land. But powering a crematorium requires an enormous amount of gas and also sends carbon dioxide and other pollutants skyward. Enter resomation, an alternative to cremation for the eco-conscious cadaver. Resomation is a process that liquefies rather than burns body tissues. It uses about a sixth of the energy of cremation and has a much smaller carbon footprint, according to Sandy Sullivan, the managing director of Resomation, a company in Scotland that has designed a resomation machine. The Mayo Clinic in Minnesota has been using a similar system since 2006 to dispose of donated bodies, but this year the first commercial Resomator is being installed at a funeral home in Florida, one of three states where the process is legal."

2009-12-13T00:00:00Z,"In 1969, the Canadian psychologist Laurence J. Peter posited the ''Peter Principle'': people in a workplace are promoted until they reach their ''level of incompetence.'' This happens, Peter argued, because we wrongly assume that people who are good at their jobs will also be good at jobs that are one rung up on the corporate ladder -- so we promote them. But often the new job is so different from the previous job that the employee can't handle it. Now performing incompetently, the employee stays in place, dragging the efficiency of the firm downward. Eventually the entire economy becomes like the paper company Dunder Mifflin in ''The Office'' -- clogged with incompetence. Is there any way to avoid this trap? Yes, by promoting people at random."

But it is the inimitable Daphne Guinness (top right) and her collection of antique diamond brooches -- which she regularly wears in her hair, clustered at the collar of a dress, cascading down the front of a gown -- that has inspired us to run to our nearest flea market and buy fistfuls of the sparkling things.

As designers like Christopher Kane, Sonia Rykiel, Isabel Marant and Alexander Wang proved, there is an easier, more relaxed way to go, that is no less elegant: Pull on a plush, cozy sweater and pair it with an eye-popping skirt. At the Venice Film Festival earlier this fall, Jane Birkin (above) tested out the look, walking the red carpet in Dries Van Noten's mohair sweater, hung lackadaisically over an ocher-colored pencil skirt (also Dries). Were she wearing a slinky skin-baring gown, she wouldn't have looked more glamorous or feminine. ''It's a nice idea -- burrowing yourself in a big, soft sweater,'' said the stylist Samira Nasr. She recommends borrowing a V-neck cashmere sweater from a husband or boyfriend, and pairing it with something a bit more body-conscious -- a slim skirt or skinny ankle-length trousers -- and a great pair of heels.

The final product was a neo-renaissance exhibit presented by James Fuentes gallery at the official Art Basel convention center (minus the skate ramp of course).Growing up in the hedonistic boys' club of influential downtown artists - Ryan McGinley, Dan Colen, Dash Snow (to whom she was married for nine years) and Aaron Bondaroff - Snow is an island unto herself. Her roots are literally that: she was born on Corsica, the Mediterranean island surrounded by blue waters but formed by volcanic explosions. She creates a world that is messy, isolated and full of decay, with beauty revealing itself in the least likely places. (Such as at this Christmas dinner party for the Times in 2007.)

2009-12-14T14:36:35Z,"Culti, the Milan-based brand of luxury goods founded by Alessandro Agrati, has brought its version of creamy Italian opulence stateside with a new boutique in Chicago. Two decades ago, Agrati established himself with the glass home-fragrance diffuser with bamboo reeds that became ubiquitous in boutique hotels and restaurant bathrooms. Since then, he has built a mini-empire, with shops in Milan and St. Moritz, day spas and cafes in Italian cities from Naples to Lake Garda, and a small hotel in Puglia. So the no-nonsense Midwestern capital might not seem the obvious choice for a company selling a particular fantasy of la dolce vita - casual dinner parties on yarn-dyed linen place mats, separate sets of silver for home and yacht, leather-lined closets stocked with cashmere jumpsuits. But Agrati is counting on the fact that the Windy City's long winters and large apartments make a market ripe for nesting. And anyway, what's not to like about hand-blown glass candleholders, linen kimonos and cashmere throws, all of it made in Italy? Later this month, Agrati will unveil Culti shops in Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok, and eventually, he says, he hopes to open in New York and Los Angeles."

But Paul Bishop's fledgling company, The New English, intends to reverse that decline by producing dinnerware with a radically different look - think skeletons, bugs and tattoos instead of flowers, garlands or pastoral scenes. Bishop believes he is opening up the market to a new customer for whom traditional products have little relevance or appeal. Bishop, the former chief executive of Winning Moves, a technology company, started The New English in 2008 with his wife, Judith. For him, British design didn't end in the 19th century. He says that the DNA of English style today is just as much about the Sex Pistols and Damien Hirst as it is about Wuthering Heights and J.M.W. Turner."

In a dream sequence, Bart Simpson, who is yearning for a younger brother of his own, encounters everyone from Wilbur and Orville Wright to Peyton, Eli and Cooper Manning.

(You probably have more Facebook friends.) But that's nothing compared with the small number of Academy members needed to secure an Oscar nomination. The Academy, which has a little fewer than 6,000 members, is divided into branches, from acting to public relations to sound; each votes for the award in its own division (everyone gets to vote for best picture). As Steve Pond reports in The Wrap, only 19 votes can secure a nomination for best costume design, 40 for original score and 34 for cinematography; even a best actor nomination can be had with 201 votes.

2009-12-14T00:00:00Z,"A series of popular Coors commercials that ran for several years, until about 2006, opened with a shot of the Rocky Mountains and the text, ''Somewhere near Golden, Colorado.'' The ads featured Pete Coors -- grandson of the brewery founder Adolph Coors and currently chairman of Molson Coors Brewing Company -- standing in the snowy Rockies and commenting that what makes Coors unique is that it is made from that snow, after it melts and flows in streams toward its brewery. A new commercial, by Cultivator Advertising and Design in Denver, for Breckenridge Brewery, a brewpub and bottler also in the Rockies, will look familiar to Coloradans, since it opens with snowcapped mountains and the text, ''Somewhere near Breckenridge, Colorado.'' But after this spokesman -- the head brewer Bob Harrington, pitching the brewery's Lucky U India pale ale -- says the beer is brewed with ''real Colorado water,'' he points to a nearby stream and adds, ''Well, not this water -- do you know what bears do in here?''"

But one feature they don't offer is the ability to engage in conversations with a select group, either based on a location or a specific event. Some Twitter users have tried to remedy this problem by using hash tags. Under the hash tag system, people add a hash or pound symbol (#) before a keyword that is used as an index term for messages on that topic. For example, if I were at a Britney Spears concert (not that I ever have been), I could create a group discussion by appending #britneyspears to my messages. Others at the event could search Twitter for this hash tag and find all concertgoers' messages tagged with it."

Other studies, cited by Michael Cannon and John Goodman, suggest that the number is considerably closer to zero - or else that the link between health insurance and mortality might be too murky too penetrate. But of course there are still other studies that tend to confirm Ezra's numbers ..."

2009-12-15T19:36:18Z,"One of the questions that Sheryl and I get most often when we give lectures about our new book, Half the Sky, is a variant of: Is religion the real problem? My own take is that religion has often been part of the problem, but that it also can be part of the solution. I've seen people kill in the name of religion, and I've seen people reject condoms in the name of religion even as a tool for fighting AIDS (which usually means people dying). But I've also seen Catholic nuns showing unbelievable courage and compassion in corners of the world where no other aid workers are around, and mission clinics and church-financed schools too numerous to mention. And in Islamic countries, I've seen mullahs who are hypocritical misogynists but also some imams who are leading a push for education and justice. In short, I don't think there's any glib answer to the question, but there is no question that religions can be a force for justice and equality that they are now not. This magnificent new speech by Jimmy Carter on this topic makes that point very well. Excerpts:"

A unanimous vote, in which more than 200 members of the local 32 BJ of the Service Employees International Union participated, gave the union bargaining committee the authority to settle or strike. The workers are involved in negotiations with the Broadway League, which represents theater owners, and are demanding a pay raise of $1.50 an hour, a promise not to see their health insurance cut and additional pension benefits. The union's contract expires on Dec. 31, though a spokesman said the last scheduled bargaining date with the Broadway League was this Thursday. The actor Jimmy Smits, who is currently starring in ""God of Carnage"" at the Bernard B.

2009-12-15T00:00:00Z,"Steven Rattner, the former private equity executive and adviser to the Obama administration, will not be stepping away from his keyboard any time soon. On Monday Houghton Mifflin Harcourt said that it had acquired a new book by Mr. Rattner, who until July headed the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, about the government’s efforts to bail out the Chrysler Corporation and General Motors. In a news release, the publisher said that the book, titled “Overhaul” and planned for publication next fall, “will tell the story of the intense 150-day struggle to save the American auto industry, as both Chrysler and GM struggled to stay afloat.” Mr. Rattner, who left the media-focused leveraged buyout firm the Quadrangle Group to join the task force in February, has worked as a financial reporter for The New York Times and as a mergers and acquisitions specialist at Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Lazard. Financial disclosures released by the government revealed that Mr. Rattner was an investor in Cerberus Capital Management, which owned the majority of Chrysler and GMAC. Quadrangle was tied to an inquiry involving the New York State pension fund, but Mr. Rattner was not charged with wrongdoing."
2009-12-15T00:00:00Z,"When the advocacy group United States Artists was created in 2005, the founders decided that the best way to support art was to support artists — by annually giving 50 artists or collaborators $50,000 grants, no strings attached. This year’s winners, who were to be formally announced on Monday night at the Broad Stage in Santa Monica, Calif., include the poet and novelist Sapphire, whose book was recently made into the film “Precious”; the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Nilo Cruz; the sisters behind the fashion label Rodarte, Kate and Laura Mulleavy; the hula master Hokulani Holt-Padilla; the performer Anna Deavere Smith; and the choreographer Sophiline Cheam Shapiro. The nonprofit group, which issued its first awards in 2006, was started with $22 million in seed money from four big foundations. Since then, other organizations and individuals such as Eli and Edythe Broad, Target, and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation have underwritten some of the fellowships. “Other awards are usually tied to a particular kind of project,” Mr. Cruz said from Santa Monica. “With this I can do whatever I want.” One project he said he had in mind at the moment is to adapt one of his plays into a novel."

The Chicago Symphony Orchestra said on Monday that it had appointed Yo-Yo Ma, above right, to the new position of creative consultant. Mr. Ma will work with the conductor Riccardo Muti, above left, who takes over as music director next season. In a similar vein, the New York Philharmonic added the singer Thomas Hampson as artist in residence, joining its new music director, Alan Gilbert, this season, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic appointed the composer John Adams as its creative chair, in tandem with Gustavo Dudamel, its new music director. In the case of Mr. Ma, the emphasis will be more on using the orchestra to serve as an engine for social good. He will have a role, undefined so far, in a concert series for 3-to-5-year-olds; workshops for high school and college students; and programming for incarcerated and at-risk youth. He will also give advice for the orchestra’s outreach programs for young people. “We love doing concerts,” Mr. Ma said, “but there is something more important than doing concerts.”."
2009-12-15T00:00:00Z,"Three Hollywood legends — actually four, if you count the publicist involved, the venerable Pat Kingsley — are working to bring Philip Roth’s most recent novel to the multiplex. Al Pacino, right, has purchased the movie rights to “The Humbling,” about an aging, declining stage actor who finds hope of renewal through a younger woman. Mr. Pacino, who has never optioned a book before, will play the lead, according to Ms. Kingsley. The director will be Barry Levinson, who won an Oscar for “Rain Man” and was nominated for “Bugsy.” (More recently, he has been producing television, including the HBO prison series, “Oz.”) Buck Henry, who just turned 79, is writing the screenplay, Ms. Kingsley said. Mr. Henry is best known for writing “The Graduate,” and his other credits range from the original “Get Smart” television series to “To Die For,” starring Nicole Kidman. “The book is perfect for him” — Mr. Pacino — “because he has a love of the stage, and although he has never personally experienced these feelings, he understands them,” Ms. Kingsley said. Although “The Humbling” received mixed critical notices, Mr. Roth, of course, has won pretty much every writing honor available other than the Nobel Prize, including the National Book Award (twice) and a Pulitzer Prize."

Chris generously supported Penn and The School of Arts and Sciences by endowing numerous Browne Distinguished Professorships to embody his firm belief that academic distinction should be defined by exceptional research, superior teaching, and a dedication to making Penn a leading forum for open dialogue. While Chris' lifelong career was as a leader at the private investment firm of Tweedy, Browne Company, he also was a true renaissance man with a keen wit and a probing intellect.

2009-12-16T00:00:00Z,"The Authors Guild, a trade group that represents writers, posted a statement on its Web site (authorsguild.org) on Tuesday disputing efforts by Random House to claim e-book rights to titles published before 1994. On Friday, Random House sent a letter to dozens of literary agents saying that “the vast majority of our backlist contracts grant us the exclusive right to publish books in electronic formats.” But in its Web site statement, the guild, which has more than 8,000 members, noted that Random House changed its contracts with authors in 1994 explicitly to include electronic book rights. “Random House felt the need to change its contract, quite plainly, because its authors did not grant those rights to it under Random House’s standard contracts prior to 1994,” the guild wrote. The statement continued: “Publishers acquire only the rights that they bargain for; authors retain rights they have not expressly granted to publishers. E-book rights, under older book contracts, were retained by the authors.” Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House, said in a statement that the company “respectfully disagrees” with the Authors Guild and that it believed rights for its backlist were “ours to maximize.”."

Mr. Richards, one of Broadway’s busiest producers, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday afternoon that he was “certainly” interested in the possible transfer of “Orphans,” a three-part, nine-hour play based on the lives of Foote’s parents and relatives in Texas in the early 1900s. “I think it’s a great piece of theater,” he said. Of a possible transfer, he added, “Other people are looking at it too.” The three people involved in the production, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the transfer discussion was meant to be private, said the talks involving Mr. Richards and Ms. Roth — who produced “Irena’s Vow” on Broadway last season and many other plays — accelerated after the exuberant reviews for Part 1 of the cycle last month. The talks have reached a serious stage, but no commitments had been made, these people said. The idea is to transfer and open the production in time to be eligible for the Tony Awards this June."

Environmental groups have long advocated such a compensation program because forests are efficient absorbers of carbon dioxide, the primary heat-trapping gas linked to global warming. Rain forest destruction, which releases the carbon dioxide stored in trees, is estimated to account for 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions globally."

It said the new service, ''Fancast Xfinity TV,'' was a major step toward what it calls ''anytime, anywhere media.'' With a growing number of people bypassing their cable subscriptions and watching movies and television online, Comcast and other operators have scrambled to set up streaming video sites. Their goal is to ensure that people stay connected to cable programming, even if they watch the programs on their computers. The cable industry initiative is often called ''TV Everywhere.''"

2009-12-16T00:00:00Z,"Why a Toronto man stole 2,865 bicycles last year remained a mystery on Tuesday after he pleaded guilty to reduced charges. Under the terms of a plea bargain, the man, Igor Kenk was convicted of possessing just 10 stolen bicycles, as well as cocaine and marijuana. After the 17 months he spent in jail awaiting trial, he will have to serve an additional four months. Similar charges against his common-law wife, Jeanie Chung, a concert pianist, were dropped. The police said Mr. Kenk, who owns a used bike shop, either stole the bicycles or arranged for their theft, and stashed them in garages around the city. While various theories have been floated about his plans for the bikes, he declined an invitation by the judge to make a statement."

The bureau suggests that the projected peak in China, 1.4 billion people, will be lower than previously estimated and that it will occur sooner. With the fertility rate declining to fewer than 1.6 births per woman in this decade from 2.2 in 1990, China's overall population growth rate has slowed to 0.5 percent annually."
2009-12-16T00:00:00Z,"Cabin fever is typically associated with winter shut-ins, but it's the most efficient way to describe the sensations governing Julia May Jonas's play ''For Artists Only,'' part of the Ontological-Hysteric Theater's Incubator program for emerging artists. This 90-minute Nellie Tinder production runs the gamut from intimacy to claustrophobia, and it doesn't tarry often along the way. Jennie (Nina Kassa) has come to stay with Julia (Laine Rettmer) for the summer at her family's home in rural New England. The large house is empty save for a caretaker, Sarah (Meghan Ritchie), who has a complicated romantic history with Julia's mother, and the young women soon begin filling it with their self-involved, often histrionic daily dramas."
2009-12-16T00:00:00Z,"While creating ''Diagnosis of a Faun,'' being performed at La MaMa E.T.C., Tamar Rogoff worked intensively with Gregg Mozgala, a 31-year-old actor with cerebral palsy. In developing the piece Ms. Rogoff and Mr. Mozgala changed his physical capacities: for the first time in his life Mr. Mozgala walks with his heels down and his back straight, conscious of muscles and tendons in his legs that he could never use before. It's an inspiring story, and they deserve both praise and admiration for their collective grit and courage. But good works don't necessarily translate into good art. Sad to say, ''Diagnosis of a Faun'' is an uneasy blend of bad theater and uninspired dance that relies on Mr. Mozgala's sexually charged, languorously animalistic presence, but finds nothing other than strained allegory to support his role."

Mr. Rana, 48, has been charged with providing material support to terrorism for his alleged role in a plot to attack a Danish newspaper that published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.

That was the last major professional title in Philadelphia until Charlie Manuel's Phillies won the 2008 World Series.

(13) TOSCA ''Great Performances at the Met'' begins its fourth season with Luc Bondy's controversial staging of this Puccini opera, starring Karita Mattila, left, in her debut as the prima donna of the title; Marcelo Álvarez as her hot-headed lover, the painter Cavaradossi; and George Gagnidze as Baron Scarpia, the twisted chief of police. Paul Plishka rounds out the cast as Sacristan; Joseph Colaneri conducts. When the opera had its premiere on Sept. 21, Anthony Tommasini, in The New York Times, noted that Mr. Bondy and the production team were jeered when they came out at curtain calls, while Ms. Mattila and Mr. Álvarez received enormous ovations. ''Still, the booing, if a little unfair, was understandable,'' he wrote of the production, which replaces Franco Zeffirelli's from 1985. ''Mr. Bondy's high-concept staging featured stark, spare, cold sets and dispensed entirely with many of the familiar theatrical touches that audiences count on: Tosca placed no candles by the body of the villain Scarpia after murdering him, and did not exactly leap to her death at the end. Mr. Bondy had scoured the work, it seemed, looking for every pretense to flesh out, literally, the eroticism of the lovers and the lecherous kinkiness of Scarpia.'' 10 A.M.

The production of the Tennessee Williams classic, starring Ms. Blanchett as the emotionally damaged Blanche DuBois, has become one of the hottest tickets of the winter, selling out performances and drawing theatergoers to the sidewalks outside the academy, where they have offered hefty sums in exchange for an audience member's ticket."
2009-12-16T00:00:00Z,"Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's postponement of a decision on relocating an American military base on Okinawa may be the product of domestic political considerations as much as deeply held foreign policy principles, analysts here said on Tuesday. But it promises to put new pressures on Japan's already strained ties with the United States, its closest ally. The Obama administration had pressed Mr. Hatoyama's government to make a quick decision on whether to carry out a 2006 agreement between Washington and Tokyo to relocate the base, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, to a less populated part of Okinawa. On Tuesday, however, he announced that he would put off that decision until sometime next year, saying that members of his governing coalition would set up a working group to discuss the current plan and other possible sites for the base."

2009-12-16T00:00:00Z,"Like bowling and golf, the sport of curling features a social element that makes it irresistible to those who play. Curlers shake hands before and after matches, congratulate one another after good shots and often retire to the curling club bar for cocktails to review the night's events. The one thing curling lacks is a caste system. At certain clubs and events, novice curlers compete alongside elites -- even Olympians -- without forking over thousands of dollars for the privilege."

2009-12-16T00:00:00Z,"Since 1995 the George London Foundation for Singers has presented an unusual series of voice recitals at the Morgan Library & Museum that pair an emerging singer with an established artist. The contrast was particularly striking for the latest recital in this series on Sunday afternoon. Marjorie Owens, a 28-year-old American soprano with a big, gleaming voice that suggests that she is a Wagnerian in the making, shared a program with the towering bass-baritone James Morris, an acclaimed Wagner singer. Mr. Morris, who long owned the role of Wagner's Wotan at the Metropolitan Opera, sang it for probably the final time at the Met when the company retired Otto Schenk's production of the ''Ring'' last spring."

Mr. Richards, one of Broadway's busiest producers, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday afternoon that he was ''certainly'' interested in the possible transfer of ''Orphans,'' a three-part, nine-hour play based on the lives of Foote's parents and relatives in Texas in the early 1900s. ''I think it's a great piece of theater,'' he said. Of a possible transfer, he added, ''Other people are looking at it too.'' The three people involved in the production, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the transfer discussion was meant to be private, said the talks involving Mr. Richards and Ms. Roth -- who produced ''Irena's Vow'' on Broadway last season and many other plays -- accelerated after the exuberant reviews for Part 1 of the cycle last month. The talks have reached a serious stage, but no commitments had been made, these people said. The idea is to transfer and open the production in time to be eligible for the Tony Awards this June."

At the heart of the case is the question of whether the government can block a trial by arguing that certain evidence is a ''state secret'' and cannot be revealed to a court. Although the judges on the appeals court did not indicate how they would rule, the fact that they took the case at all indicates the importance of the issue to the court system."

But the selector of the German Olympic team faces a different predicament: he actually wants to leave out some of his most talented players. ''It's a bit of a tightrope act,'' said Uwe Krupp, Germany's coach and the man who will choose the squad. ''We can't simply take all our N.H.L. players just because they're N.H.L. players.

In the past, the only thing missing was attitude, but that's no longer a problem.

On Friday, Random House sent a letter to dozens of literary agents saying that ''the vast majority of our backlist contracts grant us the exclusive right to publish books in electronic formats.'' But in its Web site statement, the guild, which has more than 8,000 members, noted that Random House changed its contracts with authors in 1994 explicitly to include electronic book rights. ''Random House felt the need to change its contract, quite plainly, because its authors did not grant those rights to it under Random House's standard contracts prior to 1994,'' the guild wrote. The statement continued: ''Publishers acquire only the rights that they bargain for; authors retain rights they have not expressly granted to publishers. E-book rights, under older book contracts, were retained by the authors.'' Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House, said in a statement that the company ''respectfully disagrees'' with the Authors Guild and that it believed rights for its backlist were ''ours to maximize.''"

Mr. Reid wrote, “To me it is a sweet, tongue-in-cheek funny and striking image of quirky black hair power.” He added, “I certainly regret offending anyone and while I still love that image, I intend to think long and hard about whatever image is chosen for next year’s cover.”."

Most of them have glovelike pouches for each toe, so wearers can spread their toes for balance and connection to the ground.

However, unlike the Fiesta, this bowl has a decided favorite. Before handing the cherished New Mexico Bowl title to Fresno State, however, take note: the Bulldogs entered this same bowl game last season as sizable favorites, but fell to a hungry Colorado State team (also from the Mountain West, like Wyoming) that preached the same ball-control, turnover-free offense the Cowboys have used to reach six wins."

2009-12-19T00:00:00Z,"FINK--Nina Jones. The Westchester Community College family extends condolences to the family of our matriarch, Nina Jones Fink. Nina had been part of the fabric of Westchester Community College since 1973, when Governor Nelson Rockefeller appointed her to the Board of Trustees. When Hugh Carey became governor, political affiliations changed and Nina had to leave that board. She was immediately asked to join the board of the newly-formed Westchester Community College Foundation, and was an active member of that board to the date of her passing on December 16, 2009. In 1984, Westchester Community College President Joseph Hankin asked her to lead the male-dominated Foundation Board and Nina agreed, on one condition: that she could be both president and chairman. She did not want anyone else telling her what to do. Nina set about to build a Board of Directors whose membership was based on excellence and women were equally represented. Speaking of Nina, President Hankin remarked, ""She has always been ahead of her time. She was a feminist in her own inimitable, quiet way, long before it was fashionable."" Her quiet leadership and forward thinking dedication to public education has left a legacy of accomplishment unequalled in the history of the college. She set a high standard for future volunteer leaders of the college and her gracious presence on campus will be missed. The college will hold a memorial service on Wednesday, December 23 at 11am in the Library and Learning Resource Center on the Valhalla campus. In lieu of flowers, the family wishes any contribution to be sent to the Westchester Community College Foundation."

2009-12-19T00:00:00Z,"There was a time when the alto saxophonist Lee Konitz wasn't a regular attraction on the New York club circuit. Actually, that was the case for much of his career: Mr. Konitz, never the warmest or most ingratiating of jazz legends, has long had a fickle relationship with the spotlight. That probably says more about the spotlight than it does about his art, which has been consistent over the years, obstinately so. Now 82, he has settled into a late-career renaissance by renewing the same lines of inquiry he's had all along. Of course it helps that he keeps changing the context, or letting it change around him. Last week Mr. Konitz was at Birdland with an all-star quartet whose youngest member, at 39, was the pianist Brad Mehldau. This week he's working at Iridium with another intergenerational group, jointly headlined by the eminently gifted tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, who is 44. Without really trying, the engagement serves both as a tribute to Mr. Konitz's early style and a confirmation of his endless renewal."

O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, summing her up as ''a bottomless repository of guilt, destructiveness and general bad feeling.'' Soon, simmering tensions boil over. Bill Irwin plays the father whose attention Kym always seems to deflect from Rachel; Debra Winger is the mother who has never quite come to terms with Kym's past.

The program includes a quotation from the German poet Novalis: ''We are more closely connected to the invisible than to the visible.'' In Mr. Yamazaki's production, that idea is a guiding force. The set design, credited to Ms. Pitois, features strips of orange tape arranged on the floor like rays of light. (It's a little underwhelming.) Ms. Pitois, according to her program note explaining the work's concept, seems to be more intrigued by the abstract connection between the performers and the audience and how perspective is ''experienced in ways both infinite and discrete.''"

The children will live with Ms. Gosselin in their Pennsylvania home, her lawyer said in a statement, and Mr. Gosselin will have visitation rights. ''Jon & Kate'' and a potential spinoff, ''Kate Plus Eight,'' were scrapped last fall after Mr. Gosselin called for production to be halted in the midst of the separation proceedings. Dueling lawsuits by TLC and Mr. Gosselin are pending. But TLC continues to develop a separate project with Ms. Gosselin, and a spokeswoman said on Friday that it was expected to have its debut next spring. BRIAN STELTER"

He called it ''an unprecedented breakthrough'' but acknowledged that it still fell short of what was required to combat global warming. The agreement addresses many of the issues that leaders came here to settle. But it has left many of the participants in the climate talks unhappy, from the Europeans, who now have the only binding carbon control regime in the world, to the delegates from the poorest nations, who objected to being left out of the critical negotiations."

The price, an auction record for this artist, was nearly three times what Mr. Wynn paid for a Rembrandt self-portrait in 2003 at Sotheby's in London. When he bought that painting, for $11.3 million, Mr. Wynn set his alarm for 2 a.m., sneaked into the bathroom so he wouldn't wake his wife and bid on his own behalf by telephone. At the time he said he bought the work because he wanted ''people to see Rembrandt in relation to the Impressionists, post-Impressionists and early Modernists'' already in his collection."

All of the trustees have agreed to give the institution a minimum of $75,000 annually with additional contributions their first year. The institution needs all the help it can get. Last year, having spent its reserves on operating expenses, it was on the brink of financial collapse before the Los Angeles financier Eli Broad pledged $30 million to the museum. Since then it has been slowly climbing its way back to solvency. And when it comes to the art world's elite, they seem to be loyal to each other's causes. Last week, for example, Mr. Pinchuk announced the formation of a new $100,000 international prize for artists under the age of 35, with Mr. Broad a board member."

There is now talk in Tokyo that voters may be showing signs of cooling toward Mr. Hatoyama's government, which swept into power three months ago with pledges for fundamental change in Japan's postwar order.

Since it opened two years ago, FB Lounge has been a fashionable stronghold of Latin jazz every Thursday through Saturday. Non-Latin jazz, to coin an awkward phrase, is a new development there, as of this month. The club has entrusted Mark Payne, a former manager at the Jazz Standard, with booking Sunday through Wednesday nights.

He fouled one pitch, took two balls, fouled two more and lashed a single to center off Brad Lidge. Then Damon stole two bases on one pitch and scored the go-ahead run in the most pivotal sequence of the World Series. The Yankees' 27th championship will be Damon's legacy, and a powerful one."

2009-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Villagers here avoid walking in the rain because they say it burns their skin and causes their hair to fall out. They have trouble breathing at night when, they say, factories release toxic fumes. And they are terrified by what studies show are unusually high cancer rates. Map Ta Phut is the heart of Thailand's industrial underbelly, an area rarely seen by the millions of tourists who visit the country every year. Jutting out into the Gulf of Thailand, the industrial zone is on the scale of a midsize city -- only instead of office buildings and apartments, there are block after block of tangled tubes of steel, vats of chemicals and towering, fire-breathing gas flares."

2009-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The New York Philharmonic must be gratified that a sizable and enthusiastic audience showed up at Symphony Space on Thursday night for the inaugural concert of Contact!, a contemporary-music series. This venture is the brainchild of Alan Gilbert, the orchestra's new music director. Some risk was involved, and not just the obvious worry of whether people would come to a series of contemporary-music concerts. That fear, at least, has been put to rest by the response to this program, which presented premieres of four works for chamber orchestra, conducted by Magnus Lindberg, the Philharmonic's composer in residence. Listeners of all ages, including lots of eager-looking young people, filled the hall. Audience members chatted animatedly during intermission, swapping reactions to the first two pieces."

But after a lengthy discussion, a video review and the use of a stopwatch, officials ruled that Hayward's layup actually ended the game. Their reasoning was that the clock had inadvertently stopped with 14.7 seconds left when the ball had been knocked into the backcourt. Butler retained possession and eventually scored on Hayward's layup."

Seeing Troy in postseason play is really no surprise; the Trojans are the class of the conference, having at least shared the Sun Belt crown in each of the last four seasons. On the other hand, the Blue Raiders are making only their second major bowl appearance -- the first being, you guessed it, a loss to Central Michigan in 2006. If Middle Tennessee has been a surprise this year, Southern Mississippi has lived up to preseason expectations, finishing above .500 for the 16th straight season.

The six-member commission, shared evenly by the two parties, needs a majority for any enforcement action. For months, Republican members have cynically withheld their votes, rejecting staff investigators' sound recommendations for citations and fines in current cases of obvious abuse. They seem to have completely forgotten why they are there: they are supposed to be enforcing the law, not sabotaging it."

But this year a trip to the city's most rarefied retail corridor might make even your credit-card company nervous. Not to worry. Look for luxury that is subtler than an outrageous price tag, and keep the following mantra in mind: When in doubt, just browse. 1 P.M. Arrive by private jet, car and driver, or, more likely, the 4, 5 or 6 train and enter the third-floor atelier of Shahin Samouhi, 766 Madison Avenue, (212) 737-7225. Ms. Samouhi learned tailoring from her mother in her native Iran and fitted customers of the French couturier Emanuel Ungaro before starting her own business 18 years ago. Beneath black crystal chandeliers and surrounded by bolts of exquisite fabric, she can whip a tired 10-year-old dress into this season's shape, or painstakingly copy a designer look for less than the cost of an original (though costly still -- prices vary).

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"106: The number of death sentences projected to be handed down by judges and juries in 2009, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. That number is the lowest since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976. Death sentences reached a high of 328 in 1994. Over the last decade, the number has fallen by 63 percent. The drop was most striking in Texas, which averaged 34 death sentences a year in the 1990s and had 9 this year. Vic Wisner, a former assistant district attorney in Houston, said a ''constant media drumbeat'' about suspect convictions and exonerations ''has really changed the attitude of jurors.'' Still, executions continued apace. Fifty-two inmates were executed this year, compared with 37 in 2008. More than 3,200 inmates remain on death row."

Born January 14, 1928 in Long Island, New York, He was the son of William John Georgas and Helen Laricos Georgas; brother to James Georgas and George Georgas. John was a graduate of Syracuse University with a B.S. in Business Administration, and later an MBA from Hofstra University. He continued on to complete the Harvard Business School Executive Program. John began his distinguished business career at The General Foods Corporation, and was also a part-time professor in the School of Business at St. Johns University. Later, he joined the J. Walter Thompson agency in Chicago. John joined The Coca-Cola Company in 1974. He was truly one of the great leaders of the company where he operated closely with Roberto Goizueta and Donald Keough through the 80s and 90s as Coca-Cola catapulted to one of the largest multinational corporations in the world. John played a significant role in helping Coke grow and expand its international business where he was named President of Coca-Cola International in 1986. Prior, as President of the Pacific Region in 1981, he was recognized as the man who turned around the Coca-Cola business in the Pacific Rim, particularly Japan, one of Coke's most important markets. He was lovingly known there as ""Kaicho"" (Chairman). He continued to lead strong market growth in Thailand, Korea, and Philippines and opened the negotiations in the People's Republic of China with General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other Ministers of the Republic. He worked closely with Dr. Henry Kissinger who was an advisor for Coke. In China, one of his great successes was officiating the opening of more than a dozen of Coke's Bottling and Concentrate plants - the rebirth of Coca-Cola in China. Thereafter, Coke began an umbrella joint venture with CITIC and BC Development where John was Vice-Chairman.

In crediting the developer, Stanley Selengut, the author pointed at the courage it took to undertake this model, then new, for green tourism. The article missed an opportunity however, to compliment the creativity of the architect, Jim Hadley, in defining a solution that has become the model for others, now so obvious as to lose distinction.

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"WHEN I was growing up in Austin, Tex., ours was one of those families Coloradans so justly revile, who took yearly ski trips to Snowmass or Vail, dressing to the nines in fancy gear and crowding the ski slopes. We usually went at around Christmastime, starting when I was probably 5 or 6. I spent at least half of every vacation in ski school while my parents took off on their own, over the years progressing from the snow plow to parallel skiing, from the bunny slopes to, eventually, the odd black diamond trail. I became a pretty good skier, never super-fast or aggressive, but with decent form and control. The Christmas after I turned 10, that good form got me assigned to a class more chock-full than the usual with Hotshots. If you've ever been skiing you know the type, and most likely loathe them: those 11- or 12-year-old boys with helmets, belligerent expressions and a tendency to move in packs. They tear down mountains curled into near-fetal positions over their skis with their poles tucked under their armpits, attempting ill-advised jumps, shouting ''On your right!'' (I am probably showing my age here; nowadays the little punks are probably all on snowboards.)"

NANCY MEYERS may be a singular figure in Hollywood -- may, in fact, be the most powerful female writer-director-producer currently working (not that there's much competition) -- but that doesn't appear to give the 60-year-old blonde a whole lot of social clout. On a Monday evening in late October, for instance, it didn't stop the owner of Vincenti, a small, much-in-demand Italian eatery in Brentwood, from asking Meyers whether she would mind switching tables come 8 p.m. True, ours was a prime corner booth, and the owner, a fierce-looking woman with coal-black hair who would fit nicely into a Fellini film, assured Meyers that she was only being asked this favor because the person who requested the table was an investor in the restaurant. (He turned out to be Howard Weitzman, a lawyer whose clients have included O. J. Simpson and Michael Jackson.) But it still gave me pause. You know, the whole sexual-politics thing rearing its timeworn, fractious head: a powerful man trumps any woman. (''When you describe how influential I am in Hollywood,'' Meyers ruefully observed to me, ''say we were thrown out of our booth.'') As we got up to move at the appointed hour, John Burnham, an agent and executive vice president at International Creative Management and an old friend of hers who happened to be sitting at the table next to ours, expressed outrage on our behalf, offering to confront the owner personally.

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"The omnibus government spending bill signed into law last week contains an important victory for public health. Gone is all spending for highly restrictive abstinence-only sex education programs that deny young people accurate information about contraceptives, sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. The measure redirects sex-education resources to medically sound programs aimed at reducing teenage pregnancy. Federal support for the wishful abstinence-only approach, which began in the 1980s, ballooned during George W. Bush's presidency. As the funding grew, so did evidence of the policy's failure. A Congressionally mandated study released in 2007 found that elementary and middle school students who received abstinence instruction were just as likely to have sex in the following year as students who did not get such instruction."

I knew from windsurfing magazines that Bonaire was great for windsurfing. But my girlfriend is a diver, so she was really excited about going scuba diving and snorkeling there. I'd never snorkeled before, and I loved it. It was great because it was so accessible. You could go right off the beach anywhere on the island and get to the reef really easily to see all the coral and tropical fish and all these Christmas tree worms, which are these beautiful, spirally creatures. There were a few spots where a huge school would completely surround you, and you'd be in this river of blue and purple fish.

A lifelong association with the Fountain Valley School in Colorado Springs began in 1949 when he was hired as a Spanish teacher. After three years at the school he moved to New York City and began working for Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, rising to the position of Account Manager. He pursued his love of drawing at the Art Students League of New York. In 1966 he earned a Masters Degree in English at New York University and returned to teaching at Fountain Valley. As a teacher of English, Spanish, photography, and drama, he recognized the potential of young people and nurtured their talents. He gained the affection and friendship of hundreds of students who became lifelong friends. In 1982 Hunter and Lynn moved to southern Connecticut, where he taught photography for ten years at the Silvermine Guild Arts Center in New Canaan, Ct. Many of his photographs hung in galleries and juried competitions. A lover of the theater, Hunter acted in numerous productions, including the role of Norman Thayer, Jr. in On Golden Pond. In 1992 Hunter and Lynn returned to Colorado Springs. He wrote several books, including Around the World with No Hassles and a biography of the artist Boardman Robinson.

And so he has, introducing a five-week class called ''iPhone Art'' at his nonprofit arts education organization. ''I wanted everyone to shut up already about what their iPhone could do and show me what it actually does,'' said Mr. Nourse, 37, a video artist and photographer who moved to Chicago in 1996."

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Some Chicagoans grouse that President Obama has reneged on promises to return home regularly. Midway through a desultory, prickly United States Senate debate last week, I realized he might need to get back to help save his old seat for Democrats. It's almost as though the seat was covered by a secret term-limits restriction. Since 1992 we've had Alan J. Dixon, Carol Moseley Braun, Peter G. Fitzgerald, Mr. Obama and now Roland W. Burris, whose mediocrity and conceit helped make his selection by then-Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich so unseemly. Confronting doubts about his candor and fund-raising prospects, Mr. Burris opted not to run for a full term, though he can joyously engrave ''U.S. Senator, 2009-2010'' on the large mausoleum he has already built for himself in Oak Woods Cemetery."

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Your new memoir, ''A Simple Christmas,'' avoids the subject of presidential races and your decade as governor of Arkansas in favor of earlier trials, like your fervent campaign as an 11-year-old to persuade your parents to buy you an electric guitar that you had spotted in a J. C. Penney Christmas catalog. What do you think of the gifts topping this year's lists? I am afraid to ask what they are. Mostly electronics -- digital cameras, iPods, video-game consoles. I'm not against gifts that entertain, but I really believe that some of the most valuable gifts that we can give are the things that help us to develop a skill and be entertaining. I'm a strong advocate for music. I think guitars are wonderful. Keyboards -- there are a lot of keyboards that are very affordable these days, and they're so versatile."
2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"IS it coincidence that ''Up in the Air'' and ''The Messenger'' -- the two films that best captured a sense of what it was really like to live in the United States the year the bottom almost fell out -- focus on men whose job it is to deliver very bad news to strangers? With its wisecracks and tart screwball banter between Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a termination facilitator hired by companies to do their downsizing dirty work, and his fellow frequent flier and sometime lover Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), ''Up in the Air'' has the trappings of a romantic comedy. But as Bingham dispassionately fires longtime employees played by actual victims of downsizing, what emerges is an indelible collective portrait of the chilly impersonality of American corporate life in the 21st century. In a shark-infested sink-or-swim culture where profits and stock price are everything, the bottom line trumps human values."

(More commonly, ''famous-faced.'') It can be a bit of a Faustian bargain. While still writing for Johnny Carson on ''The Tonight Show'' and while dropping that day's monologue jokes on his desk, I asked if he'd like to join me to go see something -- in public -- that I knew would interest him. Memory has swallowed whatever it was, but it doesn't matter. What I remember is his somewhat poignant answer: ''I'd love to go there with you, Richard. But with this face?'' On the other hand, when Jack Benny first came on a show of mine and I suddenly blurted, ''Isn't it a drag, Jack? Constant recognition?,'' to my surprise he blurted back, ''I like being famous!'' A rare admission at any time. He elaborated: ''I go to a night club, I get a good table. I go to the theater, I get the best seats. At the country club, the steam room attendant gives me the best towel.'' Then came, delightfully, ''And ya know, kid, what the best part is? People are generally glad to see me.''"

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"WE end this extraordinary financial year with news that the Treasury is in discussions with American International Group about selling the taxpayers' 80 percent ownership stake in that company. The government recently permitted several banks to break free of its potential oversight by repaying loans made during the rescue. But with respect to A.I.G., the Treasury should not move so fast. There is one job left to do. A.I.G. was at the center of the web of bad business judgments, opaque financial derivatives, failed economics and questionable political relationships that set off the economic cataclysm of the past two years. When A.I.G.'s financial products division collapsed -- ultimately requiring a federal bailout of $180 billion -- those who had been prospering from A.I.G.'s schemes scurried for taxpayer cover. Yet, more than a year after the rescue began, crucial questions remain unanswered. Who knew what, and when? Who benefited, and by exactly how much? Would A.I.G.'s counterparties have failed without taxpayer support?"

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Robin Beaulieu was telling me about her daughter's bike accident. It was an event that would force Beaulieu not only to confront the death of her child but also to embrace a new way of dying. We were sitting last spring in the kitchen of her small apartment in Manchester, N.H. Beaulieu took a drag on a Marlboro, poured a cup of coffee and told me that her daughter, Amanda Panzini, had been a rambunctious, bighearted teenager. She loved animals, even ''flea-ridden, mangy dogs,'' Beaulieu said, and was a fiercely loyal friend. When confronted by the possibility of donating her brain-injured daughter's organs after the accident, Beaulieu never doubted that Amanda would have wanted them to go to someone who needed them. But Amanda first had to be declared dead, and in her case, the only way that could happen was if her parents chose a precisely choreographed death -- one conducted by medical personnel in a hospital procedure meant to allow Amanda to die while preserving her organs. From this, the doctors and Beaulieu hoped, would come new life. The last time Beaulieu talked to her daughter was on the morning of June 21, 2008, a Saturday. Amanda attended an eighth-grade dance the night before; she told her mother that she had her first kiss there. After Beaulieu left for work at a nearby minimart, Amanda decided to ride her bike a few blocks to her friend Kate's house. She didn't take her helmet. At the crossing of Taylor and Young Streets, a Ford F-150 pickup truck slammed into Amanda and threw her into the street. When the paramedics arrived, Amanda wasn't breathing. They inserted a tube into her windpipe and rushed her to Elliot Hospital nearby. Beaulieu received an emergency call at the minimart; the paramedics had identified Amanda by the name engraved on her iPod."

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"No one likes empty storefronts; they make streets look like gap-toothed smiles. Now that San Francisco's business districts are feeling the economic pinch, city officials, like dentists, have been scouting for ways to fix the cavities. Whether business picks up next year remains to be seen, but in the meantime, civic leaders and neighborhood associations have turned to artists for a temporary solution. The Art in Storefronts initiative, introduced in the fall in San Francisco, is probably the most comprehensive project of its kind in the city. The program, which has received applications from nearly 200 local artists to date, has filled 20 empty commercial storefronts in four areas -- the Tenderloin, Bayview, Central Market and the Mission -- with temporary art installations. Plans are afoot to expand the project to additional neighborhoods like Chinatown."
2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"DURING the past 12 months it has struck me that sometimes the dancer sticks with you as much as the dance. Emmanuel Eggermont, a performer of spellbinding depth, made a particularly imposing appearance in Raimund Hoghe's ''Après-Midi'' at Danspace Project, presented as part of the French Institute Alliance Française's Crossing the Line festival in September. Mr. Eggermont -- his face as smooth as a painting -- evoked the essence of Nijinsky as he moved through a series of positions that flattened his form, twisting and curving his spine in profile, with a sobering radiance. But he wasn't the only faun in town. In April at the Miller Theater, as part of the one-off program celebrating Diaghilev, Michael J. Novak made the air sizzle as the sensual creature in Nijinsky's 1912 ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' a marvel of not just plasticity but penetrating imagination. In another revival, ''Clytemnestra'' (from 1958), performed by the Martha Graham Dance Company at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in May, Fang-Yi Sheu found a role that allowed her to be fierce, vulnerable, enraged and wholly feminine."

I would vote yes knowing that the bill represents the culmination of a struggle begun by Theodore Roosevelt nearly a century ago to make health care reform a reality. And while it does not contain every measure President Obama and I wanted, I would vote yes for this bill certain that it includes the fundamental, essential change that opponents of reform have resisted for generations."

It was from this Gothic-Revival-style house that she used to take off on her bicycle, laden with 50 pounds of equipment, to photograph fishmongers, bootblacks and other working people. It was on the front lawn that she used to dance wildly with her female friends. Even more scandalous, she took pictures of herself with a cigarette stuck in her mouth."

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Service at the calm and cozy hideaway Star Bar Ginza, which opened in 2000, is friendly, but don't be deceived: there are few bars that take their craft more seriously. You might call Hisashi Kishi, the owner (below), the Einstein of bartenders; he is the director of technical research for the Nippon Bartenders Association (he writes recipes for their official cocktail book), a former International Bar Association world champion and the youngest-ever winner of the national Scotch cocktail competition. (A former Star Bar bartender, Hidetsugu Ueno, is the international director of the bartenders association and has opened Bar High Five nearby, at 4F No. 26 Polestar Building, 7-2-14 Ginza.) Take Mr. Kishi's signature cocktail, the Sidecar. His method is simple yet scientific: he froths the Cognac and triple sec together to blend and soften the ingredients and elicit the aromas. Next, as Mr. Ueno described it, comes ''Kishi's own style of hard shake,'' a series of short, vigorous figure-eight movements. And if you ask for ice in your cocktail, expect one large, perfectly hand-carved ice cube, crystal-clear and glossy; it chills the drink without melting too fast. (At the end of the bar, near a dry-cured leg of ham, is a magazine, published by Junpyo, the Japanese Icemakers Union, which features a photo of Mr. Kishi.)"

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"SO many bookstalls still carry tributes to Michael Jackson that we're constantly reminded that 2009 brought his death. Thanks to video, his dancing -- best in the years before he became a bizarre self-parody -- stays remarkable. What sticks in my head most is not his famous moonwalk but the way in which, during his 1983 ''Billie Jean'' performance on the ''Motown 25'' television special, he isolates and contrasts the action of either leg, all while making the action of both feet and pelvis vivid. You can watch Jackson on screen and feel you've caught most of what he was about. With other artists no quantity of video or film can compensate us for their deaths. Dance as theater seems altogether smaller with the deaths this year of Pina Bausch and Merce Cunningham, two diametrically different choreographers for whom choreography went way beyond dance making. And it seems unlikely that in 5 or 10 years' time there will be much Bausch or Cunningham work for us to follow in any live repertory."

My sister was serious in her efforts as administrator of the diagnostic tool, but my family prizes a wisecrack over a felt sentiment any day of the week.

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Imagine that the climate summit conference in Copenhagen this weekend was not a gathering of nations. Imagine a gathering of delegates from the many ages of a single nation. The fault lines would not be India and China versus the global rich, but rather China 1800 versus China 1978 versus China 2100. It would be a negotiation not between different lands but between different historical facts, different levels of survivalism. The Copenhagen meeting is an unimaginably complex negotiation among countries; the difficulties it has faced in reaching for broad approval of a global agreement are hard to overstate. But if the conference were interpreted through a chronological, not geopolitical, lens, those difficulties could perhaps come more into focus -- as a contest between the rival ideas of life and obligation that societies possess at different moments in their modernizing odysseys. Sitting at one side of the negotiating table are Western great powers at the postmodern edge of modernization. Sitting across are developing nations decades, even centuries, behind in affluence, nutrition, literacy and urbanization; striving to catch up, they are less enthusiastic about crimping economic growth to cool a warming planet."

You'll find the latter at Bali's many streetside food vendors known as warungs. Scattered throughout Indonesia, warungs usually occupy a modest shack or roadside lean-to with a small counter and a bench where customers sit and eat traditional dishes.

It's hand played, by a band complete with a horn section, rather than programmed. It's so improvisatory that melodies change from verse to verse. And even when the rhythm gets funky, the sad, lovely songs -- about a crumbling romance -- are suffused with a yearning that's almost too intimate. It's soul music reinventing itself, moment to moment. 2. ANIMAL COLLECTIVE ''Merriweather Post Pavilion'' (Domino) Synthesized jubilation runs through this dizzying album. Echoes are everywhere: loops pile on loops in iridescent patterns; percussion crackles and rattles; and vocals cascade across it all.

Is it dance? Is it theater? Is it performance art? Does it matter? Not in years like this one. Few artists make categories seem as happily irrelevant as Paul Lazar and Annie-B Parson of Big Dance Theater in their exquisitely constructed collaborations. I reviewed their Orestes as theater, but the work, which ran at the Classic Stage Company in the spring, is a choreographic knockout as well, one that has grown more resonant for me as the months have passed."

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"CREATING a dance involves much more than inventing steps for dancers. It needs a judicious eye for visual and spatial effect, a sense of timing and an instinct for building attention, for varying the mood and creating an overall theatrical arc that draws an audience into the world of the dance. Thinking about my favorite dance watching moments of the year, I realized that they all involved a sense of wonder at the skill with which the choreographers had woven these elements into a whole, making every aspect of a dance feel not just necessary, but inevitable. 1.William Forsythe's 1984 ARTIFACT is a four-act ballet that evokes both traditional 19th-century form (characters, narrative, a large corps de ballet, the equivalent of a ''white'' act) and Balanchinian abstraction. Brilliantly performed by the Royal Ballet of Flanders in Ludwigshafen, Germany, in November, it showed itself also as a viscerally thrilling celebration of classical dance and a demonstration of the way that Mr. Forsythe has extended that vocabulary and changed our expectations of what a ballet can be."

A couple of lonely plants are little relief against a monotony of hard, easy-clean surfaces.

With six zones -- some international, some domestic -- spread across two low-ceilinged, ill-lighted terminals whose depths often block cellphone signals, travelers require a virtual Ph.D. in urban spelunking to navigate. And that's if you're a New Yorker. If you've come from Miami, Madrid or Moscow, and perhaps speak less than fluent English, the arrivals areas can be as opaque as a graffiti-scarred cinderblock wall. How do I get into the city? Where's my luggage? Where's the bathroom? Where's my daughter? The answers to these questions can flummox even the savviest travelers."

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"In Limbo, where I've so often spent the holidays, I sat down last year in front of my computer on the night before the night before Christmas and tried to soothe my balsam-scented loneliness by reaching out to my newfound social network (''social networks'' being what we have now in place of ''friends and families''). Outside, in the streets of my snowy Montana hometown, noisy drinkers were strolling from bar to bar as I typed out the sad word ''Facebook'' on my keyboard and scanned my screen for familiar names and pictures. I didn't find many for the simple reason that I was a novice at silicon socializing, and 90 percent of the people I knew on Facebook were people I didn't know at all. The truth was that my social network wasn't mine. The month before, in a rush to join modernity in time for the publication of a new book, I raided the pages of three well-connected colleagues, looking for literary types who might be inclined to accept the overtures of a publicity-hungry writer. The result was a group of more than 300 contacts who were, to me, something between total strangers and high-tech ghosts -- although I did have extensive information about their tastes in books, music and movies."

After more than a decade of design and construction delays, Zaha Hadid completed her Maxxi contemporary art museum in Rome, one of the most architecturally ambitious projects to rise there since the work for the 1960 Olympics, when Pier Luigi Nervi completed his Palazzetto dello Sport. The museum's sinuous concrete forms, which seem to draw energy from the surrounding streets, play a game of hide and seek with the neighborhood. Tucked mid-block between rows of nondescript buildings, it is less about the hard sell than the slow seduction."

When the revamped hall opened in February, the priorities became clear: Now it has a beautiful public space (mostly a restaurant) and a rich new veneer. But what had been Lincoln Center's most comfortable hall, and the least problematic acoustically (it had been a little dry), was transformed into a space that feels cramped and industrial, and has virtually no acoustical resonance. For fans of early music the Boston Early Music Festival, held every other year in June, is something like heaven. Not only is there a week of performances -- starting before noon and, some days, running past midnight -- that draw on both well-traveled areas and obscure corners of the medieval-through-early-Classical repertory, but there is also an exhibition (really a trade show) at which instrument builders, publishers and record companies show their wares."

Happily, the modish Denit is a budget hotel, and even better, it underscores that affordability need not come at the expense of smart design and attentive service. Perhaps that's because Denit, which opened in November, is owned by Majestic Hotel Group, which, besides the Montalembert in Paris, also runs several upscale hotels in Barcelona. Denit's stark white, minimalist décor is more Jetsons chic than plush, but in Barcelona that's just right. After all, visitors to the high-design, out-until-dawn city rarely linger in their hotels."

DRAKE ''So Far Gone'' (mixtape; octobersveryown.net) It's not interesting because it's a self-released mixtape, or because he's a former Canadian child actor, though knowing those things makes the achievement of this record that much more impressive and unlikely. It's that Drake is an architecturally precise rapper and a plaintive singer all in one, a combination others have tried and failed at. More important, it's that this collection of songs about fame and love, and how the two don't play well together, is cocksure but still poignant. 2. GIRLS ''Album'' (True Panther/Matador) The first album from the San Francisco duo Girls stings like a fresh scrape -- exposed, glistening, eventually giving way to a scab that falls off, imperfectly healed.

My brother, Fred, then in high school in Worcester, Mass., where we lived, brought home a glamorous, female mannequin's hand that he'd found in a department store's garbage bin. To my preadolescent eyes, the hand's elegant, poised fingers were the very height of sophistication: Faye Dunaway reaches for a Jordan almond.

In putting together my annual list of highlights, I noticed that most of them -- actually, all of them -- were productions that arrived with little or no fanfare and nary a big-name celebrity, yet somehow beat the odds to become the little shows that could. Not that these memorable productions were audience blockbusters. By ''little shows that could'' I mean little shows that could win the hearts of dedicated theater audiences not entirely attuned to the TMZ ethos that has begun to rule Broadway. Fewer than half of my favorite shows of the year were seen in that dubious and increasingly star-obsessed promised land. And while the shows produced off Broadway that made my list all had extended runs, none of the Broadway shows could even remotely be called a hit."

But exactly how to pare down the use of fossil fuels and switch to energy sources derived from plant material? That is the problem."

The American premiere of ''In Vain,'' an opulent, kaleidoscopic masterpiece by the Austrian composer Georg Friedrich Haas, proved an exhilarating experience in February, when Michel Galante led the Argento Chamber Ensemble in a vivid performance of the hourlong score at the Miller Theater. Both musicians and audience were sometimes submerged in darkness, adding to the eerie theatrical effect. Also satisfying on every level was Patrice Chéreau's moving production of Janacek's ''From the House of the Dead'' at the Metropolitan Opera in November, with Esa-Pekka Salonen making a notable house debut in the pit, leading a stellar cast that included the baritone Peter Mattei.

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"If anything is guaranteed to annoy a lexicographer, it is the journalistic habit of starting a story with a dictionary definition. ''According to Webster's,'' begins a piece, blithely, and the lexicographer shudders, because she knows that a dictionary is about to be invoked as an incontrovertible authority. Although we may profess to believe, as the linguist Dwight Bolinger once put it, that dictionaries ''do not exist to define but to help people grasp meanings,'' we don't often act on that belief. Typically we treat a definition as the final arbiter of meaning, a scientific pronouncement of a word's essence. But the traditional dictionary definition, although it bears all the trappings of authority, is in fact a highly stylized, overly compressed and often tentative stab at capturing the consensus on what a particular word ''means.'' A good dictionary derives its reputation from careful analysis of examples of words in use, in the form of sentences, also called citations. The lexicographer looks at as many citations for each word as she can find (or, more likely, can review in the time allotted) and then creates what is, in effect, a dense abstract, collapsing into a few general statements all the ways in which the word behaves. A definition is as convention-bound as a sonnet and usually more compact. Writing one is considered, at least by anyone who has ever tried it, something of an art."

No guidebook mentions the Christmas lights in Maspeth, Queens. And unless you have a reason to stroll through the neighborhood, you may never notice that what looks like one big, brightly festooned house on 60th Road by 69th Street is, in fact, four homes -- turn-of-the-century brick bungalows united by common walls and illuminated snowflakes."

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"IT was, readers of The New York Times recently learned, a very good year for Paramount Pictures. Two of the year's biggest hits, ''G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra'' and ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,'' have helped the studio climb out of its financial hole with a combined domestic take of more than $500 million. Both movies are deeply stupid, often incoherent and hinged on the principle that the spectacle of violence is its own pleasurable end. ''Transformers'' is also casually racist. But hey, that's entertainment. Or, more specifically, that's Hollywood entertainment in the conglomerate age. The major studios have long been in the business of serving sludge to the world, but now the reek often spreads around the globe simultaneously with massive coordinated openings. ''Revenge of the Fallen,'' for instance, opened the same day on more than 4,000 screens in the United States -- about a 10th of all the screens in the country -- and soon about 10,000 more abroad. ''Angels & Demons,'' the sequel to ''The Da Vinci Code,'' opened on some 3,500 screens domestically and ate up more than 10,000 internationally. The French film ''Summer Hours,'' meanwhile, the best-reviewed release in The Times that weekend, opened on two screens."

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"WHEN times are hard, people go to the movies to escape. Like most truisms, this sturdy kernel of Hollywood ideology turns out, on closer examination, not to be entirely true. The urge to escape is powerful, but it also has a way of subverting itself. We may flee to the multiplex or the Netflix queue hoping to escape troubles at home or out there in the world, but those troubles have a habit of following us on our adventures, popping up in our fantasies and haunting our bedtime stories. That happens at the movies -- where action extravaganzas and animated spectacles mutate into allegories of imperial war, social injustice or ecological catastrophe -- and also, on notable occasions this year, in the movies, where escape hatches and psychic emergency exits are frequently blocked, and the repressed returns as if on cue. Our heroes and heroines strike out in search of a different reality, and filmmakers are increasingly able to oblige them, building far-flung new universes and worlds inside of worlds. But though our movie avatars can travel freely through time and space, skipping over metaphysical borders with digitally enabled ease, they are more often than not trapped in uncomfortable circumstances, perilous predicaments or their own heads."

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"GEORGAS--John William. John William Georgas passed away on November 21, 2009 at age 81. Born January 14, 1928 in Long Island, New York, He was the son of William John Georgas and Helen Laricos Georgas; brother to James Georgas and George Georgas. John was a graduate of Syracuse University with a B.S. in Business Administration, and later an MBA from Hofstra University. He continued on to complete the Harvard Business School Executive Program. John began his distinguished business career at The General Foods Corporation, and was also a part-time professor in the School of Business at St. Johns University. Later, he joined the J. Walter Thompson agency in Chicago. John joined The Coca-Cola Company in 1974. He was truly one of the great leaders of the company where he operated closely with Roberto Goizueta and Donald Keough through the 80s and 90s as Coca-Cola catapulted to one of the largest multinational corporations in the world. John played a significant role in helping Coke grow and expand its international business where he was named President of Coca-Cola International in 1986. Prior, as President of the Pacific Region in 1981, he was recognized as the man who turned around the Coca-Cola business in the Pacific Rim, particularly Japan, one of Coke's most important markets. He was lovingly known there as ""Kaicho"" (Chairman). He continued to lead strong market growth in Thailand, Korea, and Philippines and opened the negotiations in the People's Republic of China with General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other Ministers of the Republic. He worked closely with Dr. Henry Kissinger who was an advisor for Coke. In China, one of his great successes was officiating the opening of more than a dozen of Coke's Bottling and Concentrate plants - the rebirth of Coca-Cola in China. Thereafter, Coke began an umbrella joint venture with CITIC and BC Development where John was Vice-Chairman. An active member of the U.S. China Business Council, John provided guidance to other American businesses seeking better understanding of the PRC. Later, John as President of International was instrumental in the creation of the European Advisory Council. During that time, John became Co-Chairman of Coca-Cola's joint venture with Nestle Refreshment Company (CCNR). John served on numerous national and international Boards, which included: Coca-Cola Amatil Corp in Australia. Coca-Cola Amalgamated Beverages (Coca-Cola Schweppes in the UK), Pernod Ricard, Brucefil Inc., and Chairman of the Japan America Society where he was the recipient of the Mike Mansfield Award. He also served on the Board of Emory University's School of Business and School of Dentistry. He was a large philanthropist with great focus on the Greek Orthodox Church and charities. His endowments included a scholarship fund for the Hellenic College of Holy Cross in Brookline Ma, the Archbishop Iakavos Library at Holy Cross, Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai, Egypt, and the Leadership 100 Fund. He contributed to the iconography at St. Marks Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Boca Raton, Florida. John was also a large supporter to medicine and education with endowments towards Massachusetts General Hospital, the Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, and Georgetown University's Hellenic Chair and Scholarship Fund. He was co-founder of the International School in Atlanta, Georgia. He was a lover of the arts, and supported the American School of Ballet, and endowed The John and Tarsi Georgas Family Gallery in the Greek and Roman Wing at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. In addition to John's successful professional career, he was known by family and friends as a supportive and loving husband, father and friend. He is survived by his wife, Tarsi; three children: William Georgas, Gregory Georgas, and Laura Georgas Carr; seven grandchildren, John William, Sophia, Tatiana, John Gregory, Zoe, Caroline and Alexis."
2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"The Chicago public schools' response to a recent court desegregation ruling -- a plan to use students' social and economic profiles instead of race to achieve classroom diversity -- is raising fears that it will undermine the district's slow and incremental progress on racial diversity. Chicago schools, like the city itself, are hardly a model of racial integration. But a Chicago News Cooperative analysis of school data shows the district has made modest gains in the magnet, gifted, classical and selective-enrollment schools, where, for nearly 30 years, race has been used as an admission criterion. Those advances may be imperiled in the wake of court rulings that have prompted Chicago Public Schools to look for factors other than race when assigning students to such schools."

He leaves his beloved four sons and one daughter: Mark Ain, Lexington, MA; Brent Ain, Potomac, MD; Ross Ain, Washington, DC; Aron Ain, Newton, MA; and Alice Ain Rich, Weston, MA. He is also survived by 12 loving grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, four daughters-in-law, one son-in-law, two sisters-in-law, nieces and nephews, and many, many dear friends. He was predeceased by his loving wife Pearl Ponemon Ain and siblings Sarah Morenstein and Herbert Ain. He was a graduate of Sea Cliff High School, Class of 1933, and New York University, Class of 1937 where he earned a degree in engineering. Jack lived a full life with his adored wife of 65 years, Pearl, at his side. For over 45 years, he operated a local plumbing and heating supply business that he took over from his father. But his real interests were his family and the charitable organizations to which he gave tirelessly. While Jack was involved in leadership positions with the Lions Club, Congregation Tifereth Israel, the Glen Cove YMCA and many other charitable organizations, the Nassau County Chapter of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children (AHRC) was particularly special to him. He served as a board member and leader of AHRC for many decades. In recognition of his dedication to providing assistance to individuals with developmental disabilities, the AHRC opened the Pearl and Jack Ain Advantage Care Diagnostic and Treatment Center on its Brookville, NY campus in 2005 through a lead gift provided by Pearl and Jack. He was committed to his community and energized by working to make the world a better place. He will be remembered as a man who cared deeply about his family and made a difference by helping those who needed assistance to lead productive and meaningful lives.

The same week President Obama chided ''fat cat bankers'' for raising their pay in tough times, the last of the big banks to take bailout money said they were moving to repay billions that had propped them up -- and free themselves of the restrictions on pay that came with the money. Perhaps no moment better captured the shift in power from Washington, where it had tilted during the dark days of last autumn, back to its historic center. After the meltdown, many had hoped policy makers would rewrite the rules for the financial industry. Now, nearly all of the biggest banks have wiggled out from under Uncle Sam's thumb.

What distinguishes Calder from these other giants of art history may be his extraordinary versatility as an artist. Calder was primarily a sculptor. Soon after moving to Paris in 1926, he met Fernand Léger, Piet Mondrian, Pablo Picasso and other members of the European avant-garde and developed a body of inventive sculpture that owes much to Surrealism, especially the work of the Spanish artist Joan Miró. It was also in Paris that he took up printmaking, after befriending Stanley William Hayter, an expatriate British artist and influential printmaker. It was to remain a lifelong passion."

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"The subjective nature of the value of things dominated 2009, from earnest tomes about rethinking materialism to breathless scrutiny of holiday sales reports. But surely the most jarring take has come by way of the A&E reality show ''Hoarders.'' Nobody could doubt that its subjects, trapped in a debilitating mire of possessions, have lost all perspective on the matter. Even they know it. Patty, a trim, well-dressed 48-year-old mother, weeps with shame as she shows the cameras her young daughter's bedroom, heaped with clothes and other spoils of her constant shopping expeditions to the point that little space remained for the actual child. The whole (huge) house looks like this, rendered practically unlivable by precarious piles of possessions. Which is why authorities have in fact taken away her children, and she is trying to get her life back in order, on television. ''Hoarders'' isn't about people who are simply messy or like stuff. As every episode of the series announces at the start: ''Compulsive hoarding is a mental disorder.'' I can't be the only person who squirms at that disclaimer: I am about to watch people with a disorder, suffering. Nevertheless the show is popular: the first episodes ran this summer, and the first installment in its 13-show second season was broadcast on Nov. 30, attracting its largest audience to date: 3.2 million viewers.

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"AS we say farewell to a dreadful year and decade, this much we can agree upon: The person of the year is not Ben Bernanke, no matter how insistently Time magazine tries to hype him into its pantheon. The Fed chairman was just as big a schnook as every other magical thinker in Washington and on Wall Street who believed that housing prices would go up in perpetuity to support an economy leveraged past the hilt. Unlike most of the others, it was Bernanke's job to be ahead of the curve. Yet as recently as June of last year he could be found minimizing the possibility of a substantial economic downturn. And now we're supposed to applaud him for putting his finger in the dike after disaster struck? This is defining American leadership down. If there's been a consistent narrative to this year and every other in this decade, it's that most of us, Bernanke included, have been so easily bamboozled. The men who played us for suckers, whether at Citigroup or Fannie Mae, at the White House or Ted Haggard's megachurch, are the real movers and shakers of this century's history so far. That's why the obvious person of the year is Tiger Woods. His sham beatific image, questioned by almost no one until it collapsed, is nothing if not the farcical reductio ad absurdum of the decade's flimflams, from the cancerous (the subprime mortgage) to the inane (balloon boy)."

THE RUN was the honorary title given to a pickup basketball game that has met weekly for more than three decades, generally followed by a bite to eat; it was started by writers in 1977 but came to attract veterans of competitive college and professional teams. Its official name was the Writers League, and it included Jay Acton, the literary agent for James Baldwin, and Bob Ward, who worked on ''Hill Street Blues'' and ''Miami Vice.'' The game started in the Village Preparatory School on West 10th Street, but moved in 1980 to Xavier High School (also in the Village), and more recently was at Nightingale-Bamford on the Upper East Side.

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Regarding ''Brad Pitt's Gifts to New Orleans'' (Nov. 29): Katrina did not directly hit the New Orleans metropolitan area. The major cause of the devastation in the Ninth Ward and other areas of New Orleans was a result of the faulty design, construction and neglect of the levee system by the Army Corps of Engineers. The American Society of Civil Engineers has confirmed this. And, more recently, Judge Stanwood R. Duval Jr. of Federal District Court ruled on Nov. 18, 2009, that the Army Corps of Engineers' mismanagement of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet was directly responsible for flood damage of homes in St. Bernard Parish and the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. The judge ruled that the corps' activities allowed the channel to double its width, failed to protect the channel's banks against ship wakes and allowed saltwater to exacerbate the loss of wetlands in the area."
2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"It was only when Fred R. Shapiro, the editor of the Yale Book of Quotations, reviewed his annual list of the year's most notable utterances that he detected an unexpected pattern -- a disproportionate number of South Carolinians. Three of the Top 10 ''most famous or important or revealing'' quotations of 2009 came, he realized, from the same relatively small state. Coincidence? Probably not after the year that South Carolina has endured. Measured in political scandals and sustained media scrutiny, 2009 was the Year of South Carolina. Consider Mr. Shapiro's list: at the top was ''Keep your government hands off my Medicare,'' a line delivered by a town-hall attendee in Simpsonville. (The state's health-care town halls were among the nation's rowdiest.) The second entry, ''You lie!,'' was shouted atPresident Obama by RepresentativeJoe Wilson of South Carolina during the president's address to Congress; it, too, concerned health care. And the third, ''The governor is hiking the Appalachian Trail,'' was declared (perhaps wishfully) by a spokesman for South Carolina's governor,Mark Sanford, who was actually in Argentina conducting an extramarital affair."

2009-12-20T00:00:00Z,"WHEN I was growing up in Austin, Tex., ours was one of those families Coloradans so justly revile, who took yearly ski trips to Snowmass or Vail, dressing to the nines in fancy gear and crowding the ski slopes. We usually went at around Christmastime, starting when I was probably 5 or 6. I spent at least half of every vacation in ski school while my parents took off on their own, over the years progressing from the snow plow to parallel skiing, from the bunny slopes to, eventually, the odd black diamond trail. I became a pretty good skier, never super-fast or aggressive, but with decent form and control. The Christmas after I turned 10, that good form got me assigned to a class more chock-full than the usual with Hotshots. If you've ever been skiing you know the type, and most likely loathe them: those 11- or 12-year-old boys with helmets, belligerent expressions and a tendency to move in packs. They tear down mountains curled into near-fetal positions over their skis with their poles tucked under their armpits, attempting ill-advised jumps, shouting ''On your right!'' (I am probably showing my age here; nowadays the little punks are probably all on snowboards.)"

The creative director, Rosita Missoni, designed the property, mixing a stark black-and-white palette with bright bursts of color, like purple glass walls, blood-orange hallways and symmetrically striped carpeting. The brand's classic colorful textiles play especially well here; somehow, even the doormen's Chevron zig-zag kilts seem not a thread overworked in a city of somber gray stone and black medieval spires. My standard room, which came with free Wi-Fi and an espresso machine, was dressed in an ensemble of lacquered ruby, robin's egg blue, lemongrass and moss green. And mixed into the kaleidoscope were mirrors, silver leather and black-and-white fringe curtains - all of it somehow relaxing rather than seizure inducing."

Chait argues that the Republicans could have sold moderate Democrats on a ""vastly more limited"" piece of legislation, if they'd been willing to compromise early in the process. Instead, by uniting in lockstep opposition and gambling that the difficulties of getting to sixty would doom the Democratic effort, the G.O.P. has ensured that ""they'll walk away with nothing.""

Loving husband of Carolyn Aldrich Frost, beloved father and father-in-law of Daniel and Kathryn Frost, William Frost, and Juliana Frost, doting grandfather of Sarah Frost, Elizabeth Frost, and Kaleb Beavers, and loving brother of William Frost (deceased) and Stevens L. Frost. Hunter was born in New York City and grew up in Pleasantville, NY. He graduated from Bowdoin College in Maine in 1948, after serving in the U. S. Army. A lifelong association with the Fountain Valley School in Colorado Springs began in 1949 when he was hired as a Spanish teacher. After three years at the school he moved to New York City and began working for Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, rising to the position of Account Manager. He pursued his love of drawing at the Art Students League of New York. In 1966 he earned a Masters Degree in English at New York University and returned to teaching at Fountain Valley. As a teacher of English, Spanish, photography, and drama, he recognized the potential of young people and nurtured their talents. He gained the affection and friendship of hundreds of students who became lifelong friends. In 1982 Hunter and Lynn moved to southern Connecticut, where he taught photography for ten years at the Silvermine Guild Arts Center in New Canaan, Ct. Many of his photographs hung in galleries and juried competitions. A lover of the theater, Hunter acted in numerous productions, including the role of Norman Thayer, Jr. in On Golden Pond. In 1992 Hunter and Lynn returned to Colorado Springs. He wrote several books, including Around the World with No Hassles and a biography of the artist Boardman Robinson. A celebration of Hunter's life is tentatively planned for the end of May, 2010 in Colorado Springs.

2009-12-21T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (Sundance) RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: PRIMA DONNA Mr. Wainwright, above, the singer, has said in interviews that writing songs is like a long preparation for writing an opera. This documentary from George Scott (''Somebody Told Me About ... Carla Bruni'') follows Mr. Wainwright as he tackles his first opera project, ''Prima Donna,'' which was initially commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera and Lincoln Center Theater. The Manchester International Festival rescued the work after the Met withdrew because Mr. Wainwright insisted on writing the opera in French and the Met's general manager, Peter Gelb, preferred English. When the work had its premiere in Manchester in July, Anthony Tommasini, in The New York Times, wrote, ''Some of the most captivating moments are the simplest musically.'' Yet, he said, ''there are places where Mr. Wainwright's compositional skills seem lacking.'' The opera ends with a tender aria, ''a long-spun melody with a gentle accompaniment riff: in other words, a Wainwright song,'' he continued. ''Would that there had been more of them.'' Mr. Wainwright's parents, Anna McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III; his co-librettist and longtime friend, Bernadette Colomine; his partner, the theater producer Jörn Weisbrodt; and the soprano Renée Fleming offer their perspectives. 7 P.M.

2009-12-22T00:00:00Z,"HIRSCH--Morton P.E.,Educator, Entrepreneur, Inventor, Manufacturer and Fire Protection Pioneer, dies at 73. Morton (Morti) Hirsch P.E. of New York City, passed away on Friday, December 18, 2009 while conducting business in Florida. His illustrious career was known worldwide by members of the fire protection community. He founded the Active Fire Sprinkler Corporation in 1964 and grew it to be one of the largest and most formidable sprinkler contracting firms in the New York City metropolitan area. Morti's natural mechanical aptitude, further enhanced by his consulting engineering background, merged with his astute business sense on that day in 1964 and the rest is history. Under Morti's watchful eye, Active installed automatic fire sprinklers in some of New York's most prestigious addresses such as The Met Life Building, New York Stock Exchange, Waldorf Astoria and the World Trade Center Twin Towers. Active expanded to meet the market demand of the day as Morti planned his next strategy for growth into other geographical markets. He opened the Florida Automatic Sprinkler Company to address the demand for life safety in residential high rises in the South Florida region. He next directed his attention to the manufacturing sector where he became a partner in the Globe Fire Sprinkler Corporation of Standish, Michigan. He continued to serve on the Board of Directors at Globe while establishing patents to further the growth of fire sprinkler systems worldwide. Morti held New York Licenses in Plumbing and Fire Protection which led him into his next adventure and one of his true passions, teaching. He became known within the New York construction trades as an expert in interpretation and application of New York City Building and Fire Codes. His expertise continued to be sought after by property owners, general contractors and State and local fire officials. Typical of Morti's vision for the future, he developed the Active Plumbing Supply Co. to address the need for water conservation through the use of ""low flow"" toilets within the boroughs. He worked tirelessly with the New York City DEP in what became one of the first environmentally conscious programs in the city. He held patents in various areas fluid dynamics, the result of his love for creation which led to invention. He invented the ""Hydro Strut"" which combined a structural steel bar joist system with the piping distribution mains in order to gain efficiencies while lowering material costs for the overall project. Morti's support of the construction trade associations was known internationally. He chaired and presided over more associations than can be named in order to further the required collaboration to advance the fire sprinkler concept. He continued to be an active member of the NFPA, NFSA, AFSA, SFPE, ASPE, ASSE, NYFSCA, NYFSDA, MCA, BOMA as well as an avid supporter of Enterprise Association Local 638 (Steam Fitters and Pipe Fitters) of New York City. Morti's support of Jewish organizations was appreciated by all. He supported various Foundations, including the Labvitch of Brooklyn of which he was very proud. He was honored as Man of the Year by The Ner Tamid Society, honored by National Jewish Life, Misivta Yashiva as well as countless others. His support of civic organizations was also well documented. He was also awarded for continued support by The Boy Scouts of America. Morti was born in Brooklyn, NY on October 26, 1936 to Emanuel and Rose Hirsch and he is survived by his wife Yumi, daughters Eve Hirsch and Ann Hirsch, son Joseph Hirsch and daughter-in-law Caroline Hirsch. Also surviving is his sister Joyce Bass, brother-in-law Norman Bass, niece and nephews Steven, Mitchell and Christine Bass and great-nieces Amanda and Kayla. Also, sister Maxine Casalbore, brother-in-law Robert Casalbore, nephew and niece Craig and Lara Casalbore, great nieces and nephew Magen, Alexander and Matthew, niece Marissa Oddo and great-nephew Michael Oddo.

To the right, the Golden State's ongoing crisis is a case study in liberal failure: A big-spending state that lived far beyond its means, and let its public-policy priorities be dictated by the appetites of liberal interest groups instead of the common good. To the left, it's a case study in how a malign nexus of conservative intransigence and institutional sclerosis can thwart good governance. The problem in California isn't the spending, liberals argue: It's the supermajority requirements that prevent a liberal majority from raising the taxes necessary to pay for it."

At J. Crew, it was as though a bomb had gone off and wrinkled all the clothes. Had the steamer broken? Had they given up and were just heaving the clothes from out of the stock room like water out of a sinking boat?

The show, which closes on Thursday, showcases the artist “using the trees, fields and byways of his native Yorkshire to explore his favorite pictorial equation: illusionistic space confounded by color,” <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/arts/design/18art.html?8ur&emc=ur""> writes Roberta Smith</a>. “With magenta roads often plunging through their centers and dense trees blocking the view, these works depict deep space and also constantly frustrate it.” She adds, “These are goofy, vivacious canvases &#8212; Matisse’s Fauvism on the scale of his late cutouts, with a bow to the Barbizon School &#8212; and, given that combination, unexpectedly strident,” and definitely not to be missed."

Not so long as people can take a seat on a scarlet banquette at his restaurant, sit beneath a towering spray of flowers, and eat sumptuous food out of Escoffier.” When you go, look for “Thackeray characters come to life in a modern age” and revel in the “classic French” cuisine. Begin, as Mr. Sifton suggests, with sweetbreads, “accompanied by a small bit of demi-glace made piney with rosemary, they provide an instant view of a world in which plenty is not nearly so important as quality”; continue with a simple endive salad, beef oxtails of “uncommon excellence,” the Dover sole and a soufflé for dessert.

Weingarten and his online project, 1000 Times Yes. On his Twitter account, twitter.com/1000TimesYes, Mr. Weingarten has been making good on his vow to provide bite-sized reviews of 1,000 albums throughout the year — everything from mainstream releases like Green Day’s “21st Century Breakdown” (which he described as “The Who and Big Country for the fourth generation thinking ‘Blank Generation’ is about them”) to indie-rock offerings like Little Girls’ “Tambourine” (a “blah-punk no-hit wonder,” Mr. Weingarten said). On Tuesday night Mr. Weingarten planned to publish his 1,000th review at precisely midnight. In a telephone interview he said he would continue to write reviews on Twitter next year while he tried to figure out how to capitalize on the buzz he received for the project. “I haven’t figured out anything about it beyond how to get attention,” Mr. Weingarten said. “Which in the Internet is the economy of awesome. And in reality means nothing.”."

Mr. Oswalt will play Sam Truman, a role portrayed by Nathan Lane in the play’s 1991 production for Manhattan Theater Club, and Ms. Mullally will play Chloe Haddock, who was then played by Christine Baranski. The Roundabout production will be directed by Joe Mantello, who directed Mr. McNally’s comedy “The Ritz.” Previews are scheduled to begin on April 9 at the American Airlines Theater, with an official opening on April 29. ... The Tony Award winner Jefferson Mays, along with Elisabeth Waterston and Rocco Sisto, will lead the cast in this winter’s Off Broadway production of Shakespeare’s “Measure for Measure” by Theater for a New Audience, to be directed by Arin Arbus (who directed the company’s acclaimed “Othello” last season). Mr. Mays, who won the Tony for best actor in 2004 and other theater awards for the play “I Am My Own Wife,” will play the Duke in this dark comedy about sexual politics and hypocrisy.

The files, released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request made by several news organizations, describe Mr. Jackson as “a celebrity pop star” and document how the bureau aided California law enforcement agencies when he was investigated for a child molestation case in 1993 that never went to trial and in a second such case from 2004 in which Mr. Jackson was acquitted. The files also describe another child molestation investigation by the bureau in late 2004 that was closed when a witness, the file said, “advised the agents that he had no interest in testifying against” Mr. Jackson and “would legally fight any attempt to do so.”."

2009-12-23T00:00:00Z,"In 1960, George W. Bush shook hands with John F. Kennedy on the campaign trail. Now, at 62, Mr. Bush listens regularly to Rush Limbaugh. ''I was a Democrat before I was a Republican,'' he explained. Like the 43rd president, Mr. Bush, a retired firefighter in Rochester, was named for his father. And like the 43rd president, he is called ''W'' by workers at his local Home Depot, where he is a familiar customer. His W. stands for Wilfred, though, not Walker. ''It's been 75 percent good and 25 percent bad,'' Mr. Bush said of living with a name steeped in politics. For example, when he would call in a pizza order from the firehouse, sometimes the pizza would not be made because the person at the pizza shop presumed it was a joke. ''Yeah, George W. Bush just ordered a pizza. Right. And they would ignore it.'' Mr. Bush continued: ''I can always tell a Democrat from a Republican. The looks on their faces. I can tell you if you're a Democrat or a Republican as soon as I introduce my name.'' Mr. Bush's body language makes subtle reference to an image taken for The Associated Press by Doug Mills, now of The New York Times, on Sept. 11, 2001, at the moment when President Bush learned that a second plane had struck the World Trade Center. A link to that photograph, an audio interview with Mr. Bush, and past presidents in the series are at nytimes.com/lens."

2009-12-24T00:00:00Z,"LUSTERMAN--Seymour, a former public affairs researcher for the Conference Board, and co-author with James K. Brown of the 1971 landmark study of black capitalism, Business and the Development of Ghetto Enterprise, as well as several other seminal works on corporate and public affairs, died Monday, December 14, in Valhalla, New York. He was 90. In 1968, Mr. Lusterman abandoned an established career in advertising and marketing, having served as the first Vice President for Market Research at the Pepsi Cola Company and later as Media Director for the boutique advertising agency, Gumbinner, North, to return to the field of economic research, in which he had earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at New York University in 1940 and the Master of Arts at Columbia University in 1942. Over several decades with the Conference Board, he wrote Educating Students for Work, Education in Industry, Minorities in Engineering, and several other studies of the corporate role in education, health care, and government relations. Seymour Lusterman was born on September 15, 1919 in the Bronx, where he attended public elementary schools and DeWitt Clinton High School. His father, Alexander Lusterman, conducted his dental practice on the Grand Concourse. Beginning in his student days, Mr. Lusterman became active in progressive politics and remained so for many years, volunteering in the Henry Wallace presidential campaign of 1948, among others, and supporting the anti-Vietnam-war platform of presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy in 1968.

The graffiti-streaked cityscape that served as a backdrop contributed to the distinctly twisted flavor of this traditional holiday fare. Backstage, Rachel Ma (below), a dancer, pulled on woolly striped opera gloves that could have doubled as leg warmers.

2009-12-25T23:55:17Z,"Among the many similarities between Pittsburgh and North Carolina, none interests me more than this: neither team cares much for beauty points, opting rather for victory -- no matter how ugly it may be -- at any cost. This mentality paid enormous dividends for Pittsburgh through the season's first 10 games, with three wins in a five-game span coming by single digits. (Unfortunately, Pittsburgh also happened to lose ugly. The Panthers had their hearts broken by last-minute losses to West Virginia and Cincinnati to end the season.) This trend continues with the Tar Heels, winners of four straight from Oct. 29 to Nov. 21, who were dealt a humiliating loss to rival N.C. State to end the season. Which teams will we see on Saturday? The pair that rolled through a stretch of superb play through October and early November, or the teams that fell flat against bitter rivals to end the season?"
2009-12-25T22:01:45Z,"Both Marshall and Ohio entered the 2009 season with similar expectations: bowl eligibility, if not a shot at a conference title. Ohio has fulfilled those expectations -- and then some -- thanks to another sterling coaching job by Frank Solich, who molded a statistically average team into the MAC East champion. Marshall, like Ohio, fulfilled its preseason hopes by reaching bowl play; that's where the similarities end. The Thundering Herd enter the Little Caesars Bowl running on empty, having fired their coach following losses in four of their last six games. On paper, this pits two teams heading in different directions. But as we've seen thus far in bowl season (hello, Wyoming), you'd be wise to expect the unexpected."

But this 500-page novel is, in fact, the perfect companion to take along with you on a trip to Parma, as it evokes the town's seductive quality and offers the tourist a glimpse into its secret soul."

Despite the travails, B.C. has extended its streak of eight-win seasons to nine, with the potential for a sixth straight nine-win campaign with a victory Saturday. What about those Trojans?

2009-12-26T00:00:00Z,"The Cultural Ministry, in an effort to save face after the theft of the infamous ''Arbeit macht frei'' sign that hung over the entrance to the Auschwitz concentration camp, has said it will help pay for more security at the site. The ministry said the government would contribute about $138,000 after a furor over the lack of security at the camp, now a museum. Surveillance cameras at the site were not working properly, and no security personnel were patrolling that part of the grounds when thieves stole the 16-foot sign last week, officials said. The sign was recovered Monday. The government provides more than $3.6 million a year for the museum, but museum officials said that was far too little to maintain the museum and its 500-acre grounds. Personnel costs alone amount to $4.3 million a year, said Jaroslaw Mensfelt, a museum spokesman. He said the additional money would be used for 10 security cameras."

This fall, the chief winemaker behind Cloudy Bay's success began releasing the first vintage under his own label. Greywacke, named after a hard, gray sandstone common in New Zealand, is the fruit of Kevin Judd's ambition to broaden the country's reputation beyond the now-ubiquitous Marlborough sauvignon blanc."

Despite the victory for Al Qaeda, and all the disastrous consequences that followed, the attacks revealed an American talent for personal initiative and innovation -- for acting without reference to higher authority -- that is one of the country's great cultural traits. We saw it best in the smoldering ruins of the World Trade Center. Immediately after the buildings' collapse, thousands of people who had fled or flinched went rushing back into the wreckage to help. Not just the anointed responders of the police and fire departments, but ordinary citizens, and especially construction workers who had the skills to intervene in a practical manner. By nightfall tons of donated emergency supplies were flooding in, and the disaster was being covered in an optimistic embrace. It was simply understood that you would find survivors and the dead, that you would work urgently to clean up the site, and that this would allow New York to remake itself into something greater perhaps even than before."

2009-12-27T00:00:00Z,"Each year newspapers and magazines document the lives and deaths of hundreds of notable people. And each year we put together a special issue that peeks into some of those lives -- an admittedly eclectic, idiosyncratic project, one driven by the passions, quirks and curiosities of our writers and editors. This year those interests led us to some very well known names -- Irving Penn, Robert Novak, Karl Malden, Ted Kennedy -- but also to many lesser-known ones: Peg Mullen, the mother of a soldier killed by friendly fire in Vietnam whose anger and grief turned her into an antiwar activist; Maurizio Montalbini, a sociologist who spent hundreds of days alone in a cave in order to grasp isolation's effects on the body and mind; Naomi Sims, a model and entrepreneur who transcended a difficult childhood to become the first black woman on the cover of a mainstream women's magazine. Thomas Hoving, a former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said before he died of cancer earlier this month: ''I'm a goner but I have no regrets. I've had a terrific life.'' While not everyone can go out with such a sense of resolution, the lives in these pages are worthy, in one way or another, of exploration and appreciation."

2009-12-27T00:00:00Z,"Public life in America has never been gracious or rational, but sometime around 2003 we entered a new era of volatility and virulence. The causes were many. Foremost among them, of course, was the war in Iraq, an adventure that was justified mendaciously and executed incompetently, but may finally introduce an open and self-governing society into the Arab world and confer the blessing of political liberty upon the Shiites, the Sunnis and -- who cannot rejoice over this? -- the Kurds. After ''shock and awe,'' I will never again be shocked and awed; but one's feelings about the origins of the war have no bearing upon one's analysis of its outcome. And after the extreme action came the extreme reaction. George W. Bush espoused the spread of freedom as an objective of American foreign policy, so many of his critics hardened their hearts toward the tyrannized peoples of the world and decided that democratization was another form of imperialism and that the fault for our mistakes lay in our moral vocabulary. ''Realism'' became the slogan of otherwise sensitive souls. Back and forth the debate went, more and more reflexively, more and more soaked in contempt, in a process of Manicheanization (forgive the ugly word, but it describes an ugly thing) that is not yet done."

2009-12-27T00:00:00Z,"JIM KRANTZ, the commercial photographer whose Marlboro ads from the late 1990s were appropriated by Richard Prince, and turned into million-dollar art, is finally getting some recognition -- from the fashion world, at least. Following a project with Adam Kimmel, in which he photographed the designer's spring collection on real cowboys at the ranch in Utah where the original Marlboro ads were shot, Mr. Krantz is having a show at Colette in Paris. Along with his images for Mr. Kimmel, which will be displayed as illuminated light boxes, there will be several landscapes and a series of enlarged portraits taken from a single crowd shot at a bullfight. But it is his cowboy imagery that resonates with fashion folk. ''These guys, in their gear, doing what they do -- there's a definite sense of style,'' Mr. Krantz said. ''They evoke a confidence and a comfort. They almost give you a chill, they're so cool.'' Jim Krantz's work will be on display at Colette from Jan. 4 to 30."

2009-12-27T00:00:00Z,"The year started with the promise of a bang: on Jan. 12, NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft launched from Cape Canaveral aboard a Delta 2 rocket, beginning its six-month journey to reach the comet with which it would ultimately collide. Four days later, at the age of 66, Adriana Iliescu became the oldest woman known to give birth. The record has since been broken multiple times, most recently by 70-year-old Omkari Panwar, who, desperate for a male heir, defied the accepted limits of nature twice within a matter of minutes. (One of the twins was a boy.) Her response to the distinction: ''If I am the world's oldest mother it means nothing to me. I just want to see my new babies and care for them while I am still able.'' Two and a half weeks after Ms. Iliescu's delivery, the cancellation of ''Star Trek: Enterprise'' was announced, bringing to an end 18 consecutive years of ''Star Trek'' on television. Two days later, it was confirmed that asteroid 2004 MN4, once considered an impact risk, will safely pass Earth in 2029, but close enough to be visible to the naked eye. Two days after that, Jerrick De Leon became the smallest infant to survive open-heart surgery. Born more than three months premature, his chest was the length of the doctor's finger; the heart itself was the size of a small grape. Two days later, the Israelis and the Palestinian Authority agreed to a cease-fire, and a week after that, the National Hockey League canceled its entire season due to a labor dispute. And then Britain began monitoring its ban on sports that kill wild mammals."

It is likely that the rookie right tackle William Beatty will play for the Giants in place of Kareem McKenzie, who missed last Monday's game in Washington with a knee injury, and that the reserve Kevin Boothe will play again in place of left guard Rich Seubert, who has a knee injury. Quarterback Eli Manning and his passing attack have been the highlight of an uneven season, but pressure from Peppers -- against left tackle David Diehl or anywhere else on the line -- could disrupt the Giants' playoff plans.

Demolished in 1987, replaced by a park with some unfortunate phallic fountains. The Astrodome? A desolate hulk, even if it was once considered (by Houstonians) the Eighth Wonder of the World. And now, at decade's end, there is the vanishing Enron scandal. The company's twin towers were long ago leased to more modest businesses; Enron Field became Minute Maid Park; and unless you lost a fortune, got sued or indicted or served time -- or were related to someone who was or did -- the shame of Enron's collapse is long gone. Ask most locals about it and you get a hard blink followed by a blank stare: ''We're onto Annise now,'' someone close to Ken Lay, the former Enron chief executive, told me the other night, talking about our new mayor, Annise Parker, who's getting lots of good national press, mostly for being gay."

2009-12-27T00:00:00Z,"In ''Dirty Harry,'' the 1971 movie starring Clint Eastwood, the title character, a San Francisco police detective, ground his foot in the open wound of a serial killer to extract information on the whereabouts of a teenage girl he had buried alive. The movie made no bones that Harry's conduct violated the killer's constitutional rights, but neither Harry -- nor viewers -- seemed to care much. Rights for bad guys were a pain, freely disregarded when need be. Smash cut now to April 2004, when Americans first heard of Abu Ghraib, the infamous central prison in Baghdad, where the American military confined alleged insurgents and people accused of crimes against coalition forces. The appalling photographs that emerged, showing American troops gloating over beaten or tortured figures, shocked Americans and revealed an intriguing cleavage in the national psyche. We may admire badge-toting vigilantes like Dirty Harry, but we recoil from inhumane treatment when it's employed as a matter of policy by our government."

I was looking for something short. I don't wear short -- I usually wear more '40s-length dresses. But I had to go to a work party in L.A. I hadn't been to L.A. in so long, and there were all these girls in sequin miniskirts and I thought, 'Am I allowed to wear that?' I'm still not sure. I bought a taller pair of these Rachel Comey boots last year and I haven't taken them off. So this year, I bought the shorter ones, in black, too. I'm not a high-heel girl. I've just never felt comfortable in them. I'm way more adventurous with my clothing than with my shoes."

2009-12-27T00:00:00Z,"In 2009's holiday season of unemployment and the burst spending bubble, I was gnawing the chew toy of my own financial worries -- minuscule compared to most, agonizing in my skull's confines -- as I drove to the hospital to visit an ailing priest, a duty I didn't have time for. Between teaching and promoting a book this fall, I'd graced more than 60 planes with my increasingly careworn presence. When I'd said goodbye to Father Kane back in November, I'd half-expected him to die during my travels. A stroke had paralyzed both legs and withered one hand. Our autumn visits had grown quiet. I'd sit while he dozed and the TV scrolled community service announcements. A stomach tube was feeding him, and his shallow breaths were interrupted by ragged coughs. Plus the melanoma twice taken off his scalp -- his skull was rivered with scars -- had grown back, encrusted black and big as a quarter."

Wall Street had yet to implode, so private parties and ''whale'' wine buyers -- customers who'd spend $150 on food and $10,000 on wine -- were still in loud, proud abundance. Celebrity chefs who'd made their reputations on the haute side moved to capture the middle ground as well, expanding into branded burger joints. As with haute couture, those who couldn't afford the full ride could now at least buy the T-shirt."

2009-12-27T00:00:00Z,"In the barren, featureless prairie of the American Football Conference playoff race, an 8-6 team stands out like a mountain. The Baltimore Ravens were determined to hang around .500 this season -- they were 3-3, then 4-4, then 5-5, then 6-6. But they were too good to stay there. A two-game winning streak nudged them above the conference's Even Stevens, and they now control their future. The Ravens are in position for the fifth seed in the playoffs, and a division title is still possible. The Ravens' meteoric rise to slightly above average has come with a cost. The team is running out of receivers and cornerbacks. Mark Clayton has missed two games with a lingering knee injury, and although the deep threat Demetrius Williams has played well in relief, the Ravens suited up just four wide receivers last week. The situation is more dire in the secondary, where the rookie Lardarius Webb tore his anterior cruciate ligament against the Bears last weekend. Webb reached the starting lineup when Fabian Washington was injured; now, the career kick returner Chris Carr may be forced to start. The depleted secondary is a major problem against the Pittsburgh Steelers (7-7), who passed for 503 yards last week against Green Bay. The Ravens cannot afford a shootout because they do not have enough ammunition. The Ravens are an interesting monadnock, but injuries will erode them back into the plains. 1 p.m. Line: Steelers by 2 1/2"

The go-go Nineties gave us the rise of Ian Schrager and Amanresorts and W and exotic fantasies like Rajvilas and Singita and Las Ventanas al Paraíso. The Aughties, on the other hand, were defined by the contraction of development after 9/11; the growth of Asian and Middle Eastern cities requiring high-rise hotels that broke new ground but were far from groundbreaking; and a real-estate boom that fueled an endless stream of dull, mixed-use compounds in which hotels played second-fiddle to luxury residences."

Started as a biannual trunk show by Megan Wilson, an art director, Ancient Industries is a succinctly curated collection of everyday objects that we take for granted -- like dustpans, nail brushes, and colanders -- and which, more often than not, are plastic, disposable, ugly and made in China. We tend to hide these things from view; Ancient Industries aims to change that.The American-born Wilson grew up in Europe in the 1970s. With her aesthetics-and-quality-obsessed mother in charge, the family bought only traditionally made, well-designed and modest clothing and home items. When Wilson moved back to the United States, her penchant for quality and tradition led her to continue the pilgrimages of her youth to the markets of Europe, where items made by the ""ancient industries,"" like Austrian enamelware makers and Menorcan cobblers, still existed. When requests for her continental finds outnumbered the bags she wanted to carry home, she started selling these wares to her friends, then friends of friends, through trunk shows. In August, three years after establishing her business, Wilson set up an e-commerce Web site, and now we can all buy the perfect hot water bottle or enameled milk pot. Yes, $40 might be a lot for a dustpan, but when was the last time your friends coveted your dustpan?"

With her devoted children, Barbara (Arthur Safran) and Norman (Marilyn), grandchildren and great-grandchildren, we mourn the loss of our extraordinary Aunt Rivie. One of only two women in her NYU Law School graduating class, and a war bride who waited at home with her baby while her beloved Harry obm served as a Chaplain in the United States Army during the Normandy Invasion, Aunt Rivie was a shining example of ""the greatest generation,"" who in character and practice expressed the best of old fashioned American values and modern Orthodox Jewish tradition. Aunt Rivie always lived in the present. Until her last days, she was wholeheartedly engaged in the cultural life and political and social issues of each new decade. Her numerous acts of chesed were quiet and discreet, but she was a fierce, outspoken opponent of anyone who challenged her cherished beliefs, causes, or children. Not quite five feet tall, she was sedately dressed, practical, unfailingly reliable, a petite paradox who, without notice, would break into song or launch into her rendition of an old dance routine, sighing, ""I always wanted to be Cyd Charisse."" Her home was always open to newcomers, friends, her many siblings-in-law and their progeny, a welcome harbor at any time, a haven in times of joy and sorrow. Aunt Rivie was our ""true North."" We have lost a stalwart, generous, loving, spirited guide. Her life was a blessing to all of us. Propp and Zwang family"

2009-12-29T00:00:00Z,"An art scholar says his studies have yielded the solution to one of culture’s greatest mysteries: Why did Vincent van Gogh cut off part of his ear? Martin Bailey, an author, curator and van Gogh scholar, said that van Gogh inflicted the injury on himself in December 1888 after learning that his brother, Theo, was about to get married, The Times of London reported. In an article in the January issue of The Art Newspaper, Mr. Bailey wrote that he had devised the theory after studying van Gogh’s painting “Still Life: Drawing Board With Onions,” which the artist completed a month after cutting off part of his left earlobe. Among the details in the painting is an envelope, an image that Mr. Bailey examined under a microscope and said contained a letter in which Theo revealed he had proposed to his longtime girlfriend. “Vincent was fearful that he might lose his brother’s emotional and financial support,” leading to his self-mutilation, Mr. Bailey wrote. Historically, van Gogh’s ear cutting has been attributed to everything from his mental illness to his lead paints to a fight with his fellow painter Paul Gauguin."

2009-12-29T00:00:00Z,"In the mood for rematches? If the Jets beat the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday night, the Jets will be the fifth seed and will almost certainly face the Bengals in the wild-card round the next weekend. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, a loss by the Bengals would most likely make them the fourth seed even if the New England Patriots lose Sunday to Houston. That would leave the Patriots and the Bengals tied at 10-6, but New England holds a comfortable lead in the strength-of-victory tie breaker. There is only a very small chance the Bengals could overtake the Patriots in strength of victory. The Philadelphia Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys could also play in the wild-card round. If Dallas beats Philadelphia on Sunday, and the Green Bay Packers win at Arizona, the Eagles will be the sixth seed. If that happens and the Minnesota Vikings, who lost to Chicago on Monday night, win their final game and the Cardinals lose to Green Bay, the Cowboys will be the third seed and will play the Eagles."

Percy approached Jack and Lew Rudin for sponsorship in 1976, on the occasion of the country's bicentennial celebration, with the idea of growing what was then a Manhattan race to include all five boroughs. Thanks to Percy Sutton, the New York City Marathon became a showcase of the richness of this city's cultures and the diversity of its people, and an unforgettable experience of New York by tens of thousands of grateful runners. They are among the millions of people whose lives have been touched by Percy Sutton. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Leatrice, and his family. Jack Rudin and the Rudin family"

I sucked in my breath, signed the receipt and returned to my desk piled high with charts, messages, lab results and forms. I was being sued for medical malpractice. That was how it started. Eventually I peeked at the text of the complaint, which was riddled with accusations. Apparently, my conduct was ''malicious, willful, wanton or reckless,'' and I had ''negligently, carelessly and without regard'' for my patient's health treated her in such a manner that she had died the previous year."

NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' broadcast placed at the top of most viewers' list of favorite things, according to Nielsen's estimates, well ahead of a holiday-timed showing of ''The Sound of Music'' on ABC. Although final ratings for ''Sunday Night Football'' were not immediately available, the overnight estimates from the major media markets for the game were just slightly lower than last week's, which earned 18.2 million viewers. CBS ranked second for the night, benefiting from an overrun of its afternoon football coverage, and ABC finished third, drawing 6.4 million viewers for ''The Sound of Music.''

The dispute started back in 1993 when the European Union set quotas favoring banana imports from Ivory Coast, the Windward Islands and other former colonies at the expense of imports from Latin America. American banana companies and the Latin American countries where they grow their bananas sued the E.U., accusing it of rigging an unfair trade deal, first under the GATT and then under the W.T.O. The suit dragged on for years, and at several points threatened to spark an all-out trade war between Washington and Europe. In 1999, after a meeting on Kosovo was hijacked by the banana crisis, the secretary of state then, Madeleine Albright, declared in exasperation: ''I never in my life thought I would spend so much time on bananas.''"

The Fed would create the equivalent of a certificate of deposit that pays interest to banks for keeping some of their reserves -- which are currently estimated at more than $1 trillion -- for up to one year. That would help offset some of the $2.2 trillion the central bank has fanned out into the economy during the financial crisis.

Over the last half-century Mr. Wiley, 72, has been producing zany paintings, drawings and assemblages that look as if they been created by a dope-addled survivor of the California counterculture. One of the founding fathers of West Coast Funk art, along with figures like Robert Arneson, Roy Robert Hudson and Roy DeForest among others, Mr. Wiley rose to national prominence in the 1970s, when offbeat craft, storytelling and personal symbolism were all the rage. In the '80s his woolly shtick lost traction in the high-art world and lapsed into regional purgatory."

The attack, the third against Shiites in three days, appeared to deeply unsettle the Pakistani government, which ordered the director general of the Rangers, a paramilitary force under the control of the Interior Ministry, to take control of Karachi."

But in the three days since the attempted terrorist attack on a Detroit-bound airliner, the beleaguered traveler has once again been beset by a confusing and inconsistent set of rules. Could you keep your blanket, as on Continental, or would it be snatched at the end of the flight, as it was on Lufthansa? Would security measures be visibly unchanged, as they were at the Houston airport, or would passengers be surprised by a careful swabbing of their hands and purses, like those in South Carolina? Would this week resemble Sunday, when JetBlue's entertainment system was shut down on international flights, or Monday, when the movies began flowing on that airline once more?"

Caldwell learned at the feet of the master about how to set a goal and then stick to it, despite the protestations coming from his own locker room. After the Colts pulled their starters Sunday and quickly unraveled, the frustration of Caldwell's players was obvious. Peyton Manning stood with his arms crossed and helmet on, and in the locker room Reggie Wayne came as close as any Colts player to publicly criticizing his bosses.

Just west of downtown, the Lower West Side was historically a blue-collar Italian neighborhood, but in recent decades, Puerto Ricans and other Hispanics settled into the community. In recent years, the area has become home to resettled refugees from Myanmar, Somalia and other countries beset by conflict. To the west is Lake Erie, and to the northwest, the Peace Bridge linking western New York with Ontario.

''I've been loving having fun, coming into your living rooms, bedrooms, hair salons for the past five years.'' After its debut in 2005 ''The Tyra Banks Show'' quickly built a following on the strength of Ms. Banks's celebrity as a supermodel and reality TV star, her prolific use of the word fierce and her willingness to take on potentially divisive subjects. In November of that year she made headlines for a segment in which she donned a fat suit to look as if she weighed 350 pounds to demonstrate how she was treated differently by strangers. The show won Daytime Emmy Awards in the outstanding talk show (informative) category in 2008 and 2009.

Russia is home to a huge Georgian diaspora, and charter planes used to travel between the capitals three times a day during the holiday season. The flights were suspended in 2006 in retaliation for Georgia's arrests of four Russian military officers on espionage charges. The flights resumed in March 2008, but stopped again five months later, when the two countries went to war over the breakaway enclave of South Ossetia."

2009-12-29T00:00:00Z,"An art scholar says his studies have yielded the solution to one of culture's greatest mysteries: Why did Vincent van Gogh cut off part of his ear? Martin Bailey, an author, curator and van Gogh scholar, said that van Gogh inflicted the injury on himself in December 1888 after learning that his brother, Theo, was about to get married, The Times of London reported. In an article in the January issue of The Art Newspaper, Mr. Bailey wrote that he had devised the theory after studying van Gogh's painting ''Still Life: Drawing Board With Onions,'' which the artist completed a month after cutting off part of his left earlobe. Among the details in the painting is an envelope, an image that Mr. Bailey examined under a microscope and said contained a letter in which Theo revealed he had proposed to his longtime girlfriend. ''Vincent was fearful that he might lose his brother's emotional and financial support,'' leading to his self-mutilation, Mr. Bailey wrote. Historically, van Gogh's ear cutting has been attributed to everything from his mental illness to his lead paints to a fight with his fellow painter Paul Gauguin."

2009-12-30T22:00:51Z,"Broadway is once again having a tough winter: the critically acclaimed revival of the musical ""Finian's Rainbow"" will close on Jan. 17 after 22 preview and 92 regular performances. In a statement on Wednesday the producers blamed ""the economic realities of Broadway today"" for the quick end. A spokesman said the lead producers were unavailable for an interview about whether the show amounted to a total loss for investors. In recent weeks productions of the musicals ""Burn the Floor,"" ""Bye Bye Birdie,"" ""Ragtime"" and ""Shrek"" and the plays ""Oleanna"" and ""Superior Donuts"" closed or announced the end of their Broadway runs because of weak or unpredictable ticket sales. A pair of productions, ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"" and ""Broadway Bound,"" were also quickly canceled in late October because of poor sales. These financial disappointments come as Broadway's overall box office has been strong this season, thanks to star-driven shows (""A Steady Rain"") and blockbusters like ""Wicked."" Some shows close virtually every January, the start of a post-holiday slowdown, but the 2009-10 failed crop is fairly large. Other shows also closing soon, like ""Wishful Drinking,"" were scheduled as limited engagements."

2009-12-30T14:52:39Z,"A forgotten Robert Frost manuscript recently turned up in the basement of a Masonic lodge in Methuen, Mass. It's not a poem or an essay, but rather an attendance book Frost kept while teaching eighth grade in Methuen's Second Grammar School in 1893. City officials say the book is somewhat the worse for wear, according to The Boston Globe, and they're applying for a $3,000 grant to restore and rebind it. The entries are apparently all in Frost's hand as he painstakingly ticked off, day by day, who showed up and who didn't. At the time Frost himself was only 17, or just a few years older than his pupils, and a recent dropout from Dartmouth College, where he hadn't even finished his first semester. But teachers didn't need credentials in those days, and besides, Frost had pull: his mother also taught at Second Grammar. In fact, teaching was the Frost family business. Frost's father was a teacher and a journalist, and after his death Frost's mother, also a teacher, supported the family by returning to the classroom. She even opened her own private school in Salem, N.H., and not surprisingly her son, who was already writing and publishing poetry but needed a day job, got hired there, too."

Though ""Nine"" was showing on about 1,400 screens last weekend, it grossed just $5.5 million and will play on about 800 to 900 screens in the weeks ahead. ""The movie is performing very well on about 890 key screens,"" David Glasser, an operations executive for the Weinstein Company, told Reuters. In a review of ""Nine"" in The New York Times, A. O.

On Monday, it was announced that Mr. Zaks, a Tony Award winner whose credits include Broadway revivals of “Guys and Dolls” (in 1992) and “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,” had joined “The Addams Family” as creative consultant, leaving “All About Me” without a director for about a nanosecond. On Tuesday, press representatives for that show said that Casey Nicholaw, who directed and choreographed “The Drowsy Chaperone,” would take over as director of “All About Me.” “All About Me” is scheduled to begin previews at Henry Miller’s Theater on Feb. 19, with an official opening scheduled for March 18."

In The Chicago Tribune, Chris Jones wrote that “Banana Shpeel” was “cold, chaotic, clipped and cacophonous,” and in The Chicago Sun-Times, Hedy Weiss wrote that it could give “a bad name” to “all that was delicious about the classic variety show format of days gone by.” The publicists for “Banana Shpeel,” which is written and directed by David Shiner, said that anyone who bought tickets to a canceled preview of the show would be offered tickets for another performance. An opening night at the Beacon has not been announced."

2009-12-30T00:00:00Z,"A big Salvador Dalí work that has not seen the light of day for a long time emerged from deep storage on Monday at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. It's not a painting; the work is a huge stage curtain created by Dalí for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and given to the museum in 1976. It's also not officially on display; it was unrolled only for photographing it, determining its condition and helping the museum figure out how and where it might be presented permanently to the public. But those facts did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of the curators and conservators who got a chance to see the work -- 26 1/2 feet high and 49 1/2 feet wide -- laid out flat on the floor of the museum's Hall of Sculpture. ''It's spectacular,'' Louise Lippincott, the Carnegie's chief curator, told The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, adding that it appears to be in extremely good shape for its age. The canvas curtain, signed by Dalí's wife, Gala, who assisted him with projects, was made for a 1942 Ballet Russe touring production of ''Labyrinth,'' based on the myth of Theseus, and shows the knife-wielding hero battling the Minotaur (a detail is above). Wherever it is finally displayed, one thing is for certain: it will need some breathing room. ''You have to be able to stand back from it,'' Dr. Lippincott said."

Ginny was a woman of great style, intellectual curiosity and limitless laughter. She truly loved life, family and her many interests. Ginny was the consummate--and constant--hostess. She was a fabulous, creative cook whose generous hospitality will always be remembered by her many friends. Ginny traveled all over the world with her husband--each trip delighting her more than the last. At home, she was an avid reader and was actively involved in doing good for others. She helped launch the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center and serving as a Gala Chair for Family Counseling Services. Ginny's sense of humor, positive spirit and sense of humanity were an inspiration for all who knew her. Her family and her friends were her life. She made us laugh and taught us that being selfless was the key to true happiness.

They weren't your run-of-the mill flags, either. Kelly Washington's hold negated a Willis McGahee touchdown. Terrell Suggs's block in the back wiped out a Domonique Foxworth score. Frank Walker's illegal contact overrode Tom Zbikowski's potentially crucial fourth-quarter interception.

Tennessee has a new coach, a new swagger and, after a one-year absence, enough wins to reach bowl play.

However, CGI is used in this instance only because of both the running time of the commercial and the distance the entire ad would need to reach its conclusion; the ad agency, Wieden & Kennedy, couldn't find a studio large enough to accommodate the length of the ad, so the same space was used twice.

The original announcement said the child was born to Mr. Morrison and Gigi Lee, who was identified as his wife and manager.

A lack of consistency on offense (a group that sorely missed Sam Bradford, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, and tight end Jermaine Gresham) was equally damaging. Stanford did not lack for consistency or confidence with its offense, a unit led by the Heisman Trophy finalist Toby Gerhart and a shockingly mature redshirt freshman quarterback, Andrew Luck.

But according to the Paris daily Le Monde, museum administrators and the French Senate, which controls the museum building, have quarreled, and the Senate has decided to reassert its control.

2010-01-01T11:00:51Z,"UTICA, N.Y. -- The demolition in 1963 of New York City's Pennsylvania Station, a soaring masterpiece designed by McKim, Mead & White, gave way to the haphazard jumble of subway and train lines that grimly greet visitors today.

For Ohio State, this game presents another shot at redemption. The Buckeyes have become a punchline for bowl season incompetence because of their three consecutive B.C.S. setbacks, including losses to Florida and L.S.U. in consecutive national championship games. For Oregon, the Rose Bowl can serve as another high note in a year to remember. Before we forget, these Ducks experienced what looked to be a monumental defeat in the season opener against Bose State; I can admit I thought Oregon would not recover from that 19-8 loss. Recover it did, and its enters this game with a very good chance at winning the program's first Rose Bowl since 1917."

2010-01-01T02:00:59Z,"You owe it to Bobby Bowden, the departing Florida State coach, to watch this game. If you're not a West Virginia fan, you owe it to Bowden to root for the Seminoles. This is especially true if you're upset about the manner in which the university severed its relationship with the legendary coach, who is responsible for making the program into the power it was for decades and the team it is today. Unfortunately, what it is today is an average team, an unfitting end for a coach who certainly ranks among the best in the history of the sport. The 34-year F.S.U. coach has seemingly come full circle; he began his major college coaching career at West Virginia, and is hoping to avoid his first losing season since 1976, his first year in Tallahassee."

2010-01-01T01:00:11Z,"For the second time today, the Southeastern Conference will meet the Big Ten. The competition between the two power conferences has been relatively lopsided in recent years, most notably in the national championship game. The general feeling is that teams from the Big Ten lack the team speed to stay with teams from the SEC. To be honest, it's difficult to argue with that stance. In terms of this matchup, Penn State can take solace in the fact that it is simply more consistent on offense, a side of the ball that has given L.S.U. fits over the past two seasons."

But it is also in contention for a more dubious award: worst timing for the launch of a high-end tourist-and-advertising venture. In 2007, the Bay Area seemed ideal for all three of the company's planned revenue streams, from fees for scientific research to its $495-per-head tickets.

2010-01-01T00:15:33Z,"Despite hiring a young coach with an underwhelming resume, Auburn has spent the majority of this season in the shadow of Tennessee and its rookie coach, Lane Kiffin. This has been a luxury at times -- especially when you lose five of your last six against F.B.S. competition -- and unfortunate at others, such as during a 5-0 start. Northwestern, which actually lost to Syracuse, can commiserate with Auburn's up-and-down play. However, unlike Auburn, Northwestern played its best football in the final month, ending the year with wins over Iowa and Wisconsin."

As young purists might demand, this dance-theater adaptation includes a delicate heroine, a handsome prince and an evil queen who frequently intones, ''Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?''

Critics and reporters for The New York Times have peered deeply into January and found cultural offerings that say encouraging things about the year ahead. A new production of Bizet's ''Carmen'' can be seen in repertory at the Metropolitan Opera this month, and Pierre Boulez comes to Carnegie Hall to pick up the baton, not once but twice in January. Almost all the known drawings of the Mannerist master Bronzino go on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Jan. 20, the museum's first exhibition devoted to him. A new Anne Tyler novel arrives in bookstores, along with a biography of Warren Beatty and a much anticipated follow-up to the best seller ''Eat, Pray, Love,'' by Elizabeth Gilbert.

Did I say forgettable? For some of you, perhaps; I'll be trying out the old picture-in-picture feature in order to catch what could be a very competitive game, one that stars two teams with contrasting strengths and weaknesses. The Huskies can score (21st nationally with 32.1 points per game) -- the Gamecocks, yet again, cannot (96th). While South Carolina's defense ranks in the top 25 in the nation, Connecticut's is reliably mediocre. Each team is riding its own sort of momentum: South Carolina is coming off a win over rival Clemson, while Connecticut has weathered the emotions of the passing of one of its teammates and takes a three-game win streak into bowl play."

However, whatever points the Cowboys have lost on offense has been made up for by a shockingly aggressive, opportunistic defense. Yes, you read that right: Oklahoma State can play some defense. O.S.U. will be tested by the Rebels, whose team speed rivals anything the Cowboys have seen this season."

If it's bowl season, we all know where to find South Florida: in a tailspin. Yet again, the Bulls have folded in the second half of the season; after starting 5-0 this fall, U.S.F. has dropped five of seven. This is officially a trend. For Northern Illinois, 2009 served as proof that last season's bowl trip -- which came on the heels of a 2-10 finish in 2007 -- was not a fluke. The Huskies have already made a one-win improvement over last season and have a shot at winning eight games for the first time since 2004."

The initial announcement on his Web site (vanmorrison.com) said that he was the proud father of a new son, George Ivan Morrison III. It added that the baby was “the spitting image of his daddy” and a dual citizen of Britain and the United States. On Thursday a statement issued on Mr. Morrison’s behalf by the public relations company Fleishman-Hillard International said that the reports were “completely and utterly without foundation,” and that he had asked his management “to carry out an immediate investigation into a hacking attack which took place on my Web site on Dec. 29th last.” The first announcement said the child was born to Mr. Morrison and Gigi Lee, who was identified as his wife and manager. But an executive at Fleishman-Hillard, John Saunders, said in an interview with the Irish state radio network that Mr. Morrison had told him that the story was “completely false,” and that he had not heard of Gigi Lee. Mr. Morrison’s statement added, “For the avoidance of all doubt and in the interests of clarity, I am very happily married to Michelle Morrison, with whom I have two wonderful children.”."

When you watch the two passes, Montana to Clark and Eli Manning to David Tyree, in sequence and realize that the former was in a divisional playoff and the latter in the Super Bowl against an undefeated team, you must come to the conclusion that Manning to Tyree is rightfully ''The Catch.''

The star atop the tree at Rockefeller Center reflected this notion, as did a window at Bergdorf Goodman: a pianist in a gray wolf's head, a singer in a sparkly gray dress and a monkey playing a silver-coated bass. At Linda Horn Antiques at Madison Avenue and 93rd Street, white bears frolicked in silver tiaras. A woman in a gray and silver knit skirt drew an immediate reaction from a monkey, who leaped at a chance introduction. An entanglement ensued. Stylish women could also be found in pearly gray knitted sweaters. One wore a bag-shaped hat with a gray-silver star. Others donned silver leggings, down coats, shoes or boots."

The aides worked for Kenneth Feinberg, the government's special master for executive compensation, and they were awaiting submissions from companies that had received (and not yet paid back) billions in what federal regulations call ''exceptional assistance'' from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. The government had the authority to set compensation levels at those seven TARP recipients, and this was the companies' opportunity to plead for salaries and bonuses for each of its top 25 executives. Chrysler Financial and General Motors submitted their proposals -- about 2,000-plus pages each -- a few days before.

2010-01-03T00:00:00Z,"Social networking is responsible for the dumbing-down of American trash talk. Chad Ochocinco used this week's matchup with the All-Pro cornerback Darrelle Revis as reason to compose a Twitter ''Song of Myself,'' but Ochocinco's barbaric yawp lacked its usual flair. ''I'm coming to the big apple to give NY what they've never seen, an escape inmate gone wild on Revis Island'' is well composed, but it doesn't resonate like an end-zone ''Riverdance.'' Ochocinco contains multitudes, so even he was moved to compliment Revis. ''Technique is awesome -- good patience at the line'' was among the few printable scouting reports. Revis was mostly silent, as one who can't get a word in edgewise often is. The Revis-Ochocinco battle will end in a stalemate, turning the Bengals' passing game into a series of 5-yard dump-offs to Brian Leonard. The Jets' passing game (what's left of it) will be shut down by Leon Hall, Johnathan Joseph and the solid Bengals secondary. That leaves both teams trying to run against great run defenses. The Bengals and the Jets use more formations with six offensive linemen than other teams, so don't expect a lot of finesse. It's a good thing Giants Stadium is closing, because with two teams running up the middle behind wide-load offensive fronts, the playing surface may be permanently warped after Sunday night."

Ginny was the loving, caring, best friend, cheerful, kind and wonderful wife of Stephen Blacker. She was also the best mom, mentor and confidante of sons Peter Blacker (Luis Gonzalez) and Andrew Blacker (Elizabeth Sarachek Blacker). She was the adoring grandmother of Braden Storm Blacker, whom he fondly called ""Gigi"". Ginny was devoted to her sisters (""the Kelly Girls"") and brothers-in-law: Susie and Bill Untereker and Meg and Kenny Rehders. She was also the loving and caring aunt of seven nephews and nieces. Ginny was a woman of great style, intellectual curiosity and limitless laughter. She truly loved life, family and her many interests. Ginny was the consummate--and constant--hostess. She was a fabulous, creative cook whose generous hospitality will always be remembered by her many friends. Ginny traveled all over the world with her husband--each trip delighting her more than the last. At home, she was an avid reader and was actively involved in doing good for others. She helped launch the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center and serving as a Gala Chair for Family Counseling Services. Ginny's sense of humor, positive spirit and sense of humanity were an inspiration for all who knew her. Her family and her friends were her life. She made us laugh and taught us that being selfless was the key to true happiness.

2010-01-03T00:00:00Z,"OWEN--Melvin M.,D.D.S., dentist, inventor, writer, artist passed away quietly on Wednesday, December 23, 2009, in Georgetown, Texas. He was an outstanding dental practitioner in New York City and Ft. Myers, Florida. Mel learned the importance of painless dentistry from his father and excelled at treating complex and difficult cases. In his efforts to always explore new techniques, he invented a diamond tool that substantially lessened the time preparing teeth for crowns and bridges. Mel's creative genius played out in many other avenues. He wrote stage scripts for numerous musical shows, designed furniture and fixtures, created amazing mobiles, sculptures and metal works, and crafted pottery, where he developed unique glazing techniques. He was among the first to help the blind study textbooks through audio tapes by establishing groups of volunteers to record them. Mel designed ""flip books"" to help teach activities such as a golf swing and developed a forerunner of today's more advanced golf simulators. Mel was dedicated to the spirit and mission of Rotary International, having been a member at clubs in Ft. Myers and Sun City for many years. He was active in a variety of groups at Sun City Georgetown, including the Sun City Theater Group, the Computer Club, the Solos Club, and the Creative Crafts and Clay Club. Over his lifetime, Mel was active as a tennis player, golfer, snow skier, sailor, boatman, windsurfer, bocce player, and bridge player. He loved to dance with his beautiful wife, Moana Holt Owen. Mel's zest for life encompassed many disciplines. His elegance and refinement lent an air of grace to every event. He could regale partygoers with tales of worldwide travels while charming his partners on the dance floor. Mel was always a gentleman without ceasing to be a gentle man, one whose kindness will be fondly remembered. The true testament to Mel is the warmth and love which he inspired in the hearts of the many fortunate enough to have known him throughout his rich and rewarding life. Mel was born in Brooklyn, NY, on August 13, 1923. After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School, Long Island University, and NYU Dental School, Mel served as an Army dentist in Alaska from 1946-47. He moved with Moana to Cape Coral, Florida, in 1975. After she passed on, he relocated to Sun City Georgetown in 1996. He leaves behind a lifetime treasure of loving memories for his son Mallard Owen and wife Judith Smith of Ashburn, Virginia; his daughter Meredith Owen of Round Rock, Texas; his sister, Alese Owen Pechter; his brother and sister-in-law, Edwin and Nancy Owen; and his nephews, John and Andrew Owen; and Stuart, Richard, Jay and Todd Pechter."

2010-01-03T00:00:00Z,"The faltering economy provided the United States with at least one silver lining: a narrowing of the trade gap. In 2006, that gap had grown so large that Warren Buffett warned it was a bigger threat to the domestic economy than either the federal budget deficit or consumer debt. The bursting of the housing bubble and the ensuing credit crisis caused consumer spending to drop abruptly, and imports plunged as a result. Exports fell as well, but not as sharply, so the trade gap shrank from $65 billion in May 2006 to $26 billion in May 2009. But as economists have noted, when the economy began to recover last fall, the trade deficit began to rise again as consumers felt freer to spend money on flat-screen TV's and other luxury items, many of which come from China. Last month, President Obama cautioned that the lopsided trade relationship with China could put enormous economic and political strain on the two countries."

2010-01-04T00:00:00Z,"Before the Ravens lost to the Patriots on Oct. 4, their offense was being hailed as nearly the explosive equal of the Patriots', which to that point had struggled. The game was close -- a 27-21 Patriots victory -- but it sent Baltimore into a tailspin, largely because of its defense. The Ravens lost three in a row. Their offense has not been the same since, either, scoring big only against leaky defenses like the Lions' and the Bears'. No matter their record, is there any team that makes opponents more nervous in January than the Patriots? New England had looked to be rounding into playoff form, but losing receiver Wes Welker to a season-ending knee injury is devastating. The Ravens can focus on stopping Randy Moss. The Patriots have had problems with their secondary, and the pass rush has been less than effective against elite quarterbacks. If the Patriots can get a lead, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco will be on the run. Still, this is not the Patriots' best team by a long shot, and even if they get past the Ravens, Indianapolis and San Diego could scorch the secondary."

2010-01-04T00:00:00Z,"The old saying in the N.F.L. is that it's hard to beat a team three times in one season. Well, maybe not. The Steelers did it to the Ravens last year, after all, and after Sunday's domination of the Eagles to win the division, the Cowboys seem primed to do it this season. Despite Dallas's three-game winning streak to end the regular season, the December doubts will not be put to rest unless the Cowboys win this game. Given how they overwhelmed the Eagles on both sides of the ball Sunday -- there was a noticeable lack of energy and execution by Philadelphia -- the question is how quickly the Eagles can correct that. One big thing they should begin with is to bring pressure on Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo from the start, not simply drop into coverage. That may not be possible if the Dallas offensive line, one of the best in the N.F.L., plays the way it did Sunday in dominating the Eagles and opening huge holes for the running game. The Eagles had won six in a row before the regular-season finale, but the victory total comes with a daunting addendum: they did not beat a playoff team all season. Player to watch With DeSean Jackson, Philadelphia's offense has become centered on big plays, but quarterback Donovan McNabb had little timing against the Cowboys on Sunday."

In every capacity, in every role, whether it be family or community or business, he fulfilled it far beyond expectation. He served his country with honor, his principles with conviction, and his family with immeasurable love and devotion.
