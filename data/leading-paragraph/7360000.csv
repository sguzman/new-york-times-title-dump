2010-05-11T00:00:00Z,"May 9 We are all completely exhausted after two successful hikes to the summit of Mt. Marojejy, including night work there. And best of all, we found amazing chameleons, including two of the rarest species in the world!! It is now time to catch up with some sleep, then photograph the animals, and then start some of the lab work. Also, lots of other wonderful things here, including a super-sticky narrow-mouthed toad that you can pick up by touching your finger on its back. The weather has been kind to us -- no rain, although lots of clouds and mist above 2,000 m (summit at 2,132 m).But my sweat-laden T-shirt from the first day hike is still not dry at our mossy camp."

2010-05-11T00:00:00Z,"On March 20, the Plastiki, a 60-foot vessel made from recycled plastic bottles, set sail from San Francisco Bay on an 11,000-mile voyage to Sydney, Australia. The goal of the voyage, masterminded and financed by a banking heir, David de Rothschild, is to call attention to environmental issues like bottled water and plastic waste. Solar panels and windmills power the vessel, and the crew uses Skype, Twitter and blogs to stay in touch with the outside world. They've also posted regular video updates. After 38 continuous days at sea, the crew anchored at Christmas Island on April 27 for a few days' rest before the next leg, a 20- to 30-day voyage to Fiji. Before the boat sailed, we chatted by e-mail with Jo Royle, the Plastiki's 30-year-old skipper, about the challenges that the crew has faced. Here are excerpts, edited for brevity and clarity.Q.For starters, describe your whereabouts for our readers. Are you happy to be onshore after a month at sea?A.Right now I am on the beautiful tropical shores of Christmas Island, which is situated 1.5 degrees north of the equator. Moving very slowly, as it's very hot and I am having to acclimate to this tropical heat. I have to work on the boat as the sun rises, hide at lunchtime and then surface again before sunset. This is a very welcome rest.Q.Did you have any harrowing moments in those 38 days sailing the Pacific? Surprises?A.Thankfully, we experienced no head winds and no constant wind speed above 25 knots. If we had spent 38 days in the Atlantic, we would have seen so much more, and experienced more complex weather systems. It has taken this experience for me to really realize what an adventure we are on. I know the Pacific Ocean covers one-third of the planet, but wow, it felt massive out there. We were so alone!"

Exhausted from the two days of driving, we checked into the small Crystal Hotel at 8 in the morning, enjoyed a breakfast of eggs and French bread, and then presented our research permits to the local Madagascar National Parks office. The park director explained to us that there was no problem working in the Marojejy Park at night (which was a huge relief since many reserves have stopped this because of security concerns), and very quickly we were looking at maps, and making plans for guides, porters and camping fees. My priority on this survey was to work the highest elevation forests, close to the summit, as these forests had been the most poorly explored and had the potential to have the highest degree of local endemism (species restricted to Marojejy, or the local massifs). Of course, there is a good reason why the highest elevation areas have had the least amount of study - they are hardest to reach, and are the most difficult to resupply."

Matthew graduated from Woodmere Academy, Middlebury College and the Thunderbird School. Following service in the U.S. Army, he worked on a Chilean freighter, jumping ship in Peru. He stayed in Peru for several years, farming in the Ayacucho Valley, publishing in Lima and editing the poetry review, Haravec. Returning to New York City, in the early 1970s Matthew pursued his interests in startup ventures and local politics, and later in real estate and land preservation in the Hudson Valley. Known as a raconteur and for his infectious joie de vivre, Matthew will always be treasured for his sense of adventure, mastery of sailing and love of the sea, poetry and prose, but most of all his acts of generosity and kindness. Matthew is survived by his beloved wife Susan Mackenzie, sons Christopher and Timothy, nephews Andrew and Peter and niece Nancy, sister Judith, and a host of other loving in-laws, nieces and grand nieces and nephews, and friends.

That means trying to plan (and pack) for everything that can go wrong. And a lot can go wrong in Madagascar. For example, when the car breaks down and strands you in the middle of nowhere, with absolutely no roadside towing, except maybe a couple of zebu cows in the closest village, if you can find their owner. So, a very good place to start the practical preparation is with the car -- my trusty old Land Rover, ''Baby.'' She will be carrying us down 2,000 km of road and tracks to Marojejy mountain, so she is the most critical piece of research equipment. Baby has had a distinguished and adventurous life, which includes crossing the Betsiboka River (one of Madagascar's largest) in full flood, on top of three canoes, during the 2002 political crisis. Like a doting parent, I am always nervous, when she goes in for her checkups. Nicholas, my team driver, mechanic and car guard, told me the car had just been serviced after a trip with one of my students, but would benefit from an additional ''verification,'' just to make sure all was in good order."

2010-05-11T00:00:00Z,"We finally left Tana on May 2, fully loaded with all our equipment and supplies. The packing is always high stress, as the omission of a single item can have terrible consequences in the field, when resupply is not an option. For example, no formalin or alcohol (perhaps due to a leaking bottle top), or no spare flashlight bulbs, can bring research to a complete stop. I had hoped we could have departed the previous afternoon, but my driver, Nicholas, was nervous about nighttime attacks on vehicles between Tana and Antsohihy, so we left at first light. The drive went smoothly (except for the shaking from the unbalanced new tires above 80km/h!) and we crossed the Betsiboka River at midday, admiring the brown silt-laden rapids, which told us we were still at the end of the rainy season. Herpetologists love the rain, as it keeps the frogs and reptiles active, but the cost in the tropics is fungus growing in your optics and electronics, and the worst kind of slippery mud off-road. My dead dog count for our first day of driving reached three - it really is a dog's life in Madagascar. They are considered so unclean that they are left at the roadside to be scavenged by crows.

Vollmann and photographs by Danko Steiner, I rooted out my few copies of Nest. I hadn't thought about them in a while and wasn't surprised that their look and sense of freedom continued to inspire. A frustration voiced a lot these days - by art directors, writers, bloggers and others - is that people aren't actually creating new things today. They are repeating, mimicking, collecting, downloading, endlessly commenting upon - activities that may be interesting and that may reflect the present moment but  are not about creating anything. One could even argue that they are the opposite of creativity and produce the feeling of being in a prison. Of course, when you consider the very real problems that many people in the world face, like hunger and shortages of medicine, these sorts of complaints sound silly. But creativity in the arts and in applied arts like fashion obviously does matter, and the ways that people insist on being outside the prison are interesting. Perhaps that was the essence of my conversation with Joerg Koch, the editor of 032c, which is based in Berlin. Here are some excerpts:"

Checho Gonzáles, 44, the heavily tattooed chef at the year-old restaurant Ají (Rua Bela Cintra, 1709; 011-55-11-3083-4022; entrees $17 to $27), fuses the flavors of his native Bolivia with the classics of Brazilian cooking. (Each of his knuckles is inked with the image of a popular local bar snack.) The meat stew cozido, for example, is made with tender chunks of picanha braised in red wine, and the caipirinhas are flecked with bright red ají peppers from the mountains of his homeland. At Marakuthai, tucked away in a house in Jardins (above; Alameda Itu, 1618; 011-55-11-3062-7556; entrees $20 to $29), the 21-year-old Renata Vanzetto takes inspiration from Thai food for her cooking, which is based on fresh local fruit and produce, for dishes like shrimp in curry sauce with coconut-crusted banana. And at Kaá (Avenida Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek, 279; 011-55-11-3045-0043; entrees$22 to $37), a high-design Jardins hot spot, Paulo Barros uses Amazonian ingredients like star fruit and bacuri to localize his French-Italian menu.

Subban struggled to keep up with the masterly Crosby, but he did stay with him. Crosby reversed once more, back down through the corner, to the end boards. Subban was falling behind. Crosby planned to gain space to make a centering pass or step to the net and shoot. But Subban lunged and caught up -- no pass for Crosby, no path to the net. Crosby did another stutter-step. This time, he freed himself of Subban, but the puck rolled off the end of his stick. Crosby, seemingly exhausted, could not summon the energy to retrieve it. The Canadiens won the loose puck."

2010-05-12T00:00:00Z,"PRYSTOWSKY--Milton, MD passed away unexpectedly on May 10, 2010. Milt was born in Charleston, South Carolina on February 17, 1922. He was the beloved husband of the late Rose Prystowsky, MD. and is survived by his loving children, Doctors Stephen, Eric, Michael, Barry, and Richard, devoted daughters-in-law, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and brother, Sidney, MD. After training in pediatrics and pediatric cardiology at the Harriet Lane Home of Johns Hopkins University under the tutelage of Helen Taussig, Milt was the first pediatric cardiologist in New Jersey and opened the Division of Pediatric Cardiology at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. In his signature bow tie, he practiced as a pediatrician and pediatric cardiologist in Nutley, NJ from 1951 to 2004. Even in retirement, he continued to see patients as a consultant at Children's Hospital of New Jersey. His many years of service as a tireless healer of and advocate for children--especially those who are most vulnerable--as well as his longtime service on public health committees in New Jersey, led to improved health care and insurance benefits for children. In his more than 60 years of medical service, he had numerous accomplishments and received many awards. He was on the Founding Board of Children's Hospital (in Newark, NJ), for example. He served as President of the Public Health Council of New Jersey, which oversees the New Jersey State Department of Health. United Hospital of New Jersey recognized him with a special title, given only to him: ""Role Model for Pediatric Residents."" The New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry presented him with a Lifetime Dean's Award. He was also Clinical Professor of Pediatrics and Pediatric Cardiology at the medical schools. And, to take but one more example, he was with the national organization of all NACRI organizations (with Children's Hospital), representing New Jersey in Washington, DC, to lobby for much needed funds. Milt's seemingly indefatigable advocacy for children is perhaps best exemplified by his having led the years-long effort to establish New Jersey's Catastrophic Children's Illness Fund--a unique model in the nation, which ensures that no family in New Jersey ever has to go bankrupt because they have a child in desperate need of catastrophic medical care. This accomplishment underscores that, first and foremost, Milt was a model humanitarian, who cared about helping persons regardless of their ability to pay, and regardless of their social station in life. Indeed, what those who knew him say that they remember most about Milt was his genuine kindness, his warmth, his caring personality. No problem was ever too small to be brought to his attention, as the many persons whose lives he touched knew it. Dr. Milton Prystowsky influenced the lives of thousands of countless lives and made a significant impact on the quality of families and communities. He will be sorely missed. Funeral services will be held Wednesday, May 12, 10am at Congregation Kneses Tifereth Israel, 575 King St., Port Chester, NY. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in Dr. Prystowsky's honor should be made to the Drs.

2010-05-13T00:00:00Z,"When business owners visit our firm to discuss the sale of their businesses, they are often accompanied by another person. Typically that person is a spouse, lawyer, accountant, partner with an equity stake or family member who works in the business. But every so often the other person is introduced as ''a friend.'' At this point I hope for the best but prepare mentally for the worst. I sometimes refer to these people as an F.O.B. (friend of the business). More often than not, the F.O.B. and the owner were friends in another life -- high school, college, church or a stint with a previous employer. It usually takes a few probing questions to decipher the role of the F.O.B. in the organization."

The Board and Staff of the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved friend, colleague, and Board Vice President, Rhonda Copelon. Rhonda's key roles in the struggle for reproductive rights and justice against human rights abusers the world over made her a role model for legions of colleagues and students. She was a fierce advocate for women's rights and opened new opportunities in the international law arena for challenging violence and other gender-based abuses. In 1980, Rhonda was a central lawyer in two landmark cases, Harris v. McRae, which took a challenge to the Hyde amendment to the Supreme Court, and Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, which ruled that cases involving human rights abuses committed abroad could be brought in U.S. courts. We have lost an irreplaceable force and a very dear friend. A memorial service will be held at Riverside Chapel, 80 W. 76th Street, on May 21 at 11:45am.

2010-05-13T00:00:00Z,"I have been introduced to a woman named Marilyn Jones who owns Consolidated Printing in Chicago. She has been credited with being a pioneer in the ''green'' printing industry. As a matter of fact, Debra Jacobson of the Printer's National Environmental Assistance Center has called her the ''mother of the green printing movement.'' Like many things in business, Marilyn's pioneering came in part by accident. When she started her company in 1973, printing was one of the most toxic industries around. But she became friendly with a customer who owned a vitamin company and who espoused his belief that everything people touch and feel affects their health. Marilyn decided to try to replace the toxic chemicals in the printing process with common household products. There was a lot of trial and error and calling of vendors to ask them if they could try something other than benzene. Long before the green movement took off, this was the start of a 37-year quest to change the industry."

2010-05-13T00:00:00Z,"I went running with Scott Jurek on a clear, chilly morning last month, an easy four-mile loop in Central Park. He ran another few miles with 50 or so adoring fans, then another few by himself, for a total of about 15. After that he showered and came to my house to cook lunch before going for a late-afternoon jog of another 10 miles or so. That's an easy day for Jurek, 36, an accomplished ultramarathoner. But one might say he has been in a slump: he has not won a major race since the 2008 Spartathlon. On the other hand, he set a personal record there, it was his third consecutive victory on the 153-mile course between Athens and Sparta, and he holds the fifth-, sixth- and eighth-fastest times in race history."
2010-05-13T00:00:00Z,"Even though I've worked with hundreds of business owners over the years, I recently learned something about them that took me by surprise: for many, self-promotion is as uncomfortable as wearing their underwear backward. I never realized how common this reluctance is -- until I had a series of conversations. I recently met up with Renee Trudeau, a work-life balance coach and president of Career Strategists, based in Austin, Tex. Renee told me she believed that one of the main reasons businesses failed was that their owners didn't embrace marketing. Why don't they? There are several reasons, Renee believes: some are intimidated by marketing, some say it makes them feel false or insincere, others fear being visible."
2010-05-13T00:00:00Z,"Perhaps the most memorable image from the Times Square car-bomb attempt was those men in the bulky green suits who walked right up to the smoking, sparking Pathfinder on West 45th Street and peered into it to find an elaborate assemblage of explosives.''It is a lonely walk, going into a situation like that,'' said Sgt. Joseph Hourihan of the New York Police Department's Bomb Squad. ''You never really know if you're walking down to the last thing you'll ever do on earth.'' He added that while the bomb suit offered protection from smaller blasts, it would not save one's life -- no suit would -- standing next to your basic car bomb. As I found out on Tuesday, aside from the terror of dealing with a bomb, simply wearing the suit is a pretty taxing endeavor in itself."
2010-05-13T00:00:00Z,"FIVE or six years ago, men made a deal. In the name (and spirit) of dressing well (and up), they would embrace the soigné glamour of the tuxedo. Velvet and satin details, shawl and peak lapels: bring it on. But they would deep-six the entire lot of maddening tuxedo minutiae, which are as easy and festive to manage as a year's worth of tax receipts. Cummerbunds. Studs. Cuff links. Patent-leather slippers. Piqué bib-front shirts. Bow ties. Those were the terms -- the 2004 Oscars swarmed with handsome actors in tuxedos, white dress shirts and black four-in-hand neckties -- and they were crucial to the tuxedo's resurgence not only as a feature of dinner-dress events but also as a fashion influence in its own right. Stylish clothes began turning up with tux touches: a satin stripe on a pair of charcoal pants, a dinner sport coat made in black velvet, a pastel dress shirt with a pleated front."

Shuffling two by two, 36 strong, behind a choirboy on a black runway in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's cavernous Medieval Hall, they're like a troop of fairy-tale dwarfs turned to stone by an evil sorcerer. Unhappy campers, they weep, sigh, gesture sadly and pray, mourning the demise of their liege, John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy (1371-1419). They are a long way from home, and it will be a while before they can return. Lovingly carved from alabaster by Jean de la Huerta and Antoine Le Moiturier, they hail from the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Dijon, France. There they usually occupy niches in an extravagantly ornamental, Gothic arcade beneath the slab on which lies an effigy of the duke and his wife, Margaret of Bavaria. As the French museum is currently undergoing restoration, it was decided that the sorrowful gang of monks, clerics and sundry laymen would be liberated from the duke's tomb and sent on a journey around the United States. This is the first stop on the eight-city tour, and anyone who cares about the art of sculpture should pay them a visit, for each is a small masterpiece of stone carving and humanist realism."

(13) CARMEN The Latvian mezzo-soprano Elina Garanca, above, portrays Bizet's fiery Gypsy in this staging by the British director Richard Eyre, in his Metropolitan Opera debut, set in the 1930s to invoke the brutal repression surrounding the Spanish Civil War. Roberto Alagna is Don José, the soldier obsessed with Carmen; Barbara Frittoli is the good-hearted Micaëla, the emissary of Don José's mother; Teddy Tahu Rhodes, filling in for an ailing Mariusz Kwiecien, is the dashing toreador Escamillo; and Yannick Nézet-Séguin, also in his Met debut, conducts. Christopher Wheeldon choreographed the dances; Rob Howell designed the sets and costumes. Renée Fleming hosts this ''Great Performances at the Met'' presentation, taped on Jan. 16. Reviewing the production in The New York Times, Anthony Tommasini said that Ms. Garanca ''sings with rich sound, an unerring feel for the nuance and subtext of a phrase, and alluring sensuality.'' He added: ''But this is Mr. Eyre's triumph. In only his third opera, he knew what he wanted. I have never seen the final scene, in which the crazed Don José stabs the fatalistically defiant Carmen, executed with such stunning realism, a dangerous mingling of sex, rebellion and violence: the very essence of 'Carmen.'

Ms. Ricci will enter the cast of that Donald Marguliesplay, which centers on a photojournalist played by Laura Linney. Brian d'Arcy James and Eric Bogosian, who appeared with Ms. Linney when the play was presented this year by Manhattan Theater Club, will also rejoin the production when it resumes performances at a Shubert Theater to be determined. ''Time Stands Still'' is nominated for a Tony Award for best play, and Ms. Linney is nominated for best leading actress in a play. ... Elsewhere on Broadway the producers of David Mamet's ''Race'' said that when James Spaderleaves the play after June 20, he will be replaced by Eddie Izzard, above right. Mr. Izzard made his Broadway debut in the 2003 revival of ''A Day in the Death of Joe Egg,'' the Peter Nichols comedy. Dennis Haysbert (''24,'' ''The Unit'') will take over from David Alan Grier starting June 15, when Afton C. Williamson (''Joe Turner's Come and Gone'') will also replace Kerry Washington."

The theater and film designer Santo Loquasto created the costumes for the original ''Ragtime'' and for this season's revival, and several of the costumes in both productions bore similarities. Costume designs that ''substantially duplicate'' work from a prior production are not eligible for Tony Awards, according to the Tony rulebook, but no one involved with ''Ragtime'' or the Tony Awards made a determination about Mr. Loquasto's designs before they were announced on May 4 as among the four nominees for best costume design of a musical."
2010-05-14T00:00:00Z,"An obituary in some editions on Monday about the singer and actress Lena Horne included a number of errors. Nina Mae McKinney, not Ms. Horne, was the first black performer signed to a long-term contract by a major Hollywood studio. (Ms. McKinney signed a five-year contract with MGM in 1929, more than a decade before Ms. Horne joined the same studio.) Ms. Horne's son, Teddy, died in 1970, not 1971. And besides her daughter, Gail Lumet Buckley, Ms. Horne is survived by six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. At the time Ms. Horne was hired by the Cotton Club in Harlem, in 1933, Duke Ellington was no longer performing there. The 1951 movie version of the musical ''Show Boat'' -- in which Ms. Horne had wanted to be cast -- was the third film version, not the second.

2010-05-14T00:00:00Z,"The global war on AIDS has racked up enormous successes over the past decade, most notably by providing drugs for millions of infected people in developing countries who would be doomed without this life-prolonging treatment. Now the campaign is faltering. Donations from the United States and other wealthy countries have leveled off while the number of people infected with H.I.V., the AIDS virus, grows by a million a year. By one informed estimate, only $14 billion will be available of some $27 billion needed this year to fight the disease in the developing world. Fewer than 4 million of the 14 million people infected with the AIDS virus are getting drug treatment -- far short of the goal of universal access set by the United States and others."

They rested the banged-up Nick Swisher, and Derek Jeter, their leadoff hitter, is slumping, not that he would call it that. It was all a blueprint for trouble, and the outcome played true. The Yankees are the highest-scoring team in the majors, but they have not acted that way since setting foot inside Comerica Park. Their 6-0 defeat to the Tigers, the Yankees' second shutout loss in two days, capped a losing seven-game trip that accentuated the extremes of their offense. The Yankees scored 24 runs in their first two games in Boston, but strip away their six-run ninth-inning outburst in the second game of Wednesday's doubleheader, and they have scored six runs over their last 35 innings."

Son of the late David and Elizabeth Pearl and brother of Eugene Pearl who also predeceased him. Survived by his wife of 39 years, Erika, his sister-in-law Patricia Pearl, nephew Mark Pearl (Kathy) of Arlington, TX and niece Davina Pearl Tripp of Keller, Texas; by his grand-nephews and grand-nieces Stuart, Stacey, Caitlin and Brady and great-great-nephew Kane; cousins Eva, Anne and Elizabeth Foltin and Lottie, David and Robert Miklos. The cause of death was pulmonary failure and in keeping with his character Michael stubbornly fought his illness for a long time. His wife Erika and good friend Patrick Mullen were at his side when he closed his eyes for the last time. Michael attended Brentwood High School and Washington University in St. Louis and graduated from the University of Texas, Austin. He was a gifted, exceptionally smart, unique man with a great sense of humor. He made people laugh and his own laughter was exuberant. He was a complex man who could also be difficult and at times explosive but never dull. Among his many interests was a love of history, sports, building and restoring furniture, collecting old cast iron toys and old maps and prints which he framed himself. He also was a fine Friday night poker player. More than most anything Michael loved to work at his job. He was a Senior Vice President of Gould Paper Corporation where he celebrated his 50th anniversary in the spring of 2009. He was a dedicated, loyal, trusted employee and friend and in turn was much respected and appreciated by his colleagues who were also his friends. Special thanks to his ""bosses"" both current and past, Mr. Harry E. Gould Jr., Mr. Carl Matthews, Mr. Danny Lala and Mr. Peter J Gould, for their loyalty and generosity throughout Michael's career and extraordinary caring during his disability and illness. Peter and Michael started almost at the same time at Gould in 1959 and ever since their friendship endured. Michael and Gerry Malia, another long-time colleague and friend shared many coffees and chats in the early morning hours as the first arrivals at the office. Among his friends three are from Michael's youth in Texas, - Jan Buckaloo, Mel Pekarsky and Audrey Brians. Very special thanks to Jan and Sloane Shelton, another long-time friend, for bringing Michael and Erika together all those years ago. Michael's family and all his friends loved and admired him and feel fortunate to have shared their lives with him. Much appreciation to Michael's physicians and caregivers who were so dedicated to him. Special thanks to Dr. Joseph Lowy, Michael's pulmonary doctor and Dr. Hillel Tobias, his physician for 35 years. Burial was private. Contributions in Michael's memory may be made to NYU Langone Medical Center, c/o Development Office, 1 Park Avenue, 17th floor, New York, NY 10016 or to a charity of your choice."

He is best known as ""Mr. Chipwich"", the inventor of the original Chipwich, the ice cream cookie sandwich, of which he was so proud, and which came from a love of dunking cookies in milk. He worked hard his whole life, attending the prestigious Brooklyn Tech High School, and Brooklyn College and New York Law School at night over many years while working jobs at AT&T and CBS. Chipwich Chippoppity, a cookie candy, came out of the Chipwich brand and at its second release functioned in conjunction with MyStudentBiz, a business which allowed students to earn money, scholarships, and own a part of the company. His goal was to pass on the entrepreneurship skills he had learned, by mentoring students and helping anyone who asked for his advice. He loved helping people in any way he could, notorious for giving a helping hand to the homeless, and teaching his children to do the same. His generosity was outstanding, and a large part of his life. He created companies that would help people, like his current company, The MD System, an all-natural pain relief system, which will continue on. He loved reading and music, talking sports, car rides, having dinners with his older daughter, watching his younger daughter play sports, always an incredibly devoted family man.

2010-05-16T00:00:00Z,"It's not easy to choose a single moment of chemical connection from Twyla Tharp's swinging celebration of Frank Sinatra's music, ''Come Fly Away.'' Ms. Tharp uses a dance vocabulary mixing ballroom and ballet to explore so many facets of the man-woman thing that to select a single pas de deux seems almost arbitrary. Still, for sheer sizzle nothing beats the tempestuous duel performed by Karine Plantadit and Keith Roberts, above, to Sinatra's recording of ''That's Life,'' a defiant anthem about soldiering on in the face of adversity. That erotic attraction can be a fierce adversary is illustrated with electrifying aplomb by these two remarkable dancers in a breathtaking duet that begins at high intensity and builds from there. He's a tough guy who doesn't want to acknowledge the power this particular woman holds over him. She likes to play the field and doesn't care that he's singled her out for attention. But their limbs don't seem to want to obey their wills and keep entangling themselves in ways that appear to defy the limits of human physics. Ms. Tharp's intricately choreographed battle for supremacy ends in a draw but not before both the magnificently limber Ms. Plantadit and the commanding Mr. Roberts have demonstrated how the powerful connection between two performers can ignite a stage without a word being spoken.

2010-05-16T00:00:00Z,"WALKING AMONG GIANTS IN MUIR WOODS NATIONAL MONUMENT, CALIF., MAY 2, 2010. Carrie Terraferma, 31, a paralegal from Latham, N.Y., celebrates her first anniversary with her husband, Eric, on a morning hike through the redwoods. ''Neither of us had seen the redwoods, so it was beautiful to share the experience together on our anniversary, walking along the path, holding hands. They were so much larger than I expected, and the woods themselves are so dense -- the way the light comes in, it doesn't shine directly in, it just filters through in pieces. You read the placards as you walk along, and I guess most of the coast was covered with redwoods at one time, but they've been destroyed to make way for people. It's just a shame. But it's wonderful that Muir Woods has been preserved for future generations. Because they're absolutely magnificent -- I mean they're more than just trees. They're just so impressive when you're standing there, and you feel a centimeter tall. You look up and you can't even begin to see the tops of them.'' As told to Austin Considine"

2010-05-16T00:00:00Z,"AMONG the Japanese directors who came of age after World War II, Nagisa Oshima is perhaps the most provocative. Mr. Oshima achieved worldwide fame with the 1976 release of his sexually explicit art-house hit ''In the Realm of the Senses.'' Based on a true incident from the 1930s, it tells the story of a couple who withdrew from the increasingly authoritarian culture of imperial Japan into a private world of nearly constant sexual stimulation. The idyll comes to an end when the male partner dies during an act of erotic asphyxiation, and the woman, refusing to relinquish her happiness, cuts off his penis as a keepsake."
2010-05-16T00:00:00Z,"It's not as if anyone is ever at a loss for words in John Logan's ''Red.'' So many of them are uttered, with such sharpshooting intensity and theatrical flourish, you wouldn't think there would be much room for the unspoken. But there comes a moment in this concentrated study of artistic creation when the painter Mark Rothko (Alfred Molina) and his young assistant, Ken (Eddie Redmayne, far right, with Mr. Molina), lay down their words, pick up their brushes and get physical. If the play has been acted at a fever pitch up to that point, it now rises to a level of heat that thermometers can't measure. What these men are doing here is a workaday task for an artist. They're priming a canvas -- that is, applying the undercoat on which Rothko will subsequently paint. But there's nothing workaday about the fury with which these actors attack their job. They do it with a speed and intensity that suggests both rage and ecstasy, antagonistic competitiveness and familial collaboration. The primer, by the way, is red, and it gets all over these guys' clothes and skin, and they're soon looking like desperadoes at the end of a Sam Peckinpah movie. Are they making love or war? The mood music that Rothko has put on, a soaring aria from Gluck's ''Iphigénie en Aulide,'' is equally appropriate to either activity. And all the talk that has preceded this scene -- about the Dionysian spirit and the Oedipal clash of artistic generations -- and the implicit mutual resentment and fascination that has been festering between the men find a pulse-quickening, visceral outlet. The director, Michael Grandage, and his actors have given us a physical -- and triumphantly theatrical -- correlative for intellectual tensions. Mr. Molina and Mr. Redmayne are breathing hard by the end of this scene. So is the audience, which probably feels as one that a post-coital cigarette wouldn't be inappropriate. BEN BRANTLEY"

2010-05-16T00:00:00Z,"The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is already causing more than environmental damage. It is disrupting the region's economy, and far beyond the oil industry. Fishing and shrimping boats that normally ply the gulf's waters have been idled amid a fishing ban. And, not surprisingly, charter excursions have plummeted. As a result, companies that normally make money in other ways have tried to make up their losses by offering services to people who have descended on the area to contain and explain the spill."

2010-05-16T00:00:00Z,"Two weeks ago Harlem lost one of its most stylish and most respected residents in Evelyn Cunningham. She was 94. Ms. Cunningham attracted this photographer's eye with her style, her sense of proportion and her balance of color, which she used to elongate her 5-foot-8 stature. Her hands gave her the expressiveness of a Giacometti sculpture, not unlike the style of Diana Vreeland. The thoughts and works of Ms. Cunningham were even more decorated. She began her career at The Pittsburgh Courier, at a time when most female journalists were limited to the women's pages, and became a chronicler of the civil rights movement. In the 1960s, Gov. Nelson Rockefeller made her an adviser, and she later followed him to Washington when he became vice president under Gerald R. Ford. Ms. Cunningham's fashion message set a standard for women in Harlem, from her long dangling earrings, to her playful use of scarves, right. But most important were the length of jackets and coats, used to stretch her figure. A perfect example was the short bolero jacket worn with a floor-length Pucci evening dress. The same dress was worn to a garden luncheon with a knee-length coat. She also wore dresses with a print on the bias. Equally notable was her enthusiasm for the Saint Laurent smoking pantsuit. 1. Ms. Cunningham, second from right, was a mentor to young people. 2. Inger, left, and Osborn Elliott with Ms. Cunningham. 3. The artist Barkley L. Hendricks with Ms. Cunningham."

Take, for instance, the online stir last month when Heidi Klum stepped out in Hollywood with straight-from-the-shower hair. ''Jeez, Heidi,'' blasted the British gossip rag Heat, ''as if your soccer mom haircut wasn't bad enough, you've now started using lard as a styling product.'' So not everyone's a fan. On the flip side, we found it rather fetching. ''It gives women a modern elegance in a very chic way,'' said Luigi Murenu, the stylist and global creative consultant at John Frieda who created the look for the MaxMara (left) and Gucci (right) spring shows. To achieve it, he suggests using John Frieda Root Awakening Strength Restoring Gel on the top and sides of the head, then combing the hair back, leaving the ends alone to allow for movement. ''The best part about the look,'' he added, ''is it works well with all hair textures.'' The worst? See lard reference above."

2010-05-16T00:00:00Z,International JAPAN'S WHALING FLEET SITS IN UNCERTAIN WATERS
2010-05-16T00:00:00Z,"Sometimes (as Blanche du Bois said in one of her few hopeful moments in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'') there is God so quickly. The god, in this case, is Eros, who makes a delayed but galvanizing (and hilarious) appearance at the beginning of the second act of Rob Ashford's revival of ''Promises, Promises,'' the 1968 musical about the dangers of interoffice bed hopping. A production that has thus far lacked sexual energy suddenly wakes up and turns frisky. So does its leading man, Sean Hayes, who -- despite being cast opposite the appealing Kristin Chenoweth -- has given the impression of someone still waiting for a playmate to bring out the devil inside him. Enter Katie Finneran, below with Mr. Hayes, wreathed in black owl feathers and the haze of too many cocktails to count. Ms. Finneran, who won a Tony as the nearsighted ingénue in the great backstage farce ''Noises Off,'' is this time playing someone whose myopia is alcohol-induced. But if her vision is as fuzzy as her molting jacket, her presence couldn't be sharper. Portraying a barfly whose pickup shtick is insisting that she is not a pickup, Ms. Finneran turns the state of being lonely, randy, sloppy and drunk into a precise comic ballet. Make that a double, or do I mean, pas de deux? Because Mr. Hayes, whose character has been slinging back a few himself, matches Ms. Finneran stumble for stumble, hiccup for hiccup and slurred innuendo for slurred innuendo. And a show about the desperation of the Swinging '60s comes to full, uninhibited life for the first time. The loopy, forward-rushing, blissfully idiotic complicity between Mr. Hayes and Ms. Finneran here will be familiar to all survivors of bad one-night stands that seemed like such good ideas before those rotten mornings after.

The result is the Me Collectors Room Berlin (Auguststrasse 68; me-berlin.com), a two-story showroom that opened to the public on May 1. ''Art has to come to people,'' said Mr. Olbricht, referring to the need for the new space, where pieces from his collection and the private collections of others will rotate regularly. Art by big names like Cindy Sherman and Andy Warhol hang alongside that of lesser-known international contemporary artists. And the Collectors Room has a decidedly irreverent tone: One of the primary works in the opening exhibition is Kehinde Wiley's giant Baroque-style portrait of Michael Jackson on a horse; another is a sculpture of phalluses that casts a shadow in the form of a human head."

Upon Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, Frank took up arms in defense of Warsaw against the German army. In the ensuing months following Poland's occupation, Frank remained in Warsaw as a volunteer for the Joint Jewish Distribution Committee. Between 1940 and 1943, Frank lived in the Warsaw Ghetto, active in its Zionist organization, and was secretary of a Jewish Youth Committee, an underground elementary school teacher, and a member of the Jewish resistance smuggling food into and messages in and out of the Ghetto, culminating in his leading the escape of 20 Jews from the Ghetto, following which he secretly lived for a time outside the Ghetto, working with the Polish Jewish underground. In May, 1943, Frank surrendered himself to the Nazi SS to rejoin his father and brother, who remained incarcerated in the Ghetto. After his arrest and deportation, and in the ensuing three years up to his liberation on May 5, 1945 by American invasionary forces from the Mauthausen death camp, Frank miraculously survived eight Nazi labor/concentration camps in Poland, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Austria. Between the end of the war and 1949, Frank lived in US-occupied zones in Austria and Germany, was employed by the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, served the American military in the covert intelligence activities, and headed the Immigration Department of Jewish Agency for Palestine. In April, 1949, Frank and his now-deceased wife, Ella Zlotnik, herself a survivor of Nazi atrocities, immigrated to New York City where he remained and raised his family. He became a successful businessman and in 1966 founded Galaxy Metals Inc. Frank epitomized the human spirits of strength, defiance of evil, survival and hope...his forever enduring legacy. Frank is survived by his son Mitchel H. Perkiel and daughter-in-law Lois Perkiel, and his daughter Anita Perkiel Sarna and son-in-law Mark Sarna, and his six grandchildren, Joshua, Alexa and Griffin Perkiel and Danielle, Ilana and Ari Sarna."

Only about 6 percent of stops resulted in arrests. Civil liberties advocates said the statistics showed prejudice on the part of officers; police officials defended the stop-and-frisk effort as an effective way to deter criminals from carrying weapons on the street."

2010-05-16T00:00:00Z,"As a general rule, marriage isn't sexy on Broadway. True, there is the occasional exception, like Stanley and Stella Kowalski in ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' but they're still virtually newlyweds, for whom the first erotic blush has yet to fade. When it comes to watching the portrayal of middle-aged couples who have been together for years, no one expects fireworks. Yet as the careworn, penny-counting Troy and Rose Maxson in Kenny Leon's warm revival of August Wilson's ''Fences,'' Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, left, light up the sky pretty much every time they touch. Troy, a sanitation worker, and Rose have been together for almost two decades, and they fall easily into the ritualistic, Punch-and-Judy squabbling common to couples of long standing. But from the opening scene, when Rose walks onto the sagging back porch of Santo Loquasto's set and hears her husband talking big, as usual, to his best friend (Stephen McKinley Henderson), you sense an electric current running between this husband and wife."
2010-05-16T00:00:00Z,"Sometimes all it takes to get electricity going onstage is a little actual electricity. Sarah Ruhl's smart comedy ''In the Next Room, or the vibrator play'' examined the divide between women's lives and men's perceptions of them at the turn of the 20th century, when electric currents in the home were brand new. Laura Benanti starred as a loving wife and new mother who nevertheless felt lonely and unsatisfied, locked away from the busy, intriguing world of her husband, a doctor played by Michael Cerveris, who specialized in treating women's ''hysteria.'' His instrument of choice: a peculiar-looking electrical contraption that few would recognize today as the apparatus of the title. In a larger sense Ms. Benanti's character was also locked outside her own deeper emotional and sexual feelings. While the play culminated in a mystical communion between doctor and wife, the most charged scene of erotic -- and comic -- connection was the passage in which one of his patients, an emotionally frail young woman played by Maria Dizzia, above right with Ms. Benanti, turned the doctor's wife on to the pleasures afforded by that fancy, um, stethoscope."

His theory about why Faisal Shahzad tried to blow up a bomb in Times Square last week is ''jihadi intent.'' Pipes writes dismissively of other explanations - that Shahzad is emotionally unstable, say, or that the bomb was payback for American military action in Pakistan. In Pipes's universe, apparently, these explanations are rivals to the ''jihadi intent'' explanation, and couldn't figure in an account of how Shahzad came to have jihadi intent in the first place."

Turkish cooks, particularly those from the area around the city of Gaziantep, in southeast Turkey, have long incorporated these first fruits into soups, stews and kebabs that can be had only during spring.Fortunately, there are several spots in Istanbul where some of these seasonal dishes can be sampled - at least until the full heat of summer hits."

Rhonda's key roles in the struggle for reproductive rights and justice against human rights abusers the world over made her a role model for legions of colleagues and students. She was a fierce advocate for women's rights and opened new opportunities in the international law arena for challenging violence and other gender-based abuses. In 1980, Rhonda was a central lawyer in two landmark cases, Harris v. McRae, which took a challenge to the Hyde amendment to the Supreme Court, and Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, which ruled that cases involving human rights abuses committed abroad could be brought in U.S. courts. We have lost an irreplaceable force and a very dear friend. A memorial service will be held at Riverside Chapel, 80 W. 76th Street, on May 21 at 11:45am.

2010-05-16T00:00:00Z,"Of course Robin Hood can be an astronaut. Maybe even a girl astronaut. Why not. He has already been a Chicago gangster (that would be ''Robin and the 7 Hoods,'' with Frank Sinatra as Robbo) and a duck (that would be Daffy). Lots of actors have played him, most immortally Errol Flynn, but Douglas Fairbanks, Kevin Costner and Sean Connery (not the laddish version) have also taken an arrow from the quiver. Last week, Ridley Scott's ''Robin Hood'' opened, with Russell Crowe as Robin. The film is something of a prequel to the tale of the band that roams the Sherwood Forest. But it doesn't matter who inhabits the shape-shifting myth or what the setting. There's apparently a Robin Hood for everyone, in these hard times or any other. You don't have to be a socialist intent on relieving the rich of their plunder and redistributing it to the deserving poor. You can be a libertarian or a tea partier, relieving a sprawling government of its extra power and returning it to the people. In the future, perhaps when most of the world is ocean, there might be a band of mermen who raid yachts to provision our dinghies and fatten up the obesity-free friar. Just guessing."

Budgets are not rock bottom but not luxury, either. We're thinking about a long weekend in the Southeast. Any thoughts on hotels, resorts, home rentals, towns? April Sellers,Indianapolis A.In ''Florida Glide'' (Jan. 30, 2009), Christopher Percy Collier took guided kayak day-trips in the Florida Keys. Mr. Collier noted that kayaking is one of the best ways to traverse the shallow waters of the 1,700 or so islands in the Keys, hence the plethora of outfitters, most found on or near U.S. 1. They offer affordable guided trips, from two hours to five-day trips into the Everglades. Read Jennifer Conlin's ''In Everglades, Lunchtime with an Extra Guest'' (June 8, 2008) for more on kayaking in that national park. And check out Tristram Korten's ''Gliding Along the 'Forgotten Coast' of Florida'' (May 3, 2009) for his account of a three-day kayak trip along the Florida Panhandle.

He is best known as ""Mr. Chipwich"", the inventor of the original Chipwich, the ice cream cookie sandwich, of which he was so proud, and which came from a love of dunking cookies in milk. He worked hard his whole life, attending the prestigious Brooklyn Tech High School, and Brooklyn College and New York Law School at night over many years while working jobs at AT&T and CBS. Chipwich Chippoppity, a cookie candy, came out of the Chipwich brand and at its second release functioned in conjunction with MyStudentBiz, a business which allowed students to earn money, scholarships, and own a part of the company. His goal was to pass on the entrepreneurship skills he had learned, by mentoring students and helping anyone who asked for his advice. He loved helping people in any way he could, notorious for giving a helping hand to the homeless, and teaching his children to do the same. His generosity was outstanding, and a large part of his life. He created companies that would help people, like his current company, The MD System, an all-natural pain relief system, which will continue on. He loved reading and music, talking sports, car rides, having dinners with his older daughter, watching his younger daughter play sports, always an incredibly devoted family man. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to The Richard Edmund LaMotta Foundation at P.O. Box 309, Mount Kisco, NY 10549. Survived by his wife, son, two daughters, and a granddaughter. Pre-deceased by son and brother. The wake will be at Beecher Funeral Home in Pleasantville, NY on Saturday from 2-4pm and 7-9pm and Sunday from 2-4pm."

He studied geology at Tufts University, and was drafted into the army during the Korean War. After his first wife, Elaine Cohen, died tragically from cancer, he went on to earn his Masters and PhD degrees in geology, and work as a miner and researcher in the southwestern US. Seymour then married Elizabeth Jenifer Slack, had two children, and moved into the exploding field of semi-conductors and integrated circuits, ultimately ending his career as a respected and outspoken pundit in the personal computer industry. He earned numerous patents, industry awards, and formal recognition for his myriad accomplishments. After losing Elizabeth to cancer, Seymour fulfilled a life-long dream to return to the Southwest, settling in Santa Fe, NM thirteen years ago. He fell in love with and married Helene C. Singer, paraded his Great Dane, Sabrina through town daily, and helped finance and guide non-profit projects involving crypto-Jewish history and Native American arts and scholarship. Seymour is survived by Helene; his son Charles and daughter-in-law Ivonne; his daughter Marianne Weights; five grandchildren, Bryan, Sydney, Alexander, Siena, and Mateo; his brother Edward and wife Vivian; numerous step children, step grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and loving friends; and his beloved dog, Sabrina. Seymour would be honored with remembrances to The Museum of New Mexico Foundation- Crypto-Jewish Project (P.O. Box 2065, Santa Fe, NM 87504-2065) or PMS Hospice (1400 Chama Avenue, Santa Fe, NM 87505-3372). A memorial service will be held at 2pm, 24 May 2010, at the New Mexico History Museum in Santa Fe."
2010-05-16T00:00:00Z,"Great chemistry usually requires two or more actors, but Christopher Walken is expert at playing solitary souls whose deepest emotional connections are with unseen characters (a fellow soldier in ''Pulp Fiction,'' a dead Irish boy in ''James Joyce's The Dead''). As the mysterious, obsessive one-handed man Carmichael in Martin McDonagh's play ''A Behanding in Spokane'' Mr. Walken is never more engaging or empathetic (or hilarious) than during his five-minute conversation -- unusually long for Broadway -- with his offstage, elderly mother. Carmichael has lived most of his life with this woman, and Mr. Walken is by turns annoyed, aghast and revealingly tender during this one-sided conversation about his mother's fall out of a tree. ''I'll tell you what your problem is, Ma, you wanna know what your problem is? You're anal, that's what your problem is,'' Mr. Walken says into the phone. After a beat his voice adopts an edge of weary frustration that you imagine is as old as Carmichael. ''Yes, you are anal.'' The mother-son talk is not only a key plot point -- she inadvertently turns him away from killing one of the other characters -- but also a master class by Mr. Walken on how to play a confrontation all on your own.PATRICK HEALY"

2010-05-18T00:00:00Z,"JACOBSON--Charlotte. Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, mourns the passing of Charlotte Jacobson, one of the towering figures of the Zionist movement, who died Friday, May 14, in Florida. In addition to serving as Hadassah's National President from 1964 to 1968, over the course of the past 60 years she occupied a vast range of key positions in the American and world Zionist leadership. ""The Jewish people, Israel and Hadassah have lost a monumental figure, a role model that virtually every Zionist activist has tried to emulate for more than half a century,"" said Nancy Falchuk, Hadassah's current president. ""We are tremendously sad at her passing but also incredibly grateful for the legacy she left us."" Ms. Jacobson served as Hadassah's President during the momentous period of the Six Day War. After the fighting stopped, she was able to reclaim two key pieces of ground in Jerusalem that Hadassah had lost 19 years earlier, during Israel's War of Independence. One was the Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus. The other was the gravesite of Henrietta Szold, Hadassah's founder, on the Mount of Olives. One of the key positions she held after her presidency ended was chair of Building and Development for the Hadassah Medical Organization. In that post she supervised the rebuilding of the Mount Scopus Hospital as well as the building of the Moshe Sharett Institute of Oncology. Born into a Zionist family in New York, Charlotte Jacobson grew up with the movement to create a Jewish state. She made her first visit to Israel in 1951, three years after independence. Though much of her contribution to Israel and the Zionist movement came through her leadership of Hadassah, she also served on the board of directors of the Hebrew University, the Jewish Agency, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency and the American Zionist Youth Foundation. From 1971 to 1982 she served as chair of the American Section of the World Zionist Organization. In 1981 she became the first woman elected to the presidency of the Jewish National Fund. She traveled the world in defense of Jewish rights, meeting with refuseniks and facing commissars in the Soviet Union, and advocating freedom of worship and emigration in front of the leaders of Syria and Egypt. She also defended Israel and the Jewish people in the halls and overseas conferences of the United Nations. Within Hadassah she held a wide range of leadership positions during the course of her career. Among many other posts, she served as chair of the Hadassah College of Technology (today Hadassah College Jerusalem) and Hadassah Magazine. She chaired the Young Judaea Alumni Association, the committee to observe the Zionist movement's 100th anniversary and the Jerusalem 3000 Special Events Committee. She was also responsible for the first USAID grant of $1 million to Hadassah in 1968. She was also a long time member of Hadassah's national board and a mentor of Kibbutz Ketura, where a building and plaza bear her name. In 1998, Ms. Jacobson received Hadassah's coveted Henrietta Szold Award, becoming the first Hadassah leader so honored. Reserved for world leaders, previous Henrietta Szold awardees included Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Golda Meir, Yitzhak Rabin, Simon Wiesenthal and Elie Wiesel. Charlotte Jacobson was a leader for all seasons. Hadassah mourns her today, but we know that generations after we are gone, our descendants will know her name and benefit from its blessings. Donations in her memory may be sent to Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, Hadassah House, 50 West 58th St., New York, NY 10019."

They had been raised since infancy to devote themselves to fighting. They were very sinful. They particularly were into coveting wives. And they were very religious. The fact that these things can be combined strikes the modern mind as bizarre. But you have to deal with it if you're going to understand these people. They would commit a horrid crime, and their confessor would say, 'I don't know if you can ever get over that one. I don't know if atonement is in the books for you. But you better walk barefoot to the Holy Land and hope that that works.' And they'd go. And then come back and sin some more."""

2010-05-19T17:49:11Z,"CANNES, France - The Cannes Film Festival has become the go-to event to see premieres of backbreaking biopics about far-left (and far-out) Latino warriors: in 2008, Steven Soderbergh's 286-minute ""Che"" played here and on Wednesday, Olivier Assayas's 333-minute ""Carlos"" did. Long before the festival opened, this 5 hour 33 minute movie about the Venezuelan-born terrorist, international man of mystery and brutishly committed ladies' man, Ilich Ramírez Sánchez - i.e., Carlos the Jackal - was a must-see. The movie, which screened just once, and out of competition, is scheduled to play on French television this week. It is likely to pop up in the United States this fall at the New York Film Festival before it plays on-demand and in good old-fashioned theaters."

Their new monograph, Campana Brothers: Complete Works (So Far), which is published by Rizzoli, may help explain the method behind what often seems like madness. The hefty book was published with three different covers, each of which is a different color and embellished with circular patterns that look hand stitched. ""Our work is very texturized, so we wanted to bring an element of this to the book - to make it an object in itself, to make it feel handmade,"" Humberto explained. He likes the black cover best because it ""shows the lines, the color becomes much more alive."" His brother Fernando prefers the green."

Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett are great; praise the Lord and pass the Oscar campaign. But there are no tights in this Nottingham, alas. Despite being an unapologetic old school swashbuckler, Crowe recently apologized in The Chicago Tribune, ""to everybody who wants tights."" They, he said, ""never made sense to me you're a bloke, you live in the forest, and you wear tights?"" Well, yeah, what's the problem? Tights were developed precisely by blokes on horses in forests. (They are cousins of riding breeches.) What's the worst that can happen? You pass a briar, a burr is buried and you get a run in your tights? Man up, Robin Hood, you live life on the run. Crowe should not have cowed from the challenge of tights but since he has, we've compiled some great moments of men in tights."

But at the very least Mark Critz's relatively easy victory in yesterday's special election should throw some cold water on the more optimistic conservative visions for how this November will shake out. Yes, Pat Toomey polls almost as well against the victorious Joe Sestak as he did against against Arlen Specter. But given the mood in the country these days, I bet that Toomey would have preferred to campaign against a turncoat five-term incumbent this autumn, rather than a fresh-faced (by political standards) former rear admiral. And yes, Rand Paul will probably be the next United States senator from Kentucky - but he's clearly less of a shoo-in for the G.O.P. than Trey Grayson likely would have been, had matters been arranged differently."

The fewest number of total album sales, 5.3 million, in a single week since Nielsen SoundScan started its tracking in 1991. Topping this week's Billboard chart is Justin Bieber's ''My World 2.0'' (Island), its fourth time in the spot, with sales of just over 60,000, barely escaping the specter of being the lowest selling No. 1 album in SoundScan's history. (The ''Dreamgirls'' soundtrack sold about 300 fewer copies in January 2007.) Lady Antebellum's ''Need You Now'' (Capitol Nashville), the year's most consistent seller, stayed at No. 2 for the fourth straight week, moving 54,000 copies. The top new album was ''High Violet'' (4AD) from the National, selling 51,000 copies, good enough for No. 3. Other new releases in the top 10 were Dead Weather's ''Sea of Cowards'' ( Warner Bros. ), and Charice's self-titled album (Reprise). ''The Oracle'' (Universal Republic), by the metal band Godsmack, dropped from its top spot last week down to No. 9, with sales of 43,000, 63 percent less than the week before. ''While there's a lot of talk of declining album sales, a number of highly anticipated albums are scheduled for release in the next few months and we expect sales to trend upward,'' Eric Weinberg, president Nielsen Entertainment, said in a statement."

Here's why: Directed by Olivier Assayas, the film is a 5-hour, 33-minute portrait of the terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal. It will be shown on French television this week and is scheduled to open in the United States in the fall. It's a fascinating work about an uninteresting brutish historical figure and I haven't stopped thinking about it since I saw it. The thin visual quality of the images and occasional tell-tale splotches of yellow in white images strongly suggested that we were looking at a movie that had been shot in digital, perhaps with the RED, the camera which Steven Soderbergh used to shoot ""Che,"" his movie about Che Guevara, which played at Cannes in 2008."

In my post on core inflation, I explained the Platonic ideal of what we're trying to measure: it's prices that aren't revised often, and are therefore set with future inflation in mind. The standard measure of core inflation tries to get at this ideal in a rough and ready way, by excluding food and energy; other measures exclude all prices that have changed a lot in any given month. But Bryan and Meyer use a more direct approach, looking at goods whose prices can be shown directly not to change very often; these core goods make up about 70 percent of the CPI."

It's a minimalist line aiming for friendlier prices in a world saturated with them. The standout piece among those presented was the print scarf dress, and I liked the crisp look of the trench skirt and the flattering cut of the slim pants. The kelly-green trench dress was cute, too. Though I saw connections to the Jil Sander aesthetic, past and present, those design values can be found in many places-Uniqlo, Calvin Klein, Banana. Last year, I bought a Jil Sander pre-season draped-front dress in navy cotton jersey for about $590. I've gotten lots of mileage out it, and it's probably less money than some of the Navy pieces. So what am I getting? We're all making those kinds of decisions about clothes. Is a $200 pair of leggings or pants really worth it or will I trade up to something with a little more design? Will I stick with a trusty designer label and just buy less? Clearly a task before the team designing Navy-which is not Raf Simons' team for the main Jil collections-is to create smart, useful pieces that are a skip ahead of the ""lifestyle"" miasma."

2010-05-23T20:54:36Z,"Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, has a vision of how the foreboding national political environment might evolve to his party's advantage."

2010-05-23T19:58:43Z,"Unless you work for ABC or share Desmond's ability to shuttle back and forth through time, you probably don't know how the ""Lost"" finale is going to turn out yet. But that hasn't stopped avid Twitter-ers from taking their best guesses at what the show's last episode might have in store - or just cracking wise about the occasion. (Above, the comedian Paul Scheer predicts a best-case scenario for devotees of ""Lost"" and ""Breaking Bad,"" who will have to miss one show or the other on Sunday night.)"
2010-05-23T18:52:14Z,"Jonathan Chait has an item about the largely successful attempt not just to blame Obama for our current economic difficulties, but to ""socially stigmatize"" anyone who points out that most of the blame actually lies with his predecessor. Indeed. And may I point out that the sainted Reagan was still very much blaming Jimmy Carter for the economy's troubles well past this point in his administration? (Not to mention that circa 2004 the Bushies were still trying to get the NBER to postdate the beginning of the 2001 recession back to Clinton.)"

It's important to recall, as you gas up or pay your bill for heating oil, that there are invisible costs of many kinds attending the conveniences of the fossil-fuel age."
2010-05-23T17:05:14Z,"Performance art, as currently practiced, emerged as an avant garde movement in the 1960s and '70s, and some of its features made it difficult to visualize how it might make the transition from galleries and public spaces to the more institutional environment of the museum."

And in keeping with the work of this American independent auteur, it is premised on getting close, often disturbingly so, to the character under scrutiny. The difference is that this time, the character herself is hard to keep in focus."

2010-05-23T15:13:31Z,"CANNES, France - At 8:30 a.m. on Friday at the Cannes Film Festival, just before the first daily screening, attendees were greeted with a disquieting sight: four police vans were parked in front of the festival headquarters and numerous gendarmes, some in riot gear, had taken up position on the street and even next to the red carpet. We festival-goers are used to security checks at Cannes. Guards electronically check your bags whenever you enter the headquarters, a massive building called the Palais. Another guard checks or rather glances at the contents of your bags, while a third passes an electronic wand over your body, rituals that grow lax as the festival wears on. (Similar security checks are common at studio screenings in the United States.)"

2010-05-23T11:49:18Z,"The casting and performances on ""Friday Night Lights'' are so famously top-notch every week that the slightest deviation from the sublime can really irritate (see my harping about Kyle Chandler last week) and, at the same time any moment can get lost in the whole. So let's take some time to celebrate Brad Leland as Buddy Garrity, the most purely avid patron of high school football in all of Dillon (O.K. maybe all of Texas). I say ""purely'' because Buddy has been supplanted this season and last by the twisted Panther fanatic Joe McCoy whose interest in Panther football is more or less entirely a function of his obsessive control of his star quarterback son. Except for Julie Taylor no kid in Dillon really avoids abuse of some kind - mostly it is the abuse of absent parentage - but in young J.D. McCoy's case the abuse is both emotional and physical. Joe McCoy is a really, really awful guy - venal, entitled, misogynistic- - and Buddy has finally had enough of him. Poolside at Joe's giant house - a house that seems like one big wet bar - Buddy gives it to him and calls him a cancer for poisoning the well of Dillon football love with his base antagonisms and threats and psycho micro-managing."

The meat stew cozido, for example, is made with tender chunks of picanha braised in red wine, and the caipirinhas are flecked with bright red ají peppers from the mountains of his homeland.

2010-05-23T00:00:00Z,"McNEIL--Robert L.,Jr., 94, of Wyndmoor, PA., entrepreneur, innovator, philanthropist, patron of the arts and a founding father of the modern pharmaceutical industry, died of heart failure on Thursday, May 20, 2010 at his home in the company of his loving family. Mr. McNeil began his illustrious career when he joined, part-time in 1936 and full-time in 1938, the family pharmacy business founded by his grandfather, Robert McNeil. Together with his father, Robert Lincoln McNeil, and his brother, Henry, he expanded and developed the business into McNeil Laboratories, now a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary, based in Fort Washington, PA. Early in his tenure at McNeil Laboratories, Mr. McNeil spearheaded the development of the Butisol family of drugs and, anticipating the world-wide demand for non-aspirin pain relievers, led the team that created Tylenol, including conceiving of the name Acetaminophen, the generic term for the drug. As McNeil Laboratories grew, so did Mr. McNeil's responsibilities. In 1956, he was named Chairman of the Board and Senior Officer. Aware that a privately held, medium-sized pharmaceutical company would have only limited opportunities for further growth, the McNeil family accepted a purchase offer for McNeil Laboratories from Johnson & Johnson in 1959. Mr. McNeil remained with the J&J subsidiary as Chairman until 1964 to ensure a smooth transition and integration. A major influence within the pharmaceutical industry, Mr. McNeil served as a Director of the American Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, President of the Philadelphia Drug Exchange, President of the Philadelphia branch of the American Pharmaceutical Association, and a member of the Pennsylvania Drug, Device and Cosmetic Board. In 2005, Mr. McNeil received the prestigious American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal as part of Heritage Day at the Chemical Heritage Foundation. ""Retirement from McNeil Laboratories marked the start of a whole new adventure,"" said his son, Rory McNeil. ""He was able to devote more time to our family, to the arts and to various philanthropies. He was always into something."" A long-time supporter of the Philadelphia Zoo, Mr. McNeil recently provided funding for the renovation of the McNeil Avian Center. Vikram H. Dewan, President and CEO of the Zoo commented on Mr. McNeil's longstanding support, ""Bob McNeil's philanthropy was both abundant and visionary the McNeil Avian Center exists as a result of his generosity and farsightedness, changing the way visitors think about the Zoo. His commitment to preservation helped maintain the architectural integrity of the existing building while creating a state-of-the-art exhibit and implementing leading-edge energy conservation strategies. The McNeil Avian Center at the Philadelphia Zoo has served as an important catalyst for raising the Zoos attendance levels, positively impacting the Zoo's financial transformation and increasing the Zoo's visibility as a leading conservation and wildlife organization."" An avid supporter and collector of American fine and decorative arts, Mr. McNeil served as a Commissioner of the National Portrait Gallery, a member of the White House Preservation Committee, and a Trustee of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. His commitment to American culture was underscored by his championing of The Center of American Art at the museum through endowing the chair of Dr. Kathleen A. Foster, the Robert L. McNeil, Jr. Senior Curator of American Art and Director of the Center. As founder of the Barra Foundation, his devotion to Philadelphia arts and culture was further demonstrated through the Foundation's publication of 39-books, including Philadelphia: A 300 Year History published in 1982 and the trilogy by Roger Moss with Tom Crane: Historic Houses of Philadelphia, Historic Sacred Places of Philadelphia and Landmarks of Philadelphia in 2008. Also through the Barra Foundation, Mr. McNeil contributed to promoting education throughout Southeastern Pennsylvania, and provided funding for programs serving the homeless and disadvantaged. More recently, Mr. McNeil's longtime love of the Academy of Music was demonstrated by his generous support of the refurbishment of the Academy's central chandelier and those in the ballroom. Mr. McNeil was born in Bethel, Conn., during a family trip to visit his maternal grandparents. His immediate family resided in Germantown, PA., where he began his education at Germantown Academy, beginning a more than nine-decade relationship with the school, from which he was graduated in 1932. He attended Yale University and was a proud member of the Class of 1936, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree. In 1938, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Pharmacy from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science (now USP) while simultaneously doing graduate work in Pharmacology at Temple University. He received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from USP in 1970. Mr. McNeil, and his brother Henry, supported the construction of a new building at USP in honor of their father, Robert Lincoln McNeil. A similar donation to the University of Pennsylvania also honored their father with a structure. A resident of Wyndmoor since 1963, Mr. McNeil had been a member of the Philadelphia Cricket Club, The Philadelphia Club, The Union League of Philadelphia, the Jupiter Island Club (Fla.), and a member of the board of Germantown Academy. He also was a former President of the Sons of the American Revolution, and, ever proud of his family's Scot's heritage, he was a member of the St. Andrew's Society of Philadelphia. In addition to his wife, Nancy, he is survived by his sons, Collin Farquhar McNeil and Robert Lincoln McNeil III (Rory), and daughters, Victoria McNeil Le Vine and Joanna McNeil Lewis, and 11 grandchildren. A Memorial Service will be held Saturday June 5th, 2010 at 11:00am in The Presbyterian Church of Chestnut Hill, 8855 Germantown Ave., Philadelphia, PA 19118. Donations in memory of Mr. McNeil may be made to Center for American Art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art or the Community Partnership School, 1936 North Judson St., Philadelphia, PA 19121.

For Hewson, the piece serves as a small reminder of the continent's struggling masses who remain nameless. ''We carry the stories of the people who make our clothes and jewelry with us,'' she says. ''It gives new and different value to each piece.'' Upon learning that the London jeweler Pippa Small designed the necklace in conjunction with Made (made.uk.com), a jewelry company with a charitable arm that promotes education and training in Africa, Hewson dreamed up another way to help. Edun teamed up with the charity to create T-shirts that feature drawings by the children of Kibera (edun.com); all profits will go toward their schooling. WHITNEY VARGAS"

For instance, Mr. Kane, a Scot from outside Glasgow, will say his aim is to produce fashion hits, except it will come out as ''fashion hex.''

They are an odd couple, Mr. Kane and Ms. Versace, in an industry of convenient marriages. Who in the fashion world could compete with her view of glamour?

2010-05-23T00:00:00Z,"Is the urge to exercise bred in our bones? That's the intriguing question that European researchers recently set out to examine by looking at the activity habits of 37,051 sets of twins. Twins are popular with geneticists, because they provide a neat statistical model for determining whether a behavior is influenced by genetics or exclusively by environment. Identical twins share 100 percent of their genome, fraternal twins share 50 percent. All twin pairs, if raised together, share approximately the same early environment. So if a behavior is more common between identical twins than between fraternal twins, it is presumably being directed to some degree by genes. In the study, scientists looked at the decision to exercise or not. They turned to survey data covering twin pairs ages 19 to 40 in Australia, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Although the researchers set a very loose standard of one hour per week of light jogging or an equivalent activity to classify someone as an ''exerciser,'' only about 44 percent of the males and 35 percent of the females met the standard. Across the board, however, the identical-twin pairs were more likely to share an exercise pattern than the fraternal twins."

In Siem Reap, there are a few different little fish spas on the main tourist street. The fish just come up and start nibbling your feet, and then eventually you get a pretty big swarm of them biting in between your toes and on the dead skin. We had an underwater camera so we were sticking it in there and getting photos of our feet with the fish. I guess it lasts maybe 10 or 15 minutes, and then they get a little bit bored of you and finish nibbling. The next day it felt like you'd had a pedicure -- or that someone had given your feet a bit of a scrub. There were definitely a few bigger fish that everyone was worried about when they came swimming toward us: you could really feel them biting more than the others. We called them the Loch Ness Monsters.''"

From Cleveland to Hong Kong, artists, gallery owners, hoteliers and chefs are turning erstwhile areas of urban blight into thriving destinations, reclaiming factories, docklands, even entire industrial zones. It's the meatpacking-district-Tate Modern-Bilbao effect, and it's reached critical mass. ''Artists bring tremendous energy to any community,'' says Flavio Misciattelli, the president of the Fondazione Pastificio Cerere, a contemporary art center inside an old pasta factory in Rome's San Lorenzo neighborhood. Now, what was a dangerous industrial slum, Misciattelli says, ''is someplace vibrant and safe.''

But that is quite different from setting out deliberately to produce that activity as the goal of classroom instruction.

Relations with the French tennis federation were once so embittered that she was refused financial help and was obliged to qualify for the French Open instead of being offered one of the wild cards routinely reserved for talented young French players like her. But Aravane Rezai should feel much more welcome this year at the tournament that matters most to her country, or one of her countries.

2010-05-23T00:00:00Z,"FATHER KNOWS BEST: Last August, Justin Halpern was a 28-year-old semi-employed comedy writer living with his parents in Los Angeles when he decided to start posting his 73-year-old father's irascible, foul-mouthed wisdom on a Twitter feed that we'll call ''Stuff My Dad Says.'' Nine months later, he has more than a million followers, a deal for a sitcom starring William Shatner (tentatively titled ''Bleep My Dad Says'') and a book at No. 8 on the hardcover nonfiction list. It's tough to quote from the book in a family newspaper, but a few recent nuggets from the Twitter feed give a bit of the flavor. On being a proud papa: ''A parent's only as good as their dumbest kid. If one wins a Nobel Prize but the other gets robbed by a hooker, you failed.'' On marriage: ''Pressure? Get married when you want. Your wedding's just one more day in my life I can't wear sweat pants.'' Samuel Halpern, a Southern sharecropper's son and retired doctor of nuclear medicine with a penchant for walking around the house naked, doesn't seem to have granted any interviews (on Bob Saget: ''Remember that face. That's the face of a man who hates himself''), but the old man seems to be taking his newfound celebrity in stride. After Justin worked up the nerve to tell him about the Twitter feed, he laughed and said (more or less): ''I don't care what people think of me. Publish whatever you want. I just got two rules: I'm not talking to anyone, and whatever money you get, keep. I got my own money. I don't need yours.'' The book might make a good Father's Day present, but not for Samuel Halpern, who has a staunchly traditionalist view of gift-giving: ''If it's not bourbon or sweat pants, it's going in the garbage. . . . No, don't get creative. Now is not a creative time. Now is a bourbon and sweat pants time.''"

She married Norman Albert Miller in 1952, and was widowed in 2000. An active volunteer in charitable causes, Adelaide Miller served as the Chairman of a residential housing project managed by the Young Women's Christian Association of New York City, and she was a Director of the YWCA of New York City and also the YWCA of the United States of America. She was a member and Vice President of the Junior League of New York City. She also served two terms on the alumnae board of The Spence School in New York. She lived for many years in Tuxedo Park, New York, where she was an active member, and for four years President, of the Tuxedo Park Garden Club, and an active parishioner of St. Mary's-in-Tuxedo Episcopal Church, having been the Chairman of the St. Mary's Guild. Mrs. Miller was an enthusiastic traveler throughout her life. She visited almost every state in the Union and many Provinces of Canada and traveled extensively in the British Isles, Continental Europe and South America. She was active for many years in the work of the Orange County Republican Party, of which her husband was a committeeman and a Town chairman.

Mr. Berdon joined Ferro, Berdon & Company, a New York based accounting and business advisory firm, at the end of the Second World War and became its senior partner. It became a hugely successful international firm under his leadership. Subsequently, as a result of a merger, Mr. Berdon was chairman of the New York operation of Urbach, Kahn & Werlin, now known as UHY Advisors. Mr. Berdon was a great friend and a trusted advisor to many clients. He also served on the Board of Directors for Barnes & Noble and Beth Israel Hospital in New York. Mr. Berdon acquired ownership of a wide range of business around the world.

The players can spread their wings in glamorous regions they rarely get to explore. Audiences share the thrill of fresh discovery, whether the repertory is standard or the rarest of the rare. Does it matter if the singers are barricaded behind music stands? Or should the concert hall simulate the production values of an actual opera house? Over the years many symphonic institutions have tried, with inconclusive results. In his first season as music director of the New York Philharmonic, Alan Gilbert is pursuing a more experimental, potentially more exciting, agenda.

Earlier this month, David examined trends in college attendance and completion rates through an economic lens in a piece in The Times's Sunday Magazine. Finally, our colleague Floyd Norris examines all of this evidence and renders his own verdict. My article in Sunday's Week in Review, ''Plan B: Skip College,'' has drawn nearly 400 comments from Times readers. In the process, readers underscored the polarizing emotions surrounding the question of whether some students would do well to avoid, or at least delay, enrolling in traditional bachelor's degree programs, in favor of obtaining experience more directly related to the jobs they might do."

Despite being in the red (or perhaps because of it -- cheap rents!), the Greek city is starting to steal the cultural spotlight from the increasingly gentrified Berlin, which seems more interested in spawning an outpost of London's Soho House than in nurturing the careers of creative types. Athens's Kerameikos/Metaxourgeio neighborhood -- which still has its share of drug dealers and prostitutes, like any good arty neighborhood should -- along with the run-down Kypseli district have become the new home for influential galleries like the Breeder and Rebecca Camhi, as well as the biannual ReMap art festival, which included installations in abandoned buildings last summer.

2010-05-23T00:00:00Z,"ROUGH RIDER Who could have seen anything like a future in that drug-glutted roach motel, the San José? It was 1995, and Liz Lambert -- a lawyer, back home in Texas after a stint as a New York City prosecutor -- stumbled out of Austin's famous rock hall the Continental Club, crossed South Congress Avenue and faced her destiny. ''The place looked empty, but it wasn't,'' Lambert says about her first hotel. ''It's just everyone who stayed there didn't have cars or luggage, or come out much during the days.'' Lambert took over the squalid spot with plans to renovate it one room at a time. For that, she needed a loan; every bank balked. ''They said, 'You can't make one room nice, charge $75 and have a hooker next door turning tricks all night.' '' So Lambert worked the front desk for nearly three years, renting rooms for $30 behind a plate-glass window. She befriended the drug addicts, street musicians and prostitutes who called the place home, and made a documentary about them. Finally, she got financing. ''We stripped the place down,'' she says. ''Down to the studs.''"

2010-05-23T00:00:00Z,"Each Thursday, Florence Fabricant gives advice on the fine points of entertaining at home and eating in restaurants. Have a dining dilemma? Ask FloFab.Q.My friend has a horrible habit of e-mailing, texting and using instant messenger during cocktails and dinner. It's horribly annoying when I'm speaking to her and she picks up the phone to respond to a message. What can I do?A.It's a problem that's becoming endemic and offensive. I would simply lay down the law and say, ''I am not going to socialize with you if you're going to be this rude.'' Maybe you don't want to risk losing a friend, but that's up to you to decide. Or the next time this happens, you might text your friend to say, ''Stop it!''Q.I've recently been invited to a good friend's birthday celebration planned by her boyfriend. The boyfriend put together a barbecue and sent the following request:Please bring veggie burgers, whiskey, veggie dogs, beer, veggie ribs, tequila, vegetables, ice, birthday presents/flowers. Not necessarily in that order. Oh, if you eat meat you can bring that too, no judgment! We will supply music, dancing, the birthday girl, guacamole.I believe when you host a party, you should at least provide the basics. I have to admit, the boyfriend is out of work. In this case, I think it would've been more appropriate to say, ''Hey guys, I'm throwing a barbecue, but I need some help with the fixings. Here's what I need, can you pitch in?'' His approach felt demanding and tacky, regardless of his employment status. Is my annoyance justified or am I being uptight?A.The whole thing could have been handled in a more gracious fashion. My first reaction is to wonder whether you personally have to bring all this stuff or whether it's a pick-and-choose affair, like potluck Thanksgiving at our house. I would assume you only have to bring one of these items, but usually when somebody has a potluck they assign various categories in consultation with the guests. For this affair, it's worth calling the host to nail down the specifics. We once did a potluck dinner and didn't specify, and all but one couple brought dessert. My husband was very happy but some of the guests were nonplussed. It would also have been helpful if the host had specified ''no gifts.'' I think if you're expected to bring dinner, it would have been nice to know that you don't have to go shopping for a scarf or sweater, too.Q.I was raised to believe it was polite to offer a tablemate a taste but rude to request one. I eat out once a week with a friend. She always asks to try my selections, even for pretty basic dishes like a Caesar salad. If I offer to split our orders, she always demurs, saying she just wants ''a little taste.'' Then she shovels a heaping forkful into her mouth! I've started ordering identical meals to discourage this, but I am in the wrong?"

2010-05-24T00:00:00Z,"ROSE--Herbert B.,80, died peacefully on May 22. He was the beloved and loving husband of Bernice Rose, and the dear son of the late Elsie and Alex Rose, legendary leader of the American labor movement, founder of the Liberal Party of New York, and an ardent Zionist. He was the brother of the late Carmi Schwartz, and an esteemed and admired uncle, great uncle, cousin, colleague, and friend. Herbert will be missed always. Professionally, he was a leading legal advisor to American Jewish communal organizations. He served with distinction for decades as general counsel to the national United Jewish Appeal. Subsequently he was also counsel to the United Israel Appeal, one of two constituent organizations of the UJA, which was responsible for funding the Jewish Agency for Israel through the UJA/federation campaign. He was legal counsel to the UJA-Federation of Greater New York for many years and was deeply involved in the historic merger of the United Jewish Appeal and the Council of Jewish Federations to create United Jewish Communities, now know as the Jewish Federation of North America. He also served as the general counsel of the American Technion Society. His long career with these organizations saw the unfolding of dramatic events in Israeli and American Jewish life, including wars and terrorism in the Middle East, unprecedented fundraising campaigns, and organizational change in the U.S. He handled his involvement on the frontlines of Jewish history with characteristic poise, equanimity, and brilliance as an attorney and advisor to leading professional and volunteer figures in American Jewish life. Herbert was educated at Harvard Law School and Syracuse University and was for nearly 50 years the senior partner of Rose and Boxer and its predecessor firms. Services will be held on Tuesday, May 25 at 10am at the Metropolitan Synagogue, 40 East 35th Street. Donations may be made in memory of Herbert B. Rose to the American Lung Association."

''For the women, it might be because they borrowed someone's clubs when they started playing or maybe they are using hand-me-down clubs from their husband or boyfriend. They never thought about whether the grips mattered. But when you grip any club, your fingers should touch the other side of your hand below the thumb near the palm."

2010-05-25T16:15:23Z,"Tim Hawkinson likes to tinker. In his first solo exhibition with the Los Angeles gallery Blum & Poe, which opened on Saturday, the artist not only tinkers with scale, moving parts and myriad materials, but also grapples with big life issues like mortality, renewal and the passage of time. The centerpiece of the exhibition is a monumental kinetic sculpture called ""Orrery,"" a reference to apparatuses that represent the motions and phases of the solar system. A larger-than-life figure of a woman, at once benign and sinister - is she Mother Time, perhaps? - sits at a spinning wheel made of recycled plastic bottles. Everything about the sculpture is circular, interconnected and eternally spinning  -- the woman's ears, fingers and the bun on her head;  the spinning wheel and the circular platform on which she sits. Even the pattern on her dress, a motion illusion designed by a Japanese psychology professor, seems to spin. The effect is hypnotic as both viewer and figure cycle between the material and cosmic worlds."

The more formal rituals are matters of tradition, like  memorial services in the field and the escorts who accompany a dead Marine through his or her funeral back home. Some Marines are further memorialized in the names of outposts and landing zones; thus, ""Combat Outpost Hanson"" and the adjacent ""Landing Zone Currier,"" named after two Marines from Kilo Company, Third Battalion, Sixth Marines, who were killed several hundred yards from here in fighting against the Taliban in February.

On May 9, this remarkable woman passed away at 91 with her adoring husband and devoted companion of twenty-two years, Maurice Baker, constantly at her side.

Since 1958, DRF has given over $25.5 million and over 2,000 grants to hearing and balance research. Mrs. Ramsey Baker received letters of commendation from many leaders and well-known people including Hoover, Eisenhower, Helen Keller, Cardinal Spellman, and others. In 1960, Mrs. Ramsey Baker and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery established the National Temporal Bone Banks Program to encourage individuals with ear disorders to pledge their temporal bones at death for scientific research. The program has grown into the National Temporal Bone Hearing and Balance Pathology Resource Registry sponsored by NIH's National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. Mrs. Ramsey Baker is survived by her husband Maurice Baker of Vero Beach, FL, her brother Charles Nicks of Hayesville, NC, her daughters Collette Wynn of Washington Depot, CT, and Janet Conrad of West Chester, PA, eight grandchildren and two great grandchildren.

After retiring, he became an adjunct professor of marketing and advertising at the New York Institute of Technology. It was Mr. Iger's deep love of jazz and Tin Pan Alley that led him to write ""Music of the Golden Age, 1900-1950 and Beyond: A Guide to Popular Composers and Lyricists"" in 1998. The book was praised as a valuable and engaging guide to the work of such major songwriters as Irving Berlin, George Gershwin and Richard Rogers. Mr. Iger also served as a member of the Oceanside School Board and was active in supporting Long Beach Reach and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Arthur Lawrence Iger was born April 13, 1926 in Brooklyn, the son of Joseph Iger and Eva Zwern. He is survived by his spouse Mimi, whom he married in 1947; and by his son Robert A.

2010-05-26T00:00:00Z,"PLANK--Betsy, widely known and respected as the ""First Lady"" of public relations, passed away on May 23, 2010 at age 86. While the term ""pioneer"" is often loosely used, Betsy was a true trailblazer in the field of public relations. She was the first woman to: head a division of Illinois Bell, be elected president of the Publicity Club of Chicago and serve as president of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA), the world's largest association of public relations professionals and students. During her career, Betsy won countless accolades for her dedication and service to public relations. She is the first person ever to have received three of PRSA's top individual honors: the Gold Anvil Award (1977), the Paul M. Lund Public Service Award (1989) and the Patrick Jackson Award for Distinguished Service to PRSA (2001). Betsy also received the Arthur W. Page Society's Distinguished Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Institute for Public Relations' Alexander Hamilton Medal for major contributions to the practice of public relations, in 2000. Betsy was widely recognized for her work in the area of public relations education, as well. In 1967, she helped to create the Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA), and in 1987, was co-chair of a national commission to develop guidelines for undergraduate public relations curricula. In 2005, she established the Plank Center for Leadership in Public Relations at the University of Alabama, her alma mater. Betsy invested equally in the PRSA Foundation, establishing its first endowed scholarship fund as a reminder to senior industry leaders of the need to leave a legacy benefitting the next generation of practitioners, in whom she so richly invested her time and affections. In 2009, the PRSA Foundation recognized Plank for her generous contribution at its inaugural Paladin Award Dinner in New York City. For Betsy, the Plank Scholarship Fund was a way of creating a lasting service to college students entering her much beloved career. Betsy also was a social activist who participated in the 1965 Civil Rights March from Selma to Montgomery. Among those organizations with which she was active, Betsy chaired the Illinois Council on Economic Education and the Citizenship Council of Metropolitan Chicago; served on the boards of the United Way, Girl Scouts USA and Girl Scouts of Chicago; and was founder of The Chicago Network, an association of Chicago professional women. Betsy was preceded in death by her husband, the late Sherman V. Rosenfield. According to her wishes, Betsy will be cremated and the internment will be private. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Plank Center for Leadership in Public Relations, University of Alabama, Box 870172, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487-0172 or online at: http://bit.ly/cAo6V8 (designate Plank Fund). The 32,000 professional and student members of PRSA mourn Betsy's passing and will forever remember her contributions to the society and to the profession she loved."

2010-05-26T00:00:00Z,"GINSBURG--David. The leadership, staff, and worldwide community of the Weizmann Institute of Science deeply mourn the passing of our dear and beloved friend, David Ginsburg, whose tireless efforts on behalf of the Weizmann Institute helped establish it as one of the world's premier centers of research. David was passionately devoted to the Jewish people, the State of Israel, and to the Weizmann Institute for over six decades. A brilliant attorney, his legal advice and advocacy during the crucial weeks preceding the U.S. government's recognition of the new State of Israel were essential to the establishment of the country. David contributed immensely to the success of the Weizmann Institute since its earliest days, and his sustained allegiance has been expressed in manifold ways. He was one of the founders of the Institute and a member of the International Board since 1964. David helped to negotiate a very significant long-term loan to the Institute from the U.S. government. Thanks to this loan, which ultimately became a gift, the Institute was able to undertake the extensive expansion that transformed the campus into a world-class research institution. David was also very instrumental in obtaining assistance for the Institute's Feinberg Graduate School. His wisdom, integrity, goodwill, and expertise have been a blessing. We send heartfelt condolences to the entire Ginsburg family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Lawrence S. Blumberg, Chairman American Committee Pennie Abramson, President American Committee Marshall S. Levin, Executive V.P. & C.E.O.

While it was undisputed that two of the nine accused were in his bodyguard battalion (one of whom was acquitted), the identities of the others remained a subject of dispute. Some evidence suggested that two were not security officials and that the others had worked in security in the neighborhood but were not assigned to Mr. Abdul Mahdi's battalion at the time of the incident. Similarly, the article reported that the gang ''forgot about the security cameras'' and ''they forgot about sunrise, which came before they finished.'' The article should have noted that there was evidence that the cameras were not operational at the time of the robbery and that the gang had escaped before dawn.

American officials were cautious in their public statements, eager to avoid giving the North reason for further escalation. Military officials said no additional American combat forces, warships or aircraft had moved into the region -- a standard practice in many past crises, including one in 2003. Officials watching activity on the ground through satellite photographs said there was no ''unusual'' activity at North Korea's main nuclear test site."

2010-05-26T00:00:00Z,"In the 1980s and 1990s, Joel Forrester, a jazz pianist and composer, belonged to the Microscopic Septet. They wrote and played the theme music for the NPR program ''Fresh Air With Terry Gross,'' which has led some to reckon that it must be the most frequently played jazz recording in history. Mr. Forrester, 63, spoke with Ozier Muhammad for the eighth installment of ''Sounds From Uncommon Spaces.'' His remarks have been condensed and edited for brevity and clarity. My father was a newspaper man. He was a labor writer and editor for The Pittsburgh Press. ... When I was about 11 years old, I was just starting to get interested in jazz. ... My father went to the music critic at The Pittsburgh Press, who was a fellow who really didn't like jazz at all. He talked this fellow into giving my father all the free jazz records he was supposed to review. I inherited all those records. The first record, believe it or not was, ''Modern Jazz Piano: Four Views.'' And the pianists on there were Errol Garnor, Art Tatum, Mary Lou Williams and Lennie Tristano. That music was so weird to me, so exotic to my Pittsburgh experience, that I would hide under the cover and I would put the record player with me under the covers and I would listen to that stuff as if I were in a separate world. One of the other records I got was ''Thelonious Monk - At the Blackhawk,'' a club in San Francisco. Thelonious Monk seemed like a wizard to me."

2010-05-26T00:00:00Z,"POTEET--Russell E.,died in the early evening hours of May 14, 2010. He is now resting free from years of agony, suffering from bone cancer. He was born October 5, 1930 in Agusta, Georgia to Florence Johannsen Poteet and Russell Poteet. He was predeceased by his parents, grandparents, a niece Ann Poteet and cousin Roy Booker. He is survived by Jim Diewold, his life (civil union) partner of 41 years and his cat, Melissa. In Georgia, his brother James Poteet and his wife Frances, a nephew James Poteet and his wife Amy and their very special children Avery and Edy. Also surviving are cousins Florence Chandler, Bill Booker and Kathy Wheale, survivor of Roy Booker. While in high school, Russell got a job at ""Press Radio Sales Co."" doing the promotional art. Here he met life long friend Ann Brotherton of Augusta, GA. Also at this time he was given his first art commission to paint a picture of Ikes Pond, which hangs in Maimes Cabin. He received a wonderful letter of thanks from the Eisenhowers. Eileen Stulb, owner of ""Press Radio"" played pro woman's golf, as a result, Russell designed the first logo for the Pro Women Golf. Russell served in the US Army from 1951 1953. He graduated from the University of Georgia with a BFA degree. He moved to Atlanta to work for Mead Packaging. In 1960 he was transferred to New York City as Art Director for Mead Packaging. Later, he moved to Visual Marketing an industrial design firm, and then to Schenley Distillers as Design Director, doing packaging, labels, bottle and decanter design. In 1984 that company moved to Dallas, TX and Russell and Jim gave up their Manhattan home and moved permanently to their weekend home in Roxbury, CT. Prior to leaving the city, Russell spent carefree weekends sailing the Long Island Sound. After giving up his boat, he bought his first country house in Dover Plains, NY, which led him on a path of buying and remodeling old houses and building new ones. Russell and Jim's homes are some of Litchfield counties most beautiful and functional. Russell had an eye for perfect scale and nothing but quality would do. All their homes are a compliment to Connecticut. They were all published in Colonial Homes magazine. A new career began when in 1990 Russell was fortunate to meet two men who taught furniture making using hand tools as in the 18th century: Gene Landon, of York, PA, and Mack Headley of Williamsburg, VA. This involved commuting to New Jersey and York, PA, for classes and trips to museums and the state rooms at the nation's capital to photograph, measure and draw plans for the 18th century furniture on display, and then making exact copies of them. This is where he met his dear friend Tom DuPrex and his wife Faith. The furniture making led to building a large Georgian house in Roxbury to provide a setting appropriate for the furniture. This required elaborate millwork and carvings, faux marbre, etc. for the house, which was begun in 1997 and finished in 2002. In his spare time Russ took several courses at the New School, which include bread baking, French cooking and auto mechanics. He was also a product of Isabel Oneal. They were two peas in a pod. Russ taught at the Foundation. After a two-year course at the Bronx Botanical Gardens, Russ and Jim became certified landscape designers. No project was too big or too daunting. His entire life was an exhilarating learning process it is only natural that he would be a member of Mensa and Intertel. A memorial gathering will happen on Saturday, June 12, 2010 at 3pm. It will take place at the Watermark at East Hill, 611 East Hill Road, Southbury, CT. All are welcome to come and par-take. Memorial Contributions may be sent to Regional Hospice of Western Connecticut, 405 Main Street, Danbury, CT 06810."

If it needs one run, it can use small-ball strategies like bunting and base stealing to get that run."

The Justice Department announced last weekend that it has dropped its criminal investigation into wrongdoing by the former executives of American International Group Financial Products, or A.I.G.-F.P. - the group inside A.I.G. that foolishly decided to insure billions of dollars of risk in the mortgage market, and got paid millions of dollars for doing so. So the Obama administration, which has repeatedly pilloried banking executives in an effort to build support for its financial reform package, has in one step reduced exponentially the chances of actually holding people on Wall Street accountable for the financial crisis, which was an utterly preventable self-inflicted wound. This is simply incomprehensible."

2010-05-27T12:30:27Z,"I was ""Feeling For"" Clark's desert boots last year and continue to wear my sand suede shoes on a daily basis, with rolled up jeans and khakis (also previously ""felt for"" here). Now with summer arriving next week, I'm excited about a new take on my tried and true uniform: the summer chukka boot. Keds, makers of the classic canvas sneaks, have introduced the Champion Chukka, a high-top spin on their low-top. It's a sleek take on the desert boot, done in breathable, lightweight canvas with a molded rubber bottom. The boots come in a bunch of colors, allowing you to coordinate, clash, neutralize or pop at will. I'm partial to the navy, which will blend with a rolled up jean or be a bit more of an exclamation point with a slender, rolled-up chino. The pale grey is another favorite, more akin to its tonal cousin in suede. These sneaks are also the perfect pairing for shorts, from Bermudas to cargos. Just ditch the socks."

It would restrain 15 named individuals from a variety of activities, including weapons possession, trespassing and witness intimidation. It would also keep suspected gang members from associating with one another in a 100-block swath of the city and impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. In other Bay Area cities, like Fairfield, civil liberties groups have attacked such injunctions as violations of constitutional rights. In Oakland, opponents argue that an injunction would do little to curb crime and much to prompt racial profiling. A report in The Bay Citizen said that a series of at least four killings put law enforcement's focus on the north Oakland group. [The Oakland Tribune, The New York Times, The Bay Citizen]Proposition Billed as Antidote to Polarization | Proposition 14, backed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, is gaining traction. The initiative would replace traditional primaries in state and Congressional elections with twofold elections. All candidates would run in the first round. The top two vote-getters, regardless of party affiliation, or lack thereof, would face each other in the general election. Voters' ultimate choice could be two Republicans or two Democrats, but it is likely that they would be the best-known or the wealthiest of the original field. Supporters say the measure would empower moderates and increase turnout. The state's $19 billion deficit, high unemployment and low morale may help the measure's chances; polls show a majority of voters favor it. [The New York Times]"

This week the show is pretty much everywhere, with a sold-out concert tour coming to Radio City Music Hall and news that Fox, its network, has ordered a third season. Now the show has reached No. 1 on the Billboard album chart for the second time in a month. ''Glee: The Music, Volume 3 - Showstoppers'' (Columbia), the show's fourth release and its third full-length soundtrack, sold 136,000 copies in the United States last week, according to Nielsen SoundScan, beating out a reissue of the Rolling Stones' ''Exile on Main St.'' (Universal) for the top spot.

2010-05-27T00:00:00Z,"Hot news from Paris: After seven years, Jean Paul Gaultier is giving up his ready-to-wear duties at Hermes and will be replaced by Christophe Lemaire, who has been designing for Lacoste since 2000. Mr. Gaultier's move was expected, but the replacement was something of a surprise, since Mr. Lemaire has always flown a bit under the radar and doesn't show his own collection on the runway. Nevertheless Hermes has a tradition of making unexpected hires in the creative department, starting with Martin Margiela, who designed the collection prior to Mr. Gaultier. Mr. Lemaire had worked for numerous French design houses, including Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Patou and Christian Lacroix, prior to joining Lacoste. He has been credited with reviving the demand for its crocodile-logo polo shirts by restyling the line with pop colors and trimmer fits, but it's hard not to picture the new job at Hermes as a big step up."

2010-05-28T00:00:00Z,"In major league baseball from 2000 to 2009, the home team won 54 percent of the time. Many cite the home team's last at-bat as the reason. At the end of games, the thinking goes, the home team can tailor its strategy to match the situation. If the team is down by three runs, it can play for the big inning. If it needs one run, it can use small-ball strategies like bunting and base stealing to get that run. If only it were true. Recent research has found that having the last at-bat is not a statistically significant advantage. Three professors - Theodore Turocy, the data manager for the Society for American Baseball Research and an economist at East Anglia University in Norwich, England; and Stephen Shmanske and Franklin Lowenthal, professors at California State University, East Bay - have used simulations and examined data to debunk this myth."

(HBO) THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP (2010) Winston Churchill called it the ''special relationship'': the political, diplomatic, cultural and historical alliance between Britain and the United States, and between their leaders. Churchill had Franklin D. Roosevelt; John F. Kennedy had Harold Macmillan; Margaret Thatcher had Ronald Reagan. And, for a while, Tony Blair had Bill Clinton, which is the relationship at the heart of this third installment in the screenwriter Peter Morgan's trilogy about former Prime Minister Blair. Michael Sheen, above left with Dennis Quaid, reprises his role as Blair, whom he portrayed in ''The Deal'' and ''The Queen''; Mr. Quaid is Clinton; Hope Davis is Hillary Clinton; and Helen McCrory is Cherie Blair. Writing in The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley called Mr. Quaid's and Mr. Sheen's performances ''dazzling,'' and said that Ms. Davis ''all but steals the film.'' The movie ''provides a captivating peek into the meshing of personality and power and how easily even the strong bonds come unglued,'' she wrote. ''Or, as one British political adviser warns in the film, 'All political friendship is strategic and conditional.' '' 6:30 A.M.

Renee began her career in the art world in the New York gallery of the London old master dealer Colnaghi, she then became a specialist in the Impressionist and Modern Paintings department at Christie's.

Renee produced a series of stage shows in East Hampton that featured appearances by performance artists Laurie Anderson and Eric Begosian, among others. Renee's galleries exhibited in the foremost trade shows in New York, Miami, and Paris. Her gallery exhibitions and shows were reviewed by the New York Times, Newsday, and other publications. Renee's residences became the subject of articles and photo essays in Interior Designs magazine, and a leading Westchester publication. Renee was born on January 13th, 1960, in Binghamton, New York. She earned a BA from Vassar College and an MA in Fine Art from New York University. Renee is survived by her beloved son Jordan, husband Henry Scholder, sisters Rebecca Lambert Bent and Deborah Monticello, and her parents Dr. Abol Hassan and Eleanor Fotouhi, as well as by nephews Maxwell S.

She's beaten every big name player, but has a reputation for wilting under the bright lights of a Grand Slam. Sadly, she is known more for her memorable meltdowns (the Melanie Oudin match at last year's United States Open) than for her incredible playing. Her victory Saturday against the crowd favorite, Aravane Rezai, could be a breakthrough for Petrova. The match had been halted at 7 all Friday in the third and resumed earlier Saturday."

They also brought back memories of the championship season of 1969, when Mets pitchers hurled four shutouts in a row, all of them in late September as the team clinched the first division title in its history. Those four shutouts still stand as the team record, but the Mets gave it quite a run Friday night. Johan Santana pitched eight scoreless innings against the Brewers in Milwaukee, but Ryota Igarashi allowed a two-run homer to Corey Hart with two outs in the bottom of the ninth to end the shutout streak at 35 complete innings, seven shy of the team record."

A kind and gentle man, Dr. Ovunc was born in Samsun Turkey in 1927 and attended St. Joseph's College Preparatory School a well-established French school serving Istanbul both in the Ottoman times, and also in modern times. He began his studies in engineering at the Istanbul Technical University in 1949. While there Dr. Ovunc was awarded a scholarship from the French Government to participate in the Prestressed Concrete Course at Ecoles des Arts et des Metiers in Paris and worked on photostress at the Laboratory of Mechanics and Physics of the Sorbonne.

The first issue, which hits newsstands next week, includes conversations with the Love editor Katie Grand, the Net-A-Porter founder Natalie Massenet, the Condé Nast publishing director Tom Florio, and the Balenciaga stylist Marie-Amélie Sauvé, whose itinerant career of late has been rich fodder for the online gossip mills. ''We had questions that other magazines never asked the fashion industry,'' said Industrie's editors in chief, Erik Torstensson and Jens Grede (also the founders of the creative agency Saturday Group), via e-mail. ''We already know who's who, so what can the who's who tell us.''

Just about every automaker is taking a different approach, creating headaches for drivers. One problem is that there is no industry standard, so Nokia and a group of five German automakers are proposing a new way of doing things. The proposed standard was spawned from the CE4A (which stands for Consumer Electronics for Automotive), a working group composed of Audi, BMW, Daimler, Porsche and Volkswagen. The standard is supposed to be open to all automotive and mobile device manufacturers to provide a common way for handsets to work with in-dash systems. In rough terms, the goal is to make it so smartphone developers can create, say, a Pandora application that will work in all cars, and carmakers can install infotainment systems that will work with any smartphone."

She lives in Boca Raton, Fla., where she is raising three teenage sons and has a tennis academy. Evert, 55, continues to promote her sport and was part of the United States Tennis Association's tribute to tennis mothers in May, National Tennis Month. She recently gave a lesson atop the Empire State Building to children from the Harlem Junior Tennis and Education Program. Q. You won the French Open seven times. Can anyone today equal or surpass that?A. That's a hard question. I doubt it, and it's nothing against today's players, but because there is so much more depth right now in the game of tennis, it's harder for any one person to win a lot of Grand Slams. I think it would be really hard and quite an achievement. Q. What are you doing now?A. I have three teenage boys, so my first priority is with my kids, being home with them. I also have my tennis academy in Boca Raton, and I have a hospital named after me that I do a lot of work for. I'm also the publisher of a tennis magazine, but the most important thing for me right now is to be a mom.Q. How concerned are you about Martina Navratilova, who has breast cancer?A. I think she's very optimistic. and I'm optimistic for her. She's strong and she's healthy and she's taking this like a champion, and she knows we are all thinking about her.Q. Are you still playing competitive tennis?A. Not competitive, but I do go to my academy and play there three or four times a week, and that's enough for me right now. I don't play any other sports, though I have gone skiing and I have surfed, but tennis is the main thing.Q. Who is your favorite tennis player? A. Roger Federer has always been my favorite. He's a gentleman. You would want to have him as your son, or your boyfriend or your brother. He's just a wonderful human being. Q. Tell us something no one knows about you.A. I have a dirty sense of humor.Q. Your three marriages ended in divorce. Are you dating, and would you consider marrying again?A. Right now it's the last thing on my mind. I'm not dating.

As we remember the heroes who laid down their lives for freedom, let us also spare a thought for a hero of the mind, who passed away some days ago at the age of 95. When I first encountered Martin Gardner's columns in ""Scientific American"" as a schoolboy many years ago, my reaction was one of awe. Here was pure intelligence incarnate, I thought, coming up with puzzles of mind-bending difficulty month after month and explaining the ideas behind them with crystal clarity. I was convinced that Martin Gardner was the smartest man in the world. The profusion of his writings, their quality and the sheer length of time that he kept on producing them, month after month, were just mind-boggling. When he retired from ""Scientific American"" in 1981, I was convinced that no one could fill his shoes. Although I much admired Douglas Hofstadter, who replaced him, and was a great fan of ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"" I just knew that no one else could keep this up for as long as Martin Gardner had. And so it proved to be. It is a tribute to Martin Gardner's oeuvre that the final considered impression that he left  is not very different from the one seen through the eyes of a hero-worshiping adolescent."

2010-05-31T00:00:00Z,"A new museum for contemporary art and architecture opened in Rome on Sunday, The Associated Press reported. The more than $200 million National Museum of XXI Century Arts, or the Maxxi Museum as it is being called, was designed byZaha Hadid, who began work on the space 11 years ago with the intention of giving a more avant-garde image to a city steeped in Classical art and history. It was built in a residential neighborhood outside the historic city center and consists of white curving concrete walls, intricate black stairways and floor-to-ceiling windows. ''My work just really stems from the fact that we can make new juxtapositions with the old,'' Ms. Hadid, who in 2004 was the first woman to win the Pritzker Architecture Prize, told The Associated Press on Thursday. ''The idea of connecting between the old and new is very critical.'' One of the main inaugural exhibitions, ''Space,'' features works by Anish Kapoor, Sol LeWitt and Francesco Vezzoli, among others, blended with architectural installations. Other exhibitions include a retrospective of the Italian artist Gino De Dominicis, whose 80-foot-long plaster skeleton sculpture lies near the new building's main entrance."

2010-05-31T00:00:00Z,"Ever notice how people typically warm up their short game before a round? They drop three balls on the putting green and putt for five minutes. Then they might hit four or five chip shots from just off the green, often practicing from the same spot. That's better than nothing - and a lot of golfers do nothing before a round - but it's not simulating the golf round that is about to begin and it's not how professional golfers warm up their short games. I have watched Phil Mickelson - pretty good short game, right? - warm up for tournaments dozens of times. His routine will vary a little but if possible he hits chips and putts in succession, not as separate parts of the warmup. In other words, Mickelson takes three balls and hits three chips, usually from different places, and then he putts those three balls. He then chips some more, and putts some more. He alternates short-game shots, just as he will have to during his round. If the practice area allows, and at pro tournaments it often does, Mickelson will even incorporate bunker shots into the routine."

The blaze on Tuesday, above, gutted the company's 8,500-square-foot warehouse, rehearsal space and offices, where it kept items used for its shows and rented to other companies. The theater still expects its next production, ''Thoroughly Modern Millie,'' to begin on July 16. The television and theater actorNeil Patrick Harris, a New Mexico native who performed with the company in his youth, said that he hoped to help raise money for the nonprofit Musical Theater Southwest so it can replenish what it lost. A board member, Rick Huff, said he planned to approach several other alumni, like the film director Penny Marshall and the actors Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Patti Cohenour, to help raise funds to replace what was lost, valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mr. Huff said donations of money, props and costumes had been arriving since the fire. ''We already have a new warehouse a few blocks away from the burned-out shell of the old one,'' he said.

A memorial service will take place at 2:00pm, on Tuesday, June 1, 2010 at Bernheim-Apter-Kreitzman Suburban Funeral Chapel in Livingston (800)938-6372. Jane was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1937. She lived South Orange and Maplewood before moving to Roseland many years ago. She had the uncanny ability to connect with the many people that she came in contact with during her lifetime. She was considered a ""best friend"" by so many. There will be a void in so many lives without her friendship. She attended Simmons College and graduated fro Upsala College. She worked for The New Jersey Law Journal/Lawyers Diary for many years. She retired in 2000. During her lifetime she was an active member of the community. Jane was a lifetime Board Member of Women's Philanthropy of the United Jewish Communities of Metro West. She served in many different positions of the Women's Division UJA campaign. She was a winner of The Julius and Bessie Cohn Young Leadership Award. Jane was a member of the Board of Jespy House. She was a longtime member of Mountain Ridge Country Club where she served on the Board of Governors. Jane will be especially missed by her long time companion, Frank Goodman. For over thirty years they were travel partners enjoying worldwide adventure that included all seven continents. Their favorite city to visit was Paris. When not traveling, Jane and Frank enjoyed the arts, theatre, opera and every museum they could find. They enjoyed tennis, golf, friends and family. Grandmother and dear friend, Jane will be missed by the entire extended Goodman family. Jane is survived by her devoted and caring children Peter Benjamin and Dr. Kate Callahan of Coconut Grove, Florida and James and Jeanne Benjamin of Atlanta, Georgia. She was the cherished grandmother of Jake and Samantha Benjamin and Peter's son, Jason. She was formerly married to the late Donald Benjamin. The family has established the Jane S. Benjamin Scholarship for continuing education for hospital and hospice caregivers at Saint Barnabas Medical Center. In lieu of flowers, please send donations payable to The Saint Barnabas Medical Center Foundation c/o Peter and Kate Benjamin, 2111 Tigertail Avenue, Coconut Grove, Florida, 33133."

2010-05-31T00:00:00Z,"ZALUSKY--Ralph, M.D.,78, of Roslyn, New York, died peacefully on May 28, 2010 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan, where he had retired as chief of Hematology/Oncology after spending nearly 40 years there in dedicated and distinguished service as a physician and professor of medicine. Beloved husband of Marian (Shayon) for 51 years, Dr. Zalusky was the son of the late Elly and Minnie (Goldstein) Zalusky. He leaves behind three children, Jeff Zalusky (Katy Wheaton) of Germantown, MD, Beth Finkelstein (Stuart) of Chappaqua, NY, and Emily Weinfeld (Stuart) of Woodcliff Lake, NJ, and nine grandchildren. Born in Pawtucket Rhode Island in 1931, he was the brother of Dorothy Rodriguez and Rachel Biven, and the late Sarah Zalusky, Bella Massotti, Isaac Zale, Abraham Zale and Joe Zalusky. His early academic success led to an undergraduate degree at Brown University and the decision to pursue his two lifelong passions: medicine and teaching. He received his M.D. at the Boston University School of Medicine in 1957, and did his internship and residency at Duke University Hospital in Durham, NC, where he met and married Marian Shayon. He then returned to Boston to complete a fellowship at Boston City Hospital (Harvard University) in 1961. Subsequently, he had the privilege of working in William Castle's Thorndike Laboratory, also in Boston, where he studied pernicious anemia among many colleagues who would become deans of American investigative medicine. Fulfilling his service to the nation as a captain in the U.S. Air Force, he joined Stanley Schultz in fall of 1962 at the Department of Bionucleonics of the School of Aerospace Medicine in San Antonio (brooks AFB), and coauthored a seminal work on the physiology of membrane ion transport in 1964. Dr. Zalusky moved to New York in 1965, where he served on the staff at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens before joining the Department of Hematology at Mt. Sinai Hospital and then the Beth Israel Hospital in New York City, where he specialized in the treatment of aplastic anemia, leukemia and lymphoma. Throughout his illustrious career, he was recognized and respected as an educator, at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and most recently, from 1994 until his retirement in 2009, as Associate Chairman of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY). He also coauthored over fifty publications in numerous medical journals. Starting this fall, an annual lecture series in his honor will be presented at the Beth Israel hospital. He will be missed by his family, his many friends, and his countless students and colleagues worldwide. By request of the family, in lieu of flowers or other gifts, please consider a donation to Doctors Without Borders, an organization strongly supported by Dr. Zalusky."

2010-05-31T00:00:00Z,"The most distinctive book about Tiger Woods this spring has nothing to do with his recent life and everything to do with the college golf season of 1994-95. So ''The Last Putt: Two Teams, One Dream, and a Freshman Named Tiger'' (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) is not a book written with an eye on Woods's recent tribulations. Still, Woods the teenager and collegian comes alive in new ways, teamed with Notah Begay and Casey Martin in Stanford's face-off at the 1995 N.C.A.A. championship against golf powerhouse Oklahoma State. This is a stroke-by-stroke tale by authors Neil Hayes and Brian Murphy with many subplots, on and off the golf course. The championship comes down to a sudden-death playoff, and so, you have to ask yourself: Who would you want standing over the last putt? This is also the time of the year when people buying golf books are thinking of Father's Day, which may not immediately bring to mind golf blogger Patricia Hannigan's book ''Golf Girl's Little Tartan Book: How to Be True to Your Sex and Get the Most From Your Game'' (Stewart, Tabori & Chang). Then again, it may be the ultimate Father's Day gift if you know a father who has a woman in his life that he wished played more golf. In her entertaining blog, Hannigan often writes about ''girls golf'' as opposed to ''boys club'' golf, and among the chief recommendations of her book is that women ''play golf like girls.'' The book has a lot of attitude, and that's the point, but it has keen observations, too, like an explanation as to why golf rules matter and the importance of playing from the correct tees. But this is no tutorial; it's much more fun than that."

The tribute begins with a trilogy of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, starting at 8 a.m. with ''A Fistful of Dollars'' (1964), starring Mr. Eastwood as a mysterious stranger who plays dueling families against each other in a Mexican border town, and followed at 9:45 by ''For a Few Dollars More'' (1965) and at noon by ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' (1966). Mr. Eastwood steps into his signature role of Harry Callahan, a maverick San Francisco police detective, in a double bill of ''Dirty Harry'' (1971) at 12:15 a.m. Tuesday and ''Magnum Force'' (1973) at 2 a.m. 8 P.M.(ABC) THE BACHELORETTE Ali offers Frank the season's first kiss before driving him to a make-out point overlooking the bright lights of Los Angeles.

Beloved husband of Marian (Shayon) for 51 years, Dr. Zalusky was the son of the late Elly and Minnie (Goldstein) Zalusky. He leaves behind three children, Jeff Zalusky (Katy Wheaton) of Germantown, MD, Beth Finkelstein (Stuart) of Chappaqua, NY, and Emily Weinfeld (Stuart) of Woodcliff Lake, NJ, and nine grandchildren. Born in Pawtucket Rhode Island in 1931, he was the brother of Dorothy Rodriguez and Rachel Biven, and the late Sarah Zalusky, Bella Massotti, Isaac Zale, Abraham Zale and Joe Zalusky. His early academic success led to an undergraduate degree at Brown University and the decision to pursue his two lifelong passions: medicine and teaching. He received his M.D. at the Boston University School of Medicine in 1957, and did his internship and residency at Duke University Hospital in Durham, NC, where he met and married Marian Shayon. He then returned to Boston to complete a fellowship at Boston City Hospital (Harvard University) in 1961. Subsequently, he had the privilege of working in William Castle's Thorndike Laboratory, also in Boston, where he studied pernicious anemia among many colleagues who would become deans of American investigative medicine. Fulfilling his service to the nation as a captain in the U.S. Air Force, he joined Stanley Schultz in fall of 1962 at the Department of Bionucleonics of the School of Aerospace Medicine in San Antonio (brooks AFB), and coauthored a seminal work on the physiology of membrane ion transport in 1964. Dr. Zalusky moved to New York in 1965, where he served on the staff at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens before joining the Department of Hematology at Mt. Sinai Hospital and then the Beth Israel Hospital in New York City, where he specialized in the treatment of aplastic anemia, leukemia and lymphoma. Throughout his illustrious career, he was recognized and respected as an educator, at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and most recently, from 1994 until his retirement in 2009, as Associate Chairman of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY). He also coauthored over fifty publications in numerous medical journals. Starting this fall, an annual lecture series in his honor will be presented at the Beth Israel hospital.

The other is Dorothy Felix, a lifelong resident of Mossville, La., who is trying to force 14 industries to take responsibility for the health issues of residents -- 8 out of 10 of whom have reported illnesses, including cancer and kidney disease -- who say that they're being taken advantage of because they are mostly poor and black.

I'm tired of pop stars who say, 'Give peace a chance.' I'd rather say, 'Give war a chance.' The whole point of going to the Grammys was to say, 'Hey, 50,000 people are gonna die next month, and here's your opportunity to help.' And no one did.''

The part that begins, ''The whole point of going to the Grammys,'' up to the end of the quotation, actually came first. The part that begins, ''I wasn't trying to be like Bono,'' and ends, ''Give war a chance,'' came later in the same interview.

Spread gravel, preferably a natural kind like pea gravel, an inch or two thick in a glass container. Mr. Rose recommends using a 10-gallon fish tank, which is inexpensive and has a large opening that makes it easier to work in, but smaller containers like fishbowls will also work as long as they are transparent.

2010-06-03T00:00:00Z,"As the population ages, home monitoring devices like Lifeline and others -- which keep track of your whereabouts, monitor your bodily functions and remind you to take their medicines -- have become more popular. Lifeline, made by Philips, is easy to use. By pushing a button on a pendant, you connect to a home base station, which automatically alerts a central station that there's an emergency. Trained operators with the customer's medical history can quickly call for help and alert relatives that something's wrong. But the product has one shortcoming; it only works in and around the house. If you're in a distant location and fall, you'll need to either flag a passerby or use a cellphone, neither of which may be practical. Cell phone service could always be used as a way to communicate back to Lifeline, but the company has eschewed that approach, concerned that erratic mobile connections will provide a poor user experience, perhaps at the moment it's needed."

2010-06-03T00:00:00Z,"BOURGEOIS--Louise. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the loss of Louise Bourgeois, a great artist. Louise had a close connection to The Museum from the time Alfred Barr acquired her early prints and sculpture in the late 1940's and early 1950s. Other curators over the years have also strongly supported her work, among them, Deborah Wye, who mounted her first retrospective exhibition in 1982, as well as Rob Storr. Louise's sculptures, prints and drawings, forming a core of our collection, reveal the most essential elements of the human experience with an astounding originality. It is hard to believe that her boundless creativity has come to an end. Louise will be sorely missed, but her piercing vision lives on through her work. We offer our sincere condolences to her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchild, and to her long-time assistant Jerry Gorovoy. The Board of Trustees of The Museum of Modern Art"

Craig Venter announced that he and his team had synthesized a bacterial genome and used it to take over a cell. News of this ''synthetic cell'' resulted in speculation regarding its potential for solutions to global challenges like generating new food sources, drugs and vaccines; cleaning up pollution; devising new energy sources; and producing clean water. (It also led President Obama to ask the White House bioethics commission to complete a study of the issues raised by synthetic biology within six months.) This two-part report, filmed over five years at the J. Craig Venter Institute in San Diego, follows Dr. Venter; Hamilton O. Smith, a microbiologist and Nobel laureate; and Clyde A. Hutchison III, an investigator at the institute, as they work to create this synthetic single-cell organism. ''Creating Synthetic Life: Your Questions Answered'' follows at 9. 8 P.M.

The two wells, aimed at the bottom of the runaway well that has spewed millions of gallons of oil into the gulf, represent the most conventional solution to the disaster and the one that experts say is all but certain to succeed. Once either of the relief wells strikes pay dirt, the plan is to pump heavy drilling mud and cement down it to bring the blowout under control and permanently seal the damaged well."

Or whether the event, billed as a way to spotlight teachers' hidden talents (see video), was really some sort of crafty bargaining tool intended to show them that raises or no raises, they should consider themselves lucky to have their classroom jobs. After all, the Amateur Night audience is notoriously merciless. With dozens of students in the audience of 1,500, the booing came particularly fast and furious.

2010-06-04T00:00:00Z,"Armando Galarraga deserves praise for the way he has handled himself after the blown call by Jim Joyce that cost him a perfect game on Wednesday. Galarraga, the Tigers' right-hander who will henceforth be remembered as the unluckiest pitcher in baseball, sets a great example for children. Trust me, as a Little League coach, I'll be using his example of sportsmanship, perspective and respect for authority. But the notion that Galarraga should be retroactively awarded a perfect game is misguided. It was not a perfect game. The game continued after Joyce awarded Jason Donald first base. A perfect game is defined as a full game in which nobody on a team reaches base. It's simple. And it didn't happen."

Mr. Hopper, the eccentric, wide-eyed actor of ''Apocalypse Now'' and ''Blue Velvet'' and the director, co-writer and co-star of ''Easy Rider,'' died on Saturday from complications of prostate cancer. He was 74. Among relatives who attended the service held at the San Francisco de Asis church were Mr. Hopper's son, Henry Lee Hopper, who read from Walt Whitman's ''Leaves of Grass.'' The memorial, above right, also drew the actors Val Kilmer and Jack Nicholson; Mr. Nicholson appeared in ''Easy Rider'' with Mr. Hopper and remembered his co-star as ''an all-around guy.''

While Hamas took over Gaza by force in 2007, as the article said, the group's representatives had won elections there in January 2006, defeating the more moderate rival Palestinian group Fatah. Subsequent tensions between Hamas and Fatah forces in Gaza led to open fighting, and Hamas routed Fatah from Gaza in June 2007."

Their Whale Defense Campaign takes them on a three-month journey to the South Ocean to stop whaling that the group asserts is illegal and exploits a loophole in international ocean law. At the heart of this series's third season is the imprisonment of Capt. Pete Bethune, whose ship, the Ady Gil, sank after colliding with the Shonan Maru 2 whaling vessel on Jan. 6. In February Captain Bethune was arrested after he boarded the Shonan Maru 2, tried to make a citizen's arrest of the captain and presented him with a $3 million bill for damages. Captain Bethune is now awaiting trial in Tokyo and could be sentenced to 15 years in prison. In the meantime, the Shepherds say that their 2010 Antarctic Defense Campaign has saved 528 whales. 8 P.M.

In many ways, she beat Stosur at her own game, serving big and setting up her groundstrokes to keep Stosur on the move and off-balance."
