2010-06-30T00:00:42Z,"Before New Yorkers hear the sirens, police officers hear this: ""Arrive alive."" That's what the dispatcher announces when handing them a job - 1085, officer needs assistance; meet the E.M.T. unit; shots fired; difficulty breathing; sexual attack; car accident - ""Arrive alive."" Then what? This new series by Ángel Franco of The Times will show what happens after those calls go out, at crimes in progress or crime scenes or crimes under investigation. The series will provide a glimpse behind the police tape; a close-up look at the who, what and when of police calls. Its images will capture investigations into shootings, memorials for murder victims and the reactions of neighbors after the squad cars arrive and the sirens go quiet. As a freelance photojournalist, Mr. Franco spent five years in the late 1970s and early 80s with the officers and detectives of the 46th Precinct in the west-central Bronx, a project described in ""Cops, Neighbors and a Camera in Between"" (Lens, June 24)."

Later published as Physicians in Bureaucracy, her early and influential work helped shape the emerging specialty of medical sociology. It was complemented by her contribution to the 1957 book The Student Physician that described innovative changes to the Comprehensive Care and Teaching Program for fourth-year medical students at Weill Cornell, such as introducing a public health focus on more advanced epidemiologic studies of diseases important to clinicians. As a medical sociologist, often in collaboration with Professor George G. Reader, MD, of Weill Cornell, she subsequently contributed to a wide range of studies on the delivery and effectiveness of medical care that led to her 1972 faculty appointment in the Weill Cornell Department of Public Health. She served a term as Book Review Editor of the American Journal of Sociology, and then was Editor of the Journal of Medical Sociology, now the Journal of Health and Social Behavior, from 1976 to 1978. Along with teaching and administrative responsibilities, her research interests continued until her retirement in 1992. For these and other contributions, she was honored in 2000 with the prestigious Leo G. Reeder Award from the Section of Medical Sociology of the American Sociological Association. Born in Chicago in 1926, she graduated in 1943 from the then Nazareth Academy for Women in LaGrange Park, IL. She then attended the University of Iowa, Iowa City, where in 1947 she received a department honored BA in sociology along with university honors and, in 1948, an MA, also in sociology. Married in 1945 to Albert E. Goss, in 1948 she and he began residency in Amherst, MA where she did fill-in teaching of sociology at Smith College and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. In January 1951, she entered the Ph.D. program in sociology at Columbia University, in which she was a Gilder Fellow from 1952-1953, and began joint residence in New York City and Amherst. In 1966 she, her surviving husband and young son, Charles A. Goss, entered her long residency in Piscataway, NJ. Charles now resides in Chapel Hill, NC with his wife, Karen, and children Jessica and Derek. Her other immediate survivors comprise her sister, Dorothy Weber Inyard and nephew Gary Inyard of Chicago, brother C. Edward Weber and wife Suzanne, of Milwaukee, and nephews Paul Weber of Spencer, WI and Mark Weber of Eden Prairie MN, and their families. A memorial service will be announced later. Her ashes are consigned to the Weber family plot in the Bohemian National Cemetery in Chicago. Memorializing donations should be made to the Weill Cornell Medical College (please write ""Dept. of Public Health in memory of Mary Goss"" in the memo line of the check), Office of Development, 1300 York Avenue, Box 123, New York, NY 10065."

And Ms. Kagan, the solicitor general and former dean of Harvard Law School, refused to say whether the Supreme Court was correct to take on the 2000 case of Bush v.

The article itself referred imprecisely to the significance Monsignor Quinn's canonization would have for Brooklyn. While he is the first person proposed for sainthood by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, as the capsule summary correctly noted, Monsignor Quinn would not be the borough's first saint if canonized. The Orthodox Church in America canonized Rafla Hawaweeny as St. Raphael of Brooklyn in 2000."

He graduated from Hurricane High School in West Virginia, after which he attended Greenbriar Military School in Lewisberg, WV. He received his appointment to the United States Military Academy, West Point, NY in 1939 and was graduated early, January 1943, due to the War. His initial assignment was with the 385th Fighter Group as a P-47 pilot, flying bomber support leading up to and including D-Day and later flying support for Gen. Patton's drive through France. By the end of the War, he had flown 114 combat missions and was commander of the 367th Fighter Squadron. Following the war, he served many in capacities organizing and commanding various fighter and bomber squadrons within the Strategic Air Command. In 1964 he was assigned to Washington, D.C., serving as deputy director of operational requirements in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Research and Development, where he worked on conceptual plans for the B-1, F-15, A-10, and advanced versions of intercontinental ballistic missiles. In 1968 he served as Vice Commander of the Space and Missile Systems Organization and in 1970 the Commander of the Space and Missile Test Center in Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.

Lesser known was the evacuation of over 2000 orphaned children, known as Operation Baby Lift, to new adoptive parents in the U.S. During his very distinguished career he had the opportunity to travel the globe and meet dignitaries of many countries. His favorites were Bob Hope and Jane Mansfield, whom he entertained on one of their USO tours. After 35 years of military service, he retired May 31, 1977 to a small ranch in Tucson, AZ where he was able to fulfill his childhood dream of raising horses and cattle. He has been very active in his community, loving the sun, the warmth, his family and his many friends that surround him. Louis L.

But Ms. Fishko really grabbed my attention when she mentioned the somewhat remarkable fact that the song's melody consists of only six notes. (Bonus: It's written in the key of A minor, which means no sharps or flats.) As a not-so-talented pianist, this was too tempting to pass up.

But most of the concert takes place out of sight of the camera in this film from Ang Lee, which focuses instead on the transformative effects of that landmark event on an assortment of people. In the forefront is Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin, above), an interior decorator living in Greenwich Village, on whose memoir the film is based. Elliot returns to the Catskills to help his parents (Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton), Jews who immigrated from Russia, keep their failing motel afloat. He also paves the way for Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy), the owner of the dairy farm where the festival was held, and Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff), its primary creator, to strike a deal. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said: ''For all its sincerity, 'Taking Woodstock' lacks the passion of Mr. Lee's finest films, 'Brokeback Mountain,' 'Lust, Caution,' 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and 'The Ice Storm.' I would add, however, that given a subject that has become synonymous with overblown mythmaking, its modesty becomes it.'' 10:30 A.M.

2010-07-04T00:00:00Z,"OWEN--Jane Blaffer 1915 - 2010. Jane Blaffer Owen CBE, of Houston, was the daughter of Robert Lee Blaffer and Sarah Campbell Blaffer and wife of Kenneth Dale Owen, a descendant of Robert Owen. Her father helped start Exxon and on her mother's side, the former Texaco. She was the proud mother of three daughters; Jane Dale Owen, Caroline Campbell Owen Coleman and Anne Dale Owen-Pontez. She attended the very first Kinkaid School. She graduated from the Ethel Walker School in Connecticut. She studied at Bryn Mawr, The Washington School of Diplomacy and The Union Theological Seminary in New York, and later, studied under the late Theologian Paul Tillich. She once commented, ""To whom much is given, much is expected,"" ""People don't understand generosity...to give is to receive."" Armed with her gifts, extraordinary intelligence, grace, charm and her own innate sense of style, she began her quest. This free spirit with an untethered generosity turned her sights on New Harmony, IN. She married Kenneth Owen in 1941 and he introduced her for the first time to his New Harmony birth place, a faded town on the Wabash that once held the dreams of generations past. It was founded as a utopian society in the hopes of creating ""a community of equality."" New Harmony became her pallet and unfettered she set about to preserve its history, restore its homes and bring some of the greatest minds and artists to its door. With renewed dreams, she had hopes for a better world for all humanity. Of course she did it with a dash of her own verve. With passion for people from all walks of life; she provided an atmosphere of vitality and acceptance. With her charm, vision, and insatiable drive she tried to create a more interdependent world. It began in 1958, when she started the R.L. Blaffer Foundation to preserve and promote the historical and educational attributes of New Harmony. She commissioned Philip Johnson to build The Roofless Church where one could see the sky and embrace people of all faiths while aspiring towards a more united and peaceful world. Jacques Lipchitz fashioned the bronze Madonna and Child at its center. She created a park for Theologian Paul Tillich in a wooded glade to cherish his desire that his ashes be scattered in New Harmony. She convinced The Eli Lilly Foundation to build an athenaeum as a visitor center in New Harmony. Richard Meyer was her choice. Steven de Staebler was prodded to produce three granite pieces to set in the wheat fields, ""The Pieta, Angel Gabriel and The Vision on St. Benedict."" She encouraged Jeff Sparks from Indianapolis to start the Heartland Film Festival in Indianapolis, Kent Schuette, Purdue architectural school, to replicate the ancient labyrinth from the Chartres Cathedral. Frances Lepaux, Cannon of the Cathedral of Chartres dedicated Labyrinth for meditation, and prayer. Imminent British sculptor Simon Verity created the Fountain of Orpheus placed at its apex. She was awarded the prestigious Louise DuPont Crown Shield Award, The National Preservation's highest accolade and honored by The National Trust for Historic Preservation. She received The Sachem Award from Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels to recognize a lifetime of excellence and virtue she shared this inaugural award with college coaching legend John Wooden and Rev. Theodore Hesburgh CSC, President Emeritus of the University of Norte Dame. With all her acclaim she lived a modest simple life; she was often seen in her hat and golf cart chauffeuring visitors and guests around New Harmony. In Houston she was a major supporter of Blaffer Gallery and University of Houston's G. Hines College of Architecture. She was honored for her lifetime support of the arts and architecture. She and Dean Joe Mashurn, collaborated with Ben Nicholson, CAI, and a class of University of Houston architecture students to build Frederick Kiesler's lifelong wish to realize ""The Grotto for Meditation,"" now standing at the University of Houston. She founded the English Speaking Union, she was the first president of the Allied Arts Council, a founder of the International Seaman's Center of Houston, Trustee of C.G. Jung Educational Center, Sustaining Trustee of the Univeristy of Houston Moores School of Music. Served on the board of The Houston Symphony and The Contemporary Arts Association. She holds Honorary Doctorates of Arts and Humanities from USI, Kenyon College, Ball State University, Butler Theological Seminary and Purdue University Doctor of Letters. She was one of two persons in Texas to have received Commander of The British Empire, bestowed by her majesty, Queen Elizabeth II. It was befitting that Jane Owen's heart should stop on the longest and brightest day of the year at her home in Houston surrounded by family. She will be greatly missed by her family and many, many friends. No one will forget her joy of life, boundless energy and her positive attitude that gave us such hope and a belief that all things are possible and that miracles can happen. Jane is survived by her sister, Joyce von Bothmer of New York; daughters: Jane D. Owen of Palm Beach, Anne D. Owen-Pontez of Houston and husband Hal Pontez; devoted grandchildren: Erik O. Arneberg, Ingrid A. Grados, James O. Coleman and Abigail Owen-Pontez; and Great-Grandchildren: Sarah Grados and Jane Owen-Coleman. The memorial service is to be conducted at half-past ten o'clock in the morning on Saturday, the 10th of July, at St. Martin's Episcopal Church, 717 Sage Road in Houston, where the Rev. Dr. Russell J. Levenson, Jr., Rector, and the Very Rev. J. Pittman McGehee, former Dean of Christ Church Cathedral, are to officiate.

For decades the small seaside neighborhood on the northwest coast of Napier, New Zealand, was dominated by its wharf, cavernous warehouses left empty as the wool industry declined, and rough-and-tumble pubs frequented by local dock workers. But in 2000, with the demolition of a vacant building and the construction of an apartment block, the area started to turn. A row of those wool warehouses on the quay was converted into bars and restaurants that these days heave with 20- and 30-something revelers on warm nights. KIRSTEN MATTHEW"

2010-07-04T00:00:00Z,"AS a cinema enthusiast who grew up enamored of directors from Nicholas Roeg to George Lucas, Christopher Nolan said, ''I'm mindful of the great filmmakers I carry with me.'' That mélange of influences manifests itself in many ways in ''Inception.'' But as with any dream, who's to say exactly where it came from? ''Who knows?'' Mr. Nolan said. ''These things aren't always conscious. Sometimes these things are suggested to you, and afterwards you go: 'Oh, yeah. Maybe he's got a point.' I try not to be conscious in my influences. I try and just do what feels right.'' Here, at least, are a few of the filmmakers he knowingly drew upon for ''Inception.'' DAVE ITZKOFF Stanley Kubrick The influence of the director of ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' above with Keir Dullea, is readily apparent in a ''dream-gravity'' sequence during ''Inception'' that tracks Joseph Gordon-Levitt through an environment of rotating rooms followed by a period of total weightlessness. ''Kubrick to me always had a wonderful sense of calm and specificity in everything he did,'' Mr. Nolan said. ''Every detail had a specific meaning and purpose. That's something I always try to aim for in my filmmaking. It's not a specific thing. It's an approach of saying: 'Why is this thing here? What are we doing with this detail, this element?''' Ridley Scott Mr. Nolan spoke admiringly of Mr. Scott's science-fiction thriller ''Alien,'' which he said is most memorable not for its chestbursting shock scenes but for ''the naturalism of it that was shocking at the time.'' He added: ''It's like Ken Loach in outer space. Hand-held camera, overlapping dialogue, bickering and incredibly naturalistic performances. That's the bit that everybody forgets.'' Also, he said, ''you couldn't really aim higher than his work in 'Blade Runner,'''-- above, with Harrison Ford -- ''in terms of putting the audience into an alternate reality and allowing them to experience a different world for a couple of hours.''"

He is survived by his children Starr Oxenberg, Robert Oxenberg, Catherine Van Dien and husband Casper, Christina Oxenberg, Ashley Harcourt and husband Scott, and grandchildren, Mari, Luna, India, Celest and Maya, and one great-grandchild, Magnolia. Born in New York, Howard always knew he was destined for a rich and colorful life. He had natural movie star good looks and a shrewd mind. He started off in life without much but with tremendous courage to overcome any obstacle. He taught himself to become a champion swimmer and was a member of the Aquacade. His athleticism earned him a college scholarship and also saved him from the front lines of battle in WWII as he was assigned by the Navy to teach hundreds of sailors how to swim. Howard created many successful ladies clothing lines and was the first to mass market maternity dresses. He sold his businesses at age 50 and retired to the good life. He taught himself to ski and play tennis and was soon dominating both sports with his grace and agility and refusal to ever be second best. Howard owned homes in New York City, Southampton, and Palm Beach and devoted himself to a social circuit of fine friends, parties, back-gammon, and traveling. Anyone who knew Howard knew he was the life of the party with his wide smile and easy laugh and desire to cheer. He lived a life quite unique and as he said so often, ""I'm one in a million.""

Last year at a Nets game at the Izod Center, I went to buy sausages while my son, Jack, headed for the beer counter. Jack, who is in his early 40s and starting to gray, soon joined me in the sausage line, explaining his wallet was in the car and he couldn't buy beer without an ID. After we got our food, I went to the beer line, showed my ID and left with two drafts.

At the same time, a rather more sober exploration by Somers was on display in Hornu, Belgium, at Grand Hornu Images, as part of the exhibition ''In Progress,'' which asks 10 design firms to rethink the idea of progress. (The exhibition runs through Sept. 12.) Somers chose to create three still-life vignettes made of human ashes. Yes, human ashes. In her statement for the exhibition, Somers questions peoples' seemingly unquenchable thirst to consume, and proposes that they might in turn become some of the objects they love to buy, thereby creatively upcycling some of the 465,000 liters of human ashes that are produced each day. With the technological miracle of 3-D printing, Somers says, ''we may offer Grandpa a second life as a useful rocking chair or even as a vacuum cleaner or a toaster.

The shop, in Sodermalm, the city's answer to Brooklyn and the only party of town that could be called gritty, is outfitted almost entirely in unfinished knotty pine boards; they line the walls and form blocky benches and tables for merchandise that includes Mr. Freedom work shirts, Quoddy moccasins, Pendleton blankets and Wesco motorcycle boots. And true to the cult of craftsmanship, the narrative behind every company the store does business with is highlighted on its Web site. The expertly focused selection of brands includes plenty of international origin - canvas satchels from Brady Bags of England, founded in 1877; Grunden rain gear (Sweden, 1926); jeans by The Real McCoy's (Japan, 1990) - but the effect is nonetheless a mashup of styles that feels unmistakably American. Easy rider meets California gold miner meets New England stevedore, all crammed into your dad's tool shed, circa 1976. This is a more complete of the story than the one that appeared in print."

To try a more positive tack: Mr. Wright, perhaps you could address how you see gay experiences as being inflected by race and class, and why you chose to write about the subset of the gay youth population that your title implies?"

2010-07-04T00:00:00Z,"Thanks to Jeroen Koolhaas and Dre Urhahn, one of Rio's bleakest neighborhoods now has a permanent rainbow. As part of their project ''O Morro'' (which literally translated means ''the hill'' but really signifies the presence of ''the slum''), the Dutch artists have enlisted the community to transform the facades of 34 houses (about 7,000 square meters!) into a colorful community art project. Local residents who picked up a brush received a small salary (the painting took about a month) and an education in the production process. Koolhaas and Urhahn, who have been painting favelas for the past two years as part of a greater initiative to transform the hillside slums into places that residents are proud to live in, plan to return to Brazil to finish painting the entire hill.

2010-07-04T00:00:00Z,"Several years ago, Dr. David Rowlands, a senior lecturer with the Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health at Massey University in New Zealand, set out to study the role of protein in recovery from hard exercise. He asked a group of male cyclists to ride intensely until their legs were aching and virtually all of their stored muscle fuel had been depleted. The cyclists then consumed bars and drinks that contained either mostly carbohydrates or both carbohydrates and protein. Then, over the next few days, they completed two sessions of hard intervals. One took place the following morning; the next, two days later. Dr. Rowlands found that the cyclists showed little benefit during the first interval session. But during the second, the men who ingested protein had an overall performance gain of more than 4 percent, compared with the men who took only carbohydrates, ''which is huge, in competitive terms,'' Dr. Rowlands says. Other researchers' earlier studies produced similar results. Protein seems to aid in the uptake of carbohydrates from the blood; muscles pack in more fuel after exercise if those calories are accompanied by protein. The protein is also thought to aid in the repair of muscle damage after hard exercise. Dr. Rowlands's work, which was published in 2008, was right in line with conventional wisdom."

The Netherlands, famed for decades for elegant play, reached consecutive finals in 1974 and 1978 but has never won the Cup.

Brash and bawdy, Kim has a lot to say and knows how to tell a story. She also brings some of her famous golfer friends along for the ride. Kim does not carefully dance around any subject, she charges right in - as anyone who has seen her play, or dress, would expect. But some of the best parts are the subtle things, like the tedium and pressure of a job so rife with failure. Here is Kim driving for six hours from a Rhode Island charity event to a L.P.G.A. tournament in Rochester, N.Y., and trying to get there early because she didn't yet have a caddie to carry her bag for the competition."

When the Apple TV was unveiled a few months later in early 2007, Mr. Jobs reiterated these comments in an interview with USA Today:We've got two strong legs on our chair today - we have the Mac business, which is a $10 billion business, and music, our iPod and iTunes business, which is $10 billion. We hope the iPhone is the third leg on our chair, and maybe one day Apple TV will be the fourth leg.Yet it wasn't long before Apple downgraded its hopes of a living room accessory and fourth leg to its business, and Mr. Jobs started referring to the poor Apple TV as a ''hobby.''"

2010-07-06T16:40:33Z,"My column on Monday made a disparaging reference to Jimmy Carter's famous ""malaise"" speech (in which, yes, he never actually used the word ""malaise""), citing it as an example of the pessimism bubble that inflated in late-1970s America. Recently a narrative has sprung up, on the ""crunchy"" right as well as on the left, that argues that Carter was prescient rather than over-pessimistic, and that America would be better off today if we'd heeded his indictment of consumerism and self-indulgence, rather than spurning him for the go-go optimism of Ronald Reagan. This is not a crazy idea, since in many ways the speech's moral critique of American life was powerful, timely, and as applicable today as it was then. (Here's a snippet: ""In a nation that was proud of hard work, strong families, close-knit communities, and our faith in God, too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption. Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns."") You can debate whether it's appropriate for a chief executive to play the prophet, but if Carter had stopped talking halfway through the address, confined himself to calling for moral renewal, and stayed away from economic policy, the ""malaise"" speech would look like a plausible indictment of the excesses of late-modern America - excesses that are very much still with us today, and contributed in varying ways to our current economic dislocations."

Some of the products, like the pretty Claus Porto soaps, are more popular, while the Bordalo Pinheiro ceramics are harder to come by.

2010-07-06T00:00:00Z,"NEMET--Tom, who died on July 4, 2010, lived the American Dream. He built a successful car dealership, he helped defeat proposed legislation that would have crippled the imported auto industry, and he enjoyed a full life with his immediate and extended family. To these three passions that animated his life, he brought grace and dignity. Founded nearly a century ago, Nemet Motors developed under Tom's leadership to become The Nemet Auto Group. Tom had a simple philosophy for selling cars: Treat your customers with respect, give them a good deal, and stand by them when in need. He served over 11,000 customers a year, but never let a day go by without thinking about how he could continue to grow the business. He knew that the Nation's Capital could have a profound impact, for good and for bad, in the life of a dealer. He lobbied Presidents, Senators, and Representatives, always sharing the same message: Because competition is the lifeblood of the nation, the best laws and regulations must be built on the foundation of free trade. In making the case for his industry, he never failed to remind politicians that his business was built around the porters, the mechanics, the sales personnel, and the others in the dealership whose livelihood depended on his ability to compete fairly. He founded Auto Dealers and Drivers for Free Trade as a means of providing financial support to Members of Congress who shared his vision. In the early years, before Honda, Nissan, and Toyota were household names, Tom worked with others in the industry to block proposed legislation and regulations that would have kept lower-priced cars and trucks beyond the reach of ordinary consumers. He fought hard as well to make sure that banks and other lenders would offer reasonable credit terms, so that a car or a truck would never be beyond the reach of someone who worked hard every day. But beyond his many accomplishments in building a business and helping the imported auto industry prosper, nothing mattered more in Tom's life than his family. He worked to bring family members into the business or to pursue their own dreams. He was passionate about his extended family as well. Conversations with colleagues never ended without him asking about their sons and daughters, and their jobs, their schoolwork, their aspirations. With his family by his side, Tom Nemet lost an 18-month battle with cancer on Sunday. He is survived by his loving wife Mary, sons Kyle, Todd, Ross and daughter Robyn and son in law Scott, and daughter in law Suzanne. Loving grandfather of Harrison, Jordan, Joshua, Matthew, and Rachel. Funeral to be held Wednesday, July 7th 2010 at 12pm at Schwartz Brothers-Jeffer Memorial Chapel 114-03 Queens Boulevard, Forest Hills, New York 11375 (718) 363-7600.

On the other side are white owners with bills of sale who believe they should not be made to pay individually for the collective crimes of apartheid.

The story goes that when Cruyff received the ball with two men on him the youth coach would tell him to pass off to other players. Cruyff had his own ideas about the game so often he would take on and beat the first, then the second and maybe a third defender, with the coach yelling at him the entire time to pass the ball."

2010-07-06T00:00:00Z,"World Cup Semifinal: Uruguay vs. Netherlands2:30 p.m. EasternTV: ESPN, UnivisionTwo teams with deep World Cup traditions meet in a semifinal in Cape Town. Uruguay has won the tournament twice - in 1930 and 1950 - but has not reached this stage in 40 years. The Netherlands, famed for decades for elegant play, reached consecutive finals in 1974 and 1978 but has never won the Cup. Diego Forlan and Luis Suarez have led Uruguay with three goals each, but Suarez is unavailable for this match; his intentional goal-line handball - cynical or brilliant, depending on your view - saved his team in the dying seconds of regulation time against Ghana but earned him a red card and a one-game suspension. The gritty play of Mark van Bommel in the Netherlands' midfield gives Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder the freedom to attack. Sneijder, an eagle-eyed playmaker, has scored four goals. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2010-07-07T13:15:45Z,"The producers of ""Weeds"" have been a bit ambiguous about where exactly Nancy Botwin, the drug-dealing mom played by Mary-Louise Parker, and her family will be fleeing for the show's coming sixth season. Could one of their destinations be a sleepy Northeastern resort town still haunted by a toothless old shark who chewed up its tourists in 1975? Maybe, maybe not, but either way, Richard Dreyfuss - who's really making the most of the 35th anniversary of his starring role in ""Jaws"" - will be joining the ""Weeds"" ensemble for at least four episodes of Season 6, press representatives for the Showtime comedy said on Wednesday. A news release described the character played by Mr. Dreyfuss (whose film credits also include ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""American Graffiti"" and ""The Goodbye Girl"") as ""an unexpected character from Nancy's past."" The new season of ""Weeds,"" which has its debut on Aug. 16, will also feature as guest stars Alanis Morissette and Jennifer Jason Leigh, as well as Linda Hamilton, Peter Stormare and Mark-Paul Gosselaar, but not the show's co-star Elizabeth Perkins, who previously announced she was leaving the series."

He makes the essential point, which is that this incident reflects badly on Kagan, worse on the ACOG - but worst of all on the various judges who then assumed, in decision after decision, that the ACOG statement could be treated as The Scientific Answer to the partial-birth abortion question, pure and undefiled by any crass political considerations. ""This is the scandal's real lesson,"" Saletan writes. ""Judges should stop treating the statements of scientific organizations as apolitical. Such statements, like the statements of any other group, can be loaded with spin ...  All of us should be embarrassed that a sentence written by a White House aide now stands enshrined in the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court, erroneously credited with scientific authorship and rigor."""
2010-07-07T13:04:58Z,"""Seven years ago, the sociologists Kei Nomaguchi and Melissa A. Milkie did a study in which they followed couples for five to seven years, some of whom had children and some of whom did not. And what they found was that, yes, those couples who became parents did more housework and felt less in control and quarreled more (actually, only the women thought they quarreled more, but anyway). On the other hand, the married women were less depressed after they'd had kids than their childless peers. And perhaps this is because the study sought to understand not just the moment-to-moment moods of its participants, but more existential matters, like how connected they felt, and how motivated, and how much despair they were in (as opposed to how much stress they were under): Do you not feel like eating? Do you feel like you can't shake the blues? Do you feel lonely? Like you can't get going? Parents, who live in a clamorous, perpetual-forward-motion machine almost all of the time, seemed to have different answers than their childless cohorts."""

Born in Brooklyn on Avenue M in 1924, Arthur was a graduate of Lawrenceville School, Yale University '45W, and Columbia Law School. During WWII, he served in the US Navy aboard a Destroyer Escort in the North Atlantic. An ardent sailor, Arthur was a member of the New York Yacht Club and the American Yacht Club. With his ocean racing sloop ""Artemis"", he competed in many off shore and distance races such as the Admiral's Cup and the SORC.

Known for his philanthropic efforts, Arthur was a member of the Executive Committee of Montefiore Medical Center, and served as president of the American Federation of the Arts, co-chairman of the board of trustees of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and on numerous other philanthropic boards. Arthur practiced law for 60 years, specializing in providing counsel to remarkable entrepreneurs and their ventures. In some instances he joined his clients in their projects, including a collaboration with the legendary restaurateur Joe Baum in which the Baum and Emil families operated the Rainbow Room and Windows on the World. Arthur was a visionary real estate developer whose projects included the conversion of the Police Building in lower Manhattan, the restoration of the Guaranty Building in Buffalo, and the development of Harbor Plaza in Stamford. Arthur's greatest commitment in life was to his family. His first wife, Jane Allen Emil, with whom he had three children, died in 1973.

His friends at The Atlantic Philanthropies mourn the loss of a towering pioneer who did so much to make the world recognize what may be the most important development of the last century: the transformation of human longevity. More than 30 years ago, he won the Pulitzer Prize for his book, ""Why Survive? Being Old in America."" He was the first head of the National Institute of Aging. He founded the first department of geriatrics in the country. He identified and indelibly labeled the social malady of ""ageism."" He created, built and grew the International Longevity Center which now has offices in 12 countries, an achievement that The Atlantic Philanthropies has been pleased to support over many years. Throughout, Bob worked ceaselessly to teach the public to reject the crude canard of ""greedy geezers"" and recognize that for the most part, older adults are not dependent, lusting for handouts, but independent, eager to give back to society. As he wrote 40 years ago, ""Older people are as diverse as people in other periods of life, and their patterns of aging vary according to the range they show from health to sickness, from maturity to immaturity, activity to apathy, useful constructive participation to disinterest, from the prevailing stereotype of aging to rich forms of creativity.""

2010-07-07T00:00:00Z,"Poised as we are for the most comprehensive financial reform in this country since the Great Depression, it is time to fess up to the fact that it likely would not have occurred without a concerted effort by the Obama administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress to demonize Goldman Sachs. There are good reasons, of course, why politicians have seized on Goldman for easy political gain. Among them are: the perceptions that Goldman figured out a way to benefit from the misery of others; that while many Americans were hurting from a recession partly of Goldman's making, the firm continued to rake in billions in profits and pay out billions more in bonuses; that Goldman seems unable to recognize that but for an 11th-hour rescue by the American taxpayers, in September 2008, it would have gone the way of Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch; and that Goldman has proved repeatedly that it prefers putting its own interests ahead of those of its prized clients and the rest of us. Another likely reason is that the politicians simply looked at the recent public polling data, which put Goldman's reputation below that of BP and Toyota, and realized that nothing spells political gold these days quite like bashing Goldman Sachs."

He was born in Gavle, Sweden, on August 26, 1920. He pursued his medical studies at the University of Uppsala, where he met and married Ingeborg Agnes Hellner, a law student, in 1943. A Freudian, he underwent analytic training in Sweden and with Erik Erikson in Stockbridge, Massachusetts from 1958 to 1960. Upon his return to Sweden, he became president of the Swedish Psychoanalytic Association and hosted the International Psychoanalytic Congress in Stockholm in 1963. In 1964, he returned with his family to Stockbridge to join the staff at the Austen Riggs Center. He served as Associate Clinical Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine from 1968 to 1973. He was associated with the Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco from 1969 to 1972 and after that was Associate Professor of Psychiatry at UCLA and the Brentwood VA Hospital from 1972 to 1976, when he entered private practice. He and his wife retired to Oregon in 1984. There, he served on the board of directors of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and the Rogue Valley Symphony Orchestra, for whom he was a tireless fundraiser. They returned to Sweden in 1996. Dr. Lofgren was an early leader of Group Relations conferences as practiced by the Tavistock Institute in both the United States and Sweden. He was a founding member of GREX in San Francisco, SCOLA in Los Angeles, and AGSLO in Sweden, all organizations devoted to this approach of studying group and organizational dynamics from a psychoanalytic perspective. In addition, he wrote extensively on a number of psychoanalytic topics for The Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association and The International Journal of Psychoanalysis. Dr. Lofgren will be remembered by many whose lives he touched throughout his long life as a superb healer, teacher, and mentor; a lover of jokes, good food, good wine, and music; and a loyal friend. He and Ingeborg, who died in 2007, were extraordinarily devoted to each other during their 64-year marriage; they rarely spent time apart and shared a deep love of both nature and the fine arts. He is survived by his three children, Sten B. Lofgren of Concord, Massachusetts and his domestic partner Sally Lopez, Hans B. Lofgren and his wife Tijana of Pixbo, Sweden, and Lotta M. Lofgren of Charlottesville, Virginia, as well as six grandchildren. Lars was a formidable force in the lives of all who knew him; he will be missed by all.

2010-07-08T13:10:55Z,"""In the Gospels Jesus is always talking to the crowds in parables, which he later 'explains' to his disciples. The dynamic is odd in a couple of ways: either the parables are obvious, and the explanations seem almost patronizing, or they are opaque, and the explanations only compound their opacity. (Or could it be-and I confess to relishing this possibility-that the explanations illustrate Christ's wry sense of humor, which is nowhere else evident?) In any case, the notable point is just how little the explanations amount to, how completely the ultimate truths of the parables-just like dreams and poems-remain within their own occurrence ... 'If that's what he means,' says the student to the poetry teacher, 'why doesn't he just say it?' 'If God is real,' says the parishioner to the preacher, 'why doesn't he simply storm into our lives and convince us?' The questions are vastly different in scale and relative importance, but their answers are similar. A poem, if it's a real one, in some fundamental sense means no more and no less than the moment of its singular music and lightning insight; it is its own code to its own absolute and irreducible clarity. A god, if it's a living one, is not outside of reality but in it, of it (though in ways it takes patience and imagination to perceive). Thus the uses and necessities of metaphor, which can flash us past our plodding resistance and habits into strange new truths. Thus the very practical effects of music, myth, image, which tease us not out of reality but deeper and more completely into it."""

A scratch golfer, Mrs. Diebold particularly enjoyed playing the game at the Washington Club with her mother, when both were well along in years. She was a member of the Red Cross Ambulance Corps in New York City during World War II and followed her husband to Washington, DC, when he served in the U.S. Army there during the conflict. She was a great supporter of many charitable causes in Florida, Connecticut, and elsewhere, including the Roxbury Land Trust, The Christian Herald Association, Roxbury and Boca Grande Fire, Ambulance, Library and Churches and many, many others. Known as a formidable grande dame and arbiter of social correctness, Mrs. Diebold was also an amazingly gracious hostess and supremely generous and thoughtful friend, who appreciated the special essence of everyone she met. She taught her grandchildren to call her Mumsie and somewhere along the line, everyone started calling her Mumsie. Mumsie will be eulogized on Friday, July 9, 2010 at 11am, Christ Church Roxbury, CT and all who loved her are welcome. Burial will be private. In lieu of flowers, please consider making a memorial contribution to Christ Church, Roxbury or the Roxbury Volunteer Fire Department."

2010-07-08T00:00:00Z,"SWEELEY--Michael M.,died on June 30 at the age of 85 after a long illness. Born in Twin Falls, Idaho, he was descended from early Western settlers. He attended UC Berkley for a short time and then served in the army in WWII. A lifelong love of music sent him to Juilliard after the war, where he received a BS and MS in music criticism in 1949. His gift for writing and knowledge of music brought him assignments in the field of music publicity and development. After acting as tour manager for Maryla Jonas, the polish pianist, on her last transcontinental tour, he went to work for the impresario Sol Hurok. Michael managed public relations for many of the major classical artists and international touring companies represented by Hurok, including, The Royal Ballet, The Old Vic, The D'Oyly Carte Opera Co., The Kirov Ballet, and La Comedie Francaise. In 1955, Lucie Bigelow Rosen, wishing to expand the Caramoor Music Festival in Katonah, NY into a professional undertaking, borrowed Michael from the Hurok office. Michael became Executive Director and worked with Mrs. Rosen in this endeavor until her death in 1968, at which time he left the Hurok office and devoted his full time to developing Walter and Lucie Rosen's dream of making their home at Caramoor into a Center for Music and the Arts. The summer music festival was expanded from four weekends to nine weeks of classical orchestral concerts, opera, dance, chamber music, recital, etc. The Rosen House, with its collection of fine and decorative arts, along with the gardens, was opened to the public. Educational programs were begun. Michael remained the Executive Director of Caramoor for more than thirty years and helped develop it into a major international arts institution. When Michael retired from Caramoor, he pursued his love of travel for some years. Predeceased by his father, Judge Everett M. Sweeley, his mother, Hazel Browne Sweeley, and his devoted sisters, Jean B. Sweeley and Anna L. Sweeley, there are no immediate survivors. Burial will be with his family in Twin Falls, Idaho."

And we trust that they will at least pretend. We trust that they will recognize the ultimate ludicrousness of this whole enterprise, that these are grown men wearing tank tops, throwing a ball up and around, running on wood, that this all exists because we allow it to exist, that the illusion must be maintained. We trust that they understand how good they have it, how much we give them, against our own self-interest. We trust that they are not laughing at us. That trust felt broken tonight. Not because LeBron James went to the Heat, even though he referred to his destination as 'South Beach,' not 'the Miami Heat and their fans.' Not because LeBron James didn't go to the Knicks, even though of all the cities he mentioned enjoying during this free agent 'courtship,' New York was the one he omitted. Not even because LeBron was so, so cruel to Cleveland, not once thanking the fans who made him into what he was ... No, tonight, it felt like everyone involved - LeBron, ESPN, Bing, the University of Phoenix, Stuart Scott, the man who once chastised fans for having the audacity to boo, Jim freaking Gray - treated the millions of people watching like stupid, mindless consumers, empty lemmings ready to follow Sport into the abyss ... It felt like a break, the moment when the tide crested, when we looked at the games, and their players, and ourselves, and wondered: Why in the world are we watching these awful people?"""

Active and vigorous throughout his life, Arthur had joined a new law firm just after his 85th birthday, played in a golf tournament with his daughter and sister three weeks ago, and spent the weekend before his death surrounded by family at his home in Rye, New York. Born in Brooklyn on Avenue M in 1924, Arthur was a graduate of Lawrenceville School, Yale University '45W, and Columbia Law School. During WWII, he served in the US Navy aboard a Destroyer Escort in the North Atlantic. An ardent sailor, Arthur was a member of the New York Yacht Club and the American Yacht Club. With his ocean racing sloop ""Artemis"", he competed in many off shore and distance races such as the Admiral's Cup and the SORC. In his younger days, Arthur had a single digit handicap in golf; he was an enthusiastic member of the Century Country Club. Known for his philanthropic efforts, Arthur was a member of the Executive Committee of Montefiore Medical Center, and served as president of the American Federation of the Arts, co-chairman of the board of trustees of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and on numerous other philanthropic boards. Arthur practiced law for 60 years, specializing in providing counsel to remarkable entrepreneurs and their ventures.

Arthur was a visionary real estate developer whose projects included the conversion of the Police Building in lower Manhattan, the restoration of the Guaranty Building in Buffalo, and the development of Harbor Plaza in Stamford.

(BBC America) THE GREAT FOOTBALL GIVEAWAY In 2000 Paul Clarke, an advertising executive, and his wife, Sarah, were visiting Malawi on a holiday when they noticed children playing with makeshift soccer balls made of layers of plastic bags bound together with string. The Clarkes vowed to return with real soccer balls. Since founding their charity, the Great Football Giveaway, in 2006, they have hand-delivered tens of thousands of soccer balls to impoverished children in Malawi, Uganda, Angola, Rwanda and Congo. This documentary tells the couple's story while celebrating the joy found in the simple act of kicking a ball around. ''I accepted that I'm not a doctor who can administer anti-retroviral drugs, I can't build wells and I'm not an engineer,'' Mr. Clarke has said of his endeavors. ''But I could find a way to help put smiles on kids' faces'' -- and perhaps save lives at the same time. With the help of the Clarkes' charity, a soccer program is being used to help rehabilitate child soldiers in Congo. 7 P.M. (National Geographic) NAT GEO AMAZING!

Players like Joey Votto, Kevin Youkilis and Jered Weaver were initially left off their leagues' rosters, and curious alternatives like Omar Infante, Ryan Howard and Ty Wigginton made the teams. Some of this debate stems from the bizarre edict from the major league office that a 35-man roster must have a utility player. (My preferred option would be to name two or three emergency players and allow them to enter the game only in case of an injury or extra innings.)

But in the wave of postwar urban renewal, the city embarked on a wave of consolidation, trading its diversity for a monoculture based on stark octagonal aluminum poles anchored to the ground by plain boxes. Fortunately, a few of the old lampposts survived, and in recent years they've been joined by a small army of newly cast replicas. In addition, the Department of Transportation continues to commission new designs; recently, it introduced a sleek and shiny model in Downtown Brooklyn. As the city's lamppost culture comes back to life, it's worth taking a look at some of the iconic forms that illuminated New York's past. 1. Fulton, Fulton Mall, Brooklyn"

To take advantage of Mint.com's money tracking services, you need to enter your bank account user names and passwords so Mint.com can keep track of how much you're spending and saving.

As the guitars shrilled, he began to smear red paint violently across his face. He then lofted a bottle of pancake syrup over his head and poured it down his body, squirting it into his ears. Next, he stuck Monopoly money to the ooze, and capped off the performance by sucking down a whole mango. The audience cheered. It was a typical evening, guests said, at the house-turned-concert space on Wyckoff Avenue known as Silent Barn."

Considered the founding father of ""age group running"" for youth in the United States, Mr. Geisler, a father of six, began coaching his children in 1963. His sons were accomplished age group runners, including his oldest son, Barry, who ran a marathon in 3:17 at age 12. The gratification he received running with and teaching his children led him to work with other children who wanted to run. Mr. Geisler started children's age group cross country races in 1964 for boys and girls. At that time there were no middle distance races for girls in the country. In 1966 he started the first national age group cross-country championship in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx which became the premiere running event for children for decades. Barry was an early member of the New York Road Runners Club and was its President in 1971-72 and founder of its Age Group Program. His greatest running achievement was as founder and coach of the Millrose Athletic Association's Age Group Track Team from 1980-1995. In the 1980's the children won more major individual and team awards than any other team in the nation. He was the coach of All American champions Nnenna and Shola Lynch. A proud son of the Bronx, Barry was the first child of Else Kunze and Arthur Geisler. He was born on December 25, 1932. Nine children followed. He served with the 101st Airborne Division in the Korean War. Barry worked in meat distribution and packing for more than forty years. He retired as a shop steward with Amalgamated Butchers Wholesale Local 174 in the Bronx at Hunts Point. Coach Geisler is survived by his wife Lisa and his children, Barry, Jr., Yonkers, NY; Eric, Nanuet, NY; Lee, Sarasota, FL; Ronald, Poughkeepsie, NY; Gina Daley, Pleasant Valey, NY; Jessica Toreno, Spokane, WA; 17 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. He also is survived by his siblings Beverly Traver, Elizabeth Hogan, Judith Hornbeck, Joseph Conrad, and Daniel, Kenneth and Leonard Geisler. Services were held on Friday, July 9th at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel in New York City. Burial followed at Roosevelt Memorial Park in Trevose, PA. Shiva will be held at the residence.

As far as I could see across the dry, scorched lawn, purslane was the only plant thriving in the brutal summer heat. Purslane sprawls low to the ground on thick red stems that radiate out from its center, resembling a wee jade plant. When I first started reading about this amazingly tenacious edible, I confused it with all sorts of common ground cover, like sedum. But after discovering patches of it growing in cracks in the sidewalks in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and in friends' backyards, I now find its meandering magenta-colored stems and flat paddle-shaped leaves unmistakable."

It has since become one of Shiseido's best sellers. And, according to Mr. Page, anyone can wear it. ''Once you get into color like this, it becomes like an accessory,'' he said.

Dorothy Orizondo Roosen Diebold, age 105, went to meet her Heavenly Father at her beloved home, Toplands Farm, in Roxbury, CT on Tuesday, July 6, 2010. She was preceded in death by her husband, Albert Richard Diebold, mother Clarita Orizondo Roosen, father Herman Dudley Roosen, sisters Clarita Roosen and Helen Roosen Curran, brothers Berend Roosen and Robert Roosen, and grandson Albert Richard Diebold III. Long a fixture of New York City, Palm Beach, Boca Grande, Florida, and Roxbury, Connecticut, Mrs. Diebold is survived by her children Albert Richard Diebold, Diane Diebold Terni, and Dudley George Diebold and wife Honoria Hine Diebold; her grandchildren Deborah Diebold de Naveja and husband Juan-Maria Naveja de Anda, Linda Gavel Webb and husband Arthur Heberer III, Daphne Diebold Stoughton and husband James Stoughton, Frank Gavel, Jr., and wife Laurie McKee Gavel, Stephen Gavel, and Caitlin Diebold and husband Kevin O'Connell; and great-grandchildren Juan-Maria Naveja Diebold, Thomas Gavel, Charles Webb, Rebecca Gavel. In addition, Mrs. Diebold leaves behind her dear friends Shirley Gilbert and Olive Simpson, as well as many wonderful nurses and staff in Roxbury and Boca Grande, who gave her kind and loving care for years. Born in Brooklyn, New York on February 3, 1905, the former Dorothy Roosen attended the Ogontz School in Pennsylvania, where she excelled in field hockey and book binding and earnestly studied the works of John Glasworthy, before making her debut in New York City and marrying Albert Richard Diebold there in 1931. A stalwart of the St. James Church altar guild in New York City, as well as that of Christ Church in Roxbury and St. Andrew's Church in Boca Grande, Mrs. Diebold was an award winning needle-pointer, who made many beautiful pieces for her churches, including the magnificent kneelers that are used to this day.

Known as a formidable grande dame and arbiter of social correctness, Mrs. Diebold was also an amazingly gracious hostess and supremely generous and thoughtful friend, who appreciated the special essence of everyone she met. She taught her grandchildren to call her Mumsie and somewhere along the line, everyone started calling her Mumsie.

She was born on April 4, 1914 in Mablehurst, Wisconsin, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert James Moody. After her family moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, she attended St. Mary's Hall and then the University of Minnesota where she earned a BBA degree. It was there that she met William Stuart Baring-Gould whom she married in 1936. Mrs. Baring-Gould and her husband moved to New York City where he was originally employed by Hearst Publishing (later by Time, Inc.). In 1952 Mrs. Baring-Gould and her family moved to Pound Ridge, NY, where they had purchased a 200 year-old Colonial farmhouse. In 1962 Mrs. Baring-Gould co-authored with her husband ""The Annotated Mother Goose"". The book was reviewed on the front page of the ""New York Times Book Review"" and became a bestseller. Mrs. Baring-Gould was committed to her community of Pound Ridge and was active in government there. She was the first President of the Pound Ridge League of Women Voters and a member of the Board of Directors of the New York State League of Women Voters. She was the first woman elected to any town office when she was elected to the Town Council in 1968. She served as Deputy Town Supervisor for seven years. After the death of her husband and son, she turned her interests toward real estate in the 1970s. She became a licensed broker with the firm Houlihan/Lawrence, Inc. and was a member of Sotheby's International Realty. Her endeavors in real estate resulted in a number of local and national awards, ranging from membership in the Million Dollar Club every year for thirty-two years, the Gold Award for top sales in Westchester County, and the Realtor of the Year Award for Westchester County. She was President of the Westchester Women's Council of Realtors and was on the Executive Committee of the Westchester Board of Realtors. Mrs. Baring-Gould was active on the board of directors of several organizations, among them the Westchester Lighthouse for the Blind, the Seven Springs Foundation, and the Pound Ridge Nature Conservancy (now the Pound Ridge Land Conservancy) where she was Chairperson for ten years. Mrs. Baring-Gould moved from New York to Atlanta to be near her daughter and family, living at Canterbury Court. She was one of the founders of the Canterbury Court Book Club. Although Mrs. Baring-Gould was preceded in death by her son, William Drake Baring-Gould II, in 1966, and her husband, William Stuart Baring-Gould, in 1967, she is survived by her daughter, Judy Baring-Gould Orthwein, and son-in-law, Adolphus Busch Orthwein, Jr., and by her grandchildren, Adolphus Busch Orthwein III and wife Ellen, William Drake Orthwein and wife Tabitha, and Pam Orthwein Jensen and husband Colby.

This was George Soros's first US-based philanthropic initiative and received $5 million dollars a year over nine years. The mission of PDIA, which Dr. Butler helped create, was to transform the culture and experience of death and dying in the United States. Dr. Butler worked tirelessly with the other members of the advisory board to plan and develop each of the various program initiatives including the PDIA Faculty Scholars Program and the Social Work Leadership Development Program. Both of these initiatives have significantly contributed to the development of the current leadership of palliative care in the US. Dr. Butler was the founder of the National Institute on Aging at the National Institute of Health and advocated for the aging before Congress and the United Nations. He helped start and led the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry, the Alzheimer's Disease Association and the International Longevity Center. Dr. Butler's leadership and constant advocacy on behalf of the elderly guaranteed their representation across all of PDIA's project initiatives, including the development of palliative care programs in nursing homes. In an interview with Dr. David Clark, the author of the History of the Project on Death in America, Dr. Butler summarizes, ""Death will always be with us, pushed around a bit to be sure, with one fatal disease superseded by another. For every birth, someone long ago happened to notice, there is one death. We cannot and will not change that fact. But we can change the way people are cared for at the end of life, and we can substantially reduce the burden of illness. It is not, after all, death that people seem to fear the most, and certainly not in old age, but a life poorly lived. Something can be done about that.""

2010-07-11T00:00:00Z,"ORB--John A.,1919-2010. John Orb, former chief executive officer of Smith Barney and pioneer in retail sales and investment banking, died in San Francisco Saturday June 26th surrounded by friends and family. He was 91. He died after a long illness, his family said. Mr. Orb was born in Chicago, Illinois on February 9, 1919. The following year after his father died, his mother and he relocated to San Antonio, Texas where he was reared. When Mr. Orb was thirteen years old, they moved across the Atlantic to Europe. Mr. Orb returned to the United States to attend the Taft School, a private boarding school in Watertown, Connecticut, and a pivotal experience in his life. After graduating, Mr. Orb attended Yale University where he earned his degree in 1941. Following his academic career, Mr. Orb enrolled in The United States Army Air Corp flying program. In 1942, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in The United States Army Air Force and earned his wings. During World War II, Mr. Orb rose to the rank of Lietenant Colonel and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his bravey leading a formation of B-26 fighter planes suffering intense anti-aircraft fire to demolish a bridge near Roccasecca, Italy. He distinguished himself through his aggressiveness, superior tactical skill, leadership, and bravery to precisely destroy a target that withstood a number of previous assaults. After the war, Mr. Orb returned to his native Chicago. He became an account executive at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith where he established the Chicago office and rose to become Manager and Group Vice-President. In 1968, he transferred to the New York office where he eventually became Executive Vice-President and Director. Mr. Orb was responsible for the sales, investment banking and marketing divisions. His management style was honed in the partnership phase of Merrill where he learned the art of sharing responsibilities and being held accountable for results. He retired in 1974. Mr. Orb came out of retirement to join Smith Barney, the investment banking and brokerage firm and the principal subsidary of the holding company Smith Barney Inc., in 1975 as executive vice president and a director. He was elected President and Chief Operating Officer in 1977. In 1982, Mr. Orb served as Chief Executive Officer for both Smith Barney Inc. and Smith Barney, Harris Upham -- the 12th senior partner or chief executive in the firm's 114th-year history. In 1983, he became chairman of both companies. Mr. Orb entered Smith Barney during a crucial period in the company's long history when the firm sought to add a retail brokerage structure to its primarily institutional brokerage business. Through the years, Mr. Orb instrumented the firm's expansion to a full-service organization by building its product line and marketing efforts. He pioneered a new era with the well-known marketing campaign, ""Smith Barney makes money the old-fashioned way. We earn it,"" which became renowned in marketing and advertising history. John's talent, belief and persistance altered the course of the firm as it entered a new era of retail sales and investment banking. Mr. Orb's support of The Taft School spanned eight decades as a student, father, grandfather, volunteer, and trustee. Mr. Orb attributed much of his success to his experience at The Taft School. The school acknowledged his years of contribution with a Citation of Merit in May of 2010.

2010-07-11T00:00:00Z,"SUMMER STUDIES When Ellen told Mary about the secret lake she swore her to silence but Mary invited Jerome who couldn't even swim and Luanne came with him and it was funny that summer the way that scarce resources collided with the whole system of who was cool, or not the old rule being that who was cool would get to stay that way by jumping into the lake and who was not would have to stay hot and dirty by simple omission of information. But that dry summer the rumors spread: someone was giving out maps, someone was giving tutorials in every twist and bobby-pin turn you had to take in the red dirt road that got you there. When you got near you could hear through the trees splashes and cries of people who might not even be friends. And the clear water, like the social milieu that summer was quite frankly stirred up, confused thanks to the leaky lips, Ellen said, of certain persons who would let anyone in. - TONY HOAGLAND, author of ''Unincorporated Persons in the Late Honda Dynasty'' COME LIVE WITH ME Heat exists as energy in transit, something spontaneous, volatile, elementary, ''something which may be transferred from one body to another'' (James Clerk Maxwell, ''Theory of Heat''). Notice how it moves from an object with a high temperature to an object with a lower one, a process of thermal contact, the sun burning through the coldest morning sky. Heat increases and flows across boundaries. It is ancient, fluctuating, vibrational, like these summer days that are so combustible and these nights when stars enlighten the skies. I remember the time you touched me near the stove and the flames sparked in my body, love. - EDWARD HIRSCH, author of ''The Living Fire: New and Selected Poems''"

2010-07-11T00:00:00Z,"IN 1970, when Helmut Newton came down with the flu and was unable to shoot an ad for Gitanes cigarettes, his wife, June, then an Australian actress with no formal photography training, stepped in and did it. ''I knew I was in business,'' she later recalled, ''when a check arrived in the mail addressed to Helmut.'' For the next four decades, June (who also served as Newton's art director) photographed under the name Alice Springs -- a pseudonym chosen blindfolded, with a pin in hand and a map of Australia before her. She shot stories for French Vogue and Elle, and ads for Jean Louis David, but her intimate portraits of everyone from Robert Mapplethorpe (center right) to Brigitte Nielsen (right) to the Hells Angels set her apart. ''Her pictures of people are totally innocent,'' her husband once said. ''I don't know of anyone else who takes the same kind of portraits.''"

Vuvuzelas aside, this World Cup, which comes to a close Sunday with the final match between Spain and the Netherlands, was really not so different than those of the past. European and South American teams retained their global dominance. England fizzled. Referees were lambasted, goal-line technology clamored for (mostly by those on the short end of the calls) and players once again dived all over the field, feigning injury in hopes of securing a precious free kick. Yet there was a key difference this year. Never before were fans across the planet so connected to each other through the Internet. And connect they did. Millions of people used Facebook, the world's largest social networking site, to voice both ecstasy and woe throughout the tournament about their favorite players. Below, the players Facebook users talked about, worldwide, during the tournament. One potential sign that soccer may have arrived in the U.S.?

2010-07-11T00:00:00Z,"Passport fees are increasing effective July 13, the State Department recently announced. The cost of getting a brand-new passport for someone 16 or older has jumped 35 percent, to $135 from $100, and for those under 16 has increased by nearly 25 percent, to $105 from $85. If you've already got your passport, you're not immune: the cost of renewing your passport for those 16 and over has increased 47 percent, to $110 from $75. Travelers heading to Mexico and Canada by land or sea and those heading to the Caribbean by sea can save a few bucks by using a passport card, which for adults will cost $55 (a $10 increase) and for children will cost $40 (up $5). Among the other changes that could affect travelers: a new fee of $82 for appending pages to your passport, which will undoubtedly affect mainly globetrotters whose visas and stamps are overflowing, and an increase in the fee for reporting a birth abroad ($100 from $65). The fee hikes are among several consular fees being increased after what the department called an exhaustive study of the true cost of providing consular services."

Suppose the summer peak load also included plug-in electric cars? The consumption from a charging E.V. can cause a home's load to double, so it's worth considering the potential for electric cars to cause brownouts when more of the cars are eventually on the streets. Also, because E.V.'s are relatively expensive, their ownership is likely to be concentrated in more affluent areas, which means some neighborhoods could feel the power strain more than others."

There is something of a church-and-state divide in couture, with clients in private appointments with a saleswoman on the couture side of a house - separate salon, separate entrance - and editors giving their interpretations of the clothes. Toward the end of Yves Saint Laurent's career, when he was still doing couture collections, I would sometimes accompany a few friends who were regular clients - Nan Kempner, among them - on their appointments at YSL. It was fascinating to watch them go through the clothes. They saw them in a completely different way than I did. They were buying pieces for a wardrobe.

The cause was a brain hemorrhage which she suffered on June 20, 2010. Formerly of Manhasset and Bridgehampton, Long Island, NY, she last resided in Palm Beach Gardens, PGA National Resort and Spa Community. She was a graduate of Finch College and Katherine Gibbs School in New York City. While at Katherine Gibbs, she developed a close friendship with stage actress, Leora Dana, attending such theatre productions as Point of No Return at the Alvin Theatre staring her and Henry Fonda. They graduated together. In the forties, she worked for the President of American Airlines at LaGuardia Airport, where she later met her husband, George Habian, an award winning inventor, writer and Executive Engineer who owned patents on airplane polishing equipment and was a designer/draftsman at The Port Authority of NY and NJ at The World Trade Towers. Mr. Habian predeceased Doris in 1985 from cancer. Doris was a lady of great style, independent and cultured, with a love of home and children. She was an accomplished pianist and equestrian. She and her husband loved Opera and were members of the American Airlines Glee Club and the Rockefeller Choristers. She was a very loving, unselfish person, who put everyone's needs before her own. She was a friend and guiding light to her two children. ""Two kids could not have asked for a better Mother with regard to instilling values, getting a proper education and preparing two people for their course in the world."" (Quote from her son, Bruce.) She leaves behind a daughter, Lynn Diane (International Concert Pianist) formerly of Palm Beach, FL, and a son, Bruce George (lawyer) of NYC and Water Mill, Long Island, NY. She was mother-in-law to Joy Fedden-Habian (Architect) and Robert Harris Grogan (former well known retired Wall Street bank lawyer). Also, grandmother to the Habian girls, Laura Grace and Christina George. Services were held on Thursday, July 1, 2010 at Quattlebaum Funeral Home in West Palm Beach, FL. During the viewing a slide show was given encompassing the early, middle and later years of her life. A Mass followed at the Historic Catholic Church of St. Ann in West Palm Beach, FL. The original church was constructed in 1895. The current church (1913) is a gem to this day, with stained glass windows from Mayer's of Munich that are simply breathtaking. During Holy Communion of the Mass, Maurice Ravel's Pianoforte Solo 'Pavane pour une infante defunte' was performed. The Sanctuary window is dedicated to Henry Flagler who died the year the church was built. President John F. Kennedy attended his last Sunday Mass at St. Ann's on November 17, 1963. A service at The Chapel of Holy Rood Catholic Cemetery preceded the burial at the family Crypt in Westbury, Long Island, NY on July 8, 2010, which was arranged by Fairchild Funeral Home of Garden City, Long Island, NY.

Hughes was thrilled, but he started to wonder how he would fit in. ''Obviously, we're not going to go with a six-man rotation in the second half,'' Hughes said. ''Something's got to give. You kind of do the math and figure it won't be the top three guys, so where do we fall into that picture? That's kind of the way this game is. It's not always about feel-good stories and keeping the guys that were around in spring training. Sometimes, it happens. I'm happy that everything stayed the same.''"

They stopped at this spot by chance, the morning they were heading home after seeing a nearby glacier. Then they saw the water, Mr. Albert said, and decided they all wanted to jump in. ''The first time you jump in, it's the kind of cold where it takes your breath away,'' said Mr. Albert, 39, an accountant from Wasco, Calif., who spends his spare time hiking and backpacking. ''At first you jump in and you jump back out it's so cold. But after a while, you get used to it and you can stay in.'' As told to Monica Drake"

Her strength, generosity, kindness and love enriched her family which included eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren as well as her community in which she was a forceful, visionary and dedicated leader. The author of three books and numerous short stories and poems, she opened a window to her soul and taught us how, with love and compassion, we can survive and even flourish through unspeakable horrors, whether they are engendered by the Holocaust or by family illness. Truly a role model for the modern woman, her life has been an inspiration and she will live on through the memory of all who had the good fortune of knowing her."

He was the director of the Lapis Press founded by the artist Sam Francis and was the founding director of the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills. Robert attended the University of California, Berkeley and received his M.A. and Ph.D. in English from Harvard University. He was a member of the Photographic Committee at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and a life member of the Institute for Modern Russian Culture. For his work at the Lapis Press, Robert was named Chevalier in the Order of Arts and Letters by Jack Lang, French Minister of Culture.

Among the artists Robert brought into the Gagosian Gallery were Cecily Brown, Kristen Calabrese, Mark Licari, and Robert Therrien. Upon resigning from the Gallery in 2006, Robert volunteered in many community programs assisting disadvantaged youth. Under the auspices of Inside Out Writers Program, he taught a writing workshop for incarcerated girls at Central Juvenile Hall in Los Angeles. He worked with the Sherry Lansing Foundation and was a member of the Advisory Board at the Center for Juvenile Law and Policy at Loyola Law School, and at Lamp Community assisting mentally ill homeless in Los Angeles. Throughout his life, Robert loved to travel, often to remote regions in Africa, the Middle East and India. He was a guest lecturer at the American University in Cairo, Egypt. He sponsored the education of several children in Africa, India, and the Philippines. He will be missed for his great sense of humor, keen wit, and his boundless energy and enthusiasm."
2010-07-11T00:00:00Z,"Things I saw on the beach one morning: an empty vodka bottle, four blackened cigar stubs, numerous cigarette butts, two different broken flip-flops, a large jagged piece of broken glass (this I picked up and carried to the nearest trash receptacle), an abandoned striped beach towel - soaked now by the high tide - and a fresh pile of dog feces. There is always a fresh pile of dog feces, even though there are signs on all entrance paths to the beach stating that from June 1 to Sept. 15 dogs are not allowed on the beach. I have reached the conclusion that for some people the beach - at least this one, in Ocean City, N.J. - is seen as a giant receptacle available for their own personal disposal purposes, even though, like most beaches, our beach has numerous trash and recycling bins set up at convenient intervals."

On July 8th his myriad of health issues finally claimed him. John grew up in the Bronx, graduating from SIA (High School for Industrial Art).

2010-07-11T00:00:00Z,"SO a cartoonist walks into a dance studio. It sounds like the setup to a surreal joke, and for Art Spiegelman the experience of collaborating with the venerable dance company Pilobolus has certainly had its off-kilter moments. Pilobolus, which takes its name from a fungus, has lately become known for finding co-conspirators in unusual places; last year it enlisted the head writer of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' to work on a piece. But while Mr. Spiegelman is known for many things, especially his Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel, ''Maus,'' contemporary dance isn't one of them. Still, he and Pilobolus began working together last year, and the upshot, ''Hapless Hooligan in 'Still Moving,' '' will be seen in New York when the troupe begins its new season at the Joyce Theater on Monday. Though, as Mr. Spiegelman details below, the process could be awkward at times, it couldn't have been all bad. Reviewing the world premiere at Dartmouth College last month in The New York Times, Alastair Macaulay described a ''dizzying overlap of cartoon, film, silhouette theater, and live dance,'' creating an effect so strange ''it's as if we're being given a fleeting glimpse of the inner workings of the universe.''

He acknowledged that ''pitching is always a commodity that you seek'' but said he thought that his starting pitchers were doing fine and that there were other areas that the Mets might be better advised to address."

Crew, but his sympathies are more British punk than Ivy League preppy - it's not hard to imagine Joe Strummer, circa 1980, suiting up in one of Hamilton's rapier-thin blazers. (His women's line, which he introduced last fall, is equally sharp.) And his references tend to be peppered with black humor. His spring 2011 men's collection, which was scheduled to be staged during the recent men's shows in Paris but was canceled at the last minute due to budgetary constraints, was inspired by the Belgian artist Michaël Borremans's somber portraits of workers in their uniforms. ""The surfaces were very chic and painterly,"" Hamilton explains. ""But they all looked depressed - that's where the dark part comes in.""

When the starter's box at the Old Course, one of golf's most recognizable structures, was put up for auction during a 2001 renovation, the author, John Peter Hagen, decided to bid on it. It was a dream and a belief in the power of a symbol - the decades-old little box had sent off all the great golfers of the 20th century, countless duffers, and presidents and kings, too. And from it, at the start of every round, came three stately words: Play Away, Please. Hagen, a California-based housing developer and an avid golfer, bought the box on the day before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. The rest of the story takes nearly eight years as the weather-beaten box is dismantled and shipped some 7,000 miles. Travails and surprises ensue. This becomes a story that is as much about a place, St. Andrews, and its people, as it is about a distinctive tiny hut. It's about chasing a passion, and it's about the price, literally and figuratively, one can pay for it. Again, this isn't your usual golf book, and it takes a leap of faith. But it is a very romantic, quixotic journey, and in that context, it makes it all about golf."

One expert has estimated New Yorkers are stopped at twice the national rate.

This can lead to some atypical circumstances, like a player's ball coming to rest in the hole for the 16th while he was playing the 2nd hole. What's the appropriate play from there?"

The Toronto-based boutique fleet's comfy leather seats and seamless service come at the cost of coach but feel like flying private. O.K., maybe I'm getting a little carried away. But on two recent flights from Newark to Toronto, I zipped through check-in, security and customs, and because Porter operates out of Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, you're only a short ferry ride away from the heart of downtown. Add to this business-class-level lounges (the one at Billy Bishop is particularly well appointed), state-of-the-art equipment (fast, clean and quiet Bombardier 400 turboprops) and a fairly flexible booking structure. Not to mention the adorable uniforms: the female flight attendants wear tailored navy suits and dresses with jaunty pillbox hats from the Canadian label Pink Tartan while serving up the complimentary snacks, soft drinks, beer and wine.

We Sox fans didn't need to hate him; serious Yankee fans did that for us, bemoaning the constant psychodrama, the managerial revolving door, the ill-advised spending sprees and the trades that always seemed to ship off good young players to get veterans who were just about to pass their peak. Those were the Yankees of Steve Trout and Ed Whitson, Andy Hawkins and Mel Hall, the Ken Phelps-for-Jay Buhner trade and the long slow decline of Don Mattingly, their only true 1980s great. And then they were the Yankees of Howard Spira, the gambler who Steinbrenner paid to gather dirt on Dave Winfield, leading to the Yankee owner's suspension from baseball ""for life""  in 1990. His team went 67-95 that year, 71-91 the next, and it seemed like Steinbrenner would be remembered as the owner who saved Yankee baseball in the 1970s only to destroy it a decade later."

Until now, the only definitive way to diagnose Alzheimer's has been to search for plaque with a brain autopsy after the patient dies. Scientists hope the new scanning technique, described June 24 in The New York Times's series ''The Vanishing Mind,'' will allow doctors to see plaque while the patient is still alive, improving diagnosis and aiding research on drugs to slow or stop plaque accumulation."

2010-07-14T00:00:00Z,"COOPER--Howard Morton, Mortgage Broker, Dies at 83. Howard Cooper, a long time mortgage broker, died peacefully at Ellis Hospital in Niskayuna, New York on Monday. He was 83 and lived in New York City and East Hampton, NY. His daughter, Dr. Karen Cooper, said the direct cause of death was mild heart failure after a long and courageous battle with Alzheimer's Disease. Howard Cooper was born in Mt. Vernon, NY on August 21, 1926 to Samuel and Clara Cooper, both Russian immigrants. He was the youngest of four children. After graduating high school he attended Iona College in New Rochelle, NY and left to enlist in the Army in 1945. He served our country as an airplane crew chief with the 25th Tactical Reconnaisance Squadron at Itami Army Air Base in Osaka, Japan. He was responsible for the repair and maintenance of P-51s. Thus began his love of airplanes and flying. In 1947 he returned from the Army with an honorable discharge and began working with his father, Sam, as a salesman at Junior Formals, Inc. In 1951 he went to work with his father-in-law the late and well-loved Nathan J. Sonnenblick at Sonnenblick-Goldman Corp who taught him the business of mortgage brokerage which became one of the true loves of his life. In 1964 Howard co founded Cooper-Horowitz, Inc. which became one of the top respected powerhouses in the Mortgage Brokerage business. His love of airplanes took him soaring to the sky as a pilot in his Cessna and he always found peace at his house in East Hampton, NY where he enjoyed gardening and walks on the beach. His children and grandchildren were a great source of pleasure and he always wanted to be a part of their lives. He will be deeply missed by his children, Peter, Karen and Neal; their spouses, Denny Allen and Jody; his grandchildren, Sasha, Joshua, Casey and Caroline. ""The Chief"" as he was known to so many touched every one's life who had the great fortune to meet him and will always be remembered for his charismatic personality and love of life. A celebration of life will be Thursday, July 15th at The Riverside, 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave at 11:30am. Interrment will be a 4pm reception at Bobby Vans on 46 St. and Park Ave. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Alzheimer's Foundation of America at alzfdn.org."

Bob was an original; a semi-celebrity from Williamsburg, Brooklyn; and the time of many people's lives. His true gift was the art of storytelling where the most mundane of events were told with humor, suspense, and emotion. Bob's flair for the dramatic led him to the stage, where he was the star of many plays for the Brooklyn College Players and the Monticello Playhouse at Kiamesha Lake, New York in 1955. His finest hour was his depiction of Willie Loman in Death of a Salesman. All of Bob's reviews garnered glowing praise. While he loved the stage, he decided to partner with his brother Jerry to build what would be a very successful electronic tube distribution business, allowing him to retire at the age of 39. Bob always made choices that were ahead of his time, which allowed him to enjoy life to the fullest with his true love and late wife Evelyn: becoming a health food nut and jogger before they were trendy; delighting in the sparsely populated Hamptons in the 60's; investing in technology startups like IBM and Intel, and crisscrossing the country in the family motor-home during the summers. Bob is survived by his adoring daughters, Abbe Bensimon, Wendy Harris, and Alice Meyer, his three sons-in-law, his seven grandchildren, all of whom he was exceedingly proud of, his devoted brother Jerry Sohne and sister Eleanor Marcus and treasured nieces and nephews.

2010-07-15T14:30:50Z,"""British forces invaded Tibet in 1904 and administered it until 1947. Their aim was to create what they self-consciously called a 'buffer state' to protect their immense interests in India, then run by the British Raj, from potential advances by Russia and China. Tibet was turned into a guard dog for Britain's vast Indian Empire. And the British discovered that the idea of Tibet as a mystical, paranormal land - that is, not a normal state and certainly not a part of those other normal states of China or Russia - was a very useful propaganda tool ... Indeed, it is during that period of the self-serving Orientalism of British rule in Tibet that the popular modern image of Tibet as a mystical, cut-off entity takes shape - most notably in James Hilton's Lost Horizon (1933), which invented the idea of 'Shangri La' ... The writings of the British imperialists, and of their sympathisers, are still regularly cited in the propaganda produced by the Dalai Lama's people, which is designed to prove that Tibet is a unique and special place that only they can and should govern ... What connects the old imperialists with the new Tibetophiles is their desire to have Tibet as a 'buffer state' - only where the imperialists wanted to use Tibet to protect their material interests against China and Russia, the new lot want to use it to protect their emotional interests, to preserve an idea of innocent, childlike humanity so far uncorrupted by modernity."""

2010-07-15T11:12:54Z,"""Christian Marclay: Festival"" at the Whitney Museum is aptly titled, since some form of music, much of it live, will be audible at all times during the show's run. In the late 1970s, Mr. Marclay, an artist-composer-performer, became one of the first musicians to use a turntable as an instrument, but he is equally known in the art world for music-related collages and skillfully edited videos. His penchant for placing equal emphasis on the visual and the aural permeates the Whitney show. Most of the works on display - whether they are made of found objects, images, album covers, LPs, clothes, film footage or texts - can be used as musical scores. And they will be used, often several times during the show's run, by a rotating roster of musicians that includes some of the biggest names from the avant-garde music scene. An artist as dedicated to mixing media as Mr. Marclay deserves the attention of critics from more than one discipline. Roberta Smith, the New York Times art critic who reviewed the exhibition on July 8, and Nate Chinen, one of The Times's music critics, discuss his work from their respective perspectives."

''If this country has been misled, if this committee, this Congress, has been misled by pretext into a war in which thousands of young men have died, and many more thousands have been crippled for life, and out of which their country has lost prestige, moral position in the world, the consequences are very great,'' Senator Albert Gore Sr. of Tennessee, the father of the future vice president, said in March 1968 in a closed session of the Foreign Relations Committee."

''We got a strong request to change the wording,'' said Seth Goldman, co-founder of Honest Tea. In the end, Mr. Goldman held his ground, and Coke -- which owns an option to buy the rest of Honest Tea next year -- accepted the decision. The Honest Kids packaging now on store shelves continues to proclaim, ''no high fructose corn syrup'' (see the photo above). The decision, Mr. Goldman said, ''shows we do stand for something.''"

(13) HAMLET Simon Keenlyside, above center, performs the title role, and Marlis Petersen is Ophélie in this Metropolitan Opera staging by Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser of Ambroise Thomas's opera, which was last performed at the Met in 1897. Reviewing this production, presented here by ''Great Performances at the Met,'' Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times in March: ''Musically 'Hamlet' is no masterpiece. But this five-act French opera, which had its premiere in Paris in 1868, is a refined, subtle and, at its best, affectingly understated work, qualities that came through in the sensitive and magisterial conducting of Louis Langrée.'' Of Mr. Keenlyside, whom Mr. Tommasini called ''the Ralph Fiennes of baritones,'' he said: ''His singing was an uncanny amalgam, at once elegant and wrenching, intelligent and fitful,'' adding, ''You could not take your eyes off him.'' 9 P.M.

2010-07-17T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (Cinemax) JENNIFER'S BODY (2009) With its gory set pieces and story ''as full of holes as some of its disemboweled victims,'' this film, ''a bloody high school demonic-possession, serial-killer comedy written by Diablo Cody, directed by Karyn Kusama and starring Megan Fox in the title role, is an unholy mess,'' A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. He meant it, he said, as a compliment. Ms. Fox's Jennifer, above, is a dream girl -- the kind other girls envy and all the boys want, at least before she's transformed into a succubus by a run-in with an indie-rock band, and those same young men start dying in droves. Amanda Seyfried plays Jennifer's best friend and social antithesis, Anita, or Needy for short. ''Hell,'' she says, ''is a teenage girl.'' ''Juno,'' written by Ms. Diablo, gave us Ellen Page's sharp-tongued young heroine, and ''Girlfight,'' directed by Ms. Kusama, served up Michelle Rodriguez's bruised protagonist. Needy, ''our Virgil in Ms. Cody and Ms. Kusama's tour of teenage hell, so nimbly personified by Ms. Seyfried, belongs in this company,'' Mr. Scott added. ''She's the main reason to see 'Jennifer's Body.' '' 10:30 A.M.

2010-07-18T00:00:00Z,"On weekends, King Street West between Spadina Avenue and Bathurst Street is like one long fashion runway, with its see-and-be-seen restaurants, bars and clubs. During the week, it's where a group of particularly creative local residents work, in entertainment and design, and where many live, too, in the loft-style condo developments sprouting up by the day. King West feels like one of those glamorous, tourist-friendly neighborhoods that was once to be avoided, like the meatpacking district in New York. At the turn of the 20th century, King Street was a textile-manufacturing hub, but by the 1980s, many of the sturdy but humble brick buildings sat empty, so the city rezoned the land for mixed development. In the shells of those old factories, a destination neighborhood was born. BRASSAII 461 King Street West (416) 598-4730 brassaii.com This popular restaurant reopened in March after an extensive renovation. The ''interpretive Mediterranean'' menu includes beef carpaccio dumplings (15 Canadian dollars, about the same in U.S. dollars) and lobster wonton ravioli (24 dollars). Around 10:30 p.m. on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, the place morphs into a lounge."

2010-07-18T00:00:00Z,"The sound is unlike any other: a dry, scraping noise made by a skateboard's wheels as they roll across a concrete surface - part of the city's summer cacophony. I heard it just the other day, coming up fast behind me as I waited for the light to change at 21st Street and Park Avenue South. Turning quickly, I expected to see a teenager in baggy pants wheeling down the sidewalk, motioning for me to get out of the way. Instead, it was a fortysomething guy who looked like bald, portly Kevin from ''The Office.'' I shouldn't have been surprised. Older Gen Xers and even some baby boomers have been making their way around the city this way for a long time. You see them every day, weaving between pedestrians on the sidewalk or rolling up the bicycle lane on Avenue of the Americas. And they aren't just riding skateboards. Increasingly, the conveyance of choice for these aging commuters is the scooter - not the motorized kind, but a sleeker version of the type that Dennis the Menace rode when he wasn't terrorizing Mr. Wilson."

Then they work their aquatic magic, self-sustained by circulation pumps, powered by hydraulics and in most cases protected by bromine filtration systems. (No chlorine because it's too harsh on century-old stone and bronze statuary.) Pennies from wish-makers are far from the only offerings made to these people magnets. Also tossed in are thousands of other coins, cellphones, jewelry, cameras, shoes, sandwich wrappings and the occasional dead rat. ''Sometimes we fish people out of the fountains, but unlike the rats, they're alive,'' said Al Simoncini, who is responsible for making sure that Brooklyn's three city fountains run properly.

2010-07-18T00:00:00Z,"In 1982, researchers affiliated with the Cooper Institute in Dallas surveyed a large group of well-educated, affluent men. The researchers were interested in the men's exercise habits, but they also asked, almost incidentally, about their indolence. Specifically, they inquired about how many hours each day the men spent watching television or sitting in a car. (This was before you could do both at once.) Over the years, the survey's main results were used to reinforce a growing body of science about the health benefits of regular exercise. But the information about the amount of time the men spent being inactive remained largely unexplored. Recently, however, scientists from the University of South Carolina and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La., parsed the full data. In a study published in May in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, they reported that, to no one's surprise, the men who sat the most had the greatest risk of heart problems. Men who spent more than 23 hours a week watching TV and sitting in their cars (as passengers or as drivers) had a 64 percent greater chance of dying from heart disease than those who sat for 11 hours a week or less. What was unexpected was that many of the men who sat long hours and developed heart problems also exercised. Quite a few of them said they did so regularly and led active lifestyles. The men worked out, then sat in cars and in front of televisions for hours, and their risk of heart disease soared, despite the exercise. Their workouts did not counteract the ill effects of sitting."
2010-07-18T00:00:00Z,"Whenever I travel abroad, one of my first pit stops is the local farmacia. I'm always in the market for old-school apothecary products or those nifty Birkenstock-like house sandals you can only find in German drug stores. Recently, I hit the mother lode at A Vida Portuguesa, a general store tucked on a side street in Lisbon's Chiado neighborhood. The shop, housed in a former soap factory, features traditional, handcrafted products from all over the country, from toothpaste (the national brand, Couto, comes in a smart-looking orange tube) to countless tinctures and pomades (in handsome green glass bottles). Some of the products, like the pretty Claus Porto soaps, are more popular, while the Bordalo Pinheiro ceramics are harder to come by. Perhaps this amazing archive of authentic Portuguese products is a serious stand against the globalization and fast retailing that seems to have taken over the rest of the E.U. But for me, well, I'm just a sucker for all that hip retro packaging. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

(Of special interest is Tony Judt's moving essay ''Words'' in The New York Review of Books.) Though it's clear that mainstream publications are challenged by the Internet, small magazines keep turning up. One of the funnier, readable fashion mags to come along in a while is I Like My Style Quarterly, a spinoff of ilikemystyle.net, a social network site started two years ago by Adriano Sack. He's a journalist who divides his time between Berlin and New York and writes a style column for the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag. I Like My Style is about the size of a small-town phone book with a ruggedly assured world view of style seekers. The first issue explains its purpose by asking a series of questions followed by answers. The last in the series is ''And who are you guys?'' Answer: ''A bunch of friends from Berlin, New York, Texas, Austria and Hong Kong.'' Mr. Sack says he believes the publication is the first ever user-generated fashion magazine. All of the content is created by users of ilikemystyle.net. The quality of the images is surprisingly good, and the ideas are fresh and interesting. And if some of the pictures are blurry - well, the editors said, that's the way the world looks at times. Immediate, subjective, and fuzzy."

2010-07-18T00:00:00Z,"KASNER--Edward. For those who were fortunate enough to know Edward Kasner, you can attest to the fact he, known to us as Murph, was a wonderful man. As a grandfather, he instilled in us values of kindness and the importance of family by which we have lived our lives. At family holidays, he vocalized his love for Jewish tradition and culture, leading the chorus on prayers and imparting bits of wisdom from his years as a devout observer of the Jewish faith. As a friend, he told numerous stories about his life as a Navy officer, his experience at his beloved Penn State University, and the courtship of his wife and our Grandmother, Edna. If you were lucky enough to have experienced a meal with Murph, you surely would have heard one of his signature tales. As a fan, he spent countless hours retelling his time spent watching the famed Knicks teams of the 70's, of which he was almost a part. As a Penn State Nitney Lion power forward in the 1930's, he mastered the art of the rebound, always reminding us of the importance of boxing out during our own basketball endeavors. As a man, he was a truly a man of the people. He befriended anyone in ear distance, whether on the subway, in his factories in Brooklyn, or while making ice cream as a dairy major at Penn State. He inculcated in us the need to work diligently in school, in our jobs, and in our personal lives. Above all else, Murph was an inspiration. He has been, and always will be, a role model. While he is no longer with us, we have been so lucky to have shared so many amazing memories with him that he will be a part of us forever."

If you've visited any other haunts in East London, you can imagine the place: Edison light bulbs, a staff sporting asymmetrical haircuts, old tires and bike parts hanging from exposed ceiling pipes. Vintage bikes and heirloom tomatoes dress up the window displays, and a scattering of desks and built-in benches fill up most of the room. Despite the occasional suit-wearing office worker who wanders in for lunch, Look Mum No Hands functions as a kind of cyclists' salon. Serious riders bring in expensive racing bikes for repairs; bike messengers sit in the attached courtyard fueling up with quinoa salads; and curious commuters lock up their bikes out front and come in to use the free Wi-Fi or study one of the giant cycling maps. There are weekly events, from route planning sessions to bicycle film nights, and the bar stays open until 10 p.m. serving up chilled microbrews from France, Italy and Spain.

Part of the problem with meritocracy is that it homogenizes in the name of diversity: It skims the cream from every race and class and population, puts all of the best and brightest through the same educational conveyor belt, and comes out with a ruling class that's cosmetically diverse but intellectually conformist, and that tends to huddle together rather than spreading out to enrich the country as a whole. This is Christopher Lasch's lament in ""The Revolt of the Elites"" - that meritocracy co-opts people who might otherwise become its critics, sapping local communities of their intellectual vitality and preventing any kind of rival power centers from emerging.

2010-07-19T00:00:00Z,"BALSER--Paula Bassett, was born on January 15, 1916 and died peacefully on July 9, 2010 at Broadmead in Baltimore. Mrs. Balser grew up in Camden and Ocean City, New Jersey and in Bronxville, New York, and she graduated from Duke University in 1937, Phi Beta Kappa. At Duke she was very active in social issues of the time, and she served as president of the student government in her senior year. Mrs. Balser received her MSW from New School of Social Work (Columbia University) in 1939 and began her career of service to her community with a position as psychiatric social worker with the Children's Aid Society. She married Dr. Benjamin Balser in 1939 and continued her social work career as a volunteer after her sons were born in 1942, 1943, and 1945. Mrs. Balser traveled extensively with her husband, a Doctor in psychiatry with the U.S. Army during the war and in the postwar period. She was tireless in her devotion to the people of New York City, and became deeply involved with the work of the Hudson Guild in Chelsea. She served there as a counselor, a social advocate, a liaison to the trustees and then a trustee herself. In 2006, a newly refurbished outpatient psychiatric counseling center was named for her in honor of her years of service there. From 1970 to 1977, Mrs. Balser served as a consultant to the New Jersey Juvenile Justice Department. From 1978 until 1989, she served on the City Hospital Visiting Committee, with a special focus on mental health and substance abuse services. In 1989, Mrs. Balser moved to Baltimore to live in the community of Broadmead in Cockeysville. There she was extremely active in social, cultural and intellectual activities, and she served on many committees, primarily those related to health issues, always adding her incisive comments to discussion. Mrs. Balser made many contributions to the social fabric there, and she was deeply committed to the shared values of the community. Mrs. Balser loved to help people and she loved to travel in the U.S. and abroad, but the center of her life was her husband, their three sons and her ever expanding extended family. In the last twenty years she was the central, beloved focus of many gatherings of family and friends. Mrs. Balser was predeceased by her husband, Dr. Benjamin Balser, and by her sister, Helen Bassett. She is survived by her three sons, Paul Balser of New York City, Richard Balser of Portland, Maine and Stephen Balser of Danbury, Connecticut and their wives, by seven grandchildren and by thirteen great-grandchildren.

2010-07-19T00:00:00Z,"KASNER--Edward. For those who were fortunate enough to know Edward Kasner, you can attest to the fact he, known to us as Murph, was a wonderful man. As a grandfather, he instilled in us values of kindness and the importance of family by which we have lived our lives. At family holidays, he vocalized his love for Jewish tradition and culture, leading the chorus on prayers and imparting bits of wisdom from his years as a devout observer of the Jewish faith. As a friend, he told numerous stories about his life as a Navy officer, his experience at his beloved Penn State University, and the courtship of his wife and our Grandmother, Edna. If you were lucky enough to have experienced a meal with Murph, you surely would have heard one of his signature tales. As a fan, he spent countless hours retelling his time spent watching the famed Knicks teams of the 70's, of which he was almost a part. As a Penn State Nitney Lion power forward in the 1930's, he mastered the art of the rebound, always reminding us of the importance of boxing out during our own basketball endeavors. As a man, he was a truly a man of the people. He befriended anyone in ear distance, whether on the subway, in his factories in Brooklyn, or while making ice cream as a dairy major at Penn State. He inculcated in us the need to work diligently in school, in our jobs, and in our personal lives. Above all else, Murph was an inspiration. He has been, and always will be, a role model. While he is no longer with us, we have been so lucky to have shared so many amazing memories with him that he will be a part of us forever. Brett and Jared"

(49) EL GENERAL (2009) In 1978 Alicia Calles began recording her memoirs with the hope of writing a book about her father, Plutarco Elías Calles, above, a general in the Mexican Revolution and the president of Mexico from 1924 to 1928, who left a controversial legacy. He founded the National Revolutionary Party, which, as the subsequent Institutional Revolutionary Party, governed the country for more than 70 years. He also fiercely oppressed Roman Catholics. Eventually Alicia Calles's granddaughter, Natalia Almada, inherited the tapes, creating not only a snapshot of her family's past but also a backdrop against which to better understand modern Mexico in this centennial year of the start of the revolution in 1910. The documentary, presented here by ''P.O.V.,'' earned Ms. Almada the directing award and a nomination for the grand jury prize at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. 8 P.M.

2010-07-21T00:00:00Z,"SWINSKY--Morton. Pioneering bond trader, art collector and multiple Tony Award-winning Broadway producer - died June 19, of prostate cancer. He was 75. Swinsky produced numerous plays and musicals, beginning with 'Eubie' and including hits such as 'Spamalot,' 'Spring Awakening,' David Mamet's 'Race,' 'Guys and Dolls' (Tony), 'Chicago' (Tony), 'Annie Get Your Gun' (Tony),'The Music Man,' 'The Who's Tommy,' 'Hamlet,' 'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,' 'Grey Gardens,' 'Jersey Boys' (Tony), 'A View From the Bridge,' 'Hairspray' (Tony), 'The History Boys,' 'Billy Elliot' (Tony) and, most recently, 'Fela!,' and 'The Addams Family.' Swinsky was the recipient of film and television awards (AFI, Emmy) for 'You Can Count On Me,' 'Boys Don't Cry' and the concert version of 'Sweeney Todd.' With all these successes, Mort seemed devoid of ego and hubris. Backing a quality play or musical is what brought him pleasure. That and collecting art. Recognized by The National Sculpture Society, Swinsky was a patron to artists mostly in the Figurative Arts. Born to immigrant parents of Russian Jewish descent, Swinsky was raised in the Inwood section of Manhattan. While at City College night school, where he met his wife Florence Swinsky (Pincus), he pursued a job with CJ Devine and Co., where his mind, memory, and ability to predict value propelled him to the top of his field. When Merrill Lynch consolidated operations with CJ Devine, the ""Devine Boys"" created a high percentage of Merrill's revenue, and were granted the autonomy to run Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc., with Swinsky as Executive Vice President. As a leader and pioneer in the trading of government bonds, Swinsky and his team left in 1980 to join William E. Pollock & Co and in 1990, the ""Udder Guys"" joined Fuji Securities. He retired from that firm as President. It was during his successful tenure on Wall Street that his eye for talent brought him into the world of Broadway and other arts. Mort touched so many people in his lifetime. He will be remembered and missed. He is survived by Florence, their two daughters Karen and Dana, and five grandchildren, Nikola, Dante and Thanos Carouso and Connor and Harry Cantelmo. A Memorial will be held Monday, July 26 at the Lotos Club, 5 East 66 St, 6:30 -8:30. Additional remembrances can be shared at legacy.com. Contributions in Mort's memory may be made to The National Sculpture Society, and The New York Theater Workshop."

Firefighters, ambulance crews and the bomb squad were dispatched. It was May 31, Memorial Day, and the neighborhood was decked out in American flags and bustling with block parties and backyard cookouts. The police searched the backyard of the house where the blast had occurred, blowing off the garage roof. Outside, walkie-talkie chatter competed with questions from reporters and neighbors. The news was grim: the injured man had suffered burns over 70 percent of his body, and three others were treated at the scene. The authorities suspect that a cloud of fuel ignited when the lights were turned on in the garage. Earlier pictures in the series are at nytimes.com/lens."
2010-07-21T00:00:00Z,"JERUSALEM -- The director of the Israel Museum was leading a visitor to see a provocative contemporary sculpture of a naked African youth when, stepping over protective cloths and around an exhibit of late Canaanite sarcophagi, he nearly ran into four workmen carrying the million-year-old horns of a wild bull. The horns are the oldest items in the museum's collection, and something about the juxtaposition of contemporary social consciousness, ancient ceremony and prehistoric beast summed up the museum's refocused mission as it completes a three-year, $100 million renewal. As described by the director, James S. Snyder, the museum offers a series of unexpected aesthetic links across cultures and their histories, like the way 2,000-year-old carved ritual cups that are on view in the museum near the Dead Sea Scrolls are somehow evocative of Brancusi."

Then, you pour it with food that has a hot weather vibe. Though steak is what these sturdy wines demand, slabs of thick porterhouse or rib-eye on the grill will do fine for the season, and for Tuscany. To give these steaks sunglasses and a deck chair, a salad goes alongside. The quintessential Tuscan salad is panzanella, made with garden vegetables and pieces of stale bread in a vinaigrette. Taking advantage of a lighted grill, this version of panzanella combines grilled fennel with cucumbers and olives. I even grilled the bread.

He has been called ''the poet of the common man,'' and in 1994 he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. But his reputation as a hellion was born early. After hopping his first freight train at 10, he was jailed 17 times in his youth for crimes including car theft. His life changed forever, he has said, when, as an inmate at San Quentin, he heard Johnny Cash perform there on New Year's Day 1959. Now 73, Mr. Haggard is touring on behalf of ''I Am What I Am,'' his first solo album since ''The Bluegrass Sessions'' in 2007. Reviewing the album in The New York Times, Jon Caramanica said Mr. Haggard tackled ''songs for which age is an asset, not a liability,'' adding, ''Once again Mr. Haggard is an outlaw.'' This ''American Masters'' presentation from Gandulf Hennig follows Mr. Haggard across three years, from life on his California ranch to his concert tours.

What, then, is that moral self that is there 'before' the Darwinian self, whose conscience must be appeased, needing to believe that it is moved by altruism or disinterested love?"""

Devotees of Tokyo street style, with its weirdly sexualized, faintly sinister lure, included Crystal Lonnquist, (bottom, with fan), showing off a lacy scarf and a glove that fastened up the wrist like a corset; and Seiko Dee, daftly subversive in a midi-blouse and mini (left), dressed as Haruhi Suzumiya, his anime idol."

The woman dipped a purple scoop into her bowl and hefted out globules of tofu chocolate pudding spiked with cayenne, and - as she had already done to half the garden party - poured the viscous dessert into the injured guest's mouth. ''This will make it all better,'' she said."

2010-07-22T00:00:00Z,"Last week, workers at the World Trade Center site discovered a 30-foot section of an 18th-century ship, buried about 20 to 30 feet below street level. It's a remarkable find, but hardly a first for New York. Since the late 1970s, hundreds of archaeological digs around the city have uncovered thousands of artifacts and structures -- each of which have helped to shape our understanding of New York's history. The Op-Ed editors asked 12 local archaeologists to share their most memorable discoveries. Tannery Foley Square Maps show that in the 18th century the Collect Pond, which sat on the north side of Foley Square but was filled in around 1815, was home to the city's tanning industry -- but there were no artifacts to prove it. In 1995, though, I determined that subtle changes in the soil composition under the square were probably caused by rotted bark and organic mats, items that were used in the tanning process. Subsequent excavations yielded goat horns from discarded carcasses and tanning hooks, evidence that tanneries had in fact been on the site. -- JOSEPH SCHULDENREIN, archaeological consultant"

The ban applied only to the German charity, not the Turkish one. The article also misstated the price paid by the Turkish charity for the lead flotilla vessel, the Mavi Marmara.

2010-07-23T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M (Flix) THE 400 BLOWS (1959) Most critics consider François Truffaut's semiautobiographical portrait, which won him the best director award at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, to be a masterpiece and a landmark New Wave film. About an adolescent boy, Antoine (Jean-Pierre Léaud, above), who finds himself in trouble at school and at home, the film is the first of five movies that Truffaut shot over 20 years about Antoine as he grows older. Praising the cycle, Vincent Canby said in The New York Times that it is ''unlike anything else in cinema.'' 7:35 P.M. (WAM) THE FRESHMAN (1990) Marlon Brando sends up his role in ''The Godfather'' with a rare comedic performance as Carmine Sabatini, a mobster who hires Clark Kellogg (Matthew Broderick, above right, with Mr. Brando), a New York University film student, to make sure an endangered Komodo dragon gets to a $350,000-a-plate dinner where it will be served as the entrée.

""A Contract with God,"" a graphic novel composed of four interlocking stories set in the tenements of the Bronx during the Depression, will be written and produced by Darren Dean. The semi-autobiographical work originally had trouble finding a publisher, as Eisner, who died in 2005,  wrote in an essay for The New York Times Book Review in 1990: ""It was, in format and style, as great a departure from the comic-book conventions as I could master. It was the story of one man's perception of his relationship with God. The book was rejected by the major publishing houses but was ultimately published in 1978 by a small, now defunct publisher, Baronet Books, which got it into establishment bookstores. It got no reviews, neither was it an instant commercial success. The response from adults who chanced on it, however, was warm and encouraging. I had, at last, connected with a serious adult audience. Ultimately it acquired a word-of-mouth following and remains in print to this day."

2010-07-24T00:00:00Z,"SUMMER is the time for travel, adventure -- and getting lost. Losing your way in the wilderness is one thing. Even without a compass, experienced hikers can figure out where they are by following nature's signs indicating north, south, east or west -- the direction of the wind, for example, or tell-tale marks on rocks and trees that show prevailing wind patterns. But people get lost in strange cities, too. And while this is rarely as dangerous as it is in the wilderness, it can still be an inconvenience. Fortunately, the same skills that have allowed adventurers to find their way into and out of the woods for centuries can also help a wayward traveler tame an unfamiliar town. The ancient art of natural navigation is the opposite of using GPS: it is slow and imprecise. But it can also be hugely enjoyable."

2010-07-24T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (Cinemax) (500) DAYS OF SUMMER (2009) Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, above, with Zooey Deschanel) is an ''unapologetic believer in true love, soul mates and other touchstones of greeting card mythology (and romantic comedy ideology),'' A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Summer Finn (Ms. Deschanel), he said, is ''skeptical of such notions and refuses to promise commitment or even consistency, but she does seem to want more and more of Tom's company, and this leads him to believe that her carefully maintained barriers to intimacy are beginning to fall.'' That pretty much sums up the romance between these two seemingly made-for-each-other semi-hipsters, whose breakup is told in scrambled chronology, with the occasional musical number. Mr. Scott went on to describe this film from Marc Webb, who directed music videos for Miley Cyrus and My Chemical Romance, as a ''shimmering soap bubble,'' a movie ''that is, for the most part, as mopily, winningly seductive as the Regina Spektor songs on the soundtrack and at its best as unexpectedly lovely as the views of Los Angeles captured by Mr. Webb and his director of photography, Eric Steelberg.'' 10 A.M.

In one set of experiments, researchers attached sensors to the parts of monkeys' brains responsible for visual pattern recognition. The monkeys were then taught to respond to a cue by choosing to look at one of two patterns. Computers reading the sensors were able to register the decision a fraction of a second before the monkeys' eyes turned to the pattern. As the monkeys were not deliberating, but rather reacting to visual stimuli, researchers were able to plausibly claim that the computer could successfully predict the monkeys' reaction. In other words, the computer was reading the monkeys' minds and knew before they did what their decision would be."

No other driver had ever achieved anything like it. But like so many record-breaking sportsmen, Schumacher came across looking like a cold, calculating, ruthless, armor-skinned robot -- with more than a dash of arrogance. So bored and disgusted did many fans of auto racing become with Schumacher's domination that they greeted the German's retirement at the end of 2006 with a sigh of relief. So when at the age of 41 and after three years away from the sport he announced that he would return this year to drive for the Mercedes team -- which bought the reigning champion Brawn team -- many fans said, ''Oh no, not again!''"

2010-07-25T00:00:00Z,"HOLDERNESS--Algernon Sidney, Jr.,died of a sudden heart attack on Sunday evening, July 11, 2010 at his home in Bellaire, Texas. A funeral was held at the Oakland Cemetery in Fordyce, Arkansas on Saturday, July 17. He is survived by his loving daughters Claire Crockett Holderness of Brooklyn, New York and Julia Simms Holderness of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and by his grandson Soroush Crockett Vakhshoori, also of Cambridge. He is remembered by his cousin George Malcolm Holderness, of New York, New York. He was preceded in death by his parents, Algernon Sidney Holderness, Sr. and Mary Elizabeth Crockett Holderness of Radnor, Pennsylvania. He was the great-great-great-grandson of the frontiersman David ""Davy"" Crockett. Born in Wilmington, Delaware on March 31, 1938, Mr. Holderness spent his childhood and early youth in Providence, Rhode Island; Bellaire, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; and Radnor, Pennsylvania. A lifelong Yale man, he received his BA in History magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, from Yale College in 1959 and his L.L.B. cum laude, Order of the Coif, in 1962 from Yale Law School, where he was a member of the Board of Editors of the Yale Law Journal. He garnered a prestigious federal clerkship under Judge Thomas W. Swan of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Mr. Holderness subsequently specialized in private financing, practicing for many years as a partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy in New York, and later as a partner at AndrewsKurth LLP, first in New York, and then in Houston. At the time of his death, he was Of Counsel to AndrewsKurth. He was an active member of the American Bar Association, the TriBar Association, the American Law Institute, and the American College of Investment Counsel, which he served as President. His intellectual passion for the law translated into editorial work for publications by the American Bar Association and Tribar Association, and into publications of his own, most notably a Legal Opinion Letters Formbook, co-authored with Brooke Wunnicke, now about to appear in its third edition. In more recent years, he took up teaching as an Adjunct Professor at the South Texas College of Law. Of his work there, one student wrote, ""When Professor Holderness talks, I listen."" Mr. Holderness devoted what free time he had to his family and public service. He served on the boards of the Brooklyn Heights Association and the Girl Scout Council of Greater New York, and the New York and national boards of the YMCA. After returning to Texas in his later years, he focused his efforts on serving the Presbyterian Church. He was a church Elder, a Stephen Minister, and Clerk of Session. Music was another lifelong passion, especially choral music: he sang bass in the Yale Glee Club, and was an active participant in productions of the Blue Hill Troupe, a Gilbert and Sullivan Society in New York, the annual holiday musicals at Milbank, Tweed, and his church choir in Bellaire. Mr. Holderness was a brilliant man who set high standards for himself and expected the same of those around him. At the same time he had a tremendous sense of humor and took delight in life's absurdities. He literally could not stop moving - he was happiest when he was doing two or three things at a time. At his fiftieth college reunion he looked forward not only to reconnecting with his oldest friends, but to making new friends as well. Had he not experienced physical difficulty in his final weeks, he would have attended his fifty-fifth high school reunion as well, in Kansas City. His zest for life was strong until the end; his final day began with church and ended with a fine dinner. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, August 14 at two o'clock at ChristChurch Presbyterian, 5000 Bellaire Avenue, Bellaire TX. All are welcome. In lieu of flowers, please consider a contribution in his memory to Houston Public Radio, kuhf.org: (713) 743-8443."

The New York Civil Liberties Union, which culled a list of 139 such districts from hundreds of registration forms and instructions posted online, has not found any children turned away for lack of immigration paperwork. But it warned in a letter to the state's education commissioner on Wednesday that the requirements listed by many registrars, however free of discriminatory intent, ''will inevitably discourage families from enrolling in school for fear that they would be reported to federal immigration authorities.''

Methane gas was found seeping up two miles away, but scientists concluded it was a natural occurrence. With the well apparently holding tight under the pressure, Thad W.

Indeed, it is why the caring industry began its exponential growth during the conservative 1950s rather than in the liberal 1960s ... To some degree the caring industry had no choice but to intervene. The mental health crisis and mass loneliness were revolutionary events that spawned real turmoil. People found themselves with more emotional problems than ever, and no one to talk to. It was an intolerable situation. Thus, the creation of the caring ethos, the caring industry, and the thousands of caring professionals who define it. Forty years ago, in his now-classic book The Triumph of the Therapeutic, sociologist Philip Rieff sensed that a great change had come over the West. A 'therapeutic culture' grounded in psychotherapy, he wrote, had replaced the 'ethos' of traditional society ... What Rieff had observed were the first stirrings of a new social order, one that would rest on a nation-spanning network of caring professionals. Today, countless institutions and millions of people are dependent to one degree or another on the caring industry. Therapy is no longer just a 'culture.' In the form of professional caring, it has become our way of life."""

2010-07-26T00:00:00Z,"SWINSKY--Morton. Pioneering bond trader, art collector and multiple Tony Award-winning Broadway producer - died June 19, of prostate cancer. He was 75. Swinsky produced numerous plays and musicals, beginning with 'Eubie' and including hits such as 'Spamalot,' 'Spring Awakening,' David Mamet's 'Race,' 'Guys and Dolls' (Tony), 'Chicago' (Tony), 'Annie Get Your Gun' (Tony),'The Music Man,' 'The Who's Tommy,' 'Hamlet,' 'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,' 'Grey Gardens,' 'Jersey Boys' (Tony), 'A View From the Bridge,' 'Hairspray' (Tony), 'The History Boys,' 'Billy Elliot' (Tony) and, most recently, 'Fela!,' and 'The Addams Family.' Swinsky was the recipient of film and television awards (AFI, Emmy) for 'You Can Count On Me,' 'Boys Don't Cry' and the concert version of 'Sweeney Todd.' With all these successes, Mort seemed devoid of ego and hubris. Backing a quality play or musical is what brought him pleasure. That and collecting art. Recognized by The National Sculpture Society, Swinsky was a patron to artists mostly in the Figurative Arts. Born to immigrant parents of Russian Jewish descent, Swinsky was raised in the Inwood section of Manhattan. While at City College night school, where he met his wife Florence Swinsky (Pincus), he pursued a job with CJ Devine and Co., where his mind, memory, and ability to predict value propelled him to the top of his field. When Merrill Lynch consolidated operations with CJ Devine, the ""Devine Boys"" created a high percentage of Merrill's revenue, and were granted the autonomy to run Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc., with Swinsky as Executive Vice President. As a leader and pioneer in the trading of government bonds, Swinsky and his team left in 1980 to join William E. Pollock & Co and in 1990, the ""Udder Guys"" joined Fuji Securities. He retired from that firm as President. It was during his successful tenure on Wall Street that his eye for talent brought him into the world of Broadway and other arts. Mort touched so many people in his lifetime. He will be remembered and missed. He is survived by Florence, their two daughters Karen and Dana, and five grandchildren, Nikola, Dante and Thanos Carouso and Connor and Harry Cantelmo. A Memorial will be held Monday, July 26 at the Lotos Club, 5 East 66 St, 6:30 -8:30. Additional remembrances can be shared at legacy.com. Contributions in Mort's memory may be made to The National Sculpture Society, and The New York Theater Workshop."

Because Al's putt is on the same line as Ben's, Ben decides to stand on the other side of the hole to watch Al's putt. Al makes the putt, and Ben also makes his after seeing the break in Al's putt. Carl's ball is on a sprinkler head in the rough by the green. He decides to take relief but goes to get a different club. To save time, Dave lifts Carl's ball and drops it within a club length of the nearest point of relief. Carl chips his ball onto the green five feet directly behind Dave's ball. Carl tells Dave to stand on the extension of his line of putt behind the ball to watch his putt. Carl makes his putt, and Dave, having seen the break, also makes his."

If 105 is a typical score for you, you are likely to have about eight awful shots per round, while someone who shoots around 80 will probably have just two. That's according to Mark Broadie, a Columbia University professor who has spent years analyzing data from average golfers. O.K., so we know we're inconsistent, but here's the thing: many average golfers also follow up one dreadful shot with an equally dreadful shot. Why? Because we're frustrated and not thinking."

His extensive published works included Ezekiel's Oracles Against Egypt, two volumes of commentaries on Jeremiah in the Old Testament Message series, a commentary on ""Ezekiel"" for the New Jerome Biblical Commentary and almost one hundred articles and reviews in leading biblical journals such as the Catholic Biblical Quarterly, the Journal of Biblical Literature, and Vetus Testamentum. His most popular work is Reading the Old Testament: An Introduction, published by Paulist Press in 1985. It has been the standard introduction to the Hebrew scriptures in numerous colleges and seminaries in English. Lawrence Boadt was born in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, CA, and grew up in the Paulist parish there. He entered the Paulists in 1962 and studied at St. Paul's College in Washington, DC. Following his ordination in 1969, he did graduate work at Catholic University, obtaining degrees in Semitic languages and theology. From 197276 he was a student at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, where he obtained a licentiate and doctorate in sacred scripture. Father Boadt was a man of boundless energy and enthusiasm for whom the classroom and writing were only a part of his achievements. He often conducted tours of the Holy Land. His favorite tour was through Turkey and Greece in the footsteps of St. Paul. He was the biblical expert on the team established by Walter Burghardt, SJ, which regularly ran workshops/retreats on preaching for diocesan priests. His incredible gift of clarity in his biblical presentations won him numerous admirers. For all the years he lived in Washington, he taught a weekly Bible class to a group of laity, professional people, and government officials. In 1998 he was named president of Paulist Press and served in that post until his final illness. Since 1975 he had been the scripture editor of the Press. As president, he oversaw publication of up to 80 books a year. Once again he brought out numbers of quality books on the Bible. His final contribution was the highly acclaimed Catholic edition of a Lectio Divina Bible. Father Boadt served as president of the Catholic Biblical Association of America and was active in major Catholic and Protestant biblical organizations. He was president of the Stimulus Foundation in recent years which was created to foster dialogue and mutual respect between Christians and Jews through publications dedicated to those goals. ""Larry,"" as he was affectionately known by his many friends, was a convivial person who enjoyed being with people. He was never a reclusive scholar but always available for a good time. His unusual work ethic never excluded time with his Paulist brethren, among whom he was extremely popular. Plans are under way to create a fitting memorial to this highly gifted and dedicated priest who did so much to bring people across the U.S. to a deeper understanding of God's word as it comes to us in the Bible. A funeral Mass of Resurrection will be offered at 10am on Wednesday, July 28, 2010, at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle, 60th Street and Columbus Avenue in New York City. Visitation and wake will take place at the church from 2-5pm and 7-9pm on Tuesday, July 27. Immediately following the funeral, interment will take place in the Paulist Fathers' section of St. Thomas the Apostle Church Cemetery in Oak Ridge, NJ."
