The documentary, called “Don’t You Forget About Me,” was made by Matt Austin Sadowski, a Canadian director and actor, and three filmmaking colleagues, Michael Facciolo, Kari Hollend and Lenny Panzer. It combines footage from road trips spent seeking Mr. Hughes, the writer and director of 1980s teen comedies like “The Breakfast Club,” “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and “Sixteen Candles,” with interviews of stars from these films, including Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy and Mia Sara. After Mr. Hughes died on Thursday of a heart attack, Mr. Austin Sadowski said, he started receiving interview requests from the news media the next day.

2009-08-11T23:59:28Z,"An article in Skeletal Radiology, a well-respected journal, created something of a sensation in Europe last year. It reported that researchers from Danube Hospital in Austria examined the knees of marathon runners using M.R.I. imaging, before and after the 1997 Vienna marathon. Ten years later, they scanned the same runners' knees again. The results were striking. ""No major new internal damage in the knee joints of marathon runners was found after a 10-year interval,"" the researchers reported. Only one of the participants had a knee that was truly a mess, and he'd quit running before the 1997 marathon (but had been included in that study anyway). His 1997 knee M.R.I. revealed cartilage lesions, swelling and other abnormalities. In the years that followed, the knee became worse, showing augmented tissue damage and more serious lesions. His exam prompted the researchers to wonder whether he would have been better off persisting as a runner, because, as they speculate, ""continuous exercise is protective, rather than destructive,"" to knees."

It was August 1969, and the older kids, we kept hearing for a week, were leaving the island for a music festival in a place called Woodstock. Josie and I were waiting for her older brother to come along and drive us back to Sconset. We were 13. The Bonnie station wagon was parked in front of the Bosun's Locker, a mysterious place to me then, the last bar on Main Street, and a young woman announced (with some hysteria, I thought at the time) that she and her boyfriend were going to get married. Then and there. The woman kept flitting in and out of the bar, looking, I guess, for her groom. It all seemed perfectly normal, even to a 13-year-old, but for some reason I have chosen, as E.B. White would say, to put it away in lavender. Somewhere in a shoebox at home there is a picture of me on Alter Rock, in a cut-off jean skirt and faded blue flannel shirt. That is my chief sartorial memory of that period, but what else would be contained in a memory from then?"

Named after Mr. Jackson’s planned 50-date engagement in London, the film is to include scenes of him rehearsing at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, along with a career retrospective and interviews with friends and collaborators, and parts of it will be in 3-D, the announcement said. Sony paid $60 million to make the film, part of a deal involving the studio, the Jackson estate and AEG Live, the concert promoter that shot the rehearsals. Until permanent executors are confirmed, Judge Mitchell Beckloff of Los Angeles County Superior Court must approve deals made by the interim administrators, John G. Branca and John McClain. The two were named as executors in Mr. Jackson’s will. ... The Associated Press reported that Mr. Jackson will be honored in Vienna with an all-star concert at the Schönbrunn Palace. The event was announced Monday by the promoter World Awards Media G.m.b.H. A date was not set, but tickets for the concert, which will take place at an outdoor stage shaped like a crown, are to go on sale Aug. 20. The promoters said Jermaine Jackson would appear at the concert “to celebrate the life of his brother and perform some of Michael’s unforgettable songs,” along with other members of the Jackson family."

The music will be a mixture of familiar opera music and original compositions by Helen Porter, and the finished work will be performed Sept. 4 through 6.

Stephan J. Kramer, the general secretary of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said the group favored the publication of a new edition of “Mein Kampf” with scholarly commentaries that would educate future generations on the evils of Nazism.

The book, first published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, has been banned in Germany since 1945, and the Bavarian government holds the copyright on it until 2015. A spokesman for the Bavarian government told The Independent, “We won’t lift the ban, as it may play straight into the hands of the far right.

There's also the dilapidated, 58-foot-long fiberglass Big Eye run by Chris Hanson of Wanchese, N.C., and owned by his fiancée, as well as the Frances Anne, a 72-foot-long, forward-housed boat run by Chris Kleme and several New Jersey surfer dudes.

Researchers speculate that one reason for the possible increase in cancer risk is that immigrants quickly adopt new, less healthy dietary and lifestyle habits, like increased alcohol consumption, after moving to the United States."

It might be a bit more surprising to discover that the painter was also one of the most influential scientists of his day. The artist was Ernst Haeckel, the German zoologist best known today for his infamous and mistaken declaration that ''ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,'' meaning that the developmental stages an organism passes through are a kind of instant replay of its species' evolutionary history."

The expansion would have created new exhibition space for the extensive collection of Native American artifacts that the Autry gained when it merged its Museum of the American West, endowed by the cowboy-singer Gene Autry, with the Southwest Museum of the American Indian in 2003. The Southwest Museum was formerly housed in a landmark white adobe building northeast of downtown that was damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The Southwest Museum’s collections were later found to be suffering from severe neglect. Neighborhood groups wanted a commitment to keep the building as a functioning museum. But John L. Gray, the Autry president, said in a letter to museum supporters Tuesday that the cost of and delays in the approval process for its multi-campus plan were no longer supportable. The museum said it will continue to use its existing facilities, both in Griffith Park and at Mount Washington, for exhibitions."

2009-08-12T16:42:22Z,"LOS ANGELES — The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences reversed course on Wednesday and said it would present all 28 awards during its live broadcast on CBS on Sept. 20, eliminating a plan to pre-tape some of the awards that drew stiff opposition from television writers and cable networks. The Academy had planned to prerecord and edit the presentation of eight awards to allow for more time to celebrate shows that are popular with the public but which might not have been nominated. The plan was to try to boost ratings after viewers told the Academy last year that the awards focus too much on shows that are unfamiliar to the public. Members of at least two unions — the Writers Guild of America, West, and the Directors Guild of America – opposed the plan, as did HBO, which usually dominates the movie and miniseries categories that were scheduled for pre-taping. The academy also faced the prospect that the unions would force it to pay substantial fees for the clips of television shows it uses during the broadcast. In a statement, an academy official said it reversed the plan “to mend relationships within the television community.”"

""'Rad' never seems to escape our left coast lingo,"" says Rick Klotz, the line's founder and designer. ""And combining it with 'warriors' made sense because the guys I surf with and I felt like we were warriors in search of anything rad, whether it be a party, waves, girls or beer. I always tell people we're conducting a W.O.R. on mundane surf wear."" Weapons in the W.O.R. arsenal include pastel T-shirts (Klotz is partial to the Gidget one above), seersucker shorts and, for fall, wool muscle pants, a sort of trouser-length version of board shorts. ""I was wearing them last night with dress shoes,"" Klotz says. ""And you know, for the West Coast, they looked pretty fancy."""

That allegation was attributed to &#8220;people close to the Jackson family who asked not to be named,&#8221; and in later copies of the newspaper the original article reported that a spokesman for the executors denied it.

The academy had planned to record and edit the presentation of eight awards to allow for more time to celebrate shows that are popular with the public but that might not have been nominated. The plan was to try to increase ratings after viewers told the academy last year that the awards focus too much on shows that are unfamiliar to the public. Members of at least two unions &#151; the Writers Guild of America, West and the Directors Guild of America &#151; opposed the plan, as did HBO, which usually dominates the movie and mini-series categories that were scheduled for taping. The academy also faced the prospect that the unions would force it to pay substantial fees for the clips of television shows it uses during the broadcast. In a statement an academy official said it reversed the plan &#8220;to mend relationships within the television community.&#8221;."

The expansion would have created new exhibition space for the extensive collection of American Indian artifacts that the Autry gained when it merged its Museum of the American West, endowed by the cowboy singer and actor Gene Autry, with the Southwest Southwest the American Indian in 2003. The Southwest Museum was formerly housed in a landmark white adobe building that was damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, and its collections were later found to be suffering from severe neglect. Neighborhood groups wanted a commitment to keep the building as a functioning museum. But John L. Gray, the Autry president, said in a letter to museum supporters Tuesday that the cost of and delays in the approval process for its plan were no longer supportable. The museum said it would continue to use its existing facilities, both in Griffith Park and at Mount Washington, for exhibitions."

Once again Mr. Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;Number Ones&#8221; (Epic) was the best-selling album in the United States last week, with 98,000 sales, according to Nielsen SoundScan. His other titles, particularly &#8220;Thriller&#8221; and &#8220;The Essential Michael Jackson,&#8221; also continue to rack up significant sales; in total, about 3.7 million Jackson albums have been sold since his death on June 25. The best-selling new album last week was &#8220;Live on the Inside&#8221; by the country duo Sugarland, which was released by Mercury Nashville through an exclusive retail deal with Wal-Mart. It sold 76,000 copies, enough to reach No. 1 on Billboard&#8217;s standard album chart, the Billboard 200. (Most Jackson titles are too old to qualify for it.) The next five spots on the chart are a photo finish, with each title scoring between 44,000 and 45,000 sales.

Peter Sollett directed the ''idiomatically spot-on screenplay by Lorene Scafaria,'' adapted from the novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''The movie is so friendly that you may wish for a little more conflict: higher emotional stakes, riskier jokes, a touch of danger in the night air,'' he wrote, adding, ''Why begrudge them their fun, or wish premature heartache upon them?

In the 1980s, he ranked among Nancy Reagan’s favorite designers (she wore Galanos to all her husband’s inaugurations). And while he officially retired in 1998, he shows no signs of falling out of fashion anytime soon: the model Amber Valletta wore a canary-yellow vintage Galanos gown to this year’s Costume Institute gala.

Juicy Couture, which the two best friends started in 1996 with $200, was the tracksuit heard round the world. Today the clothing line includes accessories, fragrances, canine fashions, even a Maclaren stroller — all made in a spirit of fun. “Juicy is definitely autobiographical,” said Pamela, a former costume designer. “We have infused the brand with us: with love, happiness, color.” With about 100 stores from L.A. to Dubai, the Juicy girls wanted to create something more personal. The result is their new collection of tailored, vintage-inspired outerwear and clever knits called Bird by Juicy Couture — “Juicy’s older sister,” explained Gela, a former actress. They say Bird is for them, not the mainstream, but why fight it? “It blows our mind that Juicy is part of popular culture,” Pamela said. “When we started, we were wacky thrift-shop girls.”."

The industrial designer and architect Ron Arad, who founded his One Off Ltd. studio in London in 1981, was developing a look that eventually became his signature: curvaceous, relatively unfurniture-like forms. “Ron Arad: No Discipline,” the first major United States retrospective of the designer’s work, is now on view at the Museum of Modern Art, where it runs through Oct. 19. The title refers to Arad’s joyful promiscuity with materials but also winks at a stubborn refusal to play by the rules. (He famously designed a stereo made of rough concrete and a chair made of two seats from a Rover P6 2000, a metal frame and a few Kee Klamps.) Keeping with the theory that no trend ever comes back the same way twice, Arad’s Big Easy armchair, with its linebacker shoulders, has enjoyed more than one revival but never in exactly the same fashion. The painted fiberglass New Orleans chair (left) came out in 1999; the latest incarnation, a stainless-steel duo called Even the Odd Balls?, is also in the show. [?][?][?] ALIX BROWNE."

When a member of Saddam Hussein’s regime referred to her (while she was the United States ambassador to the United Nations) as a serpent, Albright donned a snake pin to a meeting with an Iraqi official. For Nelson Mandela, she wore a zebra pin.

Johnson and Opening Ceremony were sticklers for historical verisimilitude — they had the original fabrics replicated, so the rib knit skirts are superbly stretchy; the rosebud prints, a Betsey signature, look like they blossomed this morning. Of course, we know that all of these are her precious babies, but if she had to pick a favorite, which would it be? Johnson is unable to decide between a peplum frock — “It represents my career, my life, it’s what I’ve stood for” — and the shaggy faux fur jacket over satin spandex pants, because “that’s really what I always want to look like.” Don’t we all?

With her daring collection, Ovitz, 26, reworks the cliché of “Hollywood glamour” by substituting chain mail for chinchilla and leather for lace. Deployed on a mostly black-and-white palette (an hommage to a Jasper Johns minimalist “White Flag” painting that hangs in her father Michael’s collection), these touches lend modernity and just a hint of menace to pieces that are otherwise classic to the core — from sleek, skinny jodhpurs to slouchy cashmere tunics. Small wonder that her logo should feature two crossed riding crops, suggesting the improbable intersection of bondage-inflected high jinks and horsy good breeding. This pairing, Ovitz explains, undoes the idea of feminine allure as necessarily “overdressed and frilly.” So is the Ovitz girl the femme fatale for these harder, darker times? Perhaps. But the designer warns that her goal for spring 2010 is to “use more color, because people need to feel hopeful.” Spoken like a true daughter of Hollywood. [?][?][?] CAROLINE WEBER."

His early images for Harper’s Bazaar have a reportage quality that goes beyond clothes; even mid-’70s photos of Jerry Hall in the Soviet Union tell a larger story. “He makes our lovely American ladies look like duchesses and indeed, on occasion, he has been known to make a duchess appear a lady,” wrote the editor in chief of Town Country in 1987. With “Norman Parkinson: A Very British Glamour,” by Louise Baring (Rizzoli), Americans can rediscover his gifts. [?][?][?] CHRISTINE MUHLKE."

But when a career-threatening injury forced the 22-year-old off the courts, she hit the sketchbooks. The result is a surprisingly cool accessories collection for Cole Haan, which is owned by her apparel sponsor, Nike. The three-time Grand Slam winner says she drew upon her own peripatetic lifestyle for the shoes ($138 to $328) and handbags ($248 to $428). And while Sharapova’s aware that not all women her age travel as much as she does, they still “juggle a lot of concerns, so comfort and adaptability are key.” Spoken like a true garmento.

2009-08-16T00:00:00Z,"Nowhere is the transformative power of fashion more visible than on the backs of celebrities. Thanks to the proliferation of tabloid TV, magazines, Web sites and blogs whose modus operandi is to track every star-torial step and misstep, not to mention the discriminate propagation of celebrities themselves (um, who is Melissa Rycroft, anyway, and why do we care what she’s wearing to the deli?), what may have started out as a symbiotic creative relationship between designers and actresses has exploded into a fashion-industrial complex. But even in the days before Rachel Zoe and her ilk, the exchange of gown for publicity was not necessarily a smooth one. Hubert de Givenchy was famously deflated when a dark-haired gamine first waltzed through his doors. He was expecting the great Katharine Hepburn, not Audrey, then unknown. Fortunately, he got over himself — and we all know how that story turned out. In fact, there are fewer thrills greater for a fledgling designer than to see someone famous wear his or her clothes by choice (and possibly even pay for them). For Roberto Cavalli, it was spying Brigitte Bardot in his silk chiffon caftan in St.-Tropez back in 1979. “That was the beginning of my brand philosophy,” Cavalli says. For Giorgio Armani, it was Lauren Hutton, who according to the designer still hangs on to her vintage Armani from the ’70s. John Galliano’s first brush with fame was Diana Ross. “She was not only the first celebrity,” he says, “but also one of my first clients when she bought about eight pieces from my 1984 St. Martins graduate collection. It was one of the most exciting yet insane moments of my life.” For Isaac Mizrahi, it was the day he got a call from Bergdorf’s informing him that Liza Minnelli had just bought an outfit. “She came to my studio and said, ‘Darling’ — I didn’t even know her and she called me darling — ‘I saw this from t"

You walked below 34th and . . . wait, wasn’t there a store over here? The owner had just shut it down and was standing on the sidewalk looking at it. He saw me staring, processing the void. “Wanna see?” he asked. Stripped walls, wiring hanging like the Gorgon’s hair from the ceiling. That’s when the smell of the recession kicked in: old plaster dust first, then concrete (Gaultier’s Puissance Deux without the vanilla). Then emptiness: the absence of people, of circulated air, of the layers of plastic, fiberboard and carpeting with which we surround ourselves."

Naomi Campbell is the muse behind 3 L’Impératrice (the Empress), while Claudia Schiffer embodies the more subtle 18 La Lune (the Moon).

Which suits his clientele — fashion and social types like Alba Clemente, Mirella Petteni, Princess Alessandra Borghese and Sasha Pivovarova — just fine. An exhibition of his work, scheduled for next month at David Gill Galleries in London, might garner him a few more fans, but commerce isn’t his endgame. “I only make jewels when a material inspires me,” he says. The fashion historian Bronwyn Cosgrave, who curated the exhibit, is intrigued by the surreal quality of many of Scialanga’s designs. “Luigi’s jewels are similar in attitude to the ones Jean Cocteau produced for Schiaparelli,” she says. “The craftsmanship is impeccable, but there’s a free-form spirit that makes his work highly original and highly covetable.” [?][?][?] SANDRA BALLENTINE."

Here, Lorenz’s Fenton and Fallon costume collections and her new fine jewelry line share space with an outpost of Sully Fair, the online vintage dealer that offers exquisite pieces from Balenciaga, Chanel, YSL, Dior and Stephen Sprouse. “We were going for Sigourney Weaver’s town house in ‘Working Girl,’ ” Lorenz says of the mishmash of merchandise and décor. “But it’s more like an ‘80s teenager inherited her grandparents’ Park Avenue apartment and turned it on its ear.” Go to danalorenz.com.

2009-08-16T00:00:00Z,"EXPLORING BYBLOS, A UNESCOWORLD HERITAGE SITE NEAR BEIRUT, LEBANON, MARCH 26, 2009 Angela Hartwick, a 31-year-old Canadian online art gallery director based in Dubai, walks among the ancient ruins. ''Byblos is this crazy historical site, and yet it's a stone's throw away from this whole suburban sprawl, some of which suffered so much damage and destruction in 2006. So Lebanon has both modern ruins and ancient ruins. And its culture blends rough-edged Arabic ways with refined French ways. Walking through Beirut, in a span of 20 minutes, you can go from a Shiite Muslim stronghold to a really affluent French neighborhood. This kind of contrast spreads across the people as well. There are strict traditional Muslims, and then there are women in miniskirts and enhanced breasts. As I walked through Byblos, I kept thinking how humanity keeps reinventing itself. You're standing there in thousands of years of history, but then you see different eras cropping up. You see a 12th-century castle, and then you see a building blown out from the 2006 war. It's all sort of there in the same picture.''"

2009-08-16T00:00:00Z,"Mosquito levels in Westchester County remained normal for May and much of June, but then started spiking in tandem with the rain. The county has 20 trapping sites, with each trap capturing about 40 mosquitoes a night, at least twice the usual amount, according to Frank Guido, assistant commissioner for public health protection in the county's Department of Health. The county's 70,000 catch basins have been treated with larvicide, Mr. Guido said. So far, no mosquito batches have tested positive for the West Nile virus. ''But that's likely to change in short order,'' Mr. Guido said, ''based on past history. Through late August, more mosquitoes with West Nile virus are likely to appear.''"

Still, the Fed cautioned that the recovery would be slow and would pick up speed only gradually in 2010. Unemployment is also likely to continue to climb and remain high through the next year.

2009-08-16T00:00:00Z,"HAPPY DAYS I've been skateboarding seriously for more than 20 years, and while I never met Andy Kessler, I know his life story. Most skaters over the age of 25 do. Raised on West 71st Street, Kessler started skateboarding when he was 11. This was in the 1970s, a time when skateboarding was so alien to New York City that he had to mail-order his gear from California. Significance-wise, think: Prometheus and fire. When other kids saw Kessler carving around the Upper West Side on his board -- which would've been three inches wide with metal wheels -- they followed, and just like that, the East Coast skate scene was born. It was gritty, dirty and beautiful, the shadow-version of the breezy West Coast surf-style. It still is. The current state of skateboarding -- the ubiquitous television presence, the department-store displays of designer skater apparel -- is roughly to Kessler's brand of skating what a country club swimming pool is to the ocean. His was a raw, aggressive way of skating, fast and slashing and explosive. He fell a lot, bled and got hurt a lot. But there was also a grace to it, a power and soulfulness that often gets lost in the flashy spectacle of televised competitions."

2009-08-16T00:00:00Z,"An article in Skeletal Radiology, a well-respected journal, created something of a sensation in Europe last year. It reported that researchers from Danube Hospital in Austria examined the knees of marathon runners using M.R.I. imaging, before and after the 1997 Vienna marathon. Ten years later, they scanned the same runners' knees again. The results were striking. ''No major new internal damage in the knee joints of marathon runners was found after a 10-year interval,'' the researchers reported. Only one of the participants had a knee that was truly a mess, and he'd quit running before the 1997 marathon (but had been included in that study anyway). His 1997 knee M.R.I. revealed cartilage lesions, swelling and other abnormalities. In the years that followed, the knee became worse, showing augmented tissue damage and more serious lesions. His exam prompted the researchers to wonder whether he would have been better off persisting as a runner, because, as they speculate, ''continuous exercise is protective, rather than destructive,'' to knees. You can't be a runner past the age of 40, as I am, without hearing that running will ruin your knees, by which doomsayers usually mean that we'll develop ''degeneration of the cartilage in the kneecap, which reduces its shock-absorbing capacity,'' says Ross Tucker, a physiologist in South Africa and co-author of the new book ''The Runner's Body: How the Latest Exercise Science Can Help You Run Stronger, Longer and Faster.'' In other words, we'll be afflicted with arthritis."

It is also one of the most debated, with a long string of critics claiming that the photo, of a soldier seemingly at the moment of death, was faked. Now, a new book by a Spanish researcher asserts that the picture could not have been made where, when or how Capa’s admirers and heirs have claimed."

2009-08-17T09:18:05Z,"Right before the lights went down at “Powerhouse,” a portrait of the visionary career and blinkered personal life of musical pioneer Raymond Scott, I leaned forward to the row in front of me to ask the longtime publicist of the Fringe Festival, Ron Lasko, if he had seen anything great that I should know about. “No!” he said in a refreshing break from tradition of the usual press agent puffery (Ron, God bless him, had also warned me to avoid the opening ceremonies at all costs, which is the kind of thing that can give a flack a reputation for honesty)."
2009-08-17T11:07:01Z,"For the second time this summer, it has been reported that the Prince of Wales sought to have an architect replaced on a major British construction project. The Guardian reported that Prince Charles lobbied for the removal of Jean Nouvel, the French architect and the winner of the 2008 Pritzker Prize, as the designer of an $815 million office and shopping complex planned for a site near St Paul’s Cathedral, the 17th century structure designed by Christopher Wren. In a letter sent in 2005 to the commercial developer Land Securities, The Guardian said, Prince Charles wrote that the complex should feature a design that would “allow St Paul’s to shine bright,” and suggested that his own architectural advisers, who prefer traditional designs, should help. The office of the royal family at Clarence House confirmed to The Guardian that the prince had sent the letter after Mr. Nouvel, a modernist architect, was named the winner of an international competition to design the complex. In June, the architect Richard Rogers accused the prince of abusing his power after he had him removed as the designer of a housing project to be built in London’s Chelsea district, near the Royal Hospital designed by Christopher Wren."
2009-08-17T12:05:03Z,"In his bestselling novel “Lord of the Flies,” William Golding vividly reminded readers of the primal side of man that lurks beneath his civilized demeanor. The Nobel Prize-winning author was apparently no stranger to barbaric behavior: in an unpublished memoir composed for his wife, Mr. Golding wrote that he tried to rape a 15-year-old girl when he was a young man, The Times of London reported. The account of the incident written by Mr. Golding, who died in 1993, was discovered by John Carey, the chief book reviewer of The Sunday Times of London and an emeritus professor of English literature at Oxford University, who is the author of a coming biography, “William Golding: The Man Who Wrote ‘Lord of the Flies,'” and who had access to Mr. Golding’s archives. In the unpublished memoir, called “Men, Women & Now,” Mr. Golding wrote that he had tried to rape a friend, whom he calls Dora, after he returned home at age 18 from his first year at Oxford. Mr. Golding also wrote that as a schoolteacher, he would pit his pupils against each other in “Lord of the Flies”-like experiments, to see what happened when he gave them more freedom. The novel, about a group of schoolboys who revert to savagery while stranded on a deserted island, was published in 1954."
2009-08-17T11:00:33Z,"The first time I attended the New York International Fringe Festival, ten years ago, it was on a date. What a horrible idea! For one thing, a solo adaptation of Dostoyevsky’s existentialist rant “Notes from Underground” does not exactly make for a romantic night out. It’s also hard to think of an easier way to scare away a young woman you recently met than to bring her to a grim, sweltering basement in the scrappy, early days of the festival when air-conditioning and elbow-room were scarce. And yet the over-packed theater, bathed in blackness, forced me and my game companion into close quarters, our knees briefly (and memorably) touching during one of the Underground Man’s splenetic screeds."

The previous inflatable Spider-Man made has first appearance in the parade in 1987 and retired from the procession in 1998.

2009-08-17T12:51:13Z,"Shah Rukh Khan, the Indian film star who was detained by American immigration officials at a New Jersey airport on Friday, criticized the United States in an interview on Monday, Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Khan, who is promoting the film “My Name Is Khan,” which addresses the racial profiling of Muslims after Sept. 11, 2001, told the Indian television channel CNN-IBN that the United States does not lead “an isolated, parallel universe existence,” and that “there is a whole world which makes all the good and bad that is happening,” according to Agence France-Presse. Mr. Khan added: “So if we are scared of violence and terrorism, all of us are responsible for it. It’s not that the world is and America is not.” Mr. Khan was at Newark Liberty International Airport after immigration officials said that his name had come up on a routine alert list. The officials said that Mr. Khan was not “formally held,” and that his examination, which lasted about an hour, would have gone faster if his luggage had not been lost. The actor’s detention has been widely discussed within the Indian community and condemned by Indian film stars and politicians."

In the third quarter of 2006, however, before the economy started to sour, the second factor was network quality, followed by the reputation of the carrier. By the first quarter of this year, people had pushed aside quality in favor of saving money. The second factor was the availability of a family plan -- one way to save money.

The anniversary event, to be held on Oct. 15 at the Ziegfeld Theater in Manhattan, was announced Tuesday by the Independent Film Channel and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, which are jointly organizing the event. In a news release, the groups said that the Monty Python founders John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and, somehow, Graham Chapman (who died in 1989) would be present for a screening of the documentary “Monty Python: Almost the Truth (The Lawyer’s Cut),” after which the surviving comedians would take part in a Q&A session and receive an award from the British Academy. The group has variously reunited several times over the years, from a 1998 appearance at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen to the 2005 opening of the Broadway musical “Monty Python’s Spamalot.” A six-hour version of the documentary will have its premiere on IFC on Oct. 18."

2009-08-18T12:20:17Z,"One of the great joys of strolling London - definitely one of the world's greatest cities for aimless wanders - is spotting the city's ""blue plaques,"" signs posted on the facades of buildings that commemorate the lives of those who lived and worked inside. The plaques, which in fact aren't always blue, are themselves objects of beauty, attractively lettered in highly legible fashion and often featuring intricate border designs. Most important, though, they remind the passerby of the incredibly rich historical fabric of this city, viewed through the lens of individuals, some household names, others not, who have called it home. This week, Yale University Press releases ""Lived in London: Blue Plaques and the Stories Behind Them,"" a comprehensive guide to 800 of the plaques arranged by geographic area.The book, which is arranged by geographic area, includes contemporary and archival images as well as lovely illustrated maps detailing where you can find the plaques. Equally enjoyable is the text, which is full of interesting tidbits, like the fact that the critic and biographer Lytton Strachey's lost dissertation was discovered in the basement of his house at 51 Gordon Square more than 30 years after his death, or that the writer H.G. Wells wrote in his own obituary that he occupied ""an old tumble-down house"" on Hanover Terrace when in fact the house was practically luxurious, then and now. There are plenty of entries about fascinating figures you may never have heard of - such as the calligrapher Edward Johnston, whose sans serif font is used for the London Underground's signage - and one of the compelling things about reading an entire section is learning the historical character (bohemian, prosperous, workaday) of individual London neighborhoods, as evidenced by the kind of people who lived there."

And I must say that I cannot understand how the team was given that penalty in the first place - it did not receive a penalty the last time it lost a wheel in Hungary.) Grosjean has not been performing brilliantly in GP2 and now here he is replacing a guy who DID perform well in GP2 (Nelson Piquet Jr.) and alongside a double world champion. It could go either way, but mostly will be interesting to watch. And after all the criticism that Piquet threw Flavio Briatore's way, I'll bet the team would be delighted to see Grosjean do well. But at Fernando Alonso's (second) home race?"

The new brand of men's and women's organic cotton skivvies, founded by two social entrepreneurs in partnership with the design celeb Yves Behar, donates 10 percent of each sale to the nonprofits Oceana, ForestEthics and 826 Valencia, the writing workshop for kids started by Dave Eggers. Each cause has its own pattern, as interpreted by Behar - abstract waves, spindly trees, crisscrossing sentences - though PACT will soon expand the roster of beneficiaries and of artists enlisted to translate them into undergarments. The goal is to get you to stop splashing Bjorn Borg's name across your heinie and start using that space to advertise your good deeds instead. PACT's cheeky motto? ""Change starts with your underwear."" Indeed."

2009-08-18T00:00:00Z,"ROSHKOW--Sylvia E.,died August 10 after a courageous fight with multiple myeloma, surrounded and supported by the family she nurtured and adored and that, in turn, adored her. Born in Brooklyn in 1929, she was the youngest of four siblings who helped raise her after her parents both died within a tragically short period when she was still a child. Nicknamed Tippi, she remained the baby of the family her entire life, a role that she embraced and that helped mould her unique blend of self-deprecating humor and eternal optimism. Together with Howard, her husband of fifty-six years, she served as the emotional center of a vital and supportive circle of friends first in Inwood, then New Rochelle and, finally back to Manhattan. Sylvia gratefully assumed the responsibilities of confidante, surrogate parent and mentor to an endless collection of colleagues and friends, as well as friends of her children who constantly sought out her company and advice. Beyond her actual family, she was also honored and appreciated by the many students who passed through her classroom during her almost thirty years as an English professor at Hunter College. She possessed the teacher's ideal skill set: an almost superhuman tolerance, a love of learning, a touch of the theatrical, and finally, a ferocious erudition that she never wore on her sleeve and that informed her successful career as an author of respected textbooks, the last of which she was editing during her final days. She was a loving grandmother to her three grandchildren, all of whom reveled in her playful imagination. She was predeceased by her husband, Howard, sister, Doris Krasnow; and brother, Philip Pearson. She is survived by her daughter, Julia, her son, Matthew, sister, Evelyn Rokaw, her grandchildren Rachel, Jacob and Luke, her son-in-law Steve Salzman, her daughter-in-law Helaine Olen, numerous nieces and nephews, as well as all those touched by her generosity and light.

In a new series, “Oliver Stone’s Secret History of America,” the director and screenwriter (whose resume includes “Platoon,” “Wall Street” and “The Doors”) will create 10 documentary films that will focus on different episodes in United States history — episodes so secret that perhaps only Mr. Stone knows the truth about them. Reuters said that topics would include the Cold War, Harry S. Truman‘s decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan and the global role of the United States since the fall of Communism. Over the years, Mr. Stone has been criticized for his depictions of John F. Kennedy’s assassination and George W.

A remarkable historian, he was thoroughly decent, kind, and warm, ready to share his wit and joyful song with all. Born in the Bronx in 1928, he graduated from CCNY, received his Ph.D. from Columbia University, and did further study at the London School of Economics. A member of the history department at SUNY Stony Brook from 1960-90, he then served as Distinguished Professor of History at the CUNY Graduate School until retiring in 1996. He received fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the National Humanities Center. He was the editor of the Journal of British Studies, a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, and served on the professional division of the American Historical Association. He published 11 books, among them Imperialism and Social Reform, Jamaican Blood and Victorian Conscience, The Rise of Free Trade Imperialism, The Methodist Revolution, John Stuart Mill and the Pursuit of Virtue, and George Eliot and the Politics of National Inheritance. His historical scholarship was driven by a love of the past for its own sake, but also by the conviction that its study could shed light on contemporary problems, not least the tension between democratic politics and geopolitical power. He loved New York and London and made his home in Stony Brook for over 40 years. He was devoted to his family, and they to him. In loving memory, Maxine, Stuart, Tina, Tovah, Natalie, Eli, and Ada."

(He was also known for rendering politicians as rats and policeman as pigs.) Thirty years after the Panthers disbanded, and in conjunction with the retrospective ""Emory Douglas: Black Panther"" currently on view at the New Museum of Contemporary Art (through Oct. 18), the revolution begins again. A group of Harlem teenagers have remixed three of Douglas's earlier images from the newspaper The Black Panther with some of his more recent images to create a mural that addresses local community concerns - education, health care and unity. In partnership with the New Museum, the Studio Museum in Harlem and Groundswell, a nonprofit organization that brings artists and communities together, the mural, titled ""What We Want, What We Believe,"" will be the first public artwork celebrating the work of Douglas in New York City.

He says anyone who's not working (which is basically everyone, this being August in Europe) is probably at the Hydropark, a bosky island getaway in the middle of the Dnieper River. To get there you cross the Metro, Venetian or Rusanivka bridges, which link you to green dales, wide stretches of yellow sand beach and cracked, cement embankments from the Soviet era, where thousands of people swim and sunbathe within comfortable reach of the city.Every tribe has their section of beach: gays, nudists, families, young hipsters, old men and women with their naked grandchildren building sand castles. On a hot summer day in Kiev, you're here or you're nobody. Hydropark Island is also something of a stage for showing off that mesh outfit that, if you're Ukrainian, you've had in your closet since last summer (for everyone else, since 1980). Dominic says mesh T-shirts and tanks made by a nondescript brand called Sports Company are all the rage among older men, young guys and even daring women. ""I don't know if it's really so much a style as it is a lifestyle,"" he says, reminding me of Ukraine's long, withering winters and suggesting that the second it gets warm in Kiev, everyone shows as much skin as possible."

And no issue in Vogue's history was bigger than the September 2007 issue. R.J. Cutler's documentary is not, then, about Anna Wintour, the magazine's editor in chief. She dominates the opening scenes; he asserts that she has papal powers and that her short attention span and dislike of dark colors make designers cluck like chickens before the dinner hour (the scene when she visits YSL designer Stefano Pilati for a preview of his collection is alone worth the price of admission). But Mr. Cutler seemed to realize that he couldn't handle everything in his movie. Besides, the popular view of Ms. Wintour as an ice queen of chic has already been covered in another film, ""The Devil Wears Prada."" Mr. Cutler would have farce if he lingered there - Ms. Wintour imitating Meryl Streep imitating Miranda Priestley.

Some packs have retractable handles and wheels that convert them to rollers. The American Physical Therapy Association recommends that children carry no more than 15 percent of their body weight on their backs, said Mary Ann Wilmarth, a spokeswoman for the group. ''Otherwise they risk injury, mainly to the back and shoulders,'' said Dr. Wilmarth, who directs one of Northeastern University's doctorate programs in physical therapy and has written several studies on the effect of backpack use on children."

During those seven years, his illness never diminished the power of his intellect and he never defined himself by his illness. He lived all of his life with grace, humor and a sunny disposition. In 2003 he finished his B.A. in art history at Stanford and was initiated into Phi Beta Kappa. He was a semi-finalist for a Rhodes scholarship. He was a sports writer for The Stanford Daily covering men's tennis. Chris had been a member of the 1999-2000 team when Stanford was the NCAA Champion as well as the 2001-2 team when he returned from spending his junior year in Paris. While in Paris, Chris had been an intern at the Musee D'Orsay and Rodin Museum. He spent the summers of 2002 and 2003 in Antibes, France as a counselor for Abbey Road, an exchange program for American teenagers In 2004, he graduated from Stanford with a M.A. in Humanities. He was a research assistant at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. In 2005, he began a Ph.D. program in art history at Harvard and received a Harvard Presidential Fellowship. He also received a Mellon Fellowship that same year. While at Harvard, he successfully completed his course work, acted as a teaching fellow, submitted his qualifying paper, received a Mellon summer fellowship at the Getty Museum in 18th Century studies and completed his orals. This year he finished most of the first chapter of his dissertation. Most importantly during those seven years, he met and married Monica Lara Cordoba. Christopher and Monica brought out the best in each other just as Christopher has brought out the best in all of us and just as he has always demanded the best of himself. We are going to miss him so very much. Christopher is survived by his wife, Monica, of San Francisco; his parents, Michael and Tina, of Berkeley; his brother, Joshua and his sister-in-law Fleur and his nephew, Theodore, of Paris, France."

2009-08-23T00:00:00Z,"MEYER--Christopher, age 28, died August 8th, 2009 of a brain tumor that was first diagnosed in 2002. During those seven years, his illness never diminished the power of his intellect and he never defined himself by his illness. He lived all of his life with grace, humor and a sunny disposition. In 2003 he finished his B.A. in art history at Stanford and was initiated into Phi Beta Kappa. He was a semi-finalist for a Rhodes scholarship. He was a sports writer for The Stanford Daily covering men's tennis. Chris had been a member of the 1999-2000 team when Stanford was the NCAA Champion as well as the 2001-2 team when he returned from spending his junior year in Paris. While in Paris, Chris had been an intern at the Musee D'Orsay and Rodin Museum. He spent the summers of 2002 and 2003 in Antibes, France as a counselor for Abbey Road, an exchange program for American teenagers In 2004, he graduated from Stanford with a M.A. in Humanities. He was a research assistant at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. In 2005, he began a Ph.D. program in art history at Harvard and received a Harvard Presidential Fellowship. He also received a Mellon Fellowship that same year. While at Harvard, he successfully completed his course work, acted as a teaching fellow, submitted his qualifying paper, received a Mellon summer fellowship at the Getty Museum in 18th Century studies and completed his orals. This year he finished most of the first chapter of his dissertation. Most importantly during those seven years, he met and married Monica Lara Cordoba. Christopher and Monica brought out the best in each other just as Christopher has brought out the best in all of us and just as he has always demanded the best of himself. We are going to miss him so very much. Christopher is survived by his wife, Monica, of San Francisco; his parents, Michael and Tina, of Berkeley; his brother, Joshua and his sister-in-law Fleur and his nephew, Theodore, of Paris, France."
2009-08-23T00:00:00Z,"NAMED for its size, ''SUMO,'' Helmut Newton's 1999 monograph, is a beast of a book. More than two feet tall, 480 pages thick and weighing nearly 70 pounds (for manageability, each of the 10,000 editions came with a stainless steel stand designed by Philippe Starck), it was the largest and most expensive book of the 20th century. A copy signed by more than 100 celebrities portrayed in it sold at auction in 1999 for $350,000. Today, issues go for $10,000 and up. Not in the budget? No matter. In celebration of the 10th anniversary of ''SUMO,'' a considerably smaller edition is now being released, priced at a relatively puny $150. ''Helmut always longed for a more democratic dispersal of his work,'' Benedikt Taschen, the book's publisher, explained. ''This new edition is the fulfillment of an ambition conceived years ago. We jokingly referred to it as 'Newton for the poor.' ''"

2009-08-23T00:00:00Z,"HOWATT--Shelby Moorman, passed away August 15th after a short battle with stomach cancer. She was born in Owensboro Kentucky on May 30, 1936 to a family with deep Southern roots. She graduated from Princeton High School and Smith College, where her love of the theater took root. Shelby married John Charles Howatt and together they raised four children. While raising her children in Pelham, New York, her natural talent and artistic passion were expressed through her writing. Featured among countless other published works, she wrote a weekly article in the Home section of the New York Times, focusing on the reality of raising a large family while juggling a stressful career. After retiring from professional writing, Shelby moved to her beloved New York City, and became a therapist, specializing in treating drug addiction as well as compulsive hair pulling. She lifted the spirits of all who had the fortune to meet her with her infectious smile and beautiful blue eyes; patiently and earnestly listening to their life stories and lending sage advice when needed. She was also a tireless volunteer, donating her time to The International House teaching ESL and helping her local library among other efforts. Shelby will be missed by her children Toddy, Daniel, Laura, and Charles; her grandchildren Matthew, James, Sam, Isabel, Sarah, Jackson, Adalene, Zachary, Layne, and Joseph; her brother Jack Moorman, her niece and her nephews.

Nowadays it seems almost sad, like a tarted-up party girl, drunk and dancing long after everyone has gone home. ''Sequins in general are done and done,'' the stylist Frances Tulk-Hart said. ''They go hand in hand with the whole '80s thing, which ought to come to an end as well.'' Not that a little glitz isn't good. The runways for fall were illuminated with shiny pieces -- loose metallic trousers in particular -- that somehow felt fresh in the way they were casually styled. At Isabel Marant (near right) and Etro (center right) they were worn with slouchy T-shirts and nubby sweaters. Off the runways, women are pairing them with breezy silk blouses and leather bomber jackets. The overall effect? A kind of stripped-down, easygoing glamour that looks right and rich in this day and age."

Born Grace Josephine Goodson in Allendale, South Carolina, to William Henry Goodson and Mary Ella Rogers Goodson, she was the youngest of five siblings. After graduating from Winthrop College in 1944, she worked as part of the Manhattan Project in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, during World War II. After the war, she met her husband, John, while they both worked for the U.S. Government in Wiesbaden, Germany, during postwar reconstruction. The couple returned to the United States, where they lived in Detroit, Michigan. Mrs. Rupinski worked as assistant to the general counsel of General Motors there before beginning a family with her husband. Relocating to Montclair, New Jersey, she taught business English and other subjects at the Katharine Gibbs School in Montclair. She also held positions in New York City over the years, including working as an advertising assistant at The New Yorker magazine, a publication she read avidly. She had a lifelong love of the English language and the written word, and was fond of reciting her favorite poems, as well as reading the works of English novelists, particularly those with an understanding of the nuances of family and social life. Upon retirement, she and her husband settled in Manhattan, where her passion for books was well served by the New York Public Library. She also enjoyed exploring the city she loved on its many public buses. All who knew her appreciated her wit, humor and judgment. Over the years, her friends, colleagues and family would often ask for her expert opinion on syntax, usage, and written style. She was predeceased by her parents, her brother Henry, and her sister Caroline. She is survived by her husband, her sister Juanita, and her brother Angus, her children Karen R. Roberts, Mark and Charles, and her granddaughters Sarah and Morgan. She will be laid to rest in her hometown of Allendale. A memorial gathering is planned for a later date. Contributions in her memory may be made to the New York Public Library."

2009-08-23T00:00:00Z,"THE jewelry designer Eddie Borgo has a habit of making refined, punk-inspired pieces -- slender spike earrings, metal fringe cuffs -- that cause fashion editors to go into a tizzy. Which is to say that since introducing his line in March, he has seen his pieces turn up in many a major fashion magazine, and on many a major stylist. As he modestly put it, ''I get a lot of personal orders.'' Such was indeed the case with his latest design, a leather belt adorned with silver pyramids. Mr. Borgo had been making them as one-offs for friends (Vanessa Traina, among them) until people started inquiring. Consequently his plan to expand into belts next spring was, by popular demand, amended to late this summer. Fine by him. ''I believe in an organic evolution,'' he said. ''I do things as they come.''"

2009-08-23T00:00:00Z,"BRISTOL--William McLaren III, a former executive at Bristol-Myers Company and Chairman Emeritus and Life Trustee of Hamilton College and generous benefactor to numerous individuals and organizations, died Tuesday morning, August 18, 2009 at his home in Newtown, Pennsylvania. He was 88. The cause of death was metastatic lung cancer. Mr. Bristol spent his entire professional life with the Bristol-Myers Company, retiring as Executive Vice President, and was the third generation to lead a company founded by his grandfather in 1887. During Mr. Bristol's tenure, Bristol-Myers grew from a mid-sized drug company to become one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. He also served as President of the Proprietary Association. Aside from his family, Mr. Bristol's greatest love in life was Hamilton College. He graduated in the class of 1943 and spent the rest of his life in service to his alma mater. He was a member of the Board of Trustees for over fifty years and served as Chairman from 1977 to 1990. During his tenure as Chairman, he spearheaded what was then the largest capital campaign in the College's history, concentrating throughout his years on the Board on increasing the endowment while enhancing the physical plant and campus environment. Mr. Bristol also focused his and his family's giving on financial aid, thereby opening Hamilton's doors to many who would not otherwise have been able to attend. Mr. Bristol was a fifth generation Bristol to attend Hamilton and was proud to be succeeded by a son and three grandchildren. His great-great-great-grandfather, Joel Bristol, was one of the College's original trustees. Hamilton's President, Joan Hinde Stewart, said that ""Mac spent much of his life working to make Hamilton not just better, but the best college in the country. For well over half a century, he was a visible and spiritual presence on College Hill. It is hard to imagine Hamilton without his loyalty, leadership, passion, determination and competitive spirit. Put simply, he was our College's heart and soul."" William McLaren Bristol III was born in Brooklyn, New York on July 24, 1921. He attended the Pingry School, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, subsequently serving as a trustee from 1959 to 1985 and ultimately as Chairman of the Board. Mr. Bristol matriculated at Hamilton College in 1939, where he majored in Latin and earned nine varsity letters in football, basketball and baseball. He left Hamilton before graduation in 1943 to serve in World War II as a member of The United States Marine Corps. Mr. Bristol fought in the Battle of Iwo Jima, served as a member of the occupation forces in Japan and was honorably discharged as a First Lieutenant in 1946. Mr. Bristol is survived by his beloved second wife, Mary Jayne Comey, whose love of Mr. Bristol embraced family, Hamilton and professional football. His first marriage, to the former Dorothea Tilton, ended in divorce. Mr. Bristol is also survived by his four children, Pamela Bristol of Ringoes, New Jersey, Brian Bristol of New York, New York, Pinny Kuckel of Deansboro, New York and Sanford Bristol of Summit, New Jersey; as well as his seven grandchildren, Nicholas Kuckel, Monica Odening, Nathaniel Bristol, Courtney Odening, Abigail Bristol, Scott Odening and Samuel Bristol. A Funeral Mass will be held Thursday, August 27, at 11:00am at St. Vincent de Paul Church, 654 Hatboro Road, Richboro, PA. 18954. A Memorial Service will be held at Hamilton College on September 12.

2009-08-23T00:00:00Z,"The literary scholar Richard Poirier, who died last weekend at the age of 83, was one of the strong critics of his time. Like Harold Bloom, Pauline Kael and Clement Greenberg, he identified a lineage of artists and introduced a way to make sense of them. For five decades, Mr. Poirier taught literature at Rutgers University, where he founded Raritan, a quarterly named for the river that borders New Brunswick. He reached a broader public by collaborating with another man of letters, Edmund Wilson, to create the Library of America, which continues to assemble a canon of American masterworks, printed on perfectly white acid-free paper to last for the ages. These were impressive achievements. But Mr. Poirier's most important contribution came in his criticism, which tried to convey why the act of reading is -- and should be -- so difficult. The most powerful works of literature, he insisted, offer ''a fairly direct access to pleasure'' but become ''on longer acquaintance, rather strange and imponderable.'' Even as readers try to pin down what a writer means, the best authors try to elude them, using all the resources of sound, rhythm and syntax to defeat any straightforward account of what they are doing."

2009-08-23T00:00:00Z,"OUTWATER--John Ogden, Jr.,Sc.D., Ph.D., died in Shelburne, VT on August 12, 2009 at age 86. He was born in London, England and grew up in London, New York and Norway. He was the son of Nenny Boe and John Ogden Outwater. During World War II his parents and younger brother returned to the US while John finished Stowe School in England. Students were assigned night watches on the roof while London burned in the distance, to look for German parachutists; the boys sat with a bucket of water to douse any incendiary bombs. Most classmates were drafted straight into the army but his superior grades allowed him two years at Cambridge University in Trinity College if he majored in engineering or medicine (what the army needed). He graduated in 1943. The week before the Allied invasion, John was transferred to the British Indian Army - which he credited with his survival. Half his classmates were killed during the invasion. He left war torn England on a troop ship and spent the next four years in India keeping 200 vehicles running for the troops. He was discharged in 1947 as a Captain. Following his return to the U.S. John received his Sc.D. from MIT in Mechanical Engineering (1950) and a Ph.D. from Cambridge University in (1976). He was a professor at the University of Vermont (1955-93). He was known as the Father of Ski Safety for developing the first testing device to allow ski bindings to be set to release before the bone broke. He measured the force necessary to break the leg bone, so the bindings would release at a certain strain based on the height and weight of the person - this led to the anti-friction pad now used on all downhill skis. He built prototypes of binding testers in his basement workshop and formed the Vermont Instrument Company. He led four archeology expeditions for the Wenner-Gren Foundation to Olanaytambo, Mexico, Peru and Haiti, accompanied by Alice who always relished the adventures. His interests were wide. He approached each challenge systematically by taking summer courses, doing research that often resulted in publication of scientific papers of which he had scores. He was fascinated by the law and was an expert witness concerning ski accidents in nearly 1,000 cases. He was a lifelong chess player and Vermont Champion twice. He leaves Alice, his beloved bride of 58 years, and four children, Dr. Anne Hooker Outwater of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Catherine Boe of Santa Monica, CA and her son Arthur Boe Colby of Washington, DC, Alice Brookfield Outwater and her husband Robert B. Lang and son Samuel Outwater Lang of Durango, Co, and Dr. John Ogden Outwater III of Cambridge, MA; his brother Eric B. Outwater of Center Valley, PA.

The 32,000-square-foot museum, which opened in 1985 in Paris’s Marais district, holds about 5,000 pieces of art by Picasso, including paintings, sculptures and sketches, but was only able to display between 250 and 300 at a time. During the renovation, which is expected to cost about $28 million and begin next year, the museum will be expanded and made more accessible, as well having electrical problems fixed. In the meantime, the museum will stop lending out its artworks as experts update its inventory, after which the works will be packaged and shipped to storerooms managed by France’s museum authority.

That model can then be used by archaeologists to repair the granite portraits of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. CyArk, which hopes to create 500 models of famous locations and monuments around the world, said that other sites could be at risk, including the Acropolis in Athens, which is threatened by acid rain, and Machu Picchu in Peru, which suffers from excessive tourism.

2009-08-24T04:10:19Z,"When Hideki Aoyama, the director of the Aoyama Meguro gallery in Tokyo, decided to join the citywide Architecture Japan 2009 exhibition going on this month, he wanted to do something different than presenting the standard miniature model. And he didn't have to look far for ideas: his gallery shares a building with the progressive Schemata Architecture firm. So Aoyama and Schemata's Jo Nagasaka teamed up to create a full-scale walk-in, sleep-in architecture exhibit, the Happa Hotel. ""We chose a hotel instead of, say, a living room, because hotels represent a space where a great number of people come in contact with architecture,"" Aoyama said.The two single rooms are arranged vertically, with treehouse-style platforms forming the tables, chairs and nightstands. The whole construction (except for the hammock that serves as a bed) is made of the Styrofoam used in architecture models, reinforced with wood and metal screws. (This is earthquake territory, after all). At night the steel shutters go down, sealing off hotel guests behind the front windows of the gallery in a space four meters tall and only 55 centimeters deep. The brave individuals who sign up to be living displays are afforded some token privacy - a small curtain and a key to the front door that also opens the bathroom - not to mention a cool location in Nakameguro and what is probably the lowest room rate in Tokyo: 3,000 yen (about $32)."

The youngest of three sons of Bernhardt and Fern Naeve, he was born October 9, 1931, on a ranch near Arnold, Kansas. Mr. Naeve graduated from high school in Loveland, Colorado in 1949 and received his BFA from the University of Colorado in 1953. He was a member of Delta Phi Delta, Phi Epsilon Phi, Tau Delta and Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He was selected a member of the second class of Winterthur Fellows receiving a MFA in 1955 from the Winterthur Program in American Studies jointly sponsored by the University of Delaware and the Henry Francis duPont Winterthur Museum. Following two years of service in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, he held curatorial and administrative positions at Winterthur Museum for the next 10 years. As Secretary of the museum from 1959-1963, he catalogued and administered Mr. duPont's gifts of his collection to the museum. He was the founding editor of the Winterthur Portfolio and was responsible for the first three volumes. Mr. Naeve was Curator of Colonial Williamsburg and Director of the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center before being recruited to be the first curator for the newly founded American Arts Department of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1975. He was responsible for American decorative arts from the 17th c. to the present and American painting and sculpture to 1901. In 1984, he was named the Field-McCormick Curator of American Arts. Funded by Marshall Field V, President of the Board of Trustees of the Art Institute of Chicago and Brooks McCormick, Chairman of the American Arts Committee, it was the first curatorial position endowed at the Art Institute. Mr. Naeve was responsible for the concept, planning, and installation of the acclaimed Field-McCormick Galleries of American Arts, which opened in 1988 in the Daniel and Ada Rice Building, an addition to the Art Institute. At the time of his retirement in 1991, Mr. Field noted ""purchases and gifts during the past 17 years have more than doubled the departmental collections and masterpieces in furniture and painting of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries have brought national stature to those collections and pre-eminence in surveys of silver, 20th c. decorative arts and 19th c. sculpture"". His service was recognized by the honorary title of Field-McCormick Curator Emeritus of American Arts. He is cited as a thorough scholar, a fine judge of aesthetic quality in a work of art, a curator's curator. In 1991, Mr. Naeve received the first Life Time Achievement Award granted by the Illinois Academy of Fine Arts for his contributions to the Arts in Illinois. In 1996, he was the recipient of the Decorative Arts Society Robert C. Smith Award for the most influential article in the decorative arts for 1996. Subsequently, he has served as Chairman of the award selection committee. He was the author of The Classical Presence in American Art, published by the Art Institute of Chicago; John Lewis Krimmel: An Artist in Federal America, University of Delaware Press and three editions of Identifying American Furniture: Colonial to Contemporary. He was researching and writing the Landscape Garden in America. He wrote numerous articles and reviews. Especially commended among the essays and frequently reprinted is one about the rarely discussed subject of connoisseurship entitled, ""The A, B, C, D's of Collecting"". He lectured widely in the United States and England. Mr. Naeve served on the boards of The Library Company of Philadelphia, Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, and the Sewell Biggs Museum of American Art.

In a statement on Wednesday, Playwrights Horizons said that Ms. Posey, a star of films like “Best in Show” and “Waiting for Guffman,” had withdrawn from the company’s coming production of “This,” a new comedy planned for its 2009-10 season. The statement said that Ms. Posey would not be able to participate “due to developing a case of Lyme disease.” The comedy, written by Melissa James Gibson and directed by Daniel Aukin, focuses on a widow (to have been played by Ms. Posey) and her circle of friends. Playwrights Horizons said that it was still planning to begin previews of the show at its mainstage theater on Nov. 6 and open the production on Dec. 2, and that it would announce a replacement for Ms. Posey shortly."

Among the traditional songs that Mr. Dylan will perform on the album, which Columbia Records is to release on Oct. 13, are “Here Comes Santa Claus,” “Winter Wonderland,” “Little Drummer Boy” and “Must Be Santa.” A statement on the Web site said that all of Mr. Dylan’s royalties in the United States from the album would be donated to the charity Feeding America, and that he planned to donate his international royalties to organizations in Britain and elsewhere that provide meals during the holiday season. “Christmas in the Heart” is the 47th album by Mr. Dylan."
2009-08-26T11:04:03Z,"Amid a summer in which he has tangled with several notable architects and architectural institutions, the Prince of Wales is calling for new laws in Britain that would allow the public to have more input in new building developments, The Times of London reported. Hank Dittmar, the chief executive of Prince Charles’s architectural charity, the Prince’s Foundation, told The Times of London, “People feel very disenfranchised by the planning system.” Under the proposals, residents near new developments would be asked to decide what features and architecture styles would be used in master plans, instead of being consulted after plans have been designed. Scotland has already adopted a similar system after government officials met with the prince. In June Richard Rogers accused the prince of abusing his power after he intervened to have him removed as the designer of a housing project, and earlier this month, it was revealed that the prince had sought to remove Jean Nouvel as the designer of an office and shopping complex."

The series started on Britain’s Channel 4 in 2000 just days after an American version began on CBS as the reality television craze got under way. It also made a celebrity out of Jade Goody, a contestant who was accused of making racist remarks about a fellow housemate and who later made a public display of her decline and death from cancer. But ratings for the show have fallen off, to about 2 million viewers an episode from a peak of 8 million in 2002. The final British season of “Big Brother” will begin next summer."

Earlier today Nike blocked off Broadway between 22nd and 23rd Streets and constructed a pop-up tennis court, where three of the sport's top players - Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams - showed off their new U.S. Open ensembles and hit some balls with a few lucky kids from four different inner-city programs.Federer, the 15-time Grand Slam singles champion, looked slightly less subdued than usual in his new red and black look; Williams, who remains the No. 2 women's player despite having won three of the last four majors, sported a minidress in her favorite color, fuchsia; and Nadal, the reigning Australian Open champ, wore an oddly chic taxicab-yellow polo shirt that we're hoping means he really is done with his signature sleeveless tees. Along with the tennis legend John McEnroe, the three champions played mentor/coach to kids from the New York Junior Tennis League, Athletes for Charity, Mentoring USA and the New York City Parks Foundation, which each received $10,000 donations from Nike. Needless to say, the kids were psyched about their encounters with the gracious, and brightly dressed, tennis legends - not to mention all the free Nike gear. Love!"

But step down Emser Strasse, a typical Neukolln side street of cobbled stone and abandoned sofas, and you'll happen across WOAH, a small gallery housed in an old tailor's shop in a traditional Jugendstil-style building. It opened four months ago, thanks in part to an initiative by a local organization called Zwischennutzungsagentur, which seeks to fill the neighborhood's many empty storefronts with creative types willing to turn them into art spaces in exchange for dirt-cheap rent.WOAH is the brainchild of a group of expat art professionals - the Britons Ian Liddle and Simon Knight and the Spanish fashion designers Raquel Fernandez and Raquel Hladky - each of whom invested 300 euros to get started. Together, they've created a space that alternates monthly between a two-room exhibition/studio space showing off some of the city's rawest artistic talent and a shop selling the collective's hand-tooled clothing line. It's multidisciplinary, multimedia, multiculture and extremely loose - a perfect example of the kind of grass-roots gallery scene now flourishing in this previously neglected quarter."

The effort will promote a government-run health insurance plan -- the so-called public option, which appears to be on life-support."

In an email message, a publicist for the Guggenheim said that “Frank Lloyd Wright: From Within Outward,” a retrospective of Wright’s work timed to the museum’s 50th anniversary that included drawings and models (including his original model for the Guggenheim Museum itself) drew 372,000 visitors for the 87 days it ran there, from May 15 through Aug. 23. The exhibition is now on its way to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, where it will be shown from Oct. 22 through Feb. 14. The museum said that prior to “From Within Outward,” its best-attended exhibition had been “Frank Gehry, Architect,” which it ran in 2001, followed by “Cai Guo-Qiang: I Want to Believe” in 2008, “Giorgio Armani” in 2000 and “The Art of the Motorcycle” in 1998."

The official Web site for the show, which is being held on Sept. 25 near Kuala Lumpur to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Guinness brewery in Dublin, said that “the party is only open to non-Muslims aged 18 years and above.” Of Malaysia’s 25 million people, 60 percent are Muslims; Islamic law forbids the consumption of alcohol. An official at the Ministry of Information, Communication and Culture in Malaysia told The A.P. that government regulations normally prevent alcohol companies from staging concerts, but that an exception had been made in hopes of increasing tourism. “Muslims cannot attend,” the official said. “Non-Muslims can go and have fun.” Recent concerts in Malaysia featuring singers like Gwen Stefani, Avril Lavigne and Beyoncé have drawn the ire of conservative Muslims who have protested the singers’ revealing costumes."

At least this time she doesn’t have to wear roller skates. On Thursday, publicists for the Broadway musical “Rock of Ages” said in a news release that Ms. Butler would join its cast on Sept. 21 in the role of Sherrie, the female lead. Ms. Butler, who earned a Tony Award nomination for playing Kira in the Broadway musical adaptation of “Xanadu,” will play the “Rock of Ages” role for six performances a week, the news release said, and her understudy will play the role during both performances on Sundays. The role of Sherrie, a Kansas native who arrives in Los Angeles in the 1980s with dreams of movie stardom, was originated on Broadway by Amy Spanger, who withdrew from the show in June for personal reasons. She was replaced by Savannah Wise, who is joining the cast of the “Ragtime” revival."

The artwork, said to be called “The Naked Woman,” was taken from the Kuwait National Museum during the Iraqi invasion that preceded the first gulf war. They said the former soldier had been trying to sell the painting and that it was seized in a raid on his house in Hillah, about 60 miles south of Baghdad. The painting was said to have Picasso’s signature and the stamps of the Kuwaiti museum as well as the Louvre. But a Louvre official told The A.P. that it has never had a Picasso in its collection and does not sell its works because they are government property. The Art Loss Register in London told The A.P. it had no record of any paintings missing from the Kuwait National Museum, and no record of this particular painting as missing."

In a news release on Thursday, publicists for U2 said that the group’s concert scheduled at the stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. for Sept. 25 has been moved to Sept. 23. The change was made after the New York Jets rescheduled their Sept. 27 football game against the Tennessee Titans to 1 p.m. from 4:15 pm to avoid a conflict with Yom Kippur, which starts at sundown that day. In their release, U2’s publicists said that the staging installation for the band’s tour requires up to two days to disassemble, and the new game time made it “logistically impossible” for the installation to be broken down between a Friday night concert and a Sunday early afternoon game. The release added: “In order to accommodate the New York Jets, the NFL and the state of New Jersey, which owns the stadium, and out of respect for U2 and Jets’ fans of Jewish faith, U2 agreed to move their show rather than pursue other options.”"

2009-08-27T00:00:00Z,"Take that, J. K. Rowling, and step off, Stephenie Meyer: Lemony Snicket, the sinister pseudonym of Daniel Handler and the author of the bestselling “Series of Unfortunate Events” sequence, will write a new four-book series, BBC News reported. The Gothic “Unfortunate Events” novels about the Baudelaire orphans, which started in 1999 with “The Bad Beginning” and apparently ended in 2006 with “The End,” have sold more than 60 million copies worldwide. The series’s British publisher, Egmont Press, said that it would begin releasing the new books, whose titles were not given, in 2012. Mr. Handler told the BBC: “I can neither confirm nor deny that I have begun research into a new case, and I can neither confirm nor deny that the results are as dreadful and unnerving as ‘A Series 0f Unfortunate Events.’ However I can confirm that Egmont will be publishing these findings.” A publicist for HarperCollins Children’s Books, which releases the “Unfortunate Events” novels in the United States, said that Mr. Handler was working on the new Lemony Snicket books with his longtime editor Susan Rich, but that North American rights for them had not yet been determined."
2009-08-27T00:00:00Z,"A judge sentenced the R&B singer Chris Brown, below, on Tuesday to five years of probation and six months of community labor for assaulting the pop star Rihanna, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Brown will be allowed to serve his sentence in his home state, Virginia, but will have to make return trips to Los Angeles to update a judge on his progress. Mr. Brown pleaded guilty in June to one count of felony assault on Rihanna, a charge that stemmed from an incident on the morning of Feb. 8 when the two fought in Mr. Brown’s car. He had also been charged with making criminal threats, and could have faced up to five years in prison if found guilty on all charges. Judge Patricia Schnegg of Los Angeles County Superior Court ordered Mr. Brown to stay 100 yards away from Rihanna, except at industry events, where he can be within 10 yards. The judge also reminded Mr. Brown that any violation of his probation “comes with the potential for state prison.”."

Mr. Crawford had killed his new wife, Lechea, 30, and her sister, Rose Stevens, 25. Before fleeing, Mr. Crawford, 33, also shot Ms. Stevens's three small children, killing all of them.

Mr. Bendheim lived in Greenwich, and had a home in Lyford Cay, Nassau.

The Foundation bears the name of Mr. Bendheim's uncle, Leon Lowenstein, who started the Foundation in 1941. The Foundation's principal grants are for medical research and education. Over the years, large grants have been given to Mt. Sinai, Columbia Presbyterian, and Sloan Kettering medical centers, and in education, to Princeton and Fordham universities, the Wharton School of Economics, and programs for improvement of the New York City public schools. Mr. Bendheim graduated from Princeton University in 1937 and attended the Harvard Business School. He served in the United States Navy as a lieutenant from 1942 to 1946, and he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Fordham University in 1966. He was on the Board of Trustees of Mt. Sinai Hospital, the Boards of Fordham University, and United Way of New York, and served on various committees of Princeton University.

''Get in shape without ever setting foot in a gym'' is the trademark slogan for Skechers Shape Ups, which say they are designed to ''firm calf and buttock muscles'' and ''reduce cellulite and tone your thighs.'' Other manufacturers make similar claims for their products, which fall into a category called ''functional footwear.'' Generally speaking, these shoes work by creating a slightly uneven platform for the foot, theoretically forcing the leg, buttock and back muscles to exert more energy while walking or at rest.

The group, which says on its Web site that it is “dedicated to education about seafood safety, sustainability, and nutrition,” wrote in a statement that it cautions the news media “to treat Piven’s statements with skepticism.” The statement continued: “It is important to note that no peer reviewed medical journal has ever published any evidence of a case of methylmercury poisoning caused by the normal consumption of commercial seafood in the U.S. This ruling does not change that simple scientific fact.” Mr. Piven has said that his habit of eating fish twice a day for 20 years contributed to the mercury poisoning he said he suffered during the Broadway run of “Speed-the-Plow,” which left him exhausted, disoriented and fearing for his life."

2009-08-28T12:09:00Z,"The makers of a coming film adapted from Naomi Klein‘s book “The Shock Doctrine” probably knew that it would provoke arguments, but not like this: The Independent of London reported that Ms. Klein had withdrawn from participation in the film, and does not appear in its credits as a writer or consultant, or act as its narrator. In the book, Ms. Klein writes about how countries that have suffered wars, terror attacks or natural disasters are taken advantage of by politicians and corporations, finding examples everywhere from post-apartheid South Africa to post-9/11 America. A film adaptation directed by Michael Winterbottom (whose films include “A Mighty Heart”) and Mat Whitecross had its premiere at the Berlin Film Festival and is to be shown on Britain’s Channel 4 on Tuesday. But Ms. Klein told The Independent she had disagreed with Mr. Winterbottom over “the content, tone and structure of the film.” “As often happens, we had different ideas about how to tell this story and build the argument,” she said. “This is Michael’s adaptation of my book, and I didn’t want there to be any confusion about that.

The cast features Quentin Earl Darrington as Coalhouse Walker Jr. and Stephanie Umoh as Sarah, both making their Broadway debuts, as well as Ron Bohmer (&#8220;The Phantom of the Opera&#8221;) as Father, Christiane Noll (&#8220;Urinetown&#8221;) as Mother and Robert Petkoff (&#8220;Spamalot&#8221;) as Tateh.

Washington) and, from &#8220;Rock of Ages,&#8221; Savannah Wise (Evelyn Nesbit). The musical, which ran at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington in the spring, is directed and choreographed by Marcia Milgrom Dodge and is adapted from the E. L. Doctorow novel with a book by Terrence McNally, music by Stephen Flaherty and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens. It is to begin previews on Oct. 23 and open on Nov. 15. ...

An official at the Ministry of Information, Communication and Culture in Malaysia told The A.P. that government regulations normally prevent alcohol companies from staging concerts, but that an exception had been made in hopes of increasing tourism. &#8220;Muslims cannot attend,&#8221; the official said. &#8220;Non-Muslims can go and have fun.&#8221; Recent concerts in Malaysia featuring the singers Gwen Stefani, Avril Lavigne and Beyonc&#233; have drawn the ire of conservative Muslims, who protested the singers&#8217; revealing costumes."

The donation will be made public on Friday before a memorial service at the Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ, the site of Till&#8217;s funeral. The 14-year-old Till was killed by white men while visiting the house of his great-uncle Moses Wright in Money, Miss., after he was perceived to have offended a white woman. His mother, Mamie Till Mobley, decided to have her son presented in an open casket so the world could see what had been done to him. Till&#8217;s body was exhumed from the Burr Oak Cemetery in suburban Chicago in 2005 during another criminal investigation into his murder, and Till was reburied in another coffin. The National Museum of African American History and Culture is scheduled to open on the Mall in 2015.

Born in Przemysl and raised in Katowice, Poland, he attended university in Vienna where he spoke Polish, German, French, English, and competed as a Grand Prix auto racer, driving for Team Citroen before WWII forced him to flee. Ulryk embraced life and savored adventure, competition and conquest. He was passionate about cars, tennis and family. On September 1, 1939 when Germany bombed and invaded Poland, Ulryk instinctively escaped with his wife, Saree, driving to Rumania minutes before advancing German troops closed the Polish border. Only 26 years old, he navigated the chaos of Europe, miraculously obtained a visa to the US, and secured passage from Genoa, Italy on the Saturnia. They arrived in New York Harbor on Columbus Day 1939, homeless and penniless. From Ellis Island they were thrust into the Bronx, where Ulryk found work cleaning toilets. He found distant relatives in Woodbridge, NJ who owned a dairy farm and moved again. In 1940, he succeeded in what he considered his life's biggest accomplishment: Ulryk secured his parents' safe passage out of Poland and entry to Dominican Republic until he obtained their visas to enter the US in 1941. He worked hard and played hard, driving a milk truck to make pre-dawn home deliveries, and playing tennis in the afternoons at the public courts in Perth Amboy. He later turned his passion for cars into a business. In 1954 he became the first Chevrolet dealer in Middlesex County, NJ. After 42 years of owning June Chevrolet, he retired at age 84 and moved from Metuchen, NJ to Boca Raton, FL. Ulryk was predeceased by Saree, his wife of 65 years, and is survived by his daughter, June Eichbaum and son-in-law, Ken Wirfel and grandchildren, Hannah and Mikhaila Wirfel."

But Alison Ward, right, hopes to draw at least some oglers on Saturday with her performance piece ''The Beastly Beauty.''

It involves dozens of performers done up in costumes that are equal parts revealing and froufrou, divided into teams that represent the beautiful and the grotesque. Naturally they must battle, with cheerleading-style rallying cries, military call-and-response and burlesque dance moves. Also, naturally, it's the men who represent beauty, and the women, mostly, who do grotesque."

However, for The Times to remain the great paper it is, she should be treasured for her sharp tongue and biting wit. Wasn't H.L. Mencken a fine journalist? Or Tom Wolfe back in the Herald-Tribune days? They were far worse than Cintra. No - the bite is the crushed red pepper in the spaghetti sauce. Please don't dumb her down.JEFF COXKenwood, Calif., Aug. 23, 2009 ●I take issue with your mea culpa on Cintra Wilson's cutting review of the new Penney's Manhattan store. I live in the hinterlands, and I found it accurate and humorous. I used it to illustrate to a friend the workings of fashion snobbery and symbolism. Ms. Wilson has a particular point of view, tongue firmly in her cheek, and she fully aired the inherent conflict between country and city, polyester and silk. Embedded in her satire were tough truths about quality and mass merchandising. I buy The Times for just this level of vivid insight.NAOMI C. DALLOBCincinnati, Aug. 23, 2009 ●I am a Midwestern woman and a size 12. I was quite interested to learn that both of those attributes are laughable.I also am a longtime Times subscriber. I now fear that my public fondness for The Times may prove embarrassing to your staff. Would it diminish their embarrassment if I canceled my subscription?ELIZABETH AUSTINChicago, Aug. 24, 2009●●Re ""Baseball's Top-Secret Roster"" (Aug. 9):I don't think you address one important aspect of the situation, that being the prosecutors or others who revealed information that was sealed under a court order. To me this is a more serious crime than a ballplayer taking steroids. Illegally and unethically leaking confidential information seems to be getting more and more prevalent. The fact is that The Times and other newspapers are often accessories to this crime. Can you justify this in this case? After all, it isn't the Pentagon Papers. In my humble opinion, journalists need to set the bar quite a bit higher.JACK ACKERMANGarwood, N.J., Aug. 9, 2009 ●While I agree with your assessment concerning the pursuit of sealed orders by The New York Times, and I understand the need of your paper to pursue and publish relevant information regarding any institution, I feel you are publishing salacious and slanderous pieces that are unsubstantiated. Your reporter pursued names at the expense of the larger story and ignored facts that were not only relevant but also imperative to the truthfulness of the report. David Ortiz, Manny Ramirez and Sammy Sosa could have tested positive for legal, over-the-counter supplements, which were not banned under the collective bargaining agreement agreed upon by Major League Baseball and the players' union. You wrote, ""But one of a newspaper's fundamental obligations is to examine the integrity of institutions, including baseball,"" and I cannot help to think about the hypocrisy of such a statement when your own reporters are publishing reports that may be completely and totally incorrect. Slander sells for the Enquirer; truth and facts should be the priority for the Times.COREY HOEHNBoston, Aug. 10, 2009 ●One issue you did not tackle in your thoughtful discussion of the drug test ""list"" is the use of data collected from a one-shot ""survey"" to draw conclusions about individuals. Nearly any test for drug usage will have both false negatives and false positives, especially if the test is supposed to detect so many different drugs. False results may not be a big problem if the aim of the tests was to get a rough estimate the proportion of players who were using steroids and other performance enhancing drugs, and if the false positives and false negatives were expected (based on trials) to occur in approximately equal numbers. But it's another matter if you try to use the tests to say something about individuals. Right now, all we know is that some people are falsely accused, and some are falsely given a free pass - and that the public has no idea how big or small these errors are when making judgments about individual players. New York Times reporters talk about error rates in public opinion samples. Why don't they discuss errors and their implications in this context?TOM GAISWilliamstown, Mass., Aug. 11, 2009 ●You forgot to address what some of us think is the most important issue: who is the source of these leaks - which, as I understand it, are 100 percent illegal and unethical - and why are they doing it? Why not prompt The Times to investigate that issue? After all, The times has an inside track - it dealt with them (whoever they are).GERALD GLASSERWestfield, N.J.. Aug. 9, 2009 ●I think people are missing the point about the so-called list: the players were promised confidentiality and anonymity; otherwise, they never would have agreed to the testing. That Alex Rodriguez's rights were violated is no excuse for violating David Ortiz's. I don't have a problem with the press printing news, but whoever is leaking these names is not only violating the law, but is also destroying something of inestimable value: fundamental trust in each other will be destroyed. And for what? The names of players who may have taken something that at the time - six years ago - was not yet prohibited in their sport. Is it really worth undermining the social contract for such out-of-date and unreliable information?TOM BECKEast Windsor, N.J., Aug. 9, 2009●●Re ""How Did This Happen?"" (Aug. 2):Embarrassing as the error corrections must have been for your editors, I think they are symptomatic of a much greater problem. Frankly, The Times has become fraught with errors, not nearly so much in its print version as on its Web site. More important, you seem to be losing your journalistic soul as the organization slips into being more of an Internet news blog than a serious publication.Back when your Web site was only giving away the newspaper's content for free, it was simply undermining your business model. Now, the Web site increasingly controls the paper's content, and the slapdash nature of 24/7 Web reporting (and blogging) has carried over into print. Worse, any real ""news"" on the Web site is increasingly overshadowed by the opinionated blogs presented there. So much for being ""the newspaper of record."" I'm not sure why The Times chose to use its Web site to destroy its newspaper, but that is very much what is happening.GEORGE SCHNEPFManhattan, Aug. 2, 2009 ●I strongly believe writing or editing for a newspaper today no longer has the professional and personal pressure that it did in yesteryear. At 72, I can still vividly recall what it was like to be the equivalent of an apprentice.While in college, I became a stringer for The Trentonian. The city editor, Clyde Lieb, and others taught me to take my first copy off the press and check my work to see if it could have been done better, and then to look at the other guys' work. In addition, the noise of a dozen typewriters and six teletype machines added to the ambiance of urgency and importance. We all believed that what we wrote had to be correct, not only factually but in the proper use of the American idiom of the English language, because we set the example for our readers.Then there was that feeling of pride when your byline appeared, which wasn't very often on The Trentonian in the late '50s. I got two in three years.Walk into a newsroom today and the air is clean and smoke-free, the room is quiet, and there's no aura of urgency, no friendly competitive atmosphere, and I daresay probably no sense of accomplishment by most of the personnel when the bell rings and the press rolls.LEE MALTENFORTSavannah, Ga., Aug. 2, 2009 ●In your analysis of Alessandra Stanley's error-riddled story about Walter Cronkite, why was there no mention of one other factor: the reduction in staff at The Times and the obvious trend seen in the newspaper industry of fewer reporters and copy editors being forced to do more work, thus resulting in a lesser product?As a former newspaper reporter with 25 years in the industry, I know this is a problem nationwide. Newspaper staffs are being slashed to the bone, or the marrow in some instances, and the remaining staff is told to ""do more with less."" Overworked staffers, declining morale and glaring problems like Ms. Stanley's horrendous errors (compounded by editors' failing in their roles) only chip away at the foundations of journalism.ALAN CLEMONSHampton Cove, Ala., Aug. 2, 2009"

''Our country has lost a great leader, who picked up the torch of his fallen brothers and became the greatest United States senator of our time.'' What Mr. Obama didn't say -- and perhaps didn't need to -- was that the closed chapter was the vision of liberalism begun by the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, extended during the Great Society of Lyndon B. Johnson and now struggling back toward relevance. It holds that the forces of government should be marshaled to improve conditions for the greatest possible number of Americans, with particular emphasis on the excluded and disadvantaged. It is not government's only obligation, in this view, but it is the paramount one."

2009-08-30T00:00:00Z,"New York secretes its fullest range of smells in the summer; disgusting or enticing, delicate or overpowering, they are liberated by the heat. So one sweltering weekend, I set out to navigate the city by nose. As my nostrils led me from Manhattan's northernmost end to its southern tip, some prosaic scents recurred (cigarette butts; suntan lotion; fried foods); some were singular and sublime (a delicate trail of flowers mingling with Indian curry around 34th Street); while others proved revoltingly unique (the garbage outside a nail salon). Some smells reminded me of other places, and some will forever remind me of New York. FORT GEORGE, THE CLOISTERS"

But not Piet Breinholm, a former drummer for the Berlin-based trio 18th Dye, who transformed the once-ubiquitous leather school bag used by Danish children into a chic unisex accessory called The Last Bag (above). It is made entirely in Denmark, and comes in two sizes and a range of school's-out colors: yellow, orange, emerald and color-block combinations. Laptops, cellphones and other trappings of mature homework all fit comfortably in this durable carryall that lives up to its name as the last bag you'll ever need; pietbreinholm.dk.

BEHIND THE NEWS With their revenue eroded by the economic downturn, many firms deferred some of their 2008 hiring into 2009, leaving little room for new recruits this year. Universities like Yale, Georgetown and Northwestern say interviews are down by one-third to one-half, and some major firms say they are doing no recruiting at all this year as they rethink how they fill their ranks."

2009-08-30T00:00:00Z,"WHEN Gideon Rubin draws a blank, he is not befuddled. Rather, he is masking the face of a stranger whose photo he has found in a vintage album. He discovers these albums around the world, then paints sweet-looking portraits that evoke the innocence of a children's storybook, though his subjects have no faces. ''I paint from objects that have life and layers -- things that tell a story,'' said the 36-year-old London-based artist, whose grandfather is the Israeli painter Reuven Rubin and whose fashion-world fans include the designer Narciso Rodriguez. For ''Mexican Summer,'' his solo show Sept. 8 to Oct. 17 at the Hosfelt Gallery in San Francisco, Mr. Rubin painted a faceless European family living in a Mexican village around 1920. He was drawn to them, he said, because they felt out of place. ''I was inspired by what they were wearing, what they were doing, how the two cultures interacted with each other,'' he said. ''But mainly, I was inspired to paint the two kids, a brother and sister.'' KRISTOPHER HOUSER"
2009-08-30T00:00:00Z,"THINK AGAIN If I have no problem with alternative ways of teaching literature or history, how can I maintain (with the American College of Trustees and Alumni) that there is only one way to teach writing? Easy. It can't be an alternative way of teaching writing to teach something else (like multiculturalism or social justice). It can, however, be an alternative way of teaching history to forgo a broad chronological narrative and confine yourself to a single period or even to a single world-changing event. It is the difference between not doing the job and getting the job done by another route. This difference is blurred in the ACTA report because it is running (and conflating) two arguments. One argument (with which I agree) says teach the subject matter and don't adulterate it with substitutes. The other argument says teach the subject matter so that it points in a particular ideological direction, the direction of traditional values and a stable canon. The first argument is methodological and implies no particular politics; the other is political through and through, and it is the argument the authors are finally committed to because they see themselves as culture warriors. The battle they are fighting in the report is over the core curriculum, the defense of which is for them a moral as well as an educational imperative, as it is for those who oppose it."

2009-08-30T00:00:00Z,"Independents The only one of these teams that has any real B.C.S. aspirations is Notre Dame, and the only thing making those aspirations possible is a schedule featuring two teams that finished in the Top 25 last season. And both those games (Michigan State and Southern California) are in South Bend. The Irish will be dangerous on offense with Jimmy Clausen. He will be throwing to a group of quality receivers, led by Michael Floyd and Golden Tate. Most of the offensive line returns, which could help make the running game more consistent. On defense, the secondary will have to be strong in order to give the front time to gel. Notre Dame may not be beating U.S.C. in October, but if the pieces fall into place, the Irish could make a run at a B.C.S. bowl. At Navy, Coach Ken Niumatalolo helped the Midshipmen win their sixth consecutive Commander-in-Chief's Trophy -- and go to a sixth straight bowl game -- in his first season last year. Quarterback Ricky Dobbs will be leading the triple-option attack, always one of the most prolific offenses in the country. Coach Rich Ellerson takes over at Army, where he has installed the double-eagle flex defense (which he popularized at Arizona) to take advantage of his team's speed and aggressiveness.

2009-08-30T00:00:00Z,"EICHBAUM--Ulryk, 96, died on August 26. Born in Przemysl and raised in Katowice, Poland, he attended university in Vienna where he spoke Polish, German, French, English, and competed as a Grand Prix auto racer, driving for Team Citroen before WWII forced him to flee. Ulryk embraced life and savored adventure, competition and conquest. He was passionate about cars, tennis and family. On September 1, 1939 when Germany bombed and invaded Poland, Ulryk instinctively escaped with his wife, Saree, driving to Rumania minutes before advancing German troops closed the Polish border. Only 26 years old, he navigated the chaos of Europe, miraculously obtained a visa to the US, and secured passage from Genoa, Italy on the Saturnia. They arrived in New York Harbor on Columbus Day 1939, homeless and penniless. From Ellis Island they were thrust into the Bronx, where Ulryk found work cleaning toilets. He found distant relatives in Woodbridge, NJ who owned a dairy farm and moved again. In 1940, he succeeded in what he considered his life's biggest accomplishment: Ulryk secured his parents' safe passage out of Poland and entry to Dominican Republic until he obtained their visas to enter the US in 1941. He worked hard and played hard, driving a milk truck to make pre-dawn home deliveries, and playing tennis in the afternoons at the public courts in Perth Amboy. He later turned his passion for cars into a business. In 1954 he became the first Chevrolet dealer in Middlesex County, NJ. After 42 years of owning June Chevrolet, he retired at age 84 and moved from Metuchen, NJ to Boca Raton, FL. Ulryk was predeceased by Saree, his wife of 65 years, and is survived by his daughter, June Eichbaum and son-in-law, Ken Wirfel and grandchildren, Hannah and Mikhaila Wirfel."

Just when it seemed like Virginia Tech could assume that role, it lost running back Darren Evans (1,265 yards as a freshman) to a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Even with Evans on the sideline, the Hokies are still the team to beat. Quarterback Tyrod Taylor seems poised for a breakout season. The Hokies also have a typically nasty defense led by end Jason Worilds and cornerback Stephan Virgil. Virginia Tech faces Alabama (in Atlanta) and hosts Nebraska in the first three weeks of the season. How the Hokies do in those games will speak to where the conference stands. Georgia Tech running back Jonathan Dwyer is a Heisman candidate in Paul Johnson's dangerous spread-option attack. Miami finished one game back in the division last season and ought to be better this year. North Carolina might be a season away from competing for a title. In the Atlantic Division, quarterback Christian Ponder and a veteran offensive line make Florida State the favorite. North Carolina State quarterback Russell Wilson is one of the most exciting players in the nation."

Houston has the better chance of the two, though its offense will need to outscore both Oklahoma State and Texas Tech in nonconference play, a tall order. Houston's biggest rival in the West division is Tulsa, whose deep receiver corps is the best in the conference. Damaris Johnson, for example, has the potential to lead the Golden Hurricane in both receiving and rushing. Texas-El Paso will welcome back safety Braxton Amy, who missed last season after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament. His presence will boost a questionable defense. Southern Methodist could take a big step forward in June Jones's second season, but the Mustangs still appear a year away from challenging for the West division crown. East Carolina won the league last season coming out of the East division, but will be tested by Southern Mississippi. The Golden Eagles have a rising star in wide receiver DeAndre Brown.

His surviving family members, sister Stephanie and her husband Seth Alpert, were at his side. Simons' drawings and paintings had a stream of conscious element. They were often informed by the lyrical riffs of a jazz musician, or of an improvisational poet, incorporating Simons multiple creative talents. Like the blues that he loved, his palette was dark and moody, with explosions of color. He displayed a felicitous genius for accidental events: a coffee spill, ink blot, bits of detritus, phone bill, a paper cup or cigarette butt could each be reconfigured and incorporated into his drawings. Barry Simons struggled with accepting his great success. He had said he was on a ""quest to release the visionary artist I felt living inside me. So far, the journey has led me through many rented rooms and coffee shops. I'm still looking for that one free refill of coffee with a picture of Rembrandt on the napkin."" His work is included in numerous private collections, and in The Oakland Museum of California, The International Folk Art Museum of Santa Fe, The Milwaukee Art Museum, and Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art in Chicago.

Its before-dark appearance calls to mind a remark made by the California designer Rudi Gernreich on a visit to New York in 1970. Then, the miniskirt was at its height, and Courrèges's space-age dressing was avant-garde, and Mr. Gernreich exclaimed: ''They're wearing their evening dresses in the daytime in New York!'' Mr. Gernreich, known for the topless bathing suit, was all about freeing women for modern life, and ankle-length skirts were not his idea of liberating design. But this summer proved once again that the customer is the ultimate judge of what passes for fashion, and this year, she is in a romantic mood. Many of the dresses are in fluid jersey or cotton. Prints abound, and there is a strong trend for bold bands of color, and of course, black. Belts are rare, but a taxicab-yellow cinch stood out."

2009-08-30T00:00:00Z,"Most of this city's modern apartment buildings have pools, but sadly, most of its hotels do not. So if you feel the urge to get wet, you can either make friends with a resident or grab your bathing suit and head to Casa de Campo, the city's largest park, where one of the city's most luxurious public pool complexes spreads out over several acres. The ambience at the Centro Municipal Deportivo Casa de Campo (Paseo Puerta del Angel 7; 34-91-463-0050) has more in common with a university aquatics center than one of those urban ''beaches'' of sizzling concrete and chain-link fence. At Campo, towering cypress and cedar trees shade some of the grassy knolls where visitors spread their towels to take a siesta between laps or after lunch."

Beyond high-profile partnerships with the likes of Richard Prince and Takashi Murakami, what ''Art, Fashion and Architecture'' reveals are 80 lesser-known folies à deux. That would include the minimalist Sol LeWitt, who designed silk scarves (left) in the 1980s; the architect Jun Aoki, whose brilliant Tokyo stores (the one in the Ginza is at right) risk eclipsing the contents inside; and the provocateur Vanessa Beecroft, whose naked performance piece was staged for a Vuitton flagship's grand opening on the Champs-Élysées.

2009-08-31T11:09:42Z,"More than 40 years after the guitarist Brian Jones, a founding member of the Rolling Stones, was found dead at the bottom of his swimming pool, British police have said they will reexamine the case after receiving new information from an investigative journalist, Reuters reported. Jones, a bohemian blues musician who helped create the Rolling Stones in 1962 (and is said to have come up with the group’s name, taken from the Muddy Waters song “Rollin’ Stone Blues”), was found dead on July 3, 1969, at a home in East Sussex that once belonged to A. A. Milne. At that time, Jones had recently left the band, and a coroner’s report gave the official cause for his demise as “death by misadventure,” though subsequent films and books (including “The Murder of Brian Jones” by Anna Wohlin, a girlfriend of Jones who was with him when he died) have suggested that foul play was involved. British officials did not say what new information they had received or who had given it to them. But a spokesman for the Sussex police told Reuters, “These papers will be examined by Sussex Police but it is too early to comment at this time on what the outcome will be.”Read The New York Times’s original report on the death of Brian Jones from July 3, 1969.

2009-08-31T11:45:24Z,"A day after Noel Gallagher (sort of) stunned fans with his announcement that he was quitting the popular British rock band Oasis, Mr. Gallagher explained his departure to fans in a statement on the group’s official Web site, oasisinet.com, Agence France-Press reported. In the statement, Mr. Gallagher, the group’s lead guitarist and main songwriter, said that he had been “forced to leave” Oasis, adding that “the level of verbal and violent intimidation towards me, my family, friends and comrades has become intolerable” and “the lack of support and understanding from my management and band mates” left him with no other option. Mr. Gallagher announced his departure from the band in a brief statement that was issued on Friday night, just before Oasis was to perform at the Rock en Seine festival near Paris. Concert organizers said at the time that Mr. Gallagher had fought with his brother, Liam, the group’s lead singer, with whom he has had a notoriously stormy relationship over the band’s 18-year run."

2009-08-31T12:47:24Z,"Book lovers who were hoping for a decisive showdown between the authors Alice Munro and Margaret Atwood in the Scotiabank Giller Prize, the annual Canadian literary award, were disappointed when Ms. Munro said she did not want to be considered for the prize this year, The Globe and Mail reported. Ms. Munro, whose new short story collection “Too Much Happiness” was seen as a likely nominee for the prize, said she was withdrawing the book from consideration because she has won it twice before, for her collections “The Love of a Good Woman” (in 1998) and “Runaway” (in 2004). Douglas Gibson, whose Douglas Gibson Books imprint releases Ms. Munro’s work in Canada, told The Globe and Mail: “In my role as greedy publisher I pointed out that the Giller Prize produces so much publicity, that even to be nominated for it is tremendous publicity. But her mind is made up on this.” The Giller Prize, of about $45,000, is awarded annually to a Canadian work of fiction; the longlist of nominees for the 2009 prize will be announced on Oct. 6. “Too Much Happiness” is to be released in the United States in November."

2009-08-31T16:24:42Z,"As much as I adore reality TV, even I sometimes have to wonder how much participants are playing to the camera. Last week, I had the chance to sit down with two cast members of ""Flipping Out"" (Bravo, Tuesdays at 10 p.m.), and I'm happy to say they are exactly as they seem on the show. Which is to say, completely nutty and sympathetic and fascinating all at once. ""Flipping Out"" chronicles the life and work of Jeff Lewis, who, in Seasons 1 and 2, renovated properties and then sold them at a profit but, in Season 3, thanks to the economic downturn, is now consulting clients on their renovations. Part of the hook of the show is that Lewis is detail-orientated about his business and his life to the point of obsession and of being a total terror to his employees. There's his long-suffering assistant, Jenni Pulos; his long-suffering housekeeper, Zoila Chavez; and his just-joined-the-team design intern, Trace Lehnhoff. The jury is still out on how long he's going to suffer.In person, Lewis is personable and has a great sense of humor, but he is also exacting, the sort of person I would want as a therapist or a personal trainer. He ordered an Arnold Palmer (half iced tea and half lemonade) and even tried it with pink lemonade after the waitress had to adjust his order. Most of the jokes revolved around the newly single Jenni, though he did note how strange it was to go from talking business with CNN to talking Botox with Wendy Williams. Pulos is absolutely charming, sweet and funny, and she made me wish I had someone worthy for her to date. Alas, that first meeting is now lost to a faulty tape recorder, but Lewis and crew were kind enough to answer some questions over email."

In another crime incident, the police pulled over a car with bad front-end damage on Thursday night, and determined that the driver, a 17-year-old resident, had not been involved as suspected in an earlier incident.

Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1924, Dr. Shimamoto served during World War II with the Army Signal Corps in Washington, DC, and the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey in Japan.

From 1964 to 1975, Dr. Shimamoto served as chairman of the Applied Mathematics Department at Brookhaven, responsible for management of research in mathematics and computer science. In this capacity, he also managed the laboratory's central scientific computing facility and oversaw the funding, procurement, and development of a laboratory-wide computer network. After resigning as chairman at the end of the first year of a third five-year term, Shimamoto devoted himself to research in combinatorial mathematics, the economics of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas lease sales (on behalf of the U.S. Geological Survey), the architecture of supercomputers, and the linking of computers for parallel processing.

The traditional advice has been to swim parallel to the shore in order to get outside the current. But after an extensive study of these currents -- by using instruments and floating in them himself -- Jamie MacMahan has concluded that your odds are better if you stay still and just tread water.Dr. MacMahan, an oceanography professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., found that the conventional image of a rip current is inaccurate -- that it's actually not a long plume of fast-moving water running out to sea. Instead, rip currents more closely resemble whirlpools, with strong, persistent eddies that circulate throughout the surf zone, Dr. MacMahan reports in an article to be published in Marine Geology. If you swim parallel to the shore, he concludes, there's a 50-percent chance you'll end up be swimming into a stronger current. But if you just tread water, he says, there's a 90 percent chance of being returned to shore within about three minutes."

It was enough to make a guy reconsider his wardrobe's spectrum. And while a full two-piece suit in burnt sienna is a few Pantone chips beyond my comfort zone, I'm already thinking about how to wear orange for fall. A bright shade - say, in the form of a sweater - is great to liven up a charcoal double-breasted suit; while a more subdued tone of orange can stand in anywhere camel works. And lest you end up looking like a jack-o'-lantern, one incontestable rule is to never wear orange with black."

Tampa Bay co-owner Len Barrie is accused of misappropriating funds from his British Columbia golf resort to help pay for his purchase of the Lightning. According to a report from the Bear Mountain Resort's former accounting firm, Barrie used at least $2.5 million to help pay for the club as part of a number of transactions the firm says may have been ""improper and, in some cases, illegal."" The Globe and Mail reports that Allan Neale, a partner at the firm who served as the resort's auditor, expressed his concerns to resort management and resigned from the job. Barrie, who is involved in an ownership and payment dispute with Tampa partner Oren Koules that is being mediated by Commissioner Gary Bettman, denies the accusation and tells the newspaper that the resort's new auditing company ""agrees with how I've done it so I don't think there is any issue.""• • •Ice Edge Holdings, one of three bidders for the bankrupt Phoenix Coyotes, has booked ice at Saskatoon's Credit Union Centre to stage five Coyotes games if the group's $150 million bid wins the Sept. 10 auction for the team.

Melnyk, who was outraged last week when Balsillie's lawyers pointed out that Melnyk had paid fines for securities violations, says he long ago advised Balsillie, ""I don't think you knock the door down to try to get a team."" Melnyk's comments come on the eve of a key Sept. 2 hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix in which Judge Redfield T. Baum is expected to rule on whether Balsillie can participate in the Sept. 10 auction for the Coyotes.• • •Former N.H.L. Players Association director of business affairs Vincent Damphousse says that union head Paul Kelly was dismissed Monday morning because of ""a kind of paranoia in the group."" Damphousse, who left his union job a few months before Kelly came aboard in 2007, characterizes the firing as the latest chapter in a struggle within the N.H.L.P.A. membership between hardliners and accommodationists. Damphousse says there is a push to leave behind Kelly's cooperative stance with league management and return to the confrontational approach of Bob Goodenow, who headed the union for 13 years culminating in the 2004-05 lockout."

2009-09-01T04:25:41Z,"Last week, I heard about the opening of a new shop in Reykjavik, Iceland, called the Armoury. It's the brainchild of the designer Sruli Recht and the artist Megan Herbert, and it's in a part of the Icelandic capital they're calling the fishpacking district. Which gives me a chuckle because a) center-city Reykjavik is barely large enough to be subdivided in the first place, and b) if Recht and Herbert are looking to capture a similar frisson of industria as Manhattan's meatpacking district, well, that neighborhood lost its frisson five years ago (if not before, in my worthless opinion).But anyway, who cares? Reykjavik designers and shop owners have proved themselves to be thriving and shrewd, economic woes notwithstanding, and they can be as creative with nomenclature as they like. Not long ago the city christened its main shopping street a ""design district,"" and Icelandic Fashion Week kicks off in the capital for the ninth time on Thursday. For his part, Recht, who was born in Israel, is something of an enfant terrible, with a goth-dandyish ethos that has won him international acclaim but hasn't taken him far from the spirit of his adopted city. Check out his whalets - wallets made of minke whale or Nile perch skin - or his luxuriously shroudlike blankoat sweater knitted from Icelandic wool. And I'm obsessed with his bow tie (below) and its backstory. At the new shop, these and other ""nonproducts"" - a new one every month - will sit alongside Herbert's illustrated paper-cut works. If you don't plan on being in Iceland anytime soon, some of Recht's pieces are available at BBlessing in New York and at Isetan in Tokyo."

Jones, who helped create the Rolling Stones in 1962 (and is said to have come up with the group&#8217;s name, taken from a Muddy Waters song), was found dead on July 3, 1969, at his East Sussex home, which once belonged to A. A. Milne. At that time Jones had recently left the band. A coroner&#8217;s report gave the official cause as &#8220;death by misadventure,&#8221; though subsequent films and books (including &#8220;The Murder of Brian Jones&#8221; by Anna Wohlin, a girlfriend of Jones who was with him the night he died) have suggested that foul play was involved.

2009-09-01T00:00:00Z,"The Brazilian government on Monday presented proposed changes to laws to assign the primary role of developing key deep-sea oil reserves to the state-run energy giant Petrobras, a move that would come at the expense of foreign rivals. The new regulatory framework would be a nationalistic shift for Brazil, which has discovered deep-sea fields in the past two years that Petrobras says could hold tens of billions of barrels of crude oil. That would more than double Brazil's proven reserves of 14.1 billion barrels. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said in his weekly radio broadcast that the new arrangement would represent a ''new Independence Day'' for Brazil. The proposal, which needs congressional approval, would confine foreign companies to mostly subservient roles to Petrobras and a new state-owned oil company. The government also said it would establish a special fund to ensure that future oil revenues were regularly funneled to education and poverty reduction."

Ms. Blanchett, who is portraying Blanche DuBois in a production for the the Sydney Theater Company, was performing a fight scene with Joel Edgerton, who is playing Stanley Kowalski. During the scene, Ms. Blanchett was accidentally struck on the head by a prop radio held by Mr. Edgerton. Agence France-Presse quoted audience members as saying that Ms. Blanchett continued to act in the scene, but she had blood on her head and on her neck. The house lights in the theater were then turned on and the audience was asked to leave the building. It was later announced that the performance had been canceled. Tim McKeough, a spokesman for the theater, said that Ms. Blanchett was “absolutely fine” and was expected back for Thursday night’s performance."

2009-09-02T10:11:52Z,"Back when the world was awash with money, fashion became more expensive even as the word ""luxury"" was cheapened. Bontoni men's shoes are a reassuring reminder that purchasing an investment is still possible. The third-generation Italian company traces its origins to Montegranaro, a medieval hilltop town in the Marche region, where Franco Gazzani's father, uncle and late grandfather made shoes with hand-stitched leather and hand-painted homemade dyes for family, friends and select customers. In 2004, Gazzani and his second cousin Lewis Cutillo decided that their shoes' rising reputation warranted an expansion. But he resisted the temptation to inflate his family name into a mass-market luxury brand. Instead, Bontoni's growth has been measured, and its quality has never been compromised. The shoes are created exactly as they were made a generation ago. Each pair of tapered dress shoes, whose signature attribute is their unique patina, requires 13 weeks to be completed from scratch. The company's team, having grown from three to six, produces 8 to 10 shoes a day in the basement of Gazzani's home. In Italy, where the sanctity of craft has evolved into an ideology like Slow Food, Bontoni sells its elegant bespoke shoes at a starting price of $4,500. Ready-to-wear shoes, priced from $1,000 to $3,500, can be purchased at Bergdorf Goodman Men in New York, Wilkes Bashford in San Francisco and equivalent retailers around the world. Bontoni will hold a trunk show at Bergdorf Goodman Men from Sept. 11 to Sept. 13."

2009-09-02T00:00:00Z,"The Allentown Art Museum in Pennsylvania has received the art collection of the Modernist artist Peter Grippe, including his own works, as well as art by Alexander Calder, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and others, The Allentown Morning Call reported. Grippe, a Cubist-inspired sculptor and printmaker who died in 2002, accumulated the collection of more than 500 works in his Long Island home and studio and New York City apartment. His works, including “The Cellist,” above, and “The City,” below, were donated to the museum by his wife, Florence Grippe, who worked with its executive director, Greg Perry, at the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University. Though Grippe’s sculptures, drawings and prints form the bulk of the collection, it also includes rare items like the portfolio “21 Etchings and Poems,” which contains work by Frank O’Hara, Dylan Thomas and de Kooning."

2009-09-02T00:00:00Z,"The Oscar process is clearly still in process. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says its decision in June to double the number of best-picture nominees to 10 brings with it a change in voting method. The best picture will now be chosen by a preferential voting system, rather than the single-choice voting used in other categories. In a statement on Monday, Tom Sherak, the new president of the academy, said preferential voting would help choose the best-picture candidate “with the strongest support of a majority of our electorate.” In the single-choice system, voters pick their film, and the one with the most votes wins. Oscar voters will now be expected to rank their best-picture choices, 1 through 10. Without such ranking, the wider field of nominees raised the possibility that a film would win top honors even it were preferred by only a small plurality of voters. The best picture was last chosen by preferential voting in 1945, the academy said."
2009-09-02T00:00:00Z,"Good news for Muslims in Malaysia, at least those who are fans of the Black Eyed Peas: concert organizers said that they could attend a performance by the band, after previously stating that the show was open only to non-Muslims, Agence France-Presse reported. A Web site for the concert, which is being held on Sept. 25 near Kuala Lumpur to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Guinness brewery in Dublin, had said that “the party is only open to non-Muslims aged 18 years and above,” and Malaysia’s Ministry of Information, Communication and Culture had said that Muslims could not attend. Of Malaysia’s 25 million people, 60 percent are Muslims; Islamic law forbids the consumption of alcohol. But the concert’s promoters, Artists World Entertainment, said in a statement that the event was now “open to all individuals aged 18 and above,” according to Agence France-Presse. No immediate reason for the change was given, though the original plan to bar Muslims from the show drew widespread attention and criticism."

2009-09-02T00:00:00Z,"Though you’ll never see Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley reunite on this plane of existence, a Broadway show that brings them together may be the next best thing. On Tuesday the producers of the musical “Million Dollar Quartet” said they planned to bring their show, based on a 1956 recording session that brought that famous foursome together at Sun Records in Memphis, to Broadway in the spring. Publicists for the musical, which is playing at the Apollo Theater in Chicago, said that the Broadway production would be directed by Eric Schaeffer. Its score comprises songs made famous by those singers, including “Blue Suede Shoes,” “Folsom Prison Blues” and “Whole Lotta’ Shakin’ Goin’ On.” No casting or theater was announced for the Broadway production. ... The wheel in the sky keeps on turning, as does the cast of the 1980s jukebox musical “Rock of Ages.” On Tuesday the show’s publicists said that Tom Lenk, a recurring actor on the television series “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” would join the Broadway musical on Sept. 14 in the role of Franz. Mr. Lenk, who previously performed the role in Los Angeles and Las Vegas productions, is replacing Wesley Taylor, who is joining the coming Broadway musical “The Addams Family.” They also said that the other principal cast members of “Rock of Ages,” including Constantine Maroulis, James Carpinello, Adam Dannheisser, Mitchell Jarvis, Michele Mais and Lauren Molina, had re-signed with the show through next summer."
2009-09-02T00:00:00Z,"Modest construction work is expected to resume on Wednesday morning at the Hilton Theater on Broadway to prepare for the new musical production “Spider-Man, Turn Off the Dark,” even though the ultimate fate of the show is still in limbo, three people involved with the production said on Tuesday. Work on “Spider-Man” was suspended in early August because of cash flow problems facing the lead producer, Hello Entertainment. Some of the show’s prospective cast members, meanwhile, were informed that the musical might be canceled altogether, according to agents for those actors. The three people involved with the production said that there was only enough new money to have a handful of workers return to the Hilton on Wednesday; actors have yet to be reassured that the musical is on, and full-scale work on the multimillion-dollar scenery is still being delayed. The people said that the difficulty of raising money to fully capitalize the show, which is expected to cost $35 million or more, has yet to be resolved. They added that the musical’s problems would not be solved by Monday’s announcement that the Walt Disney Company would acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion; the Spider-man character is a Marvel property, but Marvel (and Disney) is not expected to put significant money, if any, into the show. A publicist for “Spider-Man” said previews for the musical, directed by Julie Taymor (“The Lion King”), were still expected to begin in February."

(49) TRUMBO With a résumé including the screenplays for ''Kitty Foyle'' and ''Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo'' and the antiwar novel ''Johnny Got His Gun,'' Dalton Trumbo, above, was one of Hollywood's highest-paid writers. And then, in 1947, he refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee, becoming part of the group known as the Hollywood 10. He was convicted of contempt, sentenced to 11 months in a federal prison and barred from practicing his craft. Writing 30 scripts under pseudonyms, and winning an Oscar (as Robert Rich) in 1956 for ''The Brave One,'' he failed to receive public acknowledgment for his contributions until Otto Preminger credited him on ''Exodus'' in 1960, and Kirk Douglas followed suit on ''Spartacus.'' In 1993 Mr. Trumbo's widow was presented with a posthumous Oscar under his real name for the 1953 film ''Roman Holiday.'' This ''American Masters'' presentation is adapted from Christopher Trumbo's 2003 play based on letters his father wrote during the disintegration of his career. They are read here by Joan Allen, Brian Dennehy, Michael Douglas, Paul Giamatti, Nathan Lane, Josh Lucas, Liam Neeson, David Strathairn and Donald Sutherland. 7 A.M.

In July, a federal district judge indefinitely enjoined the publication of “60 Years Later,” which Mr. Colting wrote under the pen name J. D. California, and has promoted as a sequel to the J. D. Salinger novel “The Catcher in the Rye.” On Thursday, The Associated Press reported, Judge Calabresi called Mr. Colting’s book a “rather dismal piece of work.” But two judges on the panel questioned if the federal district court had heard enough evidence before issuing its injunction.

2009-09-03T10:58:32Z,"Only weeks ago, it seemed that the New Zealand soprano Kiri Te Kanawa was preparing for her exit from the operatic stage: in August, she was quoted by The Daily Telegraph as saying that a production of Strauss’s “Rosenkavalier” at the Cologne Opera in April 2010 would “be my last. It’s not as if I want to do it on a regular basis now, because it’s exhausting.” This was interpreted to mean that she was winding down her opera career, though she would continue to perform concerts. But on Thursday, Ms. Te Kanawa told ABC News in Australia that she had no plans to retire following a set of concerts this week at the Sydney Opera House. “I haven’t got any plans to die either,” she said, according to the ABC report. “I mean, that could be on the cards too before I retire.” She is scheduled to sing the role of the Duchess of Krakenthorpa in Donizetti’s “Fille du Regiment” at the Metropolitan Opera in February, and said it was possible she would sing more opera roles after her appearance at Cologne."

The filmmaker Nick Cassavetes has filed suit against the studio New Line Cinema, saying that he was removed as the director of a planned film about the conservationist Daphne Sheldrick after rewriting its script for free, The Hollywood Reporter said. In his lawsuit, Mr. Cassavetes (whose films include “The Notebook” and “My Sister’s Keeper”) said that he delivered a complete rewrite of a script for “Peaceable Kingdom,” a biographical film about Ms. Sheldrick and her efforts to protect elephants in Kenya, a project he undertook for no pay because he believed he was promised the job as the film’s director. After delivering a script that he was told the studio liked, Mr. Cassavetes said he was taken off the film. He is seeking damages for his writing and directing fees, as well as jobs he missed while working on “Peaceable Kingdom.” New Line Cinema did not comment on the lawsuit."
2009-09-03T11:53:00Z,"A video game controversy that began with an uproar in 2005 ended quietly this week as the parent company of the makers of the Grand Theft Auto series said it paid $20.1 million to settle a class-action lawsuit involving claims that a version of the game included hidden sex scenes, Bloomberg News reported. In a statement, Take-Two Interactive, whose Rockstar Games division produces the best-selling Grand Theft Auto games, said that the settlement was paid to plaintiffs who said they were defrauded when they purchased Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas without knowing it contained explicit content. That game was released in 2004, and the sex scenes, which were not readily accessible in it, were later found by players using a homemade computer program called Hot Coffee. The revelation prompted an outcry from lawmakers, and major retailers like Wal-Mart and Target said they would not stock the game until the sex scenes were completely removed. The class action suit was filed in 2005 in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Take-Two said the settlement also resolves claims by investors that the company improperly backdated stock options, according to Bloomberg."

The Hollywood Reporter said that NBC has ordered a pilot episode of a new “Prime Suspect” series intended for audiences in the United States, to be written by Hank Steinberg, the creator of the CBS crime series “Without a Trace.” The original “Prime Suspect,” which was created by Lynda La Plante and first shown in Britain on the ITV network in 1991, starred Ms. Mirren (“The Queen”) as Jane Tennison, a detective chief inspector contending with her first substantial murder investigation as well as the sexist attitudes of her mostly male coworkers. Seven “Prime Suspect” series were produced through 2006, and broadcasts on PBS help introduce American viewers to Tom Wilkinson and Ralph Fiennes.

A Twitter feed for joelfightsback.com, a Web site run by Mr. Tenenbaum’s legal team, posted a link to the Swedish file-sharing service The Pirate Bay. That site, whose founders were convicted in April by a Swedish court of aiding in copyright violations, posted a playlist called “The $675,000 Mixtape,” which linked to the songs that Mr. Tenenbaum admitted to downloading illegally, and featured a photograph of Mr. Tenenbaum with his arms crossed.

I recently posted about Mark McNairy's cool collection of retooled - rebooted? - Bass Weejuns. And Red Wing, in collaboration with J. Crew, is having a heck of a resurgence, driven by a couple of restyled classics. Now there's news that Derek Galkin, the talented shoe designer behind the lost brand Medium, has reintroduced Seavees, a casual 1960s shoe line from the West Coast. Working with Sperry Topsider, Galkin gradually tweaked the label's iconic shoes with interesting color combinations and materials. Its classic deck shoe will make its debut next spring in rip stop nylon, or colored suede with a brick red sole. Meanwhile, the leather heads at Billy Kirk have teamed up with Sebago to reinterpret a work shoe and boot taken from their Docksides collection. Finally, Cole Haan is reproducing, line for line, its vintage saddle shoes and camp mocs, circa 1985.

Perhaps most notably the volume includes earlier versions of all 17 stories published in “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,” the 1981 collection that cemented Carver’s reputation as a master of the minimalist short story. The stories had been radically edited and cut by Gordon Lish, then Carver’s editor at Alfred A. Knopf. At the time Carver tried to halt publication of the book, but Knopf went ahead. William L. Stull, an English professor at the University of Hartford, and Maureen P. Carroll, an adjunct professor of humanities at the university, reconstructed the Carver stories from Mr. Lish’s papers. Mr. Stull and Ms. Carroll also edited the Library of America collection."

2009-09-03T00:00:00Z,"Many people around the country say they fear government involvement in health care. But a new analysis of Gallup Poll data has found little difference in the way Americans on private health insurance plans rate their care, compared with people insured through the government Medicaid or Medicare programs. In either case, at least 7 in 10 Americans rated their insurance plan's coverage positively. And more than 8 in 10 usually give positive ratings to their plan's quality. Those figures remained consistent over the six years from 2003 through 2008."

2009-09-04T13:18:46Z,"Though the writer and director Tyler Perry is best known for working with his own material — the titles of his seven feature films to date have all started with his name — he has agreed to make his first movie adaptation: Mr. Perry will write, direct and produce a film version of “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf,” the Ntozake Shange play, The Hollywood Reporter said. The play is presented as a series of poems about subjects like love, sex, abortion and rape, delivered by a seven-woman ensemble. It was first performed in California in 1975, then brought to New York’s New Federal Theater and later to the Public Theater and Broadway’s Booth Theater in a version produced by Joseph Papp. A 1982 television version produced for “American Playhouse” featured Alfre Woodard, Lynn Whitfield and Patti LaBelle, as well as Trazana Beverley, a Tony Award winner from the Broadway production. No casting for Mr. Perry’s film, which Lionsgate plans for a 2010 release, has yet been announced."
2009-09-04T12:37:28Z,"Updated | 2:39 p.m. Say what you will about the Beatles, but we think this up-and-coming British pop outfit is going to hit it very, very big. Variety reported that the coming boxed set which compiles the monaural mixes of the Fab Four’s original albums, part of an octopus’s garden’s worth of new Beatles products that will be released on Wednesday, has proved so popular that EMI will produce more copies of the collection. The 13-CD, $299 box set, called “The Beatles in Mono,” was supposed to be limited to 10,000 copies, but quickly sold out at many online stores. (Unlike the coming stereo remasters of the Beatles albums, which will be sold individually, the mono versions will be available only in the box set.) A spokeswoman for EMI told Variety that retailers that sold out of their initial allotment of “The Beatles in Mono” would be sent more, but did not say how many additional copies of the boxed set would be made.An article by Allan Kozinn about the newly remastered Beatles catalog can be found here."

2009-09-04T15:30:13Z,"The Minneapolis Institute of Arts has a new piece of merchandise to offer at its gift shop — not to mention an endearing anecdote that inspired it — following a young art fan’s recent visit to the museum, The Star Tribune reported. On a recent survey of the museum’s Gallery 308, Tim Piowtrowski, a guard there, noticed a little girl who was admiring a 17th-century portrait of the French aristocrat Catherine Coustard, the Marquise of Castelnau, with her son, Léonor, by the French painter Nicolas de Largillière. The young aficionado, whose age was not given, was so taken by the deep blue velvet dress worn by the Marquise in the painting that Mr. Piowtrowski had to admonish her: “Please don’t lick the art,” he said. That phrase now adorns a T-shirt on sale at the museum for $22.50. The painting was unharmed, according to The Star Tribune."

But wait: the small Ernest Pignon-Ernest exhibition, which opened Friday at the Galerie Lelong in Paris and runs through Oct. 10, is not your average street art."

In a statement, Take-Two Interactive, whose Rockstar Games division produces the game, said that among the plaintiffs to be paid were those who said they were defrauded when they bought Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas without knowing that it contained explicit content. That game was released in 2004, and the sex scenes, which were not readily accessible in it, were later found by players using Hot Coffee, a homemade computer program. The revelation prompted an outcry from lawmakers, and major retailers said they would not stock the game until the sex scenes were removed. The class-action suit was filed in 2005 in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Take-Two said the settlement also resolved claims by investors that the company improperly backdated stock options, according to Bloomberg."

A Twitter feed for the site, joelfightsback.com, posted a link to the Swedish file-sharing service the Pirate Bay. That site, whose founders were convicted in April by a Swedish court of aiding in copyright violations, posted “The $675,000 Mixtape,” a playlist that linked to the songs that Mr. Tenenbaum admitted to downloading illegally and featured a photograph of him with his arms crossed. The Recording Industry Association of America has filed for an injunction that would order Mr. Tenenbaum to destroy his illegal files and stop promoting piracy. Mr. Tenenbaum said that he had nothing to do with the song list on the Pirate Bay and that he planned to appeal his verdict and fine."

This was interpreted to mean that she was winding down her opera career though she would continue to perform concerts. But on Thursday, Ms. Te Kanawa, above right, told ABC News in Australia that she had no plans to retire after a set of concerts this week at the Sydney Opera House. “I haven’t got any plans to die either,” she said, according to the ABC report. “I mean, that could be on the cards too before I retire.”."

In July, a federal district judge indefinitely enjoined publication of “60 Years Later,” which Mr. Colting wrote under the pen name J. D. California and has promoted as a sequel to the J. D. Salinger novel “The Catcher in the Rye.” On Thursday, The Associated Press reported, Judge Calabresi called Mr. Colting’s book a “rather dismal piece of work.” But two judges on the panel questioned if the federal district court had heard enough evidence before issuing its injunction. The court did not immediately rule."

(TCM) PRIME TIME FEATURE: GEORGE PAL PRODUCTIONS George Pal was working on ''When Worlds Collide'' (1951) at Paramount Pictures when, in the studio's story library, he came across several unproduced scripts based on the H. G. Wells novel ''The War of the Worlds.'' But even Cecil B. DeMille hadn't been able to get the film made. In 1952 Mr. Pal hired Barré Lyndon to update Wells's Victorian tale. This three-film tribute to Mr. Pal begins with his 1953 version of ''The War of the Worlds,'' set in a California town not far from Los Angeles and featuring Martian war machines with cobralike control arms designed by Albert Nozaki and created by Gordon Jennings. (Gene Barry, above left, and Ned Glass are among the cast members.) Next, at 9:30, is ''The Time Machine'' (1960), based on another Wells novel and starring Rod Taylor as an Edwardian scientist who creates a machine that carries him to the year 802701. The tribute closes at 11:30 with ''Houdini'' (1953), starring Tony Curtis as the magician and escape artist and his new real-life bride, Janet Leigh, as his future bride. 7 A.M.

As expected, Fox said it had signed a multiyear deal with Don Imus, right, the host who was fired by CBS Radio and MSNBC two years ago after making racial remarks about the Rutgers University women's basketball team. His program was revived by the radio company Citadel and the rural television network RFD-TV, but Mr. Imus ended the television deal last month. The simulcast, to be shown from 6 to 9 a.m. Eastern time, is expected to buoy the low-rated Fox Business Network, which began in October 2007. Mr. Imus doesn't make financial news a regular part of his talk show, but Fox said the program ''will incorporate additional business news into its format.'' Notably, three of the anchors partially displaced by Mr. Imus's hiring will host a three-hour morning-news program on the network's Web site, FoxBusiness.com, from 6 to 9. The anchors of the Web show, Jenna Lee, Connell McShane and Ashley Webster, will also appear regularly on ''Imus in the Morning,'' Fox said. Alexis Glick, a vice president at Fox Business who now leads the network's 7 to 10 a.m. hours, will remain the host of the 9 a.m. hour. In a statement, Mr. Imus said: ''I love Fox.

She was 59 years old. Dr. Young was an internationally renowned biological psychiatrist and neuroendocrinologist who conducted seminal work on stress biology and its role in depression and other mood disorders. She was raised in the Detroit and Chicago areas and completed her medical degree from The Ohio State University in 1976. She completed her residency in Psychiatry at the same institution in 1979. She received postdoctoral training at the University of Michigan Medical School in the Department of Psychiatry and the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute. She was then recruited to the faculty of the Institute and the Department where she remained until her death. Dr. Young was the quintessential ""translational"" physician-scientist, who understood the biology of stress and used that knowledge to enhance our understanding of the causes of mood disorders. A particular focus of her research was to uncover the biological and psychosocial reasons for the increased vulnerability of women to depression and anxiety. Dr. Young was also a loving wife and stepmother, a caring physician, a wonderful collaborator and mentor, an ardent gardener and appreciator of the best that life has to offer, and a devoted friend. She is survived by her husband Dr. Peter Hinman, her stepdaughter Dr. Mira Hinman and two step-granddaughters Annika and Celia McDermott-Hinman.

Cartrain, who has previously appropriated images of Mr. Hirst’s famous diamond-encrusted skull, “For the Love of God,” for his own collages, admitted that on July 4 he took the pencils from the installation, called “Pharmacy,” which closed in August. After his arrest, Cartrain said he was told by officers that the pencils alone were worth more than $800,000. In a statement, the Tate Britain confirmed to The Independent that a box of pencils had been taken from the installation and that the theft was being investigated by the police."
2009-09-05T00:00:00Z,"Though the writer and director Tyler Perry is best known for working with his own material — the titles of his seven feature films to date have all started with his name — he has agreed to make his first movie adaptation: Mr. Perry, right, will write, direct and produce a film version of Ntozake Shange’s play “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf,” The Hollywood Reporter said. The play is presented as a series of poems about subjects like love, sex, abortion and rape, delivered by a seven-woman ensemble. It was first performed in California in 1975, then brought to the New Federal Theater in New York and later to the Public Theater and the Booth Theater on Broadway, in a version produced by Joseph Papp. A 1982 television version produced for “American Playhouse” featured Alfre Woodard, Lynn Whitfield and Patti LaBelle. No casting for Mr. Perry’s film, which Lionsgate plans for a 2010 release, has been announced."

Variety reported that the coming boxed set compiling the monaural mixes of the Fab Four’s original albums, part of an octopus’s garden’s worth of new Beatles products to be released on Wednesday, had already proved so popular that EMI will produce more copies of the collection. The 13-CD, $299 set, “The Beatles in Mono,” was supposed to be limited to 10,000 copies, but quickly sold out at many online stores. (Unlike the coming stereo remasters of the Beatles albums, which will be sold individually, the mono versions will be available only in the boxed set.) A spokeswoman for EMI told Variety that retailers that sold out of their initial allotment of “The Beatles in Mono” would be sent more, but did not say how many additional copies would be made."
