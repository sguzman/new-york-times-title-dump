Just last week, we won a National Magazine Award for a photo essay by Ashley Gilbertson on the bedrooms of dead U.S. soldiers. But as rewarding as the big events like that are, it’s the week-to-week excellence of our photo director, Kathy Ryan, and her staff that impresses me even more. They don’t pursue a particular style or idea about pictures. Their interests are gloriously catholic. They pull stuff out of archives. They come up with stunning ideas that enliven subjects that have been photographed a million times before. They scour the earth for new talent. And they are always receptive to ideas that photographers bring to them, a more important skill than you might think."

At one point in the eerily staged production of “Sleep No More” at a mock hotel in Chelsea, a showily pregnant Lady Macduff hikes up her blue velvet evening dress, hops on to a bar and laps milk from a saucer. At another moment in this crazily meandering interpretation of “Macbeth” by Punchdrunk, the British experimental theater company, her dress is laid out on a bed, leaving masked spectators free to pore over its capacious folds and seams."
2011-05-20T17:05:22Z,"“There’s no such thing as L.A.,” says the curator Benjamin Godsill. “There’s multiple, sometimes overlapping bits of community, ideologies and neighborhoods.” Organizing a group show around the theme of a major metropolis poses risks. Hyperbole, dime store anthropology and overlooked artists often crowd the presentation. But the best of these endeavors don’t seek to galvanize a scene, per se, but provide the most basic of contexts: place. In this way, the mercurial nature of Los Angeles provides a valid starting point for an investigation of its artists. This summer, two separate curatorial teams (both based in New York, funnily enough) will tackle the behemoth subject of art in Los Angeles with group shows staged far from home. “Greater LA,” on view until June 10 in SoHo, looks at the city’s contemporary artists, whereas “Venice in Venice,” which opens on June 4 at the Venice Biennial, revisits the city’s rebel artists from the 1960s and ’70s."

The two New York-based artists, who recently began exhibiting collaborative work under the name Jules Marquis, share a Greenpoint studio but regularly shuttle to southeast Virginia, where they’ve created a nonprofit art space on a corner of the Turner family farm. Named Jericho Ditch, after a local logging canal, it serves as a venue and creative getaway for fellow artists. It also embodies the Jules Marquis ethos: from the outside, it’s a shed in a field; inside, it’s a big-city-gallery-style white box lighted by symmetrical fluorescent tubes. Snapp and Turner have two shows opening in June: at Jericho Ditch and at Martos Gallery in New York."

2011-05-20T15:12:18Z,"Everyone has some fascination with the combination of sex, money and power, but who would have thought they would all point to a career at the International Monetary Fund? Founded in 1945 at the Bretton Woods Conference with a mandate to prevent wild swings in national currency values, the fund, I would have imagined, would set itself against swinging of every kind.  That is clearly not the case. According to Alan Beattie’s interview this morning with I.M.F. semi-renegade Simon Johnson, the fund was firstly aimed at helping struggling postwar economies in Western Europe, and its first loan (in 1947) was to France.  For 35 of the fund’s 64 years, its managing director was French. When Western Europe had recovered, the fund went on to other things and secured for itself, let’s say, a mixed reputation.  From the 1960s onward, and culminating in the period of strict I.M.F. loan “conditionality” and rigid programs of “structural adjustment,” the fund earned a reputation as a corps of technocratic drones pitilessly contented in their air-conditioned hotel rooms as they imposed cookie-cutter “solutions” on prostrate governments. You would read from time to time of “anti-I.M.F. riots” in one poor capital or another, and you could guess what it meant, and it wasn’t pretty.    By the early part of our own century, the fund was entering a period of repentance, not least because some poorer countries were now “emerging markets” and making a big point of repaying I.M.F. loans and swearing never to take them again. Escaping the I.M.F. became a symbol of freedom. But if the fund wasn’t making loans it had no income, and we know what that means: time for reform! Emerging-market players, with a sympathetic United States, pushed for changes in voting power. In essence, the developing world would get more I.M.F. power at the expense (slightly) of the United States and (mainly) of Europe. Several reforms, first undertaken in 2006 and most recently last year, would take the voting share of “advanced economies” from 60.6 to 55.3, and of “emerging market and developing countries” from 39.4 to 44.7."

Mr. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers said in court that their client would put up $1 million cash bail and wear an ankle monitor.

So that’s why I wrote this 2011 religion quiz as my Sunday column."

But the most meaningful act of all may be the Cannes Film Festival’s decision — announced just days before screenings got under way — to show new films that Mr. Panahi and his countryman Mohammed Rasoulof had made in defiance of their bans.

2011-05-21T08:26:29Z,"The episode up for discussion is called “Swerve,” alluding both to Julie’s self-imposed car accident and various other instances of changes of heart and turns of fortune. Unable to muster the stamina to return to college after her run-in with Derek’s wife last, week Julie decides that the way to bide more time at home is to ram her car into a mailbox near her parents’ house. Maybe I’d be a really weak and bad parent to a teenager, but I don’t think I would have tried to force Julie to go back to Burleson, which is after all, a fictitious college and one at a significant psychic remove from her dreams of a Northeastern educational experience. Coach Taylor being Coach Taylor, he wanted Julie to man up and face the mess. The whole point of the affair now seems to have been to stack the deck so in favor of Julie’s return home that the show could easily situate her back in Dillon. Perhaps it was too implausible that Julie would just go to Dillon Tech in the first place, so the writers dispatched her to a place where she implausibly made no friends and experienced not a second’s worth of intellectual fulfillment or genuine freshman pleasure.It was interesting to see Coach having the correct perception of Julie’s motives rather than Tami. It is coach who realizes that Julie must have crashed on purpose. Tami is a disbeliever. It was interesting to see the show cast Coach’s impotence — he can’t get Julie in the car and back to school because she refuses with every fiber of her being to go — against Vince’s father’s assertion of paternal authority. Vince is in trouble with his thug lender, and his father steps in and solves problems by beating the daylights out of the guy, hoping to make sure the guy never gets within a yard of Vince again. Will this work? It sure felt as if it would. I’d hate to see this come back to haunt Vince’s father, or worse, for Vince to take the moral high ground against his dad in response."

Born in Baltimore, MD, to the late Henry A. and Isabelle (Dicke) Ackermann, he was the youngest of nine children and was predeceased by all of his siblings. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, after which he had a distinguished professional career as a chemist and computer scientist.

As a committed Roman Catholic, Harry was a daily communicant at St. Robert Bellarmine Church, Freehold and participated in numerous ministries in the various parishes that he was a member of throughout his life.

2011-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Apparently not content for musicals like ''Evita,'' ''Phantom of the Opera'' and ''Starlight Express'' to be his only gifts to posterity, Andrew Lloyd Webber has decided to make a more easily quantifiable contribution to British culture: he has said he will donate 32 million - nearly $52 million - to arts organizations in his home country, BBC News reported. The announcement comes at a time when the British government has drastically reduced its financial support of cultural institutions as part of a nationwide austerity program. The funds pledged by Mr. Lloyd Webber were raised from the sale last year of a Picasso painting owned by the composer, ''Portrait of Angel Fernandez de Soto (The Absinthe Drinker),'' which fetched about $51.8 million with commission at a Christie's auction. (Don't cry for Mr. Lloyd Webber even though Christie's had estimated the painting would sell for up to to $60 million.)"

Corey Taylor, the lead singer of the heavy-metal band Slipknot, will be among the speakers to address the Oxford Union in the coming weeks, according to the schedule published on the union's Web site. A listing for the event, scheduled for June 8, notes that Mr. Taylor joined Slipknot ''afer being approached by the original band members whilst working in a sex shop in Des Moines,'' adding that though his ''commitment to the rock and roll lifestyle saw him develop an alcohol problem, overdose on cocaine and attempt to commit suicide,'' nonetheless ''he has been clean since 2006.'' In an interview with the Kansas radio station The Rock (98.9 FM) reported by NME.com, Mr. Taylor said his invitation to Oxford was ''very ironic seeing as I didn't graduate from high school.'' In addition to using his appearance to promote his new memoir ''Seven Deadly Sins,'' Mr. Taylor said, ''I'm probably going to swear and sweat a lot.''"

2011-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Most everyone has had the experience of searching carefully for the best airfare and booking a flight, only to see the ticket price later drop. (With fuel prices rising, that might not be happening as often, but it still occurs.) Airlines typically offer credits or vouchers for the difference in price when that happens, although most of them mute the benefit by imposing a hefty change fee when you try to claim the credit. But a lot of consumers don't realize they may be eligible for a credit, or don't act fast enough to claim it. The flier first has to know the fare has dropped, and then must call the airline in time to request the credit before the price goes up again. For that reason, a lot of travelers don't take advantage of the credit. A recent survey by MasterCard found that 71 percent of people searching for airfares weren't aware of the availability of such credits and that 10 percent knew they existed but didn't know how to take advantage of them."

2011-05-21T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (HBO) GET HIM TO THE GREEK (2010) Russell Brand (above right, with Jonah Hill) reprises Aldous Snow, his snake-hipped British rocker from ''Forgetting Sarah Marshall,'' in Nicholas Stoller's comedy about a record-label drone (Mr. Hill) dispatched to transport Snow -- a wreck after the failure of his latest album -- from London to the Greek, a famous concert hall in Los Angeles. Need we add that mayhem ensues? As played by ''the brilliantly unpredictable'' Mr. Brand, Snow ''is more than a pop-culture museum piece or a MacGruber-like bit of sketch comedy nonsense,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''He has feelings, ideas and a dollop of talent to go with the uncontrolled appetites; even though he's narcissistic and self-destructive, he is also kind of fun to hang around with.'' As Aaron Green, ''Mr. Hill, wide-eyed and anxious as ever, makes a fine visual and temperamental foil for Mr. Brand,'' Mr. Scott said. ''The two of them are like the Trylon and Perisphere of comedy.'' The result, he said, is ''the bawdy-sweet mixture that is the signature of the Judd Apatow school of screen comedy.''

Mr. Scott added: ''It is basically a ribald road picture, with not much of a plot beyond Aaron and Aldous's journey from London to Los Angeles via New York and Las Vegas, and not much for women to do that allows them to be funny in their own right.

''More than forty years later, I figure it's finally time to write about this crazy journey that's taken me around the world and back.'' The book will be released in spring 2012."

2011-05-22T00:00:00Z,"Surf culture has long produced its own aesthetic, along with a tradition of surfer-artists. On the visual vanguard at the moment are Alex Kopps and Tin Ojeda.

''The content and events that have influenced my artwork were not discovered at the beach,'' says Kopps, who lives in the Bay Area and sells some of his T-shirts and posters (right) at Mollusk Surf Shop. His film ''Displacement,'' about ''displacement hull'' surfboards, uses 1970s Super-8 footage with abstract effects. Ojeda, the Argentinian-born painter and surfer behind the Drug Money Art clothing line (drugmoneyart.com), is bringing the beach to the city.

A man in a crisp checked shirt gets up and starts to dance, bouncing out a complicated bumbumBAM bumbumBAM with his feet, moving as smoothly as a Martha Graham dancer, hitting the floor on the downbeat. It is Thursday night in Fries (pronounced freeze), Va., population 600, on the wide New River. In the century-old Fries Theater, the silk wallpaper, once a glorious aquamarine embossed with gold ferns, is faded. A sign promises movies for 10 cents, 25 cents on weekends, but there hasn't been a film here in years. The Fries high school closed in 1989 after the cotton mill that gave birth to this hamlet in 1902 shut down. But where the economy has faltered, the local music culture is thriving. Take a drive through the dozens of one-stoplight towns that are planted along highways that twist through this region's blue hills and green valleys, and you'll find that music is the manna of the community."

2011-05-22T00:00:00Z,"Tampa Bay's James Shields entered the weekend tied for the major league lead in pickoffs with five, which is unusual for a right-handed pitcher. Even though he does not face the runner at first base, a few things work in his favor. Shields has quick feet, he said, and he also studies the layout of each infield. During batting practice on the road, Shields will measure the distance from first base to the outer edge of the dirt cutout. That way, when he peeks at the runner, Shields can accurately measure his lead based on how close he is to the cutout."

And who's going to see it under the cuff of his tux, anyway? That's why I don't look at this kind of e-mail until I absolutely have to. They make me crazy. You, too? I know. Looking at some of the pictures from Cannes, I can't tell if I'm watching a rerun of ''Gunsmoke'' or ''The Love Boat.'' I do know that if the jury were to give a Miss Kitty award for the worst dawggone dress, it ought to go to Penélope Cruz, in a lavender, corseted Marchesa. There are just too many people on the poop deck of the ''Love Boat'' to name."
2011-05-22T00:00:00Z,"It's rush hour in St. Bart's, and the model Daria Werbowy has stopped traffic. The photographer Cass Bird has decided to shoot the Canadian stunner on top of a hill that overlooks the island's airport runway. Werbowy agrees, slips into a Missoni bathing suit and runs across the highway. Although it's off-season in St. Bart's, a line of cars has paused to watch this long, beautiful creature skip across the road. Within five minutes, the bathing suit is off and Werbowy is naked with nothing to cover her but a street sign. ''She's like a wolverine,'' Bird says. Though Werbowy, 28, is one of the most sought-after models in the world - she stars in campaigns for Celine, Balmain and Salvatore Ferragamo, and is a face of Lancome - she seems to be most comfortable in next to nothing. At the shoot, she greets the team in her typical tomboy getup: jean shorts covered in patches she sewed on herself, an old Nirvana T-shirt, lots of silver rings and an enviable tan. Werbowy loves the sea as much as the sun - a few years ago she took a break from modeling and sailed across the Atlantic from New York for 24 days with her father, brother and sister. A few days after our shoot, she would be embarking on a two-month sailing expedition from Guatemala to Belize, island hopping along the coast, then traveling through Central America to Costa Rica. There would be no staff, no captain, no chef, just a few friends and family members. Werbowy would do it all: sail, steer, clean and cook. ''Daria can morph into so many different things,'' Bird says. ''She's tough as nails.''"

But we are not told the act nor the circumstances surrounding the conviction, except that his crime involved an adult woman and that it occurred two decades ago.

Some states require men to register if they are caught visiting prostitutes, urinating in public, streaking and, until 2003, engaging in sodomy. Lumping these crimes with pedophilia and aggravated rape has ruined the lives of many people who made the mistake not of committing a terrible act but of being caught in behavior that harms no one.

Rinse (in the on-beach showers) and repeat (on Sunday). But if you want to eat actual meals, drink the local grog (ice-cold beer), listen to music and get around town, too, you're asking for trouble. The Brazilian real is at its strongest this century - the weekend I was there $1 got you 1.57 reais - and by one consulting group's measure life for expatriates in Rio is more expensive than anywhere else in the Western Hemisphere, except Sao Paulo and New York.

For everyone else, the view of that mysterious Scottish castle known as the Bannerman's Island Arsenal had grown more disheartening over the years. Into the late 1960s, the fantastic confection was still pretty much whole, until fire gutted it in 1969. Just a few years ago, the ornate shell of the tower keep was largely intact, encrusted with turrets, crenels, merlons, oriels, corbels, loopholes and bosses that looked like cannon balls. Whatever providential force held the walls precariously upright expired in the winter of 2009-10, when much of the tower crumbled."

2011-05-22T00:00:00Z,"ROSENKRANZ--Gerardo Miguel, Greenwich resident, passed away peacefully on May 11, 2011 surrounded by his loving family. Jerry was a beloved father of Lili, Tommy and Emma and loving husband of Lauren. Jerry is the son of George and Edith Rosenkranz and brother to Roberto and Ricardo. Jerry was the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Ventech International, a private venture capital firm concentrating on early stage communications, information technology and internet companies. Prior to Ventech, Jerry was a senior executive in business development, marketing and sales worldwide for Sprint International. He established Sprint's European headquarters. Jerry was born and raised in Mexico City and graduated from Stanford University in 1973 with a BS and MS in Electrical Engineering. He received a graduate degree of ENGR in Electrical Engineering Administration and wrote his dissertation on Management Information in Multinational Organizations. At the young age of 12 Jerry's interest in electronics became apparent when he built the first color TV from a kit for the family. His curiosity for electronics and technology was the guiding light for his career. He was at the forefront of technology with a deep understanding of Latin America and was recognized as one of the important forces to bring technology entrepreneurship to Latin America. Over the course of his career, he contributed to the formation and growth of many leading businesses including Blade Logic, Mercado Libre, Patagon and Bling. Jerry expressed his passion for life through his many pursuits, which he started enjoying as one of three brothers growing up in Mexico. These interests included skiing, golf, scuba diving, photography and wind surfing. He loved to travel and was fluent in four languages including Italian, French, Spanish and English. His education and career took him many places, yet these interests were a foundation for sharing life with his family and close friends. Jerry was extremely philanthropic and was involved in many organizations including the Mouse Foundation, Stanford University, Greenwich Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, DonorsChoose.org, as well as Brunswick and Greenwich Academy where his children attend school, just to name a few. Jerry will be remembered as a loving, warm, and genuinely compassionate father, friend and mentor. Throughout his life, and especially over the course of the last eight years as he confronted the challenges of cancer, he was a fountain of courage and grace for all who were fortunate enough to cross his path. His bright light will be missed. In lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests that you consider a gift to the Rosenkranz Neuroendocrine Research Fund at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

Pean says she furthered her commitment to eco-minded jewelry during her CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund mentorship at Tiffany & Company; she and the company's C.E.O., Michael Kowalski, share what he calls ''an approach to precious materials that is sustainable and benefits the communities involved.'' The quest led Pean to the Ahe atoll in French Polynesia, where the Kamoka Pearl Farm uses fish and sponges to clean its oyster shells. The farm harvests without chemicals, feeds its employees (''Raw oysters, fried oysters, oyster risotto, a lot of oysters!'' Pean says) and turns the shells into beads. Pean's line uses Kamoka's keshi pearls in hues of blue, aubergine and gold for pieces like a ring set with delicate pave-diamond tendrils (conflict-free, of course), which Pean says was inspired by Ahe's ''pollution-free midnight sky reflecting against the waves and the light.''

In Tangier, you are only as grand as your rooftop terrace.

Rinse (in the on-beach showers) and repeat (on Sunday). But if you want to eat actual meals, drink the local grog (ice-cold beer), listen to music and get around town, too, you're asking for trouble. The Brazilian real is at its strongest this century - the weekend I was there $1 got you 1.57 reais - and by one consulting group's measure life for expatriates in Rio is more expensive than anywhere else in the Western Hemisphere, except Sao Paulo and New York. Tourists will feel that pain as well, especially when it comes to restaurant meals, taxis and entrance costs to attractions."

2011-05-22T00:00:00Z,"Turning a historic house - whether designed for laborers or lords - into a hotel is never easy. When Fred Krehbiel, a Chicago industrialist, decided to buy Ballyfin, a Georgian manor on 600 acres in Ireland's County Laois, the property was being used as a school, he says, ''and we had to give them six years to build a new building.'' During that time, Krehbiel's team of more than 100 workers began transforming the 1812 mansion into a hotel with 15 rooms, all while working around 500 teenagers. Krehbiel and crew restored ornate plasterwork, bought back some of the previous owner's paintings, rebuilt the conservatory (which had to be disassembled and shipped to England for repairs) and even uncovered a Roman sarcophagus bathtub, now installed in one of the guest rooms. (Appropriately, a family motto of Ballyfin's original owner, Sir Charles Coote, was ''coute que coute'' - ''cost what it may.'') In Montenegro, meanwhile, the Australian interior designer Marylou Thompson of the firm Denniston had an equally complicated task: turning Sveti Stefan, a village on an island in the Adriatic Sea, into an Aman resort. Not only couldn't the exterior of the buildings - some of which date to the 14th century - be altered, but Aman had to promise Montenegrins access, during festivals, to the island's ancient churches. Everything had to be done ''without making large holes in the walls,'' says Thompson, who encountered more damage to the buildings from a 1979 earthquake than anyone had expected. Most lights are lanterns, for example, hung from wall hooks, rather than ceiling fixtures requiring hidden wiring."

2011-05-22T00:00:00Z,"The laid-back Basque town of Biarritz has been Europe's surf capital since the 1950s. Yet despite the crowds and the casinos, it has retained its scruffy coolness. The Bay of Biscay provides the town with two main waves: the Plage de la Cote des Basques, a popular and consistent sandbar break; and the Grande Plage, an unpredictable, high-performance beach break up the coast. At least a dozen groups give surfing lessons, among them Jo Moraiz (011-33-6-62-76-17-24; jomoraiz.com), France's first surf school. Biarritz's plushest beach hotel is the Hotel Du Palais (011-33-5-59-41-64-00; hotel-du-palais.com; doubles from about $665), a palace-turned-hotel where Alain Ducasse worked one of his first kitchen jobs. You're less likely to see surfers there than at one of the campgrounds on Biarritz's outskirts. A happy medium between opulence and outdoors is Hotel Le Caritz (011-33-5-59-24-41-84; hotel-lecaritz-biarritz.com; doubles from $210), a handsome inn with a terrace restaurant. For the closest surf proximity, try the basic but comfortable Carlina Lodge (011-33-5-59-24-42-14; carlina.com; doubles from $190), which has direct access to the Cote des Basques. For post-surf refueling, the lovely covered market Les Halles (halles-biarritz.fr) offers outdoor fish and tapas restaurants, palpable reminders of the city's vicinity to Spain. And Le Surfing (011-33-5-59-24-78-72; lesurfingbiarritz.fr), an inviting bar and restaurant where vintage surf memorabilia serves as decor, might be the only brasserie in town that allows sandy feet.

2011-05-22T00:00:00Z,"Well, it was a club,'' says Eleanor Stefani, the longtime owner of the Colony of Wellfleet. ''It was a private club. You had to have your name in the Social Register - literally!'' The 10 Bauhaus-style cottages, which have housed devoted guests for decades, were first known as the Mayo Hill Colony Club. They were built on the bay side of Wellfleet, the little Cape Cod town, in 1949 by Nathaniel Saltonstall, an architect from a prominent Boston family who was a founder of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. Along with his business partner Oliver Morton, he designed it as a midcentury Modern retreat for high-society art collectors, with views of the sparkling bay and grassy fairways of the Chequessett Yacht and Country Club through the pines. At the same time, Wellfleet itself - much quieter than its flashier neighbor to the north, Provincetown - was becoming another sort of club. Edmund Wilson, the literary critic, arrived with his third wife, Mary McCarthy, in the 1940s, and they were followed by what seemed like the entire faculties of Columbia and Harvard, the staffs of Partisan Review and The New Yorker, and half the psychoanalysts on the Upper West Side, who began to descend upon the village every summer, and particularly in August. (McCarthy famously called Wellfleet ''the seacoast of Bohemia'' in her novel ''A Charmed Life,'' and Wilson, in his journal, credited the historian H. Stuart Hughes with the memorable sobriquet ''la plage des intellectuels.'') But as weather-beaten shacks and skinny-dipping in the ponds became the order of the day, the colony continued to maintain certain standards."

It's also nearly impossible to believe how precarious its future seemed 10 years ago this spring, when riots erupted in this part of the city just north of downtown, prompting national headlines. A stream of revitalization efforts by both nonprofit and corporate entities since then is finally yielding a rush of new, independent businesses. ''It's a real village economy,'' said Seth Schott, who founded OTR Matters, a grassroots network that promotes the district's preservation and development, in January.

2011-05-22T00:00:00Z,"ABELE--Manlio G. Research Professor Emeritus, Department of Radiology, NYU School of Medicine died on May 5, 2011. He is survived by his son, Michael, as well as close friends and colleagues who were like family to him. Dr. Abele was born in Turin, Italy, on June 6, 1920. He graduated from Politechnic Institute in Turin, in 1943 with a doctorate in Electrical Engineering. He was appointed a Professor of Electromagnetics, at the National University of Cordoba, Argentina in 1948. In 1955, he joined the Atomic Center, San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina, where he directed a research laboratory and taught Physics in the graduate program. In 1959 he moved to the USA and taught Electrophysics at the Polytechnic Institute, Brooklyn until 1965. From 1965 to 1976, at the General Applied Science Laboratories, Inc., in Westbury, NY, he led a team of researchers in a DARPA-funded study of the effects of the plasma flow fields and plasma wake on electromagnetic fields. He was recruited as a Research Professor to the Department of Radiology at NYU School of Medicine in 1976. His initial research there focused on novel CT reconstruction algorithms. In 1982, he won a landmark decision from the US Court of Patent Appeals that gave rise to the Freeman-Walter-Abele test used to determine if mathematical algorithms were a patentable subject matter. Since the early 1980s his research focused on MR imaging systems based on permanent magnets, the field where he left his important and lasting marks. His novel design methodology is described in his book: Structures of Permanent Magnets. Abele's yokeless magnet design provides a systematic mathematical formulation for prismatic structures that generate uniform fields in arbitrary cavities without the need of an external ferromagnetic yoke. The utility of yokeless design has been experimentally verified on fully operational medical MRIs, and more recently, on the magnetic spectrometer launched aboard the PAMELA satellite, which was launched into orbit in June 2006. The experimental demonstration of the properties of field confinement of Abele's yokeless magnetic structures was first established in the 1990s, at the US Army Electronics Technology and Devices Laboratory, Fort Monmouth, NJ and later at the laboratory of Sumitomo Special Metals, Japan, where a large scale experimental model was built. The research work on medical applications of permanent magnet technology at NYU was done in collaboration with Esaote Biomedica, Genoa, Italy. Esaote developed several types of MRI units based on Abele's designs, including a lightweight Artoscan MRI dedicated for imaging the extremities. During his long and productive life Dr. Abele was awarded over 30 patents and published numerous scientific papers. As a colleague, he was inspiring both as an original thinker and for his high level of dedication. Although a perfectionist, he was always quick to reward a job well done with cookies from his ample supply, kept for many years in an impressively large safe. Dr. Abele was also a gifted artist, who at 19 had to choose between his love of art and science. Although he chose science as a profession, he pursued graphic arts as an avocation throughout his life. Many original sketches of family, friends, and favorite places decorated his home and office. In the company of family and friends, Dr. Abele revealed a wry sense of humor, a generous spirit, a heartfelt compassion for the welfare of others, and the highest degree of personal integrity. He will be long remembered and deeply missed."

2011-05-22T00:00:00Z,"This is an issue devoted to obsessives and ferreters -- who are always, invariably, my favorite people. We begin with Daria Werbowy, our cover girl and one of the fashion world's most sought-after women. When we first approached her with the idea of doing a little sailing for us in St. Bart's, the answer was an enthusiastic ''yes,'' followed by a pensive ''when?'' And that question had little to do with her busy life in fashion. Would her father's boat be in Barcelona or Guatemala? Would her own boat be in Latin America or Canada? In what vast expanse of water was her brother tossing an anchor? Everything was about knots and crafts and routes and captain's logs. It was like trying to book Patrick O'Brian's Jack Aubrey and not the face of Lancôme. Werbowy is a sailor first, model second, and her passion for the sea and ability at the helm is as jaw-dropping as her beauty. Then there are the writers. Consider Jean Hanff Korelitz, the novelist, who enjoys picking minuscule scraps of history out of the banks of the Thames, or Christopher Petkanas, who heeds Tangier's siren call to passionate eccentrics and pleasure seekers. Or Elaine Sciolino, the longtime New York Times foreign correspondent who has lived in France since 2002. Her new book, ''La Seduction,'' excerpted here, is a wonderfully nuanced investigation of how flirtation and provocation function in French society."

The two New York-based artists, who recently began exhibiting collaborative work under the name Jules Marquis, share a Greenpoint studio but regularly shuttle to southeast Virginia, where they've created a nonprofit art space on a corner of the Turner family farm. Named Jericho Ditch, after a local logging canal, it serves as a venue and creative getaway for fellow artists. It also embodies the Jules Marquis ethos: from the outside, it's a shed in a field; inside, it's a big-city-gallery-style white box lighted by symmetrical fluorescent tubes.

This puzzle, known as the Ducci game or 4-number game, is easy to state and understand, uses a procedure a child can carry out, and yet it unlocks the door to fabulous mathematical riches. For those who missed it I would urge you to go back and take a look at it. Here is a brief restatement, given a slightly different visual model from last week. Given any four arbitrary positive integers a, b, c and d, representing the top rung of a ladder, you construct another step below it, consisting of the positive differences between them taken cyclically: |a-b|, |b-c|, |c-d| and |d-a|. An example 2-step ladder is:1 2 5 91 3 4 8It turns out that all such ladders eventually end as all the numbers become zeroes. One challenge was to find what initial numbers gave rise to the longest ladders, and it turned out that the champion quartets had a fascinating mathematical property."

The differences between the Swiss luxury-house’s flats and your run-of-the-mill ballet ones are vast according to the company’s senior corps de ballet dancers, Gretchen Smith and Marika Anderson. The women work in nude leather Bloch dance shoes both in the classroom and throughout rehearsals. And when they’re not dancing they still prefer to slip into flats. “I’m really picky when it comes to flats because I wear them to the bone,” says Anderson, who previously wore Cole Haan because of the Nike-Air instep. “We really like the Bally-Rina’s in blue,” says Smith pointing out the shoe’s ultra low vamp. Smith also likes that the sole of the shoe is comfortable and how the inside looks like an actual pointe shoe. This summer, the company heads for a slew of performances in Saratoga and both women see themselves wearing Bally-Rina flats, Smith with a flowy high-waisted skirt; Anderson with fitted jeans and a T-shirt. They’ll pair them with matching Bally-Rina bags stuffed with the tools of the trade: several pairs of pointe shoes, flat shoes, tape, scissors, glue, needles and thread, water and vitamin B. The cute but functional special Bally-Rina collection comes in shades of navy, grass green and yellow – that should be more than enough to keep more than New York City ballerinas dancing."

While in Edgefield (the birthplace of Senator Strom Thurmond, who died in 2003), 50 Cent confronts a museum docent about the racially charged symbolism of the Confederate flag. She, in turn, informs him that some of the slaves in the area were from Mongolia -- a statement that baffles 50 Cent. ''Black citizens of this country really needs to study the history, because it's just as much the black ancestry as it is the white ancestry,'' she tells him. Later, 50 Cent responds: ''She's offering her truth, what she's accepted as the truth based on information given to her. But I don't agree with it.''

But if some courses are indisputably better than others, then inevitably, some are worse. Quite a bit worse, in my experience. So bad that they're worth a detour - if only because they make you grateful for the other better kind. Worseness is not necessarily a matter of maintenance, or the lack of it. One of the best courses I've ever played is Auchnafree, which was laid out by a shepherd, John Pollock, in a glen in Perthshire, Scotland. The cups were tin cans, and the groundskeeping crew consisted entirely of sheep, who took care of the mowing and the fertilizing. On the other hand, I have played resort courses so lush, so perfectly kept up, that they feel a little soporific and unnatural, with the fairways spooling away as if from rolls of Astroturf."

Mr. Obama, speaking before a conference of the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee, offered familiar assurances that the United States' commitment to Israel's long-term security was ''ironclad.''

Instead, she entered a door that was already open, as a room-service waiter left. The new details were part of a fuller picture of the events in the hotel suite that emerged as the authorities worked out the final details of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's bail package. While it means they will not have the electronic footprint of the housekeeper's card key as evidence, they will presumably have the room-service waiter's testimony -- and the information on the time when he entered if he used his card key -- to set the time of the attack. Paul J. Browne, the New York Police Department's chief spokesman, also offered some other additional details of the encounter on the 28th floor of the Sofitel on 44th Street last Saturday afternoon. He said the housekeeper cleaned the living room and dining room before she entered the bedroom, and that she discovered Mr. Strauss-Kahn there, naked.

2011-05-24T12:21:30Z,"Social media, eco-lodging and a D.I.Y. ethic intersect at HI Matic, a new B&B-hostel hybrid in the hip Paris neighborhood of EsBas (East Bastille). The hotel takes a plugged-in approach to hospitality, eschewing full-service concierge and staff for a digitally customizable experience. Not only can guests tailor nearly every detail of their stay on touch-screens throughout the building, but they can also share information with the room next door – or, if they want, with all 42 rooms at once. The organic breakfast is served through futuristic vending machines, which also offer books, aromatherapy diffusers and other goodies. Each visitor receives a personalized list of exhibitions and shows recommended by local experts, and two electronic music stations – one mellow, one groovier – are available on every floor, courtesy of the German record label Kompakt. Matali Crasset, a Philippe Starck protégée who has opened three other hotels with the HI group (two in Nice and one in Nefta, Tunisia), created Ryokan-inspired rooms with modular furniture and floor mattresses. She chose the area for its authenticity and charm. “There are lots of bars and it’s fun, but the neighborhood is not touristy,” she says. “It has kept its local flavor, with mom-and-pop shops and cafés.” Among her favorite spots is Septime (80 rue de Charonne), a new foodie hotspot directly across the street from the hotel where the star chef Bertrand Grébaut concocts simple but sophisticated dishes that le tout Paris is raving about."

The boys understood what the military was in a very hazy “It must involve a ship, Daddy going away, and a large yellow bee” kind of way. But because their father wasn’t directly in harm’s way, I was able to gloss over hard questions about war and just concentrate on the fun parts of having a dad in the military from a toddler’s perspective — serving the country and wearing really cool hats."

On the 12th, Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit Earth -- one more space triumph for the Soviet Union. Though the flight was not unexpected, it was nonetheless deflating; it would be more than a month before Alan Shepard became the first American in space, and that was on a 15-minute suborbital flight. On the 17th, a force of anti-Castro exiles, trained by the C.I.A., invaded communist Cuba at the Bay of Pigs -- a fiasco within 36 hours.

After spending four years as a fringe part-time player, he hit 54 home runs and was rewarded with a five-year, $65 million contract. But what Bautista, the Toronto Blue Jays' new star slugger, has done so far in 2011 defies comprehension. Entering Monday's game against the Yankees, he was hitting .353 and leading the league in home runs (18) and walks (39), even as the American League over all slumped to its lowest offensive level since 1981. As a result, his on-base and slugging percentages, of .500 and .816, were a combined 165 percent above the league average - a ratio only 3 points shy of the record set by Barry Bonds in 2002."

''Merrily,'' the Stephen Sondheim-George Furth musical that takes a backward-in-time look at the disintegration of a songwriting team's professional and personal relationships, will open the Encores! season on Feb. 8 and run through Feb. 12. The musical, based on George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's play of the same title, played just 16 regular performances in its original Broadway run in 1981 but has gradually gained stature with Sondheim aficionados and musical-theater fans; many directors have since mounted revivals of it, including Michael Grandage and Mr. Lapine, a frequent Sondheim collaborator.

2011-05-24T00:00:00Z,"SMITH--Quentin I.,Jr., died peacefully on May 20, 2011 after a short illness. He was 83 years old and a resident of Kendal-on-Hudson in Sleepy Hollow, NY at the time of his death. Born in New York City, Quentin was the eldest son of Alice Lawson Smith and Quentin Irving Smith. He grew up in Edgemont, NY and graduated from Scarsdale High School, where he met his wife of sixty years, Beverly Pertsch. After a stint in the Army, Quentin graduated in 1950 from Yale University where, among other activities, he played on the varsity baseball team. He also graduated from the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard Business School. Quentin began his business career at the Prudential Insurance Company. In 1957, he joined Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby Inc, later known as Towers Perrin and now part of Towers Watson, a leading international management consulting company. He rose through the ranks at TPF&C and, in 1971, at the age of 44, became the firm's President and Chief Executive Officer, a position he held until his retirement in 1987. During Quentin's tenure, TPF&C grew from a firm with annual revenues of $12 million and a few offices to a business with annual revenues of close to $500 million, thousands of employees and offices around the globe. He helped to engineer a series of strategic acquisitions that diversified the company's service offerings and transformed it into one of the largest, privately-held consulting firms in the world. Quentin's colleagues credited him with transitioning TPF&C from a loose coalition of individual practitioners into a focused, disciplined and integrated worldwide professional services firm, a leader in its field. Quentin was a tireless executive who valued greatly all the people he worked with regardless of position or title. During his career, Quentin also proudly served as a member of the Board of Directors of The Guardian Life Insurance Company, The J. Walter Thompson Company, Omnicom Group, UGI Corporation, and the Employee Benefit Research Institute. In retirement, Quentin lived in Sanibel Island and Boca Grande, FL, as well as East Orleans, MA. He was a fixture at his grandchildren's many sporting events, concerts, and plays. He also performed volunteer work for the United Nations. He continued his lifelong passion for baseball, always watching and rooting for the New York Yankees and personally playing softball well into his seventies in the Cape Cod Old Timers Softball League. He was an avid tennis player and occasional golfer. He was a long time member of the Eastward Ho Golf Club in Chatham, MA and Shenorock Shore Club in Rye, NY. Quentin was a wonderful man and leaves behind many adoring family members. In addition to his wife Beverly, Quentin is survived by two brothers, Peter L. Smith of Richland, Washington and Donald L. Smith of Rock Island, IL, his three children, Jeffrey Q. Smith of Purchase, NY, Lance A. Smith of Westport, CT, and Karen L. (Smith) Salinaro of Hastings on Hudson, NY, their spouses, seven grandchildren, and a host of extended family in Florida and elsewhere. When in the last several years his health deteriorated and his activities became much more limited, his spirit remained strong. Quentin always had a smile and wave for those he saw. He never stopped caring about his family, friends, and former colleagues. He will be greatly missed. Quentin was interred at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, NY following a private family ceremony. A memorial service to celebrate his life will be held in New York City during June. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made in Quentin's name to support either research into the aging brain under the direction of Dr. Richard Mayeux, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, or Yale University, Ray Tompkins Associates, P.O.

Karol Wight, an expert in Roman glass, has spent her entire professional career at the Getty, where she was instrumental in the reopening in 2006 of the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, Calif., where the museum's antiquities collection is housed. Since 2007 Ms. Wight has run the museum's antiquities department, succeeding Marion True, who left the job after being accused by the Italian government of trafficking in looted artifacts. The case against Ms. True, which dragged on for more than five years, ended in October after a court ruled that the statute of limitations on the crimes she was accused of had expired; her legal team had not yet had the chance to call witnesses in her defense. The case put pressure on several American museums with extensive antiquities collections, and the Getty and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, among other institutions, reached agreements with the Italian government to return some disputed artifacts."

At some private colleges, the numbers were even more extreme.” As a template for the future, he points to Amherst College in Massachusetts, which, he said, has bolstered its enrollment of lower-income students by devoting more resources to financial aid and using its transfer program mostly to admit community college students."

2011-05-25T09:00:54Z,"“There’s a renaissance in the shellfish world right now, especially oysters,” says Robert Spaulding, the executive chef at Elliott’s Oyster House in Seattle. Elliott’s considers the oyster to be emblematic of the Pacific Northwest’s thriving farm-to-table — or, in this case, beach-to-bar — dining scene. Elliott’s has an expansive raw bar and many direct relationships with Northwestern oyster growers. As Spaulding puts it, shucking knife in hand and flanked by a seemingly endless battalion of shells on ice, “It’s part of that movement to get out there and create something yourself.”Though traditional oyster season has just come to a close, modern aquaculture growing techniques have helped to extend Elliott’s oyster program year-round. Spaulding is able to offer 10 to 15 varieties at the moment, a number that rises to around 30 in the fall. Current standouts include the Sweetwater varietal, an oyster from the nearby San Juan Islands chain, offering mineral notes and a subtle sweetness. Also consider the Bald Point oyster, hailing from the Hood Canal in southwestern Washington, just a few hours from Elliott’s pier-top perch on the Seattle waterfront. According to Elliott’s head shucker, Jorge Hernandez, spring rain runoff in the region helps to sweeten the overall taste of the Bald Points, imbuing them with a local earthiness that matches the gray skies, soft rain drizzle and sea breeze coming off the Puget Sound — a climatic possibility even in July."

He is survived by his wife Suzanne (Soozi), three children: Mark Cameron (Laurie Kadet), Tricia Kleinberg (David), and Kim Iarocci (John), two step-children: George Glasser (Alexandra) and Toni O'Brien (Andy), ten grandchildren: Kevin, Madeline, and Steven (Kleinberg), Melissa, Jenna, and Raina (Iarocci), Charlotte and Thomas (Glasser) and Tara and Drew (O'Brien), as well as his sister Lee Slocum. Kim graduated White Plains High School in New York and attended Williams College. After serving honorably during the Korean Conflict, he joined ARAMCO, working in the treasury department. A few years later, he met Emmett Leahy and joined the consulting firm Leahy and Company where he became a respected expert in the field of records management. Upon Leahy's death in 1964, Kim assumed control of the company and changed the focus of the business to record storage and management. Under his leadership Leahy Business Archives became one of the largest record storage companies in the US. In addition to authoring books on the subject of records management, Kim was a strong supporter of ARMA (Association of Records Managers and Administrators) and the founder of the Emmett Leahy Award for records management excellence. Upon his retirement as owner and CEO of Leahy Business Archives, Kim stayed active in the field and eventually retired to Tequesta, Florida.

That is, until she realizes that Brick (Atticus Shaffer, above, with Ms. Heaton) has three days to complete a big assignment he has put off for the year or risk being held back in the third grade by Ms. Rinsky (Doris Roberts). Meanwhile, Axl (Charlie McDermott) has failed to fulfill his required 30 days of community service. And Sue (Eden Sher) must prove that she never took a sick day from school to receive a perfect-attendance award at her graduation ceremony. In ''Modern Family,'' at 9, all that Jay (Ed O'Neill) wants for his birthday is a quiet day fishing on the lake. But everyone else insists on a big celebration. While planning the blowout, Claire (Julie Bowen) and Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) end up trapped in the yard of their childhood home; Phil (Ty Burrell) runs into his college nemesis at the mall; and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) finds his bakery expedition anything but a piece of cake.

That self-consciousness registers throughout the half-hour show; it rang through clearly in the premiere episode last Tuesday, when the host, the blogger and online reporter Shira Lazar, announced: ''We are all about the trending topics and stories the world is sharing. It's what you need to know to be in the now.'' What's obviously different about ''What's Trending,'' which will webcast its second episode Tuesday at 1 p.m. Eastern time, is its approach to the news -- its content and format -- an area in which it's already been taken to task. It's probably unfair, or at least unrealistic, to criticize the show for a lack of seriousness or news judgment, given its premise and its Twitter-driven title. In the premiere episode the struggle by Ms. Lazar and her producers to find an intelligent way to discuss current events through the lenses of Facebook and Twitter (here, as in most discussions, the alpha and omega of social networking) was palpable and mostly unsuccessful."

2011-05-25T00:00:00Z,"SMITH--Quentin I.,Jr., died peacefully on May 20, 2011 after a short illness. He was 83 years old and a resident of Kendal-on-Hudson in Sleepy Hollow, NY at the time of his death. Born in New York City, Quentin was the eldest son of Alice Lawson Smith and Quentin Irving Smith. He grew up in Edgemont, NY and graduated from Scarsdale High School, where he met his wife of sixty years, Beverly Pertsch. After a stint in the Army, Quentin graduated in 1950 from Yale University where, among other activities, he played on the varsity baseball team. He also graduated from the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard Business School. Quentin began his business career at the Prudential Insurance Company. In 1957, he joined Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby Inc, later known as Towers Perrin and now part of Towers Watson, a leading international management consulting company. He rose through the ranks at TPF&C and, in 1971, at the age of 44, became the firm's President and Chief Executive Officer, a position he held until his retirement in 1987. During Quentin's tenure, TPF&C grew from a firm with annual revenues of $12 million and a few offices to a business with annual revenues of close to $500 million, thousands of employees and offices around the globe. He helped to engineer a series of strategic acquisitions that diversified the company's service offerings and transformed it into one of the largest, privately-held consulting firms in the world. Quentin's colleagues credited him with transitioning TPF&C from a loose coalition of individual practitioners into a focused, disciplined and integrated worldwide professional services firm, a leader in its field. Quentin was a tireless executive who valued greatly all the people he worked with regardless of position or title. During his career, Quentin also proudly served as a member of the Board of Directors of The Guardian Life Insurance Company, The J. Walter Thompson Company, Omnicom Group, UGI Corporation, and the Employee Benefit Research Institute. In retirement, Quentin lived in Sanibel Island and Boca Grande, FL, as well as East Orleans, MA. He was a fixture at his grandchildren's many sporting events, concerts, and plays. He also performed volunteer work for the United Nations. He continued his lifelong passion for baseball, always watching and rooting for the New York Yankees and personally playing softball well into his seventies in the Cape Cod Old Timers Softball League. He was an avid tennis player and occasional golfer. He was a long time member of the Eastward Ho Golf Club in Chatham, MA and Shenorock Shore Club in Rye, NY. Quentin was a wonderful man and leaves behind many adoring family members. In addition to his wife Beverly, Quentin is survived by two brothers, Peter L. Smith of Richland, Washington and Donald L. Smith of Rock Island, IL, his three children, Jeffrey Q. Smith of Purchase, NY, Lance A. Smith of Westport, CT, and Karen L. (Smith) Salinaro of Hastings on Hudson, NY, their spouses, seven grandchildren, and a host of extended family in Florida and elsewhere. When in the last several years his health deteriorated and his activities became much more limited, his spirit remained strong. Quentin always had a smile and wave for those he saw. He never stopped caring about his family, friends, and former colleagues. He will be greatly missed. Quentin was interred at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, NY following a private family ceremony. A memorial service to celebrate his life will be held in New York City during June. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made in Quentin's name to support either research into the aging brain under the direction of Dr. Richard Mayeux, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, or Yale University, Ray Tompkins Associates, P.O.

(An olive-green cotton poplin shirtdress with gold accents is named after Botica’s younger sibling, Faith, $125.) “Our clothes block both UVB, which causes burning and tanning, and UVA rays, which cause aging, wrinkles, sunspots, and skin cancer.” This summer, a portion of Mott 50’s proceeds will go towards cancer research.

""Someone who just liked my style one day unexpectedly asked me if I wanted to work on the line with him,"" says Mott. Perhaps because of his background in architecture, the New York-based designer, who is 33, is very particular about the construction of his unisex private label line. The clothes have been featured alongside Rick Owens, Ann Demeulemeester and Yohji Yamamoto in editorials for ""SOME/THINGS"" magazine. His collection includes hand-painted striped tops (five to six hours of painting) that are frayed in all the right places (36 hours to machine-sew and hand finish) and have the perfect dose of weight to shield against a cool spring breeze. The fit is boyish and over sized but the imperfection of the lines add a touch of whimsy. The collection also has unconventionally shaped short jackets (another three to five days of sewing) and rich-hued duffel coats with detachable hoods (hand sewn for eight to nine days). ""Architecture gives you a set of problem-solving skills,"" he says. ""Once I started sewing, I got very into cutting patterns, developing stitches and constructing things."" Each collection has only about a dozen pieces and is only available through special order. ""When things become large, you can't control it,"" says Mott. That firm control of his process, he says, is the most exciting part of clothing making. ""If the process become boring, I'll quit."""

It just might work. What would James Joyce think of Twitter? More important, what would his handle be? It's impossible not to imagine the inherent fun the great English-language experimentalist would find in translating his voluminous ideas onto the 140-character template, or at least the irresistible challenge. On June 16, Bloomsday for those not in the know, lovers of Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom (no relation) and Molly will have the opportunity to dip into the mind of Joyce and try to tweet his thoughts. Ulysses Meets Twitter 2011, a project created by one ''Stephen from Baltimore,'' invites devotees of the approximately 265,000-word work to recast the novel through tweets from start to finish within the 24-hour period that the novel's odyssey through Dublin (on June 16, 1904) takes place. ''Would it be horrific? Beatific? Hence this experiment,'' Stephen asks. We'll find out, but for now the call is out for a global-volunteer army to tweet ''Ulysses'' on the @11ysses account. All volunteers need to do is choose a section, or several, from the 18 episodes, structured loosely on Homer's epic, ''then thoughtfully, soulfully, fancifully compose a series of 4-6 tweets to represent that section.'' You have until May 30. More information is available at 11ysses.wordpress.com. Circe is taken."

Its limited run will now end on Aug. 21, having previously been scheduled to conclude on July 24. The play, which is directed by Ian Rickson and which also stars Mackenzie Crook and John Gallagher Jr. as members of Johnny's entourage of hangers-on, has been a critical smash since its April opening; reviewing ''Jerusalem'' for The New York Times, Ben Brantley described it as a work that ''thinks big - transcendently big - in ways contemporary drama seldom dares.''

2011-05-26T00:00:00Z,"''Godspell,'' the parable-driven musical based on the Gospel of Matthew that ran on various New York stages from 1971 to 1977, will be revived on Broadway for the first time this fall, the producers announced on Wednesday. The revival had originally been aiming to open on Broadway in the summer of 2008 but its financing plans did not come together, largely due to the approaching economic recession. The lead producer of the upcoming production, Ken Davenport, said on Wednesday that the musical would be staged at Broadway's only in-the-round theater, Circle in the Square. Preview performances of the open-ended run are scheduled to begin on Oct. 13, with an opening night of Nov. 7. Daniel Goldstein will make his Broadway debut as director; among his previous credits are the 2007 Off Broadway musical ''Walmartopia,'' and a production of ''Godspell'' at the Paper Mill Playhouse in 2006. The choreographer will be Christopher Gattelli, a Tony Award nominee for Lincoln Center Theater's revival of ''South Pacific.''"

Its concertmaster of 23 years, Emmanuelle Boisvert, is moving to the Dallas Symphony Orchestra as an associate concertmaster. The announcement, which came on Wednesday, was made not by the Detroit Symphony but by a committee of orchestra members that was set up during the strike and sponsored their own concerts. The orchestra's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Weigandt, confirmed the move and said Ms. Boisvert had told the players but not yet formally informed orchestra management. ''Management has the news release, and that's what we've got,'' she said. In a statement, Ms. Boisvert said she performed with Dallas during the strike several times and, in what could be seen as a stab at Detroit's management, said she marveled at the Dallas Symphony's ''commitment to classical music, the intrinsic respect offered to musicians by the administration and esteemed music director, Jaap van Zweden, and the emphasis they place on communication and teamwork at all levels.''"

Since then more than 500 people have ended their lives using the law. This film from Peter D. Richardson, which won the grand jury prize for an American documentary at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, explores the law through the stories of those who have considered using their legal options, including Cody Curtis, 54, above, a woman suffering from liver cancer who has obtained lethal barbiturates to hold in reserve as a final option. ''It's very comforting to know they are here,'' she says. ''It's my choice when to take them and whether to take them.'' Among those not so comforted is Randy Stroup, 53 -- uninsured, with prostate cancer -- who is outraged when he is denied health care and offered doctor-assisted suicide instead. The film also follows the campaign of a woman intent on honoring her husband by fighting for a similar act in Washington State. 10:30 A.M.

Opera officials have so far remained silent on what they will present next season or where. The Guild, which represents singers, chorus members, dancers, stage managers and directors, said City Opera was using the move to break its contractual obligations and had refused to negotiate or provide any information about it. The Guild filed its complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, and said it would ask the board to seek a federal court injunction barring the move. A departure would leave the performers' lives and careers ''irreparably damaged,'' said Alan S. Gordon, the Guild's executive director. The union also accused the company of violating the contract by failing to tell its members the number of guaranteed weeks they would have next season.

2011-05-27T00:00:00Z,"In 1995, some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were massacred in the town of Srebrenica. It was the worst ethnically motivated mass murder in Europe since World War II. Now, finally, Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb general who masterminded that butchery, is where he should be -- in custody, facing prosecution before the International Criminal Court and, we hope, a lifetime in prison. The arrest should be a warning to other butchers that they, too, will be caught and held to account, no matter how long it takes. It is also a reminder that sustained international pressure works. Europe's leaders made Mr. Mladic's capture and delivery to The Hague a condition for Serbia's admission to the European Union."

With profound and abiding sadness, the staff, trustees and members of the corporation of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution mourn the death of friend and colleague John Stewart, a Life Trustee whose influence on our organization, as on so many others he served in a volunteer capacity, was fundamentally enhancing. John was a mentor and counselor who shared freely his time and the benefit of his long experience, broad perspective, and enormous intelligence. He considered thoughtfully every context, he listened carefully before expressing his view, and he offered invariably keen and creative insights tempered with a remarkable grace, natural humility, and gentle humor. John loved the ocean, was an accomplished sailor and aviator, and possessed the same need to explore, discover, understand, and share that drives our scientific mission.

He became a Partner of McKinsey in 1967 and retired as a Special Status Director in 1998. John was a revered and gracious presence and a beloved colleague. Possessing one of the most brilliant minds of his era, he relished the problem solving process and was known for his penetrating questions, imaginative thinking, and stunning insights. With a self-effacing style and a fondness for parables, he became a masterful counselor to CEOs, who cherished his wisdom, his great humanity, and his deep instinct to help. So did we.

The movie, an erotic Hong Kong period drama called ''3D Sex and Zen: Extreme Ecstasy'' and directed by Christopher Sun, is a remake of a 1991 film called ''Sex and Zen,'' which in turn is adapted from a 17th-century work of Chinese erotic fiction known as ''The Carnal Prayer Mat.'' (Among its characters are a lascivious scholar, his virginal bride, a duke with an estimable harem and a horse.) Explaining his film to Reuters last summer, Mr. Sun said that if audiences are going to pay additional ticket costs for 3-D movies, they should ''get into a world they've never seen before.''

I’ve been a bit wary of India in the past, previously noting that the tech sector accomplishments are real but have tiny employment and that solid chunks of India remain abysmally undeveloped. That’s still true, but my latest trip leaves me more optimistic. India is steadily evolving in the right direction — while in China there’s reason for more caution. Under President Hu Jintao, China’s evolution has paused, and there probably won’t be more movement until after the Communist Party Congress in late 2012 installs Xi Jinping as Hu’s successor. I still would never bet against China, but I think India may be able to narrow the gap in the coming years."

2011-05-28T00:00:00Z,"Small museums don't often find themselves at the center of international investigations, but last year the Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Ky., did, when agents from the Department of Homeland Security tracked an altarpiece stolen in Italy in 1971 to the Speed's store rooms. The piece, a triptych featuring a Madonna and child that may date from as long ago as the 14th century, was stolen from a villa in Goito, southwest of Verona; two years later, the museum bought it from Newhouse Galleries in New York for $38,000. Under a settlement negotiated by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and announced on Monday, the Speed will soon turn over the work to Homeland Security, which will transfer it to Italian cultural authorities. (The collector who had owned it in 1971 has since died, and the authorities will be responsible for determining who is now entitled to the work.) Before that, however, the museum will show the painting, which it has not exhibited for at least a decade, from June 9 to July 3 as part of a small exhibit that will, according to the museum's director, Charles L. Venable, ''contextualize it in a larger world of provenance research and repatriation of works of art.'' In addition to the unsolved mystery of how the altarpiece got from Italy to the gallery in New York, there are other questions, including who painted it and whether it is actually a 14th-century work, as some scholars have argued, or a 19th-century painting in the style of a 14th-century one, as others have suggested. In part because of the uncertainties of attribution and dating, Mr. Venable said that the museum valued the painting today at $38,000 - the same price it paid in 1973."

2011-05-28T00:00:00Z,"MANDEL--Irwin D.,DDS. Professor Emeritus of Dental Medicine of the Columbia University College of Dental Medicine, passed away on May 26, 2011. Dr. Irwin Mandel was born on April 9, 1922. He and his wife Charlotte, an award-winning poet and teacher, had two daughters, Nora and Carol, and a son, Richard. With the exception of two stints in the Navy Dental Corps (1945-1946 and 1952-1954), Dr. Mandel spent his entire career at Columbia, where he received his dental degree in 1945. Prior to that, Irwin graduated from the College of the City of New York in 1942. He began as a research assistant in 1946, and gave up his part-time private practice in 1968 to devote himself full-time to research and teaching. He founded and served as the director of the Division of Preventive Dentistry at Columbia, the first such department in the country, and also served as the founding director of the Center for Clinical Research in Dentistry, and as the Dental School's Associate Dean for Research before attaining emeritus status in 1992. A past president of the American Association for Dental Research, his many awards include the first Gold Medal Award for Excellence in Dental Research from the American Dental Association (1985). Other honors include the Award for Leadership in Periodontology from Tufts University (1971), the International Award from the University of Connecticut (1979), the Jarvie-Burkhardt International Award given by the New York State Dental Association (1990), and the Distinguished Service Award from the American Association of Public Health Dentistry (1991). Dr. Mandel received the honorary degree of Doctor of Science (honoris causa) from Columbia University in 1996. He also holds honorary degrees from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (1981) and the University of Goteborg, Sweden (1994). As part of Columbia University's 250th anniversary celebration, Irwin was honored as one of the Columbians Ahead of Their Time and at a symposium held at the Dental School. Author of over 225 scientific articles and 18 books or book chapters, Dr. Mandel conducted pioneering research on the role of dental plaque in tooth decay and periodontal disease, and is also known for studies of salivary composition as it relates to dental disease and systemic disease. As a researcher, author, and teacher, Irwin D. Mandel played a major role in shifting the focus of dentistry from repair to prevention. Until recently, Dr. Mandel served as a consultant and research mentor on several projects. He was Chief Dental Advisor to Consumers Union and its publications, a position he held for nearly 50 years. He was also a consultant and spokesperson for the American Dental Association, Associate Editor of the Journal of Dental Research, and a grants reviewer for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. He was an active writer and reviewer for the Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health (2000), and served as the preventive dentistry consultant to NASA's manned mission to Mars project. Irwin's influence on generations of dental students at Columbia was enormous. He emphasized the need to translate research findings into improved clinical care. Irwin will be remembered for his prodigious intellect, sharp wit, and his devotion to Columbia and the profession of dentistry. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Charlotte, his daughters Nora and Carol, his son Richard, and members of his family. In lieu of flowers, Dr. Mandel's family has requested that donations in his memory be sent to the College of Dental Medicine, Irwin D. Mandel Research Fund, 630 West 168 St., New York, NY 10032.

The salvo from the American Guild of Musical Artists comes nearly a week after City Opera said it could no longer afford to stay at the arts complex. Opera officials have so far remained silent on what they will present next season or where. The Guild, which represents singers, chorus members, dancers, stage managers and directors, said City Opera was using the move to break its contractual obligations and had refused to negotiate or provide any information about it. The Guild filed its complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, and said it would ask the board to seek a federal court injunction barring the move. A departure would leave the performers' lives and careers ''irreparably damaged,'' said Alan S. Gordon, the Guild's executive director. The union also accused the company of violating the contract by failing to tell its members the number of guaranteed weeks they would have next season. City Opera did not immediately return a call seeking comment."

2011-05-29T00:00:00Z,"FROM the recent string of crises at symphony orchestras you might conclude that orchestral business models are as outdated as the musicians' Victorian attire. The Philadelphia Orchestra filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April; the Honolulu Symphony and the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra recently folded; and musicians of the Detroit Symphony had their pay cut after a six-month strike. In a turbulent economy that has carried a wide range of organizations, including arts groups, banks and newspapers, to the brink, orchestras are being forced to re-examine their missions and structures to accommodate a changing fiscal and social landscape. ''Music Makes a City,'' an engaging documentary from last year about the Louisville Orchestra that was just released on DVD, offers an inspiring and cautionary tale of creative chutzpah and financial mismanagement. The orchestra, which itself filed for bankruptcy in December, was founded shortly after the floods that crippled Louisville, Ky., in 1937."

2011-05-29T00:00:00Z,"NAKONECHNY--Donald S.,MD, July 13, 1944 - May 20, 2011. After a recent diagnosis of cancer, Donald S. Nakonechny, (Donny) a long-time Seattle pathologist, died peacefully at home in the company of his wife, Patti McCall, and son, Lyle Nakonechny. Don shared a memorable story with everyone he met and loved a good meal while learning about the lives and thoughts of his friends and family. The spectrum of his interests, studies, skills, and joys was shaped by the quality of people and the environment around him. He loved his family, his friends, his Cairn terriers, and the Pacific Northwest. Don had a wonderful 40-year career as a pathologist and was deeply committed to helping people up to the day of his death. Donny was proud to have been born into the cultural diversity of Manhattan, New York. Much of his childhood was spent with his grandmother, learning about his Ukrainian heritage and enjoying the borscht, chopped liver, potato latkes and other foods of his family's old-world traditions. As a young boy exploring in New York City, Donny found a snake at the edge of Central Park and brought it straight to the American Museum of Natural History. The snake had escaped from the Museum only days before and the research staff rewarded him with a special tour of the Museum that ignited a life-long love of science and the natural world. His love of science and nature grew to include the arts and literature when Don was given a scholarship to attend Regis High School in New York City. It was here he learned Homer's song of the sirens in ancient Greek, discovered his love for Bach and Mozart, and was introduced to the physics and art of optics and microscopy. Following Regis High School, Don attended New York University, Saint Louis University Medical School, and finally moved to Seattle for a pathology residency at the University of Washington Medical School. Following his UW residency, Don worked with Dr. Don Reay in the King County Medical Examiner's Office applying his skills of observation, science, and art to forensic pathology. These busy times of field and laboratory forensics were tempered with Herzog film festivals, Bob Marley concerts, academic lectures, and swimming. He also learned to scuba dive, forage for wild mushroom, and fish the local waters. Donny and his son, Lyle, spent many hours diving, fishing and rock hunting. Don's heart belonged to his family, his friends and his work. He took both great pleasure and pride in his West Seattle home and his home on the Washington Long Beach Peninsula. The curiosity and joy with which he approached life endeared him to nearly every life he touched and he will be deeply missed. On Saturday, June 4, 2011 from 12:30 to 3:30pm, the family has planned a celebration of Donny's life at Ray's Boathouse (The Northwest Room), at 6049 Seaview Avenue NW, Seattle, WA 98107. In lieu of flowers or gifts, Donny would have loved supporting the school that fostered his curiosity for life. Donations should be sent in memory of Donald S. Nakonechny, Class of '62: Regis High School, 55 East 84th Street, New York, NY 10028-0884."

Drabek wears No. 4, which he wore as a high school wide receiver in suburban Houston. His baseball uniform was No. 1. When he got to pro ball, he was startled to see his uniform."

2011-05-29T00:00:00Z,"SMITH--Quentin I.,Jr., died peacefully on May 20, 2011 after a short illness. He was 83 years old and a resident of Kendal-on-Hudson in Sleepy Hollow, NY at the time of his death. Born in New York City, Quentin was the eldest son of Alice Lawson Smith and Quentin Irving Smith. He grew up in Edgemont, NY and graduated from Scarsdale High School, where he met his wife of sixty years, Beverly Pertsch. After a stint in the Army, Quentin graduated in 1950 from Yale University where, among other activities, he played on the varsity baseball team. He also graduated from the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard Business School. Quentin began his business career at the Prudential Insurance Company. In 1957, he joined Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby Inc, later known as Towers Perrin and now part of Towers Watson, a leading international management consulting company. He rose through the ranks at TPF&C and, in 1971, at the age of 44, became the firm's President and Chief Executive Officer, a position he held until his retirement in 1987. During Quentin's tenure, TPF&C grew from a firm with annual revenues of $12 million and a few offices to a business with annual revenues of close to $500 million, thousands of employees and offices around the globe. He helped to engineer a series of strategic acquisitions that diversified the company's service offerings and transformed it into one of the largest, privately-held consulting firms in the world. Quentin's colleagues credited him with transitioning TPF&C from a loose coalition of individual practitioners into a focused, disciplined and integrated worldwide professional services firm, a leader in its field. Quentin was a tireless executive who valued greatly all the people he worked with regardless of position or title. During his career, Quentin also proudly served as a member of the Board of Directors of The Guardian Life Insurance Company, The J. Walter Thompson Company, Omnicom Group, UGI Corporation, and the Employee Benefit Research Institute. In retirement, Quentin lived in Sanibel Island and Boca Grande, FL, as well as East Orleans, MA. He was a fixture at his grandchildren's many sporting events, concerts, and plays. He also performed volunteer work for the United Nations. He continued his lifelong passion for baseball, always watching and rooting for the New York Yankees and personally playing softball well into his seventies in the Cape Cod Old Timers Softball League. He was an avid tennis player and occasional golfer. He was a long time member of the Eastward Ho Golf Club in Chatham, MA and Shenorock Shore Club in Rye, NY. Quentin was a wonderful man and leaves behind many adoring family members. In addition to his wife Beverly, Quentin is survived by two brothers, Peter L. Smith of Richland, Washington and Donald L. Smith of Rock Island, IL, his three children, Jeffrey Q. Smith of Purchase, NY, Lance A. Smith of Westport, CT, and Karen L. (Smith) Salinaro of Hastings on Hudson, NY, their spouses, seven grandchildren, and a host of extended family in Florida and elsewhere. When in the last several years his health deteriorated and his activities became much more limited, his spirit remained strong. Quentin always had a smile and wave for those he saw. He never stopped caring about his family, friends, and former colleagues. He will be greatly missed. Quentin was interred at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, NY following a private family ceremony. A memorial service to celebrate his life will be held in New York City during June.

Bill was a veteran of World War II, serving in the Air Force, and received a Purple Heart after being wounded in France. Prior to the war he played semi-professional football. Following the war he attended Newark College of Engineering. Bill spent the better part of his 50-year career in construction with Morse Diesel International Inc. Bill's expertise and accomplishments spanned the gamut of commercial, industrial, and correctional facility construction. In his career, Bill guided a number of corporate America's major construction projects, including facilities for Phillip Morris, Coco Cola and Schering Plough. His work for Phillip Morris, in particular, included monumental projects in the late 1970s and early 80s such as the Park Avenue headquarters building near Grand Central Station and three huge tobacco manufacturing facilities in Richmond VA, Louisville, KY and Cabarrus County, NC in all, totaling about three million square feet. His projects for this client also encompassed major industrial manufacturing facilities and laboratories for General Foods and major breweries nationwide for Miller Brewing Company. Bill was also at one time perhaps the nation's foremost authority on construction of correctional facilities. His criminal justice projects included correctional treatment facilities in Washington, D.C., West Palm Beach, and Bradford, PA. He was also responsible for the rebuilding of the Manhattan House of Detention into a modern maximum security facility near Greenwich Village, and the expansion of the Otis Bantum Correctional Center on Rikers Island. He will always be remembered for his love of the New York Giants, the Arts, sailing, skiing, and especially for sharing these experiences with family and extended family.

He served in the US Navy from 1953 - 1955 and as a program manager for TRW's Saturn missile project. In 1961 he joined McKinsey & Company where for 37 years, he dedicated himself to client service. In addition, he served on the Defense Science Board, Yale University Council, National Council on Economic Education and as Executive Director of the US National Commission on Productivity. Most recently, he was a trustee of NYU Medical Center, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and on the Dean's Advisory Council at Boston University School of Medicine. He also consulted with a Gates Foundation initiative to reduce HIV/AIDS in India. John's many civic commitments reflected his lifelong interest in the intersection of management with science and economics, and a deeply held belief in ""giving back"". Even his love of flying became a way to help others through Angel Flights. John was a great human being. He brought integrity, creativity and compassion to every endeavor with family, with friends and with professional colleagues. He had a unique way of guiding those around him to new and deeper insight. And he was a lot of fun to be around. He loved his family: his wife, Eliot; their four children: Diane Stewart, Sandi Stewart, Ian Highet and Eliot Patty; and nine grandchildren: Anna, Colin, Ali, Dash, Gil, Lisa, Andrew, Liam and Eliza.

Gary Sinise and Joe Mantegna (near right, with Mr. Sinise) team up for the sixth time as hosts of this live broadcast from the West Lawn of the United States Capitol. Forest Whitaker, Dianne Wiest, B. B. King, Jason Ritter, A. J.

Other participants include members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as well as the United States Army Herald Trumpets, the United States Army Chorus, the Soldiers' Chorus of the United States Army Field Band, the United States Navy Sea Chanters and the United States Air Force Singing Sergeants, along with color guards and service flags from each branch of the armed services. 6 A.M.

The prime-time segment begins at 8 p.m. with ''The Story of G.I. Joe'' (1945), in which Ernie Pyle, the Scripps-Howard war correspondent (played by Burgess Meredith), joins an Army platoon during World War II to learn what battle is really about. Reviewing the film, by William A. Wellman, in The New York Times, Thomas M. Pryor said, ''It is humorous, poignant and tragic, an earnestly human reflection of a stern life and the dignity of man.''"

Sloane, a wealthy carpet manufacturer who was furnishing the new mansions, hotels and clubs of the city, deeded a mansion on the Upper East Side to his wife. It was soon confirmed that Mr. Sloane's wife, Jessie, had taken up with another man, and she married him a mere five hours after divorcing Mr. Sloane. So Mr. Sloane set out to build himself a new mansion at 18 East 68th Street, off Fifth Avenue."

Sales of studios and one-bedrooms rebounded first after the market crashed in late 2008, followed by three-bedrooms, but it wasn't until mid-2010 that the two-bedroom market started its comeback. Now, brokers say that the demand for smaller apartments has ebbed and that two-bedroom apartments are all the rage, especially those priced at the lower end of the market."

John joined McKinsey in 1961, with degrees from Yale and the Harvard Business School, after serving in the U.S. Navy and working at TRW. He became a Partner of McKinsey in 1967 and retired as a Special Status Director in 1998. John was a revered and gracious presence and a beloved colleague. Possessing one of the most brilliant minds of his era, he relished the problem solving process and was known for his penetrating questions, imaginative thinking, and stunning insights. With a self-effacing style and a fondness for parables, he became a masterful counselor to CEOs, who cherished his wisdom, his great humanity, and his deep instinct to help. So did we. To John's wife, Eliot, his children, and the rest of his family, we offer our deepest condolences and join in mourning the loss of a great man."

2011-05-29T00:00:00Z,"WITH Memorial Day upon us, and with it a summer driving season marked by high prices at the gas pump, it seems a fitting time to look at the electric car. How do the fuel and environmental costs of running one compare with the costs of a conventional car, or even the electricity to run appliances in your home? (Such details are on the minds of federal officials, who last week unveiled new fuel-economy stickers for vehicles, starting with the 2013 model year.) The figures on this page are only one way of crunching the numbers. They focus on the Nissan Leaf, among the first purely battery-powered electrics now on the market. (The much-publicized Chevrolet Volt is a plug-in electric-gas hybrid.) The comparisons reflect the immediate expense of running the cars or appliances shown -- the price incurred from pump or plug to car or device. They do not factor in manufacturing costs or purchase prices; maintenance expenses (like replacing an electric car's battery); the cost of the car's home charger; or even home electrical upgrades, if needed."

The dark-suited and hatted dancer who had played the “Big Boss” in the delightful tale of murder and mayhem at the ballet, had just popped out of the wings, performed a quick, modest salute, and popped back in. It took a moment to realize that the Big Boss was in fact the Big Boss. Peter Martins, the ballet master in chief of the company, had stepped in for an injured Ask la Cour the previous night, and reappeared at the matinee with no fanfare or announcement of the change in cast. Mr. Martins, who retired from dancing in 1983, hasn’t appeared onstage since dancing in a pas de deux with Suzanne Farrell at her farewell performance in 1989. But he clearly hasn’t forgotten the tricks of the trade, even jumping nimbly off a high table (those of us who had recognized him winced for his knees) and rolling on the floor as he fought Andrew Veyette as the Hoofer. The only concession Mr. Martins made to age and experience was to forgo wearing tights. We understand."

2011-05-30T00:00:00Z,"FISHEL--James W.,James W. Fishel, an advertising executive for more than 50 years and former president of Fairfax Advertising Agency, a division of Saatchi & Saatchi Worldwide, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 93 years old. A native of New York City, Mr. Fishel attended the city's public schools. After graduating from Washington & Lee University in 1939, Mr. Fishel began his career at a small New York advertising agency, Jasper and Lynch. In 1949, he and his brother, the late Stanley I. Fishel, who was also a member of the firm, resigned and became principals of Fairfax. James Fishel served as president and CEO of the Fairfax agency from 1976 until 1983, when the company was acquired by Saatchi & Saatchi. Mr. Fishel remained as CEO of the division until 1989, when he retired. Mr. Fishel was a pioneer in the advertising mail order industry, introducing clients to the concept of television commercials by persuading well-known television stars such as Dave Garroway, Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Johnny Carson and Hugh Downs to do live commercials. This approach changed advertising strategy and helped turn unknown companies into household names, including Miracle-Gro and GNC. In addition, Mr. Fishel was a pioneer in the use of multi-page inserts in mass-circulation magazines featuring the products of leading mail-order companies. After his retirement from Saatchi & Saatchi, Mr. Fishel devoted his time to pro bono work. He served as advertising manager for ""New Youth Connections,"" a city-wide news magazine written by New York City teenagers trained in journalism at the publication and delivered to more than 200,000 students in the city's high schools. Mr. Fishel served on the board of directors of the 92nd St. Y for 50 years. He was also a long-time member of the Harmonie Club and an accomplished player of tennis and squash. Mr. Fishel was an Army veteran of World War II and achieved the rank of Major. Mr. Fishel was married to the late Edith (Rubin) Fishel for more than 50 years. He is survived by his two daughters: the writer Elizabeth Fishel of Oakland, CA, as well as her husband, Robert Houghteling and their sons, Nate and Will; and Anne Fishel, a clinical psychologist and professor at Harvard Medical School, of Newton, MA, as well as her husband, Chris Daly, and their sons, Gabe and Joe. He is also survived by his companion, Catherine Kinsey of Sayville, NY. He was beloved by his family and his many friends for his kindness, his humor, his sense of fun, and his love of life. A funeral service will be held at 11:30am, Tuesday at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th St., New York. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Youth Communication 224 W. 29th St. New York, NY 10001."
2011-05-30T00:00:00Z,"While you theatergoing butterflies out there keep nattering on about the Tonys - who will win, who should win, and so on - I have been focused on an issue of far greater momentousness and urgency. That's the shameful squandering on Broadway of what our country would seem to believe is our most valued (and infinitely exploitable) natural resource: our celebrities. It has become a fact of cultural life in New York that a theater producer in search of big box office will seek out a famous person, regardless of his or her talents or credentials. Famous people of all stripes are returning the compliment by looking to Broadway to rejuvenate their careers, enhance their artistic credibility and pitch woo to audiences that may have ceased to believe in their existence."

The program, started in 2008 by Fordham University's public station WFUV-FM with support from the New York State Music Fund, has showcased artists like the Strokes and TV on the Radio as well as newer local groups like Freelance Whales. Chuck Singleton, WFUV's program director, said that the show was created to fill a void by bringing together a music community but that had been primarily an online and HD radio service, with just a 10 p.m.-to-midnight broadcast on WFUV (90.7 FM).

And when the mode of the road is rail, as it still is for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey, that logical problem can get boiled down further still, to the personal space. How, to cite just one example, does a family living in a narrow rail-car apartment make room for a piano and lessons for the children? For the Iversons -- Jonathan, ringmaster and father; Priscilla, performer and mother; Felipe, a budding musician and their son -- making it work is just another form of juggling.

2011-05-31T13:17:37Z,"As if to prove that there are no supernatural forces working against Peter Jackson’s “Hobbit” movies, for which that director has already contended with a labor dispute, the occasional explosion and emergency ulcer surgery, the studios have settled on some interesting release dates for the two-part fantasy epic. New Line Cinema, Warner Brothers and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer said in a joint statement reported by The Associated Press that the first “Hobbit” movie would open on Dec. 14, 2012, when some scholars say is the 509th anniversary of the birth of Nostradamus, the French astrologer and soothsayer. (Historical spoilsports say he was born on Dec. 21.) And the concluding “Hobbit” film will be released on Dec. 13, 2013, a date that not only has two 13s but is also, wouldn’t you know it, Friday the 13th."

In fairness, Katie Ermilio, who interned at Vogue, had a stint at Teen Vogue before leaving to devote herself full time to making clothes. “I grew up in the business,” says Ermilio, whose dad owns Ermilio Clothiers, a bespoke men’s-wear shop in Philadelphia. “But I always thought I was going to be a fashion editor — I had no interest in becoming a designer at all.”"

2011-05-31T06:00:01Z,"It’s hard for a first-round pick to move up significantly, but aside from Jose Bautista, Ryan Braun is probably the top hitter in fantasy baseball this year. While Braun’s 12 home runs and .588 slugging percentage through Sunday are improvements over last year’s rates, the number that jumps out most is his 13 steals in 14 attempts. Milwaukee’s new manager, Ron Roenicke, is more aggressive on the basepaths than his predecessor, Ken Macha: the Brewers are 14th in the majors in stolen bases this year, as opposed to 21st last year, and Braun in particular is getting the green light. At this pace, a 35-35 season is within reach, and with Braun, you’re virtually assured a good batting average. Only Carlos Gonzalez and maybe Matt Kemp offer the same speed-power-average upside, and Gonzalez is struggling this year.Jacoby Ellsbury’s 2010 was a lost season because of rib injuries, but as he is 27, his value has never been higher. The 19 stolen bases through Sunday put him on pace for close to 60 steals, and that’s not accounting for chilly early-season conditions that often slow the running game. Ellsbury also has 6 home runs and 16 doubles and is posting a .298/.368/.462 line in 208 at-bats while hitting leadoff in one of the league’s best lineups. In short, he’s what the Red Sox hoped Carl Crawford would be when they gave him $142 million. Crawford was a late first-round pick in most leagues, and Ellsbury must be considered similarly at this point."

2011-05-31T00:00:00Z,"''The Hangover Part II'' has sold about $137.4 million in tickets since opening in North American theaters on Thursday, according to results compiled by Hollywood.com. That performance helped drive robust business for the Memorial Day weekend. Audiences for the top 12 films over the four-day weekend spent about $272.8 million on tickets, up 48 percent from the same period last year. (The figures were not adjusted for inflation or to account for 3-D and Imax ticket prices.) ''The Hangover Part II'' --a sequel from Warner Brothers to the 2009 hit starring Bradley Cooper (above), Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis (who all returned for more trouble) -- ranks behind Disney's ''Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides'' as the year's second-biggest opening of 2011. ''Kung Fu Panda 2'' (Paramount) has taken in about $68 million since open- ing on Thursday, and it finished second for the weekend. ''On Stranger Tides'' fell 56 percent in its second week of release, with $50.4 million in sales over the holiday weekend, for third place; its domestic total is $164 million. ''Bridesmaids'' (Universal) was fourth, with $21 million through Monday, and ''Thor'' (Paramount) was fifth, with $12 million. Despite the strong weekend traffic at theaters, overall domestic attendance is down 9.7 percent from this point in 2010."
2011-05-31T00:00:00Z,"On a fall afternoon in 1988, Jon Sarkin, a 35-year-old Massachusetts chiropractor, was happily playing the eighth hole on a local golf course when he felt something ''twist'' in his brain. Three days later he began to hear a high-pitched screech, a siren that only grew louder with the passing weeks. Doctors shrugged; a brain scan suggested a vague abnormality near a nerve at the base of the brain that controls hearing and balance. Eight months later, driven to distraction by the unceasing noise, Dr. Sarkin underwent a controversial operation to ''decompress'' the small vessels surrounding the nerve. The day after surgery -- having woken up long enough to report that the noise had indeed stopped -- he was rushed back to the operating room with a major stroke."

But on Wall Street, a very different question is quietly being asked: Will Mr. Einhorn, one of the great value investors of his generation and an obsessive stock picker, take his eye off the ball? (Pun intended.) It is a question that invariably is raised whenever a wealthy financier seeks to live out his childhood fantasy by acquiring a professional sports team, a race horse or even a yacht."
2011-05-31T00:00:00Z,"STEWART--John MacKenzie, 79, died peacefully at home on May 19, 2011. Born in Glen Cove, NY, in 1932, he graduated from Yale University ('53) and Harvard Business School ('57). He served in the US Navy from 1953 - 1955 and as a program manager for TRW's Saturn missile project. In 1961 he joined McKinsey & Company where for 37 years, he dedicated himself to client service. In addition, he served on the Defense Science Board, Yale University Council, National Council on Economic Education and as Executive Director of the US National Commission on Productivity. Most recently, he was a trustee of NYU Medical Center, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and on the Dean's Advisory Council at Boston University School of Medicine. He also consulted with a Gates Foundation initiative to reduce HIV/AIDS in India. John's many civic commitments reflected his lifelong interest in the intersection of management with science and economics, and a deeply held belief in ""giving back"". Even his love of flying became a way to help others through Angel Flights. John was a great human being. He brought integrity, creativity and compassion to every endeavor with family, with friends and with professional colleagues. He had a unique way of guiding those around him to new and deeper insight. And he was a lot of fun to be around. He loved his family: his wife, Eliot; their four children: Diane Stewart, Sandi Stewart, Ian Highet and Eliot Patty; and nine grandchildren: Anna, Colin, Ali, Dash, Gil, Lisa, Andrew, Liam and Eliza.

2011-05-31T00:00:00Z,"A mild tremor of excitement ran through the New York City Ballet audience on Sunday afternoon as the cast of George Balanchine's ''Slaughter on Tenth Avenue'' took a bow. The dark-suited and hatted dancer who had played the ''Big Boss'' in the delightful tale of murder and mayhem at the ballet, had just popped out of the wings, performed a quick, modest salute, and popped back in. It took a moment to realize that the Big Boss was in fact the Big Boss. Peter Martins, the ballet master in chief of the company, had stepped in for an injured Ask la Cour the previous night, and reappeared at the matinee with no fanfare or announcement of the change in cast. Mr. Martins, who retired from dancing in 1983, hasn't appeared onstage since dancing in a pas de deux with Suzanne Farrell at her farewell performance in 1989. But he clearly hasn't forgotten the tricks of the trade, even jumping nimbly off a high table (those of us who had recognized him winced for his knees) and rolling on the floor as he fought Andrew Veyette as the Hoofer. The only concession Mr. Martins made to age and experience was to forgo wearing tights. We understand. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2011-05-31T00:00:00Z,"FISHEL--James W.,James W. Fishel, an advertising executive for more than 50 years and former president of Fairfax Advertising Agency, a division of Saatchi & Saatchi Worldwide, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 93 years old. A native of New York City, Mr. Fishel attended the city's public schools. After graduating from Washington & Lee University in 1939, Mr. Fishel began his career at a small New York advertising agency, Jasper and Lynch. In 1949, he and his brother, the late Stanley I. Fishel, who was also a member of the firm, resigned and became principals of Fairfax. James Fishel served as president and CEO of the Fairfax agency from 1976 until 1983, when the company was acquired by Saatchi & Saatchi. Mr. Fishel remained as CEO of the division until 1989, when he retired. Mr. Fishel was a pioneer in the advertising mail order industry, introducing clients to the concept of television commercials by persuading well-known television stars such as Dave Garroway, Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Johnny Carson and Hugh Downs to do live commercials. This approach changed advertising strategy and helped turn unknown companies into household names, including Miracle-Gro and GNC. In addition, Mr. Fishel was a pioneer in the use of multi-page inserts in mass-circulation magazines featuring the products of leading mail-order companies. After his retirement from Saatchi & Saatchi, Mr. Fishel devoted his time to pro bono work. He served as advertising manager for ""New Youth Connections,"" a city-wide news magazine written by New York City teenagers trained in journalism at the publication and delivered to more than 200,000 students in the city's high schools. Mr. Fishel served on the board of directors of the 92nd St. Y for 50 years. He was also a long-time member of the Harmonie Club and an accomplished player of tennis and squash. Mr. Fishel was an Army veteran of World War II and achieved the rank of Major. Mr. Fishel was married to the late Edith (Rubin) Fishel for more than 50 years. He is survived by his two daughters: the writer Elizabeth Fishel of Oakland, CA, as well as her husband, Robert Houghteling and their sons, Nate and Will; and Anne Fishel, a clinical psychologist and professor at Harvard Medical School, of Newton, MA, as well as her husband, Chris Daly, and their sons, Gabe and Joe. He is also survived by his companion, Catherine Kinsey of Sayville, NY. He was beloved by his family and his many friends for his kindness, his humor, his sense of fun, and his love of life. A funeral service will be held at 11:30am, Tuesday at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th St., New York. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Youth Communication 224 W. 29th St. New York, NY 10001."

Angry fishermen vowed to defend areas where they had fished and harvested seaweed for generations. Two decades later, when Chugoku Electric was considering whether to expand the plant with a third reactor, Kashima once again swung into action: this time, to rally in favor. Prodded by the local fishing cooperative, the town assembly voted 15 to 2 to make a public appeal for construction of the $4 billion reactor."

She did not mind that she was one of the people the camera kept coming back to in the film, ''Lost Bohemia.'' What had her crying was the subject matter.

There are also slimming thigh-high leather leggings that mold to one’s body, supple camel leather shirts and buttery black body-con dresses that look effortless and sensual, not overripe or overtly sexy.

2011-06-01T10:44:11Z,"VENICE — After the first day spent looking at most, but not all, of the national pavilions in the Giardini, this year’s Biennale has started to shape up as a knock-down, drag-out contest among immersive, environmental installation artworks. The battle is especially pitched on the little hillock dominated by the pavilions of Britain (Mike Nelson), Germany (Christoph Schlingensief) and France (Christian Boltanski), although the fray has also been joined by Switzerland (Thomas Hirshhorn) and the Czech Republic. At that pavilion, a little-known artist named Dominik Lang, barely 30 years old, has mounted a strangely affecting time-capsule-like installation featuring a great deal of generic postwar figurative sculpture by his father, Jiri Lang (1927-1996), who stopped making art years before his son was born. It serves as a sobering reminder of the obscurity that awaits most of the art produced at any given point in time, as well as the ability of art objects, being objects, to wait out different phases of neglect."

So when sharing an elevator with Jude Law, whether coming from the seventh floor gym or la plage across the street, is a real possibility, being caught barefaced is a bit daunting. As for my sleeping in makeup, blame Olivier Zahm and his Purple party at Le Baron, an early flight and the lack of the will to painstakingly remove the waterproof makeup I agreed to test for The Moment.

Channsin Berry and Bradinn French, “Dark Girls” takes a compelling look at the impact of colorism: a state of prejudice, conscious and unconscious, that causes both black people and white people to label as more beautiful or desirable or intelligent individuals with lighter shades of skin, particularly when it comes to black women. Few among people of color are unfamiliar with the saying: “If you are light, you are all right. If you are brown, you can stick around. If you are black, get back.” A writer in The Washington Post aptly described the phenomenon a few years ago as “the crazy aunt in the attic of racism.”"

This refurbished commissary of Kaufman Astoria Studios, a vast complex of sound stages near the Museum of the Moving Image, is an odd but rewarding new spot. The Astor Room's owner, Chris Vlacich, has made the ambitious decision to insert a Jazz Age-themed supper club, with live piano music (mercifully subdued), careful service and drinks named after the likes of Mary Pickford elegantly presented. The dinner menu, rather daringly for 2011, is devoted to old-school dishes like oysters Rockefeller and beef stroganoff that are nicely executed. The Astor Room's subterranean dining room can be gloomy, but the efforts of Mr. Vlacich (and his chef, John Doherty) deserve more recognition. (May 25) JULIA MOSKIN CHEF'S TABLE AT BROOKLYN FARE 200 Schermerhorn Street (Hoyt Street), downtown Brooklyn; (718) 243-0050; brooklynfare.com/chefs-table. César Ramirez, the chef here, stood like a ship's captain in front of the immense Molteni stove that is the centerpiece of his restaurant, framed by an immense collection of gleaming copper pots. Before him were 18 customers on stools set around a D-shaped stainless-steel bar. And before them would be placed 20 small courses over the evening. Mr. Ramirez worked for David Bouley, and he has some of that chef's precision and passion, his respect for pure ingredients. The mood in the restaurant thus swings from hushed to giddy. Everyone starts to compare notes, share insights, share wine. They celebrate the delicious. A meal at Chef's Table costs $185 a person, not including tip or the wine you take. That is either expensive or not, depending on your bank balance, but it is worth the money whatever your answer. (Reviewed April 27, ) SAM SIFTON COLONIE 127 Atlantic Avenue (Henry Street), Brooklyn Heights; (718) 855-7500; colonienyc.com. Long and lean beneath a rough-finished wooden ceiling, with a handsome bar and a wall garden of herbs leading to a brick-walled dining room and open kitchen in back, Colonie serves a mostly solid farm-to-table menu of haute American food to a building crowd. Alex Sorenson, the chef, who was at Mas (Farmhouse), serves a familiar menu of eggs and mushrooms and pork belly and scallops and beets. But his cooking does not seem overexposed or trendy. There is brightness to it, a clever happiness that often comes through on the plate. The kitchen can be inconsistent, though, and when the owners are not in, waiters, runners and bartenders alike appear to disappear. (May 4, ) SAM SIFTON GOTHAM BAR AND GRILL 12 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 620-4020; gothambarandgrill.com. In a city obsessed with the shiny and novel, this is an outlier. Open since 1984, it celebrates stability and excellence, perhaps even opulence. It is all very civilized here. Gotham has an informality of service, though, that is purely American. And Alfred Portale, who came to this Greenwich Village restaurant the year after it opened, runs a kitchen that is committed to innovation even as it celebrates the past. His life must occasionally resemble those of perpetually touring rock stars who need every night to sing the songs they wrote as teenagers. But even after more than 20 years, new songs keep coming. At Gotham, there is no recitation of the provenance of the bacon, or explanation of the wild arugula's journey, before you eat. No one offers the name of the boat whose captain whispered the tuna aboard. A meal at Gotham is about you and your interests, not of those who made it. (May 18, ) SAM SIFTON JONES WOOD FOUNDRY 401 East 76th Street, Upper East Side; (212) 249-2700; joneswoodfoundry.com. Odds are you haven't tucked into a nice plate of bangers and mash lately, or a proper Victoria spongecake filled with raspberry jam. But with well-turned dishes like those, as well as crumpets and kedgeree, parsnip soup and meat pies, Jones Wood Foundry may persuade New Yorkers to take English food seriously. The restaurant is the very definition of a gastropub, where bar food with a bit of flair is more important than drink. Jason Hicks's menu is overlarge, and thus not everything is well cooked. And service is not as professional as could be, but the happy locals and assorted expat Britons who pack the place do not seem to mind. (Dining Briefs, May 4) JULIA MOSKIN SOUVLAKI GR 116 Stanton Street (Essex Street), Lower East Side; (212) 777-0116, souvlakigr.com. Bougainvillea spills over a blazing white wall. A cobblestone sidewalk is washed white, the doors an impossible Aegean blue. So the flowers are fake, the stones painted on, and the doors and shutters open to nowhere. Somehow it feels genuine. This is due to the ministrations of the host, Abby Sierros, an owner. There is little here beyond souvlaki. The pork and chicken are moist and tender. Spices and garnishes are minimal and effective.

This documentary, directed by Susan Froemke, also features scenes between Mr. Levine and his longtime collaborator Plácido Domingo as they prepare to mount Verdi's ''Simon Boccanegra'' and with the Met Orchestra as Mr. Levine rehearses the ensemble for its first performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony at Carnegie Hall. ''Great Performances at the Met,'' at 9, presents the company's premiere production of John Adams's ''Nixon in China,'' conducted by Mr. Adams and staged by Peter Sellars. With a libretto by Alice Goodman, the opera is based on President Richard M. Nixon's visit to China in 1972. James Maddalena, in his Met debut, portrays Nixon, a role he created for the opera's world premiere in 1987.

New Line Cinema, Warner Brothers and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer said in a joint statement reported by The Associated Press that the first ''Hobbit'' movie would open on Dec. 14, 2012, when some scholars say is the 509th anniversary of the birth of Nostradamus, the French astrologer and soothsayer. (Historical spoilsports say he was born on Dec. 21.)

Then there were these lower-profile efforts to join in the debate over whether laying off 4,100 teachers was really the best way to balance the city's books: handwritten messages to the mayor taped to a big dollar sign outside a school in the Mount Eden section of the Bronx; postcards to City Council members signed at a foldout table in a school in Hell's Kitchen, parents clustered on a sidewalk in Park Slope, Brooklyn, chanting, ''Save our teachers,'' even though no one was around to hear it but parents themselves."

Showcasing an incredible array of faces — there are all different ethnicities, ages and even a sprinkling of men — the dense tome contains “before” and “after” photos (shot by Nars himself) of each subject. A transparent overlay between the two shots shows you how and where to apply makeup, which is very effective. Seeing the outline of the shape you are trying to create helps you apply product in a more accurate, efficient way. Because you have a clear view of the “before” face, which is completely bare, you can see how a primer or a sheer glow or matte foundation changes skin quality, and how a simple application of makeup can bring a feature to life or downplay it. The book challenges you to take risks, and even the most seasoned makeup wearer will be enlightened. It brought me back to my teen years, when I delighted in playing with different, even extreme, looks. Building confidence and conveying a variety of moods through makeup, Nars inspires you to be playful, passionate, imaginative and, as he says, “have an open spirit, and believe in your own beauty.” Nars’s picks from his own line of cosmetics: the Multiple, All About Eve Eyeshadow Duo, EFA Night Infusion and the AquaGel Hydrator."

2011-06-02T00:00:00Z,"The government-run developer of Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi announced that it had hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to monitor conditions for foreign laborers building the new branches of the Louvre and Guggenheim museums there. A 2009 report by Human Rights Watch raised alarms about working conditions on the island, in particular the practice of workers having to pay hefty fees to recruiters in their home countries, putting them in debt before they even start to work. Earlier this year a group of prominent Middle Eastern artists said it would boycott the new Guggenheim unless conditions were improved. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Sarah Leah Whitson, the director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch, said the appointment of an independent monitor was ''a very welcome and positive development.'' But she added that her organization still had some concerns, including the fact that the law in the United Arab Emirates, which includes Abu Dhabi, prohibits workers from forming unions or going on strike. She also called on the Guggenheim and the developer, the Tourism Development and Investment Company, to pledge to reimburse workers if their employers were found not to have covered their recruitment fees."

2011-06-02T00:00:00Z,"AT Cannes last month, the paparazzi gave Gwen Stefani (above) the royal treatment when she accessorized her 1970s-inspired Stella McCartney sequin jumpsuit with an equally glamorous disco mane. The look, side-parted with voluminous soft curls, is a ringer for the one the hairstylist and Redken creative consultant Guido Palau created for the spring shows at Sonia Rykiel (right) and Marc Jacobs -- and, according to the stylist, is simple to recreate for summer. If your hair is curly (women with God-given ringlets, stop complaining!), just tame your locks with a leave-in conditioner and use a curling iron to define more pieces throughout your hair. ''This will create even more bounce,'' Mr. Palau said. For straight hair, ''apply a light mist of a heat protector -- I use Redken Hot Sets 22 Thermal Setting Mist -- before drying hair and using a curling iron.'' If you have time, do as he did for the runway and set your curls with pins, then finger comb with a finishing gel for extra pizazz."

2011-06-02T00:00:00Z,"Broadway had another billion-dollar season between late May 2010 and Sunday, with shows grossing $1.08 billion - 5.9 percent more than the total for the 2009-10 season - and playing to more than 12.5 million people, according to the Broadway League, the trade group for theater owners and producers. That 2010-11 season attendance figure also reflects an increase of 5.4 percent over the previous season. Musicals and plays on Broadway have proved to be hardy perennials on the economic landscape for the entertainment industry, with shows steadily filling the sector's 40 theaters in Manhattan. While commercial hits are something of a rarity - only 25 to 30 percent of new shows usually turn a profit - long-running blockbusters like ''Wicked'' and ''The Lion King'' have become reliable money-makers even in bad weeks for other shows, and new additions like ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark'' and ''The Book of Mormon'' have been selling strongly."

2011-06-02T00:00:00Z,"High fashion and money have always gone together, and for the next few weeks, they will do so in the museum world as well as on the racks. The Metropolitan Museum of Art said Tuesday that its Alexander McQueen show, which it recently extended by a week to accommodate the overflow crowds, will be opened during special viewing hours on Mondays, when the Met is usually closed, for patrons willing to buy $50 tickets.-Since the show opened on May 4, more than 150,000 people have gone to see it, making for long lines and waits. The tickets, which will go on sale in early June at the museum and online at metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen, will allow entries on Mondays on the half hour, from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. beginning June 6. (The show continues through Aug. 7; tickets for Monday viewing will not be available for July 4, when the museum is open to the public as part of a special holiday program.) The McQueen show will continue to be available during the museum's regular hours with no additional charge above the Met's $20 suggested admission price. In the last several decades the museum has rarely instituted special ticket charges for exhibitions. In 2003 and 2004 it opened the museum on Mondays in the same way it is doing for the McQueen show, charging $50 per ticket for special access to the exhibitions ''Manet/Velazquez: The French Taste for Spanish Painting'' and ''El Greco.'' In the 1970s and 1980s it sometimes instituted ticket charges above the regular admission price for some shows, like King Tut in 1978 and for the work of Degas and Georgia O'Keeffe in 1988."

2011-06-03T17:37:17Z,"Whether you’re simply organized or mildy compulsive, a list can provide the structure for the everyday. However, when the to-do list is compiled by such artistic luminaries as Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder and Franz Kline, it transcends its ostensible purpose and provides insights into the life and times of its maker. This is obvious from a new show — “To-dos, Ilustrated Inventories, Collected Thoughts, and Other Artists’ Enumerations,” curated by Liza Kirwin from the Smithsonian’s Archives of American Art — that opened today at the Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan. For example, Pablo Picasso’s recommendations for inclusion in the 1913 Armory Show, the first international exhibition of modern art in the United States, astutely foresaw the historical importance of Marcel Duchamp, Fernand Leger and Juan Gris. Franz Kline’s shopping list for booze for his 1960 New Year’s party was evidence of his financial success (it was a hefty bill for the time) as well as his social nature. The artist Adolf Konrad illustrated his 1962 packing list: Khaki trench. Check. Six pairs of socks. Check. Sunglasses. Check. Two lemons. Check. Ah, the beauty of the artfully organized."

We at The Mount Sinai Medical Center are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend and longtime colleague, Rosalyn Yalow, PhD, Distinguished Service Professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and recipient of the 1977 Nobel Prize. She was the second woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Dr. Yalow was the first physics major at Hunter College and later became the sole woman at the University of Illinois College of Engineering, earning both her master's and PhD degrees there. She was an investigator at the Radioisotope Unit at the Bronx VA Hospital, a Mount Sinai affiliate, from 1947 until 1980, and she served as Senior Medical Investigator there starting in 1972. In 1968, she was also appointed Research Professor in the Department of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital and later she became the Solomon Berson Distinguished Professor at Large, a position she held until her death. Together with Solomon Berson, MD, who was also an outstanding clinician-scientist at Mount Sinai, Dr. Yalow postulated the presence of, and went on to demonstrate, insulin-binding antibodies in insulin-treated patients. The collaborators then revolutionized medical science, especially endocrinology and metabolism, by developing the radioimmunoassay in 1959, first of insulin and later of growth hormone, ACTH, parathormone, and gastrin. It is this body of work that led to the Nobel Prize. Dr. Berson died in 1972. During her distinguished career, Dr. Yalow also received many other honors, including the AMA Scientific Achievement Award, the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, and the National Medal of Science.

In an interview at the Royal Geographic Society on Tuesday, Mr. Naipaul, 78, derided Jane Austen, saying he ''couldn't possibly share her sentimental ambitions, her sentimental sense of the world,'' according to the Guardian. The reason was that ''inevitably for a woman, she is not a complete master of a house, so that comes over in her writing too.''

The change takes effect July 1. -The move, said Thomas P. Campbell, the museum's director, was made because income from the Met's $2.3 billion endowment has flattened as the economy has continued to sputter and because the average amount paid by visitors - who can decide to contribute as little as a penny if they want - has been lower recently.

Might it be that the unemployment rate is the ''wrong'' variable? It has a couple of flaws. It tends to be more a lagging than a leading indicator. It affects a relatively small number of voters (although underemployment is another matter). There is ample room to critique the way that it is calculated, such as by excluding ''discouraged workers'' from the calculation, and it's subject to reasonably large measurement errors."

Facing audience and critical rebellion over the last two “X-Men” installments, Tom Rothman, co-chairman of 20th Century Fox, took creative risks with “First Class” that appeared to pay off, including casting a cadre of untested young actors and approving a screenplay that includes Russian, French, German and Spanish dialogue — highly unusual for a summer blockbuster. In partial release overseas, the film took in an additional $64 million. “The Hangover Part II,” the raunchy buddy comedy from Warner Brothers, was second with an estimated $32.4 million for a two-week total of $187 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticketing statistics. “Kung Fu Panda 2” (DreamWorks Animation via Paramount) was third with about $24.3 million, sending its two-week total past $100 million. “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides” showed continued life in fourth place, taking in about $18 million for a three-week total of $190.3 million. The crude comedy “Bridesmaids” (Universal) was fifth with about $12 million for a four-week total of $107.3 million."

But any loss of momentum in the world economy poses a danger to Europe and the United States, where jobs, not prices, are the main concern.

Maite was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 and died in New York, NY on June 4. She was 42 years old. We will miss her very much. Her husband, Nick Rudenstine, and her beautiful daughters, Ines and Aurelia, will always be members of our family. Maite spent her entire career at Sullivan & Cromwell, beginning as a summer associate in 1993 and joining the firm as a first year associate in 1994 following her graduation from New York University School of Law. She was elected to the partnership in the Fall of 2002. A leading member of our litigation group, she built a remarkable career, spanning from complex disputes involving antitrust claims to bet-the-company intellectual property trials. In the wake of the recent financial crisis, Maite, a recognized star in securities litigation, carved a unique practice representing international financial institutions facing global scrutiny before the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the Financial Services Authority and the United States Congress. Maite's ability to see the big-picture and navigate through complex, interlocking investigations, regulatory proceedings and related civil litigation led to superlatives from dedicated clients who described her in industry review publications as a ""terrific, tireless lawyer who gets right to the heart of an issue"" with her ""excellent instincts and persuasive arguments."" Maite also devoted thousands of hours to pro bono service to persons in need, receiving a Thurgood Marshall Award for her substantial contributions of time and legal expertise. We are blessed to have shared the past eighteen years with Maite. A consummate lawyer, to us, she has been so very much more. A loyal and giving friend, a trailblazer, a touchstone, a role model and a mentor, she endowed us with her style, her grace, her compassion and her wit. We share our profound loss with the many and diverse communities that loved and respected her."

When he started in the mid-1970s in Brooklyn's Red Hook projects, his camera led him to what would become a remarkable chronicle of the early years of hip-hop style, complete with swaggering B-boys rocking shell-toe Adidas sneakers, fuzzy Kangol caps and thick black Cazal eyeglasses. Many of those iconic images are included in ''Back in the Days Remix,'' the 10th anniversary edition of the book that earned him widespread notice. ''It started for fun, but progressed into making people feel good about themselves,'' Mr. Shabazz said of his portraiture. ''I'd approach them and say 'Excuse me, brother. My name is Jamel Shabazz and I'm a photographer. When I see you, I see greatness. I see the future.'

2011-06-05T00:00:00Z,"AQUINO--Maite, 42, of Manhattan and Quogue, New York, at home on June 4, 2011, of complications after a long and brave fight against breast cancer. She will be missed profoundly by all who were fortunate enough to share her life. Survived by her devoted husband, Nicholas Rudenstine; her two beautiful and cherished girls, Ines and Aurelia; her beloved parents, Armando and Raquel Aquino; her loving sister Theresa Aquino and brother-in-law Joshua Ballinger; and many aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, friends and colleagues. Brought up amid a large, extended family on Staten Island, Maite graduated from SUNY Binghamton in 1991 before receiving her law degree from New York University School of Law in 1994. Following graduation from law school, Maite joined Sullivan & Cromwell, and was elected to the partnership in 2002 and became a partner of the firm on January 1, 2003. Maite was a member of the firm's litigation group, where she played a leading role in representing many of the firm's financial institution clients. She was an accomplished and gifted lawyer, recognized as a leading practitioner in her field, and was involved in many of the most significant corporate and securities cases of the past 15 years. Although Maite's personal and professional accomplishments were always impressive, her greatest impact on those around her came from her personal qualities. She was deeply devoted to her family and her friends and she brought to those relationships a unique combination of qualities-gentle, strong, determined, and loving. She was graceful and elegant but always relaxed and approachable. She wore her beauty easily, a beauty that was present to her last day, and she had a keen intellect, an unusually generous heart, and a smile and laugh that attracted everyone. She read widely and traveled frequently but she was, at heart, a local New Yorker who loved her home town and her family around her. Maite's daughters Ines and Aurelia were the greatest joy of her life and she fought with fierce courage and tremendous grace for each and every day that she was blessed to be with them. There will be a private funeral service for family members. A memorial will be held in the near future, details to be announced. In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that donations be made to breast cancer research that is relevant to the cause of Maite's death, and details on those programs will also be released shortly."

2011-06-05T00:00:00Z,"PRIVITERE--Louis Philip, 85, passed away peacefully at home on May 22, 2011 after a brief, valiant battle with lung cancer. He was a loving and devoted husband, father, grandfather and loyal friend and believed in living life to the fullest with no regrets. Born August 12, 1925, in New York, NY he enlisted in the US Army before he turned eighteen in 1943. He proudly served his country until 1946 in China-Burma-India during WWII. On returning to New York, he enrolled in NYU and studied Business Administration there before transferring to The University of Miami where he earned his degree in Economics. Lou (as he liked to be called by everyone) held executive positions with several pharmaceutical firms but it would be at Merck Sharp & Dohme International where he was hired in 1964 as managing director of Venezuela that he would make his mark during a twenty five year career. In 1967 he was transferred to Italy as managing director there. Merck's business was in an early stage and thanks to his leadership and energy together with the efforts of his successors a pattern of long term growth began with Italy becoming one of the biggest and most successful subsidiaries. He returned to the US in 1969 as vice president of Latin America and assumed broader responsibilities as vice president for the Western Hemisphere in 1974. In 1977 he was elected senior vice president responsible for the division's activities in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the far East (excluding Japan) the Middle East, India, Pakistan and Latin America. Before retiring in 1995, he was named senior vice president of Europe, thus completing many years at senior levels in a period of significant innovation and growth with the firm. Lou was a dynamic and resourceful executive whose greatest strengths were rooted in his ability to motivate and develop employees. He had a good eye for people's potential and was unafraid to delegate and empower his staff. Affable and direct, unceremonious in style, he was able to inspire his organizations to give their best. Happily retired in Naples, FL for the past sixteen years, he enjoyed cooking and playing golf, tennis and poker with his small circle of friends. In addition to his devoted wife, Jacqui, left to cherish his memory are his children, Paula Verner of Naples, FL, Andrea (Edward) Evans and Philip Privitere both of Montclair, NJ, his six grandchildren, David Verner, Todd Berquist, Chris Langfield, Tom Evans, Cayla and Cole Privitere and his stepson Alex O'Neal Caffrey.

2011-06-05T00:00:00Z,"AFTER ''Blonde Venus'' flopped in 1932, Paramount decided to break up the powerful creative alliance between the director Josef von Sternberg and the actress Marlene Dietrich, whom he had discovered in Germany and brought to Hollywood. While Sternberg, who was Jewish, entertained bizarre fantasies of returning to Germany to work for the state-controlled studio Ufa (he thought the Germans would treat him as the great artist he was), Dietrich was hustled directly into ''The Song of Songs,'' which has recently surfaced as half of a ''Pre-Code Double Feature'' available exclusively through the TCM Web site. (The other film is ''This Is the Night.'') Dietrich was still a valuable property, and the studio was probably trying to do its best by her by assigning ''The Song of Songs'' (1933) to Rouben Mamoulian, a prominent Broadway director who occasionally condescended to make moving pictures. The results are pretty appalling, but the film remains an instructive illustration of the culture war that then existed between the principled intellectuals of New York and the rampaging lowbrows of Los Angeles. Though the New Yorkers were triumphant at the time, history has largely reversed that judgment."

He was passionate about his family, science, art, cooking, heritage plants, old movies and so much more. His intelligence, entrepreneurial spirit and wonderful sense of humor will be deeply missed. Born in New York, he received his BSc from NYU (1970), and his PhD from the State University of New York (1977). He held faculty positions at NYU School of Medicine and The Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. In 1993, he became the Annenberg Professor of Molecular Biology and Neuroscience, the Vice-Chairman for Research in the Department of Neurology, and the Scientific Director of The Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for Multiple Sclerosis of The Mount Sinai School of Medicine. In September 2002, Dave moved with his family to Montreal to become Director of The Neuro, one of five institutions supported by the Killam Trusts. He was deeply committed to Wilder Penfield's original vision of an integrated research and clinical institution. Through his championship of The Neuro and all the people who work there, he drew people in, captivating them with the promise of a new neuroscience. Under his visionary leadership, The Neuro launched a $40-million campaign and was named one of the first Canadian Centres of Excellence in Research and Commercialization. Dave approached science with a strong conviction in basic, curiosity-driven research and he believed in approaching problems from every angle. This commitment led to the multidisciplinary Neuroengineering Program, an innovative Neuropalliative Care program, and a major expansion in brain imaging. Dave was a mentor to many. He encouraged young students to be curious about the world around them. He championed the Integrated Program in Neuroscience and was spearheading a collaborative project with the NFB of Canada to create an educational 3-D IMAX film about neuroscience. He was a world-renowned scientist, who focused on problems related to myelination, spinal cord injury and nerve cell development and regeneration. His laboratory made major contributions to our understanding of how nerves are protected and nurtured by the myelin sheath in the brain and in the peripheral nervous system, and how nerve cells communicate with each other across the synapse. He was on the editorial boards of Neuron and Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience, and a member of the Medical Advisory Committee for the Gairdner Foundation, and authored more than 110 scientific publications in top tier journals. Dave had a meaningful impact on all who had the fortune of knowing him and his legacy as a visionary leader and an extraordinary person will live on forever. A private funeral will take place in New York. A memorial tribute will be held in Montreal at a future date. In lieu of flowers or gifts, please send donations to the David Colman Memorial Fund, Montreal Neurological Institute, 3801 University St., Montreal, Quebec, Canada, H3A 2B4."

But what about Gary Carter's No. 8? The Mets have had a complicated relationship with Carter, who managed successfully in their low minors in 2005 and 2006, then quit when he was offered the job at Class AA Binghamton, only one step up the organizational ladder. Then, in 2008, Carter contacted the Mets about their major league job before Willie Randolph was fired."

At 94, Emmanuel Maynard Gertler, devoted husband, father of five, scholar and university teacher, publisher, farmer, defender of Canadian unity, public servant, civil libertarian, peace and human rights advocate, environmentalist, and athlete, passed away in Montreal on April 19, 2011. He leaves behind his saddened and proud family: his wife of 68 years, Ann Straus Gertler (a granddaughter of Nathan Straus, philanthropist, public servant and merchant, who was co-owner of R.H. Macy & Company, and of the Abraham and Straus department store -- and grandniece of famed New York photographer and advocate of modern art, Alfred Stieglitz), his sons Michael, Alfred, Franklin, Edward, and their spouses, nine grandchildren, one great-grandson and many beloved nieces, nephews, cousins and friends.

Maynard was Research Director and then President of the New York documentary film company, The World Today, and taught economics at NYU. He served in the U.S. Army and in several wartime intelligence and economic warfare agencies under the Roosevelt Administration. Maynard and Ann were owner-operators of farms in Little Washington, VA, and Lancaster County, PA. Later, in the mid-1950s, he taught American government and economic history at Cambridge University, England. Returning to his home city of Montreal in 1958, with Ann he founded and ran Harvest House Publishers for nearly 40 years, bringing out books that celebrated thinkers such as Thoreau, Zola, Marcuse, and Myrdal, blazed new trails in planning and environmental conservation, built bridges of understanding between Canada's many peoples and debunked racial myths and narrow readings of history. At the same time, the family pursued pure seed production on farms in Picton and Williamstown, Ontario. He served as president of Amnesty International Canada, as vice-president of PEN Canada; and as a board member of the Raoul Wallenberg International Movement for Humanity.

I had just been handed my daughter after being released from La Vista women's prison after a year for meth possession. I was getting out with nothing. I didn't have anywhere to live, I didn't have a job and she didn't really know me as her mom. That was scary. I knew that every choice I was going to make from then on would affect her, and I just wasn't prepared for it. But I've gotten everything pretty much straightened out since then. We have our own place, and I work full time as a waitress. I change her diapers, I stay up all night when she's fussy and I bathe her. At some point, I'm going to have to tell her that I've made mistakes, and I don't quite know how I'll go about having that conversation yet.

Nobody at La Grande Boucherie des Cajuns -- an annual festival in St. Martinville, La., celebrating the Cajun tradition of boucherie, or the communal butchering of hogs -- knew what had set him off. It might have been the thunderstorm that had hit town that morning, blowing tents from the festival grounds and drenching vendors. Or maybe it was the unseasonably cool air; a cold chopping block could make for unpleasant butchering. Whatever it was, he had packed up his apron and butchering tackle, locked the hog in the trailer, and sped off -- presumably to the hog's relief. We stuck around for a while, hoping he might change his mind and return. My girlfriend, Emily, even got him on the phone, explaining how we'd traveled all the way from New York, so wouldn't he come back and, please, slaughter a hog? He did not accede. If we wanted to see a hog killing so badly, he said, we could come to his house the next day and he'd do one special, just for us."

(Showtime 2) LETTERS TO JULIET (2010) Sophie, a magazine fact checker played by Amanda Seyfried, arrives in Verona, Italy, on a prenuptial honeymoon of sorts with her restaurateur fiancé, Victor (Gael García Bernal, above with Ms. Seyfried). Then they go their separate ways. He hunts down culinary delicacies. She happens upon a group of Italian women known as Juliet's secretaries, who gather letters written by lovelorn ladies tucked between the stones of a wall beneath the most famous balcony in Verona. One day Sophie happens upon a note written decades earlier by Claire (Vanessa Redgrave), a British exchange student who ran back to England with cold feet after breaking her promise to meet a local beau. Soon, lured by Sophie's response, Claire returns to Verona with her romance-averse grandson, Charlie (Christopher Egan), whose immediate dislike of Sophie could well spell love. The film ''represents an interesting paradox: It is a movie that is very nearly perfect without being especially good,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Still, he praised Ms. Redgrave's Claire as ''effortlessly marvelous,'' adding that she ''imparts grace, authenticity and a sense of emotional gravity to a movie desperate for all of those things and unsure just how to manufacture them.'' Of Ms. Seyfried, he wrote that the movie ''is likely to consolidate her position as a certified movie star.'' 9:20 A.M.

2011-06-06T00:00:00Z,"One of the year's best-reviewed wide-release movies, ''X-Men: First Class,'' took in a solid $56 million at the North American box office over the weekend - easily enough for No. 1 and to help reboot a sagging franchise. Facing audience and critical rebellion over the last two ''X-Men'' installments, Tom Rothman, co-chairman of 20th Century Fox, took creative risks with ''First Class'' that appeared to pay off, including casting a cadre of untested young actors and approving a screenplay that includes Russian, French, German and Spanish dialogue - highly unusual for a summer blockbuster. In partial release overseas, the film took in an additional $64 million. ''The Hangover Part II,'' the raunchy buddy comedy from Warner Brothers, was second with an estimated $32.4 million for a two-week total of $187 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticketing statistics. ''Kung Fu Panda 2'' (DreamWorks Animation via Paramount) was third with about $24.3 million, sending its two-week total past $100 million. ''Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides'' showed continued life in fourth place, taking in about $18 million for a three-week total of $190.3 million. The crude comedy ''Bridesmaids'' (Universal) was fifth with about $12 million for a four-week total of $107.3 million. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

His point, at least as I understood it, was that most politicians are raging narcissists of one stripe or another, walking a tightrope between flagrant egotism and true pathology. But public figures who pass through the fire of a major scandal-driven humiliation have a rare chance to come to terms with that narcissism’s catastrophic consequences, and as a result many of them probably come out of these kind of self-inflicted disasters as better people — and perhaps, by implication, better public servants — than your typical Joe Q.

The makeup artist Lottie Stannard applied M.A.C. Coffee Eyeliner “haphazardly” — topped off with loads of black mascara — and M.A.C. Blush Cream in Laid Back. “I’m really into a blush on the eyelid and on the high of the cheek,” Sevigny said. “The singer of Cocteau Twins used to do that — really pink eyelids.

(No, not the Rolling Stones, the other guys.) A statement from Live Nation said Mr. McCartney’s performance at Yankee Stadium “can safely be predicted to feature some nearly three hours of the world’s best loved and most known music, with hits, deep cuts and surprises spanning his unrivaled career,” including the 2008 album “Electric Arguments” that he released under the name the Fireman.

2011-06-08T00:00:00Z,"SABSHIN--Melvin, M.D. The American Psychiatric Association has marked the passing of one of the most prominent psychiatrists in the second half of the 20th Century, Melvin Sabshin, M.D. Dr. Sabshin led the APA for nearly a quarter century from 1974 to 1997. He passed away on Saturday at the age of 85. Sabshin's accomplishments during his tenure at APA were numerous and far-reaching. His years at APA included publication of new editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; creation of the American Psychiatric Press, Inc.; the development of practice guidelines; and the strengthening of research, advocacy, education, and public affairs. Sabshin also increased the organization's international involvement by working with the World Psychiatric Association and others to help end the use of psychiatry to suppress political dissent in the Soviet Union and other parts of the world. ""Dr. Sabshin was an esteemed leader, an intellectual catalyst, and a consummate diplomat who was central to the evolution of modern American psychiatry,"" said APA President John M. Oldham, M.D. ""As medical director of the American Psychiatric Association from 1974 to 1997, Dr. Sabshin understood that psychiatry, as a profession, needed a new direction, resolved to be part of the change, and succeeded."" Sabshin completed high school at age 14 and undergraduate study at the age of 17. After brief service in the U.S. Army, he completed medical school and residency at Tulane University. He then took a position at the Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago and in 1961 became the head of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Illinois College Medicine. During this time, he became active in the APA and was elected to the Board of Trustees; and in 1974 he became the medical director of the APA. Upon his retirement from APA, he took a position as clinical professor of psychiatry with the University of Maryland and lived much of the year in London with his British wife, where he was an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. He remained active in the APA, attending Annual Meetings throughout his retirement. Sabshin was an author of dozens of scientific articles and author or co-author of seven books, including his latest in 2008, Changing American Psychiatry: a Personal Perspective, in which he describes changes in psychiatry in the post WWII era and later and offers his insights into the process. Dr. Sabshin is survived by his wife, Marion Bennathan, his son, James Sabshin, M.D., and four granddaughters."

2011-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Memorable dishes sometimes come out of nowhere. One recent evening in Tarragona, just south of Barcelona, I wandered past a number of cafes and tapas bars. Txantxangorri, a Basque place serving rice dishes -- not paellas -- was the only one that had seats. The rice with rabbit, served in a terra cotta casserole, was simple, satisfying and, unlike the Michelin-starred dishes I had elsewhere in Spain, something I could try at home. With reds from Roussillon, a region that is practically in Catalonia anyway, I had my chance. If you do not have an earthenware casserole, you can make the whole thing, from stovetop to oven, in enameled cast iron. FLORENCE FABRICANT"

Edstrand now splits her time between Paris and Jaipur, India, where she moved six years ago and where her one-year-old line is produced by traditional craftsmen. “The embroidery that’s done here is unbelievable,” Edstrand says. “When I showed one of my pieces to Manish Arora” — the New Delhi designer who’s known as the John Galliano of India — “he couldn’t believe it.

In its second week out the album sold 174,000 copies, an 84 percent drop, according to data from Nielsen SoundScan. Its strongest competition on the Billboard chart this week is Adele's ''21'' (XL), which sold 121,000 copies in its 15th week in stores, bringing the album's total sales past two million, the first title this year to cross that benchmark."

2011-06-09T00:00:00Z,"Greenpoint, at the northernmost tip of Brooklyn, accessible to Manhattan by subway transfer to the G train, can seem physically removed from the rest of the city. Maybe mentally removed, too - the waterfront neighborhood feels a bit apart from Manhattan's hustle. Even so, it might seem surprising that on Friday afternoon, when a package arrived at Dandelion Wine addressed to Dominique Strauss-Kahn, no one there had heard of him. Not the mailman, who asked ''Is there a Dominique here?'' Not the three workers in the store. One of them, Tom Athans, accepted the package anyway; he had a ex-girlfriend in France and thought it might be a practical joke. There is a an explanation of sorts for why the package arrived at the wine shop. It shares the same address - 153 Franklin Street - as the $14 million TriBeCa town house where Mr. Strauss-Kahn is confined while he faces charges that he sexually assaulted a hotel housekeeper."
2011-06-09T00:00:00Z,"I recently visited a business owner's facility. As our meeting ended, she turned to me and said, ''Wouldn't it be great if you could run a business without employees?'' There were no employees around. I smiled and gave the perfunctory head nod -- but it was a lying perfunctory head nod, if there is such a thing. I know that many people have commented on this very blog that they prefer, or would prefer, to run their businesses without employees. I don't feel that way, but let me state the obvious: employees can be a liability. Whether they are causing problems with customers, stealing, breaking things, suing you or doing something that gets you in trouble with a regulatory agency, employees can be trouble. And when trouble rears its ugly head, the owner cannot say, ''I was only taking orders!''"

2011-06-09T00:00:00Z,"SALNY--Alan S.,age 83, of West Palm Beach, Florida, formerly of Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts died on Sunday, June 5, 2011 while hospitalized in Florida. Mr. Salny was the son of the late Samuel M. Salny, the prominent New England labor attorney and labor relations specialist and his widow, Rae Salny Brown. Alan is survived by his loving family; June G.(Freedman) Salny, his wife of over 60 years, daughter Susan and her husband Dean Trilling, son Stephen, two grandsons, Scott and his wife Meghan Trilling and Andrew Trilling and great-grandchildren, Elsie Rose and Adam Trilling. Mr. Salny was born in Boston and raised in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. He graduated from Worcester Academy in 1945 at the age of 17 and attended Williams College until his studies were interrupted by his service in the Military Intelligence Division of General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo. After his honorable discharge from the army, Mr. Salny completed his studies at Boston University where, in succession to his father, he was a second-generation member of Tau Epsilon Phi. He graduated from BU in 1951. Mr. Salny was President of the Alan Salny Real Estate Company which manages the residential real estate portfolio developed in Baltimore, Maryland during the 1940s and the 1950s by his father. Mr. Salny has overseen the business collaboratively with his son since 1977. Alan Salny served on the Board of Directors of the Perfect Film and Chemical Corporation, a public company under the aegis of Martin S. Ackerman, the financier and President and Chairman of the Board of that company which was engaged in film processing and the mail-order sales of drugs and vitamins through United Whelan Corporation, a drugstore chain; Hudson National Inc., a mail-order firm; and Equality Plastics Inc., a consumer-products-distribution company. Mr. Salny was active with Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston (CJP), serving as Advance Gifts chairman for the organization's 1967 Newton, Massachusetts Appeal and Israel Emergency Fund. He also chaired CJP's Newton Appeal and Israel Emergency Fund campaigns in 1968 and 1969 and was appreciably involved with the organization's longstanding Real Estate Team and Business Men's Council. An avid tennis player who won many interclub tournaments, Mr. Salny played the game all-year-round in Florida, in Boston and also in the Negev during his and his wife's first visit to Israel in 1966, less than one year before the Six-Day War. He and his wife even attended Wimbledon on their honeymoon in 1950. Mr. Salny was also an enthusiast of sports (he held season's tickets to the Baltimore Orioles for over 50 years), politics, travel and jazz and classical music, especially the performances of the Boston Pops, Tanglewood and the by-gone Palm Beach Festival. Services will be held at the Levine Chapels, 470 Harvard St., Brookline, MA on Sunday, June 12 at 11am. Burial will follow at Sharon Memorial Park in Sharon, MA. Memorial observance at his late residence following the burial on Sunday until 8pm and Monday and Tuesday 1-4pm and 7-9pm.

2011-06-09T00:00:00Z,"NO one knows who designed the iconic sunglasses Audrey Hepburn wore in ''Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' Speculated to be any one of a number of brands, they were most likely provided by the venerable British eyewear company Oliver Goldsmith, which made all the frames the actress wore in ''Charade,'' ''How to Steal a Million,'' ''Roman Holiday'' and ''Two for the Road.'' The company, which dates from 1926, was brought back to life in 2005 (it closed in 1985) by Mr. Goldsmith's great-granddaughter, Claire Goldsmith, who has now created a replica of the oversize Holly Golightly frames to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the film. She called upon craftsmen who worked with the company for generations and studied 40 stills to recreate the shape. (An original drawing never turned up.) Ms. Goldsmith likes to recall a passage from her grandfather's memoirs: ''He said: 'Today I met a delightful young lady called Audrey Hepburn. They tell me she is going to be a big star.'

2011-06-09T00:00:00Z,"I remember the day I reached my limit with the retail coffee and espresso business that my husband and I started in 2003. When we started our little food service venture, it was supposed to be a fun project that would eventually run itself and act as an additional source of income for our household. But after three years, two locations and countless hours, it became evident that our plan was easier said than done. I had felt the day coming. There are some things you just know about your business. We were fast asleep one cold, February morning in 2005 when Chris's cellphone rang at 4:15. It was the lead barista at our north location calling to say she wouldn't be able to work her shift. That gave one of us 15 minutes to jump out of bed, get dressed and fly into Bentonville, Ark., to open our flagship store in time for the morning rush. This was not the first time this had happened, but it ended up being a wake-up call in more ways than one. In my business-owner bones, I knew things had to change. I also knew that there was something fundamentally wrong with my business: me."

2011-06-09T00:00:00Z,"Our case study last week examined the efforts of a bicycle shop owner in Princeton, N.J., to secure a loan. Charles Kuhn, who runs Kopp's Cycle, had sought $1 million to refinance the mortgage on the shop, pay down debt, and obtain working capital. Unfortunately for Mr. Kuhn, the recession has hurt both his business and, apparently, the value of his real estate, undermining its potential as loan collateral. But the lenders and other advisers we consulted suggested that Mr. Kuhn's inability to get a loan has more to do with how he has managed his business than the economic climate or the reluctance of bankers to make loans. ''The first impression is we are trying to treat the symptom and not the cause,'' said Lorraine Allen, regional director of the Small Business Development Center at the College of New Jersey in nearby Ewing. ''If the banks tell us we have a problem with cash flow, we have to trace through the lines of operation to see where the challenges are and address them, and not just for the sake of the loan.''

Would you be interested in attending an hour-and-a-half lecture by Terry Gene Bollea, a seasoned actor, musician and athlete? Not sure? How about a 90-minute, no-holds-barred stage production starring Hulk Hogan, the pointing, preening, all-American professional wrestler? Whichever sounds more appealing, you'll have your chance to pose questions to and receive wisdom from Mr. Hogan, the body-slamming alter ego of Mr. Bollea, on a tour that the wrestler is planning for next year and which his agency is envisioning as a Hulk-ified version of ''Inside the Actors Studio'' (with perhaps more Atomic Leg Drops than James Lipton's incarnation). The Agency Group said on Wednesday that it had signed up Mr. Hogan for the production, called ''In Conversation: Outside the Ring with Hulk Hogan,'' which will start with a few dates in the fall before commencing a worldwide tour next year. Nick Meinema of the Agency Group said Wednesday that the specific contents of the stage show were still being worked out, but would likely include ''about an hour of semi-scripted stories and behind-the-scenes stuff, synced up with video and pictures, stuff that he wants to share with his fans and will be exciting for them to hear from him -- personal stories, stories about matches and his career.'' The presentation will then conclude with a Q. and A. where audience members can ask the Hulkster about his life and work. But can they ask him to demonstrate the big boot on them? ''I doubt that highly, for insurance reasons,'' Mr. Meinema said. ''But maybe he can tell a story about how that finishing move came about.''"

2011-06-09T00:00:00Z,"CHU--Jeffrey Chuan, beloved husband of Loretta Yung Chu, passed away at his home in Lincoln, MA on June 6, 2011, at the age of 91. Known as Chuan to family and friends, he was born into a family of scholars in Tienjin, China. He received his BS from the University of Minnesota and his MS from the Moore School at the University of Pennsylvania. Chuan was a core member of the engineering team that designed the first electronic computer, ENIAC, in 1946. As a Senior Scientist at Argonne National Laboratory, he helped design several improved versions of large-scale computers, until the 1950's when he became Chief Engineer at Univac for the LARC project, one of the earliest all-transistor computers. He continued to be a leading figure in the computer and electronics industry as microchip technology allowed computing devices to become smaller and more personal, becoming Director of Engineering and Vice President of Honeywell Information Systems, Senior Vice President at Wang Laboratories, and Chairman and CEO of Sanders Technology (Santec). He also served as Senior Advisor at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) and at Data Resources, Inc. (DRI). Most recently, he held the position of Senior Advisor and was a member of the Board at BTU International. In the 1970's, Chuan returned to China for the first time in nearly 40 years and discovered the cause that would become his passionate mission for the rest of his life. He became an active participant in the effort to modernize China. Meeting with Deng Xiao Ping and serving on various State boards, he brought his technological expertise and knowledge of Western business practices to China, and advised American companies seeking to do business in China. As a lifelong scholar himself, it was his greatest pleasure to serve as visiting professor at several universities in China. He personally established a scholarship for Chinese students to study English at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and he facilitated the establishment of a partnership between Jiao Tong University and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Inspired by his years of living in the U.S., Chuan promoted the idea of public service as being an essential ingredient of a successful modern society. It was his self-appointed mission to inspire individuals to help those less fortunate, and to serve a cause beyond themselves. He advocated this ideal in his many public speeches in China, and he established a Campus Civility Award for public service at Jiao Tong University. However, he taught best by his own example. A man of tremendous vigor and vision, he spent his long public life in service to both his countries. Chuan is survived by his wife Loretta of Lincoln, MA; his brother Zhu Chuan-yi of Beijing, China; his sister Zhu Chuan-yi of Tianjin, China; his daughter Lynnet and husband Noel McDermott of Santa Cruz, CA; daughter Bambi and husband Michael Rae of Naples, Italy; daughter Diedre and husband Fanul (Bodhi) Kocica of Miami Beach, FL; and stepson Van Tsai and his wife Paula of Hanover, NH. He leaves eight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. He was predeceased by four sisters, Zhu Tao-le, Zhu Shang-rou, Zhu Chuan-xun, and Zhu Chuan-rong, and by his granddaughter Lauren Tsai. A celebration of Chuan's life will be held on Saturday, July 16, 11:00am, at the First Parish Church in Weston, MA. Interment at Woodlawn Cemetery in NY is private.

Was the night-shrouded ''Drug Store'' modeled from the Waverly Place shop in Greenwich Village currently occupied by a corner bookstore? The artist offered them little help. ''What I wanted to do was to paint sunlight on the side of a house,'' was his typically terse clue about his work. City searchers would be wise to go 20 miles up the Hudson River to Nyack, a rustic backwater when Hopper grew up there in the 1880s. His home on North Broadway has been preserved as the Edward Hopper House Art Center."

That will change on June 23 at a gala celebrating the acclaimed career of Diana Vishneva at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Janet Eilber, artistic director of the Martha Graham Company, said Wednesday. Ms. Vishneva, a 34-year-old prima ballerina with both Mariinsky (formerly the Kirov Ballet) and American Ballet Theater, will perform ''Errand Into the Maze'' with Benjamin Robert Schultz, a member of the Graham company. Created in 1947, ''Maze'' is one of the 13 Graham masterpieces based on ancient Greek myths. ''It's kind of astounding because we've been everywhere else in the world,'' Ms. Eilber said of the performance. ''We're really excited.

2011-06-10T00:00:00Z,"DIETZ--David. A career journalist who found his calling in public service investigative reporting, died June 1 in his home in Healdsburg, CA. He was 70. The cause was cancer. Mr. Dietz was a senior writer for Bloomberg Markets magazine and had been part of the Bloomberg News operation since 2001. His last in-depth story for the magazine, in March, revealed ways in which some corporations have cheated the public by taking federal tax credits intended to reduce poverty and using them instead for development of luxury hotels and office buildings. His follow-up article in April reported that the U.S. Treasury Department has pledged to reform the program. Mr. Dietz's career spanned more than four decades and included long stints at two San Francisco newspapers, the Examiner, where he met his wife of 24 years, journalist Joanne Derbort, and the Chronicle, where he was special-projects editor for investigative reporting. Before joining Bloomberg, he wrote and edited at TheStreet.com. A past board president of Investigative Reporters and Editors, an international organization of 4,600 journalists, Mr. Dietz received the IRE's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010. His probes into civic malfeasance, judicial misconduct and corporate fraud won more than 25 national and regional awards, changed laws and reformed public policy. David Stanley Dietz was born April 30, 1941 in Syracuse, NY, grew up in New York City and Westfield, NJ and studied history at Rider University. His affinity for journalism began with visits as a child to the Newark Star Ledger, where his father, Joe Dietz, worked. He landed early reporting jobs at the Asbury Park Press and the Jersey Journal, then moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1960s, first working as a reporter and city editor at the Marin Independent-Journal. During his newspaper career, he completed a journalism fellowship at the University of Missouri. Mr. Dietz is survived by Ms. Derbort of Healdsburg, CA, two sons, Robert of San Jose, CA, and William of Tahoe City, CA, and their wives; four grandchildren, and a sister, Debby Dietz Davis, of the Hudson Valley in New York. Services will be private.

Mr. McCartney, the pop musician whose work in Wings is perennially overshadowed by his time with another popular British rock outfit, has some familiarity with New York ballparks, having served as the inaugural performer at Citi Field as in 2009, and as a surprise guest when Billy Joel closed down Shea Stadium in 2008; Mr. McCartney also played at Shea Stadium in 1965 as part of that beloved band whose name momentarily escapes us. (No, not the Rolling Stones, the other guys.) A statement from Live Nation said Mr. McCartney's performance at Yankee Stadium ''can safely be predicted to feature some nearly three hours of the world's best loved and most known music, with hits, deep cuts and surprises spanning his unrivaled career,'' including the 2008 album ''Electric Arguments'' that he released under the name the Fireman.

But both are getting on in age (Rodriguez is 39 and Vizquel is 44) and their trajectories as hitters do not say much for their chances (neither is on a pace for 60 hits in 2011). Even for a great hitter like Ichiro Suzuki, the trends are pointing down. He ranks 11th among active players, but he is 37, needs 690 hits to reach 3,000 and has fallen off this season."

The young man is Dave Stutler (Jay Baruchel, above left, with Mr. Cage), a physics major at New York University who tinkers with a giant Tesla coil in a basement lab while yearning for his childhood crush (Teresa Palmer). The wizard, however, decides that Dave is the Prime Merlinian. That means that he's the only person who can save the world from Balthazar's arch nemesis, Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina), and the cataclysm that will be unleashed by the ancient spells of wizards, including the mean Morgana (Alice Krige) and the gorgeous Veronica (Monica Bellucci), if they are released from a Russian doll in which they were hidden centuries before. ''While Mr. Molina and Mr. Cage supply a measure of well-compensated eccentricity, their labors ultimately serve to emphasize the grinding mediocrity of the enterprise,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''Why would Balthazar and Maxim -- magicians who can fly, change shape and conjure force fields, fireballs and just about anything else they want -- need to climb into cars and chase each other through the streets of New York?

2011-06-11T00:00:00Z,"Beginning on Saturday the two manuscript parts of the unfinished and unpublished Jane Austen novel known as ''The Watsons'' will not be reunited, exactly, but will be closer they've been in almost 100 years -- just 35 blocks or so from each other. The first part of the manuscript, some 12 pages, was sold during World War I to benefit the Red Cross, and now belongs to the Morgan Library & Museum. The rest, 68 pages which had been in private hands in England until recently, is going on display for a week at Sotheby's before being shipped back to London, where it will be auctioned off in mid-July. One of very few surviving Austen manuscripts, ''The Watsons'' is interesting for being extensively revised and corrected in her tiny, precise handwriting -- evidence of Austen's painstaking writing habits. You can see, for example, that after accusing the arrogant Lord Osborne of ''carelessness'' and ''awkwardness,'' she went back and added ''coldness'' for good measure. Austen wrote ''The Watsons'' in 1804, a year before her father died and after the early versions of what eventually became ''Sense and Sensibility,'' ''Pride and Prejudice'' and ''Northanger Abbey.'' Why she abandoned it is not clear. It's by far the bleakest of her novels, however, and its story - of an impoverished young woman, with no marital prospects, whose sole friend is an ailing clergyman father - may have been uncomfortably close to the facts of Austen's own life just then."

But I can also imagine that Mr. Bedford's undertaking might have caused just a little bit of consternation in certain circles - namely among actresses who might regard a man assuming such a choice woman's role as an ungentlemanly bit of poaching. For while the Broadway season was a bountiful one in many ways - what's this, almost a dozen new musicals? - it was pretty thin on significant leading roles for women. For the first time in years the Tony nominators could find only four leading women in musicals they deemed worthy of notice.

2011-06-12T00:00:00Z,"After a long career as a designer, illus- trator and filmmaker, the French artist Charles Matton (who died at 77 in 2008) be- gan creating his mysterious boxes in 1985.''It all started because Charles wanted to make realistic paintings of interiors,'' said his widow, Sylvie Matton. But whenever he chose a space, ''the colors on the walls were not the right ones'' or ''he would have to wait hours for the sun to set,'' she said. To solve the problem Mr. Matton started building miniature rooms, which soon grew so richly detailed that he wanted to make them for their own sake. ''It was not like, 'Oh, I am going to do boxes,''' Ms. Matton said. ''It was a whole adventure of creation.''His subjects included the studios of art- ists like Francis Bacon and Giacometti, the empty halls of grand hotels and the librar-ies of Proust and Freud, for which he re- searched and modeled each individual book and bibelot. His longtime friend the philosopher Jean Baudrillard referred to the tiny atmosphere-packed environments as ''theatrum simulacrum.''Mirrors create the illusion of labyrin- thine corridors and make the interior of a box appear larger than its confines. In the library, above, with nine views, Mr. Matton amplified the confusion by introducing a ghostly figure -- a video projection -- who prowls the shelves without casting a shad- ow.''We love it when people try and under- stand'' how a box is made, Ms. Matton said, speaking as though her husband were still alive. ''But we also love it when they just accept the fact that it's there as a magic thing.''"

2011-06-12T00:00:00Z,"REDLICH--Norman, former Dean of the NYU School of Law from 1975 to 1988, and prominent constitutional lawyer, died yesterday at his home on Park Avenue. He is survived by his beloved wife of 60 years, Evelyn Grobow Redlich, by their three adoring children, Bonny, Carrie, and Edward, and by his five grandchildren, Mara and Joshua Revkin, Abigail Montopoli, and Noah and Zoe Timberman Redlich. After serving in the 100th Infantry Division in France during World War II, he attended Williams College and was later graduated first in his class at Yale Law School. After Yale, he worked in his family wholesale plumbing business, wrote on civil liberties and the law, and received a LL.M. in Taxation from NYU in 1955. He joined the NYU School of Law faculty in 1960, was promoted to full professor in 1962, and served as the director of the Law School's Project on Urban and Poverty Law until he became Associate Dean in 1974. He was named Dean in 1975 and served until 1988, during which time NYU became a prominent national Law School. He championed clinical legal education, and taught primarily in the area of Constitutional Law, Taxation, Urban Affairs, and Professional Responsibility. In 1963-64, he served as Assistant Counsel on the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy (the Warren Commission) He served for seven years in high positions in New York City's Law Department, and, in 1972, was named by Mayor John Lindsay as Corporation Counsel of the City of New York, the City's highest legal office. He was also active in the organized bar, having served as Chair of the American Bar Association's Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar. He was passionately devoted to many civil liberties and civil rights causes, was a member of the board, and of its executive committee, of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, and was Co-chair of the Commission on Law and Social Action of the American Jewish Congress. He was the only law professor to serve as a Co-chair of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and received that organization's highest award-The Whitney North Seymour Award-in 1993. He was Chair of Justice-PAC, a political action committee to support candidates for public office in New York State who oppose the death penalty. This represented a modern refrain of his earlier efforts in the same area; in 1959, as counsel to the New York Committee to Abolish Capital Punishment, he organized a group of the University's professors who were probably the first lawyers ever to litigate against the death penalty. He was on the Board of Trustees of The Vermont Law School, and after leaving NYU, he served as counsel to the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. He was a tireless defender of human rights who lived his life true to his favorite maxim, ""There is no limit to what you can accomplish in the world if you don't care who gets the credit."" And as he often laughingly added, ""Or the blame."" He loved Get Smart, Frank Sinatra, opera, cheesecake, and riding his tractor in Vermont. The gentleness of his spirit and the brilliance of his mind will be forever missed. Contributions in his honor may be made to The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Funeral Services will be on Monday, June 13, at 11:45am at the Riverside Memorial Chapel at 180 West 74th Street. The burial will be Tuesday, in Vermont at the cemetery of the Jewish Community of Greater Stowe. The family will sit Shiva on Sunday afternoon, June 12, Monday evening, June 13 Wednesday evening, June 15 and Thursday evening, June 16 at 480 Park Ave."

2011-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Elegance seemed to go viral in the photographs of George Hoyningen-Huene. A Russian emigre in Paris in the 1920s, and a baron at that, Huene produced an exquisite quality of longing - or was it remoteness? - in the pages of French Vogue, where he was chief photographer in the most glamorous of 20th-century decades. You might say that Huene (pronounced HEW-neh) sealed the deal between modern-thinking couturiers and photographers, seducing us with light and classical forms. Afterward, nothing seemed the same. In her review of a 2001 exhibition that brought together Huene and his great friend Horst, the critic Vicki Goldberg noted ''the two H's influenced almost everyone else.'' So I was intrigued by the pairing of Huene and the American photographer Kurt Markus in a new exhibition at the Staley-Wise Gallery in SoHo. Mr. Markus first came to my attention in the early '90s, when I bought one of his landscapes, a graceful, if somewhat desolate-looking tree marked by a country road. Around the same time, Mr. Markus did one of my favorite spreads to appear in the Times Magazine (with the stylist Polly Hamilton) called ''The Look of the '90s,'' in which a group of nonagenarians posed in mostly avant-garde designs. A native of Montana, drawn naturally to Western characters, Mr. Markus's fashion pictures have a rare quality of warmth and wit."
2011-06-12T00:00:00Z,"IF you're a woman who roared, snorted or sniggered at ''Bridesmaids,'' if you like watching other women on screen, you should see it again. Because that hit comedy written by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo and directed by Paul Feig, turns out to be one of the few occasions this summer when you can enjoy a movie about and with women released by a major studio. From now through August, American films will again be almost all male, almost all the time (the occasional decorative gal pal notwithstanding) as this year's boys of summer -- the Green Lantern and Captain America, Conan the Barbarian and Conan O'Brien -- invade the multiplex, seizing media-entertainment minds and your dollars. Mind you there are a few high-profile girls and women here and there, including the title character of ''Bad Teacher,'' with Cameron Diaz as the romance- and etiquette-challenged teacher who at one point washes a car in slow motion while wearing a midriff and hot pants. Evidently nothing says new motion picture entertainment better than a female movie star in Daisy Dukes bending over and sudsing a car as if she were in a 2005 Jessica Simpson music video."

2011-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Sebastião Salgado began working on ''Genesis,'' his most recent project, seven years ago. His idea was to photograph 20 places where the landscape was still pristine, relatively untouched by humans. He traveled to southern Africa and to the Amazon rain forests, to the South Sandwich Islands in the southern Atlantic and to Patagonia. The pictures in this portfolio document his journey to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska. A friend of his, who worked for the Unesco World Heritage Center, had spent a lot of time in Alaska and spoke to him often about the refuge. ''He gave me a book about it,'' Salgado says. ''For me, it became a big dream to go there.'' The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge covers more than 30,000 square miles from the coast of the Arctic Ocean across the Brooks Range mountains and into interior Alaska, covering several ecological zones that include barrier islands, coastal lagoons, salt marshes and rivers. Salgado visited the region in the spring and summer of 2009, when the caribou travel to the coastal plain to give birth and raise their young. He set up base camp in the village of Kaktovik and traveled by small plane, boat and on foot to capture the migrating herd."

David Feherty's half-interview, half-improv weekly show, ''Feherty,'' will make its debut at 9 p.m. Eastern on June 21 on the Golf Channel and run for 12 weeks. Feherty, 52, a native of Northern Ireland, became a professional golfer at 17, won five tournaments in Europe and three in South Africa, and represented Europe at the 1991 Ryder Cup. He joined CBS Sports full time as a golf commentator in 1997. As a host, Feherty will be a cross between Oprah Winfrey and Johnny Carson: at once confessional and a chameleon who inhabits characters like Dr. Phyll and Hamish McGregor, who was a central figure in Feherty's 2002 novel, ''A Nasty Bit of Rough.'' Feherty has been an open book over the years about his clinical depression and addictions to alcohol and painkillers.Q.How would you describe your new show? A.A televised nervous breakdown is the way it feels at the moment. I've been on TV for 15 years now, but it's never been anything I can be held completely responsible for. We're going to try various different things and see what the reaction is. Some of it will be serious. Some of it won't. There'll be an interview every week because I'm interested in other people's opinions. I just interviewedCharles Barkley, who was hysterical.Q.Is there anyone on TV you'd like to model yourself after?A.I'm a huge Billy Connolly fan, always have been. I like Ricky Gervais, Bob Newhart; people who are more observers. We've gotten to the stage today if you want comedy, you watch the news, and if you want news, you turn to the comedy channel. It's gotten turned upside down. Q.Whom do you like to win the United States Open next weekend?A.Steve Stricker has got to be one of the favorites.

He received his Bachelor's Degree from Manhattan College (1953), where he was a member of the college's legendary sprint relay team (1951-53). He also held numerous individual titles. In 1953, as a member of the United States track team, he won the 100 and 220-yard titles at the British Games. From 1953 to 1955, Joe served as first lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps as an air traffic controller and where he also exercised his passion for track. From 1963-1993 he taught physical education and coached track and field for Wappingers Central School District, and became known as the ""father of track and field"" in Duchess County. In 1991, he was inducted into the Manhattan College Athletic Hall of Fame, and in 2008 his former students and athletes dedicated a monument to their coach which is on the athletic field of R.C. Ketcham High School. As one former students stated, ""His positive influence ripples out today through leaders in community and country."" Joe was an unusual athlete in that he was deeply involved in the world of art and was himself and artful photographer. His ""studio"" on the Hudson River is filled with his photographs of the Hudson River Valley, a place dear to his heart, a place where he spent hours reading and writing poetry. Preceding him in death were his parents, his brother James and his son Peter.

2011-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Although Peter Feigenbaum, 27, grew up near Boston, he was always obsessed with New York -- particularly the ruined street- scapes he knew only from films made long be- fore his birth, like ''The French Connection'' and ''Serpico.'' While studying architecture as an undergraduate at Yale, he began making scale models of archetypical New York build- ings and photographing them in different com- binations. His concept for the project, ''Train- set Ghetto,'' he said, is that ''New York has a certain style of vernacular architecture and blocks often feel like they're interchangeable.''Although Mr. Feigenbaum has worked in different architecture firms since moving to New York five years ago, he has not changed his basic approach to building a row house. Al- though sometimes he makes a wooden mold and casts it in plaster, and other times he de- signs on a computer and has plastic parts cut in a shop, the trick is always in building up enough layers of tempera paint, along with plenty of wet brushing, dry brushing and air- brushing, to summon up the necessary patina of grime and decrepitude (left and above right). Sometimes he adds a dirtied model car to the scene to suggest a sign of life.These days, to make sure his project ''evolves away from a hobbyist aesthetic,'' Mr. Feigenbaum said, he often disassembles his models and photographs them outside, amid the real streets of New York. In the resulting pictures it's hard to tell where toy town ends and the full-scale buildings start. But that's the point.

BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Saleh was flown to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for medical treatment, along with dozens of other officials and relatives, leaving the vice president to manage in Sana, the Yemeni capital.

The World Series has not been tied 2-2 since 2003, when the Yankees played the Florida Marlins. Since then, three series have been sweeps, and a team has led three games to one four times. The series extended to six games only once in that time, in 2009. Competitive balance is not the problem; 11 teams have filled the 14 spots in those World Series."

2011-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Twenty years ago Didier Massard was a studio photographer in Paris who amused himself by shooting European landscapes in his spare time. Gradually he felt compelled to photo- graph more exotic locales, but only as they ex- isted in his mind.''There were many places in the world I wished to photograph and visit,'' Mr. Massard, 57, said, ''and I realized that they wouldn't be as I imagined them.'' Eventually he decided to build a scene in his studio.His early photographs depicted places like India and China; then came nature scenes. More recently he has added animals, like this monkey, left, clutching an applelike fruit, in- spired by a Du rer engraving.Mr. Massard spent six months creating the monkey, first using layers of cardboard to sug- gest its form. The face, hands and feet are made of dental composite and the fur of darn- ing wool, which he blended, combed and glued in tiny tufts to mosquito netting.This Edenic diorama is the first Mr. Mas- sard has shown in public. It also represents the first time he has captured an animal facing his camera. ''I wouldn't say that it is a self-portrait,'' he said, mentioning the primate-human bond, ''but there is something of that in it.''"

A citizen of Ireland and the USA, Irene was born in Brooklyn, attended catholic schools and became a graduate nurse from the Lenox Hill Hospital School of Nursing. She married and had three children; Minna, whose husband, Ned Pinger and children Belmont, Dash, and Zyla mourn her passing; Bram and his wife Erica, and Zachary and his wife Hannah and their children; Harry, Phoebe and Cayetana all share the tragedy of losing a mother and grandmother, as she approached her 75th year. She will also be mourned by her brother, Dan Lyons and his wife Judy and their children; Cathlin, and husband Eric, and their two children, Daniel and his wife Donna, and their two children, and Matthew Lyons. Finally, she will be missed by her former husband and friend Robert Towbin, who admired her unique understanding of good and bad and her willingness, to express her strong opinions. Irene was an accomplished artist who worked many years in her SoHo studio which she shared with her dear friend and fellow artist Kiki Kogelnik. Irene was more than a painter and maker of unique constructions, be it amusing statements of undeniable truths, or photos of things that would surely lose their glamour and moments of popular appeal. Her photos in the Dublin, Ireland, eatery, the Temple Bar, capture the SoHo of New York in the 1980's that no longer exists. Her growing interest in what governments are obligated to do for their citizens which started during the McCarthy era of the 1950s and translated, over the years, to a fierce defense of women's rights and disenfranchised people everywhere on this earth characterized her incisive strong and brave attitude to life. A growing distaste for the movement in her home country by right wing politicians infuriated her and as President George W. Bush became the favorite to win a second term, she decided to leave America and live in Ireland. She chose Galway as her home and created a unique spot in which to live. As she settled in, she began to travel and returned to Budapest, Hungary where Kiki had had a show years earlier, and bought an apartment there, on the river, and made her home both in Ireland and Budapest, entertaining her friends in both places in the ensuing years. Irene will be missed by friends in Ireland, Hungary and Staten Island where she bought two flats when the Staten Island Yankees came to town and sold one. The Yankees have not done as well. A memorial service will be held in New York City and details will be announced soon."

2011-06-12T00:00:00Z,"VIBRANT, independent and home to one of Europe's oldest universities, Bologna is a dynamic counterpoint to more popular, touristy cities like Rome and Florence. About 50 miles north of Florence, the city is as famous for its cuisine as it is for its fiery left-leaning politics. Market stalls brimming with asparagus and fava beans, specialty shops selling cured meats, and osterias serving fresh pasta with the city's signature ragù (known as Bolognese in the rest of the world) offer compelling reasons to linger. And then there are architectural masterpieces like the church of Santo Stefano and the iconic Due Torri (Two Towers). Grittier than in most of its northern counterparts, Bologna's politics -- the last mayor, Flavio Delbono, resigned when it was alleged that he was using public money on his mistress, and now residents are waiting to see if the new mayor, Virginio Merola, will make good on his promise to spruce up the city center -- somehow only adds to the excitement of a visit here.

2011-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Even as a child, Matthew Albanese said, ''I always wanted to be a photographer, however it manifested it- self.'' Now a product photographer at Barneys, he hap- pened upon his creative bliss in 2008, while shooting gadgets for his family's former online business.Bored by the subject at hand, Mr. Albanese, now 28, was playing around with lighting when he overturned a can of paprika in the warehouse kitchen. ''It reminded me of the surface of Mars,'' he said, ''and I thought I would try to create a barren landscape with it.'' Hun- dreds of pounds of sugar, spice and steel wool later, he had grown adept at coaxing humble materials into look- ing like something else (an ice floe, say, or a tornado) when fixed by his camera.The photographs, top and above right, and the dio- rama for them, above left, are homages to the wetlands of the Hackensack River in New Jersey, near where Mr. Albanese grew up. This is the only diorama he has built to last. He spent more than seven months turning os- trich feathers into willow trees (a painstaking process that involved dyeing, stitching and weaving each indi- vidual barb), tying raffia ribbon bits into cattails, and carving chocolate into mud. To capture the stormy scene Mr. Albanese turned on a fan and planted dry ice behind the cattails; for the sunset version, he placed cotton bat- ting and colored light bulbs behind a muslin sky. But as with all his work, he said: ''A lot of it is about how it's photographed. That's when the process comes alive.''"

But his pitchers will discover who he is. ''A lot of the kids have to Google you to see what your career was,'' Viola said last week. ''Once they realize what you did, you've got their respect and they're into you. But then if you can't help them along the way, it doesn't matter what you've done. So there's a fine line between using it to your advantage and losing the kid because you're talking about it too much. So hopefully, I'm doing it the right way.''"

He usually hits the sack at 10 p.m. - a lifestyle with which he has no complaints, he said, other than one: He has craved more time for writing.-''I arranged my schedule so, if I was feeling tired, it would be during work and not during playwriting,'' Mr. Pamatmat said.

But I've always thought it'd be great to figure out how to have a life that was wholly organized around my plays.'' He will soon have a chance. The Lark Play Development Center, now in its 17th year as a significant, nurturing artistic home in Manhattan for writers, announced Friday that it had given its fifth annual Playwrights of New York Fellowship to Mr. Pamatmat, 35, a Yale School of Drama graduate.

The delay of the rule, which will have a major impact on the nation's efforts to reduce emissions of gases blamed for the warming of the planet, is the latest step by the E.P.A. to slow the issuing of regulations that its critics claim will hurt economic growth, drive up energy costs and cut employment.

In a 1981 book, ''The Mismeasure of Man,'' the paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould asserted that Morton, believing that brain size was a measure of intelligence, had subconsciously manipulated the brain volumes of European, Asian and African skulls to favor his bias that Europeans had larger brains and Africans smaller ones."

2011-06-14T00:00:00Z,"RAHAL--James J. Rahal M.D. James J. Rahal, M.D. The world of medicine, and the world, lost a giant this weekend as Dr. James Rahal passed away. His many colleagues at New York Hospital Queens join, in deep sadness, his beloved family his wife Barbara Britton, his children James, Susan and Linda as well as his grandchildren Karyn, Carly and Christine, to mourn his death. We also celebrate his successes on the frontlines of the battle against some of the most challenging diseases of our time. Jim, as we all knew him, had a distinguished and productive career that spanned more than four decades. He dedicated his professional life to being a physician, scientist and professor in infectious disease and infection control. He achieved his undergraduate degree from Harvard-cum laude; and earned his medical degree from Tufts University-cum laude in 1959. He came to New York Hospital Queens as Director of Infectious Disease in 1988, and beyond the enormous contributions he made to the medical center's patients and his colleagues, he shaped the Infectious Disease specialists of the future as a clinical professor of medicine for Weill Medical College of Cornell University. In the 1980s and 1990s, he was recognized internationally as the scientific leader who discovered, and then published, his findings on the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. He was among the first to participate in trials with the then new cephalosporins. His work on multi-drug resistant gram negative bacilli has led the field and is often quoted. When HIV/AIDS emerged as a growing public health issue, he became actively involved in addressing innovative drug therapies, patient access to treatment and public policy decisions. Most significantly, he served as a member of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Data Safety Monitoring Board - a small group of multidisciplinary specialists, who determined the safety of national studies for HIV/AIDS. In 1999, he was one of the first physicians in the U.S. to recognize the outbreak pattern of the West Nile virus when it began infecting patients in Queens. He became one of the nation's foremost experts on the West Nile virus. He developed the first FDA-approved treatment for the West Nile virus in 2002, and he created a national, multi-site research protocol to determine the results of the Interferon alpha-2b for treatment of the virus. This unique protocol was patented in 2005. On a personal level, Dr. Rahal was recognized for his self-effacing and gracious manner. He was a consummate teacher and as a result, he received countless awards for teaching and research--including the Albion Bernstein MD Award in 2004 by the Medical Society of the State of New York. His work has been published in numerous prestigious journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA and Science magazine. The news media often sought his expertise on antibiotic resistance, the West Nile virus and infectious diseases. His studies, including those developed for the NIH, have affected many lives and have served to raise the bar of excellence in medicine and science for future generations.

Fierce defender of the Constitution and advocate for the less fortunate, he combined a passion for justice and command of the law with unassuming modesty and wisdom. The personification of class and conscience, Norman exemplified the words of the rabbis: ""He who runs from honor, will be pursued by it."" Richard S. Gordon, President"
2011-06-15T00:00:00Z,"RAHAL--James J. Rahal M.D. James J. Rahal, M.D. The world of medicine, and the world, lost a giant this weekend as Dr. James Rahal passed away. His many colleagues at New York Hospital Queens join, in deep sadness, his beloved family his wife Barbara Britton, his children James, Susan and Linda as well as his grandchildren Karyn, Carly and Christine, to mourn his death. We also celebrate his successes on the frontlines of the battle against some of the most challenging diseases of our time. Jim, as we all knew him, had a distinguished and productive career that spanned more than four decades. He dedicated his professional life to being a physician, scientist and professor in infectious disease and infection control. He achieved his undergraduate degree from Harvard-cum laude; and earned his medical degree from Tufts University-cum laude in 1959. He came to New York Hospital Queens as Director of Infectious Disease in 1988, and beyond the enormous contributions he made to the medical center's patients and his colleagues, he shaped the Infectious Disease specialists of the future as a clinical professor of medicine for Weill Medical College of Cornell University. In the 1980s and 1990s, he was recognized internationally as the scientific leader who discovered, and then published, his findings on the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. He was among the first to participate in trials with the then new cephalosporins. His work on multi-drug resistant gram negative bacilli has led the field and is often quoted. When HIV/AIDS emerged as a growing public health issue, he became actively involved in addressing innovative drug therapies, patient access to treatment and public policy decisions. Most significantly, he served as a member of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Data Safety Monitoring Board - a small group of multidisciplinary specialists, who determined the safety of national studies for HIV/AIDS. In 1999, he was one of the first physicians in the U.S. to recognize the outbreak pattern of the West Nile virus when it began infecting patients in Queens. He became one of the nation's foremost experts on the West Nile virus. He developed the first FDA-approved treatment for the West Nile virus in 2002, and he created a national, multi-site research protocol to determine the results of the Interferon alpha-2b for treatment of the virus. This unique protocol was patented in 2005. On a personal level, Dr. Rahal was recognized for his self-effacing and gracious manner. He was a consummate teacher and as a result, he received countless awards for teaching and research--including the Albion Bernstein MD Award in 2004 by the Medical Society of the State of New York. His work has been published in numerous prestigious journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA and Science magazine. The news media often sought his expertise on antibiotic resistance, the West Nile virus and infectious diseases. His studies, including those developed for the NIH, have affected many lives and have served to raise the bar of excellence in medicine and science for future generations.

They, along with his colleagues, patients and friends, loved him for his brilliant mind, his empathy and compassion, his creativity and his commitment to them. Dr. Cooper was an internationally recognized leader in psychoanalysis, a training analyst at Columbia University, a past-president of the American Psychoanalytic Association, a past president of the International Psychoanalytic Association, and a winner of the Sigourney Award. He was a distinguished scholar, past North American editor of The International Journal of Psychoanalysis and past deputy editor of The American Journal of Psychiatry.

New Yorkers are burdened with a similar feeling, the sense that back then -- then being a vague moment sometime before now, when La Guardia was mayor and the Dodgers were in Brooklyn and men wore hats and action painters hung out at CBGB and the Dutch had not yet landed -- was when things were really happening. The cinephile and Gothamite strains of nostalgia converge in secondhand, word-of-mouth memories of lining up downtown on Bleecker Street or St. Marks Place, or uptown at the Thalia, to see the latest Fassbinder, the Antonioni retrospective or the early work of Jim Jarmusch. Remember? I sort of do. (I didn't grow up here, but I've seen ''Annie Hall'' a bunch of times. ''Manhattan,'' too.) And yet if we take off our rose-colored glasses and look around at the city and its screens, a different picture emerges, with startling vividness. The golden age of New York moviegoing is now."
