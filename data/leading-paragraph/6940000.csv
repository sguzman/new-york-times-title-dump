It is baked a bit during the cheesemaking, so it acquires a dappled, lightly caramelized crust.

But the BNN network plans to proceed with the program on Friday, saying it believes that the show will draw attention to a shortage of organ donors. At least one parliament member said he would ask the government to block the broadcast of the ''Big Donor Show,'' produced by Endemol NV, creator of the ''Big Brother'' series. On the show a donor identified only as Lisa, 37, who is terminally ill with an inoperable brain tumor, will hear interviews with three candidates, their families and friends before deciding who will receive one of her kidneys. ''We know that this program is super-controversial, and some people will think it's tasteless,'' said Laurens Drillich, chairman of BNN, ''but we think the reality is even more shocking and tasteless: waiting for an organ is just like playing the lottery.'' Marieke Saly, a spokeswoman for BNN, said there could be no guarantees that the donation would actually be made, but said ''the intention'' was that the transplant would be carried out before Lisa died. Under Dutch rules, her designation of a recipient would become invalid after her death.

Brandy, 28, whose full name is Brandy Norwood, and Mallory Ham of Simi Valley, Calf., accuse each other of negligence in the lawsuits, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Brandy contends that Mr. Ham caused the crash on Dec. 30 in Sherman Oaks, Calif. His suit, seeking unspecified damages, contends that she drove recklessly. A California Highway Patrol report said Brandy's 2007 Range Rover failed to slow in traffic and was moving at 65 miles an hour when it struck another car that was hit in turn by Mr. Ham's vehicle. The crash killed Awatef Aboudihaj, 38, of Los Angeles. Yesterday Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for the city attorney's office in Los Angeles, said it was still deciding whether to charge Brandy with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter, which carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. Alagna Cancels Performances The French tenor Roberto Alagna, below, has canceled three performances of ''Il Trovatore'' in Madrid to undergo surgery on his nose, The Associated Press reported yesterday, citing the Madrid Opera house and Mr. Alagna's manager. Ines Toston, a spokeswoman for the Teatro Royal, said, ''Roberto Alagna is undergoing surgery between June 2 and 4, and after that he needs a recovery period of six weeks.'' In his first performances ever in Spain, Mr. Alagna had been scheduled to sing in ''Il Trovatore'' three times from June 7 to 29. He made headlines last year when he walked off the stage at La Scala in Milan after some members of the audience reacted with boos and whistles to his performance in a new production of ''Aida.'' A costume worn by the opera star Maria Callas has been stolen from an exhibition in Athens, Agence France-Presse reported. The theft took place on Friday at the Italian cultural center, where a two-week exhibition of Callas memorabilia, including costumes, jewelry and accessories, was in progress. Besides an opera competition, Greece has organized events this year to honor Callas (1923-1977). She was born to Greek immigrants in the United States and took Greek citizenship in 1966.

Mr. Cuomo's investigation identified instances in which loan companies paid universities based on the amounts borrowed by students, as well as questionable ties between financial aid administrators and lenders.

Most of the United States money reimburses the use of our military facilities and cost of operations in support of the United States-led counterterrorism war in Afghanistan.

2007-05-31T00:00:00Z,"A federal appeals court in Atlanta upheld a ruling yesterday awarding New York City more than $40 million from the trust for a bankrupt Florida-based asbestos company, the latest development in litigation that has lasted more than two decades. The company, the Celotex Corporation of Tampa, was among the companies sued by the city starting in 1985 to reclaim expenses incurred in removing asbestos from city-owned buildings. Celotex later filed for bankruptcy. New York City filed more than 740 claims in the case, but the Celotex trustees refused to pay some of them, arguing they were wrongly decided. Two judges and a federal court in Florida previously ruled in the city's favor, most recently in April 2005. Yesterday, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, upheld the lower court rulings, bringing the total payments from Celotex, including $11 million from previous claims, to more than $55 million.

They even sang the national anthem. The only thing missing was the Yankees. But that did not seem to matter. Their game against the Blue Jays in Toronto was being shown live on a large television screen. For a few hours in Midtown Manhattan, the Yankees' hideous start to the season was essentially forgotten. It helped that they scored five runs in the first inning, setting a festive tone as they went on to win, 10-5. Even before the game began, the third annual Pinstripes in the Park, presented by Continental Airlines, did not seem weighed down by the huge margin between the Yankees and the first-place Boston Red Sox."

That's very interesting, because David Gordon is first rate and not ideological, and because Policy Planning is a key portfolio in any administration in developing long-range policy. Of course, hard-liners in the Office of the Vice President can still out-maneuver the sensible people, as they have for most of the last six years, but it's nice to see good people appointed to top posts. Steve Clemons, who writes the Note, says that Gordon's appointment is indicative of better people going into posts more recently, and maybe there's some truth to that. If the administration had started with Bob Gates and Gordon England at the Pentagon, instead of Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, with Zoellick at the World Bank -- and, best of all, with somebody like Tom Ridge as vice president rather than Cheney -- then Bush might have avoided a failed presidency. Bush also might have done better in preserving his reputation if he had just been defeated for reelection, so that his fans could blame today's problems on John Kerry."

After exchanging the required hugs and kisses I thought, ""What do I do now?"" I thought for a moment and offered the suggestion, ""Let's go home."" And that's what we did. At T plus four minutes from setting foot in the continental United States it was already as if I was just coming home from another day of work.The feeling actually started on the bus on our way from March Air Reserve Base to Camp Pendleton.

The fatal beating followed an attack on Mr. Alexander&#8217;s companion, then 22, during a dispute, Mr. Brown said. Mr. Alexander was found working at a Brooklyn auto body shop after his story was broadcast last month on the television program &#8220;America&#8217;s Most Wanted,&#8221; Mr. Brown said."
2007-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Gov. Eliot Spitzer proposed new regulations yesterday that are expected to increase by more than fourfold state spending on civil legal services for the poor. The regulations will require banks to pay a far higher interest rate on funds deposited in special accounts that lawyers use to temporarily hold money deposited by clients. Interest from these accounts has traditionally been used to pay for civil legal services, but banks have been paying an interest rate of 0.5 percent, on average. The new regulations will require banks to pay a more competitive rate of about 2.7 percent. The change, which requires a 45-day comment period but not legislative approval, is expected to increase financing for civil legal services for the poor from more than $13 million to as much as $65 million."

But it's a bag full of fascinating curiosities. A few of the films, like tonight's opening feature, John Cassavetes's ''Faces,'' are relatively familiar. But where else will you see ''Cabiria'' (1914), left, an epic Italian silent set in the Punic Wars and made two years before ''Intolerance''? (It shows at 2 p.m. tomorrow.) Not to mention Jean Renoir's first solo film, ''La Fille de l'Eau'' (1925), or ''Terje Vigen'' (''A Man There Was,'' 1917), a silent film, based on an Ibsen poem, by the great Swedish director Victor Sjostrom, or a full-length, color-tinted print of the King Vidor masterpiece ''The Big Parade'' (1925). Choices from (somewhat) more recent years include Andy Warhol's ''Chelsea Girls'' (1966), properly split-screened; the rarely seen, unusually experimental Satyajit Ray film ''Nayak'' (''The Hero,'' 1966); and the terrific thriller ''Pretty Poison'' (1968) with Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld.

Mr. Wright brings ''My Trip to Al-Qaeda,'' his illuminating monologue about the rise of the Islamist movement, to Town Hall for two more performances next week, a follow-up to its popular Off Broadway run at the Culture Project this spring. A staff writer for The New Yorker, Mr. Wright is an expert on Mr. bin Laden and friends. His deeply researched book ''The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,'' from which this show is adapted, just won the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction. Directed by Gregory Mosher, Mr. Wright's friendly lecture (with slides and video) mixes contemporary history with his personal observations about the widening schism between Western values and the rigid tenets of Islamic fundamentalism. It provides a gripping, intimate and informed account of the web of social, economic and political factors that gave rise to the conflicts now inflaming the Middle East.

The 1980 cult roller-disco film about a Greek muse sent to earth goes Broadway -- and it's about time. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40).Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side. (Isherwood) 'CIRKUS INFERNO' Happy lunacy (1:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists clichéd feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Bellafante) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'THE J.A.P. SHOW: JEWISH AMERICAN PRINCESSES of comedy' Laughs along with longueurs (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Van Gelder) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clichéd territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) * 'PASSING STRANGE' The composer and performer Stew narrates this semiautobiographical show about a songwriter on a journey of self-discovery. Part rock concert, part book musical, it flows smoothly on a strong current of feeling and humor as the Los Angeles-born central character searches for his musical voice in the hash bars of Amsterdam and the cabarets of Berlin (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25).

(Brantley) Last Chance 'BEAUTY ON THE VINE' Zak Berkman presents muddled politics and distorted anxieties in his quasi-science-fiction play about the influence of plastic surgery on young women who start modeling themselves after a right-wing radio host. Adding to the atmosphere of hysteria is the inability of the actors onstage to render a single subtle or nuanced moment (2:10). Harold Clurman Theater, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 'DAUGHTER OF A CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY' A standard-issue solo play about a fascinating Cuban family (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'GOD'S EAR' Jenny Schwartz's formally inventive and brilliantly performed drama about how the death of a child affects a family is more interested in language than in narrative (1:20). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'I LOVE YOU , YOU'RE PERFECT, NOW CHANGE!' This revue has proved as indestructible as the truisms about men and women on which it is based: it has run for 11 years Off Broadway and spread around the world. Now one of its avatars is coming for a visit: the Mandarin production with Lin Yilun, a major Chinese star, has arrived in New York for a limited run, playing concurrently with the English version. This is supposedly the first time a foreign production of an American musical has played in the United States (and the first Chinese-language production of a major American musical). It will be interesting to see how the piece's hoary stereotypes change in translation; Joel Bishoff, the original director, modified the work to reflect Chinese culture for its Shanghai run (2:00). The Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; Mandarin version closes on Sunday. (Anne Midgette) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10).

Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AMU' (No rating, 102 minutes, in English, Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi) This ambitious first feature by Shonali Bose, about Kaju, a young Indian-American woman searching for the real India and for her roots, begins as a gentle comedy of cultures clashing. Its true topic, though, is the riots that broke out in Delhi in 1984 after Indira Gandhi's assassination. Thousands of Sikhs were killed, and as Kaju learns, justice has been delayed and denied. (Rachel Saltz) 'ANGEL-A' (R, 90 minutes) Beneath its sophisticated Gallic gloss, this handsomely photographed feel-good fantasy, which shamelessly recycles ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and ''Heaven Can Wait,'' suggests an episode of ''Touched by an Angel'' without the tears. (Stephen Holden) * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'BLADES OF GLORY' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Holden) 'THE BOSS OF IT ALL' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Danish) To describe ''The Boss of It All,'' Lars von Trier's acidic corporate comedy, as '' 'The Office' viewed through the looking glass'' only scratches the surface of the newest film from one of the foremost tricksters of world cinema. (Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'BROOKLYN RULES' (R, 99 minutes) However authentic and heartfelt this film's depiction of life on the meaner streets of the Northeast corridor may be, its story of three friends growing up in a mob-infested Brooklyn neighborhood doesn't begin to match ''The Sopranos'' in its epic vision of violence, class struggle and upward mobility in a barbarous culture. (Holden) 'BUG' (R, 102 minutes) In this overwrought psychodrama from the director William Friedkin, Ashley Judd's acting continues to surpass her career choices. Playing a shaky Oklahoma barmaid, she convincingly juggles an abusive husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and a newfound lover (Michael Shannon) who sees creepy-crawlies in the mattress and conspiracies everywhere. Though the movie's escalating hysteria may strain credulity, Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'DAY NIGHT DAY NIGHT' (No rating, 94 minutes) For most of its 94 minutes, this gripping but evasive portrait of an unidentified 19-year-old terrorist undertaking a suicide bombing mission in Times Square focuses on the face of its star, Luisa Williams. (Holden) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) 'EVEN MONEY' (R, 108 minutes) This grim, lurid scare movie about gambling addiction consists of several interlocking horror stories that converge in a format similar to that of ''Crash.'' More than its forerunner, this film sacrifices realism to forced plot mechanics. (Holden) 'FAY GRIM' (R, 118 minutes) Too light-headed to qualify as satire, too poker-faced to register as comedy, this elaborate spy spoof, a sequel to ''Henry Fool,'' belongs in its own stylistic niche: the Hal Hartley film. Movies emanating from Planet Hartley are an acquired taste shared by hipper-than-thou insiders. (Holden) 'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Dargis) 'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott) 'GRINDHOUSE' (R, 180 minutes) A double feature, complete with fake previews for schlocky exploitation pictures, that pays nostalgic tribute to disreputable traditions of moviemaking and moviegoing. Robert Rodriguez contributes ''Planet Terror,'' a purposely incoherent zombie gross-out flick that flaunts is own badness the way Rose McGowan (as a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling) shows off her weaponized prosthetic leg. For his part, Quentin Tarantino, more of a connoisseur than his collaborator (and a much better filmmaker), turns out a brutal, talky and satisfying car-chase revenge movie in ''Death Proof,'' starring Kurt Russell. (Scott) * 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis) * 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis) 'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn that there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) 'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis) '9 STAR HOTEL' (No rating, 78 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) Ido Haar's fascinating documentary follows a group of illegal Palestinian construction workers as they scrabble to survive in and around the Israeli city of Modiin. With an open mind and a handheld camera, this Israeli filmmaker strives to make the political personal; but by excluding Israeli voices, Mr. Haar has produced a work filled with immediacy but free of analysis. (Catsoulis) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) * 'PAPRIKA' (R, 90 minutes, in Japanese) In this gorgeous riot of future-shock ideas and brightly animated imagery, the doors of perception never close. Satoshi Kon's mind-twisting, eye-tickling animé isn't greasy kid's stuff: it's for thinking, interested adults whose sense of wonder remains as alive as their imaginations. (Dargis) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis) 'SEVERANCE' (R, 90 minutes) A weapons company retreat in a Hungarian forest turns into a bloody game of whack-a-mole in this sophomore horror film from the British director Christopher Smith. The political argument may be broad -- there is some satisfaction in seeing the gung-ho team leader hoisted by his own explosive petard -- but the visual technique is sharp, creating a lively romp through terrain less traveled than you might think. (Catsoulis) 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Saltz) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series and Revivals SAM FULLER (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image continues its survey of the work of the tabloid-trained film director Samuel Fuller. The highlights in this session are 35-millimeter prints of Fuller's two films for Allied Artists, from the U.C.L.A. Film and Television Archive: the astounding ''Shock Corridor,'' in which a madhouse becomes a metaphor for American society about 1963, and ''The Naked Kiss'' (1964), the only film I can think of offhand that begins with a bald prostitute (Constance Towers) beating her pimp to death with a telephone handset. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Dave Kehr) 'MALA NOCHE' (Tonight through Thursday) Gus Van Sant's first feature, shot in Portland in 1985, announces many of the themes of his later work but operates with a ragged spontaneity that has largely vanished from his highly formalist recent features. Tim Streeter stars as Walt, a convenience-store clerk who conceives a one-sided love for a Mexican teenager (Doug Cooeyate). The film, shot in black-and-white 16-millimeter, has now been digitally restored and features a new soundtrack remastered by Mr. Van Sant. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $10.75. (Kehr) SUNDANCE INSTITUTE AT BAM (Tonight through Thursday) For a second year, the organizers of the Sundance Film Festival are taking a selection of films, theater and music created or presented under their aegis to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The film component includes seven features from this year's Sundance festival that have not yet found theatrical distribution (including ''Padre Nuestro,'' the winner of this year's Grand Jury Prize for dramatic film), so this may be the one chance New Yorkers will have to see them on a screen. This weekend's screenings include: ''Rocket Science,'' the fiction debut of Jeffrey Blitz, who directed the documentary ''Spellbound''; ''War/Dance,'' a documentary by Sean Fine and Andrea Nix Fine about three children growing up in the combat zone of northern Uganda; ''Snow Angels,'' a drama by David Gordon Green (''George Washington'') starring Sam Rockwell as an alcoholic Southerner in the painful process of separating from his wife (Kate Beckinsale); ''Delirious,'' Tom DiCillo's comic portrait of a desperate paparazzi (Steve Buscemi); and ''Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten,'' a documentary about the drummer of The Clash, directed by the music video pioneer Julien Temple. Sunday is devoted to four programs that together contain 27 short films. The series continues through June 10. BAMcinématek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. KEREN ANN (Monday) With exquisitely delicate, sensuous songs that seem never to touch the ground, Keren Ann Zeidel -- born in Tel Aviv and raised in Paris -- is the model of the modern cosmopolitan chanteuse, part jazzy, part indie-cabaret and part glam-folk. With Jason Hart. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Ben Sisario) ALAN BERGMAN (Tuesday) With a new album, ''Lyrically, Alan Bergman'' (Verve), this three-time Oscar-winning songwriter (''The Windmills of Your Mind,'' ''The Way We Were'') makes a rare appearance at Joe's Pub. At 9:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) BRAZZAVILLE (Tonight) While playing saxophone for Beck in the '90s, David Brown learned guitar and started Brazzaville, writing languid, bittersweet songs in a multicultural update of the vagabond cabaret of Tom Waits and Tindersticks. Four years ago he relocated to Barcelona and formed a new version of the band, still singing about crumbling cafes and the way his former lovers held their cigarettes. The new Brazzaville makes its American debut tonight at 9:30 at Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) * BRIGHT EYES (Tonight) In the indie-rock equivalent of Bruce Springsteen's filling up Giants Stadium for weeks on end, Bright Eyes -- consisting of the excessively confessional man-child Conor Oberst (dressed in Prada these days) and whomever he's playing with -- has sold out seven shows at Town Hall, ending tonight. His guest is Gillian Welch, who plays a mellow bluegrass-folk hybrid with grace. At 7:30, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org. (Sisario) CALIFONE (Thursday) A mainstay of the Chicago experimental-rock scene, Califone plays wistful songs with a constant thin hum. With the Bitter Tears and Curtis Harvey. At 8 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $15. (Sisario) * JUDY COLLINS (Tuesday through Thursday) What Ms. Collins brings to a song, whether she wrote it or not, is perspective. You have the sense of a woman standing alone in the night air, gazing at a star and directing a beam of psychic energy into the cosmos. Or maybe she is the receiver of this cool, steady light; it cuts both ways. She is back at the Café Carlyle for a series of encore performances. At 8:45 p.m., Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $150 cover at tables, $100 at the bar. (Stephen Holden) CSS (Tonight) Over bare, exuberant and deliberately amateurish art-funk, this mostly female Brazilian group celebrates the sacrament of casual sex through come-ons shouted and mumbled in robotic, broken English. (''Kiss-kiss-kiss will make this earth quake.'') With Yo Majesty. At 9, Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario) * DATAROCK (Tomorrow) It might seem impossible at this point to find something new on the well-traveled path of electro dance-rock. But somehow this Norwegian duo does it, with spiky disco, a full supply of funk guitar riffs and a rock 'n' roll attitude that mixes snarls with catchy, silly ''Fa-fa-fa fa-fa-fa-fa-fa'' choruses. With Low Bee and Passions. At 10 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $10. (Sisario) DEAN AND BRITTA (Tomorrow) In Luna, Dean Wareham expertly channeled the cool, slow-shifting guitar clouds of the mid-period Velvet Underground. Since dissolving Luna two years ago, he has been playing with its former bassist, Britta Phillips, and on their new album, ''Back Numbers'' (Zoe/Rounder), they emulate, with unfortunate stiffness, another touchstone of 1960s cool: the bare, dissolute country of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra. With My Robot Friend. At 9:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171, lunalounge.com; $18. (Sisario) * DINOSAUR JR., AWESOME COLOR (Wednesday and Thursday) One of the greatest and most influential original grunge bands, Dinosaur Jr. joined mopey lyrics to furious guitar sludge, prefiguring Nirvana. Long estranged, the original lineup of J Mascis on guitar, Lou Barlow on bass and Murph on drums reunited two years ago and just released ''Beyond'' (Fat Possum), their first album together in 18 years, sounding as brawny and vigorous as ever. Awesome Color's gruff, retro garage-blues is self-consciously noisy as only New York rock can be, but it is also indebted -- and seems partly a homage -- to the vintage Detroit proto-punk of the Stooges and the MC5. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario) JOHN DOE (Wednesday and Thursday) In the seminal Los Angeles punk band X and on his own, John Doe has linked a rugged sentimentality to twangy, rockabilly-tinged songs, and is particularly good at singing with women. His latest, ''A Year in the Wilderness'' (Yep Roc), features Aimee Mann, Jill Sobule and Kathleen Edwards aside longtime collaborators like the guitarist Dave Alvin. Wednesday at 9 p.m., BAMCafé, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; no cover. Thursday at 8 p.m., Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $10. (Sisario) * ROKY ERICKSON AND ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO (Tomorrow) One of the godfathers of psychedelic rock, who howled like a werewolf over the flutter of an electric jug in his 1960s band the 13th Floor Elevators, Roky Erickson is also one of the most notorious casualties of that era. Now, at 59 and in his best health in years, he is back on the road with a tough, no-nonsense band, and at his belated New York debut seven weeks ago tore through classics like ''You're Gonna Miss Me'' with ease and lots of low-end guitar fuzz. Alejandro Escovedo's songs stare down loss and mortality with a mixture of unflinching memory and a rocker's defiance. At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789, rivertorivernyc.com. Free; tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Sisario) FAIRPORT CONVENTION (Sunday) One original member and two later recruits of this groundbreaking British progressive-folk group from the 1960s and '70s -- the guitarist Simon Nicol, who was in it from the beginning, along with the violinist and mandolin player Chris Leslie and the violinist Ric Sanders -- play an acoustic set of Fairport Convention songs, jazz and swing standards and traditional folk. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) MARIANNE FAITHFULL (Wednesday) Marianne Faithfull applies her husky ruin of a voice to songs about harrowing moments and bitter realizations. In songs she wrote herself or chose with exacting standards, she reveals every scar with bleak fascination and no regrets. At 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212) 307-7171; $75. (Jon Pareles) FALL OUT BOY, +44, THE ACADEMY IS , PAUL WALL, COBRA STARSHIP (Tuesday and Wednesday) They could have called it Monsters of Emo, but certain considerations led to a name that is less rock 'n' roll but perhaps just as indicative of mainstream success: the Honda Civic Tour. Fall Out Boy remains the model second-wave (or is this the third?) emo band: snarky and jumpy, interested in relationships over solitude, and bursting with melodic pop-punk riffs. Also on the bill are +44, with Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker of Blink-182; the Houston rapper Paul Wall; and Cobra Starship, adrift in a sea of dance-punk irony. Tuesday at 6 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $25 and $40. Wednesday at 6 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; $23.75 and $39.50. (Sisario) NELLY FURTADO (Thursday) Last year Ms. Furtado and Justin Timberlake demonstrated a truism of 21st-century pop: work with Timbaland and ye shall receive bucketfuls of hits and be reborn as a star. Opening the show are Kenna and Saukrates. At 8 p.m., WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741 or (212) 307-4111, thegarden.com; $45 to $65. (Sisario) THE HORRORS (Monday) Recalling the early Damned, this British band sticks to dark, cold and gloomy in its albums but comes alive -- or is that fully undead? -- onstage. With Schoolyard Heroes and Night Kills The Day. At 8:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171, lunalounge.com; $14. (Sisario) * HOT 97 SUMMER JAM (Sunday) This annual mega-concert presented by the radio station Hot 97 (WQHT-FM) is always one of the most talked-about hip-hop events in the country, as much because of the starry lineup as because of the sparks that sometimes fly between its members. This year the stage is particularly overstocked, with Ludacris, Akon, Chris Brown with Lil Wayne and Birdman, Diddy with Keyshia Cole and Elephant Man, Ne-Yo, Ciara, Young Jeezy, Mims, Swizz Beatz, Rich Boy and T-Pain. At 6:30 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $40 to $165. (Sisario) CALVIN JOHNSON, JULIE DOIRON (Tonight) Mr. Johnson, the granddaddy of the Northwest punk scene, is a dedicated pop primitivist whose odes to the uncorrupted child-savage within are delivered in a froggy and purposely tuneless bass that sounds anything but childlike. Ms. Doiron, formerly of the band Eric's Trip, is too talented a songwriter for gimmickry, singing with quiet intensity about the agony of kissing ''the wrong guy.''

At 8 p.m., Church of the Holy Trinity, 316 East 88th Street, Manhattan, (212) 842-1511, nasingers.org; $20. (Midgette) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) The Philharmonic's Brahms series, conducted by Lorin Maazel, ambles on in this morning's performance of the Third and Fourth Symphonies and then heats up for the next week. A new Brahms program tomorrow evening, repeated on Tuesday, offers the ''Haydn'' Variations and the ''German'' Requiem, with the soprano Celena Shafer and the baritone Matthias Goerne. A whole new program on Thursday brings the conductor Riccardo Muti, and Lang Lang as soloist, in the Beethoven ''Emperor'' Concerto. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $29 to $104. (Holland) * LUCY SHELTON (Tuesday) The Movado Hour is a series of one-hour chamber music concerts presented by the enterprising Baryshnikov Arts Center in a wonderfully informal salon setting. Tuesday's enticing program offers the soprano (and contemporary-music champion) Lucy Shelton; the pianist Pedja Muzijevic, who is also the center's director of music programs; and the dynamic Brentano String Quartet in a program of works by George Crumb (''Apparitions'') and Brahms (the Piano Quintet in F minor). At 7 p.m., 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (917) 934-4966, baryshinikovdancefoundation.org; free, but reservations are required. (Tommasini) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Tonight, tomorrow and Monday through Thursday) It's here at last: the controversial new production of ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' created by Gelsey Kirkland, Kevin McKenzie and Michael Chernov. If even half the rumors pan out, this re-envisioning of a classic should be revelatory, and a trip. The leads -- the Princess Aurora, her prince, the Lilac Fairy and the evil Carabosse -- will be danced by Veronika Part, Marcelo Gomes, Gillian Murphy and Martine van Hamel (tonight); Paloma Herrera, Ángel Corella, Michele Wiles and Carmen Corella (tomorrow's matinee and Thursday); Julie Kent, Ethan Stiefel, Stella Abrera and Ms. van Hamel (tomorrow night and Tuesday); Ms. Part, Mr. Gomes, Ms. Murphy and Ms. Kirkland (Monday); Irina Dvorovenko, Maxim Beloserkovsky, Ms. Wiles and Ms. Kirkland (Wednesday matinee), and Diana Vishneva, David Hallberg, Ms. Abrera and Ms. van Hamel (Wednesday night). Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, abt.org; $24 to $110. (Jennifer Dunning) RENEE ARCHIBALD (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Archibald's ''Oh Dear Natascha'' explores darkness and confinement in an environment filled with small piles of samples and clippings quietly waiting, as Ms. Archibald puts it, ''for an imaginary domestic life in various imaginary cities.'' Well, why not? At 8, the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15. (Dunning) LORI BELILOVE (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Belilove, who specializes in the dances of Isadora Duncan, will present her own choreography in a program titled ''The EveryWoman Series: The Red Thread.'' The dances are set to music by Chopin, performed live. (Through June 8.) At 8 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 691-5040, isadoraduncan.org; $28; $60 for gala on Thursday. (Dunning) * BOOGIE DOWN DANCE SERIES AT BAAD! (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday) In its last week the festival will present dance by the Arthur Aviles Typical Theater troupe (tonight and tomorrow night); ''Dancing on Broken Glass,'' a panel discussion on the growth and state of professional dance in the Bronx (Tuesday); and an evening of Bronx-based dance by artists chosen by Christal Brown and Movement Research (Wednesday).

(Dunning) DANCE AT DNA (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) In Ben Munisteri's new ''Terra Nova,'' dancers leave a design of moving colors and patterns in their wake, courtesy of motion-capture technology. (Through Sunday.) The Stefanie Nelson Dance Group follows on Thursday in Ms. Nelson's new mixed-media ''Out of Wonderland,'' a collaboration with the video artist Nell Breyer and the composer Andrea Ferrara. (Through June 9.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, dnadance.org; $25 tonight through Sunday; $17 on Thursday. (Dunning) DANIEL GWIRTZMAN DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) Apparently Mr. Gwirtzman was once known as ''Disco Danny,'' which suggests that his new evening-length ''Encore,'' set to jazz and popular music, may indeed offer the ''accessibility and entertainment value'' that its publicity promises. Perhaps there will even be a disco ball. (Through June 9.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $25; $15 for students. (Roslyn Sulcas) KOOSIL-JA'S MECH[A] OUTPUT (Tonight and tomorrow night) Koosil-Ja Hwang blends elements of dance and music from the classic Japanese Noh play ''Dojoji'' with what she describes as multimedia technology, including live 3-D video.

Or one, perhaps, given the seamlessness of their funny, imaginative and profoundly poignant dance-theater duos. Their program, ''Pieces of Pieces,'' offers a rare chance to see them perform together. At 7 p.m., Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Malcolm X Boulevard, at 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2206; $12. (Dunning) * MOMIX (Tonight through Thursday) A company that revels in acrobatic movement and theatrical illusion reviews a quarter-century in ''Momix reMIX.'' (Through June 10.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44. (Jack Anderson) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The week's programming includes ''Three by Bach'' (''Concerto Barocco,'' ''Tribute'' and ''Brandenburg''), tonight and on Wednesday; ''Three Masters: Tchaikovsky, Balanchine, Robbins'' (''Mozartiana,'' ''Piano Pieces'' and ''Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2''), tomorrow afternoon; ''Essential Robbins'' (''In G Major,'' ''Dances at a Gathering,'' ''I'm Old Fashioned''), tomorrow night; ''International Balanchine'' (''Serenade,'' ''Bugaku'' and ''Union Jack''), on Sunday and Tuesday; and a one-time lineup of ''Serenade,'' Peter Martins's ''Gentilhommes'' (danced by students from the School of American Ballet) and Balanchine's ''Union Jack,'' on Thursday. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m.; New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $86. (Dunning) JENNY ROCHA DANCE THEATER/JASON DIETZ MARCHANT AND LINDSEY DIETZ MARCHANT (Tonight through Sunday night) The emotional and physical interaction between couples seems to be the theme of this double bill at Danspace: Ms. Rocha performs with her longtime dance partner Christine Poland in ''just barely,'' and Mr. and Ms. Dietz Marchant present ''Inflatable Man, Evaporating Woman.'' At 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15; members $10. (Sulcas) * SCHOOL OF AMERICAN BALLET 2007 WORKSHOP PERFORMANCES (Tomorrow and Monday) Always a mix of radiant idealism and shrewd competitiveness, this event promises extra luster this year as it pays tribute to Lincoln Kirstein, who founded the school and the New York City Ballet with George Balanchine. The young dancers will perform Balanchine's rarely seen but lovely ''Gounod Symphony,'' his ''Four Temperaments,'' Peter Martins's ''Gentilhommes'' and a new work by Sean Lavery, set to Mozart, called ''Twinkliana.'' Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Monday at 7 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-6600, sab.org; $40 tomorrow, $70 on Monday. (Dunning) * SITELINES 2007: MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY (Today through Sunday) This site-specific festival opens tonight with an outdoor performance by the Graham company of ''Steps in the Streets'' and ''Prelude to Action.'' At 12:30 p.m. (Festival continues through Sept. 14.) Wall and Broad Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 219-9401, lmcc.net/sitelines. (Dunning) STREB S.L.A.M. 9 (Tonight through Sunday) High-flying, wall-crashing thrills and chills, and popcorn besides. (Through June 17.) Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 3 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Streb Laboratory for Action Mechanics, 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 352-3101, strebusa.org; $20; $10 for children. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this assembly of pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn't venture beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith) * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Michael Kimmelman) * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS:THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at Cézanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'POIRET: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith) THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through June 17. The symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott) * EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE DISAPPEARED (LOS DESAPARECIDOS),' through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) STOREFRONT FOR ART AND ARCHITECTURE: 'CCCP: COSMIC COMMUNIST CONSTRUCTIONS PHOTOGRAPHED,' through June 16. This show, packed with obscure architectural gems, reopens on Tuesday. Covering a period ignored by academics and mainstream architects, it relies almost exclusively on the photographs of Frédéric Chaubin, who spent five years traveling across the former Soviet Union, uncovering forgotten architectural works in cities like Tbilisi, Yalta and Yerevan. The results are a revelation. Among the outright gems is Georgy Chakhava's 1975 Roads Ministry building, a monumental grid of interlocking concrete forms rising on a steep, wooded site in Tbilisi, Georgia. Set on an incline between two highways, the building's heavy, cantilevered forms reflect the Soviet-era penchant for heroic scale. Yet they also relate sensitively to their context, celebrating the natural landscape that flows directly underneath the building. What's refreshing about this exhibition is its lack of an ideological agenda: it is open to all sorts of possibilities. The Gaudíesque romanticism of a sanitarium in Druskininkai, Lithuania, for example, spins the aesthetic off in yet another direction. Compelling and easy to digest, this show piques our interest in ways that some larger institutions, ever more averse to risk, often fail to do. 97 Kenmare Street, Little Italy, (212) 431-5795, storefrontnews.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, 'WHERE WERE WE,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein's brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown YAYOI KUSAMA: FROM HERE TO INFINITY Spanning 50 years, this 24-piece overview is notable for its high quality and for unfamiliar works that sharpen the understanding of this artist's protean talent, among them several small, pungently colored folk-arty paintings that deploy her signature (and obsessive) webs, dots and scale patterns as effectively as her more abstract works do. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through June 8. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea * FRANCESCO CLEMENTE: PORTRAITS The works in this show reveal Mr. Clemente's relatively recent endeavors as a suave society portraitist, working on commission in single, daylong sittings. His subjects, while horizontal, don't so much recline as float toward the picture plane, surveying us with enormous eyes. The images can border on illustration, but sometimes color, space and personality collude to enchanting effect. Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929, through June 30. (Smith) * VALSAN KOORMA KOLLERI This Indian artist turns found objects, castoff materials and local stone from Kerala, where he lives, into large but delicate abstract sculptures. Copper vessels become containers for air and space; metal clock springs are woven into a time-rusted open-work basket; the simplest forms are ornamented with embedded glass beads. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 673-3096, through June 16. (Cotter) Galleries: Other * MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: PREIS PAINTINGS Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, www.1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) OLIVER TWIST Each month this new gallery will rent its space to hip out-of-town galleries, a plan that could unsettle the home-away balance of powers in New York. The inaugural show, while something of a mish-mash, presents works by 29 artists represented by the renters of the coming season. Enjoy the sixth-floor space's Chelsea-like light and view, and stay tuned. Rental, 120 East Broadway, at Allen Street, Lower East Side, (212) 608-6002, through June 16. (Smith) Public Art MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures -- ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct'' -- and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-foot-tall-by-45-foot-wide sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin, and the other's end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, www.madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Benjamin Genocchio) Last Chance * MEQUITTA AHUJA AND CHARLES RITCHIE Ms. Ahuja makes her New York solo debut with large paintings on paper of mythical beings,half woman, half animal, dressed in robes as brilliantly colored as the tropical fruit and flowers around them. Referring to the artist's African-American and East Indian background, the pictures turn marginality into a regal condition. The gallery also kicks off its new artist's book program with a display of sketch books by Mr. Ritchie, an artist based in Maryland. Each small book is filled with marvelous watercolors and all but indecipherable writing. Mr. Ritchie has been making such books for 30 years. They are extraordinary. BravinLee Programs, 526 West 26th Street, 2nd floor, (212) 462-4406, closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * FRANCESCO CLEMENTE: WORKS, 1971-1979 A selection of nearly 70 little-known early drawings and intriguing photo-works shows this young, restless proto-Neo-Expressionist overcoming the gravitational pull of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art, and broaching themes of the body, sexuality and the inner life that would blossom in his large paintings of the 1980s. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * JOANNA MALINOWSKA Joanna Malinowska traveled to windswept Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic last year in the footsteps of the anthropologist Franz Boas, who studied the Inuit there a century ago. The subject of Ms. Malinowska's research turns out to be a Native American musician and Elvis impersonator named Jimmy Ekho, and the film they made together is funny and moving. For another video Ms. Malinowska set a solar-powered boom-box in the middle of the Arctic wasteland, where it will play Glenn Gould's 1981 version of Bach's ''Goldberg Variations'' for as long as the sun shines. Venetia Kapernekas Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, eighth floor, (212) 462-4150, closes tomorrow. (Cotter) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE' I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark's formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org, closes on Sunday. (Kimmelman)"

2007-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Almost 40 years ago the Tony Williams Lifetime pioneered a brand of superheated fusion that brooked no qualms or disclaimers. There were just three musicians in the original incarnation of the band -- John McLaughlin on guitar, Larry Young on Hammond B-3 organ and Tony Williams on drums -- but its sound could be crushingly massive. This had a lot to do with the intensity of its namesake leader, who had been pushing toward jazz-rock even during his celebrated tenure with the Miles Davis Quintet. Mr. Williams, who died in 1997, played the drums with a forward-tilt aggression that was matched by his intuitive sophistication. In Lifetime the balance often tilted to favor power over finesse. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.) That isn't the case with Trio Beyond, above, a tribute band consisting of the drummer Jack DeJohnette, the guitarist John Scofield and the keyboardist Larry Goldings. Formed by Mr. DeJohnette, Mr. Williams's loose-limbed successor with Miles Davis, the group recently released a live double album -- ''Saudades'' (ECM), recorded in 2004 -- that features not only Lifetime staples but also milestones of Mr. Williams's sideman career, songs associated with Mr. Young and even a bit of original material. The point seems to be a particular species of interaction, more than a repertory or even a style. So Mr. Scofield, another Davis alumnus, has no imperative to imitate Mr. McLaughlin; he sounds like a pumped-up version of himself. The same is true of his bandmates, who allude to their predecessors without overdoing the emulation. Appropriately, the musicians sound best when they're blazing together through an anthem like ''Emergency,'' seemingly without much concern for how the music might be classified. It's in their fierce commitment that they honor Mr. Williams best.

2007-06-01T00:00:00Z,"The vibrations are somewhere on the brink between good and bad in the songs of Animal Collective, a group formed in New York seven years ago by old friends from Baltimore whose songs are as joyous are they are eerie. Building on loose improvisations with lo-fi instrumentation that makes them sound like a folkier version of Pavement, the four pseudonymous members of Animal Collective -- (shown, from left) Geologist, Avey Tare, Deacon and Panda Bear, though they don't seem to mind being called Brian, Dave, Josh and Noah -- send the sunniest and most playful Beach Boys melodies through endless, sometimes frightening psychedelic transformations, guided by dream logic and a love of the carnivalesque. ''I think it's all right to feel inhuman,'' sings Avey Tare over weirdly pulsating electronics and thudding tribal rhythms on ''Strawberry Jam'' (Domino), their outstanding new album, to be released in September. The band plays tonight with Danielson at the opening of the Seaport Music Festival at South Street Seaport, an essential indie-rock series that runs through the end of August as part of the River to River Festival in Lower Manhattan. Others at the Seaport this summer include Fujiya & Miyagi, Menomena, Bishop Allen, Camera Obscura, the National and Battles.

CW's ''Hidden Palms'' also made its debut in the hour, but came in last place with a disappointing 1.8 million viewers. At 10, a repeat of CBS's ''CSI: NY,'' the night's most-watched show, led the hour over all, lifting CBS into second place for the night behind Fox.

This exhibition of about three dozen canvases ranging in dates from 1910 to the mid-1960s is the first in recent memory devoted solely to her work. It is not quite as top-notch as previous glimpses had led me to hope, but it is a moving and informative homage to a woman who was something of a pioneer of European Modernism in the United States."

Lawyers for the governor say that the e-mail messages between Mr. Corzine and Carla Katz, president of the Communications Workers of America Local 1034, are protected by gubernatorial privilege. Mr. Corzine's lawyers also point out that a state ethics panel has reviewed the messages and concluded that the governor acted appropriately. But Mark Sheridan, a lawyer for the Republican State Committee, said the law required Mr. Corzine to disclose any correspondence that discusses the contract negotiations because they involve state business.

An estimated 23 million American adults are doing so now, according to a survey by Chorus America, an association of vocal ensembles. With numbers like that, it's not hard to understand why so many people love choral music. Whether experienced from within the chorus or from the audience outside, the unique sound of music made by groups of people using their own voices has a universal appeal. At choral festivals this spring and summer, audiences will hear classic and modern choral works, often directed by renowned conductors, in settings ranging from a lavish California performance hall to a hockey rink in Massachusetts. And some music lovers will also be able to mingle with singers or do some singing themselves."

2007-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Gov. Eliot Spitzer proposed new regulations yesterday that are expected to increase by more than fourfold state spending on civil legal services for the poor. The regulations will require banks to pay a far higher interest rate on funds deposited in special accounts that lawyers use to temporarily hold money deposited by clients. Interest from these accounts has traditionally been used to pay for civil legal services, but banks have been paying an interest rate of 0.5 percent, on average. The new regulations will require banks to pay a more competitive rate of about 2.7 percent. The change, which requires a 45-day comment period but not legislative approval, is expected to increase financing for civil legal services for the poor from more than $13 million to as much as $65 million.

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"WALLER--Leslie, April 1, 1923-March 29, 2007. Author of more than 50 books, Leslie Waller passed away March 29th, 2007, in Rochester, NY, of natural causes attended by family. Waller is most well known for his New York Times best seller, The American, the novelization of Dog Day Afternoon, under his pseudonym, Patrick Mann, and his original story, Hide in Plain Sight, made by James Caan into a movie. Waller was the ghost writer for Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and coauthor, with Arnold Blake, of It Rhymes with Lust, which some have suggested is the first modern graphic novel, recently re-issued by Dark Horse Comics. A memorial will be held for him on Wednesday, June 6th, 2007, at Writers & Books, 740 University Avenue, Rochester, NY, 5-8 pm, with remarks at 6:30 pm. The public is welcome.

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: As the author of ''A Farewell to Justice,'' which challenges the conclusions of the Warren Commission, I was taken aback by Bryan Burrough's suggestion in his review of ''Reclaiming History,'' by Vincent Bugliosi (May 20), that those who do not accept Bugliosi's defense of the Warren report should be ''marginalized'' and made to ''stand in the rain with the other outcasts.'' Ideas, after all, are best argued on their merit, and the First Amendment of the Constitution appears to encourage debate even on issues of received wisdom. Burrough apparently has no stomach for the subject, as he attempts to malign inquiry into the assassination of President Kennedy as ''one of the left's more wrongheaded crusades.''"

And when they get distracted, like anyone else stuck in an office, they surf the Web. Their own particular fetish is videos, and among their favorites -- no surprise -- has a ''Star Wars'' theme. It is an animated short from ''Robot Chicken,'' the series created by Seth Green and Matthew Senreich for the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block. In it the evil emperor Palpatine receives a weepy phone call from Darth Vader after the Death Star is destroyed. Only the emperor's (heavily bleeped) portion of the conversation is audible as he learns that his battle station has been blown up by a band of meddlesome teenagers.

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Consider this the next time you're tweaking your fantasy baseball lineup: you are part of an intellectual revolution. A minor revolution, perhaps, somewhat less ambitious than the call to arms described in ''Moneyball,'' but a revolution all the same. With every hour you spend ''managing'' your fantasy team, with every moment spent devouring the literary output of experts like Ron Shandler, the fabled publisher of Baseball Forecaster, or Matthew Berry, a writer otherwise known as ''the Talented Mr. Roto,'' with every soul fiber you sink into fantasy baseball, you move one step closer to becoming a postmodern baseball fan. Makes you feel better, no? For three decades, fantasy baseball has been rightly called a despoiler of work and family life, with the only side benefit -- if you can call it that -- being an intimate familiarity with the backup catchers of the Milwaukee Brewers. But lately there seems to be a new elegance in the fantasy universe, a sort of native intelligence. As every baseball fan knows, fantasy has grown in both size -- 15 to 18 million people are now estimated to play some kind of fantasy sport -- and prestige. Open your local sports page and you are likely to find fantasy baseball treated with a reverence formerly reserved for ''real'' baseball. Instead of gazing at box scores, as they did in the 1980s, fans can go to Yahoo and ESPN.com for supercharged scoring. Fox has inserted fantasy statistics into its game-of-the-week broadcasts, and even crusty old Fenway Park puts the fantasy stat WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched) on a scoreboard. In baseball's fantasy era, we are beginning to see fans engaging in a metaphysical feat never thought possible: being a fan of fantasy baseball without being a fan of the game as it's played on the field."

Behind the News -- The world's highest mountain, at 29,028 feet, has also been called the world's highest garbage dump. Over the years, would-be summiteers have left behind tons of trash -- tents, oxygen bottles, pots, stoves and other junk, not to mention the corpses of dozens of climbers. The Japanese climber Ken Noguchi says his teams have hauled 19,800 pounds of garbage in five trips since 2000. This year, he says, ''the amount of waste left on the mountain has been drastically decreased.'' SPACE DEBRIS The News -- Two Russian cosmonauts erected protection panels on the International Space Station to shield it from space debris.

Scientists consider space debris, which includes discarded rocket parts and small rocks, to be the biggest threat to the space station, which orbits 220 miles above Earth. NASA says about 11,000 human-created objects larger than 10 centimeters -- about 4 inches -- are in orbit, plus another 100,000 particles between a centimeter and 10 centimeters in size. CALL IN THE BULLDOZERS The News -- Officials in India said Wednesday they are seeking developers to demolish the Dharavi slum in Mumbai, India's financial and entertainment capital.

''The new Repoxygen is hard to get,'' Springstein had written. ''Please give me new instructions soon so that I can order the product before Christmas.'' Until that day in the courtroom, Repoxygen was an obscure gene-therapy drug developed at a pharmaceutical lab in Oxford, England, to fight anemia. The lab shelved the product when it seemed unlikely to be profitable. Once it was mentioned in court in January 2006, however, Repoxygen vaulted to celebrity-drug status in Europe. Newspapers and Web sites ran dozens of stories about the imminent danger of the therapy. ''The moment that e-mail was presented in open court,'' a columnist wrote in the weekend paper Scotland on Sunday, was when the ''era of genetic doping . . . arrived.''"

What disturbs me most about Marshall's criticism, beyond the obvious, is the implication that she is sufficiently authoritative on the subject to make such a judgment. In fact, Marshall consistently reveals herself to know little or nothing of the period. No further proof is needed than her constant reference to the daughters of the Count of Provence as the ''Berenger sisters,'' a jaw-dropping whopper of an error that no historian even remotely acquainted with the Middle Ages would make. Raymond Berenger was a single appellation, akin to Jean-Louis. Jean-Louis's daughters wouldn't be called the ''Louis sisters.''"

Ms. Parks met Mr. Warren through one of her students; she is not a former Columbia classmate of Mr. Warren's. Also, a picture caption with the article referred imprecisely to the occupation of the three women shown with Susan Olsen, executive director of Friends of Woodlawn, who was on the left. The women are members of the library staff, not researchers. In addition, the article and a picture caption referred imprecisely to Isidor and Ida Straus's ownership of Macy's.

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Surf rivalries are generally rather tame affairs, but consider the opening salvo in the war between Ken Bradshaw and Mark Foo, as told in Andy Martin's new book, ''Stealing the Wave'' (Bloomsbury, $24.95). Bradshaw and Foo were the premier big-wave surfers at Hawaii's Waimea Bay, and one morning in the mid-1980s, Foo ''dropped in'' on Bradshaw -- meaning he co-opted his wave. Bradshaw flew into a De Niro-esque rage -- You're dropping in on me? -- and exacted his revenge by clotheslining Foo and taking a bite out of his favorite surfboard. It makes charging the mound seem tame by comparison. Bradshaw and Foo spent a decade snarling at each other, with casual slights in surfing magazines and confrontations at the beach. Martin describes Waimea in its pretourist state as a place of rigid social codes, where surfers enforced the decorum and a proper pecking order. And as he pushes toward the story's tragic finale (Foo died while surfing at California's infamous Maverick's break while Bradshaw bobbed in the water nearby), Martin manages to make the two men seem like they're battling not only for the hearts and minds of Brazilian groupies but for the fate of big-wave surfing itself. When hate seeps through the sunbaked haze of Hawaii, it is something truly majestic to behold."

On May 4, 1963, Bob Shaw of the Milwaukee Braves tied the record for the most balks in an inning with three and set the record for balks in a game with five. Hot Hand John Lackey of the Angels (9-3, 2.37 earned run average) is scheduled to start against the Twins on Wednesday. Lackey has won his last five starts. Rookie Watch Troy Tulowitzki of the Rockies leads all rookies with 53 base hits. Colorado will be home against the Astros for a series that begins Tuesday. Streak on the Line Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak on Friday to 25 games, a Mariners record. It is the sixth time in his career that he has hit safely in 20 or more straight games. Three other active players have at least three streaks of 20 or more games: Nomar Garciaparra of the Dodgers (five), Vladimir Guerrero of the Angels (three) and Manny RamÍrez of the Red Sox (three). Milestone Tracker Frank Thomas is five home runs from 500 and one from 244 as a designated hitter, which would break Edgar Martinez's record. Toronto will be home for a three-game set against Tampa Bay beginning Tuesday, then goes on the road against the Dodgers and the Giants. PLAYERS TO WATCH Chone Figgins, below, might have gotten the message. Figgins, the Angels' starting third baseman, was hitting .133 last week when Erick Aybar, a highly regarded prospect who is normally a middle infielder, started at third. Figgins, after having two days off, collected three hits and stole two bases. Aybar was 0 for 4 in his first start at third and is batting just .252. Figgins has long been the Angels' spark plug and figures to remain a regular. Jorge Julio, Byung-Hyun Kim and now Armando Benítez. The Marlins have a thing for frustrated closers. But Benítez, in addition to having a hittable fastball and an inclination to implode, is also dealing with a knee problem. The team's current closer, Kevin Gregg, should not have to look over his shoulder, unless, of course, it is to worry about the previous closer, Henry Owens, who came off the disabled list Thursday. Robinson Canó has struggled along with many of his Yankees teammates, batting .264 through the first two months. But Canó likes the warm weather. He has batted .273 in April and May in his career, then .333 the rest of the season. Canó started June with a homer against Boston's Tim Wakefield. Statistics through Friday night.

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"If you saw Lauryn Williams on the street, you wouldn't think she was the reigning world champion in the 100-meter sprint. But the 5-foot-3, 127-pound Williams has always been faster than bigger, taller athletes; in elementary school, she outran boys five and six years her senior. ''That's when I started to know I had talent,'' the 23-year-old Williams says. At 20, she won the silver medal in the 100-meter dash at the 2004 Athens Olympics. The next year she earned gold at the World Championships, a title she'll defend this August in Osaka, Japan. So how is it that someone so small can run so fast? STRIDE FREQUENCY Because she had short legs and an unorthodox technique, Williams wasn't heavily recruited out of high school. But the women's track coach at the University of Miami, Amy Deem, saw her potential. The two have worked together ever since. ''She had frequency,'' Deem says, referring to Williams's high stride rate. Most elite female sprinters take about 4.6 steps per second; Williams takes 4.9. What separates Williams from the pack is her ability to get her feet off the ground quickly. ''The difference between not making the Olympic team in the sprints and making the team is a ground time of less than a hundredth of a second,'' says Ralph Mann, who studies runners' biomechanics for USA Track and Field. Williams reminds Mann of five-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Johnson. ''The coaches call them freaks,'' Mann says, ''because their turnover is simply out there.'' EXPLOSIVE FORCE ''If I want to decrease my ground time, I want to get very, very powerful so I can explode off the ground,'' Mann says. So in the off-season, Williams builds strength. Squats and bench presses prepare her to burst out of the blocks and drive through each step. As the season approaches, she shifts to lighter weights to work on quickness. Her muscles, like those of most speed athletes, have a high percentage of fast-twitch fibers, which contract the muscles faster. ''The slow-twitch fibers take longer to reach their peak tension, whereas the faster ones can peak really fast,'' says Dr. Bob Adams, the head of USA Track and Field's sports medicine and science committee. NEUROMUSCULAR EFFICIENCY Power is only a starting point. What's essential is ''the coordination of the firing of muscles at the right time in the right order in the right pattern,'' says Lisa Kearns, Williams's physical therapist. In a sport where hundredths of a second separate the best athletes from average ones, runners must have flawless technique and perfect balance. ''The center of the body must be stable so there isn't wasted motion,'' Kearns adds. ''The more they're able to stabilize through their pelvis and their core, the more efficiently the legs will respond to the messages being sent by the brain.'' When Williams was younger, she ran in an inefficient crouch. ''She didn't have a lot of what a track coach would call 'front-side mechanics,' '' Deem says. ''Her hips were rotated back, she was leaning forward when she ran and everything was happening behind her.'' Deem taught her to stand up straighter and keep her center of mass in line with her hips. This has lengthened her stride. ''We've shifted her hips underneath her,'' Deem says, ''so that she can bring the knee and the leg through in a better range of motion.'' SPEED ENDURANCE Even the best sprinters in the world slow down during the last 10 to 15 meters of the 100-meter dash. They just decelerate less than their competitors do. Williams trains at longer distances to develop stamina. The 100, she says, seems easy after sprinting for 250 meters: ''That's far. I call it the marathon.'' Most sprinters are now so specialized that they have trouble at different distances. OVERDRIVE None of this matters, though, without the requisite mental toughness, which would seem like a given but isn't. A sprinter's ''talent is very fragile, and it requires tremendous dedication,'' says Ralph Vernacchia, a performance consultant who has worked with the United States Olympic track team. ''Williams is the kind of athlete who thrives on the big-race.'' Deem says, ''She's, very competitive, and that's what sets her apart in a lot of ways.'' Well, that and pride. ''My thing at the Olympics was, I would be on national TV,'' Williams says. ''I just couldn't beout there losing with everybody in the whole country watching.''"

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"WHEN my parents moved us from a cramped apartment in an aging industrial city out to a raw new development in the suburbs, it seemed like Disney's Frontierland -- without Uncle Walt's thoughtful amenities. Dad took the Chevy to work, so the rest of us walked everywhere at first. The nearest loaf of bread was about a mile away. My mother adored her new pink ranch with the blue-tiled bathroom, but she missed the corner store and her sisters a short walk away. In a weak moment, as we struggled toward town against a mean November wind with my little brother, she yelled into the gale, ''How do people live here?'' A generation later, as my husband and I moved back out from Manhattan, two wee ones in tow, I understood her discomfiture. I knew the lay of the land; I'd grown up in the adjacent town. But, staring at a local newspaper listing announcing napkin-folding classes, not possessed of sufficient bonhomie for Newcomers Club sock hops, I howled, too: Where can you get a bottle of decent Vietnamese fish sauce? Why are they still selling -- and wearing -- the lime green golf slacks embossed with spouting whales that I hooted at in high school?"

''Jay Leno called us 37 times,'' says Strel's son, Borut, who manages his swimming expeditions, ''but we had appointments in Slovenia.'' But not today. Fifteen days after climbing out of the Amazon in Belém, Brazil, where he was promptly loaded into an ambulance for a ride to a local hospital (''with blood pressure at near heart attack levels,'' his official Web site reported), Strel and Borut are in Los Angeles, sipping red wine with a documentary filmmaker at a yellow-walled Italian restaurant in Marina del Rey. The filmmaker and his crew were with Strel for every stroke of his journey from Atalaya, Peru, to the Amazon's mouth, shooting a documentary, ''Big River Man,'' which is now being edited. Strel and Borut are in California to help with the editing, to brush up Strel's English in preparation for the film's publicity tour (and, they hope, a string of speaking engagements) and to field calls from the news media.

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"To surf, a small verb lacking filigree or urgency, belongs to magical realism as much as to sport. Hawaiians, who were perhaps the first surfers, prayed for good conditions and venerated those who could truly harness a wave. Mark Twain wrote rapturously of his first encounter with surfing, watching a native Hawaiian ''face the shore and wait for a particularly prodigious billow to come along; at the right moment he would fling his board upon its foamy crest and himself upon the board, and here he would come whizzing by like a bombshell!'' When people started to explore the Internet, which promised endless possibility to anyone with a computer, they called it surfing. The magic and the promise aren't quite so sunny in the newest series from HBO, ''John From Cincinnati,'' which makes its debut on June 10, right after the final episode of ''The Sopranos.'' Despite being set in the Southern California surfing scene, the show is less about mastering the waves than surviving amid them. The first episode is filled with conflicts, scams, addiction and corruption, all familiar concerns to anyone who knows the work of its executive producer, David Milch, who created ''NYPD Blue'' and, more recently, ''Deadwood.'' And there are the usual compelling sidebars and memorable characters -- a lawyer named Dickstein, a retired cop who looks after birds and humans, gangsters in beach casual."

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"IN those final weeks before summer vacation, when temperatures can soar into the 90s, parents at 5 of Greenwich's 11 elementary schools without adequate air-conditioning could no longer watch their children wilt, along with the crayons, in the heat. So they approached the school board and air-conditioning was installed -- but not at the expense of property taxpayers; the parents raised the money. Students in two other elementary schools in town, without the same deep-pocketed parents, had to wait, however. They were finally granted air-conditioning after town officials squeezed the upgrades into capital budgets financed by taxpayers."

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Few projects have seemed better suited to a network's mission than ''ARMY WIVES'' does to Lifetime's. The dramatic series (Sunday at 10 p.m.) focuses on military spouses, the sisterhood they form, the challenges they face. One wife struggles with a problematic teenager, another with the prospect of financial ruin. In their midst is a husband, a psychiatrist dealing with the return of his wife from service in Afghanistan. Fear not that this borders on the too serious. ''Army Wives'' comes from Mark Gordon, the executive producer of ''Grey's Anatomy,'' and will feel no less soap operatic. Apparently the ''Entourage'' star ADRIAN GRENIER has been living a soap opera of his own. Raised by a single mother, Mr. Grenier discovered as an adult that she had been dating two men at the time of his conception. His documentary ''SHOT IN THE DARK'' (Sunday, 10:30 p.m., HBO) chronicles his search for his biological father, who, he finds, is living in Lancaster, Ohio. Like ''Flirting With Disaster'' and other films, ''Shot in the Dark'' uses the road trip as a metaphor for self-discovery. If the notion of a road trip just leaves you feeling hungry, rest assured, a new season of ''THE NEXT FOOD NETWORK STAR'' begins Sunday at 9 p.m. What will happen now? Well, apparently the contestants, competing for their own show on the network, will be forced to leave the studio and venture into the world outside. One challenge will have them creating food for a basketball game. During her lifetime Ella Fitzgerald collected 13 Grammy Awards. More than 40 million copies of her albums have been sold.

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Once a year, professional golfers are faced with a course that makes them look like mortals. The United States Open is the sport's four-day stress test, a marathon of frayed nerves, gnashed teeth and shocking scores. (Just ask Phil Mickelson.) Mike Davis of the United States Golf Association is charged with preparing this year's Open -- to be held this month at Oakmont, near Pittsburgh -- just as he was last year at Winged Foot. Playing in his 13th Open, Jim Furyk, the 2003 champion, will try to survive the ordeal. Here, the two men discuss some peculiarities of golf's toughest tournament. A WHOLE NEW MIND-SET The United States Open is golf at its most counterintuitive. Though length off the tee and a willingness to take risks are the tools that win your typical PGA Tour tournament, the Open rewards accuracy and patience. A desire to take dead aim at the flagstick must be tamped down in favor of shooting for the center of the green. The season-long quest for birdies must be replaced by a yearning for par -- not to mention an acceptance of bogeys."
2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"If everything proceeds as planned - not that it ever does - late on the afternoon of July 7, in the Mediterranean waters fronting the ancient Spanish city of Valencia, one middle-aged man's $100 million, four-year-long campaign to win the America's Cup will explode in his face. Precisely to whom this will occur has yet to be decided. Word along the waterfront identifies several good candidates. Larry Ellison, the billionaire software magnate behind the American entry, BMW Oracle, is a popular choice. Another is Patrizio Bertelli, the head of the Italian effort and the C.E.O. of the design house Prada, his boats's main sponsor. Then there is Ernesto Bertarelli, an elegant 41-year-old billionaire from Geneva who is the current holder of the Cup, which his team, Alinghi, wrested away from New Zealand in 2003. One man happily exempt from this specter of sudden heartsick, however, is Xavier de Lesquen, a former French naval officer who, as the executive manager of China Team, oversees that nation's fledgling effort to win the oldest trophy in sports. Cup dreams tend to sour swiftly, with stunning, tearful finality, and it is considered bad juju to prognosticate. Even so, several outcomes are already certain. By the time you read this, China Team will have taken its lumps and been eliminated from the competition, transforming de Lesquen's role from that of participant to interested observer. China's departure will have surprised no one, not even de Lesquen. The campaign started tardily and was woefully underfunded; for every dollar that a superteam like Alinghi or BMW Oracle had to spend, China had only a dime. Lacking the wherewithal to build a team from scratch, the Chinese absorbed a French team, taking possession of most of its assets. These included an America's Cup-class racing yacht, a support staff, several French crew members and de Lesquen. Because China is home to few world-class yachtsmen -- and those who might be said to qualify were focused on the Beijing Olympics -- it took some effort to assemble the 17-man crew required to sail an America's Cup yacht. Officials of the Chinese Yachting Association fanned out across the country and plucked unsuspecting sailors from provincial teams. After congratulating the young men for having achieved their theretofore unknown dream of competing in an America's Cup, the officials hustled them off to Valencia, where they bivouacked in communal flats and communicated with their teammates, who are primarily French, via translators. ''I think our Chinese friends are a little bit homesick, yes,'' de Lesquen admitted when I visited Spain in April. ''It's a very strange thing for them.''"
2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"GELSEY KIRKLAND's celebrated and troubled career began at the New York City Ballet and continued at American Ballet Theater, where she formed a celebrated partnership with Mikhail Baryshnikov. Her last role, in 1987, was Aurora in ''Sleeping Beauty,'' which she danced to immense acclaim with the Royal Ballet in London. This week Ms. Kirkland, one of the leading ballerinas of her generation, is returning to the stage with AMERICAN BALLET THEATER in the same ballet. This time she will play the wicked fairy Carabosse, whose revengeful fury propels the narrative. Ms. Kirkland, who also staged this production along with Kevin McKenzie and Michael Chernov, was famous for her meticulous, often obsessive approach to preparing her roles. Here is another chance to watch a great artist work her magic. Monday at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 2 p.m., Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, abt.org; $24 to $110. A new work by CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON is always an occasion unto itself, but his ''Nightingale and the Rose,'' for the New York City Ballet, where he is the resident choreographer, will also be the premiere of the first commissioned score from Bright Sheng, the company's resident composer. The ballet, based on Oscar Wilde's poignant story, features the wonderful Wendy Whelan alongside Sara Mearns and Tyler Angle, two of the company's most promising juniors. There's never any guarantee that two luminous talents like Mr. Wheeldon and Mr. Sheng will burn brighter together, but the possibility is a compelling one. Friday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycb.org; $15 to $82. Not content with being a ballet legend, having his own arts center, and commissioning and dancing in contemporary work for his touring groups (to say nothing of acting and taking photographs), MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV has found time to write a children's book. Charmingly illustrated by Vladimir Radunsky, ''Because,'' which just arrived in bookstores, tells of an irrepressible Granny who loves to dance.

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Was there ever a golf moment at once more horrific and more riveting than Phil Mickelson's meltdown on the final hole of last year's United States Open at Winged Foot Golf Club? You couldn't watch, and at the same time you couldn't not watch. Not to dwell on painful memories, but some traumas won't go away. Here was the new, reformed Phil, the one who had supposedly curbed his appetite for risky, all-or-nothing shots, coming off victories at the P.G.A. Championship and the Masters. A victory at Winged Foot would make him just the second golfer in 50 years to claim three majors in a row and would erase once and for all his reputation for poor decisions under fire, for being the kind of golfer who once caused Jack Nicklaus to say, ''Phil's a nice player, he's a good player, but he's not a great champion.''"
2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"By my count only two Italian films received commercial openings in New York in the first five months of this year, and one of them -- Alberto Lattuada's ''Mafioso'' -- was 45 years old. (The other, Emanuele Crialese's ''Golden Door,'' snuck in under the wire, on May 25.) Which is further evidence, as if any were needed, that festivals like the Film Society of Lincoln Center's OPEN ROADS: NEW ITALIAN CINEMA are more valuable than ever. The 13-movie series opens Wednesday with a big name, Mario Monicelli, who was already in his 40s when he made ''Big Deal on Madonna Street'' in 1958; he's 92 now, and his latest film, ''Desert Roses'' (''Le Rose del Deserto''), is yet another social satire, this time involving an Italian medical unit in Africa in World War II that's not entirely clear on how the war is going. Other films include ''The Unknown Woman'' (''La Sconosciuta''), a thriller about a Ukrainian immigrant to Italy directed by Giuseppe Tornatore (''Cinema Paradiso''); Angelo Longoni's biopic ''Caravaggio,'' photographed by the great Vittorio Storaro and starring Alessio Boni, who played the younger brother in ''The Best of Youth''; and ''Primo Levi's Journey'' (''La Strada di Levi''), a documentary that retraces the tortuous route Levi had to take to return home from Auschwitz in 1945. An older -- and lighter -- European sensibility can be sampled on Tuesday at the French Institute/Alliance Française, where the nine-week series THE SURREAL DELICACY OF RENÉ CLAIR begins with a screening of Clair's Dada comedy ''Entr'acte'' (1924), made with the painter Francis Picabia and the composer Eric Satie; Satie's score will be performed live by Bruce Levingston. Future Tuesdays will feature Clair classics like ''À Nous la liberté'' and ''Le Million,'' along with more rarely seen items like the silent short ''Paris Qui Dort'' and several of his English-language films."

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"WHEN my mother reached her mid-80s, it began to dawn on me that I'd have to start intervening in her life. This was not pleasant. Mom had always been fiercely independent, happily living on her own in suburban Boston for the 20 years after my dad died. There was no single event, just a hundred little ones that nibbled away at that solid image of Mom that was stored in my brain. I'd go back to Quincy for a visit and there would be piles of mail all over the house. Overdue bills were mixed in with supermarket stuffers that should have been tossed out weeks earlier. And I'd try to remember: Was this new?"

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"LAWRENCE WRIGHT told you so. He is too polite to put it that way of course. But anyone who saw ''The Siege,'' the 1998 film he helped write about a wave of terrorist bombings in New York City, knows that he was prescient about many things. After Sept. 11, Mr. Wright, a writer for The New Yorker, thought the tragedy was familiar. ''This looks like my movie,'' he said in ''My Trip to Al-Qaeda,'' a fascinating slide show and monologue that had a six-week run this spring. The play is based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ''The Looming Tower,'' which was the product of more than 600 interviews, many with terrorists. The show closed in April, but there are two more chances to see it this week, when Mr. Wright returns for encore performances at Town Hall. On Tuesday there will be a post-show talk moderated by Aziz Huq, the director of the Liberty and National Security Project at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. On Wednesday the post-show moderator is David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com; $25 and $40. For those who want to forget about terror threats and enjoy ''Summer's ripening breath,'' as Shakespeare puts it, the Public Theater begins its Delacorte Theater season with that romantic old story about Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet. OSCAR ISAAC, who starred in the Central Park production of ''Two Gentlemen of Verona'' in 2005, will do his best to charm the red-headed beauty LAUREN AMBROSE, who played the moody Claire on the HBO series ''Six Feet Under.'' Michael Greif (''Rent'') directs this crowd-pleaser, which hasn't been produced in Central Park since 1968, when it starred Martin Sheen as Romeo. That's surprising since the play can be lovely to watch outdoors. When Romeo swears by the moon, why, there it is. Previews start Tuesday at 8 p.m., Delacorte Theater, Central Park, (212) 539-8500, publictheater.org."

While a parent said the suspensions were for remarks about the school's nuns that students posted on the Internet, the principal, Sister Maria Dolorosa, said the students were suspended because they used the Internet to view movies and listen to music that they knew were prohibited by the school."

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"WHEN my parents moved us from a cramped apartment in an aging industrial city out to a raw new development in the suburbs, it seemed like Disney's Frontierland -- without Uncle Walt's thoughtful amenities. Dad took the Chevy to work, so the rest of us walked everywhere at first. The nearest loaf of bread was about a mile away. My mother adored her new pink ranch with the blue-tiled bathroom, but she missed the corner store and her sisters a short walk away. In a weak moment, as we struggled toward town against a mean November wind with my little brother, she yelled into the gale, ''How do people live here?'' A generation later, as my husband and I moved back out from Manhattan, two wee ones in tow, I understood her discomfiture. I knew the lay of the land; I'd grown up in the adjacent town. But, staring at a local newspaper listing announcing napkin-folding classes, not possessed of sufficient bonhomie for Newcomers Club sock hops, I howled, too: Where can you get a bottle of decent Vietnamese fish sauce? Why are they still selling -- and wearing -- the lime green golf slacks embossed with spouting whales that I hooted at in high school?"

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Bill Hambrecht is a rich old Wall Street guy who has made his money tilting at windmills and disrupting the establishment. ''That's what I do,'' he says. ''It's fun.'' Almost a decade ago, at 62, he founded WR Hambrecht + Company, whose fundamental premise is that companies don't need to use Wall Street investment bankers -- and pay their outrageous fees -- to go public. Hambrecht + Company has since become so threatening to traditional underwriters that they often refuse to be involved in any I.P.O. in which his firm takes part. And now, at an age when most people are well into retirement, he has decided to tackle the establishment again. This time, though, the establishment isn't Wall Street. It's the National Football League. Bill Hambrecht, you see, is starting up a professional football league. So far, he and his partner, Tim Armstrong, a senior executive at Google, have pledged $2 million each. They've hired a C.E.O. and a C.O.O., both of whom cut their teeth at the National Basketball Association. They've got a name: the United Football League. And they've lined up a wealthy, well-known businessman as their first owner: Mark Cuban, the billionaire who owns the N.B.A.'s Dallas Mavericks. Like Hambrecht, Cuban loves nothing more than confronting the status quo."

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"IN most years, Rick Porcello, the 2007 Gatorade National Baseball Player of the Year, would have no equal as a high school player. He is a big, right-handed pitcher, a senior at Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, N.J., who throws faster than most pros and whose route to the major leagues could be a short one. It is rare for a high school player from the Northeast to be thought of so highly. But this season, an unusual one for high school baseball talent in the region, there may be someone even better than Porcello."
2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: We were thrilled to see your coverage of two books of photographs -- ''New York Rises'' and ''A Living Lens'' -- that are related to exhibitions on view at the Museum of the City of New York, although your article (''The City, Framed: Jewish Life, Soaring Bridges, Fulton Market,'' Reading New York, May 27) mentioned only one of the companion exhibitions."
2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Because of an editing error, an article today on Page 12 of the special Tony Awards section of Arts & Leisure about indelible moments on Broadway omits, in some copies, several words in the first two paragraphs of an item on ''The Coast of Utopia.'' The passage should read: As the second act opened of ''Voyage,'' the beginning of Tom Stoppard's trilogy, ''The Coast of Utopia,'' the season's most visually sublime moment came into full view. We were in Moscow now, in March of 1834, having left the idyll of Premukhino, the Bakunin family estate, a place of long meals, pastoral languor. '' 'For happiness, apparently, something of the real world is necessary,' '' Ivan Turgenev had told us in the previous scene, quoting another character. And now indeed we were in the world, in a city full of bustle and fervor."

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Several museum shows are opening this week, offering viewers everything from monumental sculptures to early American rugs. Perhaps the most anticipated of them is the RICHARD SERRA retrospective that begins Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art. Spanning 40 years of his career and filling the museum as well as its sculpture garden, the show features some of his early experiments with materials like rubber and neon as well as the giant, labyrinthlike steel sculptures that have become his signature. Among the best known of the large works is ''Intersection II,'' a 60-ton sculpture made of four two-inch-thick gentle curves of hot rolled steel, and ''Torqued Ellipse IV,'' a 46-ton sculpture that is a twisted ribbon in the shape of an ellipse standing on its edge. Both are from the Modern's own collection. The show will also feature three new works. Through Sept. 10, moma.org. Next door, opening on Tuesday at the Folk Art Museum, is ''The Great Cover-Up: American Rugs on Beds, Tables and Floors,'' a show devoted to early American rugs. On view will be about 65 rugs dating from the end of the 18th century through the mid-20th century. Through Sept. 9, 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, folkartmuseum.org. A peek at one of the greatest libraries of Renaissance Italy will be the subject of ''FEDERICO DA MONTEFELTRO AND HIS LIBRARY,'' an exhibition opening Thursday at the Morgan Library & Museum. Montefeltro, or the Duke of Urbino, was, fittingly, a true Renaissance man, fascinated with everything from theology to poetry. In addition to portraits and illuminated manuscripts, the exhibition will include the duke's horoscope of 1475 (on loan from the Beinecke Library at Yale University), which shows his interest in astrology, and a coded letter of 1478 that documents his secret military involvement in an attempted coup against the Medici in Florence. The duke's library will be recreated in the 20-square-foot, cube-shaped gallery that the Italian architect Renzo Piano designed after Renaissance chambers. Through Sept. 30, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, morganlibrary.org."

PEDJA MUZIJEVIC, the pianist who runs the series, has been able to lure several first-class soloists and ensembles, often for programs that move off the beaten path.

LEON BOTSTEIN'S AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA closes its season Sunday with a program devoted to music by Shostakovich and his lesser-known contemporary and friend Mieczyslaw Weinberg. Weinberg was born in Warsaw and moved to the Soviet Union to escape the Nazis in 1939 but was imprisoned by Stalin in the 1950s. Shostakovich, who admired Weinberg's First Symphony, helped get him released. Mr. Botstein is conducting two large works by Weinberg, the Symphony No. 6 (he wrote 26 of them) and the Trumpet Concerto. Shostakovich is represented by his Symphony No. 13, with its searing setting of Yevgeny Yevtushenko's ''Babi Yar.'' Carl Albach is the soloist in the concerto; the bass-baritone Sergei Leiferkus is the soloist in the Shostakovich; and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus and the Concert Chorale of New York perform in the symphonies. 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $27 to $55."

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"FROM the stacks of allergy medicine at Duane Reade to the students ''doing homework'' at the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, it's clear that spring has overtaken New York. Which means it's time for apartment owners to come together in their annual meetings and debate what to do to the spaces they have the fortune, or misfortune, to share. The owners who paid the most for their apartments are usually the first ones to argue for upgrades so their buildings do not lag behind newer condos, and so they can live in a style commensurate with a seven- or eight-figure purchase price."
2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''Not Your Mom's Prom?,'' by Kate Stone Lombardi (Generations, May 27): I was dismayed on Memorial Day weekend to read that only in the 1970s, during and after the Vietnam War, did high school students feel a certain sadness about the war and trim down their prom excesses. Wow! That is really sending the wrong message. Even in the most privileged of communities -- my hometown, Greenwich, Conn. -- prom night is a more laid-back affair. There are only a few limos, and many private schools have bans on such grandiose extras. Parties before and after are discouraged, in order to discourage drinking and driving."
2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"IN those final weeks before summer vacation, when temperatures can soar into the 90s, parents at 5 of Greenwich's 11 elementary schools without adequate air-conditioning could no longer watch their children wilt, along with the crayons, in the heat. So they approached the school board and air-conditioning was installed -- but not at the expense of property taxpayers; the parents raised the money. Students in two other elementary schools in town, without the same deep-pocketed parents, had to wait, however. They were finally granted air-conditioning after town officials squeezed the upgrades into capital budgets financed by taxpayers."

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"WHEN my mother reached her mid-80s, it began to dawn on me that I'd have to start intervening in her life. This was not pleasant. Mom had always been fiercely independent, happily living on her own in suburban Boston for the 20 years after my dad died. There was no single event, just a hundred little ones that nibbled away at that solid image of Mom that was stored in my brain. I'd go back to Quincy for a visit and there would be piles of mail all over the house. Overdue bills were mixed in with supermarket stuffers that should have been tossed out weeks earlier. And I'd try to remember: Was this new?"

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"WHEN my parents moved us from a cramped apartment in an aging industrial city out to a raw new development in the suburbs, it seemed like Disney's Frontierland -- without Uncle Walt's thoughtful amenities. Dad took the Chevy to work, so the rest of us walked everywhere at first. The nearest loaf of bread was about a mile away. My mother adored her new pink ranch with the blue-tiled bathroom, but she missed the corner store and her sisters a short walk away. In a weak moment, as we struggled toward town against a mean November wind with my little brother, she yelled into the gale, ''How do people live here?'' A generation later, as my husband and I moved back out from Manhattan, two wee ones in tow, I understood her discomfiture. I knew the lay of the land; I'd grown up in the adjacent town. But, staring at a local newspaper listing announcing napkin-folding classes, not possessed of sufficient bonhomie for Newcomers Club sock hops, I howled, too: Where can you get a bottle of decent Vietnamese fish sauce? Why are they still selling -- and wearing -- the lime green golf slacks embossed with spouting whales that I hooted at in high school?"

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Sue Cox says that her 17-year-old son, Tim, ''started playing sports practically in the womb.'' A standout on junior-league basketball and Pop Warner football teams in Hudson, N.H., he was, by high school, among the top basketball players in the state as well as a starting safety on the football team. ''I lived for sports, you could say,'' Tim says. But could he also have died from them? Last July, at his parents' insistence, Cox had an electrocardiogram, which measures electrical activity in the heart. It's the same test his father had 15 years ago, after experiencing some shortness of breath. That EKG and follow-up tests showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a thickening of the heart muscle. Cox's grandfather had been diagnosed with the same condition and died at age 63. But Cox, with the insouciance of youth, was sure that his own heart was fine. He was therefore stunned when the test came back positive. He would never be allowed to play competitive sports again, his cardiologist told him flatly. ''It was a terrible time,'' says Cox's father, also named Tim. ''We wanted to keep our son alive, but to do that, we were taking away everything that he loved most in life.''"

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"If you think you have a dorky hobby, imagine spending several hours a week waiting for a Web site to play simulated baseball games. Then imagine that the teams were constructed using the statistics of nearly every player who has ever played pro baseball, going back to 1885, the vast majority of whom you've never heard of. The games are simulated three times a day, so that a season takes about two months. You're now imagining one of my hobbies. Suddenly your own doesn't seem so dorky anymore, does it? One afternoon a couple of years ago, I followed a link on Major League Baseball's home page and found myself at whatifsports.com, which informed me that within minutes I could be playing SimLeague Baseball, managing a team that included Ichiro Suzuki and Steve Balboni. Commingling those particular greatnesses had never been a dream of mine. I already played regular fantasy baseball, which involves tracking the day-to-day statistics of currently active baseball players. That was time-consuming enough, to the point where it occasionally created tension in my marriage, but this was a more insidious beast, and I sensed its destructive potential. Nonetheless, I was curious. I plunged in. Soon, I was gazing upon baseball-nerd heaven."

With companies from the American cruising giants to boutique lines that specialize in river and Arctic itineraries expanding their presence throughout the Continent, European cruise capacity is expected to increase 23 percent this summer over last, according to Cruise Industry News, with an additional 10 percent more growth predicted for next year. Fueling the rise is a combination of consumer demand and cruising's unanticipated status as a vacation value option this summer. ''There are more ships out there than ever before, and companies have to put them where they will earn a strong return,'' said Henry Harteveldt, chief travel analyst at Forrester Research in San Francisco."

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"DUMPSTAPHUNK is the best funk band from New Orleans right now. That's no small thing in a city where rhythm is a natural resource, an art, an advanced science, an incantation and an exorcism as well as a reason to dance. IVAN NEVILLE, the keyboardist who leads Dumpstaphunk, has a funk pedigree. His father is Aaron Neville of the Neville Brothers, which also includes Art Neville of the Meters, the definitive 1960s and 1970s New Orleans funk band. Ivan himself was a longtime member of the Neville Brothers, and like them he sees no reason not to mix messages with a dance beat. Dumpstaphunk follows through on the Meters' and Neville Brothers' snickering, sputtering, wah-wah New Orleans funk, and onstage it charges through songs from Sly Stone and Creedence Clearwater Revival. But Dumpstaphunk is no oldies act. It has new songs that push the New Orleans heritage into the post-Katrina era. ''Ugly Truth,'' ''Meanwhile'' and ''Livin' in a World Gone Mad'' -- all at myspace.com/dumpstaphunk -- are powered by rage and humor as well as rhythm, which doesn't make them any less danceable. Friday at 11 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $15 in advance, $17 Friday. Funk and hard-headed social consciousness also meet in the music of EL-P.

Party chants and drugs-and-bling boasts are not for him; he sees trouble in the streets and around the world. His second solo album, ''I'll Sleep When You're Dead'' (Definitive Jux), is sonically dense and verbally pugnacious: ''Either speak the truth or you leave toothless,'' he warns.

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In ''Newark Battles Murder and Its Accomplice, Silence'' (''The Hard Part'' series, front page, May 27), you paint a stereotype of minorities, drugs, crime, troubled families and hopelessness.

I see individuals from the city and the surrounding suburbs working together to establish a cultural identity, building homes and businesses."
2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''Illegal Immigrants and Their Employers'' (letter, May 27) criticizes both workers who break the law by entering this country and those who break the law by hiring them. Such widespread violation often occurs when a law is unjust, unenforceable or so poorly conceived that the practical and human considerations come to outweigh the legislative ones."

Supposedly able to tone and trim legs, burn calories, absorb shock and improve posture with their patented ''microwobbleboard'' sole, FitFlops have flapped their way from England, where 18,000 pairs sold out within three days of their May release. (Two women actually got into a brawl over the last pair of size 7s at the London store Running Bare.) While a waiting list of 15,000 still exists in Britain, Americans can now buy FitFlops in red or black at bathandbodyworks.com for $39.95 -- no fisticuffs required."
2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"The Parenting column last Sunday, about a seventh-grade handwriting champion at a Roman Catholic school, St. Pius V, in Melville, gave an incomplete account of the circumstances surrounding the suspensions of several students last year. While a parent said the suspensions were for remarks about the school's nuns that students posted on the Internet, the principal, Sister Maria Dolorosa, said the students were suspended because they used the Internet to view movies and listen to music that they knew were prohibited by the school."
2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Josephine Baker wasn't the first young woman to shake a scantily clad brown bottom for the music-hall audiences of Paris during the Roaring Twenties. Chorus girls of every make and model had been strutting up and down the stages of Montmartre for more than a decade by the time Baker hit the scene in 1925, and African-American writers and musicians had been arriving by the boatload since the war. Still, no other American entertainer -- male or female, black or white -- was ever to achieve as phenomenal a stardom as Baker. Her 50-year-long triumph was a sociocultural moment yet to be repeated. The story of how an untrained, unexceptionally talented 19-year-old black girl from Missouri managed to enthrall the capital city of Europe from the 1920s until her death in 1975 at 68 -- transforming herself into a world-renowned artist in the process -- is worth telling and retelling. After all, Baker traveled in the rarefied circles of 20th-century celebrity: Picasso, Le Corbusier, Colette, Langston Hughes, E. E. Cummings, Jean Cocteau and Ernest Hemingway were all admirers. Adolf Loos designed a house to showcase her body from every angle, and Alexander Calder created wire sculptures of her form. Among her benefactors were Princess Grace, the Pasha of Marrakesh and Juan and Eva Péron."

Powell's review of ''Einstein: His Life and Universe,'' by Walter Isaacson, and ''Einstein: A Biography,'' by JÃ1/4rgen Neffe (May 20). The most precious thing Einstein's example offers ''the rest of us'' -- us ordinary folk -- is assuredly not a ''taste'' of a ''cosmic religious sense'' or ''connectedness to universal truth''; it is, rather, a glimpse of the awesome beauty and wonder of a mind driven by intense curiosity, and an inspiration to protect and nurture the fragile gift of curiosity that is native to young minds. Einstein's genuine cosmic religious sense -- in sharp contrast to the counterfeits peddled by established religion and two-bit gurus alike -- grew directly from his passionate pursuit of the deepest possible understanding of the universe, and is wholly unimaginable without it.

2007-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Travel books can generally be divided into two categories. First there are the ones in which all the traveling is done in the journey to an intended destination, at which point the writer stays put. And then there are the books in which the writer never stops -- jetting, cycling, cruising or otherwise gamboling about -- often at breakneck, TGV speed. Miss Manners, a k a Judith Martin, is one of those who know where they like to go and don't deviate in their devotion. Her latest book, NO VULGAR HOTEL: The Desire and Pursuit of Venice (Norton, $24.95), takes its title from Henry James's novel ''The Wings of the Dove,'' whose heroine, Milly Theale, declares that in Venice she will stay in ''no vulgar hotel,'' but in ''some fine old rooms, wholly independent, for a series of months.'' As Martin puts it, ''Renting -- not necessarily a palace, but no vulgar hotel -- is also a requirement for savoring the living Venice'' and truly understanding the city. It's the only way, she explains, to reciprocate invitations and entertain the locals, essential aspects of pursuing friendships. (Even on vacation, she remains Miss Manners.)"

There was no single event, just a hundred little ones that nibbled away at that solid image of Mom that was stored in my brain.

Addie was a lover of mystery novels, golf and orchids, an enthusiastic amateur poet and a columnist for several local newsletters. But she will be best remembered as a devoted philanthropist who gave generously to her alma mater Wellesley College, to San Mateo County Hospital and to many other charitable organizations in and around San Mateo where she lived. She won multiple awards for her generosity in the Bay Area including an official recognition by the US House of Representatives in 1993. In 1970 she co-founded the Women's Recovery Association -the nations first residential treatment program for female recovering alcoholics. For several years she was a board member of the San Mateo County Medical Center for which she was a champion fund raiser, creating its annual bed race and parade. But she was always happier offering her services at the grassroots level rather than serving on boards and her legacy can be seen most clearly in The Keller Center for Family Violence Intervention. The Center opened in 2001 because of Addie's strong belief that something more needed to be done to break the pattern of domestic violence.

2007-06-04T00:00:00Z,"'Gone With the Wind' Goes Musical in London When April rolls around, Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, and Melanie and Ashley Wilkes should be singing and dancing at the New London Theater in the London's West End under the direction of Trevor Nunn in a musical adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1936 novel, ''Gone With the Wind.'' Music and lyrics will be by a newcomer, Margaret Martin, in her first work for musical theater; she is a sociologist by training and is working on two new plays. In a statement Mr. Nunn, former artistic director and chief executive of the Royal Shakespeare Company, said, ''Having now worked on adapting two vast novels for the stage, 'Nicholas Nickleby' and 'Les Misérables,' I am drawn to the challenge of telling Margaret Mitchell's epic story through words, music and the imaginative resources of the theater.'' The musical adaptation of ''Gone With the Wind'' will not be London's first; a version with a score by Harold Rome played at the Theater Royal Drury Lane in 1972. 'Pirates' Sails On Treasure beyond the wildest dreams of Henry Morgan, Blackbeard, Jean Lafitte or any other brigand who ever sailed the seven seas continued to swell the coffers of ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' on its second weekend in North American theaters. The swashbuckler starring Johnny Depp, right, and distributed under the Buena Vista flag, amassed an estimated $43.1 million to continue as the No. 1 film, according to the box-office tracking company Media by Numbers, bringing its domestic total to $216.5 million (although the weekend gross from 4,362 theaters, the same number as last week, represented a 62 percent falloff from the preceding week). Second place in the rankings went to a newcomer: ''Knocked Up'' (Universal), the Judd Apatow pregnancy comedy starring Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen, attracted $29.2 million. Third place rewarded another of the season's sequels, ''Shrek the Third'' (Paramount), which grossed $26.7 million to bring its total to $254.6 million in its third week in theaters. ''Mr. Brooks'' (MGM), starring Kevin Costner as a serial killer, took in $10 million to capture fourth place. Fifth place was occupied by yet another big-budget sequel, ''Spider-Man 3'' (Sony), which gathered $7.5 million for a five-week total of $318.2 million. Ford's Theater Renovations Ford's Theater in Washington, where Lincoln was shot, has been closed by the National Park Service for 18 months, The Associated Press reported. The closing will permit an $8.5 million renovation of the 144-year-old theater, including its first elevator, new restrooms, and improvements in its heating, air conditioning, lighting and sound systems, in part to improve access for the disabled. The theater was last renovated in the 1960s. 'West Side Story' Goes Gold A 50th-anniversary production of ''West Side Story'' will be presented at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris for four weeks beginning on Nov. 20.

Footnotes Bobby Short may be gone, but he's not forgotten. Beginning tomorrow night, Michael Feinstein and a succession of special guests will pay tribute to that sophisticated singer and pianist with ''Celebrating Bobby Short'' through June 16 at Feinstein's at Loews Regency.

Kevin Spacey and Vanessa Redgrave, along with performers from ''Frost/Nixon,'' ''Grey Gardens,'' ''Hairspray,'' ''Inherit the Wind,'' ''Jersey Boys,'' ''Legally Blonde,'' ''Mamma Mia!'' and ''Spring Awakening,'' are scheduled to appear on Wednesday at ''Stars in the Alley.'' The free outdoor concert, from 11 a.m. to about 12:30 p.m. in Shubert Alley, west of Broadway between 44th and 45th Streets, celebrates the 2006-7 Broadway season.

Although the stadium sells an average of just under 20,000 hot dogs a game, and ranks No. 1 among major league ballparks who responded to the questionnaire from the hot dog council, Shea does not lead all ballparks in sales. It trails Yankee Stadium, which sells about 30,000 a game but did not answer the survey. (A reader raised the issue after an article on May 11 about the introduction of Latin food at Yankee Stadium mentioned the higher figure for the Yankees.

2007-06-05T22:11:04Z,"Until recently, my craziest taxi ride occurred a few years ago in Newark, N.J. That escapade involved a shared taxi, a rear window being kicked out, me diving into the passenger footwell, and the cabbie attempting to run over the guy who'd just skipped paying fare.

There are superb Italian restaurants in Bangkok. Within a 15-minute walk of my apartment in the Langsuan area I can count more than a half-dozen. Thais have long had an affinity for Italian food and at some point over the past decade the number of high-end Italian restaurants reached a critical mass. It became profitable to fly in a whole range of meats and ingredients as varied as fresh mozzarella di bufala and Sorrento lemons (one chef insists that only lemons from southern Italy will do the trick for his Tagliatelle al Limone). This week a group of Italian chefs has banded together to put on what they are calling, ""The Splendor of Italian Cuisine."" I certainly agree with the concept. The festival, which is being held at 11 top Italian restaurants in the capital through June 10, has the faint whiff of a marketing gimmick. But I'm a sucker for gimmicks that involve risotto and prosciutto crudo. Biscotti, the Italian restaurant at the Four Seasons (Tel: +66 2 255 5443), offers a 6-course menu for 1,500 baht ($44). Other restaurants involved in the festival include La Scala at the Sukhothai hotel (Tel: +66 2 344 8888) Spasso at the Grande Hyatt Erawan (Tel: +66 2 254 12340) and Gianni's on Soi Tonson, near Central Chidlom department store (Tel: +66 2 252 1619)."

Although go-shops haven't tended to smoke out rival bidders (Triad Hospitals is an exception), an analyst at Prudential says he thinks ""other parties remain interested."" Among those that might peer through the go-shop window, according to Prudential's Inder Singh, is Alcatel-Lucent. Avaya, which sells telecommunications gear, was spun off from Lucent in 2000, so a deal between the two would be reunion of sorts."

2007-06-05T00:00:00Z,"Officials with the Adirondack Council, an environmental group, are lobbying to reverse planned reductions in the federal budget that would severely limit or eliminate several acid rain monitoring programs.

Two other programs that sample lakes and streams in the Adirondacks and other areas of the Northeast on an annual combined budget of less than $1 million would also be eliminated. Acid rain remains a serious problem in many parts of the country, but nowhere has it been more damaging than in the Adirondacks, where vast forests have been decimated and more than 500 lakes and ponds have been left unable to support many species of native fish. &#8220;Closing down, even for a few months, will wipe out 21 years of continuously collected scientific data,&#8221; Brian L.

The airline industry may be back in the black, but passengers are still seeing red, according to a Consumer Reports survey that will be published in its July issue. Over all, the industry’s average score for satisfaction is lower than the scores for hotels and rental car companies and “better only than such perennials of frustration as wireless carriers, cable TV operators and computer tech support,” the magazine reports. Here is how the top 18 major domestic airlines stacked up in customer satisfaction. JetBlue was rated best. Consumer Reports said the carrier’s numerous flight delays in mid-February “seem to have had little effect” on the survey. In descending order, the others are Midwest, Southwest, Frontier, Hawaiian, Aloha, Alaska, Spirit, Continental, AirTran, Delta, American, ATA, Northwest, American Eagle, United, and America West and US Air, which merged in 2005 and recently combined all operations. In the Consumer Reports survey on hotels, Ritz-Carlton, a Marriott luxury brand, was chosen as top in overall satisfaction, while Homewood Suites from Hilton and SpringHill Suites from Marriott were cited as “excellent values.” Ritz-Carlton was also ranked at the top of the Market Metrix hospitality index survey taken in the first quarter of 2007."

Odds Against Harry Potter British bookmakers are so certain that Harry Potter will die in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' that they have stopped taking bets on his fate, Bloomberg News reported yesterday. ''Every penny was on Harry dying, and it became untenable,'' said Rupert Adams, a spokesman for the London-based bookmaker William Hill. ''People are obsessed about this book.'' Instead, bookmakers will accept wagers on the identity of the killer. Lord Voldemort, who dispatched Harry's parents, is the 2-to-1 favorite at William Hill, followed by the Hogwarts teacher Severus Snape at 5 to 2. ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,'' above, which J. K. Rowling has said is the final novel in the series, goes on sale July 21. Historic Letters Surface In Swiss Laundry Room A filing cabinet in a Swiss laundry room has yielded a trove of nearly 1,000 letters written by Napoleon, Churchill, Peter the Great, Gandhi, Pushkin, John Donne and Queen Elizabeth I, among others, Reuters reported yesterday. Spanning more than half a millennium and ranging across art, science, literature and philosophy, the letters were amassed in more than 30 years of collecting by a wealthy Austrian banker and are to be auctioned by Christie's in London on July 3, when they are expected to fetch as much as $4.6 million. The collector, Albin Schram, kept them in an old metal filing cabinet in the laundry room of his villa in Lausanne. When he died in 2005, his family scarcely knew they were there. One of the rarest letters was written by an apologetic Napoleon on the morning after a furious argument with his wife, Josephine. In a spidery scrawl full of corrections and crossings out, Napoleon wrote, ''I send you three kisses -- one on your heart, one on your mouth and one on your eyes.'' Rain Disrupts 'Romeo' Recent rains have washed out the first preview of the Public Theater's presentation of Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park.

Ethan Coen, below, whose credits as a filmmaker include ''Blood Simple,'' ''Raising Arizona,'' ''Fargo'' and ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?,'' will turn up as a playwright with ''Three Short Plays by Ethan Coen'' in the fall season on the Atlantic Theater Company's Stage 2. The company's main stage season includes the world premiere of ''Trumpery'' by Peter Parnell (who adapted John Irving's ''Cider House Rules'' for the stage); the world premiere of ''Parlour Song'' by the British playwright Jez Butterworth (''Mojo''); the New York premiere of ''Port Authority'' by Conor McPherson (''Shining City''); and the world premiere of ''Scarcity'' by Lucy Thurber (''Bottom of the World'').

2007-06-05T00:00:00Z,"Support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dropped to its lowest since he took office in September, hovering at 30 percent in a poll by the national daily Asahi Shimbun. Other polls indicated a similar slide in Mr. Abe's approval ratings, which have suffered from the recent suicide of his scandal-tainted agricultural minister and from the government's mishandling of pension records. The fall increased the possibility that his governing Liberal Democratic Party might lose seats in July's upper house election; an outright defeat could spur calls for him to step down as party leader and prime minister.

Over all, 42 percent of registered voters have an unfavorable view of Mrs. Clinton, 38 percent have a favorable opinion and 21 percent do not yet have an opinion.

2007-06-05T00:00:00Z,"Officials with the Adirondack Council, an environmental group, are lobbying to reverse planned reductions in the federal budget that would severely limit or eliminate several acid rain monitoring programs.

Two other programs that sample lakes and streams in the Adirondacks and other areas of the Northeast on an annual combined budget of less than $1 million would also be eliminated. Acid rain remains a serious problem in many parts of the country, but nowhere has it been more damaging than in the Adirondacks, where vast forests have been decimated and more than 500 lakes and ponds have been left unable to support many species of native fish.

Under the measure, to be introduced next week as an amendment to the Senate energy bill, cities and states would face penalties unless they adopted a standard nationwide code or their own codes requiring energy-efficient systems and designs. Cities that met the standards would be exempt from the penalties even if their states failed to do so, Mr. Schumer said.

It is rare for a person to touch so many lives...Janet did. Her lifelong energy and passion for improving the lives of elders will guide the field in the future. She was a Great Lady and will be missed. The Brookdale Foundation Stephen L. Schwartz, President $(6$)SAINER--Janet. The Hunter College community mourns the loss of a dear friend and proud alumna. A pioneer in the field of aging, Janet served as Commissioner of the NYC Department of Aging and dedicated herself to improving the quality of life for older New Yorkers for more than 50 years.

Citymeals might never have taken root and flourished without her instinctive response, her enthusiasm and creativity in 1981 as the Commissioner for the New York City Department for the Aging. She was a pioneer and tireless activist in the field of aging, developing innovative programs copied nationwide. She was the energy behind the Retired Senior Volunteer Program with over 700 sites across the country and established the city's Alzheimer's Resource Center. And she remained an aggressive activist for the elderly long into her own 80s, bringing her wisdom just this week to a conference in Denver where she delivered her last plea for the cause that filled her life with meaning. Feeling this sad loss ourselves, we send comfort to Janet's family who so clearly adored her."

2007-06-05T00:00:00Z,"Robots may one day be routinely used for surgery. The HeartLander prototype below uses suction to adhere to a beating heart. Moving like an inchworm, it can reach areas that now require doctors to deflate a patient's lungs. Other researchers are working on flexible, snakelike robots to operate in the throat, and on another system that provides visual rather than tactile feedback for surgical workstations. FRANK O'CONNELL HOW THE HEARTLANDER ROBOT WORKS 1. The robot is inserted through a small incision below the sternum. 2. Forceps are used to place the robot directly on the heart. 3. After the robot attaches itself, the surgeon guides it over the heart with a joystick. HeartLander moves by alternately applying suction to each of its two chambers. Tethers attach to an external vacuum pump and a control box. It is turned by pushing and pulling on the drive wires. POTENTIAL USES The robot may be used to inject medication into difficult-to-reach areas of the heart; to attach pacemaker electrodes; and to selectively burn heart tissue, in a technique for curing arrhythmia. (Diagrams highlight the following): FRONT BODY FRONT SUCTION LINE POSITION SENSOR FRONT SUCTION CHAMBER: An external pump provides suction.

Mr. Zhang, left, used a news conference to predict that emissions of sulfur dioxide in the air and levels of water pollution measured by a process known as chemical oxygen demand would fall this year. Cutting those areas of pollution are the main indicators in China’s nationwide plan for a 10 percent reduction in pollution by 2010. Last year, China failed to meet its goal of two percent reductions in each category and instead registered small increases. But Mr. Zhang said improvements had become evident after government programs to install pollution technology on coal-fired power plants, as well as the installation of new wastewater treatment equipment. He acknowledged that other pollutants, including ammonia, continued to rise. And greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide are increasing rapidly."

At a tour of an experimental affordable housing project in Moscow, Mr. Putin asked the mayor to remain in office, ostensibly to address several outstanding housing problems in the capital. The Kremlin will likely seek to wield Mr. Luzhkov’s influence for its benefit in the forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections."

Why else would an Englishman call them chips instead of crisps? But Mr. Chase -- who grows, slices, fries, flavors and packages the potatoes on his farm, Tyrrells Court -- can call them anything he wants: he has come up with flavors with new personality. How about asparagus and crushed black pepper? Or mature Cheddar and chives? Not that you will go wrong with the simple sea salt variety. Some, like the asparagus, and Ludlow sausage and mustard, are seasonal and available only by calling or visiting Chelsea Market Baskets, the importer, 75 Ninth Avenue (15th Street).

Last year, China failed to meet its goal of two percent reductions in each category and instead registered small increases. But Mr. Zhang said improvements had become evident after government programs to install pollution technology on coal-fired power plants, as well as the installation of new wastewater treatment equipment. He acknowledged that other pollutants, including ammonia, continued to rise. And greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide are increasing rapidly. JIM YARDLEY"

A former Commissioner of the New York City Department for the Aging, the country's largest such area agency, Mrs. Sainer was a leader in the policy and practice of aging services for more than 50 years. A pilot program she developed early in her career led to the establishment of the national Retired and Senior Volunteer Program, and her unflagging activism in her own ''retirement'' years was the best evidence for the contribution she knew seniors could make to the world around them. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her family, and may her memory be for a blessing. Judge Ellen M. Heller, President Eugene J. Ribakoff, Chairman of the Board Steven Schwager, Executive Vice-President $(6$)SAINER--Janet. With great sadness the NYC Department for the Aging mourns the passing of Janet Sainer.

Janet's tremendous legacy includes the creation of the nations first Alzheimer's Unit here at the Department, Citymeals - On Wheels, DFTA's intergenerational work study program, its Grandparent Resource Center, and the Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) for the Community Service Society. Janet's vision, spirit and legacy will live on through the programs she established at the department. Edwin Mendez-Santiago, LCSW, Commissioner $(6$)SAINER--Janet. The Aging in New York Fund mourns the passing of its founder and continuing mentor and board member, Janet Sainer. The matriarch of ANYF, Commissioner Sainer was a visionary leader and innovator in the field of aging services in New York City and throughout the country. Now in its 23rd year, ANYF derives its mission from Commissioner Sainer's vision for an organization dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for older New Yorkers and their families through public/private partnerships, seeking resources to develop innovative service models that address the unmet needs of New York City's elderly, caregivers and the network of aging service providers. Under Janet Sainer's tenure as Commissioner of the New York City Department for the Aging, ANYF sponsored the City's first annual Mayoral Conference on Alzheimers Disease and numerous initiatives focusing on the needs of personal and professional caregivers and it launched the first home delivered meals program and other activities that serve today as models in other parts of the country. From its inception, ANYF has benefited from Commissioner Sainer's guidance and wisdom. Its initiatives and programs on behalf of New York City's older adults are the enduring legacy of her enlightened inspiration and accomplishment. Allen B. Roberts Chairman Edwin Mendez-Santiago, LCSW, President Ali Hodin-Baier Executive Director $(6$)SAINER--Janet. The entire DOROT community mourns the loss of a beloved friend and a peerless advocate for the elderly.

2007-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The Austrian government said yesterday it had appointed Dominique Meyer, the director of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, to lead the Vienna State Opera starting in the 2010-11 season. Joining him then as music director will be the Austrian Franz Welser-Möst, who holds the same position with the Cleveland Orchestra. Mr. Welser-Möst, who is also music director of the Zurich Opera, will succeed Seiji Ozawa. Mr. Meyer, 51, will replace Ioan Holender, the long-serving director of the house, who has said that he will not renew his contract. The succession became embroiled in politics when the Austrian chancellor and opera fan Alfred Gusenbauer was perceived as lobbying for his favorite, the American opera singer Neil Shicoff. The appointment was announced by Claudia Schmied, the culture minister, who oversees the opera house. Mr. Meyer has been at the Paris theater since 1999. He is a past director general of the Lausanne and Paris National operas and has held a number of government posts. DANIEL J. WAKIN"

2007-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The city has settled a federal lawsuit by 18 former Brooklyn College graduate art students and their teacher that charged that the city violated their free speech rights, awarding them $750 each, $42,500 in fees to their three lawyers and issuing a letter of apology. Details of the settlement were released yesterday by Norman Siegel, a lawyer for the students, and by Jonathan Pines, an assistant corporation counsel. ''The lesson here is that the government is not the appropriate body to judge the value of art work,'' Mr. Siegel said. The suit, filed in district court in Brooklyn last June, claimed that the students' First Amendment rights were violated and their work damaged last May when their thesis exhibition was ordered closed by the Brooklyn parks commissioner, Julius Spiegel. Mr. Spiegel wrote the letter of apology, after saying at the time that some of the artwork was inappropriate for families. A live rat and a sculpture of a hand holding a penis were in the show, in a World War II Memorial hall near the Brooklyn Bridge. FELICIA R. LEE"

2007-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The Lotus Sanitizing System ($149.99) claims to oxygenate water, turning it into a natural cleanser. At 11 by 14 inches, it may be the bulkiest object on your counter, but the premise is neat: press a button and presto! Oxygenated water, which sucks up bacteria because it has a third oxygen molecule. It had no effect on the mystery stains on my carpet, but on the bathtub it seemed to work as well as Ajax. To test its other application -- nuking the scary things on your food -- I tipped a pint of strawberries into its bowl attachment and let it whir. But how can you tell it's working? Steve Hengsperger, president of Tersano, the company that makes Lotus, pointed me to a number on the box. ''That number is the E.P.A.'s approval of the device as a sanitizer,'' he said. ''Lysol has the same thing.'' Without the nose-singeing smell of bleach or Lysol, it's leap-of-faith territory, but the idea of never buying another bottle of Fantastik or Clorox is appealing.

The decision comes a year after the agency's safety reviewers strongly recommended just such a step. It also occurs during a Congressional inquiry into why the agency delayed its warnings about Avandia. [Page A1.] A medical researcher told a House hearing about name-calling and a veiled threat of a lawsuit by a drug company executive after the researcher had criticized Avandia. [A30.] CHINA TO OVERHAUL FOOD LAWS -- China said that it was overhauling its food and drug safety regulations and would introduce nationwide inspections. The announcement was a response to growing international concerns about tainted food and counterfeit drugs. [A1.] A BOOMING BUSINESS IN AUTO PARTS -- China's auto parts exports have increased more than sixfold in the last five years, nearly topping $1 billion in April, and are part of a broader shift as China moves up from basic goods like textiles and shoes toward higher-value industrial goods that compete directly with countries like the United States. [C1.] AUTOMAKERS OPPOSE ENERGY BILL -- The chief executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler met with Senate lawmakers, less than a week before Democrats plan a vote on a sprawling energy bill, and asserted that the bill's proposed increase in mileage requirements would be impossible to meet and would gravely damage the industry. [C1.] BUILDING A BETTER PATENT SYSTEM -- The Bush administration wants to revamp the nation's patent system, requiring better information from inventors and allowing public scrutiny of applications, according to the patent office's chief. The goal, said Jon W. Dudas, above, the director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, is to improve the quality of patents and curb the rising wave of patent disputes and lawsuits. [C3.] LESSONS FROM LONDON -- The Bancroft family, owners of a controlling interest in Dow Jones, is trying to learn from the lessons of The Times of London as they attempt to come up with a system for keeping The Wall Street Journal's newsroom independent of Rupert Murdoch, the head of the News Corporation who has bid to buy the company. [C1.] INTEREST RATE JITTERS -- For the second consecutive day, Wall Street recoiled at the prospect that inflation would not settle down enough to suit the Federal Reserve. And investors appeared to worry not only that interest rates will stay where they are, but that the Fed could raise them even higher. [C1.] RABBIT EARS WILL NEED SOME HELP -- A broadcasters group unveiled two versions of devices that television viewers will need beginning Feb. 17, 2009, if they use rabbit ears or rooftop antennas to receive their television signal.

European stock markets fell. [C5.] ORIENTING ELECTRONICS TO WOMEN -- Making a consumer electronic product more appealing to women no longer means offering a pink or pastel version. More manufacturers are discovering that feminizing technology is more about a product's fundamentals, often expressed in its ease of use.

2007-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Muhammad is now the second most popular name for baby boys in Britain, outstripped only by Jack, The Times of London reported. It said it based its conclusion on an analysis of 3,000 names provided by the Office for National Statistics for births in 2006 and had taken into account 14 different spellings for the name. Using the spelling Muhammad in its article, the newspaper said that the popularity of the name came from the growing number of young Muslim couples having families. Many of these parents chose the name of the prophet in order to show a solidarity with their religion, the newspaper said. According to the Times analysis, Muhammad (5,991) could outscore Jack (6,928) by the end of this year if the name's current rate of popularity continued. The names Thomas and Joshua followed Muhammad closely in third and fourth places. No other Muslim names showed up in the list of 20 names published by the newspaper. JANE PERLEZ"

2007-06-07T00:00:00Z,"There are more than 50 new items in the architect Frank Gehry's housewares collection for Tiffany & Company, all recognizably Gehry-esque in their sweeping sculptural forms. Beyond that, though, the aesthetic range is wide -- as is the range of prices. Some pieces come in jewel-like Murano glass (the red and blue Flux bowls, top right, are $1,650 and $2,200), while others are sterling silver, inspired by crumpled paper but priced much higher (the Torque Object, right, is $25,000). The Leaf platters in bubinga wood and sterling silver are more costly still (the 14-inch wood version, top, is $25,000, and the six-inch silver one is $50,000). Mr. Gehry's personal favorites -- because of the ''basic grid pattern,'' he said, and the ''simple but commanding form'' -- are the openwork china and sterling pieces (the Grid Object pictured with Mr. Gehry is $4,500). There is something for smaller budgets, too: the three-inch Rock tumbler, in bone china, is $35.

2007-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Wu Bangguo, the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said at a conference in Beijing that Hong Kong had considerable autonomy only because the central government had chosen to authorize that autonomy. Under the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, China promised Britain that as part of the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule China would preserve ''a high degree of autonomy'' for the territory. But Chinese officials focus these days on the Basic Law, a Beijing-drafted document that serves as Hong Kong's mini-constitution and gives broad powers to the Standing Committee in Beijing to set policy in Hong Kong by interpreting the territory's laws. Mr. Wu spoke ahead of the 10th anniversary on July 1 of Hong Kong's return to China. KEITH BRADSHER"
2007-06-07T00:00:00Z,"CYCLISTS looking to travel with a bicycle or two face the challenge of how to safely cart them, without damaging the car or their precious cargo. Racks that attach to the back hitch under the bumper are one solution. Sport utility vehicles, station wagons and trucks typically come standard with hitches, with either a 1.25- or 2-inch-diameter receiver. Hitch racks are better for a car's aerodynamics than roof racks. And unlike carriers strapped to the trunk, empty hitch racks usually don't have to be removed from the vehicle to access the back of the car. Raxter Racks, a two-year-old company in Broken Arrow, Okla., sells only hitch racks, and its sales have increased about 300 percent since last year."

In the first episode, the police received a report about 11 a.m. that a female bear was inside a house, said Darlene Yuhas, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Protection. She said officers chased the bear and her three cubs, all of which ran up a nearby tree. After the authorities conferred with state officials, a township officer was given permission to shoot and kill the adult bear, Ms. Yuhas said. The cubs, which were a few months old and weighed 18 to 20 pounds each, were taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center. A few hours later, the police received a report of another female bear inside a nearby house, chased her into a tree along with her cubs, and fatally shot her. Those cubs were also taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center. Ms. Yuhas said state biologists have determined that when bears break into homes, damage property or attack pets, they should generally be killed."

A separate group approached Mr. Sabatera and Mr. Agard, with at least one of them firing a .40-caliber handgun, the investigator said. The investigator said Mr. Agard appeared to be the target. Mr. Sabatera was pronounced dead at Metropolitan Hospital Center; Mr. Agard was pronounced dead at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital, the police said.

Reichbach of State Supreme Court, said he would decide on Monday whether to dismiss murder charges against the defendant, John Sinagra. Mr. Sinagra is charged with the 1990 killing of the witness, Patrick Porco, 18. Prosecutors brought murder charges against Mr. Sinagra last year as part of their case against a former F.B.I. supervisor, Roy Lindley DeVecchio, who has been accused of helping a Mafia informer commit several killings. Justice Reichbach called a series of hearings compelling prosecutors to show good cause for their delay in bringing charges. Prosecutors have disclosed documents showing that Mr. Sinagra was named as a suspect as early as 1995, but that the police later closed the case, attributing the Porco killing to a man who had since died."

The man, Ben Carpenter, 21, of Kalamazoo, had started to cross on Wednesday at an intersection in Paw Paw, about 140 miles west of Detroit, where the truck was stopped at a red light.

Officials said the move was a needed security measure as its fight with Tamil rebels intensified but offered no evidence that the people expelled posed a threat. Human rights groups warned that the move against Tamil civilians could be the start of an &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; campaign.

Colombo, in the south, has been subjected to rebel suicide bombings and air raids in recent months but spared the intense, day-to-day fighting seen in the north and east.

Matt Cimber made this World War II drama after his friend Max Guefen told him about his cousin Miriam's struggle to survive in German-occupied Lithuania, where her family was robbed, brutalized and eventually shipped to a concentration camp.

2007-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Prosecutors and the police failed to ask important questions about the killing of a witness to a Mafia murder, a judge said yesterday at a pretrial hearing. The judge, Gustin L. Reichbach of State Supreme Court, said he would decide on Monday whether to dismiss murder charges against the defendant, John Sinagra. Mr. Sinagra is charged with the 1990 killing of the witness, Patrick Porco, 18. Prosecutors brought murder charges against Mr. Sinagra last year as part of their case against a former F.B.I. supervisor, Roy Lindley DeVecchio, who has been accused of helping a Mafia informer commit several killings. Justice Reichbach called a series of hearings compelling prosecutors to show good cause for their delay in bringing charges. Prosecutors have disclosed documents showing that Mr. Sinagra was named as a suspect as early as 1995, but that the police later closed the case, attributing the Porco killing to a man who had since died.

The homeowner, Andrew J. Hall, had argued that the artwork, by the German sculptor Anselm Kiefer, was not subject to commission approval because it could not legally be considered a structure. The Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's decision, saying the six-ton concrete and steel work fit within the commission's jurisdiction.

This five-hour block party focuses on four areas of hip-hop culture: D.J.-ing, M.C.-ing, breaking and creating graffiti. After an opening performance by Adia Whitaker's neo-folkloric Ase Dance Theater Collective, Mr. Albright, accompanied by D.J. Swift and D.J.

It's a potent image that's all the more effective for being tossed off: Mr. Erickson, the lead singer of the 13th Floor Elevators and maybe the most influential 1960s pop star that most folks haven't heard of, has had so little control over his life and image for so many years that he's become a goofy blank slate."

Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00).

(Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'CRAZY MARY' Sigourney Weaver and Kristine Nielsen serve their specialties (WASP tartness, madcap madness) with such gusto in A. R. Gurney's comedy that it feels ungallant to point out that their characters are as artificial as hard-plastic dolls. A contrived play that never quite connects its thoughtful mind with its sentimental heart (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'ELECTRA' An ''adaptation'' of Sophocles' play that is more of a spoof of a Greek tragedy than any serious attempt to revive one (1:10). The HAS Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, at 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 868-4444.(Wilborn Hampton) 'ENSEMBLE STUDIO THEATER MARATHON 2007: SERIES A' Neil LaBute's contemporary gloss on a classic tale of Greek vengeance is the highlight of the first round in this annual series of short plays. Dana Delany and Victor Slezak are woman scorned and cad of a hubby in a gruesome drama that packs a visceral punch. Unfortunately, Mr. LaBute's play comes last in a mostly unrewarding program (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'FATE'S IMAGINATION' Sex and politics, a natural combination in real life, don't mesh very well in Randall David Cook's play, but his ear for humor makes this comic drama about a politician's son who has a fling with an older woman pretty entertaining anyway (1:30). Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger) 'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists clichéd feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Ginia Bellafante) 'HORIZON' God is in the curriculum in Rinde Eckert's lively portrait of a theologian, an homage to the ''Christian realism'' of Reinhold Niebuhr. But even the fiercest secularist should find pleasure in this engaging performance piece, set in the seminary-without-walls of one man's mind (1:25). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-8996. (Brantley) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clichéd territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) * 'PASSING STRANGE' The composer and performer Stew narrates this semiautobiographical show about a songwriter on a journey of self-discovery. Part rock concert, part book musical, it flows smoothly on a strong current of feeling and humor as the Los Angeles-born central character searches for his musical voice in the hash bars of Amsterdam and the cabarets of Berlin (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) 'TEA' Age-blind casting is a great strength of the Pan Asian Repertory Theater's production of this play about four Japanese war brides who gather in 1968 to clean up the house of a fifth, who has killed herself. Velina Hasu Houston's play requires the five actresses to portray their characters at every stage of their lives, and it works well that some of them actually are young, while others, like Ako, who plays the uptight, more-Japanese-than-thou Atsuko, are well into middle age. But the play itself crams verbiage and melodrama into what feels like a television epic, complete with that most stereotypical of figures, the dead woman's ghost seeking liberation into the next world. The whole thing goes down like a long soap opera, though the actresses do their best to bring it all to life (1:30). West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette) Off Off Broadway 'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'ROMEO AND JULIET' Shakespeare imagined many things, yet perhaps even he wouldn't have envisioned this classic tragedy as a musical. The director Ellen Stewart has added many new elements, but the sum remains woefully less than its parts (2:15). LaMaMa E.T.C. Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Claudia La Rocco) 'TIME FLIES AND OTHERS BY IVES' An amusing collection of comic playlets by David Ives embraces the little guy (1:35). Laurie Beechman Theater, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ALL HER FACES: A PORTRAIT OF DUSTY SPRINGFIELD' There's no accounting for fans, as proved by Anthony Inneo's loving but slight tribute to Springfield. If you know the lyrics well enough to sing along, you could do worse than spend an hour listening to some of that English diva's hits, barely packaged in the shape of a play (1:15). La MaMa E.T.C. (the Club), 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (La Rocco) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'CIRKUS INFERNO' Happy lunacy (1:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912; closes on Sunday. (Gates) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'MAUD, THE MADNESS' The familiarity of many quotations from the works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson has done nothing to allay my philistine sense of that poet as dated and uneven in quality. This dramatized version of his epic poem ''Maud,'' which he termed a monodrama, does little to dispel such prejudice. Although the actor Jonathan Tindle and the director Niegel Smith have made a prodigious effort to lift Lord Alfred's words off the page, the mad Gothic protagonist they create is unappealing, and his flowery words remain a monument to an aesthetic of another time (1:30). June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 352-3101. ( Midgette) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'PHALLACY' Art and science collide in this play by Carl Djerassi, but it's not much of a mash-up; a chemist proves that a curator's prize sculpture has been misdated, and there's not much refuting the evidence (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'rosebud: the lives of orson welles' Cineastes will feel cheated by the Welsh playwright Mark Jenkins's effort to cover all the well-known triumphs and tragedies of this legendary filmmaker's life in under 90 minutes. He walks briskly and rests nowhere long enough. This is a one-man show, and Christian McKay, however, is Welles to the soles of his feet (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AMU' (No rating, 102 minutes, in English, Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi) This ambitious first feature by Shonali Bose, about Kaju, a young Indian-American woman searching for the real India and for her roots, begins as a gentle comedy of cultures clashing. Its true topic, though, is the riots that broke out in Delhi in 1984 after Indira Gandhi's assassination. Thousands of Sikhs were killed, and as Kaju learns, justice has been delayed and denied. (Rachel Saltz) 'ANGEL-A' (R, 90 minutes) Beneath its sophisticated Gallic gloss, this handsomely photographed feel-good fantasy, which shamelessly recycles ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and ''Heaven Can Wait,'' suggests an episode of ''Touched by an Angel'' without the tears. (Stephen Holden) * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'THE BOSS OF IT ALL' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Danish) To describe ''The Boss of It All,'' Lars von Trier's acidic corporate comedy, as '' 'The Office' viewed through the looking glass'' only scratches the surface of the newest film from one of the foremost tricksters of world cinema. (Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'BROOKLYN RULES' (R, 99 minutes) However authentic and heartfelt this film's depiction of life on the meaner streets of the Northeast corridor may be, its story of three friends growing up in a mob-infested Brooklyn neighborhood doesn't begin to match ''The Sopranos'' in its epic vision of violence, class struggle and upward mobility in a barbarous culture. (Holden) 'BUG' (R, 102 minutes) In this overwrought psychodrama from the director William Friedkin, Ashley Judd's acting continues to surpass her career choices. Playing a shaky Oklahoma barmaid, she convincingly juggles an abusive husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and a newfound lover (Michael Shannon) who sees creepy-crawlies in the mattress and conspiracies everywhere. Though the movie's escalating hysteria may strain credulity, Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'CRAZY LOVE' (PG-13, 92 minutes) Love is blind, and so too is Linda Pugach, one of the loony-tuners in Dan Klores's somewhat sickening, mildly gonzo documentary. In 1959 Mrs. Pugach, then 22 and known as Linda Riss, was blinded by her husband-to-be Burton Pugach, a Bronx ambulance chaser who single-mindedly pursued the object of his obsession all the way to the marriage altar. (Dargis) 'DAY WATCH' (R, 140 minutes, in Russian) Picking up a number of years after ''Night Watch'' concludes, this second installment in Timur Bekmambetov's bustling supernatural trilogy dazzles and confuses with equal determination. Less coherent than its predecessor, if equally creative, the movie depicts hidden dimensions teeming with beings who swap bodies at will and rewrite destiny with something called the Chalk of Fate. Perhaps the Fickle Finger was otherwise engaged. (Catsoulis) 'FAY GRIM' (R, 118 minutes) Too light-headed to qualify as satire, too poker-faced to register as comedy, this elaborate spy spoof, a sequel to ''Henry Fool,'' belongs in its own stylistic niche: the Hal Hartley film. Movies emanating from Planet Hartley are an acquired taste shared by hipper-than-thou insiders. (Holden) 'THE FIFTH EMPIRE' (No rating, 127 minutes, in Portuguese) With this stubbornly static, talky drama about a young Portuguese king hoping to unite his troubled nation by embarking on a foreign adventure, the prolific 98-year-old director Manoel de Oliveira pushes his already minimalist style about as far as it can go. At the same time, though, Mr. Olivieira's aesthetic is in sync with his main interest: capturing characters' words and gestures in real time as they work through philosophical and political conundrums while remaining largely oblivious to the physical world around them. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott) * 'GRACIE' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Set in New Jersey in 1978, Davis Guggenheim's sensitive underdog tale depicts the obstacles faced by a young girl who dreams of playing on her high school's all-boy soccer team. While connecting the familiar adversity-drama dots -- the beat-down, the pickup, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter -- the movie's follow-your-heart simplicity masks an unusual degree of emotional complexity. (Catsoulis) * 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) * 'KNOCKED UP' (R, 129 minutes) Foul of mouth and true of heart, this new comedy from Judd Apatow (''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'') captures the sexual and moral confusion of the present moment remarkably well. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are unlikely bedfellows but perfect comic foils as a shlub-babe couple whose one-night stand leans to an unintended but not unwelcome pregnancy. (Scott) 'MR. BROOKS' (R, 120 minutes) Kevin Costner and William Hurt camp it up as a serial killer and his demonic alter ego in ''Mr. Brooks,'' a werewolf movie masquerading as a sophisticated thriller. (Holden) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) * 'PAPRIKA' (R, 90 minutes, in Japanese) In this gorgeous riot of future-shock ideas and brightly animated imagery, the doors of perception never close. Satoshi Kon's mind-twisting, eye-tickling animé isn't greasy kid's stuff: it's for thinking, interested adults whose sense of wonder remains as alive as their imaginations. (Dargis) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis) 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Seitz) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Saltz) * 'TEN CANOES' (No rating, 90 minutes, in various Yolngu Aboriginal dialects) There is nothing more enthralling than a good yarn, and the mesmerizing ''Ten Canoes'' interweaves two versions of the same Australian Aboriginal fable, one filmed in black and white and set a thousand years ago and an even older one, filmed in color and set in prehistoric times. (Holden) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series and Revivals LINDSAY ANDERSON'S MICK TRAVIS TRILOGY (Wednesday and Thursday) The British director Lindsay Anderson made three films centered on his everyman character, Mick Travis, played by Malcolm McDowell as a public school rebel in ''If '' (1968), as a disillusioned traveling coffee salesman in ''O Lucky Man!'' (1973) and finally as a hapless victim of the collapsing English health care system in ''Britannia Hospital'' (1982). Anthology Film Archives has managed to assemble all three features for rare sequential screenings -- no easy feat, because each film is controlled by a different company. The screenings begin on Wednesday with ''If '' and ''O Lucky Man!'' and continue on Thursday with ''O Lucky Man!'' and ''Britannia Hospital.'' The films continue in rotation through June 17. Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Dave Kehr) SAM FULLER (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image wraps up its retrospective of the vivid, visceral work of this tabloid reporter turned filmmaker this weekend with screenings of the restored 158-minute version of his World War II epic, ''The Big Red One'' (1980), as well as three rarely shown films from Fuller's late period: ''Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street'' (1972) and ''White Dog'' (1981) tomorrow, and ''Street of No Return'' (1982) on Sunday. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Kehr) THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE SINGER (Monday) A rare showing of Chris Marker's 1974 documentary about the French singer and political activist Yves Montand, presented with two short films by Mr. Marker, ''The Embassy'' (1973) and ''The Sixth Side of the Pentagon'' (1968). BAM Cinématek, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; bam.org; $10. (Kehr) OPEN ROADS: NEW ITALIAN CINEMA (Today through Thursday) A selection of notable recent Italian films continues tonight with the premiere of Angelo Longoni's ''Caravaggio,'' which stars Alessio Boni (''The Best of Youth'') as the tempestuous painter of the title and features cinematography by another Italian master of light and shadow, Vittorio Storaro. Among the week's other highlights: ''In Memory of Me,'' the second feature of Saverio Costanzo (''Private''), about a young man who enters an island seminary (tomorrow and Wednesday); ''Primo Levi's Journey,'' a documentary by Davide Ferrario that traces Levi's path from the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp to his home in Turin (Wednesday and Thursday); and ''See Naples and Die,'' an examination of the city in all of its glory and squalor, directed by Enrico Caria (tomorrow and Monday). Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * LILY ALLEN (Tuesday) A 22-year-old British singer with deceptively sweet, ska-infused electro-pop songs, Ms. Allen is at her best when snarkily putting down disagreeable suitors. ''Smile,'' a No. 1 hit in England, is pure schadenfreude, and ''Knock 'Em Out'' a catalog of snappy answers to bad pickup lines: ''I've got herpes. No, I've got syphilis.'' With Kevin Michael. At 6:45 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario) ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI, BLACK MOTH SUPER RAINBOW (Tonight) If the musical segments on ''Sesame Street'' were made with a chamber orchestra and choir and intended for an audience of hyperintelligent prodigies, they might sound something like Architecture in Helsinki, from Australia: frolicsome and inventive, as if every instrument were being played for the first time. Black Moth Super Rainbow, from Pittsburgh, delivers shimmering psychedelia through a screen of pulsating keyboards and blissed-out, robotic vocals. With Santogold. At 9, Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario) BABY GRAMPS (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday) With a gray beard the size of small shrubbery, a raspy Popeye voice and manic skills on the steel guitar, Baby Gramps offers a cartoonish variation on the role of hobo troubadour in old-timey songs like ''Big Rock Candy Mountain.'' But where he really shines is with hilarious and ingenious wordplay, as in his palindrome song (''Go hang a salami -- I'm a lasagna hog''). Tonight at 7, Terra Blues, 149 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-7776, terrablues.com; $10. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10. Tuesday at 8 p.m., with Kill Henry Sugar, at the Gershwin Hotel, 7 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (646) 207-0595, gershwinhotel.com; $10. (Sisario) EEF BARZELAY (Wednesday) With a homely, nasal tenor and a few lonesome strums on his guitar, Mr. Barzelay, of the band Clem Snide, can render heartache with trompe-l'oeil precision or, if the mood strikes him, simply goof off. In one song on his latest solo album, ''Bitter Honey'' (SpinArt), he takes on the persona of a woman whose rear end makes an appearance in a hip-hop video: ''It was on screen for a second but was kind of hard to miss.'' At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) BOOKER T. AND THE MG'S, SHARON JONES (Wednesday and Thursday) As the house band of Stax Records in the 1960s, Booker T. Jones and his crew had an incalculable role in the creation of Southern soul-funk, mixing musky blues with house-rocking R&B grooves built around the whirr of the organ. Sharon Jones is the queen of an active local scene that recreates, spiritedly but not too pedantically, the vintage Stax sound. Wednesday at 7 p.m., Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, rivertorivernyc.com; Thursday at noon, BAM Rhythm & Blues Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, downtown Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; both free. (Sisario) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday and Monday) Elegant, witty and touching, this classically trained jazz pianist and singer, now 82, is in her prime: the female counterpart of Bobby Short. Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58 on Sunday, with brunch at noon; $40 on Monday, with a $20 minimum. (Stephen Holden) * CARTEL (Tuesday) Those polished, punky riffs and bright singalong choruses straight out of the Blink-182 playbook are not the only signs that this Atlanta band isn't averse to blatant commercialism. Since May 24, Cartel has been inside a giant fiberglass bubble on Pier 54 in Manhattan, recording its second album in a carefully choreographed publicity stunt that involves an MTV reality show and Web tie-ins from Dr Pepper. On Tuesday the band emerges from the bubble and plays a concert on the pier. Presumably Dr Pepper will be on sale. At 6 p.m., Hudson River at 13th Street, West Village, (212) 533-7275, hudsonriverpark.org; free. (Sisario) THE CLIENTELE (Tonight) There's comfort in familiarity, and the soft, sweetly finessed songs by this veteran British indie-cabaret band, with echoes of the Byrds' gleaming folk-rock and George Harrison's breathy calm -- expertly channeled by Alasdair Maclean -- are a seductive sonic cocoon. With Beach House and Pipas. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) COWBOY JUNKIES (Wednesday) Almost 20 years ago this Toronto band released an instant classic with the somber and starkly elegant ''Trinity Session.'' And though on subsequent albums the Cowboy Junkies have never returned to that expressive peak, the delicate interplay between Margo Timmins's velvety alto and her brother Michael Timmins's muted guitar can be chillingly beautiful. At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $40. (Sisario) DEFTONES (Tonight and tomorrow night) Alternately glum and explosive, this long-running alt-metal band from Sacramento plays tightly compacted guitar riffs as the singer Chino Moreno howls and croons on themes of disintegration and decay. With Dir En Grey and the Fall of Troy. At 7:30, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $27.50 (sold out tomorrow). (Sisario) DUMPSTAPHUNK (Tonight) The MySpace image for Ivan Neville's new band gives an idea of where it's coming from: the site shows a satellite picture of Hurricane Katrina about to crash into New Orleans. Funk bands are supposed to be about good times, and Dumpstaphunk, the current reigning New Orleans funk outfit, provides that in abundance. But in angry, topical songs like ''Livin' in a World Gone Mad'' it also reminds us why the good vibes are so badly needed. At 11, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $17. (Sisario) * FEIST (Monday and Tuesday) Leslie Feist, who performs under her last name, has become a genuine star of the mellow indie-arty scene with deliciously melodic songs on grown-up topics that balance pop ambitions with outsider quirkiness. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; sold out. (Sisario) * HAPPY MONDAYS (Wednesday and Thursday) Working-class hedonists obsessed with the highs of trippy dance music (and with other kinds of highs), Happy Mondays embodied the ''Madchester'' rave-rock scene in Britain of the late 1980s and early '90s. In its latest reincarnation the band plays as the centerpiece of In the City of New York, a two-day conference organized by Tony Wilson, the Factory Records impresario who discovered Happy Mondays, as told in the film ''24 Hour Party People.'' At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com or inthecityofnewyork.com; $35. (Sisario) LONG BLONDES (Tomorrow) Kate Jackson of the Long Blondes, from Sheffield, England, has figured out at least one important thing about being a pop star: people listen to you when you look good. Her band has made a splash at home as much for its smart and catchy new wave update as for Ms. Jackson's vintage skirts and ''Marlene Dietrich-meets-rockabilly chic,'' as one magazine put it. With the Virgins and the King Left. At 8:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) BERT JANSCH (Sunday) One of the prime movers of the 1960s British folk scene, Mr. Jansch played knotty and expressive acoustic guitar that influenced Jimmy Page and Neil Young, and in songs like ''Needle of Death'' sang in an invitingly guileless voice of a bohemian demimonde. His appearance on the soundtrack to ''The Squid and the Whale'' and interest from neo-folk stars like Beth Orton and Devendra Banhart -- who both appear on his latest album, ''The Black Swan'' (Drag City) -- have introduced him to an appreciative young audience. With P. G. Six and Kevin Barker. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18. (Sisario) JOHN BROWN'S BODY (Tonight) Founded in Ithaca, N.Y., John Brown's Body plays old-fashioned reggae, sometimes updated with dub-inspired electronic effects; the results are less ham-fisted than you might think, which isn't saying much. With Trumystic and Quintus. At 9, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $17. (Kelefa Sanneh) LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO FLEETWOOD MAC (Tonight and tomorrow night) As Nick Lowe said, you've got to be cruel to be kind. Joe McGinty's enduring Loser's Lounge series, now 14, both honors and skewers pop greats with cleverly over-the-top performances, and turns its attention here to soft-rock's most incestuous hitmakers. At 7 and 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) MELT-BANANA (Sunday) The hiccups of guitar and squeals of vocals fly by so fast in the hyperactive music of Melt-Banana, from Japan, that it seems a minor miracle that so many playful pop melodies survive. With Drop Dead and Children. At 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) * NEVILLE BROTHERS (Thursday) Celebrate Brooklyn opens with one of the musical jewels of New Orleans, whose funk lineage stretches back to the 1950s, when the keyboardist Art Neville recorded ''Mardi Gras Mambo'' with the Hawketts. At 5:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, brooklynx.org; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario) LEE (SCRATCH) PERRY (Thursday) Mr. Perry's quirks are inseparable from his inspirations. He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences. As a performer, he sings and rants, with lucid nuggets surrounded by malarkey as he discourses on space aliens, sex, the International Monetary Fund and marijuana. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles) PINK MARTINI (Wednesday) The Hollywood lounge band gone global, this 12-or-so-piece ensemble from Portland, Ore., follows a retro glamour jet stream from Rio to Havana to Paris. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $55. (Sisario) JILL SCOTT (Wednesday and Thursday) Jill Scott spills out words, spoken like hip-hop poetry or sung with jazzy timing, to detail the aspirations and loves of a sensual, intelligent and self-assured woman. The R&B crooner Musiq Soulchild opens on Wednesday; on Thursday the bill is shared by a vocal powerhouse, Chaka Khan, and a current pop hitmaker, Robin Thicke. Mo'Nique is the host of these two shows at Radio City Music Hall. At 8 p.m., (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $49.50 to $69.50 on Wednesday, sold out on Thursday. (Pareles) * STEELY DAN (Sunday, Monday and Wednesday) In 2000 Steely Dan released its first new songs in 20 years on ''Two Against Nature,'' and its members, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, crammed them full of musical subterfuges. The band once hated touring but has become quite proficient at it, especially now that Mr. Becker has accepted his inevitable role as lead guitarist. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Pareles) JOSS STONE, COMMON (Today) The self-reinvention pitch behind her third album says that Ms. Stone is over her early phase of imitating 1960s and '70s soul. But on ''Introducing Joss Stone'' (Virgin), this husky-voiced British 20-year-old still holds fast to retro sounds, this time a high-energy soul-funk tinged with hip-hop. Common, the socially conscious rapper from Chicago, will release his seventh album, ''Finding Forever,'' next month, but he's already on the campaign trail, comparing it to the work of Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye. Also on the bill for this benefit for Central Park SummerStage is Ryan Shaw, who, in a smoking version of Wilson Pickett's ''I Found a Love,'' does the soul-revival thing as well as can be done. At 5 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 307-7171, summerstage.org; $40. (Sisario) MARY TIMONY BAND (Thursday) Mary Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces. With Georgie James and Welcome. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Pareles) * RUFUS WAINWRIGHT (Tonight and tomorrow night) There is bad drama and good drama, and nobody does good drama like Rufus Wainwright, who completes a sold-out four-night engagement at the Blender Theater at Gramercy. With Teddy Thompson tonight and Jason Hart tomorrow night. At 8, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

(Nate Chinen) JAMIE BAUM SEPTET (Tonight) The flutist Jamie Baum favors a carefully organized approach to composition but manages to create ample space for improvisation; a good thing, given that her ensemble here consists of Ralph Alessi on trumpet, Douglas Yates on alto saxophone and bass clarinet, Vincent Chancey on French horn, Vijay Iyer on piano, Boris Kozlov on bass and Jeff Hirshfield on drums. At 8, Neighborhood Church of Greenwich Village, 269 Bleecker Street, at Morton Street, West Village, (212) 691-1770, ncgv.com; free.

(Chinen) THE FOUR BAGS/BROOKLYN QAWWALI PARTY (Sunday) The instrumental palette of the Four Bags -- trombone, accordion, guitar and reeds -- suits their modern sort of chamber jazz. Brooklyn Qawwali Party, which plays a later set, uses a more percussive assortment of instruments to create its caffeinated take on the Sufi devotional music of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. At 7 and 9 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10.

Here he works with Mr. Rainey and a bassist, John Hebert. At 9 and 10:30, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum.

(Chinen) MIKE STERN BAND (Wednesday) The guitarist Mike Stern has a goofily titled new album, ''Who Let the Cats Out?'' (Heads Up), that features the quite serious electric bass playing of Richard Bona. This engagement features Mr. Bona, along with the drummer Lionel Cordew. At 10, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) * TRIBUTE TO OSCAR PETERSON: MASTER OF SWING (Tonight) This legendary pianist, now in his 80s, won't personally preside over this tribute, but that's no reason to overlook an embarrassment of riches that includes the pianists Hank Jones, Billy Taylor and Marian McPartland; the trumpeters Clark Terry and Wynton Marsalis; and the singers Dee Dee Bridgewater and Freddy Cole. At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $18 to $66. (Chinen) * RANDY WESTON (Tonight and tomorrow night) The pianism of Randy Weston can recall Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk, but as a composer, he has long reached beyond strict jazz traditions, as he demonstrates best with his longstanding African Rhythms ensembles. His program here is intended as a tribute to the composer James Reese Europe. At 7:30, Harlem Stage at the Gatehouse, 150 Convent Avenue, at West 135th Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7100, harlemstage.org; $35.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'FALSTAFF' (Tomorrow and Sunday) In its heyday on Bleecker Street, Amato Opera was where young New Yorkers saw their first operas; in its current home on the Bowery, it has taken on a certain quality of camp. But its loyal fans still love it, and it still loves opera, and offers Verdi with all of that love, so that some of the spirit of the opera comes across almost in spite of the variable skills of its performers. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) MET IN THE PARKS (Tuesday and Wednesday) Opera companies are always drumming up new ways to attract a big audience. But the crowds that flock, picnic in tow, to New York city parks for the Metropolitan Opera's annual outdoor summer performances seem to need little enticement. This month the Met is offering ''La Bohème'' and ''Faust.'' At ''Bohème'' on Tuesday, Gareth Morrell conducts Hei-Kyung Hong as Mimì, Mary Dunleavy as Musetta, Roberto Aronica as Rodolfo, Dwayne Croft as Marcello, Jeff Mattsey as Schaunard and Andrew Gangestad as Colline. For ''Faust'' on Wednesday, Maurizio Benini conducts David Pomeroy in the title role, Katie Van Kooten as Marguerite, Kate Lindsey as Siébel, Hung Yun as Valentin and James Morris as Méphistophélès. At 8 p.m., Great Lawn, Central Park, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; free. (Vivien Schweitzer) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday) Romanticism and early Modernism are on the agenda at this floating concert hall this week. Tonight Dmitry Alexeev devotes his piano recital to Beethoven's Sonatas Nos. 5 and 32, as well as to works by Chopin, and Beethoven has the stage to himself in a chamber program on Wednesday that includes the Septet (Op. 20) as its centerpiece. Tomorrow afternoon Julia Zilberquit plays piano music by Liadov, Medtner, Rachmaninoff and Tcherepnin, and tomorrow evening and on Sunday afternoon, Dmitry and Anya Alexeev pick up this Russian thread in a program of piano works by Balakirev, Liadov and Medtner, with a piano four-hands version of Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' as its conclusion. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 1 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students; $30 for 65+ tonight and on Thursday. (Allan Kozinn) CONNECTICUT EARLY MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight and Sunday) This annual three-week feast of early music, slightly spare yet charming in the best New England tradition, begins this weekend with what you could call song and dance. Tonight the vocal trio Liber Unusualis performs mystical songs from the 14th and 15th centuries; on Sunday Vivaldi's complete ''Estro Armonico,'' a groundbreaking sequence of 12 concerti, will be performed in the original chamber instrumentation. Tonight at 8, Enders Island Chapel, Mason's Island, Mystic; Sunday at 6 p.m., Christ the King Church, Old Lyme, (860) 444-2419, ctearlymusic.org; $20 to $26. (Midgette) * DA CAPO CHAMBER PLAYERS (Tonight) The innovative Da Capo Chamber Ensemble concludes its 36th season with ''Sonic Brew,'' a lively program of contemporary works featuring David Lang's ''Sweet Air''; Randall Woolf's ''No Luck, No Happiness''; Beth May's ''Gloaming''; Jefferson Friedman's ''78''; Jacob ter Veldhuis's ''Grab It!''; John Halle's ''Free People''; and Marc Mellits's ''Spam.'' At 7:30, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com or dacapochamberplayers.org; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer) * EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) For their Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall, these superb musicians are presenting a complete cycle of the Beethoven quartets, but in a much larger framework. These seminal works are being performed alongside pieces by composers from Bach to Kaija Saariaho, whose ''Terra Memoria'' has been commissioned especially for this occasion. Sunday's program juxtaposes Beethoven's ''Harp'' and ''Serioso'' Quartets with works by Anton Webern and Bartok's teeming Third Quartet. The Emerson, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary with this series, sounded in top form for the first concert. The one drawback is Carnegie Hall, which for all its acoustical glory, is not an ideal space for an intimate string quartet experience. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to $79. (Anthony Tommasini) * ENSEMBLE ACJW (Tomorrow) Earlier this year Carnegie Hall, the Weill Music Institute and the Juilliard School jointly instituted a visionary program to train outstanding young musicians on the verge of professional careers and integrate them into the music programs of selected New York City public schools. The emerging artists have been showcased this spring in several concerts at Carnegie Hall. The next one is tomorrow night, an exciting and ambitious program with large-scale works by Webern, Ligeti, Henri Dutilleux, Mauricio Kagel and John Adams (the Chamber Symphony). But the sponsors should strongly consider coming up with a better name for this talented roster of players. At 7 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org, $15. (Tommasini) MANNES BEETHOVEN INSTITUTE (Tonight) This weeklong program of instruction, lectures and concerts, which ends on Sunday, has been dealing mainly with Beethoven's chamber music. Tonight's faculty concert offers the Piano Trio in D from Op. 70; the Piano Sonata in E (Op. 109), with Claude Frank; and the Brentano String Quartet playing the late E flat Quartet (Op. 127). At 8, Mannes College the New School for Music, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212) 580-0210, newschool.edu/mannes/bi; $20. (Bernard Holland) NEW YORK PHILARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) Riccardo Muti may not be coming to the Philharmonic as music director, but he does drop by periodically, and he is doing so right now. Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday, music by Cherubini and Hindemith frames a performance of Beethoven's ''Emperor'' Concerto with the pianist Lang Lang providing the flash. Mr. Muti reappears with a new program of Rossini, Schubert and Dvorak on Thursday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $38 to $106. (Holland) * St. Luke'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) ''Unbound'' is the title of the second program in ''Notable Women,'' St. Luke's chamber festival celebrating female composers. It denotes women who have sufficiently freed themselves of the stigma of being female -- evidently still something of a handicap in a field that remains around 80 percent male -- to achieve success. They include Jennifer Higdon, Libby Larsen and Joan Tower, who has organized the whole festival as a way to promote discussion and, on a practical level, a new burst of ''old-girl'' networking. The first performance of a commissioned work by Kati Agócs is also on the program. Tomorrow at 2 p.m., Chelsea Art Museum, 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; Sunday at 3 p.m.,Dia:Beacon, Beacon, N.Y., (212) 594-6100, oslmusic.org; $20. (Midgette) WESTERN WIND (Tonight) This vocal ensemble has performed an enormous repertory over the years, from ancient to modern works, with occasional excursions into pop and theater music offsetting their more typical classical programs. Its current program is all contemporary music, and includes the world premiere of ''Basket Rondo,'' written for the group by Meredith Monk. Scores by Philip Glass, Tania León, William Bolcom, Robert Dennis, Matthew Harris, Eric Salzman, Gayla D. Morgan and one of the ensemble's singers, Elliot Z. Levine, are also included. At 8, Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 873-2848, westernwind.org; $25; $15 for students and 65+. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Tonight, tomorrow and Monday through Thursday) The company's controversial new production of ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' filled with equal moments of beauty and wrongheadedness, will be performed tonight and tomorrow. Tonight's cast features Irina Dvorovenko (Aurora) and Maxim Belotserkovsky (Désiré), followed by Gillian Murphy and David Hallberg tomorrow afternoon, and Diana Vishneva and Mr. Hallberg in the evening. Kenneth MacMillan's ''Manon'' moves in next week. (Through July 7.) Take your pick.

(Dunning) DANCE AT DNA (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday) This weekend the Stefanie Nelson Dance Group performs an interactive multimedia dance inspired by the antics of Alice in Wonderland. On Thursday Neta Pulvermacher's Neta Dance Company performs a new trilogy that laughs at death, set to music by Elvis Presley and featuring a bluebird chandelier. (Through June 17.)

(Dunning) DANCEMOPOLITAN AT JOE'S PUB (Thursday) ''Villains and Heroes, the 100 most influential people who (n)ever lived,'' is a suite of dances inspired by the favorite villains and heroes of the choreographers who are performing. The dancers are former members of Stephen Petronio's company, and Mr. Petronio himself is the evening's host. (Through June 15.) At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Dunning) * Food for Thought (Tonight through Sunday night) Downtown dance performances can feel as if they happen in a bubble, but this weekend you can have your art and be an activist too, as Food for Thought features three evenings organized by Irene Hultman, Jonah Bokaer and Gina Gibney. At 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $5 with two cans of food, or $10. (Claudia La Rocco) RISA JAROSLOW (Thursday) Ms. Jaroslow's solo, ''A Jew in Poland,'' addresses the destruction of old Jewish communities in that country. It is being performed in connection with an exhibition, ''And I Still See Their Faces: The Vanished World of Polish Jews,'' and will be followed by a discussion with the choreographer-performer. At 7 p.m., Yeshiva University Museum, 15 West 16th Street, Flatiron district, (917) 606-8200, yumuseum.org; $8; $6 for students and 65+.

At 8, Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts at Long Island University, Brooklyn Campus, Flatbush and DeKalb Avenues, downtown Brooklyn, (718) 488-1264, 651ARTS.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Movement Research at the Judson Church (Monday) It's the last chance this season to catch experiments in movement from some of today's most inquisitive artists. This week catch Ivy Baldwin, Sujin Lee and Paul Singh. At 8 p.m., 55 Washington Square South, South Village, (212) 598-0551, movementresearch.org; Free. (La Rocco) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The big news is the premiere tonight of Christopher Wheeldon's new work ''The Nightingale and the Rose,'' set to music by Bright Sheng, the company's resident composer, and starring Wendy Whelan, Sara Mearns and Tyler Angle. Tonight's program, ''Tradition and Innovation,'' also includes Peter Martins's ''Jeu de Cartes'' and ''Robert Schumann's 'Davidsbundlertanze' '' and, oddly, the Rosenkavalier section of ''Vienna Waltzes,'' by George Balanchine. Other programs are the ''one-time-only'' combination of Mr. Wheeldon's new ballet, Balanchine's ''Union Jack'' and ''Rubies'' from Balanchine's ''Jewels,'' danced for the first time by Megan Fairchild and the delicious Joaquin De Luz. Completing the week's repertory are ''Three By Bach'' (Balanchine's ''Concerto Barocco,'' Christopher d'Amboise's ''Tribute'' and Jerome Robbins's ''Brandenburg''), tomorrow night; ''Essential Balanchine'' (''Walpurgisnacht Ballet,'' ''Liebeslieder Walzer'' and ''Symphony in Three Movements,'' on Sunday); the Balanchine classic ''Jewels'' (Tuesday and Thursday); and ''Balanchine and Robbins: Masters at Work'' (Balanchine's ''Raymonda Variations'' and ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto'' and Robbins's ''Dybbuk,'' on Wednesday. (Through June 24.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p. m. New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $86. (Dunning) NOCHE FLAMENCA (Tonight through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) It's back, with a new piece called ''Aldaba'' and the company star, Soledad Barrio, she of unfailing fire. (Through July 29.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 5 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 352-3101, theatremania.com; $55. (Dunning) JODY OBERFELDER DANCE PROJECTS (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Oberfelder, known for her acrobatic, high-energy dance mixed with glints of humor, will present her new ''Heavy Light,'' inspired by Horace Walpole's notion that life is a comedy for thinkers and a tragedy for those who feel, and ''The Title Comes Last,'' in which performers travel from a workaday world into ''a land of vibrancy.'' Take us with you. (Through June 17.) At 7 p.m., The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org; $20; $12 for students and 65+; $175 to $250 for the gala on Wednesday, including reception and postperformance dinner.

(La Rocco) SENS/NOÉMIE LAFRANCE (Thursday) Ms. Lafrance, known for visually dramatic site-specific dance, will present performances of a work in progress called ''Rapture,'' in which dancers travel across stainless-steel roofs and walls in a response to the architectural design of Frank Gehry's Fisher Center. (Through June 16.) At 8 p.m., Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College, Annandale on the Hudson, N.Y., (575) 758-7900, fishercenter.bard.edu.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * brooklyn museum: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this assembly of pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn't venture beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith) * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Michael Kimmelman) * International Center of Photography: 'Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS:THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at Cézanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) * THE MET: 'Poiret: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith) * El Museo del Barrio: 'The Disappeared (Los Desaparecidos),' through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'Richard Serra Sculpture: 40 Years,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in work he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman) THE NATIONAL ACADEMY: '182ND ANNUAL: AN EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY ART,' through July 24. The National Academy has mounted annual exhibitions showcasing living American artists (as opposed to dead Europeans) since it was founded in 1826. The annuals now alternate between invitationals, including nonmembers, and years devoted to academicians, professional artists elected by their peers to be members of the National Academy. This is a members-only year, which means that the work is more conservative -- or ''traditional,'' if you like. Heavily weighted toward painting, the exhibition includes lots of heirs to Abstract Expressionism and scores of competent figurative paintings and Expressionist- and Impressionist-inspired still lifes and landscapes. Among the participants are Philip Pearlstein, William Bailey, Will Barnet, Melvin Edwards, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Richard Estes and Lois Dodd. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Schwendener) WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: Matthew Brannon, 'Where Were We,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Summer of Love: Art of the PsychedElic Era,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown 'CONCEPTUAL PHOTOGRAPHY: 1964-1989' By now some of the freewheeling, sometimes prankish specimens of photography styled Conceptual, rampant in the '60s and '70s, have become classics, as this wide-ranging show proves. The more than 35 projects on view, drawn from a private collection, include works by many of the usual suspects: Vito Acconci, Bruce Nauman, Giuseppe Penone, John Baldessari and Charles Ray. Among those on display here that have stood the test of time are Nauman's witty explorations of his body, like ''Self-Portrait as Fountain'' (1966); Ray's ''Plank Piece I, II'' (1973), in which he helps a board make sculpture of his body; and Penone's ''To Reverse One's Eyes'' (1970), embellishing his sight through lenses made of mirrors. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, through June 23. (Glueck) 'CROSSCURRENTS: DURER TO PICASSO' A show of prints and drawings that makes imaginative pairings of older works with those of 20th-century artists who are sometimes cued by their contemporaries as well as their ancestors. The evidence is keen in, for example, Hieronymus Bosch's ''Temptation of St. Anthony'' (1561), a fervidly drawn scene of grotesque beings and fantastic doings placed near two later Surrealist renditions: a biomorphic figment by Andre Masson, ''The Genius of the Species'' (1942), and Salvador Dalí's etching ''Landscape in the Manner of Arcimboldo'' (1934), a biomorphic-geometric vision. A beguiling show. David Tunick, 19 East 66th Street, (212) 570-0090, through June 15. (Glueck) 'SUBLIME CONVERGENCE: GOTHIC TO THE ABSTRACT' This gathering of old master and contemporary paintings reminds us how the art of the past can resonate with that of the present. The emphasis is on the spiritual, with objects by a number of medieval gold-ground painters -- who covered panels with gold leaf to form a radiant background for their imagery -- dramatically displayed along with more recent art of a meditative nature. (Gregorian chant plays softly in the background.) One salient example is Taddeo di Bartolo's ''St. Francis of Assisi'' (about 1395), with its simple Gothic niche as background for the saint in his nuanced bluish-gray robe, accompanied by Brice Marden's ''Number 1'' (1963), another Minimalist composition of four gridded rectangles, each bluntly painted in a shade of gray, that seems to reflect the intensity of the earlier picture. Comparisons like this can go awry, but for the most part this show works. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through June 15. (Glueck) Galleries: 57th Street * PICASSO, BRAQUE AND EARLY FILM IN CUBISM Cubism and the first moving pictures emerged in the same decade. Coincidence? This thrilling exhibition doesn't think so. A dense display of major paintings, collages and prints; antique cameras and projectors; and snippets of film that Braque and Picasso are thought to have seen, it examines Cubism in the dim light and flickering images of the movie theater. It is radically reorienting to consider Cubism's fractured, revolving forms and transparencies as partly influenced by moving pictures. A few of the pictures even resemble movie cameras. Weirdest of all? Thinking of Analytical Cubism's pale, gleaming dabs of paint as dust motes caught in the projector's beam. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, through June 23. (Smith) Marc Quinn: 'Sphinx' This amusing, if somewhat disturbing, show presents Kate Moss as equal parts classical Greek sculpture, yoga devotee and SuperModel. It strikes a particularly contemporary chord in the way it addresses contemporary society's obsession with looking good and its confusion about how to get the inside (feelings, spirit, thoughts) to match the outside. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 752-2929, through June 30. (Bridget L. Goodbody) Galleries: SoHo TINA BARNEY: CHINA VISIT Tina Barney's last series of photographs featured a nearly extinct species, the European aristocracy, while her new works look to China. Most of the photographs feature members of the creative class, from actors and dancers to a jingle composer, although several juxtapose the ''old'' China with the ''new,'' Westernized version, seen through the filter of opera performers or female golf caddies posed against an urban backdrop. These are more posed and less intimate than Ms. Barney's photographs of her own upper-crust East Coast tribe, which made her famous in the 1980s. But the implications of this project are obvious, with China's growing position on the world's political and economic stages. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, between Prince and Spring Streets, SoHo, (212) 431-0166, www.janetbordeninc.com; through June 16. (Schwendener) Galleries: Other * MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: PREIS bilder Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, www.1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) Last Chance JOAQUÍN TORRES-GARCÍA: 'paintings and drawings, 1920-1942' This choice exhibition concentrates on small, lively ink drawings from the early 1930s, when Torres-García ironed out Cubism into a compartmentalized grid that could either be abstract -- like Mondrian's work -- or a container for assorted symbols and hieroglyphs. Two earlier paintings underscore that, either way, his inspiration came from combined order and disorder of bustling city views. CDS Gallery, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' . This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Smith) YAYOI KUSAMA: FROM HERE TO INFINITY Spanning 50 years, this 24-piece overview is notable for its high quality and for unfamiliar works that sharpen the understanding of this artist's protean talent, among them several small, pungently colored folk-arty paintings that deploy her signature (and obsessive) webs, dots and scale patterns as effectively as her more abstract works do. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190; closes today. (Smith) MARGUERITE ZORACH: A LIFE IN ART The first solo show in more than 30 years of a pioneer of European modernism in America contains 35 paintings -- landscapes, portraits and still lifes -- ranging in date from 1910 to the mid-1960s. They're not all equally good, but they all have a quality of grit, intelligence and striving that never falters. The next show should also include her textiles and works on paper. Gerald Peters Gallery, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760, www.gpgallery.com; closes today. (Smith)"

2007-06-08T00:00:00Z,"That was quick. Paris Hilton, the 26-year-old heiress who was jailed Sunday night for a probation violation, was released in the early hours yesterday to serve the rest of her sentence at home. At a hastily arranged news conference, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department offered the cryptic explanation that a ''medical situation'' was the reason for her release. ''She has been fitted with an ankle bracelet and sent home, and will be confined to her home for the next 40 days,'' said the spokesman, Steve Whitmore. Ms. Hilton, in a statement released by her lawyer, said, ''I have learned a great deal from this ordeal and hope that others have learned from my mistakes.'' She also thanked authorities ''for treating me fairly and professionally.'' Her sentence, imposed when she was caught driving with a license suspended from a reckless driving case, had been reduced to 23 days at the correctional facility, a two-story concrete building southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Now that she will serve time at her more comfortable West Hollywood home, the sentence reverts to the original 45 days, minus the five days she served since Sunday. SHARON WAXMAN"

2007-06-08T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''In Cajun Country, a Fight to the Finish'' (June 1): The struggle in Louisiana's legislature over exactly how and when to outlaw the barbaric practice of cockfighting is certainly a topic worthy of reporting and analysis in your news pages. But it is hardly an appropriate subject for the Escapes section, complete with advice about which restaurants to eat at on one's way to witness this disgusting sport before a new ban goes into effect. Would you run a travel story telling people which hotels to stay in while on their way to gawk at homeless people in Calcutta or soccer hooligans in Leeds? Notwithstanding our hurricanes, there are still lots of worthwhile sites to visit in Louisiana. Surely The Times could do better than to endorse this sort of slumming. Stuart P. Green Baton Rouge, La. To the Editor: It is very disturbing that The Times saw fit to publish an article about the cruel practice of cockfighting in the Escapes section. That this barbaric ''sport'' is illegal in 49 states is a recognition that it inflicts agony on living, breathing beings. The story itself is troubling, but your placement of it among travel and vacation articles suggests that cockfighting is a worthy leisure-time activity and that one should hurry to see a match before an American tradition is gone forever. There is nothing romantic about an activity where roosters are honed as killing machines and viewers scream for blood. Carolyn Silvers New York, N.Y. To the Editor: I find it remarkably sad and extremely ironic that we continue to debate and pass laws that prohibit cockfighting in the United States under the auspices of animal cruelty, when other more hideous acts of cruelty exhibited toward animals occur daily. The final product of these endeavors quite literally appears right under our very noses at the dinner table. The acts of cruelty that surely occur within the cockfighting subculture hardly warrant any comparison to the horrors exhibited in the United States factory farming industry. Both industries are motivated by profit and greed; factory farming, however, is supported by federal and local governments and you, the taxpayer and consumer. This industry continues to unnecessarily systematically torture and senselessly abuse animals while we consume its meat, dairy and apparel byproducts while sadly we remain callous to this repugnant and absolutely unnecessary suffering.

''The goal is to make people realize what sketch comedy is,'' said Alexander Zalben, a producer of Sketchfest NYC.

''We weren't going to aim for being the biggest,'' Mr. Zalben said. ''It's more important to aim for a consistent level of quality.''

The London dealer Giuseppe Eskenazi said he bought the work, dating from the first century B.C. to the first century A.D., on behalf of a private European collector whom he declined to identify. Sotheby's had estimated that the sculpture would go for $5 million to $7 million. The sculpture had been in the collection of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, which is in the midst of a controversial sale of older works so that it can raise money to finance purchases of contemporary art. Richard M. Keresey, an antiquities specialist at Sotheby's, had called the 36-inch-tall bronze ''the best single piece I've seen here in 37 years.'' The previous auction record for a sculpture was set in May 2005 when Brancusi's ''Bird in Space'' went for $27.5 million at Christie's in New York; the previous auction record for an antiquity was the $11.6 million paid for the so-called Jenkins Venus, a marble statue, at Christie's in London in June 2002. Reached on his cellphone Mr. Eskenazi said that he jumped into the bidding after the price reached $14 million and then squared off against one remaining bidder. ''He was very determined -- I thought he'd never give up,'' he said. ''I feel exhaustion, to be honest.'' Mr. Eskenazi triumphed with a hammer price of $25.5 million. (Final prices include Sotheby's commission: 20 percent of the first $500,000 and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.) Akon in Trouble The platinum-selling singer Akon, above, is under investigation after a clash that ended with him tossing a teenage concertgoer off the stage and onto an audience member who said she suffered a concussion, The Associated Press reported. Witnesses said the trouble erupted Sunday at Dutchess Stadium in Fishkill, N.Y., where a spectator threw something at the singer, and Akon, 34, asked the crowd to point out the culprit. A guard singled out a 15-year-old boy, whose name was not released, and sent him to the stage, where Akon hurled him into the audience, The Poughkeepsie Journal reported. The boy landed on Abby Rosa, who said she soon experienced a headache and blurry vision. Detective Lt. John Berlingieri of the Fishkill Police said no criminal charges had yet been filed. Earlier this year Akon caused a furor with a sexually explicit onstage dance with a girl later revealed to be 14. He apologized, saying he did not know she was under-age. Sean Connery Resigns His Professorship Sean Connery said yesterday that he won't be playing dad to Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones anymore, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Connery, 76, played Prof. Henry Jones, father of the intrepid archeologist, in the 1989 adventure ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' below. With a fourth Indian Jones film, directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by George Lucas, scheduled to go before the cameras this month, speculation had mounted that Mr. Connery would return, although he had announced his retirement from acting in 2005. ''I thought long and hard about it, and if anything could have pulled me out of retirement, it would have been an Indiana Jones film,'' he said in a statement posted on the Lucasfilm Indiana Jones Web site (www.indianajones.com). ''But in the end, retirement is just too damned much fun.'' The film is scheduled for release in May 2008. Patricia Cornwell Wins Injunction A federal judge in Richmond, Va., has ordered Leslie R. Sachs, a self-published author, to end an Internet vendetta that leveled accusations of plagiarism, bribery and anti-Semitism against Patricia Cornwell, below, the best-selling author of novels featuring the medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Sachs even contended that Ms. Cornwell was plotting to have him murdered. Ms. Cornwell, 50, said Mr. Sachs, 52, had made no direct threats but said his allegations had caused her fear, anxiety and sleeplessness. After long ignoring him she sued Mr. Sachs for libel when the Internet attacks increased. Judge Norman K. Moon granted Ms. Cornwell's motion for a permanent injunction, saying that the statements were false and ''calculated to expose plaintiff to public contempt or ridicule'' and were published with actual malice. Mr. Sachs did not immediately respond to an e-mail message from The Associated Press seeking comment. British 'Big Brother' Contestant Expelled An allegation of racism has led to the ouster of a contestant from the British reality television show ''Big Brother,'' The Associated Press reported. Emily Parr, 19, a student, was removed after using a derogatory term about a black contestant on Wednesday night, Channel 4 in Britain said yesterday. The remark was not broadcast live. Channel 4 was forced to apologize two weeks ago after regulators ruled that the ''Celebrity Big Brother'' program violated broadcasting rules by showing footage of racist insults directed at the Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty. Channel 4 said that in light of reaction to the ''Celebrity Big Brother'' incident it had not choice but to expel Ms. Parr."
2007-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Perry Rubenstein Gallery is serving a cocktail of knockout works by Robin Rhode, a South African-born, Berlin-based artist known for his brilliantly inventive, performance-related artwork. Spread over all three of the gallery's Chelsea spaces, the works take their inspiration from hip-hop music, sports, film and fashion. Standouts include ''Table of Contents'' (2006), a stylish, pyramid-shaped sculptural installation of 36 photographs of the artist playing a game of shadow table tennis with himself on a table spray-painted on a wall. Mr. Rhode paints a representation of a light-colored ball in motion, positioning himself holding a paddle for the next shot. The photographs trace the game's progression. It is fun, devilishly clever and simple, reaffirming his leadership among the latest generation of performance-based artists. He uses the same low-tech, stop-frame animation formula to an equally satisfying effect for ''Juggla'' (2007), above, a display of photographs of himself in a top hat and cape, juggling imaginary balls painted on a wall. Nearby is his first short film, ''Candle'' (2007), a blurry dream adventure in which he lights and somehow controls a live candle flame. It is austerely beautiful, like most everything else in these lovely shows. (Through June 23, Perry Rubenstein Gallery, 527 West 23rd Street, 526 West 24th Street, 534 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-8000, perryrubenstein.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO"

2007-06-08T00:00:00Z,"With good reason, the city of Vienna holds a distinguished place in the history of classical music. Its jazz legacy is much more difficult to pin down, but there have been significant advances in recent years. The city now has a handful of noteworthy clubs, including Joe Zawinul's Birdland, owned by Austria's best-known jazz musician. (He recorded his latest release, ''Brown Street,'' at the club in 2005.) Naturally, there's also a Vienna Jazz Festival, which began in 1991; this year's edition kicks off on June 25. And there have been an increasing number of collaborations between Vienna-based musicians and their American counterparts; one of the newest and best is ''Friendly Travelers'' (Material), by the guitarist Wolfgang Muthspiel and the drummer Brian Blade. The Mostly Jazz Festival, presented by the Austrian Cultural Forum in Midtown Manhattan, celebrates this spirit of transnational exchange even as it makes the case for an independent Austrian jazz aesthetic. '' 'No boundaries' seems to be the unspoken motto of musicians in Vienna,'' writes Helge Hinteregger, the festival's curator, in a program essay. (He doesn't say whether the titular echo of Mostly Mozart, Lincoln Center's venerable festival, is fully intentional, though it probably is.) The series begins tonight with Big Four, consisting of the veteran Austrian saxophonist Max Nagl, the Paris-born guitarist Noël Akchoté and two Americans, the trumpeter Steven Bernstein and the bassist Brad Jones. They perform at 7, followed by an inventive young trio called Kelomat, above, led by the saxophonist Wolfgang Schiftner. Tomorrow there's another group featuring Mr. Schiftner, aptly named Vienna-New York Connection and including the saxophonist Tony Malaby. As for Mr. Nagl, he resurfaces on Tuesday with a project he calls Wumm Zack. The early slot tomorrow goes to Bassinstinct, an assembly of six double bassists. And on Monday, the pianist Hannes Löschel will entrust his own compositions to several well-qualified American improvisers -- the multireedist Ned Rothenberg, the guitarist David Tronzo and the bassist Lindsay Horner -- before a set of free improvisation by the saxophonist Clemens Salesny and the pianist Clemens Wenger.

(ABC) RUFFIAN (2007) Right on the heels of the Belmont Stakes (5:30 p.m. on ABC), and with the memory of Barbaro still fresh, comes this drama about the horse heralded as the greatest thoroughbred filly of all time. After winning the Filly Triple Crown early in 1975, the undefeated Ruffian went on to run a “battle of the sexes” match against the Kentucky Derby winner Foolish Pleasure on July 6 at Belmont Park. The race ended in sorrow when, with Ruffian leading Foolish Pleasure by half a length, two bones in her right front leg snapped. After a 12-hour surgery, Ruffian caused further damage to herself when she thrashed around on the floor of her padded stall, and she was euthanized shortly after. The film, directed by Yves Simoneau (HBO’s “Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee”), stars Sam Shepard, above, as Frank Whiteley, the trainer who guided Ruffian’s ascent, and Frank Whaley as the sportswriter Bill Nack, who wrote the book the movie is based on."

2007-06-09T00:00:00Z,"Norilsk Nickel, the Russian nickel and palladium producer, said its profit more than doubled in 2006, as a result of soaring metals prices. Norilsk reported net profit of $5.99 billion, up from $2.36 billion in 2005, mostly because of a run-up over the period in the price of nickel. Analysts said growth in demand for steel in China was driving the increase. Revenue was $11.55 billion, up from $7.17 billion. Anticipating the jump in profits, two investment banks in Moscow issued reports last week identifying Norilsk's stock as undervalued. Still, the company is in the midst of a potentially destabilizing change in ownership as the two principal Russian shareholders are unwinding a decade-long partnership. Norilsk produces a fifth of all nickel and half of all palladium in the world at its mine above the Arctic Circle in Siberia. ANDREW KRAMER"

Valuable mineral resources like diamonds, oil and gold have spawned and fueled vast conflicts across Africa for decades, and the research in Ivory Coast demonstrated how a valuable cash crop can play a similar role, Global Witness said.

Pecking Order for Artists The German painter Gerhard Richter, below, enjoys the highest reputation of any living artist, followed by the American installation artist Bruce Nauman, according to an index compiled by the German magazine Capital, Bloomberg News reported. Art Compass (Kunstkompass), which the magazine has published annually since 1970, asks museum curators, critics and others to rank artists according to prestige; the index doesn't measure sales or prices. The German painter Sigmar Polke took third place, followed by the conceptual artist Rosemarie Trockel, the sculptor Louise Bourgeois and the photographer Cindy Sherman. The biggest gainer in this year's survey was Isa Genzken, a sculptor and installation artist living in Berlin who is responsible for this year's German Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. She jumped 69 slots to move into 90th place. A New Boss For Berlin Museums Hermann Parzinger, an archaeologist, was named yesterday to run Berlin's museums, libraries and archives, replacing Klaus-Dieter Lehmann in March.

Mr. Michael, 43, told the court he was ashamed that ''I had done something really wrong in putting other people at risk.''

The existence of the archives, discovered in 2000 in a vacant Vienna apartment, became widely publicized only in recent weeks. Yet the International Commission for Holocaust Era Insurance Claims finished its work in March, while a settlement with the Italian insurer Generali was completed in February, with some exceptions. ''We believe the records may contain asset information of two-thirds of the Austrian Jewish community,'' said Sam Dubbin, a lawyer for the Miami-based Holocaust Survivors Foundation U.S.A. Ingo Zechner, director of the Holocaust Victims Information and Support Center in Vienna, said that the archives contained no insurance or bank records. Still, Mr. Dubbin said, survivors, who in any case wish to learn their families' fates, ''are skeptical, because to date every institution holding information about their past and their assets has concealed relevant information.''

2007-06-10T00:00:00Z,"Whimsical and melancholic, playful and heavy as a heart swollen with emotion, Jean-Luc Godard's 1965 film ''PIERROT LE FOU'' opens with Jean-Paul Belmondo sitting in a bathtub, a cigarette stuck in his mouth, a book clutched in his hands. He's reading about the Spanish painter Velázquez, but what he's really doing is, much as the Good Witch of the North does in ''The Wizard of Oz,'' showing us the road we're to follow: ''Past the age of 50,'' Mr. Belmondo reads, ''Velázquez stopped painting definite things. He hovered around objects with the air, with twilight, catching in his shadows and airy backgrounds the palpitations of color, which formed the invisible code of his silent symphony.'' Mr. Godard was only 34 when he made ''Pierrot le Fou,'' but he was already looking back at the past (including his 1959 feature debut ''Breathless,'' with its movie shots heard round the world), and gazing ahead. Nominally based on the Lionel White novel ''Obsession,'' the film finds Mr. Belmondo as a married man on the lam with the dangerously lovely Anna Karina (then Mrs. Godard) in a self-conscious pantomime of l'amour fou. In between definite things, like stolen cars and bursts of red, there are glorious, witty bits of dialogue, snatches of music, furtive and loving moments (with Picasso, Renoir and van Gogh), splashes of Piet Mondrian yellow, blue and red, invocations of cinema (''Pépe le Moko''), in other words, as Mr. Belmondo explains at one point, a film with ''space feeling.'' ''Pierrot le Fou'' will be presented in a new 35-millimeter print, and there is word that a new Criterion edition is in the works. ''Breathless'' is also being shown for an extra Belmondo-Godard treat.

If the Brattons turn out to be greater at Virginia than the Gaits were at Syracuse two decades ago, then we will have seen not only a pair of African-American stars in a predominantly white game, but also two individuals who revolutionized the sport once again. David Bernklau Brooklyn To the Sports Editor: Rhamel Bratton referred to lacrosse as being more laid-back than football, but perhaps that is only in terms of organized practice time. In execution, lacrosse is anything but laid-back. It is one of the most demanding team sports and players have to be excellent athletes; the Bratton twins are tremendous. Fiona D. J. Bayly New York"

Earlier this year, the photographer Jehad Nga, on assignment for the Travel section, spent three weeks retracing part of the historic route in central Asia, driving from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, to Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Conditions were at times onerous, ranging from oppressive desertlike heat in Uzbekistan to a blizzard in Tajikistan that made that country's already treacherous roads nearly impossible to navigate. But it was also a journey of discovery: of encountering Kyrgyz sheepherders living in bare-existence yurts set in the vast wilderness; of witnessing an Uzbek bride's joyful preparation for her wedding; of shopping in the historic central bazaar of Samarkand, Uzbekistan."

ARTISTS'' at the Hammer Museum, a generational sampling of local talent.

2007-06-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''Concert Hall? How About Music Museum?'' [June 3]: In his stimulating essay Lawrence Kramer asks why classical music still matters. I would be more specific: Why does going to a classical music concert still matter, since the music may be heard anywhere via iPod or CD? I've performed classical music in concert and have recorded the same music. The difference is huge. At a concert there are likely to be more risks taken, more new ideas instantly realized, and more deeply emotional playing in response to an audience. This is not the case in the studio, where care and consistency are the rule. No matter what electronic apparatus we have in our homes, or carry with us, the concert hall is the beating heart of classical music, and it matters enormously.

This 216-acre property with 34 sprawling Mediterranean-style luxury condominium buildings sits conveniently surrounded by Miami Beach, the city of Miami, Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. It is an island paradise containing every possible indulgence that someone with a great deal of money and an enormous need to be coddled might desire. Fisher Island's fortunate 1,400, fewer than one-third of them full-time residents, can play on the golf course created by P. B. Dye, of the famed course-design family, or on one of 18 tennis courts -- clay, grass and hard court surfaces. There are two marinas -- one for large yachts and one for larger yachts -- and a state-of-the-art gym, complete with a Roman waterfall for aching backs and, along with yoga and Pilates, classes with names like Waves of Steel and Esto Es Tango! The sand on the beach is imported from the Bahamas and cleared daily of seaweed, so it is always soft and white. There are swimming pools, not just at the health spa, but also in each condo complex. Perpetually blooming tropical flowers perfume the air; caged toucans twitter in banyan trees, flamingos wade lazily in their own private pond. Kids attend a special island private school where cameras, wired into the condos, allow anxious parents to monitor their offspring from home; the playground, naturally, is gently padded."

Summer is high season for basic-cable dramas, with their 8- to 13-week seasons and relatively limited budgets (which seem to enforce a certain level of cheesiness, no matter how good the writing and acting might be). Heavyweights like ''The Closer'' on TNT (June 18) and ''Monk'' on USA (July 13) lie ahead; this week brings us the return of Denis Leary's firehouse passion play, ''RESCUE ME'' (FX, 10 p.m. Wednesday), and the second season of ABC Family's special-child show ''KYLE XY'' (8 p.m. Monday). Many questions will be answered about Kyle's origins in Monday's episode, though not the most pressing one: Why do characters possessed of superhuman intelligence always have such bad haircuts? Speaking of ''The Closer,'' a new installment of ''INSIDE THE ACTORS STUDIO'' (Bravo, 8 p.m. Monday) features Kyra Sedgwick, a k a Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson. Let's see if James Lipton has the guts to ask her about that Southern accent. For an entirely different type of conversation, check out the new season of the half-hour talk show ''SHARP TALK WITH AL SHARPTON'' (TV One, 1:30 p.m. Saturday), filmed at Levels barbershop in Brooklyn. This week's topic is a certain racial epithet -- the one that served as the title of the 1964 autobiography of Dick Gregory, one of Mr. Sharpton's guests."

2007-06-10T00:00:00Z,"TRIPLING TIGER CURTIS GRANDERSON of the Tigers leads the American League in triples with 12. If he ends up as the leader, he will break Carl Crawford's streak of three consecutive years leading the A.L. STUCK AT 99 Mark Buehrle of the White Sox (2-3, 3.99 earned run average) is set to start against the Astros today. It will be his eighth try at his 100th career victory; his last win came April 23. ROAD TEST With their victory Thursday against the Blue Jays, the Devil Rays won consecutive road games for the first time in almost a year. The Devil Rays were a major-league-worst 20-61 on the road in 2006, including 3-33 after July 1. They had not won back-to-back road games since June 16 and 17 last year at Philadelphia. NOT BAD COMPANY Steve Finley was designated for assignment by the Rockies, probably ending his 19-year career. He is one of six players with at least 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases. The others are Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, Andre Dawson, Bobby Bonds and Reggie Sanders. NO LUCK FOR SUTTON Curt Schilling of the Red Sox lost a chance at his first no-hitter Thursday against the Athletics when Shannon Stewart singled with two out in the ninth. It was Schilling's 425th career start. Don Sutton started the most games, 756, without throwing a no-hitter. PLAYERS TO WATCH The Dodgers' Juan Pierre, below, has hit .214 this month. He is hitting .269 over all, with an on-base percentage of .297. Pierre has hit below .280 only once in his major league career. But he also has not hit .300, something he accomplished in four of his first five seasons, since 2004. Despite his downturn, Pierre said last week that he would not do anything different to break a recent fly-ball tendency. Looking for a spark, the Royals promoted Joey Gathright from Class AAA, where he was hitting .328 with 21 stolen bases. Gathright has hit better than .300 in the minors before, but it has not translated to success in the big leagues. But he had six hits in his first 11 at-bats after the promotion. Pittsburgh center fielder Chris Duffy hit .292 after being moved to the No. 2 spot in the order May 23, but that was not enough to stop the Pirates from starting the Rajai Davis experiment. Davis had a 21-game hitting streak at Class AAA Indianapolis, with a .318 average and 27 stolen bases. Duffy, a left-handed batter, was hitting .239 over all. Manager Jim Tracy has promised it will not be a platoon, but Davis, a right-handed batter, hit better against right-handers. The struggles of the top prospect Andrew McCutchen at Class AA may have the Pirates looking for a longer-term solution in center. Compiled by The New York Times Statistics through Friday.

The site, overlooking 161st Street near the Grand Concourse, was planned as the gateway entrance, to be named Concourse Plaza. The plans called for a fountain in the plaza's center.

2007-06-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Corby Kummer's review of Barbara Kingsolver's ''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle'' (May 20) missed the point that the book not only offers ways American families can make food decisions in their daily lives, but also helps them think about how those decisions affect the rest of the world. Industrial farming and food aid can have disastrous effects on developing countries. While food aid and imported food purport to address the problem of hunger, they often exacerbate it by crippling local agriculture's ability to compete and be profitable. Sustainable agriculture, on the other hand, provides a long-term solution that addresses both hunger and its root cause, poverty."
2007-06-10T00:00:00Z,"FESTIVATE vi.: to pass the summer in the attendance of arts festivals, especially those of a theatrical nature (see also culture vulture). This useful verb, which has yet to make Webster's, is particularly applicable in New York between Memorial and Labor Days, when it is possible to spend every evening (and many an afternoon) at some celebratory theatrical performance or another, be it earnest (the Lincoln Center Festival) or impudent (the Pretentious Festival). Now joining, and seriously swelling, the roster of citywide theme productions is New York's first National Asian American Theater Festival, beginning with a gala on Monday and performances Tuesday through June 24. It promises to cover the boroughs as assiduously and enthusiastically as the New York-intoxicated sailors in ''On the Town'' did. Staged in locations as far-flung as La MaMa E.T.C. in the East Village and the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on Staten Island, the festival features more than 25 troupes and solo artists of Asian heritage based throughout the United States (with the expected emphasis on the left and right coasts). Some of the companies are well-known to venturesome New York theatergoers, including the National Asian American Theater Company (which is presenting its popular reinterpretation of García Lorca's ''House of Bernarda Alba''), Ma-Yi (which is restaging the Obie-winning ''Romance of Magno Rubio,'' about a Filipino migrant worker in the 1930s) and Ping Chong & Company. But expect more exotic -- yet oddly familar-sounding -- offerings from performance artists and comedy troupes. Among the titles: ''Wong Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' ''U-Hauls, Bridesmaids and Backwards Mountain,'' ''Guns and Tampons: A History of Violence Against Women I Know'' and ''The Caste & the Furious: Tokyo Drift.'' For those whose appetites range beyond the aesthetic, there is ''Cooking Con Karimi (Con Castro),'' during which, it is promised, ''the audience gets to eat free food prepared by live chefs.''

A delay in care or glitch connected to boarding can have extreme consequences for patients. ''Do they drop dead in front of you?'' Dr. Viccellio asked recently at the hospital, where he is vice chairman of emergency medicine and has practiced since 1988. ''No. But has their life permanently changed for the worse? Yes.''"

2007-06-10T00:00:00Z,"THIS spring, when the seed potatoes arrived at our local grain-and-feed store, I circled the barrels of dusty little tubers. I was talking to myself: Should I? Dare I plant a spud -- again? Mortified, our teenage daughter walked away from me, whispering, ''Give it up, Mom. It'll be the same as all the other times.'' She has been with me in the garden, bucket at the ready, as I've gently turned over the potato mounds, anticipating a bounty below. With a child's candor, she has given voice to my suppressed anguish as she peered at my stunted and scant harvests and snorted, ''Is that it?''"

AT the end of his terribly short life, Schubert composed three monumental piano sonatas. Though the Sonatas in B flat and A have become standard repertory works, the Sonata in C minor has never quite caught on. There seems to be a general perception that this stormy work is less fully realized. The finale, an episodic Allegro driven by a relentless tarantella rhythm, can sometimes seem awkward and uninspired."
2007-06-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Lawrence Kramer urges readers to ''listen to Mahler the way you would look at Klimt.'' Who looks at a Klimt nonstop for an hour or more, the length of a Mahler symphony? You can look at that Klimt for a bit, look somewhere else, return to it or not. When in its presence you have no choice but to hear that symphony. Hearing sound is coercive; you have to go to considerable lengths not to hear. Looking at images is discretionary; it is usually quite easy to look away. These differences make the notion of a music museum dubious. Rudolph H. Weingartner Pittsburgh"

There's no question about what he's handing you from piece to piece, whether it's a little suite, or a bebop song, or a ballad, or a piece of gospel, or something American Songbook-like. But he's found two good foils for his newest band, and both are tenor saxophonists. One, STACY DILLARD, comes more from the open-ended conception of Wayne Shorter; deeply beautiful improvised lines can trail off like ellipses. The other, SEAMUS BLAKE, is just as modern but a little more playful and chameleonic. The Eric Reed Quintet plays at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola this week, continuing a two-week run at the club by Mr. Reed, with two different bands. Tuesday to Sunday, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 60th Street, (212) 258-9595; $30 cover. Those following jazz ought to keep an ear on the bassist ESPERANZA SPALDING, who is going about things her own way. She's got good tone and conservatory training, but so does everyone else these days. More important, she already sounds distinct. Essentially she's a singer, using both her instrument and her voice to similar ends. Her musicality is all integrated: The Esperanza Spalding experience is light, melodic, joyful, always sort of minimalist and airborne. Recently she was at the Village Vanguard, playing Bill Evans music with the Spanish guitarist Niño Josele; this week she plays one night with her own trio (Leo Genovese, piano; Lyndon Rochelle, drums).

2007-06-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Below is a letter I've written in response to the review of my novel, ''My Holocaust'' (May 27). The letter is written in the voice of one of the minor characters in the novel, Lipman Krakowski, who sees himself, among other things, as a veteran letters-to-the-editor writer. I believe the review was wrongheaded and surprisingly ad hominem, reflected no understanding of either fiction or satire, was strikingly at odds with the many other very positive reviews that have appeared, and left your readers with a deeply and relentlessly distorted impression of my book.Tova Reich"
2007-06-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Lawrence Kramer is on to something when he suggests that a vibrant concert hall could have much in common with an excellent art museum. But he misses the mark when he laments the lack of a ''classical music equivalent of the contemporary-art market.'' The only reason a contemporary-art market exists is that art can be owned, and collectors have a pecuniary interest in escalating prices. One of the most appealing things about great music is that it belongs to all of us. Daniel Okrent Wellfleet, Mass. The writer is a former public editor of The New York Times."

Lawrence, Jr., age 88, of Wilton, CT, died peacefully at home Tuesday evening, June 5, after a short bout with pancreatic cancer, surrounded by his wife Terry and his wonderful caregivers. He had not been in his usual robust health since he suffered a stroke in 1994 which ended his lifelong love of sailing and the seas. He was born and raised in Baltimore, attended Calvert, Gilman and Canterbury Schools, worked on the Grenfell Missions. A staff sargeant in World War II, he was shot down in Ploesti and became a prisoner of War in Romania for eight months in 1944. Worked for Woods Hole Oceanographic as a seaman on The Atlantis. Married in 1961, he moved to Wilton, was a salesman for Fayette R. Plumb (Hammers and Hatchets and Axes) and later for Union Fork & Hoe (Garden Tools). He retired in 1984 and turned his interest into land conservation and preservation mainly in Wilton. He is survived by his wife Terry (46 years), his sister Emily Goodwin Kemp (Philip S., Omaha, NE) and bother Charles Goodwin III of Baltimore, MD. Plus many nieces and nephews.

2007-06-10T00:00:00Z,"SLIP SLIDING AWAY News -- Those sneakers with wheels embedded in the heels contributed to 1,600 hospital visits last year, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission says. Behind the News -- The sneakers allow children (or adults) to go from walking to rolling by shifting their weight to their heels. It's not always smooth sliding. Broken ankles, arms, feet, a concussion and possibly even one death have resulted,reported the commission, which recommends wearing helmets and knee and elbow pads with the sneakers -- just what a child wants to hear. Heelys, one of the manufacturers, has shipped more than 10 million worldwide. The company says they are much safer than biking, skateboarding or even tennis. 'A SILENT EPIDEMIC' The News -- Accidental deaths rose by more than 20 percent over 10 years ending in 2005, according to a study by the National Safety Council. Behind the News -- Accidents caused 113,000 deaths in 2005, the council said, approaching the high of 116,385 in 1969. Motor vehicle crashes were the leading cause of death and injury, followed by poisonings (including overdoses of prescription, over-the-counter and illegal drugs), falls, choking and drowning. For people up to age 41, accidents were the top cause of death, and ranked fifth in the nation over all, exceeded by heart disease, cancer, stroke and respiratory diseases. ''A silent epidemic,'' the council's president, Alan McMillan, said. LOCK AND UNLOAD The News -- About two-thirds of parents who keep a gun at home fail to store them safely, according to a study published in the medical journal Pediatrics. Behind the News -- More than 3,700 parents in 45 states, Canada and Puerto Rico were interviewed when they brought their children, ages 2 to 11, to their pediatrician for a visit. Twenty-three percent said they owned a firearm, but only one-third said that they stored their guns safely by keeping them in a locked cabinet or safe with gunlocks secured and ammunition stored separately. To the researchers, the numbers suggested that pediatricians should ask parents if guns are present in their homes and offer advice on how to store them safely. READ THE LABEL The News -- The Food and Drug Administration asked two drug makers to place prominent warnings on their diabetes medicine because they may pose increased risks of heart problems. Behind the News -- The agency's safety reviewers urged such a step last year. But F.D.A. officials didn't act until a leading medical journal reported last month that one of the drugs, Avandia, significantly increased the risk of heart attacks. Actos, the other drug, also may pose heart risks. Both treat Type 2 diabetes. The agency's commissioner, Andrew C. von Eschenbach, said he acted because ''despite existing warnings, these drugs were being prescribed to patients with significant heart failure.'' WIIOOPS The News -- A Spanish doctor, Julio Bonis, diagnosed a new medical condition after a patient complained of shoulder pain following a vigorous bout of tennis on his Wii. Behind the News -- A popular Nintendo video game console, Wii lets players punch or swing a wireless wand that translates their motions onto a television screen. There's golf, boxing, bowling, baseball, etc. The games can be quite a workout, and errant wands have caused bruises, broken windows and smashed TV screens. Now comes ''Wiitis,'' the intense shoulder pain described by Dr. Bonis in a letter last week to a leading medical journal. He prescribed ibuprofen and abstinence from the Wii. ''The patient recovered fully,'' he reported."

[Page C1.] A QUICK CHANGE -- The outsize robot adventure movie ''Transformers'' was born when the talent agency Creative Artists Agency connected Hasbro -- a client, and owner of the Transformers toy line -- with DreamWorks, Paramount and another longtime associate, Steven Spielberg, among others. But a month before the picture's release on July 4, Hasbro has jettisoned Creative Artists and jumped to the rival William Morris. [C1.] FODDER FOR THE BLOGGERS -- When representatives of the news media asked that the letters in support of I. Lewis Libby Jr., left, be released, Mr. Libby's lawyers argued against it, saying it ''needlessly risks undermining the fair administration of justice.'' Then, alluding to the sometimes combative world of online media, they added there was ''the real possibility that these letters, once released, would be published on the Internet and their authors discussed, even mocked, by bloggers.'' They were right. [C6.] NEWSPAPERS IN TURMOIL -- The McClatchy Company bought Knight Ridder and then sold pieces of it, the Tribune Company took itself private, and Rupert Murdoch has mounted a strong run at Dow Jones & Company-- all in the last year. Struggling with shrinking margins and uncertain prospects, newspapers have seen their stock prices slump, making them takeover targets. But bankers and analysts are skeptical that the takeover bids will continue. [C3.] ORGANIC BATTLE -- The latest battle over what can be called organic involves beer and gelatin, food colorings and casings for sausage. The Department of Agriculture is poised to approve a list of nonorganic ingredients that can be used in food stamped with its green-and-white organic seal. [C2.] SONY GAMES -- Sony Online intends to announce a plan to retake leadership in online gaming by unveiling three games in development. More broadly, the new games represent an attempt to expand the demographic profile of its customers while moving into the console market. [C3.] ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE -- A drug long used in Russia as an antihistamine, Dimebon, is showing what some scientists characterize as surprisingly strong results in treating Alzheimer's disease. Results of a midstage clinical trial are expected to be presented this week. [C2.] AN ONLINE PUSH -- Retailers and manufacturers like Reebok, Adidas and 1-800Flowers.com are setting up shop in Second Life, hoping that users will steer avatars to these stores and buy goods from real stores. So far, retailers have low expectations for their efforts. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. [C7.] TO EXCERPT OR PUBLISH -- Although excerpts from high-profile books routinely appear in national magazines, some publishers have been having second thoughts about the strategy. Frequently, an excerpt can offer a lift to a book's sales, but there is always the risk that it might offer too much, thus stealing thunder (and revenue) from the book. Magazine editors are now routinely exploring their options, choosing instead to run a feature about the book or an interview with the author. [C6.] HIGH SCHOOL MARKETING -- Decades after marketers began selling products by capitalizing on consumer interest in professional teams, then college teams, they are becoming big boosters of high school sports.

Beneath the electronic ache of his 2005 breakthrough hits, ''I'm Sprung'' and ''I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper),'' you could detect a sly joke about love's power. Apparently the right woman can turn any man into a robot. His new album, ''Epiphany,'' has already spawned a No. 1 hit, ''Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')''; the similarly-themed follow-up is ''Bartender,'' featuring Akon, who is one of the album's executive producers. And in the opening track, ''Tallahassee Love,'' T-Pain pays tribute both to his hometown and to Roger Troutman, the funk pioneer who helped popularize the vocal effect that T-Pain is known for."

Wooden Wand has released more than 20 albums under that name, including plenty of open-ended instrumental noodling, but ''James & the Quiet'' focuses on songs: 11 of them in 38 minutes. The melodies are straightforward and folky, mostly waltzes, and Mr. Toth sings in a knowing, slightly cracked voice along the lines of Tom Petty and T-Bone Burnett. Jessica Toth, his wife, sometimes sings harmony, and they're backed largely by acoustic instruments, but not entirely. Mr. Toth's cunning ally and producer is Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth, who slips his own psychedelically reverbed guitar into the arrangements and sometimes brings along Sonic Youth's Steve Shelley on drums. The music is sparse but cagey. And what Mr. Toth sings is verse after verse of enigma, leading to choruses like ''It's gonna be a nightmare.'' With imagery that can be biblical, down-to-earth or absurd, Mr. Toth muses on morality, bloodshed, dream journeys, death and what it's like to be ''dizzy honeybees in a bucket of tar'' -- whatever that means.

Members of Parliament and a spokesman for the speaker's party confirmed the assault and the plans for removal.

''For the global manufacturer Sony to recreate the interior of any religious building such as a mosque, a synagogue or in this case a cathedral with photo realistic quality and then encourage people to have gun battles in the building is beyond belief,'' said the Very Rev. Rogers Govender, the dean of Manchester Cathedral, who noted that three youths had been shot in the city within the past 72 hours. The church also called on Sony to contribute financially to combating the gun crime that has plagued Manchester. ''The video footage of the cathedral battle on YouTube has shocked and dismayed us beyond words,'' the dean said. Defending the game, ''Resistance: Fall of Man,'' and denying Manchester Cathedral's contention that it had not sought permission, Sony said, ''We believe we have sought and received all permissions necessary for the creation of the game.'' A spokesman said yesterday, ''We are now in contact with the cathedral authorities and will be dealing with them directly.'' Guarneri Quartet Calls It Quits After 45 years, the Guarneri String Quartet will retire at the end of the 2008-9 season. In a statement the members of the ensemble -- the violinists Arnold Steinhardt and John Dalley, the violist Michael Tree and the cellist Peter Wiley -- said they had decided that its 45th anniversary would be an appropriate time to exit. The quartet was founded in 1964 at the Marlboro Music Festival, and its personnel changed only once, in 2000, when Mr. Wiley replaced his mentor David Soyer. Violinist Turns Busker David Juritz, the 49-year-old internationally renowned violinist who is concertmaster of the London Mozart Players and guest concertmaster of the Royal Philharmonic and London Philharmonic Orchestras, has taken to the streets. During the next five months he plans to play his way across 60,000 miles in 25 countries as a busker, to raise $1 million for charities that bring music to poor children, The Times of London reported. ''Having spent the last 25 years in concert halls, I thought I would give myself something different to do,'' said Mr. Juritz, who will turn 50 during his travels. Starting out last week with an empty wallet on what he calls his ''Round the World and Bach'' tour, Mr. Juritz, who was heard on the soundtrack of ''The Last King of Scotland'' and has recorded with the Sugarbabes, said he would play mainly Bach partitas. If all goes well, he will visit Europe, Africa, Australia, India, Hong Kong and South America before finishing in the United States. ''From now until October, I will just have my backpack and violin and hope the people I play for on the street enjoy what I do enough to make a contribution,'' he said. ''I will rely on my busking earnings to finance the trip. I may have an audience of a man and a dog at some places, but I hope they like what I do.'' New Stephen King Thriller A secluded Florida key. A newly arrived bereaved mother. A madman for a neighbor. These are the ingredients of a new Stephen King thriller to be published today in the July issue of Esquire, The Associated Press reported. ''Over the last year we've been trying to breathe life back into magazine fiction,'' David Granger, the magazine's editor in chief said yesterday. ''The best way to do that is to publish nothing other than event fiction-stories that have something in addition to their literary merit to call attention to themselves.'' Mr. King's 21,000-word, 23-page novella is titled ''The Gingerbread Girl.'' Esquire has a long history of publishing original fiction, including works by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Truman Capote and Norman Mailer. Home Crowd Roots For Rolling Stones Some 60,000 fans turned out to hear the Rolling Stones perform at a British music festival for the first time in more than 30 years, when they delivered a two-hour set on Sunday night to close the Isle of Wight Festival, Agence France-Presse reported. Besides hits including ''Satisfaction,'' ''Sympathy for the Devil'' and ''Brown Sugar,'' the Stones played songs from their new album, ''A Bigger Bang,'' and featured duets with Amy Winehouse and Paolo Nutini. ''Coming back home is always like a bit more special,'' the guitarist Keith Richards, above, told Virgin Radio. ''We just carry Britain with us really, our little bubble of it.''

Ballet Theater, in a terse statement, did not describe how the burn happened or its seriousness, but appearances by Ms. Kirkland's character, the evil fairy Carabosse, are accompanied by pyrotechnics. Ballet Theater said Ms. Kirkland had been treated by doctors from the company and the Met and was taken to the emergency room at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital as a precaution. She was treated and released, and returned to work, the company said. Kristi Boone replaced her in the second act on Saturday. Ms. Kirkland joined Ballet Theater in 1974 and danced with it for 10 years. She collaborated with Kevin McKenzie, the company's director, in staging this ''Sleeping Beauty.'' DANIEL J. WAKIN"

Petrie II, our Vice President for Regulatory Affairs and Corporate Compliance Officer. Mr. Petrie was a strong and ever-calm source of expertise and excellence during his life and his 38-year tenure at the Medical Center. He will be remembered with fondness. During his distinguished career, his contributions permeated the fabric of the hospital's evolution and growth, as he rose from accounts manager and assistant controller, through a variety of critical administrative and operations positions, and then to vice president in the mid-1980s. As a member of the management team, he successfully guided our organization through innumerable accreditation surveys. Additionally, he was a Fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives. Along the way he was a mentor and friend to many-and he helped to shape the delive ry of healthcare in Queens. He focused on doing right by the patient, their concerned families, our community, and our employees. While we know his passing will bring his body peace, many will feel the loss of this man. On behalf of all our management and administration, clinical leadership and medical staff, employees, volunteers and auxilians, we offer our condolences to his family, including his beloved wife Daphne, his children John Petrie, III, M.D. and Randall Petrie, Esq., his four grandchildren, and his brothers and sisters. His sister Grace Goveia and his son John are also members of the New York Hospital Queens family. Stephen S. Mills, President and CEO John E. Sciortino, Sr. VP and COO, William G.

II, with tears in our eyes and smiles in our memories, the employees of New York Hospital Queens say farewell to our colleague and friend John A. Petrie II. Mr. Petrie was a trusted colleague and friend for 38 years and he made remarkable contributions to the growth of this hospital's capacity to take care of people. All that have had the pleasure of knowing him will miss him. Perhaps the best way we can communicate how important he has been as a person and as an influence to us is by sharing some of his words from a ceremony during which he was honored with the 2002 Healthcare Chaplaincy's Wholeness of Life Award: ''This is a special day for me. Today my colleagues and the Chaplaincy of New York are recognizing me. I say thank you for expressing kind thoughts. It is a humbling experience to stand here and listen to such accolades. Indeed, I consider myself a dedicated healthcare worker, whose adult life has been immersed in addressing the wholeness of life. Over the years, I have not used scapels or stethoscopes, but I am attuned to the beating heart of the newborn, the aching heart of the sick, and the greiving heart of the relatives and families who visit from the community... I accept this honor with humility and pride.'' His words from that special day define how Mr. Petrie lived and worked. Now it is our hearts that grieve the loss of a wonderful role model and kind friend. We offer our condolences to his family, including his beloved wife Daphne, his children John Petrie III, M.D. and Randall Petrie, Esq., his four grandchildren, and his brothers and sisters. His sister Grace Goveia and his son John are also members of the New York Hospital Queens family. The Employees of New York Hospital Queens $(6$)PETRIE--John A. II. With great sadness, the Board of Trustees of New York Hospi tal Queens mourns the passing of John A. Petrie II, Vice President for Regulatory Affairs and Corporate Compliance Officer. Mr. Petrie was the consummate professional in each of the many responsibilities he took on during his 38-year career at the Medical Center. We always counted on him to build new paths and lead the way down them. This was something he did with quiet, determined strength, and an equal dose of warmth and humor. On behalf of all our trustees, we offer our condolences to his family, including his wife, Daphne, his children, John Petrie III, M.D. and Randall Petrie, Esq., his four grandchildren, and his brothers and sisters.

While visiting here for a few days, I sniffed my way through the warrens of the medina, built in the 14th century by Portuguese and inhabited later by Muslims and Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition. Today the town's population is international, with people from Spain and France buying quaint apartments as second homes. Morocco, at the end of the spice route in Africa, developed a fine cuisine known for its pungent spice combinations. In Assilah, as in much of the country, people eat seasonally, shop at the outdoor markets, buy live chickens to have slaughtered on the spot, feathers flying helter-skelter. (In the big cities, where health inspectors and supermarkets are taking over, this is a dying custom.)

The uproar began on Monday when Mr. Rather, speaking on MSNBC by telephone, said CBS had erred in handling the evening news broadcast by ''dumbing it down, tarting it up'' and emphasizing celebrities over war coverage in ''hopes of attracting a younger audience,'' The Associated Press reported. Although he referred to Ms. Couric as a ''nice person,'' he said ''the mistake was to try to bring the 'Today' show ethos to the 'Evening News.' '' Ms. Couric, in nine months as the first woman to anchor a network news broadcast on her own, has been unable to lift ''CBS Evening News'' out of last place among the evening news programs. ''Let's give her a break,'' Mr. Moonves said at an appearance in New York where he was asked about Mr. Rather's remarks and called them ''sexist.'' He said he ''absolutely'' had confidence in Ms. Couric and the course of CBS's evening news and added that it was imperative to reach younger audiences. Unless news programs find viewers younger than 60, he said, ''the evening news will die.''

The agreement says the performance, to benefit the China Care Foundation, is expected to be attended by ''350 invitation-only guests.'' The host was identified as Raymond T. Dalio, the founder, president and chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, which has more than $30 billion in hedge-fund assets. Besides Mr. Clapton's fee for a 60- to 70-minute show, the agreement calls for a $1 million donation to ''a charity of Mr. Clapton's choice to be paid the night of the show.''

The honor is awarded once every two years to a living author for a body of work that has contributed to international fiction. Nadine Gordimer, one of three members of the judging panel that chose Mr. Achebe, said his ''early work made him the father of modern African literature as an integral part of world literature.'' She added, ''He has gone on to achieve what one of his characters brilliantly defines as the writer's purpose: 'a new-found utterance' for the capture of life's complexity.''

The jury said, ''Austere in form and profound in message, Dylan marries music and poetry in a body of work that has set an example and influenced the sentimental education of millions of people.'' The $66,000 prize will be presented at a ceremony in October. Last year's winner of the prize for art was the Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar. Despite Honors, Misery for 'Company' ''Company'' may have won the Tony Award for best revival of a musical on Sunday night, but that accolade, along with honors from the Drama Desk, the Outer Critics Circle and the Drama League, won't prevent the final curtain from falling on it on July 1.

Although the swap of the guilty plea for the time that the Game, 27, of Glendale, Calif., spent waiting to appear in court after his arrest would have ended the case, his lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, said outside Criminal Court in Manhattan: ''Why should he plead guilty to bogus charges for a non-jail sentence if he's innocent? And he is innocent.'' Judge James Burke scheduled a return court date of Sept. 20 for the Game, whose real name is Jayceon Taylor. In California he is facing charges of making a criminal threat and possessing a firearm in a school zone in an incident in February in Los Angeles. Mr. Lichtman said the Game would be on a concert tour of Europe for the next two months. Bach Books Add Up In the conclusion of a 55-year effort, German researchers have completed the final volume of a new collection of the complete works of Johann Sebastian Bach, The Associated Press reported. Christoph Wolff, director of the Bach Archive in Leipzig, said the Neue Bach-Ausgabe, or New Bach Edition, compiled by the Bach Archive and the Johann Sebastian Bach Institute in Göttingen, consists of 100 volumes. The first was published in 1953. The cantatas alone fill more than 40 volumes. Mr. Wolff said some contatas and several sonatas previously attributed to Bach had been determined not to have been written by him and were removed from the collection. He continued, ''More complicated is the content of 'The St. Luke Passion,' which as a whole has been found not to be authentic but still contains one chorus composed by Bach.'' He said the new collection includes 47 recently discovered pieces not found in Wolfgang Schmieder's Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, or BWV, generally regarded by musicians and musicologists as the standard catalog of the composer's works."

Only the coaches watched the final few innings from the dugout steps. The players stayed inside the dugout, as if they were resigned to another loss and eager to leave this place as soon as they could. Who could blame them? The last time the Mets were at Dodger Stadium, back in October, they swept the Dodgers in the division series. They have not won here since. The Dodgers outscored them, 18-5, in sweeping the three-game series, and they bashed the previously indestructible Jorge Sosa, who had started the Mets' only two victories this month, for six runs and eight hits."

Three years ago, Danic Homes, an Illinois developer, agreed to donate the house, below, to the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy, a nonprofit group that arranged for it to be dismantled. Then all the pieces -- including mahogany siding and paneling, 1950s kitchen appliances and Danish teak furniture -- were packed into trailers.

2007-06-14T00:00:00Z,"GARDENERS are as opinionated about gloves as they are about, say, whether pachysandra is good ground cover or a rampaging eyesore. Some swear by the cheapest throwaways; others have a beloved leather pair, improved, like a baseball mitt, through use. In any event, gardening gloves are as essential as a good trowel, protecting the hands against cuts (keep your tetanus shot up to date) and the blistering work of hoeing, shoveling and pushing a wheelbarrow uphill. And work it is. Gardening requires mild to moderate physical activity, and in summer, sweaty gardeners appreciate an afternoon shower as much as the tomatoes do. Some glove makers recognize this and incorporate features to increase breathability. Katherine Whiteside, the author of ''The Way We Garden Now,'' tested six pairs of gloves while building a raised-bed potager. She cautioned that ''no one pair of gloves is going to do the myriad of different tasks there are to do in the garden.'' That said, a pair of disposable latex gloves did not make the cut: ''Not one redeeming feature,'' she said. SUSAN GUERRERO"

''We have limited options, and most of them are bad,'' said Martin S. Indyk, the former United States ambassador to Israel.

2007-06-14T00:00:00Z,"THE American kitchen has been an aspirational space ever since electricity and post-World War I prosperity commingled in a nifty new appliance called the refrigerator. ''There are scads of ads from the 1920s showing people in tuxedos and evening gowns literally adoring their fridge,'' said Victoria Matranga, a historian of industrial design and the design programs coordinator at the International Housewares Association near Chicago. Then as now, Ms. Matranga said, owning the right appliance flagged your social status by showing off your understanding of technology and progress, not to mention your prowess as a breadwinner. The kitchen has also long been a very personal space, not just a place where we tell stories about who we are, but a highly functional theater for those stories (even if the stories have nothing to do with the preparation of food). Highly attuned to these fundamentals, the makers of appliances are well aware of how much the kitchen means to their customers, and so pour money and manpower into ethnographic, human science and brand identity research in an effort to learn more. (Money well spent, it seems: Americans forked over more than $15 billion on kitchen appliances last year, a 21 percent increase over the year before, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm.) This observational research is how LG learned that people were trying to jam their sports water bottles into fridge-door water dispensers and finding the standard cavity too small, leading the company to make dispensers in its new refrigerators more than 11 inches tall, the largest in the industry. And the same kind of research explains why Amana makes an oven with indented racks: its researchers noted a disturbing tendency of some bakers to scald their forearms when reaching deep in an oven to retrieve pans set at the back. Observing the human animal in its native habitat (as well as in company labs carefully constructed to look like home), corporate researchers study not only how many times these humans open their refrigerators (55 times a day, according to General Electric) and what might be the most intuitive and comfortable shape for their dishwasher handle, but how that dishwasher or refrigerator supports their idea of themselves."

Considering the price -- $5,000 to $10,000 each -- and the damage that inevitably occurs during surfing, he said, ''you'd have to be insane to use one.''"

The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, upholds most of an earlier decision by a federal judge in Brooklyn. The officials, including former Attorney General John Ashcroft and Robert Mueller, the head of the F.B.I., had asked for dismissal of the lawsuit, by Javaid Iqbal, a Pakistani immigrant, arguing in part that the government was entitled to take actions that might not have been lawful before 9/11. Although acknowledging some forms of government action in emergencies may exceed normal constitutional limits, Judge Jon O. Newman rejected the officials’ contention, saying some protections against some of the violations claimed, such as needlessly harsh confinement and ethnic discrimination, do not vary with surrounding circumstances. “The strength of our system of constitutional rights derives from the steadfast protection of those rights in both normal and unusual times,” he wrote."

Mr. Wen said Wednesday that monetary policy needed “moderate tightening,” underscoring the failure of two interest rate increases this year to slow the economy. Record trade surpluses have pumped money into the financial system, stoking investment, inflation and a stock market boom. For the first five months, industrial production climbed 18.1 percent from the period last year, up from 16.6 percent growth for all of 2006."

The militant, Mujahid Asari-Dokubu, was jailed after he declared war against the government over corrupt practices that stripped the Niger Delta of its oil wealth but failed to develop it, making the Niger Delta one of the poorest regions in Africa’s top oil producer. The release of Mr. Asari-Dokubu, a member of the influential Ijaw tribe, has been a top priority of militants in the Niger Delta, who have carried out a campaign of bombings and kidnappings that have crippled Nigeria’s oil industry, slashing output by 25 percent."
2007-06-15T00:00:00Z,"African nations agreed to a massive ivory sell-off and a nine-year freeze on further sales, moves that conservationists hoped would mean a reprieve for elephant herds from poachers and smuggling syndicates. The compromise, reached after heated negotiations lasting three weeks in The Hague, effectively called a truce in the recurring tussles between Africans wanting to cash in on stocks of accumulated tusks and those who fear that easing a 1989 trade ban will put more pressure on their dwindling elephant herds. The 171-member Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or Cites, approved the deal in what the European Union called a milestone for the wildlife trade organization. The arrangement allows South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe to empty government inventories in a single sale to Japan, which guaranteed not to re-export the raw ivory. Revenues from the sale are earmarked for conservation programs."

The money was transferred from Banco Delta Asia, a small family-owned bank in Macao, in the first step to return the money to the original account holders, the officials said. Under pressure from the United States, the Macao government in September 2005 ordered that about $25 million belonging to either North Korean state agencies or businesses with links to North Korea be frozen in the Macao bank. Diplomats working on putting into effect the agreement reached in February among North Korea, the United States, China, Japan, Russia and South Korea hope the transfer will at last revive stalled attempts to get the North to shut its nuclear facilities."

In love with the facts, laws and randomness of existence, they have shown that resolute pursuit of the Duchampian/Johnsian ideal of using anything and inventing nothing leaves art at least as wide open as life itself."

But where Mr. DeSana's exploration of the body as sexual, abject and sculptural emphasized androgyny, Ms. Brady's work deals rather explicitly and hilariously with the female predicament."

[Page A1.] MORTGAGE PROBLEMS PERSIST Delinquencies and foreclosures among homeowners with weak credit moved higher in the first quarter, but an industry report suggested that the problems have not extended into the larger pool of borrowers with stronger credit. [C1.] A TOLL ON WALL STREET The meltdown in the subprime housing market may be taking a toll on Wall Street firms. Goldman Sachs reported that profits were flat from a year ago, due to a weak mortgage market. And Bear Stearns reported a 10 percent drop in net income, excluding a one-time charge, also largely a result of the tepid mortgage market.

[C1.] BOOM FOR VENEZUELAN BANKS President Hugo Chávez repeatedly vows to do away with capitalism in Venezuela. But it turns out that Mr. Chávez's economic policies have been generating a boom for those most capitalist of institutions -- Venezuela's banks.

[C2.] DEMOCRATS PUT OFF ENERGY BILL Senate Democrats, facing their first significant battle over a wide-ranging bill aimed at reducing oil consumption, found themselves blocked by a Republican threat of a filibuster, and postponed all significant votes until next week. [A23.] LENDERS' TIES TO UNIVERSITIES Gifts and payoffs to universities and their officials by student lenders were far more pervasive than has been disclosed, and in some cases were demanded by university officials themselves in exchange for promoting lenders to students, according to a Senate report on the student loan industry.

Mr. Mallya, left, is chairman of the UB Group, an airline and liquor conglomerate, and he also owns Kingfisher Airlines. Acquisition of SpiceJet would likely speed up consolidation in the money-losing Indian airline business. [C9.] HOT STOCK MARKETS IN INDIA India's stock markets are on a roll, surpassing even the rosiest forecasts, in part because of a young, wealthy, expanding middle class banking on India's aggressive corporate growth.

2007-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Cheim & Read brightens up for summer with a dazzling display of works on paper by Joan Mitchell, the American abstract painter who lived and painted in the suburbs of Paris. Among the works on view is a selection of oil sketches on paper from the late 1950s, including the untitled 1958 work above, which all combine a bubbling energy and an angelic levity. Typically, they show a messy arrangement of explosive brush strokes. They are also surprisingly playful. Groups of watercolors and pastels from the 1970s and '80s are not so uniformly excellent, but a showing of early 1990s pastels suggests an impressive surge of creativity in her final years. The '90s pastels have a passionate intensity, so much so that they sometimes look as if they had been dashed off in a couple of minutes with a few rapid but sure twists and turns of the wrist. Then there are the fluorescent colors, which can take a little getting used to for those more familiar with the muted and more tasteful palette of her earlier years. Over all the show doesn't exactly tell us anything new about this artist, but the work is so engaging and diverting that in the end it doesn't really matter.

Next up is a reading of Joyce's letters by fans like Robert MacNeil, the former newscaster; then a dramatic interpretation of ''Finnegans Wake'' by Adam Harvey, a New Mexico actor with an incredible memory; and the premiere of ''The Antient Concert,'' a new opera by Daron Hagen and Paul Muldoon about a singing competition that Joyce, above, who aspired to be the American Idol of his day, entered. (He lost and, thankfully, kept his day job.) The evening closes with, yes, the traditional reading of the uncensored Molly Bloom, by Fionnula Flanagan. Of course a 12-hour marathon can wear down even the most devoted Joycean, in which case you can unwind much as the author did, with a pint of McSorley's ale in the Symphony Space cafe. Many of the actors stop by too. ''It gets to be a convivial day,'' Mr. Sheffer understated. ''Joyce was meant to be read aloud, I'm sure of it.'' There is only one thing you will not hear, if Mr. Sheffer has anything to do with it: a put-on Irish accent. ''I don't want it to sound like a bunch of people doing leprechaun commercials,'' he said. ''Joyce would've hated that.'' (Noon to midnight, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, 212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $14 to $25.) MELENA RYZIK"

2007-06-15T00:00:00Z,"A narrow Supreme Court majority on Thursday agreed that a lower court properly dismissed the appeal of a man who missed a federal filing deadline by three days because of a federal district judge's erroneous instructions. The defendant, Keith Bowles, who is serving a sentence of 15 years to life for murder, had argued that given the judge's erroneous instruction -- that he had 18 days to file an appeal instead of the 14 that federal law allows -- his case should come within the ''unique circumstances'' doctrine that the Supreme Court created to recognize unusual instances when jurisdictional rules need not be strictly enforced."
2007-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Strauss Operas Yield Court Drama Descendants of the composer Richard Strauss have been ordered to share royalties with heirs of the librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal, right, on nine collaborations, including the operas ''Der Rosenkavalier'' and ''Elektra,'' The Associated Press reported. In a decision made public yesterday, a court in Munich found that letters and agreements between the two men made clear that they intended to share the income. But the judges rejected requests for royalties from record sales and performances that do not include texts. In its ruling, the court cited Hofmannsthal's words. ''A work is a whole, and also the work of two people can be a whole,'' it said. ''The music should not be torn from the text, nor the word from the lively image.'' Payments to heirs of Hofmannsthal, who died in 1929, ceased in 1999 after expiration of a 70-year protection period. Because Strauss did not die until 1949, those rights are still under protection. In their petition, Hofmannsthal's descendants sought at least 25 percent of the royalties and put the amount for 2001 and 2002 alone at $997,000. The Strauss heirs must now disclose earnings, paving the way for a determination of royalties owed. The court's decision is subject to appeal. Norwegian Novelist Wins Impac Award Per Petterson of Norway and his translator Anne Born were named the winners yesterday of the 12th International Impac Dublin Literary Award. The $133,000 prize, billed as the world's richest literary award for a single work of fiction in English, honored Mr. Petterson's novel ''Out Stealing Horses,'' about an isolated 67-year-old Norwegian widower whose chance encounter with a character from his youth revives painful memories, Reuters reported. Mr. Petterson, 54, left, a bookseller before becoming an author, said, ''With money like this, it can buy a lot of time to write and no hunger for some time.'' Ms. Born will receive a quarter of the prize money. Mr. Petterson's competition included seven books, by J. M. Coetzee, Salman Rushdie, Julian Barnes, Jonathan Safran Foer, Cormac McCarthy, Peter Hobbs and Sebastian Barry. The short-listed novels were selected from 138 that were nominated by 169 library systems in 49 countries. The winning book, chosen by a panel of five international judges, was cited as a ''poignant and moving tale.'' Despite Settlement, Bias Case Goes On Frank Davis, a black assistant director fired from the set of the Universal film ''2 Fast 2 Furious,'' has settled his racial discrimination suit against the studio for an unspecified sum, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Nevertheless, the trial in Federal District Court in Los Angeles continued because the principal plaintiff, the United States Equal Opportunity Commission, decided to pursue the case. ''We are a separate party and when we sue, we sue in the public interest,'' said Anna Park, a regional attorney for the commission. ''We need to be satisfied in any resolution that the public interest is served.'' Here Comes J. K. Rowling Rock stars have their circuits, and the author of the Harry Potter novels has the J. K.

2007-06-15T00:00:00Z,"The Pennsylvania county that is home to the Barnes Foundation, the financially troubled collection of world-class art, has offered to buy the foundation's property as a way to keep the collection in its current location. Three years ago, after a prolonged legal battle, a judge ruled that the foundation could move the Barnes from the Philadelphia suburb where it has been since the 1920s to the city's downtown museum quarter as a way to increase its attendance and shore up its finances. The decision will require millions of dollars of public funds and circumvents the charter of the institution's eccentric founder, Albert C. Barnes, who stipulated that no picture could be lent, sold or even moved on the walls of the neo-Classical galleries that he had built in Merion, Pa. This week, Montgomery County proposed buying the foundation's buildings and land for $50 million or more, using money that would be raised through bonds. Under the plan, interest from the money could then be used by the Barnes both to pay the bonds' debt service and to build its endowment, allowing the art to stay put. ''This is much closer to the wishes of Dr. Barnes,'' said Mark D. Schwartz, a lawyer recently hired by the county to explore way to keep the Barnes from moving. A spokesman for the Barnes said that the foundation had only recently received the proposal and was not yet prepared to comment. RANDY KENNEDY"

Tomorrow's program begins at 2 p.m. with ''The American Nightmare,'' Adam Simon's 2000 documentary about the horror phenomenon of the '70s, which features interviews with John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper, John Landis and other seminal figures. Then, at 4 p.m., you can compare Stanley Kubrick's blithely sadistic 1971 film, ''A Clockwork Orange'' (with its consideration of rape -- at least as performed by Alex, Malcolm McDowell's character, above -- as a political act), with its glumly moralistic 21st-century cousin, ''Saw II,'' which screens at 6:30. Sunday brings Mr. Hooper's original 1974 ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,'' with its garish, paranoid portrait of a demented, ingrown middle America, represented by a family of laid-off slaughterhouse workers who take out their resentment on a traveling band of flower children (2 p.m.). It is followed by Rob Zombie's Hooper-inspired ''Devil's Rejects'' of 2005 (6:30 p.m.). In between there's a panel discussion with the critics Nathan Lee, Adam Lowenstein, Maitland McDonagh and Joshua Rothkopf.(Through July 22, Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us; $10.)

2007-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Volker Schlöndorff's new film, ''Strike,'' shares its title with Sergei Eisenstein's 1924 film and also with a rabble-rousing novel from the 1930s by Mary Heaton Vorse about textile workers in North Carolina. More broadly the movie belongs to a tradition of heroic labor-union melodramas that stretches, in America, from ''Waiting for Lefty'' through ''Norma Rae.'' Like ''Norma Rae,'' ''Strike'' tells the story of a tough, resilient working woman who refuses to back down from her fight with the bosses. The difference is that in this case the bosses are not greedy capitalists but Communist bureaucrats, committed, in theory, to defending the interests of the workers. There is a delicious poetic justice in the way Mr. Schlöndorff, in telling part of the story of Poland's Solidarity movement, has used some of the crude, effective techniques of Socialist realism to depict the collapse of socialism. He calls the film ''a ballad inspired by true events,'' and its occasional bouts of clumsiness and sentimentality are inseparable from its power."

2007-06-15T00:00:00Z,"A federal appeals court ruled yesterday that senior federal officials would have to answer questions under oath in a lawsuit accusing them of personally conspiring to violate the rights of Muslim immigrants held in a federal detention center in Brooklyn after 9/11. The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, upholds most of an earlier decision by a federal judge in Brooklyn. The officials, including former Attorney General John Ashcroft and Robert Mueller, the head of the F.B.I., had asked for dismissal of the lawsuit, by Javaid Iqbal, a Pakistani immigrant, arguing in part that the government was entitled to take actions that might not have been lawful before 9/11. Although acknowledging some forms of government action in emergencies may exceed normal constitutional limits, Judge Jon O. Newman rejected the officials' contention, saying some protections against some of the violations claimed, such as needlessly harsh confinement and ethnic discrimination, do not vary with surrounding circumstances. ''The strength of our system of constitutional rights derives from the steadfast protection of those rights in both normal and unusual times,'' he wrote. NINA BERNSTEIN"
2007-06-15T00:00:00Z,"The best dances, like the best stories, tend to feel as if a hidden gate had opened onto an unfamiliar world where you may wander at will. ''The Nightingale and the Rose,'' a strangely magical new work by Christopher Wheeldon that will be performed by the New York City Ballet, opens a door onto several worlds. One is the Oscar Wilde tale of the same title that inspired the ballet, which tells of a nightingale who offers her life for the sake of another's love. There is also the world of the fairy tale itself. And a third is Mr. Wheeldon's abundant and wonderfully unpredictable imagination. He burst onto the scene in 1999 with ''Scènes de Ballet,'' created for students at the School of American Ballet. Tellingly, it celebrated their fresh youth and appetite for space, as well as the pure classical ballet vocabulary they were absorbing. He is as much a purist as George Balanchine, the heart of the company, where Mr. Wheeldon is now in his last year as a resident choreographer before he throws in his lot with a company of his own. ''The Nightingale and the Rose'' also celebrates the prickly attributes of Wendy Whelan (above, with Mr. Wheeldon), who dances the nightingale. Mr. Wheeldon, an admirer of Wilde's, has not produced a comfortably linear version of the story. That might have been difficult, given the composer Bright Sheng's penchant for patches of vivid aural color and heartfelt, sonorous climaxes. Instead evocative images succeed one another much in the way of fairy tales: the nightingale alone in a garden at night; a young man pursuing a silly girl who will never love him; a bird's flight through a dark stage full of whirling yellow and white roses; and gnarled offshoots of a dying rosebush that drink the nightingale's blood to produce the red rose that will later be so carelessly discarded. Deceptively old-fashioned-looking and almost unbearably sad, ''The Nightingale and the Rose'' distills the story and turns it into yet another of Mr. Wheeldon's travels into the terrain that lies beyond the gate to classical ballet.

The money was part of $200 million settlement of a civil suit claiming that about 440 people had been injured by the diet drug fen-phen. The lawyers, William J. Gallion, Shirley A.

2007-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, delivered a critical assessment on Thursday of Gen. Peter Pace's performance as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and demanded that Congress be given a ''fair, honest and frank'' report about conditions in Iraq when it receives a progress report in September. ''General Peter Pace is a distinguished military veteran and public servant,'' Mr. Reid said. ''Unfortunately, in my opinion, he was never as candid as he should have been about the conduct and progress of this war.''"
2007-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Billy Goddard did his job Thursday, which is to say he walked several paces behind his employer and spoke only when spoken to.

2007-06-15T00:00:00Z,"The organizers of Accordionology, which takes place this weekend at Barbès in Park Slope, Brooklyn, describe the event as ''a three-day festival featuring the many facets of the much maligned instrument.'' Much maligned? At first that sounds right. Everyone has encountered portrayals of the suspender-clad squeezebox geek. (Remember Steve Urkel?) Fifteen years ago public perception was dismal enough to provoke the formation of a group called Closet Accordion Players of America, which still exists. But the accordion has had a good run lately, cropping up in Arcade Fire and Bruce Springsteen's Seeger Sessions Band, as well as in many of the robust ensembles -- specializing in Brazilian forró, French musette, Mexican norteño, Balkan klezmer or Argentine tango -- that routinely perform at Barbès. Jazz audiences have warmed to the instrument too, judging by the popularity of the French-Italian virtuoso Richard Galliano, whose album ''Solo'' (Dreyfus) was released this week. As promised, Accordionology -- an aperitif before next week's jazz smorgasbord, the overlapping JVC and Vision festivals -- will present a multifaceted view of its subject. Balkan music will enjoy strong representation by Slavic Soul Party, a club staple, and Ivan Milev, a Bulgarian master. Sounds of Taraab will play the music of Zanzibar, while the 12th Street Playboys will evoke Cajun country. And then there are the visionary eclectics: Guy Klucevsek, who has a brilliant new album, ''Notefalls'' (Winter & Winter), with his fellow accordionist Alan Bern; Will Holshouser, whose most recent release, ''Reed Song'' (Clean Feed), deftly showcases the instrument's versatility; and Ted Reichman (above, far right), who plays a central role in ''For'' (Cuneiform), the fine new release by the Claudia Quintet. (Other Claudia members above are Matt Moran, left, and Drew Gress.) It's a lot of accordion in one place, but probably not as much as you'll hear next month should you attend a master class and concert series in Manhattan sponsored by the American Accordionists' Association (ameraccord.com). That event's moderator, Dr. William Schimmel, describes it as ''a weekend of questionable, useless and farfetched information.'' Who needs a closet after all?

His installations are made from resin, sculptured and painted to look real. But in the past the subject matter has usually leaned toward the fantastic. There was ''Edgar,'' for example, a mythic beast that resembles a long-haired deer with a poodle's haircut, and his 2004 Whitney Biennial contribution, a young snow-white deer scratching its horns on an Oriental carpet."

For the first time, the Green Party will get cabinet posts in an Irish government. The Progressive Democrats, who governed with Fianna Fail for the last 10 years, will have a much reduced role in the new coalition, having lost seats in the national election. EAMON QUINN"

2007-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Banking authorities in the United States and Macao began transferring millions of dollars to North Korea to end a dispute that has stalled an agreement to dismantle the North's nuclear programs, Macao government officials said. The money was transferred from Banco Delta Asia, a small family-owned bank in Macao, in the first step to return the money to the original account holders, the officials said. Under pressure from the United States, the Macao government in September 2005 ordered that about $25 million belonging to either North Korean state agencies or businesses with links to North Korea be frozen in the Macao bank. Diplomats working on putting into effect the agreement reached in February among North Korea, the United States, China, Japan, Russia and South Korea hope the transfer will at last revive stalled attempts to get the North to shut its nuclear facilities.

Delacorte Theater in Central Park, midpark at 80th Street, (212) 539-8750. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' (Tony Award, best revival of a musical 2007) Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' (Tony Award, best musical 2007) Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'CRAZY MARY' Sigourney Weaver and Kristine Nielsen serve their specialties (WASP tartness, madcap madness) with such gusto in A. R. Gurney's comedy that it feels ungallant to point out that their characters are as artificial as hard-plastic dolls. A contrived play that never quite connects its thoughtful mind with its sentimental heart (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'ELECTRA' An ''adaptation'' of Sophocles' play that is more of a spoof of a Greek tragedy than any serious attempt to revive one (1:10). The HAS Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, at 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 868-4444.(Wilborn Hampton) ENSEMBLE STUDIO THEATER MARATHON 2007: SERIES A Neil LaBute's contemporary gloss on a classic tale of Greek vengeance is the highlight of the first round in this annual series of short plays. Dana Delany and Victor Slezak are woman scorned and cad of a hubby in a gruesome drama that packs a visceral punch. Unfortunately, Mr. LaBute's play comes last in a mostly unrewarding program (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'ESCAPE FROM BELLEVUE' This showcase for the band the Knockout Drops is less a theatrical experience than a slightly uncomfortable hybrid of a stand-up routine and a rock concert. It is also the agreeable if predictable memoir of the lead singer, Christopher John Campion, who narrates his own story -- heavy substance abuse, a couple of trips to Bellevue, a brave new life -- with a knack for anecdote and an ear for dialogue, like a particularly good storyteller at the corner bar. But ultimately, a rock musical, even one as understated as this, rises or falls with its music; fortunately, this band, though a little stolid, is pretty good (1:30). The Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, (212) 307-7171. (Anne Midgette) 'FROM RIVERDALE TO RIVERHEAD' Like a spinoff of the ''Saturday Night Live'' skit ''Bronx Beat,'' three strident, shallow sisters dominate this road play by Anastasia Traina, which repeatedly strikes the notes of a comedy skit but steadily increases the volume to an uncomfortable level of cruelty. Louise (Angelica Torn), her sisters and her luminous and quirky daughter, Rosie (Bess Rous), are driving to visit Louise's son in prison, enduring Louise's loud outbursts of self-pity that escalate into hysteria and abuse. The whole play focuses on these four women in the car, evoking the ''Are we there yet?'' of a family trip until it finally, in every sense, veers off the road (2:00). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-4500. (Midgette) 'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists clichéd feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Ginia Bellafante) 'HORIZON' God is in the curriculum in Rinde Eckert's lively portrait of a theologian, an homage to the ''Christian realism'' of Reinhold Niebuhr. But even the fiercest secularist should find pleasure in this engaging performance piece, set in the seminary-without-walls of one man's mind (1:25). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-8996. (Brantley) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'IN A DARK DARK HOUSE' Neil LaBute's latest work, a tale of two badly behaving brothers (played by Frederick Weller and Ron Livingston), is about American adolescence and how it is warped, stolen and willfully extended. Before the double-knotted plot twists take over, it's a cold-eyed, absorbing drama that testifies to its author's very real talents (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'PASSING STRANGE' The composer and performer Stew narrates this semiautobiographical show about a songwriter on a journey of self-discovery. Part rock concert, part book musical, it flows smoothly on a strong current of feeling and humor as the Los Angeles-born central character searches for his musical voice in the hash bars of Amsterdam and the cabarets of Berlin (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) * 'THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL' The Mint Theater Company has unearthed this enthralling Edwardian drama by St. John Hankin about a lazy charmer who returns home to blackmail his wealthy family (2:00). The Mint Theater Company, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Jason Zinoman) * 'THE RULES OF CHARITY' A man with cerebral palsy and the daughter who cares for him are at the center of this scalding play by John Belluso, which hits none of the familiar notes of the works-about-the-disabled genre but many thought-provoking ones. The performances, by the troupe Theater by the Blind, stick with you, along with the unsettling ideas of the play (2:00). Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'the house of bernarda alba' A first-rate revival in an adaptation that is somewhat abbreviated but maintains the play's tragic claustrophobia. A fine cast that includes a 12-member chorus that dances the flamenco (1:40). Nagelberg Theater, Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Hampton) 'TIME FLIES AND OTHERS BY IVES' An amusing collection of comic playlets by David Ives embraces the little guy (1:35). Laurie Beechman Theater, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30).

The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway?

Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'TEA' Age-blind casting is a great strength of the Pan Asian Repertory Theater's production of this play about four Japanese war brides who gather in 1968 to clean up the house of a fifth, who has killed herself. But the play itself crams verbiage and melodrama into what feels like a television epic, complete with that most stereotypical of figures, the dead woman's ghost seeking liberation into the next world. The whole thing goes down like a long soap opera, though the actresses do their best to bring it all to life (1:30). West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Midgette) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AMU' (No rating, 102 minutes, in English, Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi) This ambitious first feature by Shonali Bose, about Kaju, a young Indian-American woman searching for the real India and for her roots, begins as a gentle comedy of cultures clashing. Its true topic, though, is the riots that broke out in Delhi in 1984 after Indira Gandhi's assassination. Thousands of Sikhs were killed, and as Kaju learns, justice has been delayed and denied. (Rachel Saltz) * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'THE BOSS OF IT ALL' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Danish) To describe ''The Boss of It All,'' Lars von Trier's acidic corporate comedy, as '' 'The Office' viewed through the looking glass'' only scratches the surface of the newest film from one of the foremost tricksters of world cinema. (Stephen Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'BROOKLYN RULES' (R, 99 minutes) However authentic and heartfelt this film's depiction of life on the meaner streets of the Northeast corridor may be, its story of three friends growing up in a mob-infested Brooklyn neighborhood doesn't begin to match ''The Sopranos'' in its epic vision of violence, class struggle and upward mobility in a barbarous culture. (Holden) 'BUG' (R, 102 minutes) In this overwrought psychodrama from the director William Friedkin, Ashley Judd's acting continues to surpass her career choices. Playing a shaky Oklahoma barmaid, she convincingly juggles an abusive husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and a newfound lover (Michael Shannon) who sees creepy-crawlies in the mattress and conspiracies everywhere. Though the movie's escalating hysteria may strain credulity, Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'CHALK' (PG-13, 105 minutes) This loose-jointed ensemble mockumentary about high school teachers is funny in a squirm-inducing way. (Holden) 'CRAZY LOVE' (PG-13, 92 minutes) Love is blind, and so too is Linda Pugach, one of the loony-tuners in Dan Klores's somewhat sickening, mildly gonzo documentary. In 1959 Mrs. Pugach, then 22 and known as Linda Riss, was blinded by her husband-to-be Burton Pugach, a Bronx ambulance chaser who single-mindedly pursued the object of his obsession all the way to the marriage altar. (Dargis) 'DAY WATCH' (R, 140 minutes, in Russian) Picking up a number of years after ''Night Watch'' concludes, this second installment in Timur Bekmambetov's bustling supernatural trilogy dazzles and confuses with equal determination. Less coherent than its predecessor, if equally creative, the movie depicts hidden dimensions teeming with beings who swap bodies at will and rewrite destiny with something called the Chalk of Fate. Perhaps the Fickle Finger was otherwise engaged. (Catsoulis) * 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis) 'HOSTEL: PART II' (R, 94 minutes) A trio of American female students are brutalized and butchered by the rich and twisted in Eli Roth's follow-up to his generally odious ''Hostel.'' Both installments are driven by the same low motivation: to push the boundaries of exploitative nastiness. (Laura Kern) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) * 'KNOCKED UP' (R, 129 minutes) Foul of mouth and true of heart, this new comedy from Judd Apatow (''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'') captures the sexual and moral confusion of the present moment remarkably well. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are unlikely bedfellows but perfect comic foils as a shlub-babe couple whose one-night stand leans to an unintended but not unwelcome pregnancy. (Scott) 'MR. BROOKS' (R, 120 minutes) Kevin Costner and William Hurt camp it up as a serial killer and his demonic alter ego in ''Mr. Brooks,'' a werewolf movie masquerading as a sophisticated thriller. (Holden) * 'OCEAN'S THIRTEEN' (PG-13, 113 minutes) The gang's all here, looking fighting trim and Hollywood beautiful, at your disposable pleasure. Steven Soderbergh shoots and directs, while George, Brad and the rest hustle and flow. (Dargis) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) * 'PAPRIKA' (R, 90 minutes, in Japanese) In this gorgeous riot of future-shock ideas and brightly animated imagery, the doors of perception never close. Satoshi Kon's mind-twisting, eye-tickling animé isn't greasy kid's stuff: it's for thinking, interested adults whose sense of wonder remains as alive as their imaginations. (Dargis) * 'PIERREPOINT: THE LAST HANGMAN' (R, 90 minutes) In this meditation on capital punishment and culpability, Timothy Spall, British film's quintessential blundering bloke, sinks his teeth into one of the juiciest roles of his career. His character, Albert Pierrepoint, a once-celebrated English hangman, executed more than 600 people (including 200 Nazi war criminals) from the early 1930s to the mid-1950s. (Holden) 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis) 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'SURF'S UP' (PG, 90 minutes) Treading eagerly on the flippers of last year's ''Happy Feet'' comes this ho-hum, computer-animated comedy featuring birds on boards. As a young Rockhopper penguin (voiced by Shia LaBeouf) heads for his first professional surfing competition, he learns about love, perseverance and that winning isn't everything. Though infused with a friendly, blue-collar vibe, the movie suggests that a moratorium on penguins might be called for -- despite the inevitable anthropomorphic void. (Catsoulis) * 'TEN CANOES' (No rating, 90 minutes, in various Yolngu Aboriginal dialects) There is nothing more enthralling than a good yarn, and the mesmerizing ''Ten Canoes'' interweaves two versions of the same Australian Aboriginal fable, one filmed in black and white and set a thousand years ago and an even older one, filmed in color and set in prehistoric times. (Holden) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) Film Series TO SAVE AND PROJECT: THE FIFTH MoMA INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF FILM PRESERVATION (Today through Monday) This richly varied series of films recently restored by the Museum of Modern Art and other members of the International Federation of Film Archives comes to an end this weekend, but there are still some remarkable things to see: The 1942 film ''A Pilot Returns'' (Friday) is one of the propaganda films made for Mussolini's government by Roberto Rossellini, whose politics changed abruptly (''Open City'') at the war's end; August Blom's ''End of the World'' (Saturday) is an apocalyptic thriller made in Denmark in 1916; ''A Man There Was'' (Saturday) is a 1917 feature by Sweden's first major filmmaker, Victor Sjostrom. Sunday brings a double feature of experimental films by Hollis Frampton, ''Zorns Lemma'' and ''Winter Solstice,'' as preserved by MoMA. The festival ends on Monday with Noel Black's cult favorite ''Pretty Poison''; ''Mata Hari,'' a 1931 George Fitzmaurice film featuring Greta Garbo's sexiest pre-code performance; and Otto Preminger's dark and stately 1947 melodrama, ''Daisy Kenyon,'' with Joan Crawford and Henry Fonda. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) THREE BY JAMES BENNING (Today through Thursday) Nothing seems more ordinary than the notion of a landscape photographer, but a landscape filmmaker is something exceptional -- which is just what James Benning is. His work discovers movement and change where others have for so long seen stasis and permanence. The Anthology Film Archives will be screening three of Mr. Benning's recent films in rotation this week, beginning tonight with ''13 Lakes'' and ''Ten Skies'' (both made in 2004), and adding ''One Way Boogie Woogie/27 Years Later,'' a 2005 revisitation of Mr. Benning's celebrated 1977 film ''One Way Boogie Woogie.'' Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. LILY ALLEN (Sunday) A 22-year-old British singer with deceptively sweet, ska-infused pop songs, Ms. Allen is at her wry and snarky best when putting down disagreeable suitors. ''Smile,'' a No. 1 hit in England, is pure schadenfreude, and ''Knock 'Em Out'' a catalog of snappy answers to bad pickup lines: ''I've got herpes. No, I've got syphilis.'' At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $25. (Ben Sisario) APOSTLE OF HUSTLE, MEMPHIS (Tomorrow and Monday) More evidence that Canada might have more side projects than actual bands: Apostle of Hustle, featuring Andrew Whiteman of Broken Social Scene, plays dreamy washes of guitar over an easygoing rock pulse, recalling the soft points of U2's ''Unforgettable Fire.'' Memphis includes Torquil Campbell of Stars, the superbly urbane indie-cabaret band from Toronto, whose songs are evoked but not equaled by Memphis's delicate melodies and cool dissection of heartbreak. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $10. Monday at 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. (Sisario) * BRAKESBRAKESBRAKES, PELA (Tonight through Sunday) Led by the snarlingly persistent Eamon Hamilton, Brakesbrakesbrakes packs a lifetime of resentment into a taut two-minute power-pop song and turns to wistful country-folk to simmer down. (The band is known simply as Brakes back home in England, but uses the unwieldy triplicate here to distinguish itself from another band named Brakes.) Pela, from Brooklyn, calls its style ''pastoral punk,'' which means wide-open skies of bouncy, Pixiesesque basslines and sharp, sparkling guitars. With Electric Soft Parade. Tonight at 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $14. Tomorrow at 9 p.m. and Sunday at 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario) FAB FAUX (Tuesday and Wednesday) There are Beatles tribute acts, and then there are Beatles tribute acts. This one, featuring the bassist Will Lee (of the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' band) and the guitarist Jimmy Vivino (from ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien''), recreates even the most complex studio work of the later Beatles without breaking a sweat. These two concerts are billed as a full-career Beatles survey: ''From the Cavern to the Rooftop.'' At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) * MICHAEL FEINSTEIN (Tonight and tomorrow night) In the final two performances of ''Celebrating Bobby Short,'' Mr. Feinstein's funny, touching, meticulously researched tribute to this cabaret legend, who died two years ago, his special guests are Barbara Carroll (tonight) and Charles Cochran (tomorrow). This is the jazziest show of Mr. Feinstein's career, and he confidently stands his ground. At 8:30 and 11, Feinstein's at Loews Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover, with a $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden) ALBERT HAMMOND JR. (Monday) The sunshine of ''Yours to Keep'' (Scratchie/New Line), the debut solo album by Mr. Hammond, of the Strokes, shows that crisp guitar classicism need not exist solely in the dark behind Manhattan's velvet ropes. With the Dead Trees and Medium Cool. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sisario) * YUKA HONDA (Tomorrow) The keyboardist half of the fondly remembered 1990s avant-pop duo Cibo Matto -- who sang kitschy and hilarious confections about the infinite bounty of junk food -- Yuka Honda has kept busy as a solo artist and collaborator. Tomorrow, in a show presented by Tonic, she unveils a new project with Petra Haden, whose own ambitions include an a cappella cover of the Who's album ''The Who Sell Out.'' Also on hand: Sean Lennon, Cyro Baptista and DJ Olive. At 8 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, abronsartscenter.org or tonicnyc.com; $15. (Sisario) LYLE LOVETT, K. D. LANG (Thursday) Lyle Lovett uses the ache in his voice to sound utterly heartfelt even when his songs grow wry and absurd, while his limber band covers the Texas spectrum from swing to honky-tonk to gospel. K. D. Lang's big, sultry voice harks back to a bygone era, when pop and country singers knew how to linger over a song's melody. But in the material she writes and chooses, she has a postmodern self-consciousness, embracing lavish emotions without giving in to them entirely. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $45.50 to $101. (Jon Pareles) MASCOTT (Tuesday) If Aimee Mann had fended off cynicism, she might sound like Kendall Meade, the songwriter and singer of Mascott. Ms. Meade's serenely tuneful songs turn folk-rock into stately pop, wrapping vulnerability and longing in quietly radiant arrangements. With Graham Smith, Ghosts I've Met and Twin Thousands. At 8 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. (Pareles) MIDSUMMER NIGHT SWING (Tuesday through Thursday) Lincoln Center's annual outdoor series of low-dipping, high-kicking music and dancing opens on Tuesday with George Gee's Make Believe Ballroom Orchestra and David Berger's Sultans of Swing recreating ''The Count Meets the Duke,'' the 1961 ''duel'' between Count Basie and Duke Ellington. On Wednesday is Charanga Soleil, which mixes salsa with Congolese guitar rumba and Haitian rara drumming; Thursday is a disco party for Gay Pride Week, with Jai Rodriguez as the host. At 7:30 p.m., with dance lessons at 6:30 p.m., Josie Robertson Plaza, Columbus Avenue at 63rd Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $15. (Sisario) * MIKA (Tonight) A 23-year-old British singer driven ''identity mad'' by his pop-culture obsessions -- ''I tried to be Grace Kelly/But all her looks were too sad'' -- Mika aims for the glittery pop bombast of Elton John and Queen, and has the gumption to pull it off. With Sara Bareilles. At 8, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) O'DEATH (Tonight) This raw and ragged New York band draws from the starkness and spiritual purity of Appalachian folk, the menace of punk and the rowdy theatricality of Tom Waits, jumbling sacred and profane. Tonight O'Death celebrates the re-release of its album ''Head Home'' (Ernest Jenning). With the Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band and the Super Monster. At 8, Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $12. (Sisario) * ONEIDA (Tonight and tomorrow night) Things are best in Oneida songs when the patterns of drums, keyboards and guitar converge into powerful, pulsating drones that seem to summon some primordial rock energy. And though this veteran Brooklyn band's latest album, ''Happy New Year'' (Jagjaguwar), also toys with some medieval-ish folk, there is plenty of that eerie, cathartic blare. Tonight at 8, with Dirty Faces, Brass Castle, Repellent and others, at Trash Bar, 256 Grand Street, at Roebling Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn (718) 599-1000, thetrashbar.com; $7. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; free. (Sisario) * PANDA BEAR (Monday) Noah Lennox, better known as Panda Bear, is one of the singers and captains of disorientation in Animal Collective. In that band and on his recent solo album, ''Person Pitch'' (Paw Tracks), he sends the sunniest Beach Boys melodies through endless psychedelic transformations, sometimes elegant and sometimes terrifying. With Rusty Santos and Kria Brekken. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) MACEO PARKER (Sunday) As the alto saxophonist for James Brown in his prime funk years and later for George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic, Mr. Parker has an impeccable pedigree and the skills to match. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35 in advance, $37 at the door. (Sisario) PEACHES (Wednesday) For Peaches, a former Canadian schoolteacher who became the uninhibited queen of electroclash, sex is everything: liberating force, political stage, social equalizer. Rap-singing over sparse, nervy electronic beats, she is a dance-floor dominatrix who demands pleasure, and demands it her way. (''Just one thing I can't compromise/I want to see you work it guy-on-guy.'') ''Guests'' are promised; expect them to end up entangled with their host in one way or another.

(Sisario) MADELEINE PEYROUX, JOSH RITTER (Tomorrow) Like Norah Jones, Ms. Peyroux has become a star by pursuing a gentle and sophisticated, jazz-inflected style -- a jazz-folk halfway point between Billie Holiday and Patsy Cline -- that has no place in the mainstream music business but whose honesty and finesse has struck a chord. Also on the bill is Josh Ritter, a songwriter whose guileless, boy-next-door voice belies the depth and ambition of his songs, whether he is confessing a simple crush or following his thoughts on a long, Whitmanesque incantation. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; $35 to $65. (Sisario) A. R. RAHMAN (Tomorrow) Mr. Rahman became king of the Bollywood soundtrack in the 1990s with a candied, Westernized style that borrows some tricks from Andrew Lloyd Webber. No wonder, then, that Mr. Lloyd Webber looked to him to write the music for ''Bombay Dreams.'' At 8 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $35 to $300. (Sisario) IKE REILLY ASSASSINATION (Tonight) An eloquent wiseguy whose songs evoke Bob Dylan and Paul Westerberg, Mr. Reilly, a former bellhop and gravedigger from Chicago, has the kind of high-energy, hook-heavy folk-rock sound that turns every head in a bar, while his nasal vocals are unsparingly sardonic: ''The friends that you rely on are the train tracks that you lie on.'' With Band of Thieves and the New York Howl. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) BUFFY SAINTE-MARIE (Monday) This 1960s protest folker and longtime champion of American Indian rights will surely sing ''Now That the Buffalo's Gone'' and ''Until It's Time for You to Go,'' and maybe even ''Cod'ine,'' which became a garage-rock standard. But fans will wonder -- and maybe cringe at the thought -- that she will also do her best-known number: ''Up Where We Belong,'' the mawkish 1982 smash sung by Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes, which Ms. Sainte-Marie wrote with Will Jennings and Jack Nitzsche, then her husband. With Krystle Warren. At 7:30 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $30. (Sisario) * TELEVISION, APPLES IN STEREO, DRAGONS OF ZYNTH (Tomorrow) The jam band of the CBGB era, Television proved that bare art-rock need not have any aesthetic limitations, as Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd's guitars wailed in spiky, sinuous counterpoint, and its songs mushroomed into free-form odysseys of melody and noise. Reunited a couple of times since the early '90s, the band doesn't play often enough, but tomorrow it headlines an afternoon at Central Park SummerStage, with Apples in Stereo, a band from Denver that plays power-pop in bright, primary colors; and Dragons of Zynth, which claims to have an ''auto-physio-psychic'' approach to noisemaking. At 3 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free. (Sisario) * RICHARD THOMPSON, OLLABELLE (Thursday) From his days as a guitar prodigy in Fairport Convention, Richard Thompson has set his musings on bitterness and romance to subtly virtuosic, Celtic-infused folk-rock. His new album, ''Sweet Warrior'' (Shout! Factory), dips into nuts-and-bolts '50s rock for a series of stark tableaus of a world in conflict, from spiteful exes to a terrified, death-haunted young soldier in Iraq. The vocal quintet Ollabelle worships blues, country and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes, playing traditional songs like ''John the Revelator'' and originals that connect them to classic roots-rock. At 7 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, brooklynx.org; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario) MARY TIMONY (Tonight) Mary Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces.

(Pareles) TRUE COLORS TOUR (Monday) In the best girls'-night-out package tour to come along in years, Cyndi Lauper appears with Debbie Harry, Erasure and a couple of rowdier underground bands: the heavily mascara'd, cabaret-goth Dresden Dolls, and the Gossip, a trio that plays bare but potent blues-punk. Also on the bill: Rosie O'Donnell and Margaret Cho. At 7 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $51 to $205.50. (Sisario) * VOXTROT (Tonight) Like Morrissey or Ray Davies, Voxtrot's Ramesh Srivastava uses the small scale, tight script and jangly energy of the three-minute rock song -- as well as a fragile voice perfectly comfortable with its limitations -- to focus emotionally compelling character studies. After a steady stream of singles and mini-albums, this Austin, Tex., band finally released its debut LP last month (''Voxtrot,'' on Playlouder/Beggars), a triumph of angst and gush. With Favourite Sons and Au Revoir Simone. At 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20.

(Chinen) ANTHONY COLEMAN TRIO (Tuesday) Anthony Coleman's stylistic world contains everything from the early jazz of his fellow pianist Jelly Roll Morton to the earlier nonjazz of classical and Sephardic folk music.

(Chinen) * KEITH JARRETT, GARY PEACOCK, JACK DEJOHNETTE (Thursday) The standout jazz piano trio of the past 25 years, this ensemble derives much of its identity from the extemporizations of Mr. Jarrett, which can sound crisp and boppish one moment and fluidly romantic the next. But Mr. Peacock, an agile bassist, and Mr. DeJohnette, a deeply musical drummer, also play defining roles. Part of the JVC Jazz Festival. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, $35 to $90.

(Schweitzer) * St. Luke'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) ''Unleashed'' is the final program in the St. Luke's chamber festival celebrating female composers. The women here have dealt with the stigma of being female -- evidently still something of a handicap in a field that remains overwhelmingly male -- by blazing their own trails: their own kinds of music, their own kinds of career.

At 8, Brooklyn Arts Exchange, 421 Fifth Avenue, at Eighth Street, Park Slope, (718) 832-0018, bax.org; $8 to $15.

(Through Oct. 13.) Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays from noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays from noon to 8 p.m., New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, 111 Amsterdam Avenue, at 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-1630, nypl.org.

Tomorrow at 6:30 p.m.; Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, George Carter Road, Becket, Mass., (413) 243-0745, jacobspillow.org; $58. (Dunning) KATHAK ENSEMBLE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Janaki Patrik and her company will present a Kathak dance travelogue that takes the audience from the form's origins in the Indian countryside to the royal courts of a Bollywood movie set. At 8, Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) VALENTINA KOZLOVA'S DANCE CONSERVATORY COMPANY (Tonight) This program includes a new piece by Margo Sappington and excerpts from ''The Pharaoh's Daughter'' and ''Raymonda.'' Many of the performers are Ms. Kozlova's students, though the dancers also include Reyneris Reyes of the Boston Ballet. But to watch these young dancers perform is to see solid, inspired training and the handing down of tradition in three dimensions. At 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $30; $20 for 65+ and children under 12.

(Dunning) JODy OBERFELDER (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Oberfelder, known for her acrobatic, high-energy dance mixed with glints of humor, will present her new ''Heavy Light,'' inspired by Horace Walpole's notion that life is a comedy for thinkers and a tragedy for those who feel, and ''The Title Comes Last,'' in which performers travel from a workaday world into ''a land of vibrancy.'' Take us with you. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 3 p.m., the Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, www.theflea.org; $20; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning) * OUT LIKE THAT! FESTIVAL (Thursday) The festival, which celebrates gay pride in the Bronx, opens with ''She's Got Moves,'' a program of dance by ''fierce, feisty, ferocious'' female choreographers who include Alethea Adsitt, Sharon Estacio and Faye Driscoll.

(Dunning) SENS/NOÉMIE LaFRANCE (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. LaFrance, known for visually dramatic site-specific dance, will present performances of a work in progress called ''Rapture,'' in which dancers travel across stainless-steel roofs and walls in a response to the architectural design of Frank Gehry's Fisher Center. At 8 p.m., Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7900, fishercenter.bard.edu; free. (Dunning) STREB S.L.A.M.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,' through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from mostly yarn-sewn to the popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS:THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at Cézanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'Richard Serra Sculpture: 40 Years,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Michael Kimmelman) MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Sept. 4. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody) Galleries: Uptown 'CONCEPTUAL PHOTOGRAPHY: 1964-1989' There are no surprising names in this intriguing show of one or two works by nearly 30 artists from several generations and countries. But the works themselves are often unusual, especially on the early end, as is the richness with which various subjects and techniques ricochet among them. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through June 23. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea Art & Language, Stephanie Brooks, Helen Mirra, Ian Wilson In a four-artist show that is, to say the least, spare, the Minimal-Conceptual veterans Art & Language and Ian Wilson join forces with the relative newcomers Stephanie Brooks and Helen Mirra. For the most part, Art & Language sets the terms, first with ''Index 003'' (1973), a kind of teaser about the impossibility of saying nothing, which reads in this context as a defense of the work on view. In addition, everyone else here takes lots of language into their art. Peter Blum Chelsea, 529 West 29th Street, (212) 244-6055, peterblumgallery.com, through June 23. (Smith) Kathe Burkhart: 'The Liz Taylor Series: Selections from 1983-2007' The term ''post-feminism'' gains significance when looking at Kathe Burkhart's ''Liz Taylor Series'' paintings. Unlike 1970s feminist artists, Ms. Burkhart doesn't just celebrate famous women; she inhabits one. Ms. Taylor serves as a doppelganger for the artist in paintings that combine movie stills and tabloid images with collaged elements and text. Only a few of the 125 paintings in the series appear here, but they demonstrate how feminism can be retooled for every generation. Alexander Gray Associates, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 399-2636, alexandergray.com, through June 23. (Schwendener) 'In Defense of Ardor' For most of the 2000s, art pundits have campaigned to replace kvetchy postmodernism with a New Sincerity. By why an either/or proposition? Can't irony be ardent? Can't ardor be critically self-aware? Can't passion and reason coexist? In this group show they often do. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, (212) 929-5959, bellwethergallery.com, through June 30. (Holland Cotter) Galleries: Other * MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: 'PREIS bilder' Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) * 'The Museum of Crime and the Museum of God' Put together by the writer Luc Sante from material from his own collection, this assemblage -- with holy cards and vintage mug shots; protective amulets and 1930s crime novels; photographs of murder scenes and of river baptisms -- is essentially about his life and makes a transfixing show. Apexart, 291 Church Street, between Walker and White Streets, TriBeCa, apexart.org, through June 23. (Cotter) 'The Price of Everything: Perspectives on the Art Market' Marcel Duchamp, who tried to redefine art as an active tool for thinking rather than a passive object of looking, hovers like a damaged angel over this think-piece of a group show organized by the 2006-7 Helena Rubenstein Curatorial Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program. The Art Gallery, City University of New York Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, gc.cuny.edu, through June 24. (Cotter) Christian Tomaszewski: 'On Chapels, Caves and Erotic Misery' The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film's ''fourth wall'' by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch's ''Blue Velvet.'' Installed in the SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the ''Blue Velvet'' angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters's ''Merzbau'' to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be over-reaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch's. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, through July 29. (Schwendener) Last Chance * 'Beneath the Underdog' This ultra-cool, downtown-comes-uptown affair is one of the better gallery shows of the year. And full credit goes to its artist-curators, Nate Lowman and Adam McEwen. They've turned Gagosian's six-room space into a mini-museum of objects that speak of the base, the gross, the fallen, the ruined, the failed. A second show, ''Mafia (or One Unopened Packet of Cigarettes),'' is tucked inside. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, between 76th and 77th Streets, gagosian.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) 'CROSSCURRENTS: DURER TO PICASSO' A show of prints and drawings that makes imaginative pairings of older works with those of 20th-century artists who are sometimes cued by their contemporaries as well as their ancestors. The evidence is keen in, for example, Hieronymus Bosch's ''Temptation of St. Anthony'' (1561), a fervidly drawn scene of grotesque beings and fantastic doings placed near two later Surrealist renditions: a biomorphic figment by Andre Masson, ''The Genius of the Species'' (1942), and Salvador Dalí's etching ''Landscape in the Manner of Arcimboldo'' (1934), a biomorphic-geometric vision. A beguiling show. David Tunick, 19 East 66th Street, (212) 570-0090, tunickart.com; closes today. (Grace Glueck) * LOUISE KRUGER: SCULPTURE, 1950s TO THE PRESENT This 21-work survey of mostly carved wood sculpture supplies another chunk in the history of postwar American art. Influenced by folk art and trained for a year by a shipbuilder, Ms. Kruger developed her art sculpture by cutting woodblocks for prints, as an enormous example here attests. Her life-size figures, portrait busts and political asides are in step with other artists of her generation, including Bill King and Marisol.

The militant, Mujahid Asari-Dokubu, was jailed after he declared war against the government over corrupt practices that stripped the Niger Delta of its oil wealth but failed to develop it, making the Niger Delta one of the poorest regions in Africa's top oil producer.

He concluded that officers who raised questions had been punished, that those responsible were not held to account and that an ostensibly independent investigation by Ottawa’s municipal police force, which found no wrongdoing, was effectively guided by the Mounties. He was particularly critical of the “autocratic leadership style” of the Mounties’ former commissioner, Giuliano Zaccardelli.

She added that if the Spice Girls reunite, it would be for only a brief time, as ''a final goodbye and a thank-you to all the fans all over the world.'' More Troubles for Lohan Lindsay Lohan, who recently checked herself into a substance abuse rehabilitation facility, is being sued by a Los Angeles man who alleges that the actress crashed her car into his van almost two years ago while she was under the influence of alcohol. The lawsuit by Raymundo Ortega also names the Ivy, a fashionable Los Angeles restaurant, as a defendant, saying the establishment served Ms. Lohan alcohol even though she was under age. The authorities have said that Ms. Lohan did not appear to be responsible for the crash, in Beverly Hills in October 2005. The Show Rolls On The producers of ''Xanadu,'' the Douglas Carter Beane musical based on the campy 1980 film, have announced a replacement for James Carpinello, who was forced to step aside after suffering a foot injury. Cheyenne Jackson will don the roller skates of Sonny, the leading male role, starting Friday. Mr. Jackson, who wore a pair of blue suede boots as the Elvis-like character in the musical ''All Shook Up,'' had played Sonny in earlier versions of the show. Now in previews at the Helen Hayes Theater, ''Xanadu'' was originally scheduled to open on June 26; a new opening date will be announced early next week. Sony Says 'Sorry' The Sony Corporation apologized yesterday to the Church of England for a computer game that features a bloody shootout inside an Anglican cathedral, The Associated Press reported. The church had demanded withdrawal of Resistance: Fall of Man, which includes a gun battle between a soldier and aliens inside a building that resembles Manchester Cathedral in northwest England. ''It was not our intention to cause offense by using a representation of Manchester Cathedral,'' said the letter to the Very Rev. Rogers Govender, dean of the cathedral. ''If we have done so, we sincerely apologize.'' A Sony spokesman said the letter included the offer of a meeting with church officials, which Dean Govender said the cathedral would accept. But he underlined the church's opposition to ''the gun violence seen in this portrayal of the cathedral.'' The church was particularly concerned because Manchester has a history of gang-related gun violence. In its letter, Sony said it did not accept any connection between the game and social issues in contemporary Manchester. Footnotes The national tour of the musical ''Spring Awakening,'' which won eight Tony Awards this year including best musical, will begin at the Curran Theater in San Francisco in the fall of 2008, Playbill reported Thursday.

The Israeli historian Saul Friedlander will receive the top prize of the annual Frankfurt Book Fair for his narratives documenting the Holocaust, the German Book Trade association said on Thursday. Mr. Friedlander, 74, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, is to be given the $33,000 peace prize during the annual book fair, Europe's largest, in October. Among his best-known works are the two-volume collection ''Nazi Germany and the Jews.'' Previous winners of the award include the Turkish author and Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk and the former Czech president Vaclav Havel."

''People talk about two candidates, possible candidates,'' he said, according to the center, ''but, you know, my president could trade another surprise, and maybe even late during this year you will know about another possible figure.'' His remarks revived speculation in Russia about other political figures close to Mr. Putin who might yet emerge. Mr. Shuvalov emphasized that Mr. Putin intended to step down, saying he did not want Russia to follow other post-Soviet states, like Belarus and Turkmenistan, whose leaders changed their constitutions to retain authoritarian power.

He concluded that officers who raised questions had been punished, that those responsible were not held to account and that an ostensibly independent investigation by Ottawa's municipal police force, which found no wrongdoing, was effectively guided by the Mounties. He was particularly critical of the ''autocratic leadership style'' of the Mounties' former commissioner, Giuliano Zaccardelli.

He suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on Friday in Milan and was hospitalized. Ferre was for many years a leading designer in Milan, beginning his career in the mid 1970s after receiving a degree in architecture. There was always something over-the-top about Ferre's clothes-the white shirt collars always high and sculptural, the leather often laced and assertive, the coats swinging. I once began a review of a Ferre show, in the early 90s, with: ""Diva, can you dig it?"" His clothes had a great sexual energy, if you got your head into them, and I loved that he didn't seem to care a jot about trends and skinny models and so forth. His Dior period was not especially memorable, at least for me, and perhaps that's because he never seemed very happy there (living in the Plaza Athenee), and of course Dior in the early 90s was in transition, not the old style but not quite yet the new era of Galliano and Bernard Arnault."

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"EVERY FRIDAY. By Dan Yaccarino. Henry Holt. $16.95. (Ages 3 to 7) “Friday is my favorite day,” a small boy tells us, because every Friday he and his dad go for breakfast together at the local diner. In cheerful gouache illustrations, they wave to passersby, watch shops open and buildings going up; “everyone is rushing, but we’re taking our time.” A note from the author tells us the book is based on his weekly ritual with his own son. It is also a valentine to good dads and neighborhood diners, and a reminder on Father’s Day that the “little traditions” are sometimes the best ones."

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"MANY states nationwide are considering legislation to legalize the medical use of marijuana. Last week, one such bill cleared both houses in Connecticut (but at press time had not yet been signed by the governor), New York appears likely to follow suit and New Jersey has two bills with bipartisan support. Indeed, a number of states have had similar measures in play over the last year, in addition to the 12 that have already passed such laws. The picture is very different at the federal level, where marijuana is branded as an illegal drug. An amendment to a recent drug safety bill would require all purveyors of state-authorized medical marijuana to be subject to Food and Drug Administration regulation. The senator who introduced this amendment said that making any drug available without F.D.A. review or proof of safety and effectiveness would set a dangerous precedent that would threaten patient safety. Marijuana advocates have opposed the bill, because it would close medical marijuana cooperatives and create barriers to the use of the drug."
2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"CLIGGOTT--Richard T., Sr., founder of Cliggott Publishing Company and a pioneer in the medical publishing world died at his home in Greenwich, CT, June 9th with his wife, Janet at his side. In 1970, Mr. Cliggott led a group of investors in the purchase of ''Consultant Magazine'' from Smith Kline and French to create Cliggott Publishing. From the start, Cliggott Publishing produced original, peer reviewed articles written by physicians for the purpose of advancing medical practice. Cliggott Publishing set the standard for editorial integrity and excellence. Soon after the inception of the company, three other journals were launched, the ''Journal of Respiratory Diseases'', the ''Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine'' and the ''Journal of Critical Illness'', as well as a series of independently sponsored journals. Born in Andover, MA, April 14, 1928, Mr. Cliggott grew up on the Cape in Cotuit, MA. As a young boy during the depression years on Cape Cod, Mr. Cliggott helped support his family by working on farms doing everything from bailing hay to exercising horses. Upon graduation from Barnstable High he joined the Army, serving two years in Korea earning the rank of Master Sergeant. After the army he attended Worcester Academy. Worcester is where he developed his abilities to achieve in both academics and athletics. Mr. Cliggott devoted his life to the school motto, ''Achieve the Honorable'' He became driven to use his intellect, discipline and work ethic to become successful and make his family proud of him. Worcester Academy led Mr. Cliggott to Cornell University on an academic scholarship. For his leadership both in the classroom and on the athletic field he was admitted into the Honorary Quill & Dagger Society. While at Cornell, Mr. Cliggott played varsity baseball and football and in 1953 made Honorable Mention All American in football. During his summer months, Mr. Cliggott was a star player for the Cotuit Kettlers in the Cape Cod summer baseball league. Mr. Cliggott graduated from Cornell in 1953 and worked for the university in their development office. He left Cornell in 1955 and worked for Procter and Gamble where he received his sales and management training. In 1959, Medical Economics of Oradell, NJ hired him and introduced Mr. Cliggott to medical publishing. From 1970-1996 Mr. Cliggott developed Cliggott Publishing into one of America's most admired and respected medical publishing companies. In 1996, Mr. Cliggott sold the company and retired. Mr. Cliggott and his wife of 56 years, Janet, divided their time between their homes in Tequesta, FL and Greenwich, CT. An avid sportsman and outdoorsman, he loved golfing, boating, fishing, hunting and bird watching. Mr. Cliggott was a member of Cornell University's Laboratory Ornithology and the Cornell Plantation. As president of Greenwich Country Club he helped oversee the redesign of the golf course into a competitively challenging course. Mr. Cliggott was a true gentleman and a wonderful story teller with a great sense of humor. He was generous, always taking the time to make those he cared about feel appreciated by him. He was respected and admired by everyone whose lives he touched. Most of all he was devoted to his wife and loved spending time with his children and grandchildren. He is survived by his wife, Janet, his children and their families; Nancy and Bill Hansen and their children Bill, Ricky, and Joe; Dick Jr. and Monica Cliggott and their children Tom and James; Michael and Holly Cliggott and their son Andrew; Patricia and Doug Kent, and Tim Cliggott.

I never thought I would like it, but I love it. It's a wonderful way to travel and see places. This was our first really big trip. We'd never been to California, or to a place in the United States where they had hot springs and that kind of climate, so we were really excited. We also love birding, and on this trip we added more birds to our list than we ever dreamed we would see. We've just had the chance now to experience so many different environments, it's been a real eye-opener.'' As told to Austin Considine"

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"MANY states nationwide are considering legislation to legalize the medical use of marijuana. Last week, one such bill cleared both houses in Connecticut (but at press time had not yet been signed by the governor), New York appears likely to follow suit and New Jersey has two bills with bipartisan support. Indeed, a number of states have had similar measures in play over the last year, in addition to the 12 that have already passed such laws. The picture is very different at the federal level, where marijuana is branded as an illegal drug. An amendment to a recent drug safety bill would require all purveyors of state-authorized medical marijuana to be subject to Food and Drug Administration regulation. The senator who introduced this amendment said that making any drug available without F.D.A. review or proof of safety and effectiveness would set a dangerous precedent that would threaten patient safety. Marijuana advocates have opposed the bill, because it would close medical marijuana cooperatives and create barriers to the use of the drug."

But in the last few weeks, as rates on fixed-interest mortgages have risen, that decision has become more difficult for some borrowers, mortgage industry executives and analysts say. Many borrowers who took out ARMs in 2004 and 2005 with interest rates in the 5 percent range, for example, will soon face their first adjustment, and their rates are quite likely to rise to the high 7 percent range."

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"Milestone Tracker Craig Biggio of the Astros is struggling in his quest for 3,000 hits. He is 11 away, but he hit .250 in April, .231 in May and is hitting .226 this month. Houston will be on the road for nine straight games beginning tomorrow, when it opens a three-game set at the Angels. Like Father, Like Son? Prince Fielder of the Brewers leads the National League in home runs with 24. His father, Cecil Fielder, was the American League leader while with Detroit in 1990 with 51 and tied for the lead with Jose Canseco of the A's in 1991 with 44. Helping Himself Carlos Zambrano of the Cubs hit his second home run of the season last Monday while also picking up his seventh victory. Zambrano has 12 career home runs (in 355 at-bats), second to Mike Hampton of the Braves among active pitchers. Hampton, who has hit 15 (653 at-bats), is on the disabled list and out for the season after elbow surgery. Five K Club Craig Monroe of the Tigers joined Andruw Jones of the Braves as the only other player to strike out five times in a game this season. Monroe did it Thursday against Milwaukee and Jones did it last month against Boston. Another Oakland Ace Dan Haren of the A's leads the American League with a 1.64 earned run average. The last Oakland pitcher to lead the A.L. with an E.R.A. under 2.00 was Vida Blue with a 1.82 in 1971. The A's open a three-game set at home against the Reds tomorrow. The Watch List Pirates shortstop JACK WILSON was on the bench for four consecutive games last week, with some speculating that a lack of hustle on defense had landed him there. After a meeting with team officials, Wilson, right, a former All-Star, played Friday and had hits in his first two at-bats. Although DAVID WEATHERS has performed reasonably well as closer for the Reds, his time in the position may be waning as EDDIE GUARDADO, owner of 183 career saves, is on track to return soon. Having been promoted to Class AAA while recovering from reconstructive elbow surgery, Guardado would solidify the Reds' bullpen and allow Weathers to return to his customary eighth-inning role. All eyes will be on the Brewers' Yovani Gallardo as he is scheduled to make his major league debut tomorrow against the Giants. Considered among the best pitching prospects in baseball, Gallardo struck out 110 batters in 77 2/3 innings for Class AAA Nashville. His call-up may be short, however, because the injured Chris Capuano is not expected to take more than 15 days to recover from a strained groin muscle."

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"This is the time of year that music grows feet. From fall to spring the Metropolitan Opera sits at Lincoln Center and waits for its audience to come to it. This week, it is coming to a park near you. THE METROPOLITAN OPERA IN THE PARKS season will bring along a repertory that is beloved with a capital B, and the admission is free. A mobile stage and lots of loudspeakers do not make for a pristine listening experience, and the shows may be something like picnics and conversation, with opera as a kind of Muzak in the background. Also, don't look for much in the way of staging, costumes and production values. The rewards, on the other hand, are many. The most valuable is the crowd itself: a wondrous mix of the operatically inclined, the plain curious and people who just want a night under the stars and don't mind if music goes along with it. On Tuesday Gounod's ''Faust'' is performed at Prospect Park in Brooklyn. On Wednesday the Met makes its way to Cunningham Park in Queens, with ''La Bohème'' by Puccini on the program. On Friday it's ''Faust'' again at Brookdale Park in Bloomfield and Montclair, N.J. On Saturday the Met stays in New Jersey for a repeat of ''La Bohème,'' this time at Buccleuch Park in New Brunswick. The Met's parks series often uses the opportunity to try out singers who are either new to or not established in this country. Discoveries and surprises (good or bad) are part of the fun.

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"One of the reasons we need THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL, the traveling series of mostly documentary films that arrives in New York City on Friday, is the chance to see a film like ''Hot House,'' Shimon Dotan's study of Palestinan prisoners in Israel's highest-security jails. A detailed examination of prison life, ''Hot House,'' which has its New York premiere on June 25, includes interviews with many prisoners involved in suicide bombings. Most express no remorse for their deadly actions and reject the term ''terrorists'' in favor of ''freedom fighters.'' This politically even-handed film, which won a special jury prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival, suggests that the system which houses some 10,000 ''security prisoners,'' some of them for life, only fortifies the zeal of the terrorists who regard prison as an educational institution for the sharing of ideas and the development of strategy. It concludes that prison is an efficient incubator for future radical Palestinian leaders. The festival, at the Walter Reade Theater, opens with ''Mon Colonel,'' a film directed by Costa-Gravas and Jean-Claude Grumberg that offers another look back at the French-Algerian war. It closes next week with ''The Devil Came on Horseback,'' the portrait by Annie Sundberg and Ricki Stern of Brian Steidle, a former Marine Corps captain whose photographs of the Darfur killing fields awakened the world to mass slaughter that continues. Another outstanding selection is Alejandro Landes's ''Cocalero,'' which follows the rise of President Evo Morales of Bolivia, a grass-roots politician backed by impoverished coca farmers threatened by the American war on drugs. ''The Unforeseen,'' by Laura Dunn, investigates the battle between real-estate developers in Austin, Tex., and environmental activists. The uncomfortable truth revealed by these films is that there are no easy solutions to the world's ills; that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction that may be delayed but is eventually felt.

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"The big openings of the international shows in Europe end this weekend, which means that in the United States all is still quiet on both the Eastern and Western museum fronts. But the middle of the country is delivering in three exhibitions that become more unusual as you move from South to North. THE KIMBELL ART MUSEUM in Fort Worth is playing it relatively safe with ''The Mirror and the Mask: Portraiture in the Age of Picasso, opening Sunday. What it lacks in daring it should make up for in important works by heavy hitters and, one assumes, interesting juxtapositions. The artists start with Picasso and Matisse and include Miró, Beckmann, Bacon and Dubuffet. Meanwhile, another city, another era. On Sunday the ST. LOUIS ART MUSEUM unveils ''Symbols of Power: Napoleon and the Art of the Empire Style, 1800-1815,'' a show of 140 decorative objects that will examine the way Napoleon and his designers countered the frivolities of the last royal style (Rococo) with a Neo-Classical revival. Simplicity was increasingly augmented with emblems of authority borrowed from Greek, Rome and of course Egypt, where Napoleon had his first foretaste of Waterloo, in the military sense, but triumphed archeologically. The exhibition has been organized with the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris; many of its works have never been exhibited outside France. On Saturday THE MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART in Chicago will take a highly focused look at some of the contemporary art coming out of Mexico. ''Escultura Social: A New Generation of Art from Mexico City'' takes its title from ''social sculpture,'' Joseph Beuys's encapsulation of his ambition to work in three dimensions -- with objects, video, installation and performance -- in ways that transform society. For nearly 20 years the artists in and around Mexico City have followed his cue with unusual alacrity. Including 18 artists, a collective, an architect and way too few women, this show will take a look at the efforts of the newest recruits."

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"TWEAKING TWINKIES The News -- Hostess, maker of Twinkies, Ding Dongs and other snacks, has begun offering Twinkies filled with banana crème. Behind the News I-- ntroduced in 1930, the sponge snack cake has become part of the national panorama, with more than 500 million sold a year. In 2000, it was included with the Bill of Rights and other items in the National Millennium Time Capsule ''to represent America.'' . Banana crème was used until a banana shortage in the 1940s forced a switch to vanilla filling. Hostess decided to bring it back after banana-crème Twinkies flew off shelves in a limited-time offer. LOW ON SYRUP The News -- Maple syrup production dropped 13 percent this year to 1.26 million gallons. Behind the News -- Maine was down 25 percent; Vermont, producer of more than one-third of the nation's syrup, was off by 2 percent. Uncooperative weather hurt the sap flow, with New England too cold and other areas too warm. Making matters worse, the sap's sugar content, averaging about 2.5 percent, was lower than usual, requiring more sap to make a gallon of syrup -- about 45 gallons, on average, or 5 gallons more than usual. CEREAL CRACKDOWN The News -- The Kellogg Company said it would phase out advertisements to children under 12 unless its products meet specific nutritional criteria. Behind the News -- Fruit Loops, beware. The world's largest cereal maker said it would reformulate its foods to reduce calories, sugar, fat and sodium or stop marketing them to children by the end of 2008. About half of the products Kellogg markets to children worldwide exceed the standards. As a result of the new policy, two advocacy groups have agreed not to sue Kellogg over its advertising to children. SUGAR ANXIETY The News -- The consumption of foods that are low in sugar or sugar free is rising as more consumers worry about sugar levels, a market study found. Behind the News -- The study by the NPD Group, a market research firm, found that 44 percent of consumers are extremely or very concerned about sugar in their food, the highest level since 1994. Consumers are cutting back as a result. Twenty percent ate low-sugar, sugar-free or artificially sweetened food at least once in a two-week period last year, compared with 14 percent in 2001, according to the study. TOUGH TALK The News -- A panel of medical experts said children at risk of becoming obese should eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages from their diets. Behind the News -- The recommendation was one of many by an American Medical Association committee on childhood obesity. The panel defined children at risk as having a body-mass index equal or above the 85th percentile but below the 95th, at which a child is obese. Doctors were urged to be frank with patients. ''We need to describe this in medical terms, which is obesity,'' one panel member said."

The home sits on 4.7 acres near the Tennessee governor's mansion. Mr. Oreck's purchase rekindled speculation that the company might move its headquarters from New Orleans to Tennessee, where it relocated some of its operations after Hurricane Katrina."

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"A message to those who have applied for -- and are eagerly awaiting -- passports: relax. The Departments of State and Homeland Security announced on June 8 that through Sept. 30, United States citizens traveling to Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda may enter and depart the United States by air as long as they have a government-issued photo identification and proof that they have applied for a passport. The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, which has required passports for all air travel outside of United States territories since Jan. 23, has created a record demand for passports, meaning longer processing and turnaround times. Details are at www.travel.state.gov. Want more ''Pirates of the Caribbean''? Hotels on Dominica, which provided some locations for the movies starring Johnny Depp (below), have created packages for pirate-crazy travelers. A seven-night experience offered by Calibishie Lodges (www.calibishie-lodges.com) includes visits to eight spots used in the movies; it is available for $599 a person, double occupancy, if reserved by June 30. A seven-day package offered by the Tamarind Tree Hotel and Restaurant (www.tamarindtreedominica.com) includes tours led by the driver for Gore Verbinski, the movie's director, starting at $1,615 a person, double, with all meals.

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"IT'S not a lot. ''It doesn't take much time,'' says Ignatius Muscarella. It's not hard to do. Still, every Tuesday for many years now, Mr. Muscarella has given up his lunch hour to deliver surplus food to a soup kitchen. He is a 50-year-old lawyer who clerks for a State Supreme Court judge. Dressed in his work clothes -- starched white shirt, tie, suspenders, dark suit -- he rushes out of the courthouse here at 12:45, hops into his Hyundai Sonata, then drives to the back entrance of nearby Winthrop Hospital. He pulls a large cooler out of his trunk and hurries into the hospital kitchen, where Annette Cambria, the sous-chef, leads him into a walk-in freezer."
2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"MANY states nationwide are considering legislation to legalize the medical use of marijuana. Last week, one such bill cleared both houses in Connecticut (but at press time had not yet been signed by the governor), New York appears likely to follow suit and New Jersey has two bills with bipartisan support. Indeed, a number of states have had similar measures in play over the last year, in addition to the 12 that have already passed such laws. The picture is very different at the federal level, where marijuana is branded as an illegal drug. An amendment to a recent drug safety bill would require all purveyors of state-authorized medical marijuana to be subject to Food and Drug Administration regulation. The senator who introduced this amendment said that making any drug available without F.D.A. review or proof of safety and effectiveness would set a dangerous precedent that would threaten patient safety. Marijuana advocates have opposed the bill, because it would close medical marijuana cooperatives and create barriers to the use of the drug."
2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"Albany is now at the final four -- the final four days, that is, before this year's legislative session is scheduled to end. A lot can be done, undone or done badly in that time. Here is our list of what should be possible: No. 1 is still campaign finance reform. The bill now being considered is less than the good citizens of this state deserve, but it is far better than what we have now. Unfortunately, Senate Leader Joseph Bruno and his Republican majority are stalling. The Senate Republicans apparently don't want to give up the easy money, especially from limited liability corporations that are now the favored loophole for well-heeled contributors."

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Liz Harris Behling's point about the dangers of reviewing translations (Letters, May 20) is well taken. There is an inevitable dilettantism inherent in reviewing a translation of a language one may know poorly or not at all (and even one's reading knowledge of that language is likely to be far inferior to the translator's expertise). And the constraints of space rarely allow one to give proper credit to the translator. The translator certainly loses, and does not deserve to."

But as she acknowledged, there was no language in the Senate resolution requiring the president to try to work with the U.N. And as an experienced lawyer, she should have known that if you don't have the language, you don't have the deal. Her vote is all the more inexplicable, given her prior vote against a substitute resolution, offered by Carl Levin, requiring precisely the diplomatic requirement she had advocated."

We spent the year of my husband's sabbatical (1998-99) in Turku, Finland, where our 6-year-old daughter, who would have entered first grade here, was eligible only for a half-day kindergarten program. At first I was upset, but it proved to be a fabulous year for her, with almost no academic expectations but with a rich curriculum for creative growth as well as vigorous outdoor exercise every day. The teachers I spoke to thought it was actually damaging to children to teach reading and math before age 7 and that the early years were the appropriate time to stress the social and emotional growth also necessary for later school success."

Still, every Tuesday for many years now, Mr. Muscarella has given up his lunch hour to deliver surplus food to a soup kitchen. He is a 50-year-old lawyer who clerks for a State Supreme Court judge. Dressed in his work clothes -- starched white shirt, tie, suspenders, dark suit -- he rushes out of the courthouse here at 12:45, hops into his Hyundai Sonata, then drives to the back entrance of nearby Winthrop Hospital. He pulls a large cooler out of his trunk and hurries into the hospital kitchen, where Annette Cambria, the sous-chef, leads him into a walk-in freezer."

A lot can be done, undone or done badly in that time. Here is our list of what should be possible: No. 1 is still campaign finance reform. The bill now being considered is less than the good citizens of this state deserve, but it is far better than what we have now. Unfortunately, Senate Leader Joseph Bruno and his Republican majority are stalling. The Senate Republicans apparently don't want to give up the easy money, especially from limited liability corporations that are now the favored loophole for well-heeled contributors."

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"Americans have to be outraged that any senator would vote to send the nation to war without reading the most relevant document: the 90-page 2002 National Intelligence Estimate. This report, available to all 100 senators, contained enough information to cause Bob Graham to doubt the threat to the United States posed by Iraq. He was one of only six senators to read the report. Clinton was not among those six; she opted for ''briefings'' instead. She voted, as did many others, for a disastrous foreign policy blunder based on the CliffsNotes version of a national intelligence report. Not very smart for one of the ''brainiest'' people in the Senate."

No character assassination, no political muckraking, no hidden agenda, just documented and verifiable statements regarding Senator Clinton and specifically her Senate voting record concerning United States military operations in Iraq. In this matter, the record clearly indicates that she did not ask herself the pertinent question about the best interests of this country, only what was best -- or the least damaging -- for her political ambitions. An even more pertinent question is how this mind-set would influence her decisions as president, a question voters should seriously consider, given that she may be the Democratic presidential candidate in 2008."

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"In March fans eagerly awaiting the new ANIMAL COLLECTIVE album (''Strawberry Jam,'' due in September) got something else instead: ''Person Pitch'' (Paw Tracks), a spectacular solo CD from PANDA BEAR, one of the Animals. It might be the sweetest album yet to emerge from Animal Collective's gently discombobulated universe, a sunny collection of fractured ballads and exuberant splintered jam sessions. (Animal Collective fans, be honest: If someone had told you this was the band's new album, would you have known the difference?) This week Panda Bear embarks on an abbreviated United States tour. On Monday he is scheduled to play at the Bowery Ballroom; then, after shows in Philadelphia and his native Baltimore, he returns to the Bowery Ballroom on Saturday for the last of the four solo shows. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. Also on Monday night: the New York stop on the TRUE COLORS TOUR, organized to combat discrimination and to ''raise public awareness about the issues facing the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.'' The lineup is an appealing mishmash: the American pop veterans Cyndi Lauper and Debbie Harry alongside the British pop veterans in Erasure; the spiky cabaret-punk duo the Dresden Dolls; the M.C. tag team of Margaret Cho and Rosie O'Donnell; and, maybe best of all, the dance-punk trio the Gossip, led by the bluesy yawper Beth Ditto. Though she's from Arkansas, she has become a rock star in Britain; expect her to act like one. Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171; $51 to $205.50."
2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''Hotel Check-In Policies; Early Arrivals and Late Departures Get Harder'' (Practical Traveler, May 27) by Michelle Higgins exposed a challenge facing hotels today that invest in advertising to win back guest loyalty but not in the tools and processes needed to meet the expectations raised by the advertising. Most hotel housekeepers punch a code on the guestroom telephone, which instantly makes the room show as ready in the hotel computer. Unfortunately, automation inspires cost-cutting, which reduces the number of supervisors patrolling the floors. Every morning, most hotels assign someone to knock on doors and inquire when guests plan to vacate, or to look for personal effects in empty rooms that signify a guest is planning to remain in the room until or past checkout time."

By the time Mrs. Pincus, 46, of White Plains, had stopped, her friend was lying in the road. Her helmet had flown off, and her head had hit the pavement so hard that blood soon began to ooze from both ears."
2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"Lisa Curran's figure-flattering classic tank bathing suit has earned a following among women who dread shopping for a swimsuit. This year, Ms. Curran is endearing herself to this set with three new variations on the theme. Her shirred one-piece, which has a deep V-neck and exaggerated shirring down the front to hide imperfections ($150), hit stores this season and 5,000 suits quickly flew out the doors; the company re-cut the suit in new colors to meet demand. Her Retro one-piece (far right, $150) and Twisted Two-Tone (right, a 70s-inspired take on the classic tank, $148, all at Lisacurran.com) also sold out in a week and are being reshipped to stores.

George and Laura Bush seem to be an admirably well-suited and loving couple, the very model of a first family (minus a few untoward events involving the kids). They're a throwback couple, like Rob and Laura Petrie from ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' -- one amiable and slightly buffoonish, the other tolerant and wryly exasperated. The fictional Laura (played by Mary Tyler Moore) was a lot goofier than the real one; but each knew her place, which was in the home, by the side of her man."

AMERICAN BALLET THEATER may be especially exciting this week because it is entirely devoted to Kenneth MacMillan's version of ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Many of the company's stars will take their turns as the tragically star-crossed lovers. Among the performances of note: the American ballerina GILLIAN MURPHY makes her New York debut as Juliet, DAVID HALLBERG as her Romeo on Wednesday, and the Italian dancer ALESSANDRA FERRI gives her final performance with the company on Saturday night, with ROBERTO BOLLE, a guest artist also from Italy. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m., Wednesday and Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, abt.org, $24 to $110. Portraying Romeo and Juliet is probably a common dream for the young dancers participating in this year's NEW YORK INTERNATIONAL BALLET COMPETITION. The hopefuls, who represent 17 countries, will present pas de deux in the first of four public performances on Wednesday night. The rounds continue through Saturday, and an international jury will hand out awards at a gala next Sunday. Wednesday through Saturday at 8 p.m., June 24 at 7 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, nyibc.org; $29, $19 students and 65+ on Wednesday through Saturday, $71.50 for the gala.

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"Tiger Woods is not the only golfer on the leader board who will be stalking his third United States Open title Sunday. Lee Janzen, the champion in 1993 and 1998, was seven strokes back Saturday after his third consecutive three-over-par 73. He may have a lot of ground to make up, but it would be unwise to count out Janzen, who came back from five strokes down in the final round of his '98 victory. He steps onto the tight Open courses the way Clark Kent steps into a telephone booth: He seems to gain supernatural powers of concentration and the confidence that he can conquer even the most diabolical conditions."

(June 14) attributes poor viewership of the N.B.A. finals to such elements as the small-market teams involved and NBA.com. One reason not considered is the N.B.A.'s inability to enforce rules with common sense. In the 1997 playoffs, Miami's P. J. Brown threw the Knicks' Charlie Ward over his shoulder.

''Conspiracy theorists'' -- blithe generalization -- should according to Burroughs be ''ridiculed, even shunned ... marginalized the way we've marginalized smokers.'' Let's see now. The following people to one degree or another suspected that President Kennedy was killed as the result of a conspiracy, and said so either publicly or privately: Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon; Attorney General Robert Kennedy; John Kennedy's widow, Jackie; his special adviser dealing with Cuba at the United Nations, William Attwood; F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover (!); Senators Richard Russell (a Warren Commission member), and Richard Schweiker and Gary Hart (both of the Senate Intelligence Committee); seven of the eight congressmen on the House Assassinations Committee and its chief counsel, G. Robert Blakey; the Kennedy associates Joe Dolan, Fred Dutton, Richard Goodwin, Pete Hamill, Frank Mankiewicz, Larry O'Brien, Kenneth O'Donnell and Walter Sheridan; the Secret Service agent Roy Kellerman, who rode with the president in the limousine; the presidential physician, Dr. George Burkley; Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago; Frank Sinatra; and the ''60 Minutes'' producer Don Hewitt.

As a high school senior who reads stacks of books for pleasure each summer, I have detested every summer reading list since fourth grade. Summer reading traditionally starts as politically correct angst and then evolves into increasingly opaque volumes of classics. Every year, the agony of struggling through this mass ultimately comes down to a single summer reading quiz in September. I empathize with any student who has to endure his or her English teacher's recitation of this article and subsequent declaration that, once and for all, it's all really for our own good and if The New York Times says so, then the system can't really be twisted and sadistic. The horror! The horror!"

Last month, he won his case. Judge Gail Rice of City Court dismissed the indictment, as well as a charge for possession of drugs, which the police would not have found on Mr. Hoffstead if he hadn't been detained for panhandling."

Instead, the chief operating officer of the Starwood Capital Group plotted -- with the help of Homebase Abroad, a luxury villa company that specializes in Italy -- to arrange a week in Tuscany last year as a surprise for his wife, Cathy, to be shared with more than two dozen friends and family members. ''I thought we were going to the Amalfi Coast on our own,'' said Mrs. Dishner. ''My husband told me we had to stop by the Tuscan home of a business associate for cocktails. We drove up this long driveway to this truly stunning villa. Then we were led around a corner to a pool and terrace filled with 28 of our closest friends all holding glasses of champagne.

These include hundreds of independent book retailers (statistically weighted to represent all such outlets); national, regional and local chains; online and multimedia entertainment retailers; university, gift, supermarket, discount, department stores and newsstands. An asterisk (*) indicates that a book's sales are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A dagger () indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders. Expanded rankings are available on the Web: nytimes.com/books. All four children's lists appear each week on the Book Review's Web site. Publishers have provided the age designations for their best-selling children's titles."

Her loving and beloved children, Laurie Gilkes and Peter Davis, her adored and adoring grandchildren Amy Gilkes Loe and Conner Davis, and her dear grandson-in-law Brad Loe miss her already. Fabulously feisty, she was surrounded by people who loved and respected her. She lived by her father's oft-quoted words, ''Let nothing disturb the harmony of your thoughts''. A memorial service is being planned. The family will be receiving guests at Dee's home on Sunday and Monday. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Visiting Nurse Service of NY Hospice Care and to Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center."
2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"HBO does not want you to stop believing in HBO just because ''The Sopranos'' is no longer with us. The network is ensuring that we remain fed. Among its new series is a comedy called ''FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS,'' making its debut on Sunday at 10:30 p.m. It delivers the exploits of a two-man band from New Zealand that seeks its fortune in New York under the guidance of a manager who moonlights -- or, rather, daylights -- at the country's consulate in Manhattan. Approach with caution if sideburns constitute a look you cannot abide. ''MEADOWLANDS,'' a new series on Showtime also beginning on Sunday (at 10 p.m.) is not actually about the Meadowlands, which is to say it is not here to satisfy our New Jersey fetish. Like ''The Riches'' on FX, this show is about obscured identities, a family in hiding, criminal pasts, the secrets suburban developments harbor. If Jimmy Hoffa's body turns up by the final episode, disregard all of what's been said. The show will have been about the New Jersey Meadowlands after all. New seasons of ''THE 4400'' and ''THE DEAD ZONE,'' both on the USA network, also begin on Sunday, and Monday brings the debut of ''HEARTLAND'' (TNT, 10 p.m.), a new medical drama starring Treat Williams in which nothing as mundane as a knee replacement bogs the doctors down. Here, Mr. Williams plays an organ-transplant surgeon who must deal with the miseries of replacing failing kidneys -- and with a co-worker who happens to be his ex-wife."

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"The article only confirmed my conviction that Hillary Clinton's positions vacillate according to the polls of public opinion, making it impossible to discern how she truly feels about issues important to me, a liberal Democrat. Her approach, while arguably identical to that of the other candidates, is no more palatable to me than its polar opposite -- George Bush's ''stay the course'' refusal to listen to the electorate."
2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"Gay Pride Week starts Sunday and ends with next Sunday's annual parade, making it easy to spend the entire week taking in gay-theme theater. On Sunday THE NEW YORK NEO-FUTURISTS are presenting the final show in a weekend-long run of ''Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind: Super Gay!'' This hyperkinetic troupe's M.O. is a race against the clock to present 30 very short plays --all written by company members, in 60 minutes. Audience members choose the order of the lineup by yelling out choices from a list they've been handed at the door. Standard rules apply this weekend, but the subject matter across the board will be, well, super gay. Sunday at 8 p.m., Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $20. Ever type your name into the search box in Google just to see what comes up? Citations for people who share your name. Jason Schafer, who wrote for ''Queer as Folk, uses ''ego surfing'' as a jumping-off point for his new play, ''I GOOGLE MYSELF.'' In it, a gay pornographic star, a stoner-mechanic-poet and a stalker share a common name in this production by Theater Askew that poses the question: How far might one go to be a top search term on Google? In previews, opens on Thursday, Under St. Marks, 94 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $18.

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''Cocaine, Hidden in Plain Sight'' by Melena Ryzik (June 10): The writer, as well as the clinical experts and club denizens she quotes, all miss a glaring truth about cocaine abuse. The legal system turns a blind eye to casual cocaine use because the users are part of an upscale, largely white, largely young population of social climbers. Crack users are perceived to be a largely poor, largely minority population with no social mobility."

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"FOR two former undercover detectives in their early 40s who cheated death time and again, no day is ordinary, not anymore, and certainly not a day like this one on the shore of Long Island -- a day showered with sea spray and salt air; with clam bellies in a bucket at their sides and jigs tempting stripers in the surf; with sand and sky, wind and waves, straight talk about life and mocking chatter about death. As they keep a watchful eye for any wiggle of their 15-foot-long fishing poles, Ernest Vallebuona of New City, N.Y., and Michael Valentin of Ronkonkoma, N.Y., shoot the breeze about how, as partners in one of New York City's undercover vice squads, they easily adapted to the pace of street work -- long hours of waiting interrupted by spurts of dramatic action -- kind of like saltwater fishing, actually."
2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"KALTMAN--Martin, died on June 15th at the age of 92. He had homes in Old Westbury, NY and Key Biscayne, FL. He was a man of great vision, imagination and a pioneer of the modern Lithographic industry in New York. With fellow Brooklyn Tech graduate Max Verebay they started Kaltman Press in 1932 to print labels by the letterpress process. They remained partners for 66 years. When the LP record was invented in 1947, they started printing album covers. With the advent of lithography they joined with Jack Hecht in 1950 to create Queens Lithographing Corp. in Long Island City. With the growth of album sales in the sixties. Queens Litho printed all Beatles and Rolling Stones LPs and the company grew rapidly. During that period the company opened factories in Edison, NJ and Indianapolis. In 1964 the company displayed an operating printing press on the floor of Grand Central Station. The volume of music packaging exploded in the eighties with the introduction of the compact-disc and the company added a factory in Louisville to handle the growth. The company changed its name to Queens Group Inc. Packaging for Home Video, Video games and Software created the need for added capacity and the company built two factories in North Carolina. The company also produced high quality packaging for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and private label. The company was sold in 1998 and is now part of International Paper. A philanthropist, Mr. Kaltman actively supported UJA-Federation, MOMA, Julliard School where he endowed a scholarship, NSUH-LIJ Health System and the Botanical Gardens in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. Martin was a founder of American Friends of Boystown Jerusalem and his company donated a printing press to the school in Israel. He loved growing plants, flowers, trees, vegetables and studied Horticulture at SUNY Farmingdale, and helped establish The Gardens at Crandon Park in Key Biscayne. He was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather and uncle. Mr. Kaltman's first wife, the former Helen Reich, died in 1984. He is survived by his second wife, the former Rosalie Podoll, her children and grandchildren. His son Eric and wife Marnee of Old Westbury, NY, their children Dennis, Richard, Jodi, Jon, their spouses and eight greatgrandchildren. His daughter Gail Bates and husband Dennis of Marietta, GA, their children Stephanie, Robin, their spouses and four greatgrandchildren.

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"Beach cover-ups achieve a luxurious level, thanks to a line of summer dresses, tunics and pants by Taka. The bright, lavishly patterned clothes are made in super-fine woven cottons, so lightweight they can be worn as cover-ups over swimsuits, but opaque enough to be worn as street clothing. Look for beautiful hand-beaded detailing, braided camisole straps, microfringed hems and pants with elastic waists for yoga lovers or poolside lounging ($114 to $289 at Gatsbys in Great Barrington, Mass.; 413-528-9455).

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"I found it interesting that gender was not discussed. School and academics, in the early years especially, are geared more to the activity level of girls. Generally speaking, girls are capable of sitting quietly longer and are more interested in reading and paperwork than boys of the same age. (Of course, there are exceptions.) But carrying this forward to the middle-school years, it is so obvious that girls mature earlier, both physically and socially. I think we'd be doing society a favor by instituting a gender option of starting boys in kindergarten a year later than girls. In reality, with ''redshirting,'' that's what's happening. It's mostly boys who are given an additional year to mature."

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"MANY states nationwide are considering legislation to legalize the medical use of marijuana. Last week, one such bill cleared both houses in Connecticut (but at press time had not yet been signed by the governor), New York appears likely to follow suit and New Jersey has two bills with bipartisan support. Indeed, a number of states have had similar measures in play over the last year, in addition to the 12 that have already passed such laws. The picture is very different at the federal level, where marijuana is branded as an illegal drug. An amendment to a recent drug safety bill would require all purveyors of state-authorized medical marijuana to be subject to Food and Drug Administration regulation. The senator who introduced this amendment said that making any drug available without F.D.A. review or proof of safety and effectiveness would set a dangerous precedent that would threaten patient safety. Marijuana advocates have opposed the bill, because it would close medical marijuana cooperatives and create barriers to the use of the drug."

2007-06-17T00:00:00Z,"METZ--Eugene L., 90, a lifelong educator, died in Augusta, Georgia on May 30, 2007. Born in New York City in 1917, son of Herman A. Metz and Alice van Ronk Metz, he attended The Choate School (class of 1936) and Yale University (class of 1941). Due to a childhood bout with Polio, he was unable to join the WWII efforts. In 1942, he became headmaster at the Graham Eckes School in Palm Beach, Florida. After the war, he moved to Boston, Massachusetts and taught English at the Thayer Academy. On a trip to South America he met his future wife, Gloria Eastman in Quito, Ecuador. In 1952, the Metz family moved to Strasbourg, France, where Mr. Metz became a student advisor at the College of Free Europe. Later, in Paris, he became one of the directors of the Free Europe Committee, an institution whose purpose was to promote the ideas of western democracy to students from behind the Iron Curtain and Africa. In 1966, the family moved back to Quito, Ecuador where Mr. Metz worked on restoring his wife's family 400-year-old ''Hacienda Cusin,'' now a wellknown hotel near Otavalo. After his wife's death, he became Director General of the Colegio Americano de Quito, until 1979 when he returned to the United States, first to Boston and then to West Palm Beach. Except for a brief return to Quito as interim Director of the Colegio Americano from 1988 to 1991, he resided in West Palm Beach until early 2007. Mr. Metz was a cultivated man and engaging raconteur. His fair-minded attitude and sense of humor endeared him to his many friends and students. He will be remembered fondly by everyone who knew him. He is survived by his children, Victoria, Philip and Daniela, Edward and Eugenia and grandchildren Nicholas, Caroline, Isabella and Alexandra as well as many other family members in the USA, Ecuador and Europe."

On my last trip to Moscow I was assaulted by a group of neo-Nazi skinheads. I was kicked, punched and spit upon by this group of six delinquents.

As the mother of a first grader who is a year younger than many of his classmates, I have struggled with issues of readiness, maturity and size. However, as a high-school teacher, I have had experience with the consequences of the decision to begin kids later. Increasingly, 12th-grade classrooms are filled with students at the tail end of their teenage years. I'm curious why articles that address this issue rarely look at it from the perspective of high-school students. At some point, do the benefits that accrue from delayed entry to kindergarten turn into deficits, as students find themselves graduating from high school at 19 and college at 23?"

''We will never achieve anything close to universal access to health insurance unless we save the costs that can be saved in health care by reducing all the redundant studies that we do and reduce the costs of performing transactions in health care,'' said Dr. Herb Conaway, a Democratic assemblyman from Burlington who was one of the primary sponsors of the bill.

McKeown, who was leading the contest."
2007-06-19T00:00:00Z,"An article in The Magazine on Sunday about Dr. Ronald McIver, who is imprisoned for drug trafficking, gave an erroneous account of the trial testimony of one of his patients, Leslie Smith. And a correction in this space on Sunday again referred incorrectly to that testimony. The only point Mr. Smith made in his testimony was that he acknowledged injecting drugs prescribed by Dr. McIver. Mr. Smith never raised the issue of whether he himself sold any drugs that were left over to buy other drugs. And he never referred to Dr. McIver in the context of the leftover drugs — either that Dr. McIver sold them or did not sell them."

Grupo Bimbo makes and distributes Wonder Bread only in Mexico, where it has acquired the rights from Wonder Bread’s parent, the Interstate Brands Corporation. Grupo Bimbo does not own Wonder Bread. The error was pointed out by Grupo Bimbo shortly after the article appeared. This correction was delayed while another question about the article was researched."

It's always tempting to look for salvation in disaster, but in this case it's sheer fantasy. The Palestinian ruin was a long time in coming.

How often can the Met offer the exultant ''Fidelio,'' after all, and how often does it offer the star-crossed ''Bohème''? And how often can the Philharmonic present Tchaikovsky's ''1812''? So it was a good choice to end the Brooklyn Philharmonic's little concert at the South Street Seaport on Saturday night with Handel's ''Music for the Royal Fireworks'' as accompaniment for a dazzling display of pyrotechnics by the Zambelli family, set off from barges in the East River. Not that Handel could have anticipated the firepower available to 21st-century revelers. Loudly amplified as it was, the music was no match for the bone-rattling percussion from the sky."

2007-06-19T00:00:00Z,"di MAYORCA--Enrica, affectionately known as Kicca to her many friends and Nonna to her seven grandchildren, died Saturday, June 16th, in Summit, New Jersey. Born in Milan, Italy, in 1935, Kicca spent her childhood and youth with her brother, Paolo, and her beloved sister Laura, playing competitive tennis and enjoying their parents country home in Alzate, Brianza. Kicca and her siblings gathered at Vill'Angela in Longone for many joyous years, strengthening the bonds of their growing families, which eventually included their seven children. Kicca deeply loved her nieces and nephews and was proud that the cousins remained close friends even though distance separated them. Kicca moved to the United States in 1968 with her husband, Giampiero di Mayorca, who was a microbiologist. They lived in Omaha, Nebraska, Chicago, Illinois, and moved to Summit, New Jersey in 1978, when her husband became the Chairman of the Microbiology Department at UMDNJ. Everyone who knew Kicca will remember her kindness. She was truly interested in others, always supporting her family and friends with thoughtfulness, warmth, humor and grace. Having earned her baccalaureate at the University of Grenoble in France, Kicca was able to extend her kindness and knowledge to Summit High School, where she volunteered, teaching French and working in the office. She was a mother and advisor to many of her and her childrens' friends, many of whom considered her their adopted sister and mother. Many other talents can be attributed to Kicca. She was an artist who decorated fine China with her own exquisite floral designs, a fabulous cook, whose Italian tomato sauce and pasta can never be forgotten or duplicated, a collector of art whose taste in interior design served as an inspiration to all, and a master bridge player who was most happy to teach difficult conventions and technical logistics. Her love of family was the force, which motivated her life. She is survived by her brother Paolo, her sister, Laura, her daughter Emilia Fabricant and her husband Bob, her son Marco and his wife Ashley, and her seven beloved grandchildren, Kicca, Maria, Matteo, Bobby, Caterina, Ethan and Federica. Anyone who knew Kicca will appreciate the simple truth in her grandson's poem to her, illustrated with a tiger, and written especially for her: Roses are red, violets are blue. No one has a bigger heart than you! A memorial service will be held at St. Teresa of Avila in Summit, New Jersey on Wednesday, June 20th, 2007 at 10:45 am. Arrangements by Paul Ippolito Summit Memorial, 7 Summit Ave., Summit, NJ (www.ippolitofuneralhomes .com).

Earlier in his career with the CIA he was the Deputy Chief of the Soviet Division of the Clandestine Services, a Base Chief in Germany, Assistant to the Director of Central Intelligence, Allen Dulles, and held an unprecedented assignment to the White House that included the period of the Cuban Missile Crisis. During WWII, Mr. Parrott served with the Army in North Africa and Italy. He was awarded the Soldier's Medal (the Army's highest decoration for heroism not in actual combat), the Legion of Merit, and honored by Italy with the Order of Sts. Maurizio and Lazarus (at the time the oldest order of nobility in Europe). He retired from the Army Reserve as a Colonel. After retiring from the CIA in 1973, he was active in many charitable and community organizations. He served on the Board of the Washington Hospital Center as Vice-Chairman, was one of five founding directors of the National Rehabilitation Hospital, was an officer of the Citizens Association of Georgetown, served on the boards of the Foundation for the Preservation of Historic Georgetown, the Hospice Care of D.C. and was on the original Board of the City Tavern Club. He graduated from Princeton University in 1936 and had lived in Washington, D.C. since 1949. Tom Parrott is survived by his loving wife of 67 years, Barbara, of Washington, his daughters, Cynthia MacNair and Susan Crary, his son-in-law Horace Crary, Jr. and three loving grandchildren, Gardner, Nicholas and Ian Crary, all of NYC. His son, Tommy, predeceased him. Tom Parrott's sharp mind, wit, loyalty and love will be deeply missed. Services will be held at Arlington National Cemetery September 28 at 11:00am. Contributions in his memory may be made to the National Rehabilitation Hospital, Attention: Communication & Development, 102 Irving St. NW, Washington, DC 20010."

Articolo (articolo.com), their online retail store, sells nothing but tables, all created exclusively for them. Of the 29 modernist offerings, 12 were designed by Ms. Frattini; the others are by Mr. Magnusson, James Irvine, Ross Lovegrove, Hans-Jörg Ruch, Christoph Böninger, Neil Frankel, Gianfranco Frattini (Ms. Frattini's father), Marta Laudani and Marco Romanelli.

2007-06-21T00:00:00Z,"For at least a generation, press critics have complained bitterly about the news media's obsession with polls and the horse-race aspect of the presidential campaign. The constant focus on who is ahead is a pointless distraction, those critics argue, from what should be the real substance of the campaign, like what the candidates would do as president. But there is another reason to avoid putting too much stock in any assessment of the horse race, more than six months before the voting begins in the Iowa caucuses: It may have very little relationship to the ultimate outcome."

The quarry, which has 25-foot cliff walls, is planted with ferns, hostas and a rare variegated aralia. The garden also has paired 100-foot perennial borders and a woodland path that follows a stream and a waterfall. The other private gardens are a terraced property with a sculpture collection and a one-acre site with a vegetable and cutting garden and espaliered apple trees. The gardens are within walking distance of one another, and will be open from noon to 4 p.m. Admission is $5 a garden. Information: (888) 842-2442 or gardenconservancy.org/opendays."

Nothing has turned more ordinary people into shutterbugs than recent price drops in digital S.L.R. (single-lens reflex) cameras. These big, black, interchangeable-lens cameras may not fit in your pocket, and they may scream, ''I'm a tourist'' when hanging from your neck, but their photos blow those little shirt-pocket cams out of the water. Digital S.L.R.'s turn on instantly, can take three shots per second, offer optional manual controls, go for weeks on a battery charge and have zero shutter lag. In short, they're awesome."

2007-06-22T00:00:00Z,"Prime Minister Shinzo Abe delayed the critical upper house election by a week, to July 29 from July 22, by extending Parliament&#8217;s current session by 12 days, in what was seen as a desperate move to regain popular support and dampen widespread anger over the government&#8217;s admission that it had misplaced payment information for millions of pensioners. Polls show that support for Mr. Abe and his Liberal Democratic Party has fallen dangerously low among potential voters, with the main opposition Democratic Party scoring higher in some polls. A significant defeat could put pressure on Mr. Abe to step down as party leader and prime minister, though his party would keep the prime minister&#8217;s post through its control over the lower house."

The chairman of the council, Tahir Ashrafi, said that since Mr. Rushdie, who is considered a blasphemer by many Muslims in Pakistan, had been given the title “Sir,” then Mr. bin Laden, a holy warrior in the eyes of the council, should be given a parallel title. The gesture was a more lighthearted reaction to the honor for Mr. Rushdie than the noisy protests of demonstrators in some cities of Pakistan. On Monday, Pakistan’s Parliament passed a resolution condemning the knighthood and said it should be withdrawn."

The chairman of the council, Tahir Ashrafi, said that since Mr. Rushdie, who is considered a blasphemer by many Muslims in Pakistan, had been given the title ''Sir,'' then Mr. bin Laden, a holy warrior in the eyes of the council, should be given a parallel title. The gesture was a more lighthearted reaction to the honor for Mr. Rushdie than the noisy protests of demonstrators in some cities of Pakistan.

Ms. Wight, 48, a specialist in ancient glass, has risen from intern to associate curator to acting curator, a post she assumed in October 2005 when Marion True resigned over what the museum said were improprieties involving a real estate deal. (Ms. True has also been on trial in Italy since November 2005, on charges of trafficking in illegally excavated objects.) In a statement issued Wednesday the museum said that Ms. Wight had a major role in last year's reopening of the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, Calif. And as the Greek and Italian governments have laid claim to dozens of items in the antiquities collection, the Getty said, Ms. Wight has dealt with the issue ''with steadfastness and calm authority -- and a very clear vision for the future.'' She will oversee a staff of eight, the permanent antiquities collection and related exhibitions and programming at the villa, the museum said."

2007-06-22T00:00:00Z,"Far too many literary adaptations wear the fancy dress of high culture prestige or bind themselves into corsets of reverence. Pascale Ferran's ''Lady Chatterley'' is different, and not just because it is a costume drama whose main characters frequently appear unclothed. It is hardly a canonical or faithful rendering of D. H. Lawrence's once-scandalous novel -- Ms. Ferran based her film on an earlier, less notorious version of the book and made Lawrence's earthy English lovers profess their amours en français -- but who needs that anyway? This ''Lady Chatterley,'' winner of five César awards in France, feels bracingly fresh, vital and modern. It is easy to forget just how modern Lawrence was, and remains. Even books that were daring in their day have a way of becoming respectable with the passage of time, as they are folded into the educational curriculum and the other machinery of middlebrow culture. Ms. Ferran restores Lawrence to the present partly by placing his themes in the service of her own sensibility."

2007-06-22T00:00:00Z,"'MEMORY COMES FROM DARK EXTENSION' Hints of Surrealism flit through Richard Tuttle's handsome and lovingly assembled small relief sculptures at Sperone Westwater. But Minimalism is the touchstone, as it has been throughout this 66-year-old artist's long, distinguished career as an improvisational objectmaker. In July 2005 he was honored with a retrospective that toured nationally. There is a poetic vision running through the present show, resulting in artworks that look both beautiful and intriguing. Each construction is made from simple materials (typically paper, plastic, wood, wire, foil, paint, pencil) and affixed to the wall with a miniature brace that projects it forward. From a distance the sculptures seem to be floating, like pieces of space debris. Up close you are reminded of the unstable scaffoldings of Picasso's object constructions and papiers collés (collages of pasted paper) and the delicate wood relief sculptures of Hans Arp. A consistent, individual technique links the approximately 60 works here: geometric shapes are cut from paper, folded in unusual ways, painted and then combined intuitively with other elements to create objects governed only by the limits of the artist's imagination. Neither labored nor facile, their grace, humility and dainty-poetic detail elicit depths of pleasure from the viewer. This is an inspiring, memorable show.

Mr. Brown said Mr. Rhodes repeatedly punched a 101-year-old woman while mugging her in the vestibule of her building on Highland Avenue in Jamaica Hills on March 4. She suffered a broken cheekbone.

2007-06-22T00:00:00Z,"Is it too early for a movie about the short, charmed life and horrible death of Daniel Pearl? It's a fair question, raised in echo of those voices that several years ago worried if it were too early for a movie about Sept. 11. Like all those who died that day, Mr. Pearl was a casualty of Islamist hatred of Western civilization. And, much as with those other terror victims, his murder has now inspired a mainstream movie meant to entertain as much as to instruct and enlighten, a movie that will be seen by some as vulgar proof of that same civilization's willingness to turn a buck on everything, including tragedy. And make no mistake, despite its pseudo-documentary grit and the imprimatur of the midcult art-house director Michael Winterbottom, ''A Mighty Heart'' is a precision-tooled Hollywood machine. Based on the memoir by Mariane Pearl, it was bankrolled by a studio division and comes attached to two of the biggest stars in the world, Brad Pitt, who served as one of its producers, and his partner and the film's heat-seeking star, Angelina Jolie. For some, these boldface names will be reason enough to snigger. But snigger too loudly and you may miss that ''A Mighty Heart'' is effectively fashioned, as jolting as it is polished, as well as a surprising, insistently political work of commercial art."

2007-06-22T00:00:00Z,"It has become a journalistic cliché and therefore an inevitable part of the prerelease discussion of ''Sicko'' to refer to Michael Moore as a controversial, polarizing figure. While that description is not necessarily wrong, it strikes me as self-fulfilling (since the controversy usually originates in media reports on how controversial Mr. Moore is) and trivial. Any filmmaker, politically outspoken or not, whose work is worth discussing will be argued about. But in Mr. Moore's case the arguments are more often about him than about the subjects of his movies. Some of this is undoubtedly his fault, or at least a byproduct of his style. His regular-guy, happy-warrior personality plays a large part in the movies and in their publicity campaigns, and he has no use for neutrality, balance or objectivity. More than that, his polemical, left-populist manner seems calculated to drive guardians of conventional wisdom bananas. That is because conventional wisdom seems to hold, against much available evidence, that liberalism is an elite ideology, and that the authentic vox populi always comes from the right. Mr. Moore, therefore, must be an oxymoron or a hypocrite of some kind."

2007-06-22T00:00:00Z,"POTOMAC THEATER PROJECT After 20 years of producing theater in and around Washington, the Potomac Theater Project is hoping to call New York City home again. An earlier incarnation of the group, the New York Theater Studio, was active here from 1977 to 1985. The company is ready for new challenges, said Cheryl Faraone, one of the three co-directors (with Richard Romagnoli and Jim Petosa), and New York will provide that. Being distinctive and relevant in a town full of theater companies is no easy feat, but Ms. Faraone said she was optimistic. ''Somehow the shape of the work we do and the voices that interest us are not replicated very much,'' she said, adding that the company focuses on ''socially provocative plays.'' The 21st repertory season, through July 14, includes ''No End of Blame: Scenes of Overcoming,'' above, a drama by Howard Barker about the censorship of art, and ''Politics of Passion: The Plays of Anthony Minghella,'' comprising three one-acts: ''Cigarettes and Chocolate'' ''Hang Up'' and a scene from the film ''Truly, Madly, Deeply.'' Beginning on July 3, the company will also present a free ''After Dark'' series featuring new works in various stages of development -- from readings to full productions -- following regular performances on selected evenings or on an otherwise dark night. Highlights from the series include ''Iphigenia 3.0,'' a one-act play described as ''inspired by and pillaged from the works of Charles L. Mee,'' and ''Jude's Law,'' by Lisa Velten Smith, about a female fight club out to change opinions about which is the dominant sex. The company's name might make it seem like a visiting troupe (''We have this horrible habit of geographic instincts to naming,'' Ms. Faraone said), but if all goes well New York is going to be home for a while. (''Politics of Passion,'' now in previews, opens Tuesday, and ''No End of Blame'' begins previews tomorrow for a Wednesday opening, Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, 800-838-3006, BrownPaperTickets.com; $18.

Happily for New York, they're sticking to their blazing metaphoric guns. Starting tonight one of the city's most flavorful events will be unleashing myriad feature-length and short films from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Thailand and Pakistan, the last represented by what's being billed as that country's first ''gore flick.'' In this genre-oriented festival, the Hong Kong action master Johnnie To (here with his sizzling gangster smack-down ''Exiled'') and that art-house cult by way of Korea, Park Chanwook (''I'm a Cyborg, But That's Okay''), earn pride of place alongside less-familiar names like Tetsuya Nakashima, from Japan (''Memories of Matsuko,'' above), and Ryu Seung-wan, from Korea (''City of Violence''). In the nearly unclassifiable pop-melodrama ''Memories of Matsuko,'' a lovely, lonely soul endures disgrace, murder, prostitution and one wretched boyfriend after another by disappearing into a kaleidoscopic fantasyland of her own feverish imagination, one as influenced by MTV as by ''The Wizard of Oz.'' Very bad things also await the five teenage boys who grow up at cross purposes in ''City of Violence,'' which combines the usual pulp basics (violence and sentimentality) with some rock-em, sock-em fight choreography.

The sworn affidavit, the first from an insider who is critical of the Pentagon process, was portrayed by detainees' lawyers as a crack in the military's disciplined defense of the procedures used to declare detainees properly held as ''enemy combatants.''"

Once the seeded players are positioned, the 96 other names are placed around them."

At the very front of the room, the spotlight has settled on Michael R. Bloomberg. Someone is reading an award citation for his work as mayor. Mr. Bloomberg oscillates. He bounces on his toes, nods his head. His eyes appear to be pinned open. Though he has not uttered a word, Mr. Bloomberg's body seems to all but scream: Get me out of here. It is easy to watch him going through the motions of the routine antics of public officialdom -- the giving of plaques, the issuing of proclamations, the receiving of medals -- and believe that he shows up only because, somehow, if just through body language, he can sneer at the ceremony. That the soul of a punk-rocker has been wrapped in custom-tailored suits."

I'm crossing over the Tehachapi Pass on Highway 58 out of Bakersfield, a windy old road lit only by the headlights of my car. By dawn I'll be passing through Joshua Tree National Forest, leaving California behind for the bright lights of Las Vegas. Of course, every one of those Vegas light bulbs will be turned off by the time I get there. The remnants of last night's light will have left the earth's thin atmosphere and pushed out toward Venus."

Hence the recent ransacking of the Broadway attic in search of retro-chic warm-weather wear. The Roundabout, which had a hit two Junes ago with ''The Constant Wife,'' is clearly hoping for another with John van Druten's ''OLD ACQUAINTANCE,'' in which two writers, friends since childhood, find themselves competing over a husband, a daughter and literary success. Though it has not been revived on Broadway since its premiere in 1940, when Jane Cowl played the ''serious'' Village novelist and Peggy Wood the matronly purveyor of trash, it became an echt ''women's picture'' in 1943, with Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins, and was remade in 1981 as the ecch ''Rich and Famous,'' with Jacqueline Bisset and Candice Bergen. Now the hysterics and bons mots are in the capable hands of Margaret Colin and Harriet Harris. Let the (beautifully dressed) catfight begin!

For wine lovers, a special bottle -- or a case for that matter -- makes a welcome gift. But the wine won't last forever, so why not include an accouterment that can be used for many bottles and years to come? If something in crystal suits the newlyweds, consider a classic gift, like stemware that was designed in the early 1900s and is still in production by the Austrian company that originally made it. For the more modern tabletop there are contemporary pieces that work just as well as their predecessors, like chillers and buckets in shiny stainless steel."

2007-06-24T00:00:00Z,"WHEN the piano rocker Ben Folds was invited to play the opening night of the Boston Pops this spring, the orchestra managers laid down a few ground rules: No swearing; avoid songs with risqué subject matter; don't comment on politics. This was supposed to be a gala evening of Champagne and hors d'oeuvres, not beer and groupies. They warned Mr. Folds that he would not be playing to his typical audience. But then, he said with a laugh, ''I get up there, and there's a fistfight.'' The scuffle that erupted between two concertgoers in the balcony of Symphony Hall on May 9 -- a dispute over noise, it seems -- quickly became fodder for late-night comedians, as well as a widely swapped YouTube clip. Oddly, the brawl didn't take place during Mr. Folds's set but while the orchestra was playing selections from the score to the film ''Gigi.''"

2007-06-24T00:00:00Z,"The Twenties were just starting to roar when New York and New Jersey agreed to quit feuding over their mutual waterway, the one with the Statue of Liberty in its center. The two state governments created what is now called the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The treaty gave each governor the right to appoint half the agency's board members. Since then, this strange organizational bird has been running the port, and over time has taken on the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the George Washington Bridge, various bus terminals, and the Newark, La Guardia, Kennedy and Teterboro airports. The authority, which also owned the World Trade Center, now controls most of the complicated downtown reconstruction project, including the Calatrava PATH station, the memorial, the Freedom Tower and the foundations for other skyscrapers."

She faces 25 years in prison. But the basis for her conviction, a videotaped confession, is highly dubious. Indeed the Bedessie case, like so many others before it, points out the need for legislation that would prevent confessions from being the sole reason for a conviction and that would require the police to videotape all parts of an interrogation, including the lead-up to a confession that could have been obtained by coercion."

If it is used merely to teach students how to mimic middle-class behaviors, then some of the criticism may be justified. But if it is used to teach and alter the behavior of teachers, and the approach of schools, so that an effective education is provided to all students -- not just those from the same background as the teacher -- then it would seem that she is fixing the system."

These lasers and L.E.D.'s do not beam white light, but rather its three basic building blocks: red, green and blue.

When the LP record was invented in 1947, they started printing album covers. With the advent of lithography they joined with Jack Hecht in 1950 to create Queens Lithographing Corp. in Long Island City. With the growth of album sales in the sixties. Queens Litho printed all Beatles and Rolling Stones LPs and the company grew rapidly. During that period the company opened factories in Edison, NJ and Indianapolis. In 1964 the company displayed an operating printing press on the floor of Grand Central Station. The volume of music packaging exploded in the eighties with the introduction of the compact-disc and the company added a factory in Louisville to handle the growth. The company changed its name to Queens Group Inc. Packaging for Home Video, Video games and Software created the need for added capacity and the company built two factories in North Carolina. The company also produced high quality packaging for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and private label. The company was sold in 1998 and is now part of International Paper. A philanthropist, Mr. Kaltman actively supported UJA-Federation, MOMA, Julliard School where he endowed a scholarship, NSUH-LIJ Health System and the Botanical Gardens in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. Martin was a founder of American Friends of Boystown Jerusalem and his company donated a printing press to the school in Israel.

In that decision, the judges reversed a federal district court and threw out a case against the investment banks that are accused of helping to make the Enron fraud possible."

2007-06-24T00:00:00Z,"INVESTMENT newsletter editors are markedly less optimistic about the stock market now than they were late last year, when the Dow Jones industrial average was a thousand points lower. This suggests that the bull market may run a while longer, according to the market timing theory known as contrarian analysis. The theory is based on the historical tendency of investors to be wrong about the stock market's direction, especially at major turning points. Investors tend to assume that what has happened will keep happening: they become progressively more bullish as the stock market rises, and increasingly bearish as it declines. Market tops are reached when there are very few bearish holdouts; most everyone who could be tempted to invest in the stock market has already done so -- leaving little cash on the sidelines to propel equities higher."

He never shot a proper video for it, but the song nevertheless climbed up the country charts, thanks to a pickup line that has already earned a place in Nashville infamy: ''I'd like to check you for ticks.'' It's the kind of come-on you don't soon forget, especially once you hear Mr. Paisley expand on it. ''Ooh, ooh, you never know where one might be,'' he sings, and what woman could resist a man that thorough?"
2007-06-24T00:00:00Z,"ODD things come out of the woodwork when you move offices, as The New York Times did recently. Among the items unearthed were a number of unusual, even bizarre CDs: a testament to humankind's ability to master the unlikeliest of instruments and to carve the classical music audience into the tiniest of niches. Hearing these CDs provided the thrill of listening to fantastically accomplished practitioners of the esoteric. Some are great musicians to boot. Here is a dog's breakfast of recordings saved from the mover's purgatory. KALEVI AHO: CONTRABASSOON, TUBA CONCERTOS (Bis Records) Mr. Aho is an accomplished Finnish composer with a penchant for large works and concertos. Here he plumbs the depths, writing for two of the lowest instruments in the orchestra. Somewhat sadistically, he also writes into the upper registers, although the really low notes are the most thrilling. While written on a large scale, the concertos have many chamber music passages and moments of interplay between the soloist and other instruments."

The show, which opens Thursday, surveys Mr. Stingel's career -- his unorthodox materials also include rubber and painted aluminum -- and features a new site-specific work. The exhibition represents something of a return to the Whitney for Mr. Stingel, whose work was part of the museum's 2006 Biennial.

2007-06-24T00:00:00Z,"In sports that require athletic skill, an aging star's decline is easy to understand. In chess, though it can be exhausting, it seems strange to see champions struggle as they age. How champions past their prime confront their decline says much about who they are. Three great champions, Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi, have taken three different paths."
2007-06-24T00:00:00Z,"ANYONE who follows technology or military affairs has heard the predictions for more than a decade. Cyberwar is coming. Although the long-announced, long-awaited computer-based conflict has yet to occur, the forecast grows more ominous with every telling: an onslaught is brought by a warring nation, backed by its brains and computing resources; banks and other businesses in the enemy states are destroyed; governments grind to a halt; telephones disconnect; the microchip-controlled Tickle Me Elmos will be transformed into unstoppable killing machines. No, that last item is not part of the scenario, mostly because those microprocessor-controlled toys aren't connected to the Internet through the industrial remote-control technologies known as Scada systems, for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition. The technology allows remote monitoring and control of operations like manufacturing production lines and civil works projects like dams. So security experts envision terrorists at a keyboard remotely shutting down factory floors or opening a dam's floodgates to devastate cities downstream."

''Picasso adored her,'' reports John Richardson, his biographer. He was not alone. The fun-loving Sara, whose engagement photograph graced the cover of Town & Country magazine, attracted quite a few artists and novelists. Fitzgerald ''was madly in love with her,'' her grandson John Donnelly said in an interview, adding that in the family there were whispers of an affair with Ernest Hemingway. ''Grandmother would go down to Key West for visits,'' he said. ''Grandfather didn't go along. He didn't like Hemingway. He thought he was a bully.''"

But let's get real: if a Porschephile's transportation needs call for an S.U.V., why should she, or he, have to shop elsewhere? The newly redesigned Porsche Cayenne, which first appeared as a 2003 model, remains a study in contrasts. It is, with apologies to 914 devotees, the ugliest Porsche ever. Yet, for an S.U.V., it is comparatively handsome. Maybe that is why it appeals to so many women."

A fifth consecutive victory would match Bjorn Borg's modern men's record for consistency and put Federer two Wimbledon championships behind the career leaders, including Pete Sampras. It would also give Federer 11 Grand Slam titles, the same as Borg and three short of Sampras's mark. But it will not get him any closer to winning the French Open. And as Wimbledon begins Monday, the chatter is not so much about whether the top-seeded Federer will win again, but what it really means if he does."

2007-06-24T00:00:00Z,"Nels Cline Singers Free-bop, indie rock and chamber pop knock about with arresting results on ''Draw Breath'' (Cryptogramophone), the third album by the Nels Cline Singers. Led by the guitarist Nels Cline, the group includes no actual singers, just Devin Hoff, a bassist, and Scott Amendola, a drummer. But as the band name and album title both suggest, there's a vocal imperative at work here, a sense of respiring and descanting as one. This technique derives from avant-garde jazz, and at specific moments -- notably the first section of ''Mixed Message,'' a bristling group improvisation -- the lineage feels explicit. Elsewhere experimental rock provides a clearer context. (Check ''Mixed Message'' again, this time for the raucous last five minutes.) ''Confection'' could sit companionably on a Sonic Youth album; ''Squirrel of God'' is a stormy-turned-sunny rumination with percussion by Glenn Kotche, Mr. Cline's colleague in Wilco. And given the various strains of abrasiveness on the album, it seems worth noting that the centerpiece is a glimmering waltz called ''The Angel of Angels,'' one of the prettiest and most radiant offerings of Mr. Cline's career."
2007-06-24T00:00:00Z,"SIEGEL--Herbert also known as ''The Merchant Prince of Sag Harbor'' passed away peacefully on Friday, June 22, 2007. Herbert is survived by the love of his life of over 66 years Claire Siegel, his three children Shelly, her husband Paul, Allan ''his Shicksa goddess-Lisa'' and Jed and his wife Jane. Herbie loved Paul (his schmuck son-in-law) and Jane like his own children and took great pride in all of his families accomplishments. Grandchildren Jocelyn-the Brats, David, Danielle, Stephanie, Alec and Ashley, Jessica and Howard and great-grandchildren Zoe and Brady and his French grandchildren Angel and Roxanne. Unfortunately, none of Herbies card games have survived him, however they are anxiously awaiting his arrival and have saved a spot at the table for him. Born on Faile St. in the Bronx he often said that he was going to end up there. A kind and generous man, he never got angry and never said no to his family. He had great wisdom and was always the voice of reason. He was fiercely anti-war, and had no trouble pronouncing those that initiated war as putzes. An avid boater and fisherman, Herbie sunk every boat he owned and was often found rooting for the fish. Herbert Siegel started his work career on Coney Island selling soda and melting ice cream on the beach. He later had a short stint as a weight guesser. He won the Irish Sweepstakes and bought himself a car, gave his father and best friend money to open up businesses and by weeks end he had blown his winnings. Herbie and his wife Claire opened up Young America Antiques in Sag Harbor where they sold ''one of a kind'' Americana to a growing list of friends. Never without a piece of chocolate, a smile and a funny comment, Dad will be missed by all of those lucky enough to have known him.

Born in Mielec, Poland, she moved to Vienna, Austria, in 1934 upon her marriage. After Germany's annexation of Austria, the couple escaped Nazism via Switzerland and Portugal, arriving in New York in December 1941. Together they founded Renette Foundation Corp. Working side-by-side, never a day apart, theirs was a strong and loving marriage; each reinforced the other's talents. The murder of her parents and her sister during the Holocaust was a trauma that gripped her until her last days. In 1997, she had a monument erected in Mielec in their memory and in that of their fellow Jewish victims. Although she gave outstanding service to her community and she supported various hospitals and yeshivas in the U.S. and Israel, she often requested anonymity and usually shunned recognition. But her legacy will live on through all those who benefited from her compassion and generosity. Anyone in need, whether personal or institutional, could always touch her heart. She will be missed and mourned by her nephews and nieces, Jack and Rachelle (Lily) Goldstein, Bruno and Harriet Goldstein, Jacques and Yvette Oliary, Miriam Millet and their families; her cousins, Jack and Edward Stroh, Sylvia Harvath (nee Berger) and their families.

Virtually every major scientific study and organization that has weighed in on the issue has seen no link. But many parents of afflicted children remain unconvinced. Their lawyers will try to prove that some 4,800 children were harmed by the mass vaccination campaigns that protect the nation's youngsters from potentially devastating childhood illnesses. There seems little doubt that the child at the center of the first of the cases -- Michelle Cedillo of Yuma, Ariz. -- has classic symptoms of autism: impaired social interaction, limited ability to communicate, and unusual repetitive behavior. Her mother says she developed a high fever a week after she received the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella at the age of 15 months and soon after could not speak and was unresponsive."

2007-06-24T00:00:00Z,"The stones at Machu Picchu seem almost alive. They may be alive, if you credit the religious beliefs of the ruler Pachacuti Yupanqui, whose subjects in the early 15th century constructed the granite Inca complex, high above a curling river and nestled among jagged green peaks. To honor the spirits that take form as mountains, the Inca stoneworkers carved rock outcrops to replicate their shapes. Doorways and windows of sublimely precise masonry frame exquisite views. But this extraordinary marriage of setting and architecture only partly explains the fame of Machu Picchu today. Just as important is the romantic history, both of the people who built it in this remote place and of the explorer who brought it to the attention of the world. The Inca succumbed to Spanish conquest in the 16th century; and the explorer Hiram Bingham III, whose long life lasted almost as many years as the Inca empire, died in 1956. Like the stones of Machu Picchu, however, the voices of the Inca ruler and the American explorer continue to resonate."

''We were totally gung-ho to make really revolutionary independent movies,'' Mr. Kurtzman said in a recent conversation. ''We wanted to throw $50,000 into some movie and just make it.'' Sure enough, Mr. Kurtzman and Mr. Orci, both 33, ended up as screenwriters -- for movies that cost roughly 1,000 to 3,000 times as much. And while their scripts may deal with the knotty details of relationships, they are usually concerned with, say, the bonds between on-the-lam lovers who discover that they're clones, or a squad of hulking robots able to transform themselves into all manner of motor vehicles."

The commander, Gen. David H. Petraeus, said in recent days that his report would be only a snapshot of trends, strongly suggesting he will be asking for more time. But even before he composes the first sentences of the report, to be written with the new American ambassador in Baghdad, Ryan C. Crocker, the administration is commissioning other assessments that could dilute its findings about the impact of the current troop increase. The intent appears to be to give President Bush, who publicly puts great emphasis on listening to his field commanders, a wide range of options."

Now, several manufacturers are replacing these bulbs with lasers and light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s. These lasers and L.E.D.'s do not beam white light, but rather its three basic building blocks: red, green and blue. Beams are emitted in a narrow band of wavelengths very close to those of single, pure colors, giving off the brilliant, saturated red of a blazing sunset or the shimmering, luminous blue of a rainbow."

Yet it recounts only half of New York's baseball heartbreak in 1957. The New York Giants also pulled up their deep roots that year, but memories seldom invoke their own calculating principal owner, Horace Stoneham.

This suggests that the bull market may run a while longer, according to the market timing theory known as contrarian analysis. The theory is based on the historical tendency of investors to be wrong about the stock market's direction, especially at major turning points. Investors tend to assume that what has happened will keep happening: they become progressively more bullish as the stock market rises, and increasingly bearish as it declines. Market tops are reached when there are very few bearish holdouts; most everyone who could be tempted to invest in the stock market has already done so -- leaving little cash on the sidelines to propel equities higher."

In the months leading up to the big debut, expectations ran high, with the hope that Britain's already-strong commercial real estate industry would further flourish.
