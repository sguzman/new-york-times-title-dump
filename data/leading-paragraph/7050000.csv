The downside: some cost as much as the kayak."

2008-03-21T15:12:18Z,"Update: Western Kentucky wins, 101-99, in a crazy finish. The final series was started by a huge mental error by Western Kentucky's Boris Siakam. Perhaps thinking his team was losing he fouled Leonard Houston out at half court with less than a minute left. But Siakam made up for it on the other end by grabbing an offensive rebound and getting fouled on the putback. He made both foul shots to give the Hilltoppers a 1-point lead. On the other end Adam Emmeneker missed a shot. In the ensuing scuffle for the ball Western Kentucky's Tyrone Brazelton fouled Jonathon Cox. Cox made both free throws to give Drake a 1-point lead with 5.7 seconds remaining. The Hilltoppers then drove it down the court and Ty Rodgers hit a 30-footer to win it in the first buzzer-beating finish of this tournament."

While there are other, older Asian-American companies in New York -- the Ma-Yi Theater Company (19 years old) and Pan Asian Repertory Theater (going on 31) come to mind -- Second Generation has been carving out its own identity, just as its predecessors did. According to Lloyd Suh, the company's artistic director, Second Generation collaborates with other local companies (he is even a director of the Ma-Yi Writers Lab), but also maintains an individual perspective. ''Asian-American theater is in a really interesting place right now because with previous generations there was an introspective way of looking at it, looking at an identity politic,'' he said. ''This current generation of Asian-American artists is looking at a broader range of issues from an Asian-American lens. Instead of looking inward, we are looking out.''"

They and other miniature melodramas make up ''Really Rosie,'' above, the latest production from Atlantic for Kids, the youth-oriented wing of the Atlantic Theater Company.

The writer Gary Giddins is one of its most acute and insightful critics. So the prospect of a conversation between them carries weight for a certain segment of the population. Such an event isn't unprecedented -- as recently as 2005 Mr. Rollins appeared under the auspices of the New Yorker Festival with Stanley Crouch, another critic of serious repute -- but it does command fresh attention. Mr. Giddins has been one of Mr. Rollins's fiercest champions over the years. He has also described this tenor saxophonist as ''jazz's most provocatively enigmatic man.'' His assessments of Mr. Rollins, above, have not only shaped public perceptions but have also had a more material impact: a dozen years ago, after the publication of a Village Voice essay arguing the selective merits of Mr. Rollins's Milestone Records catalog, the label credited Mr. Giddins with the concept behind ''Silver City: A Celebration of 25 Years on Milestone.''

As the roguish but deceased sea captain in the 1947 movie ''The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,'' Harrison, not allowed such invective, does quite nicely with ''Blast!'' And soon the spunky widow, Mrs. Muir (Gene Tierney, above with Harrison), is matching blasts with Harrison's Capt. Daniel Gregg, the black-turtlenecked, Keats-quoting, devilishly goateed swashbuckler-about-the-house. Harrison, who was born on March 5, 1908, and died in 1990, is being celebrated at the Museum of Modern Art. Joseph L.

She grew up in Connecticut and New Jersey and attended Loomis Chaffee School and St. Margaret's School. She was an alumna of Centenary College in Hackettstown, NJ. She is survived by her husband, Sidney Stires, her sister, Gail Lohman Raleigh, her children; Wicks, Martha (Glenn Wright), Annie (John Carter), and Tom (Emily), her nephew, David Raleigh, and her 13 grandchildren. Judy was married for 53 years to her loving husband and best friend Sidney Homer Stires. They raised their family in New York City and Bay Head, NJ. For the last 20 years, Sid and Judy also lived part of the year in Venice, Italy. Over many years, Judy was a volunteer at The Boys Club of New York in the Youth Education programs. She was devoted to St. Thomas Church, and to St. Thomas Choir School. Judy was known for her joyful spirit, her great sense of style, her playful humor, and her love of music. She engaged people of all ages, and loved knowing all about their lives, their friends, their plans. Her family marveled at the energy she gave to every task, and her tasks were often labors of love that others had forgotten about or given up on. Judy was also tireless in her willingness to help the dependent know the happiness that she and Sidney had found in their life of sobriety. She volunteered in that effort for years at The Freedom Institute of New York City, but much of her work was done in the form of counsel right on her front porch. She was a gifted messenger. Judy, above all, was a wonderful wife, and mother, and grandmother, who loved those roles. A memorial service will be held at St. Thomas Church, 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue at 3:00pm on Friday, May 2nd. Gifts in Judy's memory can be made to The Freedom Institute, 515 Madison Avenue, 26th fl, New York, NY 10022. www.Freedominstitute.org."

But Ma's talk of an Olympic boycott was well hedged, and his margin of victory suggests that the public wasn't buying the DPP's claim that China's behavior in Tibet was significant for Taiwan. In substance, the two issues are very different, in part because of the economic value that Taiwan represents for Beijing (see Adam's most recent post). And if Chinese leaders wanted to improve their general image in the wake of their Tibetan crack-down, what better was to do it than to make some positive gestures towards Taiwan?"

2008-03-22T00:00:00Z,"CBS has canceled the postapocalyptic drama “Jericho” for the second time in two years. Tuesday’s season finale will also be the series finale, the network said Friday. The series, which starred Skeet Ulrich and followed the events in a small Kansas town after nuclear attacks devastated cities across the United States, was first canceled in May 2007. A campaign by fans combined with data showing that the show was being recorded and watched outside its broadcast time persuaded CBS to order a short second season. But the show has performed poorly since the new episodes began appearing last month. The most recent episode attracted fewer than six million viewers and a 1.9 rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. “Without question, there are passionate viewers watching this program; we simply wish there were more,” Nina Tassler, the president of CBS Entertainment, said in a statement. Carol Barbee, an executive producer of “Jericho,” said she was “pursuing other venues” for the series, giving credence to reports that a cable network could pick it up."

2008-03-22T00:00:00Z,"A long legal dispute over the rights to the Beach Boys&#8217; name has been settled. After a two-day conference in Superior Court in Los Angeles, two original members of the group, Al Jardine and Mike Love, reached an agreement over use of the name on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported. The Beach Boys were founded in 1961 by Carl, Dennis and Brian Wilson, above; Mr. Love, their cousin; and a friend, Mr. Jardine. Dennis Wilson died in 1983, and Carl Wilson died in 1998. Mr. Love had sued Mr. Jardine, claiming Mr. Jardine improperly used versions of the name while fronting his own band. A federal judge ruled in 2000 that Mr. Jardine was engaging in trademark infringement for touring under names including Beach Boys Family &#38; Friends, and that Mr. Love, a co-founder and one of the original lead singers, was sole licensee of the name. A federal appeals court upheld that ruling in 2003. Mr. Love and Carl Wilson&#8217;s estate sued Mr. Jardine again in 2004 for $2.2 million in legal fees spent in the original litigation against him. It was that case, set for trial in April, that was settled this week. Details of the settlement were not disclosed, but lawyers suggested it could pave the way for a reunion of the band&#8217;s three surviving founders."

At 10, the network&#8217;s &#8220;Lipstick Jungle&#8221; (7.2 million) delivered its best ratings since its debut in February, but still trailed ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Eli Stone&#8221; (7.5 million).

In this darkly humorous drama from Lasse Hallstrom, Richard Gere (above) plays Mr. Irving as a striving writer and recovering philanderer whose big break has just vanished. So he invents one. ''The brilliance of Mr. Gere's performance -- one of his best since middle age liberated his wily charm from his leading-man looks -- is that he makes you believe in Irving without believing a word out of his mouth,'' A.

But the early hour did not prevent Mussina and Igawa from dominating the younger hitters. Mussina gave up one run and three hits in seven innings while Igawa struckout eight in four scoreless innings. ""It wasn't bad,"" Mussina said. ""Ten o'clock in the morning. Full house."" When the spring started, Mussina was one of six starters competing for a spot in the five-man rotation. Mussina, who has 251 victories, said that he did not deserve a spot if he did not earn it.

2008-03-23T00:00:00Z,"Jennifer McSweeney The Penny McCall Foundation was established in 1987 by McCall and her husband, David, to support contemporary artists, writers and curators. When the couple died suddenly in 1999 in a car accident while volunteering in Kosovo, Penny's only child, Jennifer McSweeney, stepped in to take over her mother's tremendous philanthropic ventures. McSweeney, who previously worked as a professional chef, has become a keen and innovative talent in the art world, known for her outside-the-white-box thinking. Under the foundation's new designation, Creative Link for the Arts, McSweeney not only oversees the prestigious Ordway Award, which presents two $100,000 prizes (to a midcareer artist and a curator or arts writer) but also is devising new and unexpected ways to utilize donors, patrons and institutions in supporting the arts. Creative Link helped Art Production Fund bring Tim Noble and Sue Webster's ''Electric Fountain'' to Rockefeller Center this spring and will contribute to the catalog for Public Art Fund's New York City Waterfalls by Olafur Eliasson. (''There is not enough support for the documentation of these ephemeral installations,'' McSweeney says.) Such ''partnership philanthropy'' is only the beginning. ''All giving is good,'' she says. ''But if you can generate relationships that are more inspired and personal, it will only encourage everyone to keep giving in the future.'' Anne Pasternak ''I didn't want to be an assistant to any one artist,'' Anne Pasternak says. ''I wanted to help multiple artists realize their dreams.'' And in fact, some of the city's most obtrusive, skyline-altering artworks owe their existence to Pasternak and the arts organization Creative Time, where she has been president and artistic director since 1994. In those 14 years, Pasternak has helped artists take over city buses, the Anchorage under the Brooklyn Bridge, the Cyclone in Coney Island and, on multiple occasions, even the skies above Manhattan: in 2001 Vik Muniz ''drew'' clouds using a crop-dusting plane; in 2003 Cai Guo-Qiang put on a fireworks show in Central Park; and on election eve 2004, planes flew banners of political truisms by the artist Jenny Holzer. ''I'm not upset when art provokes people,'' Pasternak insists. ''My interest has always been to give artists a platform to ignite the imagination.'' In 2002, Creative Time collaborated with multiple artists on ''Tribute in Light'' -- two towers of light standing in for the fallen World Trade Center buildings. Having just helped Paul Chan stage ''Waiting for Godot in New Orleans'' in the city's lower ninth ward, the Creative Time team is initiating a number of summer projects, among them David Byrne's transformation of a landmark New York building into one gigantic musical instrument that the public will be able to play."
2008-03-23T00:00:00Z,"THE artist David Ellis isn't much for art. Having spent his youth banging on a Roland 808 drum machine, he admits that music, though not his forte, is more his thing. ''Art is so institutionalized, it can make people feel not invited,'' he said. ''Music has movement. It can cross borders.'' To give his work a similar kinetic quality, Mr. Ellis, above, photographs the progression of his paintings (at right), creating a time-lapse animation that is then set to sound. ''It's my attempt to move the art through time,'' he said of his ''motion paintings,'' which have been shown at the Museum of Modern Art."

Peter usually bikes, but occasionally he'll drive his hybrid Honda from where it's parked next to his xeriscaped yard to the Buddhist meditation classes he teaches downtown. He is, in short, the quintessential Boulderite. This town practically perspires virtue. Last April, Boulder became the first city in the country to impose an additional tax on residents who use electricity made from coal (households and businesses that opt to buy power from alternative sources are exempt). About a third of the total waste stream here is recycled. The city-run North Boulder Recreation Center has one of the largest solar hydronic systems in the country. The Boulder Outlook Hotel boasts about its ''zero-waste'' policy. Pizza delivery boys drive Priuses. The city is ringed by 43,000 acres of protected open space -- that's nearly three times the landmass of Manhattan -- and laced with 300 miles of greenways, trout-filled creeks and designated bike lanes."

2008-03-23T00:00:00Z,"When I tell people that I'm from Racine, Wis., I tend to get two responses: either ''Cheese heads!'' or ''Mars' Cheese Castle!'' The store just off Interstate 94 (technically in Kenosha) has always been popular with tourists craving cheese curds and waxy, cow-shaped cheddars. But a lot has happened to the cheese heads since I last visited 10 years ago. Wisconsin has joined the United States of Arugula, and its cheese producers, until recently outclassed by the offerings emerging from Vermont and California, have learned the magic word artisanal. Now more than 60 of the state's 114 plants (there were 2,800 in 1925) are manufacturing at least one handmade or small-batch cheese. The state took home a third of the gold medals at the 2006 World Championship Cheese Contest. There's even a blog, Cheese Underground, to follow award sweeps and other local news. Wisconsin's cheese renaissance reached a new high in September, when a former Lands' End merchandise manager opened a shop called Fromagination in Madison, dedicated to showcasing the cheeses of the world (and the state). On its second weekend in business, the place was a hive of boho-foodies browsing and grabbing toasts topped with braised boar, chestnuts and local sheep's milk cheese from a passing tray. The counter at the back of the shop was serving wine and craft-beer pairings; among the accouterments up front were DVDs of the documentary ''Living on the Wedge: Wisconsin's Artisan Cheesemakers (the Uncut Version).''"

No one was injured -- the local horse-drawn carriages seem to move at a faster clip -- and the mayor rode it the next day to reassure his citizens that the tram was safe. Still, not too many people were riding it recently. Sevillanos seem to raise a suspicious brow at ''progress,'' as this is a city that has always been tethered to its colorful and religious past: bullfighting, flamenco and Semana Santa, the holy week between Palm Sunday and Easter, when the streets are crowded with velvet-draped processions. Besides, most locals would rather walk through the historic center (cars were banned in most of the district in 2006), stopping to chat with friends, down a quick sherry at a bar or bless themselves in front of the Virgin Mother. There is a shrine, a statue or a plaque honoring her on nearly every cobblestone block."

2008-03-23T00:00:00Z,"Las Pozas seems like a myth, a kind of rain-forest mirage. The Surrealist sculpture garden was built more than four decades ago by the eccentric English artist Edward James 2,000 feet into the mountains of the Mexican jungle. It encompasses more than 80 acres of natural waterfalls and pools interlaced with towering Surrealist sculptures in concrete, including ''Bamboo Palace,'' a three-story structure with walls that look like shoots of bamboo; ''Stairway to the Sky,'' a Piranesi-like staircase that soars up several stories and ends in thin air; and ''Homage to Max Ernst,'' an outdoor aviary that is a forest of concrete columns. Las Pozas is near the village of Xilitla, a four-hour drive southwest of the nearest sizable airport, in Tampico, and seven hours north of Mexico City. Despite its remoteness (or, perhaps, because of it), the garden has long had a certain cult devotion. But since its sale last year, 23 years after James's death, to a consortium that includes two of Mexico's most prominent billionaires, Las Pozas has suddenly attracted fresh attention from preservationists and art-world luminaries intent on saving one of the world's most curious creations. The man who conceived this marvel had a curious life himself. James grew up on West Dean Estate, his family's 6,000-acre property in West Sussex, England. Having little interest in traditional English country life, he threw himself into the worlds of art and literature, writing volumes of poetry, publishing the work of Sir John Betjeman and collecting paintings from Dalí, Magritte and Picasso."

Which has supplied the president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who came to power in 1989 and whose term limit was waived last year by a parliamentary vote, with plenty of mad money. In 1997, Nazarbayev relocated the capital from Almaty (near the Kyrgyzstan border) to what is now Astana, and has since spent billions creating one of the world's strangest spectacles: an entirely new city, built almost from scratch over 96 square miles, in the center of the Eurasian steppe."
2008-03-23T00:00:00Z,"Every traveler has a landscape that, for him, contains the wonder and mystery behind all travel. It could be the beach, or a cathedral square, or the rain forest, or a volcanic island -- for me, it is the mountain pass. The mountain pass, roughly defined, is that point on the map where the winding road up is transformed into the winding road down. It marks the border where valleys meet, and often is where provinces divide, where one nation becomes another, with a corresponding change in language and road signs. To get to the mountain pass, you begin on a fertile plain, often crossed by a river, and drive through terraced fields and sleepy villages until the road gets steeper, the switchbacks get scarier and signs of human settlement fall away behind you. If you are in Tyrol -- the proud region straddling northern Italy and western Austria -- and you ascend through the Val Passiria to the mountain pass known in German as the Timmelsjoch, small vineyards and neatly tended orchards give way to a desolate moonscape fringed with ice, and the tractors from the lower altitudes, carrying bins of apples, are replaced by swarms of motorcycles. (You will later see the same bikers that passed you like movie villains in black leather warming up over plates of sausages and fries at the restaurant just beyond the pass, crowded into booths and chatting amiably with one another.)"

Vital's search for home informs his art -- symbolically and literally. ''A home is almost like a sculpture you can go inside,'' he says. He's building a place in Patagonia, Chile, and is searching for a studio in Beijing. ''I love to travel. I need to go in order to function.'' Not surprisingly, a modern-day nomad thrives on his connections. He cites a special bond to the Wodaabe people, nomadic pastoralists native to Niger. ''If you want to give them a present, you give them a mirror,'' he jokes, ''because they really know how to put makeup on in the morning.'' In Niger, it's not unusual for a spontaneous slumber party to occur chez Vital. ''Sometimes I would wake up and there's, like, 50 people sleeping in the courtyard.'' He recently had the artist Richard Long for a visit in Africa, and the architect Norman Foster has been a frequent guest. After reading that Gore Vidal is of Swiss origin and that his ancestors spoke Vital's mother tongue of Romansch (one of Switzerland's national languages), Vital tracked him down; now, ''I call him Cousin Gore.''"

2008-03-23T00:00:00Z,"there is nothing particularly Taiwanese about the Astoria Café. That's what made it special when Archibald Chien opened the place over a half century ago, on the west side of Taipei, the old downtown. The bakery sold fresh bread and homemade cakes downstairs. Upstairs, Chien served dark, bitter coffee, Italian style. Well, not really Italian. ''French,'' he told me. ''Swiss,'' he said, picking up a plate of perfect little cakes. Then he laughed. The coffee, the pastries and the cakes -- actually, all Russian. ''But we could not call anything Russian.'' Just about everything gets political in Taipei. Even dessert. History in Taiwan's capital has unfolded like a foreign-affairs soap opera. In the 1500s, mainland Chinese, mostly from Fujian Province, began to move here to farm. But the newcomers clashed with the locals, dozens of tribes with their own languages and cultures. Then, in the 17th century, the Dutch moved in. Then a Chinese faction, hostile to the new Qing dynasty that ruled the mainland, threw them out. Then the Qing army conquered the Chinese in Taiwan and put the island up for sale. When they couldn't find a buyer, they kept it until 1895, when Japan seized the land -- and things got really complicated."

That sounds crazy, but it really shouldn't come as much of a surprise: for decades, we've systematically razed nearly every patch of land we've been able to in an effort to create more room for industry, technology and people, without really paying attention to what's being lost in the process.

The lawyers and staff of the law firm Bryan Cave LLP mourn the passing of our dear friend and colleague Alan J.B. Aronsohn. Alan was a name partner and retired senior managing partner of our predecessor firm Robinson Silverman Pearce Aronsohn & Berman, having joined the firm in 1956. He was a nationally recognized expert in partnership and federal tax law and an outstanding real estate attorney. He wrote and lectured extensively in these practice areas. He was a major contributor to the growth and prominence of the firm. He had an incredibly sharp, incisive and creative mind. His brilliance and sense of fairness were recognized and admired by clients and other attorneys. He was a master at drafting complicated documents in a clear and concise manner. He was a strong, benevolent and compassionate leader of the firm for many years. He was deeply loved and highly respected by all who knew him. Alan was also extremely loyal to clients and colleagues. He will be sorely missed. Our heartfelt condolences to Alan's caring wife Bette, his children Lee, Abby and Judie, his grandchildren and the entire Aronsohn family."

She grew up in Connecticut and New Jersey and attended Loomis Chaffee School and St. Margaret's School. She was an alumna of Centenary College in Hackettstown, NJ. She is survived by her husband, Sidney Stires, her sister, Gail Lohman Raleigh, her children; Wicks, Martha (Glenn Wright), Annie (John Carter), and Tom (Emily), her nephew, David Raleigh, and her 13 grandchildren. Judy was married for 53 years to her loving husband and best friend Sidney Homer Stires. They raised their family in New York City and Bay Head, NJ. For the last 20 years, Sid and Judy also lived part of the year in Venice, Italy. Over many years, Judy was a volunteer at The Boys Club of New York in the Youth Education programs. She was devoted to St. Thomas Church, and to St. Thomas Choir School. Judy was known for her joyful spirit, her great sense of style, her playful humor, and her love of music. She engaged people of all ages, and loved knowing all about their lives, their friends, their plans. Her family marveled at the energy she gave to every task, and her tasks were often labors of love that others had forgotten about or given up on. Judy was also tireless in her willingness to help the dependent know the happiness that she and Sidney had found in their life of sobriety. She volunteered in that effort for years at The Freedom Institute of New York City, but much of her work was done in the form of counsel right on her front porch. She was a gifted messenger. Judy, above all, was a wonderful wife, and mother, and grandmother, who loved those roles. A memorial service will be held at St. Thomas Church, 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue at 3:00pm on Friday, May 2nd. Gifts in Judy's memory can be made to The Freedom Institute, 515 Madison Avenue, 26th fl, New York, NY 10022. www.Freedominstitute.org."

Marley&#8217;s family, including his son Ziggy Marley, executive producer of the Scorsese film, has refused to license any of his music for the Weinstein film, even though Marley&#8217;s widow, Rita Marley, is its executive producer. The Scorsese documentary is being produced by Tuff Gong Pictures, owned by the Marley family, and Steven Bing&#8217;s Shangri-La, which has licensed Marley songs. The family members say they believe the Weinstein drama&#8217;s release date, expected to be late 2009, would conflict with the planned opening of their documentary, February 2010.

Under the title “Jammin’ With the Beatles and Friends, Star Club, Hamburg, 1962,” the eight tracks are said to include Paul McCartney singing Hank Williams’s “Lovesick Blues” and Mr. McCartney and John Lennon singing “Ask Me Why.” Apple Corps, the London company formed by the Beatles, maintains that the songs were taped without their consent, and that Fuego Entertainment of Miami Lakes, Fla., and two sister companies have no right to distribute them. Apple’s lawsuit contends that the recordings are of poor quality and that circulating them “dilutes and tarnishes the extraordinarily valuable image associated with the Beatles.” Paul LiCalsi, a lawyer for Apple Corps, said, “This appears to us to be a garden-variety bootleg recording.” Hugo Cancio, the president of Fuego, said: “Don’t claim that these were just bootlegged. It’s not like today, that you just go in with a phone or BlackBerry and you record.” He added: “The world deserves to hear these tracks. The fact is that we have it, they don’t, and that is what’s bothering them.”."

Born in Lvov, Poland in 1920, Ann was brought to safety in New York by her Aunt Charlotte on the eve of World War II. Her entire family perished in the Holocaust. As a youth, she was a skilled athlete. Once in the USA, Ann began to work in the garment industry. She learned English in night school and after marrying, she started her American family. With Harold, Yiddishkeit and family became and remained the center of their lives. Moving to New Rochelle in 1956 she achieved success as a mother and recognition in the community in the Sisterhood of Temple Beth El and the Workmen's Circle. She became president of her chapter of Woman's American Ort. Ann was an avid reader and compassionate advocate for the disenfranchised. She was manager of the Balalaika Russian Night Club in NYC. With Harold, she also became a follower of the Arts and enjoyed both the great Yiddish cultural life in New York as well as theater, music and all of the Arts. She was a strong supporter of Russian Jewry and the State of Israel. She became a skilled artist and had a one woman show of her needlepoint. With Harold, Ann shared in building and maintaining many organizations (the Workmen's Circle (Arbiter Ring), Beth El Synagogue in New Rochelle, the Folksbienne Yiddish Theater).

The painting, &#8220;La Surprise&#8221; (about 1718), depicts a seated actor playing a guitar and glancing to his right at a couple amorously embracing. It was last noted in a probate valuation in 1848, when it was bequeathed to the family of the current owners, who had no idea what they had. A spokesman for Christie&#8217;s said, &#8220;It was found during a routine valuation in the corner of a small sitting room in an English country house.&#8221; The only other known version of the painting is a copy in the Royal Collection at Buckingham Palace.

2008-03-25T00:00:00Z,"Opponents of a plan to move the Barnes Foundation and its world-renowned art collection from a Philadelphia suburb to a downtown site asked a Pennsylvania judge on Monday to reconsider his 2004 decision allowing the relocation. Lawyers for the Friends of the Barnes Foundation, a community group, and for the government of Montgomery County, where the Barnes has been since its founding in the late 1920s, appeared before the judge, Stanley R. Ott of the Montgomery County Orphans’ Court in Norristown, to request that he reopen the case. Judge Ott’s ruling in 2004 permitted the foundation, which has struggled financially, to bypass the charter and bylaws of its founder, Albert C. Barnes, who stipulated that no picture in his collection could be lent, sold or moved from the walls of the galleries that he built in Merion. The judge said he considered the move “the only viable alternative” to save the Barnes from bankruptcy. But the opponents contend that the collection’s financial troubles have been overstated and that new ways to raise the money to prevent a move have emerged. The county has offered, for example, to buy the foundation’s buildings and land for $50 million or more to keep the collection in place. But lawyers for the foundation and for the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office argued before Judge Ott that the county’s plan had come too late and that it could expose the foundation to “extraordinary financial risk.”."

2008-03-25T00:00:00Z,"WIESEN--Tobie A., passed away on March 23, 2008, a few days before her 97th birthday, six years after the passing of her husband Irving of 60 years. To the end she was gracious, engaging and considerate; sophisticated, insightful and articulate, whether it be in English, French, Spanish or Russian --all of which she spoke with fluency. She held herself to the highest level of integrity and respect for others --if you sent her a card she thanked you by letter; regardless of your age, Tobie addressed you by your last name and title until you permitted her to call you by your first name. Holding a masters degree in education and having studied piano at the Julliard School of Music, Tobie - Antoinette Wiesen, daughter of Julie and Aaron Mnuchin, daughter-in-law of Rose and Max Wiesen, was a teacher of children and also a founder of the Junior Committee of The National Council of Jewish Women. She loved her son Jeremy, her grandson Gavin, her cousin Simone Rosen, her stepdaughter Barbara Prager; Barbara's daughters Karen and Emily, Karen's husband Will Balliett and their daughters Adelaide and Charlotte; and her many friends including Belinda Brackenridge, Bill Prager and Cynthia Witter. Her long devoted care-givers, Princessa Manuel, Dorothy Robinson and Irena Ivanov served lovingly like daughters for many years; and, Dr. Leonard Raifman was on-call as if he were treating his own mother. Tobie Wiesen cherished her brother; her brothers-and sisters-in-law; and nephews, nieces and their children --hardly forgetting a birthday. Relatives; neighbors; friends of Jeremy and Gavin; employees and colleagues; all learned from the hundreds of proverbs, Shakespearean soliloquies, poems and sonnets that Tobie would teach us; and her short-cuts for conjugating the subjunctive for pluperfect verbs in French and Spanish. Today, it is comforting to remember especially, ''en casa de tia, pero no cada dia''; ''petit a petit, loiseau fait son nit''; and a maxim of Pushkin by which she lived: ''If you have a thousand friends it is not too many; but one enemy is too much.'' Even in her later years, she firmly believed one's spirits should never falter so long as they have the beauty of poetry to lift them, often reciting from one of her favorites, William Wordsworths ''Daffodils'': ''For oft, when on my couch I lie In vacant or in pensive mood They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils.''"

So difficult, in fact, that Senator John McCain of Arizona has missed more than half of the roll-call votes since January 2007, more than any other senator except Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota, who spent most of 2007 recuperating from a brain hemorrhage. When Mr. McCain ran for president in 1999-2000, he missed just 30 percent of the Senate votes. Still, Mr. McCain has a long way to go to match the number of votes Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts missed when he ran for president in 2003-4: 72 percent.

2008-03-26T00:00:00Z,"SCHOTT--Michael B., Beverage Industry Exec, dies at 59. Michael Bennett Schott, age 59, died on March 24, 2008 after a valiant battle with brain cancer. Born in Cincinnati, OH, in 1948, to the late Cincinnati Police Chief Jacob Schott and his wife Dollie, Michael leaves behind his wife Evonne Stevenson Schott; his children, Kyle Louise, Chicago, John Chapin, Boston, Margaret Condon, San Francisco, Leslie Kathleen, Los Angeles, and Mark Edmund, Santa Cruz, CA; siblings Barbara Boyd (Jack Boyd, late), Jacksonville, FL, Jacob Schott (Donna), Cleveland, OH, and; step-children Samuel Joseph Stevenson and Thomas Scott Stevenson, Grosse Pointe Woods, MI. Mike graduated from Western Hills High School and was named All-American for his football prowess. Mike attended Ohio University on a full football scholarship and excelled not only on the field but in the classroom as well. After leading his team to an undefeated season and the 1968 Tangerine Bowl, he was inducted into the Ohio University Hall of Fame. Dr. Vernon Alden, then president of Ohio University and former Associate Dean of Harvard Business School, became Mike's mentor, guiding his decision to pursue a Masters in Business Administration at Harvard Business School rather than a professional football career. After graduation from Harvard in 1972, Mike began his career and eventual rise as the industry king in the beverage world. He returned to Cincinnati, with NuMaid Margerine where he met and married Roberta Louise Condon. As newlyweds they moved to the New York metro area and Mike began working for Pepsi Bottling Co. He eventually became president of Poland Spring Water, holding the position until the company's purchase by Perrier. Upon the sale of Poland, Mike moved back to Cincinnati, to be a partner in the Hudepohl Schoenling Brewing Co. In Cincinnati, Mike's family grew to five beautiful children. Not long after the birth of their youngest child, the family moved to Detroit where Mike turned his efforts to Don Lee Distributor. Within a year, the talented entrepreneur was tapped to launch AriZona Iced Tea. At AriZona, Mike further demonstrated his ability to improve operations and manage rapid sales growth in the beverage industry. He was quickly promoted into senior management at Nantucket Nectars, Snapple, SoBe, Everfresh, and others, eventually becoming the lynchpin in building Monster Energy, the backbone of the unprecedented growth of Hansen Beverage Company. During Mike's five years with Hansen, the company was named by Forbes Magazine as the number one small company in the U.S. in 2005 and 2006. In 2005, Mike Schott married Evonne Stevenson. Too soon thereafter, in October 2006, Mike was diagnosed with a Stage Four GBM brain tumor. Mike's work ethic and determination to succeed now faced an even greater challenge. He used this tragic turn of events as an opportunity to move medical science forward. Mike was a man who put his time, effort, and financial resources into supporting projects he felt would benefit the greater good. While his battle with cancer was eventually lost, the medical progress he forged with Genentech Inc. will continue to fight for those suffering from similar ailments for years to come. Mike was known for his work ethic based on his favorite sayings including attitude is everything, persistence and determination alone are omnipotent and from those to whom much is given, much is expected. His legacy will continue to grow through the Michael B. Schott Fund at the Hermelin Brain Tumor Center at the Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI."

Born in Cincinnati, OH, in 1948, to the late Cincinnati Police Chief Jacob Schott and his wife Dollie, Michael leaves behind his wife Evonne Stevenson Schott; his children, Kyle Louise, Chicago, John Chapin, Boston, Margaret Condon, San Francisco, Leslie Kathleen, Los Angeles, and Mark Edmund, Santa Cruz, CA; siblings Barbara Boyd (Jack Boyd, late), Jacksonville, FL, Jacob Schott (Donna), Cleveland, OH, and; step-children Samuel Joseph Stevenson and Thomas Scott Stevenson, Grosse Pointe Woods, MI. Mike graduated from Western Hills High School and was named All-American for his football prowess. Mike attended Ohio University on a full football scholarship and excelled not only on the field but in the classroom as well. After leading his team to an undefeated season and the 1968 Tangerine Bowl, he was inducted into the Ohio University Hall of Fame. Dr. Vernon Alden, then president of Ohio University and former Associate Dean of Harvard Business School, became Mike's mentor, guiding his decision to pursue a Masters in Business Administration at Harvard Business School rather than a professional football career. After graduation from Harvard in 1972, Mike began his career and eventual rise as the industry king in the beverage world. He returned to Cincinnati, with NuMaid Margerine where he met and married Roberta Louise Condon. As newlyweds they moved to the New York metro area and Mike began working for Pepsi Bottling Co. He eventually became president of Poland Spring Water, holding the position until the company's purchase by Perrier. Upon the sale of Poland, Mike moved back to Cincinnati, to be a partner in the Hudepohl Schoenling Brewing Co. In Cincinnati, Mike's family grew to five beautiful children. Not long after the birth of their youngest child, the family moved to Detroit where Mike turned his efforts to Don Lee Distributor. Within a year, the talented entrepreneur was tapped to launch AriZona Iced Tea. At AriZona, Mike further demonstrated his ability to improve operations and manage rapid sales growth in the beverage industry. He was quickly promoted into senior management at Nantucket Nectars, Snapple, SoBe, Everfresh, and others, eventually becoming the lynchpin in building Monster Energy, the backbone of the unprecedented growth of Hansen Beverage Company. During Mike's five years with Hansen, the company was named by Forbes Magazine as the number one small company in the U.S. in 2005 and 2006. In 2005, Mike Schott married Evonne Stevenson. Too soon thereafter, in October 2006, Mike was diagnosed with a Stage Four GBM brain tumor. Mike's work ethic and determination to succeed now faced an even greater challenge. He used this tragic turn of events as an opportunity to move medical science forward. Mike was a man who put his time, effort, and financial resources into supporting projects he felt would benefit the greater good. While his battle with cancer was eventually lost, the medical progress he forged with Genentech Inc. will continue to fight for those suffering from similar ailments for years to come. Mike was known for his work ethic based on his favorite sayings including attitude is everything, persistence and determination alone are omnipotent and from those to whom much is given, much is expected. His legacy will continue to grow through the Michael B. Schott Fund at the Hermelin Brain Tumor Center at the Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI."

The scaffold had collapsed on one side, and was tilted crazily at a 45-degree angle, the left (lower) end just outside our windows, resting on the shattered air-conditioner, and the right end somewhere out of sight, up on the ninth or tenth floor. At either end of the platform, workmen dangled perilously, both of them cradled in yellow safety harnesses, but helpless and hanging on ropes anchored to the parapet on the 17th floor."

2008-03-27T12:48:13Z,"Why do some political missteps haunt their candidates forever, while others are easily put to rest? John Kerry saying he voted for the war funding before he voted against it, or Howard Dean screeching on a stage in Iowa, instantly becomes the stuff of political history, but when George W. Bush admits that he was once arrested for driving under the influence, it immediately fades into obscurity. Some politicians, as they used to say of Ronald Reagan, seem coated in Teflon, while others seem covered in Krazy Glue, unable to shake the stickiness of what seem like minor embarrassments.Here's a political postulate for you: whether or not a bad moment sticks to the candidate depends on how closely related it is to the core rationale of that candidate or his opponent. In other words, if your gaffe goes directly to the main argument you are trying to make about yourself with the electorate, or if it substantiates the most relevant thing that your rival would have us believe about you, then it has the potential to become a serious problem. If, on the other hand, you do something completely idiotic that is tangential to what voters most hope or fear about you, then you tend to get a pass. So Mr. Kerry's choice of wording hurt because it played into the main theme that the Republicans had chosen to discredit him-the notion that he wanted to have everything both ways. By contrast, Mr. Bush's brush with the law had nothing to do with the story he was telling about himself as a competent manager, nor did it underscore the central argument that Democrats were advancing about him (because, really, there wasn't one)."

Mr. Yari sued after the Producers Guild of America and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences named only two people as producers for purposes of Oscar credit. He contended that the snub damaged his reputation, but the appeals court ruled that private organizations can make their own decisions about their awards.

2008-03-27T00:00:00Z,"HOUSTON -- Prior to his Thursday news conference, Texas Coach Rick Barnes was talking to several members of the news media when Memphis Coach John Calipari happened to walk by. Calipari said he wanted to ask a question, but Barnes asked him one first. ''I'm going to do a clinic in Austin and I need a free-throw shooting coach,'' Barnes said. ''Can you help me?'' The question elicited laughter. It was a none-too-subtle reminder that Calipari's top-seeded Tigers are shooting 59.2 percent at the free-throw line this season, ranking them 326th out of 328 Division I teams. Calipari, hardly fazed, responded with his own zinger. ''I think your point guard shot that airball,'' Calipari said. His quip was a reference to the final seconds of Texas's victory against Miami on Sunday when the sophomore D.J. Augustin's airballed a free throw. Barnes responded: ''Hey, that's what I'm talking about. I can't coach it. I need you.''"

2008-03-27T00:00:00Z,"MAY--John A. (Jack), 79, of Berwyn, Pennsylvania, a prominent lawyer and businessman, died suddenly Easter morning of heart failure at his second home in Hobe Sound, Florida. Mr. May, the son of A. John May and Sara Brothers McLaughlin, was born in Petoskey, Michigan on November 2, 1928. He grew up in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, graduated from Mercersburg Academy in 1946 and then attended Princeton University on an ROTC scholarship. A member of the Cloister Club, he graduated from Princeton with a degree in Economics in 1950. Following his first year at Harvard Law School, Mr. May was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army, serving as a forward artillery observer with the 18th Airborne Corps and 45th Infantry Division in Korea from 1951 to 1952, ending his active service as a Captain. He continued to serve as a reserve officer in the 108th Field Artillery, 28th Infantry Division of the Pennsylvania National Guard until 1957. Mr. May married Gwendolyn Abrahamsen in 1952. Mr. May received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1954. Mr. May joined the law firm of Duane, Morris and Heckscher (now Duane Morris LLP), headquartered in Philadelphia, in 1954.

2008-03-28T09:10:25Z,"There are times when the gestures available to the average New Yorker are just not sufficient. Wouldn’t it be great if there were a discreet sign you could make when you see a celebrity on the street and want to express admiration for his or her work, without interrupting any conversations or causing any discomfort? Wouldn’t a universally understood gesture be handy to express, while driving — “yikes, sorry, didn’t mean to cut you off, my mistake” — to pre-empt more common gestures that fly during such encounters? How about a polite one for “please put your knees together, mister, as you’re taking up three subway seats?”While certain gestures have become notorious lately, like that push-the-thumbtack into-my-teleprompter to-prove-a-point move that says “I want to be presidential,” or the facial expression through which a governor says, in effect, “I am swallowing my lips because I am so busted sorry,” there is a need for an expansion of the number of widely understood gestures."

2008-03-28T19:14:54Z,"Like Joyce, I found Stephen's comments about how ""Bonfire"" was received in the academic world - as an attack on Reaganism - to be very interesting, because for many years before the book came out Wolfe had been making his conservative beliefs well-known. Many people, myself included as a college student in the seventies, were shocked that Wolfe, the liberating stylist and journalist, turned out to be very antipathetic to liberals and leftish intellectualism in all its forms, political, literary, artistic and architectural. Yes, in about 1970 he had written ""Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers,"" but they were brilliant pieces that didn't necessarily demonstrate a systematic conservatism. By the late 1980s, though, Wolfe had written and lectured often about his conservative views, he had been a guest of Reagan's and Christopher Hitchens had called him the ""moth-eaten court jester"" for the White House. Wolfe would probably be amused that the academy was so insulated and so steeped in its own conventional wisdom that its members simply assumed that he agreed with them."

2008-03-28T00:00:00Z,"'JUNIE B. JONES' Here's a young heroine who inspires immediate sympathy. Entering a new grade, Junie B. Jones discovers that her closest pal, Lucille, has become the ''new best friend'' of snooty twins. Things on the school bus aren't better: Junie's former seat mate would rather ride with someone else. The day improves only when Herb, a new boy, sits next to Junie and begins to discuss going bowling together. These events may bring back vivid memories of middle school. Except that this isn't eighth grade; it's first. But the ability of ''Junie B. Jones'' to tap into the psyches of older children is one of its strengths. Even though some 6-year-olds may not identify with the precocious Junie, they will recognize her anxieties. And no 9- or 10-year-old taken to this musical, now being revived by Theatreworks/USA, can complain that the material is babyish. Smartly directed by Peter Flynn, it offers enough humor to tickle even adults."

2008-03-28T00:00:00Z,"TABAIMO An animation by the Japanese artist Tabaimo, 32, is always a spectacle worth seeing, what with the enormous screens, the eerie digitalization of the Ukiyo-e, or Japanese ''floating world'' woodblock style, and the Surrealistic erosion of innocence into violence, sex or self-abuse. In her ''dolefullhouse,'' a hit at last summer's Venice Biennale, giant hands arranging furniture in a dollhouse start scratching at the structure to reveal bleeding human flesh. Tabaimo's second solo show in New York centers on ''public conVENience,'' above, a three-screen work from 2006 set in a spacious restroom reminiscent of a train station (''ven'' is Japanese for public). Forgoing innocence, this piece progresses from weird to very weird, as the facilities are used in all sorts of symbolic ways. One woman dives into a toilet, another washes obsessively, a third gives birth to a baby through a nostril. Large moths fly about, their cameralike eyes snapping pictures for a voyeur lurking outside a small window. The roving viewpoints make voyeurs of the audience, revealing a particularly female world of isolation, vulnerability and obliviousness."

He is survived by his beloved wife of 50 years, Inger Marie, his two sons, Eric and Tony, his daughter Ellen, four grandchildren, and one greatgrandchild. Born in 1929 in Alexandria, Louisiana, Junius Edwards joined the Army at 18, served for nine years in Korea and Japan, and worked in the Judge Advocate General Corps and the Army Counter Intelligence Corps. After his honorable discharge he went to study at the University of Oslo, Norway using his GI Bill, where he continued to pursue his passion for writing. In 1958 he won first prize in the Writer's Digest Short Story Contest for ''Liars Don't Qualify'' and in 1959, he received a Eugene F. Saxton Fellowship for creative writing. His published work also includes short stories ''Duel with the Clock,'' ''Mother Dear and Daddy,'' and the novel ''If We Must Die''. His writing primarily focused on racial and personal problems faced by the African-American soldier and African-Americans living in the South. During the 1960s in New York, Junius Edwards worked as a copywriter for various advertising agencies such as Ogilvy & Mather, Ted Bates Inc., and Norman, Craig, & Kummel. He went on to establish Junius Edwards Inc., one of the first blackowned advertising agencies in New York City with clients that included Carver Federal Savings Bank, Faberge, Liggett & Myers, and The Greater New York Savings Bank.

2008-03-28T00:00:00Z,"NY UKEFEST 2008 When Stephen DiLauro decided to pick up the ukulele again several years ago, he should have seen it coming. After all, this was the instrument that in the early 1900s, fresh from Hawaii, had managed to win over millions of American devotees who bought recordings by Tin Pan Alley musicians like Ukulele Ike. This is the instrument that a generation later was resurrected by Arthur Godfrey, who peddled a plastic version on television. So when Mr. DiLauro, a guitarist, created a ukulele-playing persona called Uke Jackson in 2000, it should have been no surprise that the ukulele was on the cusp of a comeback driven by fringe musicians and that he would surrender his name to the instrument."
2008-03-28T00:00:00Z,"APRIL AT THE STONE Ever since the Stone, a nonprofit experimental-music space in the East Village, opened its doors three years ago, it has heeded a scrupulous guest-booking policy: Each month a different artist programs the calendar, according to his or her own designs. John Zorn, the artistic director of the Stone, calls these artists curators, and each month can be seen as an autonomous collection of works. This has been truer of some months than others, but as a general principle it works remarkably well. The Stone's April calendar is the work of Chris Speed, a clarinetist and tenor saxophonist in his early 40s, and one of the principal figures in a dynamic left-of-center jazz/improv scene around the city. Like most Stone curators, Mr. Speed put a lot of himself on the program: he has seven scheduled appearances. But with only one exception, he will be working as a sideman, in stellar groups led by the trumpeter Cuong Vu, the percussionist John Hollenbeck and the alto saxophonist Tim Berne, among others. Beyond those, the lineup draws from a pool of artists based in Brooklyn and parts more remote (including Germany, Iceland and Italy). Just about every night looks solid."

2008-03-28T00:00:00Z,"'T J & DAVE' AND 'TWO MEN TALKING' A latecomer could sit through an entire performance by this duo without realizing that there is no script. Without hearing their regular opening line, ''This is all made up,'' you might not gather that these Chicagoans are masters of long-form improvisation, creating an original, full-length play on the fly at every performance. They have won awards both at home and in New York for their efforts. T. J. Jagodowski, above right, and Dave Pasquesi, left, make periodic visits here with the show they have presented weekly for the last several years at the iO Theater. At each performance one of them starts by blurting out a sentence -- anything at all that he feels like saying at that moment -- and they build a story from there, playing multiple characters and somehow bringing it easily to a close about an hour later. Their onstage chemistry, comic instincts and never-miss-a-beat improvisation abilities, rather than audience suggestions, keep the evening flowing."

2008-03-29T11:52:54Z,"Re ""Playing Favorites? Don't Be So Sure"" (March 9):I've noticed some other, more subtle forms of bias - both in The New York Times and in other news sources - that I don't quite understand.For example, when Senator Barack Obama wins a state he is expected to, like Wyoming, the victory seems to be played down. But when Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton wins a state she was expected to, like Ohio, it is heralded as a major alteration of the nomination's dynamic.I can see this story line being developed for Pennsylvania, which is being framed as the crucial contest, but one that Mrs. Clinton begins with great strength.If the rules as set up by the Democratic National Committee are to choose a candidate by the total delegate count, and Mr. Obama has essentially a total that cannot be surpassed through regular state primaries and caucuses, I wonder why news coverage continues to treat the race as essentially even, and worse, that Senator Clinton somehow is gaining the upper hand.There are not always two equal sides to a story. In the case of the Democratic contest, it seems that the media are willing to engage in this subtle bias to continue the competitive narrative.Marc SchlossbergEugene, Ore., March 10, 2008"

A law professor commissioned by Austrian Jews found that at least 11 of the foundation&#8217;s works, including some by Egon Schiele (whose &#8220;Liegende Frau&#8221; is above), Anton Romako and Albin Egger-Lienz, belonged to people persecuted by the Nazis and that the collector Rudolf Leopold certainly knew that they might have been looted. &#8220;He knew, or he must have known, that these paintings belonged to people who were persecuted by the Nazis,&#8221; said Georg Graf, the professor. &#8220;Because of that knowledge, he must have been aware of the possibility that these were stolen goods.&#8221; Mr. Leopold, in an interview with Die Presse, disputed the allegation. &#8220;In my eyes, the pictures were acquired lawfully,&#8221; he said. The Austrian culture minister, Claudia Schmied, said at a news conference this week that she expected the foundation to approve an independent examination of its collection. ... The National Gallery in London said its painting &#8220;Cupid Complaining to Venus,&#8221; by the German artist Lucas Cranach the Elder, was once part of Hitler&#8217;s private collection and may have been looted during World War II, The Washington Post reported. A researcher, Birgit Schwartz, spotted the painting &#151; showing Cupid complaining to Venus that he has been stung by bees after stealing honey &#151; in a photograph of Hitler&#8217;s private gallery contained in an album at the Library of Congress in Washington and brought it to the attention of the National Gallery. The museum has been unable to account for the painting&#8217;s ownership or whereabouts from 1909, when it was sold at auction in Berlin, to 1945, when an American war correspondent took it from a warehouse of art guarded by American troops in southern Germany, a National Gallery spokesman said."

2008-03-29T00:00:00Z,"Nine classical artifacts that until recently belonged to the New York philanthropist Shelby White will go on view Saturday at the Palazzo Poli in Rome as part of an exhibition of illicitly excavated antiquities returned to Italy by American museums, dealers and collectors. Among the pieces Ms. White handed over this year after long negotiations are two from the fifth century B.C., a bronze statuette of a nude youth and a calyx-krater attributed to the so-called Eucharides Painter. A 2,500-year-old krater attributed to the Greek master Euphronios will go back to Italy in two years under the agreement Ms. White reached with the Italian Culture Ministry. In a statement issued on Friday by both sides, Ms. White said that her collection had been purchased at public auction from dealers whom she and her husband, Leon Levy, who died in 2003, had &#8220;believed to be reputable.&#8221; She said she had nonetheless concluded, based on Italian government evidence, that &#8220;their export from Italy was questionable.&#8221; The Italian government has never accused Ms. White or Mr. Levy of any wrongdoing, and the joint statement said that Ms. White had &#8220;shown great sensitivity and taken the initiative voluntarily to offer to return 10 items.&#8221; The exhibition at the Palazzo Poli is an expanded version of &#8220;Nostoi: Recovered Masterpieces,&#8221; a show of some 70 pieces recovered mostly from four American museums, which opened in December at the Quirinale, or presidential palace, in Rome."

Most mornings the chairman and C.E.O. of Tod’s Group shuttles by helicopter or private jet from his main home in Casette d’Ete, Italy, to the company headquarters in Milan. Beyond this regular commute, there are frequent jaunts to London and Paris, business trips to Asia and occasional getaways to New York and places like Parrot Cay in Turks and Caicos. So it’s no surprise that Della Valle is obsessed with globes. “I have been a collector for about 50 years,” he says. “All my friends give them to me as presents.” He found this one at Florian Papp, a small antiques shop on Manhattan’s Upper East Side; it’s become a favorite and now has pride of place in his office. “I think I like them so much because I miss traveling for my soul rather than business,” he says. “I’d love to stay for a long time in a small place where the food is fantastic and there are no phones.” Della Valle hopes to hit the road soon, renting a motor home with his son and driving across America, making stops at places like Yellowstone National Park; Jackson Hole, Wyo.; and Palm Springs, Calif. After that, he might head off the beaten path. “Maybe I’ll just spin the globe, put my finger on it and go wherever it lands. That’s the dream.” ARMAND LIMNANDER."

''I try to get out in the woods on a backpacking trip at least once a year. What I do for a living is totally immersed in humanity: there's something I really love about covering assignments and meeting all different kinds of people every day. But to get out where, for all you know, there's nobody within miles is priceless. The whole little mountain lake was surrounded by foothills, and our campsite was right alongside. After dinner, you've got a full belly, and scenery all around you. You watch the final rays of the sun cut across the top of the mountain, not a breeze in the air, the water still, like glass. The only ripples in the lake were these little red salamanders. Once in a while they would bump into each other and thrash around. But that was the only disturbance. It was really, really sweet.''

He graduated Magna Cum Laude from Harvard University where he was also inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. Mr. Maisel's inimitable character was reflected in his career that broadened the audience for many ''hidden gems.'' He wrote Charles T. Griffes: the Life of an American Composer, the first and still influential biography of this major early American composer. Mr. Maisel also produced a CD, The Songs of Charles T. Griffes. In 1986, he produced Griffes' final but unfinished work, Salut au Monde for the Kennedy Center's Terrace Theater. Mr. Maisel was instrumental in shaping thinking about physical fitness. He wrote Tai Chi for Health, the first Western manual of the classic (Yang) form of the Chinese system of meditative exercise. A world traveler, he visited China during the eras of Mao and Deng refining his understanding of Tai Chi. In The Alexander Technique, Mr. Maisel wrote the introduction and edited the writings of F. Mattias Alexander. This book on Alexander's method of body-mind training became widely used as a textbook for actors and dancers. His other books related to fitness include Have Your Baby, Keep Your Figure and Fit to Drive. His article, Should Veterans Have Legs?, about the poor quality of artificial limbs available to WWII veterans helped prompt the government's investigation of prosthesis. He served as director of research at the International Center of the Disabled, director of the American Physical Fitness Research Institute and in Hawaii, where he lived for many years, director of Ka Lima O Maui, a sheltered workshop for the disabled. He was predeceased by his wife, Betty Cage, general manager of the NYC Ballet and by five sisters. He is survived by a brother-in-law Robert O. Swados of Buffalo and many nieces and nephews.

The film studies faculty at Montclair State University mourn the sudden, tragic loss of our beloved friend, Paul Arthur: brilliant scholar, dynamic teacher and generous colleague. We will miss his intellect, integrity, and wit every day. Janet Cutler and Art Simon ARTHUR--Paul. Exuberantly loving father; brilliant, passionate film scholar, critic and teacher; of a mind, body and spirit too capacious to describe in these few column inches, Paul Arthur died March 25 at home, five weeks after he was diagnosed with melanoma. He was 60 years old. With him when he died were his daughters, Jarrett Rachel (25) and Devin Valerie (22); his former wife, Dr. Karen Arthur; his mother, Pearl Fried; and his dog, Monk. He also leaves a sister, Roseanne. Only a year ago, he suffered the loss of his partner, Susan Deul, to breast cancer. Since 1989, Paul had been a professor of English and Film Studies at Montclair State University; he was named the Distinguished Scholar of the University for 2007-2008. He received a B.A. (1969) in English from Tufts University, where he also was on the football team and in SDS, and a Ph.D. (1985) in Cinema Studies from NYU. Coming of age in the 1960s, he was drawn to the political activism of the New Left and the radical modernism of avant-garde film. Both were for him, as he later wrote, ''expressions of resistance and transformation'', and he remained committed to them for life. His writings weave aesthetics and politics in the context of American history and culture. Paul was a contributing editor of Film Comment, associate editor of Cineaste and co-editor of Millennium Film Journal. His book A Line of Sight: American Avant-Garde Film Since 1965 was published by Minnesota Press; at the time of his death, he had nearly completed a collection of his writings on documentary and a book on Nick Broomfield. He embodied contradictions as bold and fascinating as those of the art works he loved. He was both spontaneous and ritualistic in his personal relationships and in his work. He made a journal entry for every film he saw, freely noting his immediate responses and ideas; and he commemorated the death of John Coltrane every July 17 for 40 years. As mentally and physically tough as he was, he took pure pleasure in a good laugh, a great meal, a well-played hockey game, a compelling argument over a movie. The refinement of his senses of sight and sound notwithstanding, he was a thoroughly tactile and physically demonstrative person. His talismanic animal was the bear. The family members, colleagues, students and friends who mourn him echo one another in describing him as larger than life. The hole he leaves in our hearts and the world is too big to be filled."

She received her degree in medicine at Hsiang-Ya Medical College in Hunan, China, and immigrated to the United States in 1948. After completing an internship at St. Barnabas Hospital, residency training in pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and specialty training in oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, she joined our faculty in 1954. Dr. Tan was a pioneer in the field of developmental therapeutics who was the first to explore several cancer drugs in the treatment of malignancies of childhood. Her seminal studies of dactinomycin, and the anthracyclines daunomycin, and adriamycin, and the enzyme l-asparaginase demonstrated their therapeutic potential and led to their introduction into the multidrug regimens which now provide curative treatments for a high proportion of children afflicted with leukemia and cancers of developing bone, muscle and nerve cells. Thereafter, she shepherded initial Phase I trials that identified the safety and activity of several other cancer drugs that are now in standard use in the treatment of childhood malignancies. In addition to her landmark studies in developmental therapeutics, Dr. Tan was also widely recognized for her important contributions in the treatment of children with Hodgkin's disease. Dr. Tan's accomplishments were many and substantive. She authored over 126 papers in her field, worked tirelessly to ensure that the most promising new drugs would be available to children with cancer early in their development and successfully treated hundreds of young patients who are now cured, healthy adults leading productive lives throughout the world.

He also leaves behind a sister, Kathleen Wist Gale, and her husband, David Bernard, of Palmyra, Virginia. A true Renaissance man, Kirby enjoyed reading, traveling, and learning new languages; he also had a love of the land, sea, and air. He is remembered for his unique use of language, his dry and endearing sense of humor, and his compassion. A hobbyist sailor for the last forty years, Kirby was sailing in a charity race outside of the San Francisco Bay with his good friend Anthony Harrow when the ship disappeared in turbulent seas. Kirby was blessed to have a large community of friends who fondly recall his curiosity, intellect, humanity, and humility.

Joseph William (Bill) Stack, Jr. died peacefully at the Health Care Center at Meadow Ridge in Redding, Connecticut on March 25, 2008, at the age of 89. Born and raised in East Lansing, Michigan, where his father was a Professor at Michigan State University, he graduated from Yale University in 1940. There he was Captain of both the freshman and varsity football teams. He served in the Navy during WWII, seeing action at Midway and Guadalcanal before transferring to the European theatre where he took part in D-Day. He rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander and was the first U.S. Naval Officer to enter liberated Paris. After the war, his business career began at General Motors, and culminated in 1970 when he founded his own executive search firm in New York City, William Stack Associates. He ran the firm until his retirement in 1995. Throughout his life he was active in Yale alumni affairs. He served on the Boards of the Yale Alumni Association, the Football Y Association and was a founding member of Lux et Veritas. He was also always active in the Episcopal Church serving on several different Vestries. After his retirement he became a Mentor in the Norwalk, CT school system. He is survived by his beloved wife of 60 years, Wolcott Rorick (Mimi) Stack, and their children and families, Chris, Martha, Nathan, Courtney, Charlotte, David, Sarah, Hadley, Isabel, Will, Peter, Sonya, Joey, Patrick, Mickey and Jamie.

2008-03-30T00:00:00Z,"ON Wednesday, the Ford Motor Company agreed to sell Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors of India. Tata will pay Ford $2.3 billion -- or $200 million less than Ford paid for Jaguar alone in 1989 -- while Ford will contribute $600 million for the Jaguar-Land Rover pension fund. While it may seem a bit late for hand-wringing over the end of the British Empire, the sale of Jaguar to an Indian company must be even more jarring to lovers of classic English brands than the sale of Bentley and Rolls-Royce to the Germans. But any change for Jaguar must be seen as a positive one."

2008-04-01T00:00:00Z,"The political season continues to be very good to CNN, which will officially announce on Tuesday that for the first time since 2001, it managed to beat the Fox News Channel in prime time for one quarter of the year in the category of news viewers most desirable to advertisers, according to Nielsen. Thanks to its debate coverage and heavy focus on the presidential primaries, CNN’s ratings in prime time for viewers 25 to 54 were up 90 percent, to an average of 453,000 for the first quarter of 2008. That was enough to edge past the perennial leader, Fox, which had 438,000 viewers, up 12 percent from last year. MSNBC also had a strong quarter in prime time, growing 68 percent to 329,000 viewers. CNN has done especially well on the nights of contested primaries, winning every night in those ratings except one, the Florida primary on Jan. 29. That was the only night when the Republican race was of higher interest than the Democratic one, and Fox won that night. Among total viewers in prime time, Fox maintained its leadership position in the first quarter with an average of 1.8 million viewers, up 14 percent from last year. CNN grew 67 percent to 1.3 million viewers. MSNBC was up 59 percent to 791,000 viewers."

Mr. Roth, whose last novel was “Exit Ghost” (2007), the ninth and final book about the author’s literary alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, has set the new book during the Korean War. The story follows Marcus Messner, a young man from Newark who is obsessively worried about being drafted into the war. He ends up at a conservative college in Winesburg, Ohio, to escape his overbearing father. “The novel tracks him trying to find his place and fit in and having the tough time of it that he does,” said Becky Saletan, publisher of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt."
2008-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Kathie Lee Gifford, right, the former longtime co-host of “Live With Regis and Kathie Lee,” is returning to morning television as the host of the fourth hour of NBC’s “Today” program, the network confirmed Monday. The feature-heavy fourth hour of “Today,” introduced in September, competes directly against “Live” in some markets, so Ms. Gifford will go up against her former colleague, Regis Philbin, and the woman to whom she ceded her chair in 2000, Kelly Ripa. The assignment, beginning April 7, will be Ms. Gifford’s third morning show stint: she reported for “Good Morning America” before becoming Mr. Philbin’s co-host on “Live” for 15 years. Ms. Gifford was introduced on “Today” by Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira, the hosts of the first two hours. “I’m 8 years older, 10 pounds heavier and a half-inch shorter, just in time for HD television,” Ms. Gifford joked. With seven hosts sitting on the set, the cameras could barely show the entire ensemble. But the addition of Ms. Gifford will reduce the workload for some of the others. Ms. Gifford will join Hoda Kotb, her co-anchor for the fourth hour. Ann Curry and Al Roker, two members of the 7 to 9 a.m. team, will continue as co-hosts of the third hour but will no longer contribute to the fourth. Natalie Morales, who was named a co-anchor of the fourth hour last September, will become a host of the third hour."

According to Nielsen’s overnight estimates, the 23-minute college basketball overrun into the 7 p.m. time slot meant that more than 17 million viewers were tuned in to CBS during the first half-hour of prime time. Directly after the live coverage ended, CBS drew about 12.3 million viewers for “60 Minutes,” followed by an above-average audience of 8 million viewers for CBS’s “Big Brother.” Despite its second place finish, ABC outpaced CBS among adults 18 to 49 thanks to “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition” at 8 (12.8 million) and “Oprah’s Big Give” at 9 (11.3 million). Fox was third for the night in that demographic, trailing both ABC and CBS with its animated comedy lineup. NBC, which drew slightly more total viewers than Fox, finished a distant fourth in the 18-to-49 set. NBC broadcast repeats from 9 to 11, following a special showing of MSNBC’s “Countdown With Keith Olbermann” at 7 (3.4 million) and “Dateline” at 8 (6.7 million)."

The feature-heavy fourth hour of ''Today,'' introduced in September, competes directly against ''Live'' in some markets, so Ms. Gifford will go up against her former colleague, Regis Philbin, and the woman to whom she ceded her chair in 2000, Kelly Ripa. The assignment, beginning April 7, will be Ms. Gifford's third morning show stint: she reported for ''Good Morning America'' before becoming Mr. Philbin's co-host on ''Live'' for 15 years. Ms. Gifford was introduced on ''Today'' by Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira, the hosts of the first two hours. ''I'm 8 years older, 10 pounds heavier and a half-inch shorter, just in time for HD television,'' Ms. Gifford joked. With seven hosts sitting on the set, the cameras could barely show the entire ensemble. But the addition of Ms. Gifford will reduce the workload for some of the others. Ms. Gifford will join Hoda Kotb, her co-anchor for the fourth hour. Ann Curry and Al Roker, two members of the 7 to 9 a.m. team, will continue as co-hosts of the third hour but will no longer contribute to the fourth.

2008-04-01T00:00:00Z,"The nation's tuberculosis rate dropped last year to its lowest level since national reporting of the rate began in 1953. But the decline is slowing, and that troubles Dr. Heather Menzies, an officer of the Epidemic Intelligence Service of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ''It means we have to have a sustained effort to continue our progress,'' she said. ''There's a perception that TB is a disease of the past, but it continues to exact a severe toll on many U.S. communities.'' More than half the cases are among the foreign-born, which, Dr. Menzies said, ''speaks to the fact that this is a global epidemic.'' She added that the C.D.C. has begun a study of diagnosis, prevention and treatment among African-Americans, whose rates are eight times as high as those of whites. There was a slight decline in drug-resistant tuberculosis cases in 2007, but Dr. Menzies regards it as insignificant. ''In recent years,'' she said, ''the proportion has been about 1 percent, and I would describe it as stable."

2008-04-02T00:00:00Z,"When it comes to publicity, being denied entry into the United States may be the best thing that ever happened to Sebastian Horsley, right, unless you count being hung on a cross in the Philippines. Mr. Horsley, the British author of “Dandy in the Underworld” (Harper Perennial) — a rollicking memoir of his rampant drug use, abundant encounters with prostitutes and that trip to the Philippines to be crucified for an art exhibition — was turned back at Newark Liberty International Airport last month on the grounds of “moral turpitude.” He was here for a book party and media tour. Now PEN American Center, the writers’ organization, has invited Mr. Horsley to speak at its annual festival of international literature at the end of this month and written a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, asking them to admit Mr. Horsley to the country. Francine Prose, president of PEN American Center, said that Mr. Horsley was not originally invited as a speaker, but that his deportation made him a cause célèbre. “PEN supports freedom of speech and freedom of expression on the most basic level,” she said. “Writers should be able to enter our country regardless of what they’ve written.” Mr. Horsley, in a telephone interview from London, said he would “absolutely” accept PEN’s invitation if American authorities would let him into the country. “The pen is mightier than the sword,” he said. “And it’s considerably easier to write with.” So far his book has sold only a thousand copies in the United States, according to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 70 percent of retail sales."

Although ABC averaged more total viewers, CBS, the runner-up, edged ahead among adults 18 to 49, thanks to its popular half-hour sitcoms, including “Two and a Half Men” at 9 p.m. (14.4 million), which led the night among the 18-to-49 set. CBS also dominated the 10 p.m. time slot with “CSI: Miami” (15.5 million), easily outpacing both NBC’s “Medium” (9.5 million) and the last hour of ABC’s “Bachelor,” which averaged just over 8 million viewers from 9:36 to 11 p.m. NBC ranked third for the night, delivering its largest audience at 9 with “Deal or No Deal” (10 million) but struggling at 8 with “My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad” (4.4 million). Fox, fourth in total viewers, tied NBC for third among adults 18 to 49, broadcasting a repeat of “House” at 8 (7.5 million) followed by “New Amsterdam” at 9 (6.6 million). On Saturday night Nickelodeon’s “Kids’ Choice Awards,” with Jack Black as host and a performance by Miley Cyrus, drew 7.4 million viewers, the cable channel said on Tuesday.

(One of the recovered works is above.) Six of the paintings taken from the Northern Territory Museum and Gallery exemplified the early work of the Papunya Tula movement. Named for an artists’ collective in central Australia, it is credited with being the first to paint aboriginal tribal motifs on board or canvas, creating a style in the 1970s that became world-renowned. The police said a blood-spattered broken window, security footage and other clues indicated that the thief had smashed into the museum with a rock and spent 15 minutes inside while alarms sounded. The paintings were found in parkland. A 37-year-old man was detained and questioned."

2008-04-02T00:00:00Z,"Sovereign wealth funds have emerged in recent months as the world's power brokers. They have used their tremendous wealth to make big cross-border investments and prop up some of Wall Street's best-firms. The increased activity comes as other kinds of acquirers have been sidelined by the credit crisis. These funds are state-sponsored investment vehicles and have combined assets of $2 trillion. With that much dry powder, sovereign funds dwarf the formerly booming private equity industry -- and in some cases, compete directly with it. The Investment Government of Singapore Corporation has been the most active among the world's sovereign funds, making its deputy chairman, Tony Tan, a major center of gravity. Wall Street veterans always follow the money, so many of the big-name advisers in New York and London have found themselves traveling the globe playing international matchmaker to these funds. But sovereign funds have also learned the downside of deal-making: some of their blockbuster transactions have been big money losers so far. The question is where all that money will go next."

2008-04-03T00:00:00Z,"Sotheby’s said on Wednesday that it would postpone the sale of an early photographic print known as a photogenic drawing because some scholars now believe that the print — an image of a leaf — may have been produced much earlier than previously thought, making it the earliest existing photographic image. For many years the image was attributed to William Henry Fox Talbot, one of the fathers of photography, and was thought to have been made in 1839. But Larry J. Schaaf, an expert on Talbot’s work, questioned that attribution in an essay in the catalog for the photography auction, which will still be held on Monday but without the leaf image, above. Mr. Schaaf wrote that there is evidence to suggest that the work titled “Leaf” — made by placing a leaf on photosensitive paper exposed to light — could have been created by the early photographic experimenters Thomas Wedgwood, James Watt or Humphry Davy. They are known to have produced photogenic drawings, also called photograms, as early as the 1790s, though no examples have ever been found. Denise Bethel, director of Sotheby’s photograph department, said the auction house and the image’s owner, an investment firm called the Quillan Company, had decided to postpone the sale of the print indefinitely until more research could be done."

Also, the film was released in 1964 -- not 1963 -- as an accompanying picture caption correctly noted. In the film ''Panic in the Streets,'' the epidemic confronting a public-health doctor played by Mr. Widmark was pneumonic, not bubonic, plague. In ''Kiss of Death,'' the character played by Mildred Dunnock, who is bound to her wheelchair and pushed down a flight of stairs by an ex-convict played by Mr. Widmark, is the mother of an underworld informer -- not the mother of an informer played by Victor Mature.

Theodore Hesburgh, then the president of Notre Dame, asked how his university could get the reputation for scholarship that Princeton had. The remark was made early in Father Hesburgh&#8217;s 35-year tenure as president, which began in 1952; it was not made in 1987 (The Times reported the remark in an article that year).

After he graduated from Columbus High School in the Bronx, Joe attended the New York Maritime Academy at Fort Schuyler, graduating with a B.S. in Engineering. He served as First Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force, responsible for managing delivery of supplies to U.S. troops stationed in Europe and serving as a navigator in Strategic Air Command (SAC), before retiring into civilian life. Joe worked briefly at Gatti & Lopez, a family business, then entered the financial world as a stock broker for Merrill Lynch in 1963. Over the next 45 years, he held management positions at many of the top investment banks and financial companies in New York, including Merrill Lynch, Hornblower, Weeks, Hemphill & Noyes (where he was their youngest partner), Oppenheimer, Inc., and most recently Spencer Trask, Inc. Much of his work had to do with finding investors for new technologies and new products. Joe's first love was his family. He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Anne Hawkins Gatti, his daughters, Madeline Gatti, Barbara Gatti Mayer, Ph.D., and Elizabeth Gatti; their spouses, Steven Tappen, James Mayer, M.D., and Ken Larson, respectively; his three grandchildren, Morgan Paige Mayer, Ursula Larson, and Vincent Larson; and his brother John George Gatti, his sister Sr. Patricia Gatti, and many friends.

''Synesthesia,'' a work conceived and produced by Electric Pear Productions, a two-year-old multimedia theater group, is based on that childhood game. For the second year, Melanie Sylvan and Ashlin Halfnight, founders of Electric Pear, have brought together a dozen artists from various genres, including theater, music, dance, art, comedy and spoken word. Over five and a half months, each had two weeks to create a work based on the preceding artist's piece. The jumping-off point for the entire process was a message in a fortune cookie: ''New people will bring you new realizations, especially about big issues.'' That sentence was turned into a 10-minute short by the filmmaker Gregory Stuart Edwards, who handed it over to the writer Damian Lanigan, who created a monologue based on it, which went to the photographer Peter Hapak, and so on."

2008-04-04T00:00:00Z,"'PIGS, BEARS AND BILLY GOATS GRUFF' To children a kitchen is much more than a place for cooking and eating. Forks and spoons double as percussion instruments; pans serve as warriors' helmets; a tabletop is a cottage roof. Where grown-ups see only mealtime, the young see playtime. But the adults of the Patch Theater Company have no such limited vision. Now presenting ''Pigs, Bears and Billy Goats Gruff,'' an adaptation of four traditional tales at the New Victory Theater, this Australian troupe performs on a set that is essentially a kitchen, with a plain table and chairs, French doors and a big metal pot on the shelf. But it doesn't stay a kitchen for long. The chairs stand in as houses in ''The Three Little Pigs''; the table becomes the planks of an old bridge in ''The Three Billy Goats Gruff''; the gleaming pot is transformed into a queen's crown in ''The Three Feathers.'' (Conveniently, these objects also play themselves in ''Goldilocks and the Three Bears.'') The show may not have the production values of its neighbor ''The Lion King,'' but it too creates a world of animals, some good, some not, whose fortunes unfold across savannas created only in the imagination."

Stravinsky's score is performed in the fittingly delicate two-piano version by the Russian identical twins Julia and Irina Elkina; they begin the show with his Sonata for Two Pianos. Normally, of course, the hero, Petrushka, is played by a person; half the fun is in seeing how this dancer morphs into a puppet, albeit one who yearns to experience the richness of human emotion. What's wondrous about Mr. Twist's art (and especially poignant, given the subject matter) is to see how marvelously real his Petrushka is, along with his rival, the Moor, and the object of his ardor, the Ballerina (above, with Petrushka)."

Most places stand out in an obvious way and sit on one of the few streets in town. It is, however, a good idea to call ahead; posted hours are sometimes more goal than reality. If you use Green Valley as a base, there is a Holiday Inn Express (520-625-0900) at Exit 69 off Interstate 19, as well as a Best Western (520-625-2250) and a Baymont Inns and Suites (520-399-3736) at Exit 65.

Thompson during an all-night psychedelic drug binge. In colorful digital photographs printed on canvas, partly overpainted and presented within wide, wooden frames elaborately decorated to resemble Indonesian tourist kitsch, Mr. Bickerton stars as a decadent Ugly American living in a South Pacific paradise. (He actually lives in Bali.) His skin is painted Blue Man Group blue, and he is accompanied by voluptuous female islanders whose partly nude bodies are painted in tropical hues. In various scenes he boozes, smokes pot and poses in a sarong in a garish family portrait with a native consort and two children. One especially lively piece, ''The Dream,'' right, has him howling in bed with a bright red demon squatting on his chest, and green snakes writhing about, each with a screaming head that's a small version of Mr. Bickerton's own."

2008-04-06T13:44:15Z,"More campaign-related opinion for Sunday, April 6:"
2008-04-06T13:24:47Z,"A scratchy-voiced Joe Girardi said he would return to the dugout on Sunday and manage the Yankees. Girardi did not manage the Yankees in the last two games because he had an upper respiratory infection. ""It's the worst I've ever felt for a two-day period,"" Girardi said. While Girardi felt strong enough to manage, he cancelled the first ""Joe Girardi Show."" Girardi was supposed to tape the show on Sunday morning for airing on the YES Network after the game, but he decided against doing it. ""I didn't think it was in my health's best interest to try and do a half hour show and be coughing all the time,"" Girardi said. As Girardi quarantined himself off in his office at Yankee Stadium, Rob Thomson, the bench coach, managed the Yankees to two losses. Girardi said that he communicated with Thomson during games, but hated sitting in the dugout and managing. ""It was hard,"" Girardi said. ""You feel bored. You feel somewhat worthless."""
2008-04-06T13:13:47Z,"For six days and 23½ hours, the auxiliary locker room at Yankee Stadium is exactly that. It is on the lowest level of the Stadium, between the home and the visiting clubhouse. It is the place where the Yankees stage some press conferences, like Manager Joe Girardi's pregame and postgame sessions. But when the Yankees play at home, a Catholic Mass is held in the locker room from 10 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. on Sundays. The first Mass of the season was held on Sunday. The service is attended by stadium employees, police officers, reporters and, sometimes, visiting players and team executives. I have seen Brian Cashman, the general manager of the Yankees, there. Bob Sheppard, the Yankees' public address announcer since 1951, often does the Scripture readings, which, on its own, is a reason to attend the Mass. Sheppard is still recuperating, but there was an announcement made during the service about how he hopes to return by June. The Mass is quick because most attendees are working, but, for those whose Sundays feel vacant without a spiritual experience, it is enjoyable. A half hour after the Mass was over, the makeshift altar was gone and Girardi was doing his pregame news conference. The next Mass at the Stadium will be much different. It will be celebrated by Pope Benedict XVI in two weeks and will attract more than 50,000 worshipers."

''I came to Austin for art school and bought this property in 1994. This part of the courtyard is facing the apartment I built. When I first moved in I'd have parties -- artists would come and cover these walls in sgraffito. In the backyard is a stand-alone kitchen and porch, a big pole barn that I use as a studio with a residence above it. There are also three trailers on the property, so there are about five full-time residents here. I've always imagined having a compound filled with people -- not a family with kids but a group of like-minded individuals. This was a typical day for us -- some friends over, hanging out, drinking beer, doing whatever.' Camille Sweeney"

2008-04-06T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In reading ''On the Lam with Kesey'' (March 23) about Lawrence Downes's mostly fruitless search for signs of Kesey in Manzanillo from more than 40 years ago, I found myself wondering if he had thought of taking his quest to San Miguel de Allende. True, Kesey had returned to the United States by the time I dropped out in '67, but Neal Cassady and friends were well established in this town of expatriate artists and potheads. Neal was the featured guest at most parties, entertaining us all with his perpetual-motion silver hammer act and dazzling us with his washboard abs. (He was always bare-chested, regardless of the temperature!) We'd all read Kerouac and Burroughs, but few of us knew that Cassady, too, was something of a poet. By the time I met him, drugs and booze had taken their toll. In 1968, he was found dead on the railroad tracks outside of town. At least, that was the story that made the rounds of our hippie community. Thanks for the memories. Linda Martin Port Townsend, Wash."

2008-04-06T00:00:00Z,"ONCE, in the late 1970s, Norma Kamali bought gray fleece to make a swimsuit cover-up, then proceeded to make an entire collection out of it: blazers, rah-rah skirts. ''I was like, 'Oh, my God. Let's do an evening gown!' '' she recalled. But her novel idea of ''sweatshirt dressing,'' which preceded the '80s fitness craze, proved immensely influential, cropping up through the years in collections from Vivienne Westwood, Martin Margiela and Calvin Klein. (It also earned her the unfortunate title ''Queen of Sweats.'') This season, Stefano Pilati of Yves Saint Laurent took a stab at it. The result was a collection so strong it made the idea of reworking the comfortable, inexpensive fabric in clever, elegant ways seem absolutely right again. He used gray fleece to construct an impeccably tailored jacket, trousers and one covetable nipped-waist cocktail dress. He also proved that with proper styling, the mundane sweatshirt can indeed look chic."

''Every day we enjoyed the warm sea and the sun from morning until sunset -- this is something we cannot experience where we come from. The kids had just discovered the small fish in the sea, and you can maybe see that they have made a big shark in the sand. When it was dark that night, we went back to the beach to feed the small fish with some bread. It is interesting that this picture was taken in the twilight, because all of our children carry Icelandic names related to the daylight and darkness: Birta means bright, Logi means flame, and Rokkvi means dark. The picture reminds us how full of life our kids are, how much fun it was to play with them on the beach, even though everyone else had left, and the sun almost had set.

2008-04-06T00:00:00Z,"ZOOM Critics argue that the use of re-enactments in documentaries suggests a callous disregard on the part of a filmmaker for what is true. I don't agree. Some re-enactments serve the truth, others subvert it. There is no mode of expression, no technique of production that will instantly produce truth or falsehood. There is no veritas lens that provides a ''truthful'' picture of events. There is cinéma vérité and kino pravda but no cinematic truth. The engine of uncovering truth is not some special lens or even the unadorned human eye; it is unadorned human reason. It wasn't a cinéma vérité documentary [''The Thin Blue Line''] that got Randall Dale Adams out of prison. It was a film that re-enacted important details of the crime. It was an investigation -- part of which was done with a camera. The re-enactments capture the important details of that investigation. It's not re-enactments per se that are wrong or inappropriate. It's the use of them. I use re-enactments to burrow underneath the surface of reality in an attempt to uncover some hidden truth. ..."

A public education activist and active member of the American Association of University Women and the Women's City Club, as well as the China Institute, she went peacefully, without pain. Born April 18, 1928 in Chicago, Illinois, she was the daughter of artist Alexander Raymond Katz and Elsie Katz. A graduate of the University of Michigan, she was the editor of the Michigan Daily when, as the story goes, it was the first newspaper to correctly report Truman's victory over Dewey. The widow of architect Leonard Jacobson, she leaves behind a brother, Donald Katz, sons Eric and Dan, and grandchildren Cody, Ivan, Odessa, Cezar and Alex.

2008-04-06T00:00:00Z,"THE shrapnel from the subprime explosion continues to scatter. Lenders are experiencing a surge in losses from mortgage fraud, according to recent reports from law enforcement agencies and industry research groups. The ripples are reaching borrowers in new ways, as mortgage banks seek to stanch the flow of dollars to con artists. ''It's looking like a record-breaking year already,'' said Stephen Kodak, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which fields fraud complaints from federally chartered financial institutions. Mr. Kodak said that in first half of the 2008 fiscal year, which ended last month, the F.B.I. received nearly 30,000 ''suspicious activity reports.'' The 2007 fiscal year ended with 46,000 reports and 260 convictions."
2008-04-06T00:00:00Z,"There is an American rite of passage that for most of us comes well after our first car, first love or first steady job: buying a first home. Most of the news about homeownership these days is decidedly grim -- foreclosures spreading, adjustable-rate mortgages rising, values falling. But for the people on these pages, homeownership still brings with it some joy, if also, in some cases, sizable mortgages and little equity. In this country, the median age for a first-time home buyer in 2006 was 32, by which time many people have married, started having children and perhaps managed to save up for a down payment. The first-time home buyers on these pages -- some of them with their dependents, extended family, cats and dogs -- all recently shared in that rite of passage, closing on their first home in the past 24 months, at the age of 32. Their paths to homeownership were varied: some were all-consuming quests; others almost happenstance. Their homes, too, differ, ranging from a fixer-upper in Portland, Ore., which cost $195,150, to a brand-new luxury condo on Manhattan's Upper West Side that cost more than four times as much. But one thing holds true for these buyers: If this first home is not the one they always dreamed of -- not the ideal size or layout, location or price -- it is still one they are proud to call their own. Names: Tessa Brady, 33, a hairstylist at Mark's Barbershop, and her sons, Sebastian, 7, and Silas, 5. Location: Oregon, Wis. Home: A 1,725-square-foot duplex with three bedrooms and an attached garage. Cost: The house is valued at $160,000; it was built by the nonprofit organization Habitat for Humanity. Financing: $500 down payment (from savings); 350 hours of sweat-equity work; 30-year no-interest mortgage for $78,000; two mortgages for $22,000 and $56,000 that will be repaid only if she sells the house. Favorite feature: The living room. Least favorite feature: The basement is unfinished."

''We took the bones of that house and just tricked it out,'' Gage explains of the surfaces, materials and finishes meticulously rendered for this story. ''It's kind of like 'Pimp My Ride. '' To accurately simulate elements like the 18-karat-gold chandelier or the titanium staircase took countless hours, not to mention the brain power of a massive bank of computers in Paris. ''Making a solid titanium staircase this way sets you back a couple of days' work,'' Gage says. ''If you were to do it in real life, it would cost you millions of dollars -- but worth every penny!''

Born in Havana, Cuba on May 4, 1922, eldest son of the late Dr. Jose A.G. Ordonez and Gloria Montalvo, he is survived by his brothers, Raoul and Carlos, both of Miami, and numerous nieces and nephews. Educated at Ridley College, Canada, he served with the Canadian Third Division in Europe in the latter stages of WWII. Thereafter, he graduated with Honors from Trinity College at the University of Toronto, where, in 1964, he also obtained a MA in History. In 1952 he began his long career as a Master and History teacher at St. Paul's School (SPS), Concord, NH. Concentrating on European History, his classes were taught with flair and humor, his Victorian History course being among the most remembered. In addition he introduced Cross Country to the School as a recognized sport and founded the Shavian Society, dedicated to the study of the works of George Bernard Shaw. For the 1977-78 academic year, he was a visiting teacher at Eton College, England an experience which much enriched his teaching career. In 1991 he complied and edited ''St. Paul's School, a Pictorial History'' and in 1998 his memoir, ''The Education of a Schoolmaster: My Years at St. Pauls School'' was published to considerable acclaim. A vigorous outdoorsman and traveler, he enjoyed, cross-country skiing, running, hiking and biking and took delight and comfort in being in the natural world. His annual train journeys in England and Scotland achieved epic proportions. In his retirement years, he was a frequent visitor to the Adirondacks. Devoted to his students, he made a concerted effort to stay in touch with them and their families as their lives evolved, teaching numerous sons and daughters of his earlier pupils. His retirement dinner in 1987 was attended by over 250 guests, testimony to the affection and esteem in which he was held by generations of SPS students. Following his retirement, he remained in Concord working as an archival consultant for SPS for many years, until moving to Florida to be near his family. Funeral services were private. Gifts in his memory may be made to: The Ordonez Library Fund, St. Paul's School, 325 Pleasant Street, Concord, NH 0330l or to the Adirondack Nature Conservancy, P.O. Box 65, Keene Valley, NY 12943."

A horse-drawn carriage took us to the Breithorn Hotel, third class but comfortable, where we had a dinner that included boiled tongue. A walk took us up into a meadow where we watched elderly women, wearing heavy boots and, on their heads, kerchiefs, pitching hay in the fields. My diary entry ended with the words ''so quiet, peaceful.'' Were I to be there once more, I suspect I might not recognize what I referred to then as a very quaint Heidi-land.

That is the challenge faced by Al Gore, who this year donated his $750,000 Nobel Peace Prize award (and personal matching funds) to the Alliance for Climate Protection, a nonprofit advocacy group he founded to prevent further global warming. To create a promotional campaign, which started last week, Mr. Gore commissioned the Martin Agency, a Richmond, Va., advertising firm known for its clever campaigns for Geico insurance. It asked Brian Collins, whose strategic branding firm in New York -- Collins: -- created the identity and overall design program for the campaign. Here is the logo, which is the centerpiece of the campaign. A logo is routinely the most difficult component to design because it is so important, and usually the client wants to be closely involved. An effective logo is a kind of calculus, the sum of disparate parts that adds up to a memorable image or icon. In this case, the logo is something of a risk because it is neither the name nor initials of the organization but a visual pun on the words We and Me."

Since then, oil has risen and fallen and risen again. On Friday, it was $106 a barrel. The effect of such turbulence on public confidence (as well as on prices at the pump) has prompted increased interest in oil trading. And, perhaps because they are more photogenic than numbers on a screen, the oil traders themselves, whose bizarre gesticulations (known as ''open outcry'' trading) have become a metonym for the market. Some suggest that open outcry -- trading via shouts and hand signals -- is a dying art, threatened by electronic systems. Yet Raymond Carbone, who trades energy options on the New York exchange, is sanguine: ''People have been saying that these signals will only be around for another couple of years. But they've been saying that for a decade.'' And, he notes, ''I can signal a trade faster than you can type it.''"

The salute continues with two of Mr. King's own films: ''Memory for Max, Claire, Ida and Company,'' at 6:30, in which he looks at the effects of aging among residents of the Baycrest Center for Geriatric Care in Toronto, and ''Dying at Grace,'' at 8:30, in which he visits the Salvation Army Toronto Grace Health Center to capture the final days of five terminally ill patients."

Always enlivened by competition, his business thrived throughout the years and he finished every workday with a game of squash. Mr. Rambach was as comfortable surrounded by paintings by Marsden Hartley, Joseph Stella, and Georgia O'Keeffe, as he was in his trailer-office beside his Newark, NJ warehouse, and would have chosen a Nathan's hot dog over lunch at the 21 Club any day. A veteran of WWII, he lied about his age to qualify to join the U.S. Navy in 1942 and fought in the Pacific, though he would say he mostly mopped the decks. Dapper, and a little showy, he favored bow ties and hats, and had a beautiful voice that he used most often to sing Sinatra songs. He read widely and travelled all his life, always for the greater acquisition of knowledge in art and culture, history, politics and nature. And in good times and bad, he made others laugh. His humor, both clever and bawdy, was his most enduring gift. He treasured his wife, Francoise Rambach who survives him. He also leaves his sister and brother-in-law, Frances and Howard Gaynes, his niece and nephew, his three daughters from his first marriage, Wendy Moore of Snowmass, CO, Janet Solomon of Carmichael, CA, Peggy Rambach of Andover, MA, his sons-in-law, Peter Moore and Jason Solomon, and his seven grandchildren and greatgrandchild.

2008-04-08T00:00:00Z,"On the lowest-rated Sunday for the five broadcast television networks since Christmas Eve 2006, ABC and CBS finished in a tie for first place over all. According to Nielsen’s estimates, ABC got a lift as usual from “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition” and “Oprah’s Big Give,” which drew 9.9 million and 9.4 million viewers, respectively, at 8 and 9 p.m. The two shows, along with ABC’s “Here Come the Newlyweds” at 10 (7.7 million), delivered the night’s top ratings among adults 18 to 49; but they trailed CBS’s 9 p.m. drama “Cold Case” for the largest audience over all (11.8 million). CBS, despite matching ABC in total viewers, finished third in the 18-to-49 set behind both ABC and Fox, which broadcast mostly repeats. NBC ranked a distant fourth for the night in that demographic, attracting just 5.7 million and 4 million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m. with back-to-back debuts of two USA Network cable series, “Monk” and “Psych.”."

On Tuesday the network is expected to announce a collaboration with two Oscar-nominated filmmakers for a one-hour report titled “The Lord’s Boot Camp.” Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, the producers of the acclaimed 2006 documentary “Jesus Camp,” gained access to an evangelical camp in Florida last year and followed three teenage girls. The resulting report will be shown on Saturday at 8 p.m., Eastern and Pacific times, on CBS. Susan Zirinsky, the executive producer of “48 Hours,” said she hoped the project would open the door to future collaborations with filmmakers. “We love the crime genre, but this is another interesting way to expand our base,” she said."

The exhumations, above, conducted from August to October, removed 67 skeletons from the desert soil around Fort Craig — 39 men, 2 women and 26 children, according to two federal archaeologists who helped with the dig. They also found scores of empty graves and determined that 20 had been looted. The government kept its exhumation of the unmarked cemetery near the historic fort out of the public’s eye for months to prevent more thefts. The investigation began with a tip about an amateur historian who had displayed the mummified remains of a black soldier, draped in a Civil War-era uniform, in his house. Investigators say the historian, Dee Brecheisen, may have been a prolific looter who spotted historical sites from his plane. Mr. Brecheisen died in 2004, and although it was not clear whether the looting continued after his death, the authorities exhumed the unprotected site to prevent future thefts. The remains are being studied by Bureau of Reclamation scientists, who are piecing together information on their identities. They will be reburied at other national cemeteries."

2008-04-09T00:00:00Z,"It wasn't enough, apparently, for Zora Neale Hurston to write a great American novel and to blaze trails for black women as a scholar and an artist. In ''Zora Neale Hurston: Jump at the Sun,'' an ''American Masters'' documentary on Wednesday night on PBS, we learn that she also pioneered a very 21st-century genre: the unreliable memoir. In her speeches and writings -- including her autobiography, ''Dust Tracks on a Road,'' which is liberally quoted by the film's narrator, S. Epatha Merkerson -- Hurston shaved a decade from her age and substituted the all-black town of Eatonville, Fla., where she grew up, for her actual birthplace in Alabama. The film doesn't speculate about her reasons, but we can: perhaps when being a black woman in the Jim Crow South means that you finish high school at 27 and don't become the first black graduate of Barnard College (with a bachelor's degree in anthropology) until 36, you find it practical to obscure your age."
2008-04-09T00:00:00Z,"Drenched in emotion and suffused with good intentions, ''Body of War'' is impossible not to like, but difficult to admire. Produced and directed by Ellen Spiro and Phil Donahue (yes, that Phil Donahue), the movie uses the wrenching story of one American soldier to mount an angry if unfocused jeremiad against the war in Iraq. In March 2004, Tomas Young, a 24-year-old new Army enlistee from Kansas City, Mo., arrived in Iraq. Almost immediately he was in the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (''Home of Warrior Care,'' as its Web site puts it), on the unfathomably difficult mend from a bullet that left him paralyzed from the chest down. This, then, is the body of war of the movie's title, a body ravaged by physical and psychological wounds, a body hunched and writhing in pain. Over the course of the movie, you become extraordinarily acquainted with this body, which Mr. Young offers up to the camera -- to us -- with remarkable intimacy and trust, largely as a cautionary example, though also because this body is itself damning evidence against the war."

When the State Legislature approved the $122 billion budget on Wednesday, it authorized spending $6 billion more than was spent on last year’s budget. But much to the annoyance of the state’s judicial branch, none of that $6 billion was set aside for judicial raises. Because it has been so long since the state’s judges received a pay increase, the issue has resurfaced repeatedly in budget negotiations. Judges are currently paid $136,700 a year; a 2007 proposal called for a 21 percent raise to $165,200."

Cooperman rejected the defense motions Thursday afternoon. The motions are standard in any criminal trial, when the defense, after the prosecution has presented its case, argues that the charges should be dismissed.

2008-04-10T00:00:00Z,"An alarming outbreak of the mumps two years ago has raised questions about whether an additional vaccination is needed. A report in The New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday tracks the 2006 epidemic, the largest outbreak in two decades. Mumps had virtually disappeared in America since the 1990s, when doctors began using a second dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine among schoolchildren. But most of those who became infected in 2006 were college students who had received the double-vaccination, raising questions about whether a third dose may be needed. The outbreak appeared to start in January 2006 on college campuses in Iowa, and by April the outbreak peaked with 40 states reporting 2,786 cases. By the end of the year, a total of 6,584 cases and 85 hospitalizations had been reported. The researchers noted that the virus probably came from students or other travelers from Britain, where there was a larger outbreak of the same strain. Above, Mandi McClue, got a mumps immunization in 2006 at the health center at Drake University in Des Moines."

Among the original features Pixar is attempting are “Newt,” a summer 2011 film about a lizard cooling his heels in a community college science lab; “The Bear and the Bow,” a holiday 2011 fantasy about an impetuous Scottish princess; and “King of the Elves,” a 2012 offering focusing on elves and trolls living in modern-day Mississippi."

Peter R. Stern, the lawyer for the prints’ owner, Bob Langmuir, a Philadelphia book dealer and collector, said the auction house told him that a private sale of the photos — estimated to be worth up to several hundred thousand dollars — was still a possibility. Phillips officials have not returned calls seeking an explanation for the cancellation of the auction, which was to be held on Tuesday. The photographs, from the late 1950s, show performers at Hubert’s Dime Museum and Flea Circus, a basement freak show on 42nd Street in Manhattan, where Arbus honed her stark signature style. Mr. Langmuir was sued in federal court in Brooklyn by another collector, Bayo Ogunsanya, who claimed he was unaware of the value of the photographs when he sold them to Mr. Langmuir for $3,500 in 2003.

Born March 25, 1988 in Brooklyn, New York, she lived in Bernardsville, New Jersey, since 1999. Melissa, who was born with Down Syndrome, lived a full and extraordinary life. She was a strong and optimistic young woman and was an inspiration to everyone who had the opportunity to know her. In May 2003, Melissa received the Self Advocate Award from The National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS) at their annual spring luncheon in Manhattan, which also honored Senator Hillary Rodham-Clinton. A graduate of Bernards High School, Class of 2007, Melissa was crowned Prom Queen at her senior prom. She was employed by Somerset Hills YMCA in Basking Ridge, where she was an office worker. Melissa had plans to enter a post secondary program so that she could become a counselor at the YMCA. She loved to read and listen to music and she loved to write. A poet and a songwriter, Melissa was taking voice, drama, and dance lessons and aspired to become a singer one day. Some of Melissa's songs were recorded by acclaimed singer/ songwriter Rachel Fuller. Melissa is also survived by her paternal grandmother, Lena Riggio, of Brooklyn, New York and many aunts, uncles and cousins.

2008-04-10T00:00:00Z,"FOR outdoorsy parents who have been cooped up with their children all winter, the light at the end of the Gymboree tunnel is here. Camping season is just around the corner. And a new generation of portable, durable baby cribs makes it easier than ever to enact fantasies of campfires and crystal-clear constellations, even with the tiniest of tent-dwellers. In the past, families had to fumble with fussy play yards when taking babies camping, said Scott Graham, the author of the 2006 book ''Extreme Kids'' (Wilderness Press). ''There was no such thing as lightweight,'' he said. But in the last two years a few manufacturers have stripped portable cribs to the traveling essentials, with features like mosquito netting, UV protection and slim storage profiles. Weighing less than most tots, they can be used as containment devices for newborns and as sleeping areas (for daytime naps and nights inside a tent) for both infants and toddlers. ''They're also stylish enough to use indoors,'' Mr. Graham said, ''even among cool single friends.'' David and Erin Hughes of Durango, Colo., who regularly hike and raft, tested five models on a camping trip in southern Utah with their four children: Sophie, 7; Jed, 4; Truman, 2; and Jonas, 6 months. ''Kudos to all the makers for their ingenuity and craftsmanship,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''Where were these when we were starting out?'' SARAH TUFF"

Ms. Hahn has been touring with Josh Ritter, an indie folk singer-songwriter whose romantic songs and intelligent lyrics are vibrantly illuminated by his earthy, unaffected voice.

2008-04-11T00:00:00Z,"BOSSABRASIL FESTIVAL Jazz and Brazilian music have a history far deeper and more complicated than popular perceptions would suggest. The legacy of jazz-inflected bossa nova, as epitomized by the ageless 1964 album ''Getz/Gilberto,'' has often eclipsed myriad other options: Brazilian jazz with a sharper thrust, a fuller sound, a flashier application of technique. Next week's second annual BossaBrasil Festival, produced by Pat Philips and Ettore Stratta, is likely to encompass this broader range of styles, even as it flirts with a familiar brand of lyricism. The festival, really a high-profile club engagement, features two celebrated artists from Brazil: the pianist and composer Cesar Camargo Mariano, above, and the guitarist and singer João Bosco. Both are dynamic, charismatic performers with a healthy regard for jazz harmony. Both have applied a crossover sensibility to the art of improvisation, delving into funk-based fusion as well as rhapsodic classicism. And both have been crucially involved in bossa nova, working closely and consequentially in the 1970s with the legendary singer Elis Regina. (Mr. Mariano was Ms. Regina's second husband; their daughter, who goes by Maria Rita, has enjoyed great success as a singer herself.)"

2008-04-11T00:00:00Z,"'TOMU UCHIDA: DISCOVERING A JAPANESE MASTER' Like its American counterpart, classical Japanese cinema is turning out to be richer than anyone imagined, continuing to yield discoveries as critics and scholars dig into its depths. The director of some 50 features, Tomu Uchida was barely known outside of Japan until recent film festival retrospectives in Tokyo and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, refocused attention on his work, a highly varied body that extends from left-leaning social films in the 1920s and '30s to experimental dramas and stylized genre pieces in the '50s and '60s. BAMcinématek's 11-film series, which begins on Friday, offers an intriguing sample of Uchida's work, ranging from one of his few surviving silent films (''Policeman,'' from 1933, screening on April 29) up to the audacious ''Fugitive From the Past'' (1964, screening on Sunday), a crime film structured in three acts of roughly one hour each, tracing the ramifications of a murder committed in 1946 through its final tragic convulsions 10 years later."

We are zoned for Public School 117 in Briarwood, Queens, and would like to enroll our son there for kindergarten. --A. B. A Kindergarten registration is currently being conducted for children born in 2003 who live in New York City.

To preregister your child, you should bring the following: your child; your child's birth certificate, passport or baptismal certificate; immunization records; and verifiable proof of address."

2008-04-11T00:00:00Z,"LUIS CAMNITZER This pioneering Conceptual artist, who exhibits infrequently in New York City, has something new and something old in this concise solo. The new piece, ''Last Words,'' right, is a series of six large posterlike sheets of paper with a stream of printed text made up of hundreds of short, direct-address sentences: ''Tell Mom I love her. I love you all. Goodbye to my family. Don't forget me. I love all of you.'' And so on. The valedictory words suggest dire situations: I thought of cellphone calls made from the World Trade Center on 9/11. In fact all the phrases are from final statements made by death row prisoners, which Mr. Camnitzer found on the official Web site of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The sentiments subtly change in tone as the series progresses, shifting from loving farewells to giving thanks to helpful friends, including lawyers, to verbal displays of bravura. The final sentences in the piece are: ''I am ready. Tell the guys on Death Row that I'm not wearing a diaper. I can't think of anything else.''"

She filed a suit against Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff in February in which she claimed the fence would “virtually complete destruction of the character and use of the lands for hundreds of years.” The court said that there was no way to tell what the government would do to her property and that it had no way of knowing what it might do without access to her land."

There will be a wake for Dr. Murphy at the John Krtil Funeral Home at 1297 First Avenue (70th Street), on Sunday from 24pm and 7-9pm. Her funeral mass will be at St. Monicas Church at 413 East 79th Street (First Avenue) at 10am Monday, April 14th. MURPHY--Dr. M. Lois, (91) died April 8, 2008 at her home. From 1965 until 1976 she was Chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the first woman to be promoted to such a prestigious position. She was Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics in Therapeutic Research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and at Cornell University Medical College. Vogue magazine profiled her in its May 1967 ''The American Woman'' issue that featured other great American women of the day: Jacqueline Kennedy, Martha Graham, Mrs. William Paley and Judge Constance B. Motley. The full page article described Dr. Murphy's illustrious career in medicine and research and the impact that her ground - breaking re search had on the field of pediatric oncology. Literally thousands of patients owe their lives to Dr. Murphy and her efforts to develop pediatric oncology into a viable field where a diagnosis of cancer no longer meant a death sentence. In 1951, trained as a board certified pediatrician, she obtained a fellowship in medicine at Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases and in experimental chemotherapy at Sloan Kettering Institute for cancer in New York. Thus began a career in ground breaking chemotherapy research that resulted in the establishment of innovative treatment protocols that essentially created pediatric oncology 25 years before its formal creation as a field in 1971. At a time when pediatric cancer mortality was 99% Dr. Murphy used her background in chemistry and pediatrics to create treatments for children with cancer, particularly leukemia. Her development of a multidisciplinary treatment of cancers using chemotherapy, surgery and radiation and later pre-operative chemotherapy became a model for departments of pediatric oncology around the world that were later used in treatment of cancers in adults. She pioneered the idea of a day hospital for administering chemotherapy in 1968 for children and their families at a time when beds for children were in short supply. Visits to the day hospital increased from 6,000 in 1969 to 12,000 by 1974 and the cure rate of most of the cancers approached 80%. She is survived by nine nieces and nephews and thousands of grateful individuals and families around the world. Viewing: Sunday April 13th 2-4 pm and 7-9 pm, John Krtil Funeral Home, 1297 First Avenue. Mass 10:00 am Monday, Saint Monica's Church, 413 East 79th Street.

Ji Baek, the owner of Rescue Beauty Lounge in New York, created a dove-gray tone for the models at Narciso Rodriguez’s spring show. The shade matches this season’s popular neutral shoes (Fendi’s rope pump and Chloé’s architectural slingback), but is a no-no according to Baek when it comes to wearing florals.

The plots are remarkably similar: a suburban ingénue whose long limbs and high cheekbones are underappreciated by her classmates back home is anointed by some cartoonish, hardhearted booker and ventures into the dog-eat-dog world of Seventh Avenue go-sees and fashion-week catwalk shows."

In the picture, we were building a snow park with jumps, pipes, quarter-pipes. It was the first time I'd been on a tropical island like Samoa with beaches and blue water.

2008-04-13T00:00:00Z,"THE six Roman Catholic elementary schools in Bridgeport, Conn., had struggled for more than a decade to meet enrollment goals. Tuition kept them out of reach for at least the one in five local families who lived below the poverty line, and their rising operating costs strained the finances of parishes already finding it hard to make ends meet. In 2004, Bishop William E. Lori, who had replaced Cardinal Edward M. Egan as head of the Diocese of Bridgeport, issued a call to action. He enlisted the help of retired chief executives and fund-raising specialists, who then recruited patrons for the schools or school projects, like maintenance and library renovation. He met with pastors of African-American churches and told them that their children were welcome in the Catholic schools. And he advertised to Latino families on Spanish-language radio."

Elaine Cassidy stars as Lucy Honeychurch, above with Laurence Fox as Cecil Vyse; she's an innocent abroad in Italy with her tightly laced chaperone, Charlotte Bartlett (Sophie Thompson). When they find less-than-suitable accommodations at their pensione, a father and his son (played by the father-and-son actors Timothy and Rafe Spall) offer to exchange rooms. Then Lucy is kissed in a field of violets. The screenwriter Andrew Davies adds a coda imagining what might have happened after the Forster novel ends. 8 P.M.

Dr. L's spirit, works, and one of a kind personality touched so many people in so many ways that he will always be a vibrant, creative, and caring presence. The spirit of Steve, son of Ida and Frances Lehane, lives large in his wife the former Mary Puglisi (''May or Zip''); his son Christopher Lehane (''Smedgie'') and daughter-in-law Andrea Evans; his son Erik Lehane (''Goog'') and daughter-in-law Stephanie Clayton; daughter Erin Lehane (''X'') and son-inlaw Thomas Tureen. Poppy's grandchildren, Brady and Bennett (''The B Boys''), Katelin, Dominic (''Domino') and Quincy, loved nothing better than playing with the oldest, wisest kid they knewfrom water balloon battles to munching on M&M's. Dr. L broke the mold. He made a difference. Although he barely slept and seemingly sustained himself on candy, cold pizza and long runs, he left his mark. His good works were widely recognized and he received many awards--but the most important reward was the love of his family and the happiness of the many children whose lives he touched. Most recently, he served as the Director of the Avant! Foundation, which supported historically underserved children in the Bay Area and beyond. The good doctor was also a teacher, college professor, author, speaker, mentor, and director of various early childhood development not-for-profits. A graduate of Lawrence, MA schools, he attended the Naval Academy, St. Anselm's College, the University of New Hampshire, and received a Ph.D. in Early Childhood Education from Columbia University. Steve lived in Menlo Park, California and Boothbay Harbor, Maine after residing for many years in Kennebunk, Maine. He started his next chapter on April 7th in Menlo Park, California.

2008-04-13T00:00:00Z,"COOPER--Robert Joseph, of New York, NY died suddenly April 3, 2008 at his home in Manhattan. A man of uncommon dignity, Robert touched all who knew him with his intelligence, generosity, humor, and nobility of spirit. The unconventional path he followed was profoundly shaped by literature, art, and the rich life of the mind that so inspired him. His tireless resilience, fearless optimism, and elegant bearing will not be forgotten. Born September 9, 1931 in Oak Park, IL, Robert grew up in Pittsburgh, PA, and attended Shady Side Academy. At Yale University he earned an undergraduate degree in Literature, then served in the U.S. Army Artillery as First Lieutenant before returning to Yale for his Master's in Architecture. Robert lived in Europe before settling in Philadelphia where he worked in the office of Louis I. Kahn and then as principal of his own firm, Cooper & Pratt Architects. Known for his exquisite draftsmanship, he received design awards from both Yale University and the Philadelphia Chapter of AIA. In 1985 he moved to New York and, though he continued to work in architecture, embarked on a second career as a writer, sparked off by a transformative 10 year series of dreams which he experienced in his fifties, decisively changing his life. At the time of his death he was working on his third novel, and a collection of furniture designs. Robert's love for his family surpassed all else. He was the beloved husband of Theresa Savage Cooper, the loving father of Brice Beatrix Cooper and Audrey Osborne Cooper, and grandfather of Imogen Cooper Steed. He is survived by his sister, Idamae Rich, of Pittsburgh, PA; his brother, Alexander Cooper, of New York, NY; and his first wife, Elizabeth Osborne, of Philadelphia, PA. A memorial service will be held 2pm Friday, April 25 at the Yale Club of New York City, 50 Vanderbilt Ave."

2008-04-13T00:00:00Z,"Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the French founder of the modern Olympic Games, probably didn't have this in mind when he came up with a logo of five interlocking rings in 1913, a logo that was then incorporated into the Olympic flag in 1920. The rings stand for the five continents (North and South America share a ring, and Antarctica lacks eligible bipeds). But how tempting those adaptable rings are when it comes to protest, particularly against China, host of the 2008 Games. Creative alterations of the rings have highlighted grievances as the Olympic torch has made its way from city to city in the last couple of weeks. Many of the doctored-logo signs call for a free Tibet. Some call for an end to the Chinese role as an enabler to Sudan in the genocide in Darfur, and at least one calls for the independence of the Uighurs, a Muslim minority in western China."

2008-04-13T00:00:00Z,"MURPHY--Lois. The Department of Pediatrics and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center deeply mourn the passing of Lois Murphy, M.D. who died on April 8, 2008, at the age of 91. Dr. Murphy was a pioneer in the development of therapies combining multiple antineoplastic agents for children with cancer and a major force in the establishment of a national effort to develop, test and rapidly disseminate improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of malignancies of childhood. Dr. Murphy received her degree in medicine from the University of Nebraska in 1944. She was one of only two women in a class of one hundred. Thereafter, she completed an internship at Women's College of Pennsylvania, residency training in Pediatrics at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and additional residency training in Pathology at Children's Hospital, Washington, D.C. Dr. Murphy came to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in 1951 and was appointed to the faculty in 1952. With Joseph Burchenal, M.D., she began to examine the biologic and therapeutic effects of the first drugs then being introduced for the treatment of cancer. Over the subsequent 12 years, she and Dr. Burchenal introduced a series of new cancer drugs into the treatment of leukemias in children. In addition, Dr. Murphy pioneered the use of combinations of active cancer drugs in protocols designed to maximize their additive effects on tumors while limiting toxicities, achieving improvements in sustained remissions. In 1956, Dr. Murphy played a major role in the founding of the Cancer and Leukemia Group A, later named the Children's Cancer Study Group, a national multicenter cooperative program of clinical research and treatment for children with cancer. She chaired this program from 1958 to 1965, organizing systems whereby new treatments developed at specialized centers like MSKCC could be tested in national trials and extended to all affected children. Dr. Murphy was also the first woman to lead a clinical department at MSKCC. As Chair of the Department of Pediatrics from 1965 to 1976, she organized its faculty into multidisciplinary disease management teams focused on specific tumors and shepherded the development of multimodality treatment regimens that significantly improved prospects for cure for children afflicted with leukemia, lymphoma, and osteogenic sarcoma. These regimens remain the foundation of the most advanced therapies available today. During her career, Dr. Murphy received many honors, including an honorary Doctor of Science degree from her alma mater, The University of Nebraska. She retired as Member Emerita in 1992 after 41 years of service to MSKCC, but continued to participate in its education programs until shortly before her death. Dr. Murphy was an extraordinary individual who devoted her life to the welfare of children with cancer. She will be deeply missed. MURPHY--Lois. The Department of Pediatrics and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center deeply mourn the passing of Lois Murphy, M.D. who died on April 8, 2008, at the age of 91. There will be a wake for Dr. Murphy at the John Krtil Funeral Home at 1297 First Avenue (70th Street), on Sunday from 24pm and 7-9pm. Her funeral mass will be at St. Monicas Church at 413 East 79th Street (First Avenue) at 10am Monday, April 14th. MURPHY--Dr. M. Lois, (91) died April 8, 2008 at her home. From 1965 until 1976 she was Chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the first woman to be promoted to such a prestigious position. She was Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics in Therapeutic Research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and at Cornell University Medical College. Vogue magazine profiled her in its May 1967 ''The American Woman'' issue that featured other great American women of the day: Jacqueline Kennedy, Martha Graham, Mrs. William Paley and Judge Constance B. Motley. The full page article described Dr. Murphy's illustrious career in medicine and research and the impact that her ground - breaking re search had on the field of pediatric oncology. Literally thousands of patients owe their lives to Dr. Murphy and her efforts to develop pediatric oncology into a viable field where a diagnosis of cancer no longer meant a death sentence. In 1951, trained as a board certified pediatrician, she obtained a fellowship in medicine at Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases and in experimental chemotherapy at Sloan Kettering Institute for cancer in New York. Thus began a career in ground breaking chemotherapy research that resulted in the establishment of innovative treatment protocols that essentially created pediatric oncology 25 years before its formal creation as a field in 1971. At a time when pediatric cancer mortality was 99% Dr. Murphy used her background in chemistry and pediatrics to create treatments for children with cancer, particularly leukemia. Her development of a multidisciplinary treatment of cancers using chemotherapy, surgery and radiation and later pre-operative chemotherapy became a model for departments of pediatric oncology around the world that were later used in treatment of cancers in adults. She pioneered the idea of a day hospital for administering chemotherapy in 1968 for children and their families at a time when beds for children were in short supply. Visits to the day hospital increased from 6,000 in 1969 to 12,000 by 1974 and the cure rate of most of the cancers approached 80%. She is survived by nine nieces and nephews and thousands of grateful individuals and families around the world.

2008-04-13T00:00:00Z,"MEASURE FOR MEASURE Just recently I've gotten excited about writing songs again. I didn't get there by a happy epiphany, but by pain of another sort. My friend and great songwriting mentor, John Stewart, died unexpectedly in January. When I heard the news, I pulled out a file I had saved with all the letters and drawings and faxes he had sent me over the years; I noticed that the dual themes of love and madness kept reappearing in his notes. He used to say to me, upon hearing a new song of mine that he thought might be too perfect or careful or contrived, either lyrically or structurally, ''But where's the madness, Rose?'' His belief in songs, and his sense of liberation and expansion when he approached writing, was deeply inspiring. ...When I first began to know him, I felt that I had been speaking with a vocabulary of 200 words, and in a few months he taught me 10,000 more. ... Often, it's true for me that the lyrics come first. I seldom find just melodies on the guitar that come out fully fleshed, and add the lyrics afterward. ... My song ''Seven Year Ache'' began as a long poem, several pages of rambling, and I distilled it down into a lyric. The melody came last."

He was predeceased by his beloved wife of 56 years Ruth (Rickie) by just 7 months. Gil and Rickie are together again. Gil was a student of New York University and captain of the Swim Team when WWII broke out. On December 8, 1941 he joined the Army Air Force. In 1951 he bought Lees Art Shop on W. 57th St., just a few doors East of the Art Student League, measuring just 500 square feet. Gil was the buyer, salesman, wrapper, cashier and janitor. A year later Rickie joined Gil in business, and it flourished. In 1975 the business moved across the street to an old Schrafts Restaurant. Today as a result of their brilliant merchandising skills, and plain old fashion hard work, Lees Art Shop, and Lees Lighting and Furniture Studio and their over 100 employees, occupy a landmark 32,000 square feet at 220 W. 57 St., the ''Gilbert G. Steinberg Building, The House that Ruth Built.'' Gil and Rickie are survived by their three children, daughter Jillian (Jill) Isaacs, sons David and Mitchell, grandchildren Lauren and Brion Isaacs, and Evan, Chloe, and Elisabeth Steinberg and daughter-in-law Elissia. Together they were intensely devoted, generous, and loyal to their family, extended family, and many friends. Gil was an interesting man. He loved to laugh and make other people laugh. He was deeply interested in fine art, fine music, and numismatics. He was handsome, colorful, audacious, and proudly politically incorrect. Gil and Rickie will be sorely missed by the many people whose lives they touched over the 56 years they were together. Contributions in Memory of Gil may be made to the United Jewish Appeal (UJA) NY. Memorial Services were held at Riverside Memorial Chapel Sunday, April 6th 2008."
2008-04-13T00:00:00Z,"HOLMES--Richard, beloved teacher at Brooks School in North Andover, MA, died peacefully in Vero Beach, FL on March 30. He was 83. He came to Brooks School in 1948, intending to teach for only one year; forty-three years later he retired as assistant-headmaster of the school and settled in Cape Town, South Africa. His proudest achievement during his tenure was the introduction of the African Exchange Program between Brooks students and their counterparts at Bishops School in Cape Town. Richard hoped to encourage his students to become ''citizens of a larger world community''. The program was ahead of its time and has become a model for several schools since then. A lover of American art and artifacts, Richard befriended Andy Warhol in the 1960s and soon began collecting the artist's work. His entire collection of Warhols was recently given to Williams College, his alma mater. Brooks School will have lending rights.

On perhaps the most profound level, the question of why this troubled and angry youth chose to plan and carry out the killings may never be fully answered. But there were a host of other issues that had relevance for other universities and for policymakers in general. They include:* whether Mr. Cho's history of mental illness should have barred him from purchasing the guns he used, and whether the system needed to be tightened* whether campuses would be safer if more students and faculty members could have guns to use to protect themselves* whether concerns over privacy stood in the way of adequate steps being taken to protect Mr. Cho's classmates and himself* and what if any changes needed to be made to emergency response procedures at schools across the country.A group of people with expertise on different aspects of these questions has agreed to discuss these issues. To begin, each will address what has happened - and what hasn't - in the field they know best in the last year."
