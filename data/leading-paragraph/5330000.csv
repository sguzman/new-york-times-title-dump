1988-11-09T00:00:00Z,"Even before a killer doll turns up in ''Child's Play,'' you may feel you've dropped into ''The Twilight Zone'' -the television show, not the place. As a detective chases a murderer down a murky Chicago street and into a toy store, the scene looks so television-perfect, so shallow, artificial and lurid, that you expect the camera to pull back and reveal that we've really been watching television. Though the film never becomes so blatantly ironic, the television look suits Tom Holland's clever, playful thriller. Straddling the line between sendup and suspense, ''Child's Play'' occupies the narrow, self-conscious space that is truly ''Twilight Zone'' territory. When the detective (Chris Sarandon) shoots the scraggly-looking ''Lakeshore Strangler'' (Brad Dourif), lightning flashes over the toy store and the murderer begins to chant. He throws his departing soul into the nearest available body - a three-foot-tall talking doll called a Good Guy."

As a matter of fact, I have stopped sending money to my political party and devote all my contributions to the senior cause now. Ironically, this essentially defensive reaction has strengthened senior organizations to the point that they may be able to regain some of the ground lost in the last decade, and that would be only simple justice."

1988-11-25T00:00:00Z,"Made in Italy during World War II, at first approved by the Fascists and then banned from theaters, ''We the Living'' has lost its political urgency. But it has gained historical interest, not to mention unintended kitsch. Seeing Rossano Brazzi play an aristocratic White Russian, standing in the fakest snow that wartime supplies could buy, may be the most peculiar twist of all in the curious story of how Ayn Rand's autobiographical first novel came to the screen. In 1942, the director Goffredo Alessandrini helped himself, without any legal right, to Rand's novel, which was set in the years after the Russian Revolution. Even Rand's earliest writing anticipated the self-aggrandizing heroes of her most famous works, ''The Fountainhead'' and ''Atlas Shrugged.'' A simplistic paean to the lost wealth and freedom of upper-class individuals, ''We the Living'' is so anti-Communist that it makes ''Doctor Zhivago'' look like ''The Communist Manifesto.''"

1988-12-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Congratulations to Mark Hunter on having found the right person (About Men, ''Vive la Difference,'' Nov. 13). Surely, he owes American women no apology or explanation for marrying outside his own country. But his personal good luck should create no occasion for bad-thing American feminists. If, at times, we have had to move away from conventional manners, it has been in state legislatures, the halls of Congress and the offices of university presidents and corporate boards of directors."

1988-12-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Probably not, because of the ever mounting medical evidence that steroids cause severe long term physical maladies. But in a society that condones team doctors injecting injured players with cortisone and other pain numbing potions, which surely cause as much damage as steroids, one needs to look at the greater question of ''What price victory?"

Negroponte, come together under the same roof. But all four men joined Secretary of State George P.

1988-12-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: President Reagan has done few things as sharply disappointing to many of his conservative supporters as his decision, made known last week, not to pardon Oliver North before trial. A pardon for the former Marine colonel had become the passion of the political right."

1988-12-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Your article on Eastern Airlines served to emphasize how little regard companies have for their employees, especially long-term ones. Is it any wonder that employees no longer have any company loyalty? How can they, when they must live every day wondering when they will be made expendable in order to line someone else's pocket?"
1988-12-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Consider next Wednesday, Dec. 7, 1988. It's not likely to be as famous as its 1941 predecessor, the day of Pearl Harbor. Still, it may live on in a lesser infamy. Wednesday promises to be a day for the Guinness Book of Gridlock."
1988-12-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: To the Editor: A recent combination vacation-shopping trip to Mexico City, Taxco and Cuernavaca ended on a sour note. Some $1,000 worth of carefully selected examples of Mexican jewelry were stolen from my luggage between the Mexico City airport and Kennedy International. While Kennedy is certainly no stranger to crime or theft, the major opportunity for stripping my bags was at the Mexican end - better than two hours on the ground there versus less than 45 minutes in New York, including Customs check."
1988-12-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Your article implied that Eastern airlines might become profitable if its long-term employees would grant concessions.
