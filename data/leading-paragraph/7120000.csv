2008-09-21T00:00:00Z,"More than a decade before Jack Kerouac and the Beats went on the road, another group of writers crisscrossed the country for art. Beginning in 1935, the W.P.A. Federal Writers’ Project put thousands to work documenting the young nation, with a payroll that included journalists and novelists like Studs Terkel, John Steinbeck and Zora Neale Hurston. The American Guides series they produced is today a collectible bookshelf of literary Americana and a monument to our small towns and back roads before the emergence of mass culture. So when Matt Weiland and Sean Wilsey decided to create a “road trip in book form” in 2006, they turned to the W.P.A. guides for inspiration. The two friends are heavy hitters on the belles-lettres circuit: Weiland is deputy editor of The Paris Review, and Wilsey is a longtime editor of the quarterly McSweeney’s. But you’ll still wonder how they managed to coerce or cajole so much talent into “State by State” (Ecco, $30). Fifty-one writers serve as guides and fellow wayfarers in this part almanac, part literary anthology, from the journalist George Packer on Alabama to the novelist Edward P. Jones on Washington, D.C. Along the way you get Jim Lewis’s one-night stand in Wichita, Kan.; Alison Bechdel’s graphic memoir of going native in Vermont; Dave Eggers on Illinois; plus William T. Vollmann on California, Ha Jin on Georgia and Alexandra Fuller on Wyoming. How should readers use this book? “The way each original W.P.A. state guide is used now,” Weiland says. “As a kind of guidebook to the soul of each state.” [?][?][?]BLAKE WILSON."

2008-09-21T00:00:00Z,"Trendy streets are slow to form in Paris, which makes the one-year evolution of the rue André del Sarte an overnight sensation. The blocklong strip, bookended by a bank and a leafy cliff below Sacré-Coeur, had been home to mostly art and graphic design studios, but now boutiques and restaurants are moving in. The transformation was kick-started when the folks behind the popular area restaurant La Famille opened Chéri Bibi (No. 15, 011-33-1-42-54-88-96), a hipster canteen that serves simple food and turns into a party after dessert. At about the same time of night at No Problemo, on the corner (14 rue Charles Nodier, 011-33-1-42-54-39-38), the house tartare gets pushed aside to make room for live music. During the day, shoppers will find shoes and clothes from independent labels like Gaspard Yurkievich at Ysasu (No. 19, 011-33-9-50-58-67-81), as well as Béatrice Knoch’s gold and silver jewelry next door at No. 17 (011-33-1-42-57-97-09).

At Andrew Chadwick’s at Rutledge Hill (37 Rutledge Street; 615-254-8585; entrees $22 to $36), the chef takes the high road all the way, with dishes like salmon with tomato foam.

Which is why Globe-Trotter, the British luxury brand commemorating its 110th anniversary this year, has created the onehundred&ten, which they’ve pronounced “the lightest suitcase in the world.” Designed by Ross Lovegrove using a proprietary carbon-fiber-and-Kevlar material, the suitcase is as light as a tray table (three pounds) and as durable as a 747 (five times stronger than its weight in steel). $3,525; available only at Moss (mossonline.com).

2008-09-21T00:00:00Z,"The towering wood door swings open, and it’s the glow that strikes me first. My hosts, Daniele Kihlgren and Michele Zasa, lead me out of the blazing afternoon heat and into a vast Neolithic cave with 20-foot-high walls that seem to be lit from within. The walls are carved out of soft tufa stone the color of honey and pockmarked with hundreds of pits and crevasses, chiseled by the shepherds who have lived here over the past 2,500 years. Zasa, a local guide, points out fossilized seashells embedded in the double-height rock ceiling and a pear-shaped cistern once used as a well. In hushed tones we admire the graceful vaulted archways that look as though they’ve been splattered with lumpy cake batter. Despite having lasted millennia, they appear oddly fragile. There’s an agreeably musty odor in the cool air, and it’s profoundly quiet. Kihlgren hands me a massive iron skeleton key that falls with a dull thud to the bottom of my purse. This is where I’ll be spending the night."

2008-09-21T00:00:00Z,"STEINWAY--Henry Z. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sorrow the passing of its former President and Chairman, Henry Z. Steinway, on Thursday, September 18 in New York City at the age of 93. A great grandson of the firm's founder, Mr. Steinway was actively involved with the Company up to the time of his death, maintaining an office at Steinway Hall in Manhattan. Born in New York City in 1915, Mr. Steinway began his association with the firm as a factory apprentice in 1937 following graduation from Harvard. He rose through the ranks, becoming Factory Manager in 1946 upon discharge from the service, and was named Vice President in 1947. He served with distinction as President from 1955 to 1977, and as Chairman from 1977 to 1980. In 1980 he became a Consultant to the Company, a position which he held to present day. He married Polly Zinsser in 1944, who survives him, as does his sister Lydia Steinway Cochrane, and his five children. Henry Z. Steinway was a true piano man, and his familiar presence at Steinway Hall was our greatest treasure. An avid correspondent with curators, customers, Steinway dealers and celebrated artists through the years, Mr. Steinway enjoyed a perspective of the changing musical world that few in our industry will experience. Though his typewriter is silenced, our lives have been forever enriched by his personal warmth, his candor, and by his unwavering faith in the instrument that bears his name.

2008-09-21T00:00:00Z,"REALITY shows are usually classified along structural lines -- competition shows, makeover shows, dating shows, etc. This snapshot of the 2008 fall reality television season takes a different approach. We've grouped the shows by the primal human need to which they respond. Because reality isn't worth much without a roof over your head, some food on the table and a new pair of harem pants, after all. Defining a reality show is also a subjective exercise. We've taken a broad view: any nonfiction (and nonnews, nonsports or nontalk) show that's roughly in prime time (sorry, ''Flip This House''); is on one of the six major English-language broadcast networks or one of the Top 25 nonnews cable channels, as they were ranked by Nielsen at the beginning of the year (sorry, Animal Planet, CMT, National Geographic, Oxygen, Travel and WE, among others); and is presenting new episodes between now and the end of the year (sorry, ''Deadliest Catch'' and ''American Idol''). The resulting 120-plus shows represent a good share of what's new in reality.

2008-09-21T00:00:00Z,"LANDRUM--Jacqui, 1943-August 29, 2008, Dancer, Choreographer and Teacher. We mourn the passion of Jacqui Landrum. An innovative explorer within her craft, Jacqui was a dancer whose devotion to studying the body in motion enabled her to create a legacy of expression that will be carried forward by the students she cherished. At an early age Jacqui performed around the country with the Larry Muldonado Dance Troup. Jacqui's first professional job as a choreographer was for Hollywood A Go Go, where she became an originator of Freestyle Jazz and Go Go dance moves for television. In 1977, Jacqui and her husband Bill Landrum established their own company, Landrum Dance Theatre. Bill recalls that ''dancers from all forms of the craft were drawn to Jacqui because she had the ability to transcend technique.'' Legendary dancer and friend Paula Kelly paid tribute to Jacqui, recalling her ''artistic principals, core truthfulness, and honest, old school knowledge.'' Jacqui and Bill taught stage movement and drama at USC for seventeen years. In tandem with their teaching, Bill and Jacqui established their prolific careers as choreographers for film, television, and theater. The films they contribute their unique style to included; Oliver Stone's The Doors, Paul Verhoeven's Basic Instinct as well as The Big Lebowski, Barton Fink, and O Brother, Where Art Thou for the Coen brothers. They were also nominated for an American Choreography Award for their work on O Brother, Where Art Thou, and won another for their work on a Discover Card commercial. Always on the cutting edge, Jacqui and Bill were also among the first to adopt dance therapy as physical fitness. Jacqui was a key factor in broadening the appeal of Pilates in Los Angeles, influencing and inspiring dancers with her unique and enthusiastic perspective. Jacqui's continued to expand to the world of Gyrotonics. Jacqui's immersion into Gyrotonics and Gyrokinesis was powerful. For her, Gyrotonics was the culmination of the ultimate body/ mind/spirit potential. A life long student Jacqui never stopped pushing herself to new levels. Jacqui and Bill launched their private studio in the 1990s. The studio allowed them to offer their dance, Pilates, and Gyrotonics expertise to both dancers and laymen alike. As a teacher, Jacqui took great pride in her students' evolution and found great reward in sharing the connections she had discovered between movement and spirit Jacqui's final days were spent in the company of her friends and beloved husband. The breadth and reach of Jacqui Landrum's influence in the world of dance and movement will not be forgotten. The lessons she so delighted in learning and passing on will carry forward in the spirit of all those she inspired. A celebration of Jacqui's life will be announced later this year."

2008-09-21T00:00:00Z,"EVANS--Judith London, on September 12 after a year long battle with cancer. She was valiant to the end and surrounded by family. She was 61 years old. Judith was born and raised in Montgomery, Alabama, and in 1971, a few years after graduating from Emory University in Atlanta, came to TIAACREF, the financial services institution that serves thousands of universities and colleges across America. She stayed for 36 years. She actually made history at the corporation all through her years there. She was the first woman to represent TIAACREF with institutional clients, working with dozens of colleges and universities around the country and served as a role model and mentor for many women who followed her. In 1988, Judith opened the New York City Regional Office and became the first woman to lead a TIAA-CREF local office. By 1994, Judith's office was responsible for 175,000 TIAACREF participants in the region in 1,000 participating institutions. In the most recent chapter of her career, she served as director of corporate meetings and special events, and managed the unit responsible for regional meetings for employees and clients all across the country. Herb Allison, president of TIAA-CREF from 2002 to 2008 wrote of her: ''Judith was a remarkably gracious, kind and caring person with a superb intellect. Her contributions to the culture and reputation of TIAA-CREF were uniquely valuable. As a colleague, Judith was a special joy. Her astute advice and subtle support behind the scenes helped me in countless ways.'' Judith was also deeply committed to Emory University. From 1992 to 1995, she served on the inaugural Dean's Council, was also involved with the creation of the Tam Institute for Jewish Studies and with women's issues on campus through the Center for Women. In 2006 she was one of two alumni to receive the Emory University Distinguished Alumni and Faculty Award. In her personal life, she was active in Jewish affairs as a life member of Hadassah and in many fundraising activities for various institutions. In addition to her husband Eli Evans and her son, Joshua, she is survived by Jack London, a brother in Montgomery, AL; Mark London in Washington, D.C. Contributions should be sent to the Tam Center for Jewish Studies at Emory University; the Brotherhood Synagogue in NYC; or, in honor of Dr. Jeffrey Tepler, her unusually empathetic oncologist, to the Judith Evans Lung Cancer Research Fund, c/o Dr. David Nanus, Weil Cornell Medical College 525 East 68th St., NY, NY 10021."

The energetic and successful Director of Development and Communications for Episcopal Social Services of New York, Inc., died on Thursday, September 11th at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York City. Her unexpected death was the result of a brain aneurysm. She was 49. Ms. Hui came to Episcopal Social Services with a distinguished career of over 25 years in the field of philanthropic and fundraising administration. During her three-year tenure at ESS, she revitalized the development activities of the 177year old social services agency, nearly tripling the total annual revenue solicited from individuals, private foundations, and corporations. She also instituted an ongoing upgrade of the organization's publications and branding to reflect the breadth and professionalism of its nonsectarian outreach. In addition to her prodigious fundraising skills, Ms. Hui was known for the vitality and collegiality with which she approached her work. As an always-popular visitor among the young children in Episcopal Social Services' Early Head Start and After-School Programs, she took pride in the knowledge that the solicitations she made directly benefited disadvantaged and vulnerable children in New York City and their families. Her unfailingly warm and hospitable attitude toward her co-workers helped to cultivate the feeling of community she felt was so important to support the agency's Foster Care, Early Childhood Education, and Family Preservation workers. ''It's all about the children'', she was often heard to say. A graduate of Georgetown University, Ms. Hui began her development career as Assistant Regional Director of Development at that institution's Washington, DC and New York City offices before opening a development and alumni relations office in Los Angeles. Later relocating to the East Coast, she served as Director of Corporate and Foundation Relations for Connecticut's Fairfield University; Director of Development for the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University; and Director of the $40 million Parsons Campaign at the Parsons School of Design in New York City. In 2000, she became the first Director of Development at the Corporation for Supportive Housing, diversifying the base of support for the New York Citybased national organization, and two years later became Director of Institutional Advancement at the Marymount School in New York City, where she managed all aspects of the school's development, alumnae and parent relations, special events, and communications. Funeral services were held on Saturday, September 13th at Our Lady of Pompeii Church in Greenwich Village. Ms. Hui is survived by her beloved husband, Kai Hui of New York City; her parents Annette and Charles Hishta of Roanoke, Virginia; and her brothers Kevin Hishta of Atlanta, Georgia, and John Hishta of Arlington, Virginia. A Memorial Fund in Ms. Hui's honor has been established by the Episcopal Social Services Board of Directors. Marshall Green, Board Chair Kenneth Kramer, Board President Robert H.

Passing the meadow, the trail gains altitude via some tightly carved switchbacks over loose dry scree on its way above treeline and the summit of Elk Mountain. Elk Mountain is not a peak so much as a rocky, tundra-covered ridge, maybe five feet wide, from which the land falls away in great sweeping voids. To the north, the mountains tumble down toward the coast of the Olympic Peninsula, the shimmering Strait of Juan de Fuca and, just at the extreme line of sight, the hazy blue hills of Vancouver Island. To the south, across deep timbered valleys, the view gives on to a succession of jagged peaks known as the Needles and the thick, gleaming ice field atop Mount Olympus."

2008-09-21T00:00:00Z,"EN ROUTE FROM DHARAMSALA TO NEW DELHI AFTER A VISIT TO THE DALAI LAMA, MAY 12, 2008 His Eminence Tsona Rinpoche, 42, a Tibetan Buddhist monk and member of the legislative assembly of Arunachal Pradesh, an Indian state on the Chinese border: ''Almost 11 legislative members from Arunachal Pradesh, including the chief minister, went to the Dalai Lama to show our very much concern about incidents that happened in Tibet. Many innocent people have died, and His Holiness is trying to resolve those problems. In Arunachal Pradesh, we have a similar dialect and society to Tibet. China is always claiming our territory. In our assembly there are 60 members. I am the lone member in the assembly as a Buddhist monk, but around 30 or 40 members are Buddhist. Because I have been recognized as the reincarnation of a great master, I am always associated with the Dalai Lama. He's not after power; his concern is only that Tibetan people should be happy, that the culture, society and language should be preserved.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

2008-09-21T00:00:00Z,"The photographer Olaf Otto Becker works best in a haze. ''Sun and shadows often design an image on their own,'' he says. ''I want to show a landscape's mood.'' His photographs are often the result of trips to remote places like Greenland -- the subject of his 2007 book, ''Broken Line'' (Hatje Cantz) -- and, for this issue, the high-altitude Andean nation of Bolivia (''Day of Ascension,'' Page 132). Becker's poetic documentation of the natural world has given his work unexpected political implications. In 1998, on one of his early trips to Iceland, Becker snapped a picture of an impressive glacier; when he returned four years later, it had vanished. ''Even the polar bears are having trouble finding shelter and food,'' he says. While he makes no claim to being the next Al Gore, he hopes his photographs show the ''worth of these regions.'' But for Becker, it's bittersweet: ''An icecap melting into a rushing river can be very beautiful, but this transition itself is something worth thinking about.'' AMBROISE TÉZENAS"

2008-09-23T00:00:00Z,"HAYES--Johnny, a former TVA director and iconic national Democratic fundraiser known for his irresistible charm, deep loyalties and desire to help others, died Saturday. He was 67. His family issued a statement through Dep Governor Brunson saying Hayes died of stomach cancer at his home 30 miles NE of Nashville. Hayes was Al Gore's campaign finance chairman when he was elected to the US House in 1976 and his subsequent Senate victories as well as his presidential bids in 1988 and 2000. ''He was a great friend and a wonderful ally,'' Gore said in a statement. ''I never would have been elected to Congress without him. He was the key, for me and for many others.'' ''A great many people across Tennessee, across our nation, have lost a friend today,'' Gov Bredesen said in a statement. ''Many knew Johnny as a powerful business and political leader; Andrea and I knew him as a friend.'' Hayes founded an insurance firm that grew into one of the largest agencies in Middle Tennessee. He served in then-Gov Ned McWherter's administration from 1991-1993. In 1993, Gore nominated Mr. Hayes to become TVA director. Roy Neel, a longtime associate of Gore and his current COS, said, ''Particularly this day and time when politics has become so cutthroat and mean and personal, it was never personal with Johnny. He had great friends in every part of the political spectrum, but he never forgot there were more important things than politics or winning. They just don't make them anymore like Johnny.'' Ronnie Steine, a Tennessee elected official said, ''The key to Johnny's success in everything he did was the ability to relate to people one-on-one. By the end of a conversation you felt you had a friend for life.'' Mr. Hayes was known for having built one of the most extensive collections of political memorabilia. Funeral services will be held in Gallatin, TN and a tribute in connection with his political collection will be scheduled early next year. Our hearts go out to our dear friend, Johnny's daughter, Amy, and all of the members of the Hayes family.

Just ask Mitt Romney, whom Mr. McCain filleted on several occasions in the primaries, perhaps most infuriatingly for Mr. Romney when Mr. McCain misleadingly asserted that Mr. Romney favored a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq."

Later, as I wended down the off ramp in the taxi we caught sight of more of the track - the backside of the pit building - and really saw the splendor of this night-lit circuit. It's said to be four times brighter than a stadium, and I believe it. What a great sight it is.And so on to my hotel near ""Little India,"" a strip of streets full of Indian restaurants and stores. I ate in one of those restaurants, and on the other side of the street as I paid my bill I caught a glimpse of two signs, one on a store and one on the street corner, that looked kind of funny to me in the context of the arrival of Formula One to this new Monaco of the East. (Monaco in F1 terms: Money, glitz, wheeling and dealing, glamor, etc.) The one was a rather old fashion looking sign that said: Race Course Lane.

But a city study found that one of the biggest obstacles to increased bicycle commuting is not safety, but rather the lack of secure bike parking at work -- particularly in areas like Midtown Manhattan. Having a safe place to store a bike at work is an urban amenity that ranks somewhere with having unfettered roof access or a key to a community garden."
2008-09-24T15:48:18Z,"Citing the economic crisis, Senator John McCain said today he would temporarily suspend his campaign and return to Washington, asking Senator Barack Obama and the Commission on Presidential Debates to postpone the first head-to-head, scheduled for Friday night.

2008-09-24T15:13:18Z,"In the criticism of the federal government's economic bailout strategy, free-market conservatives have been among the most specific in identifying what they see are its flaws.

2008-09-24T14:42:32Z,"The initial Treasury stance on the bailout was one of sheer demand for authority: give us total discretion and a blank check, and we'll fix things.

Born in the early 1920s to a small DutchAmerican family, Jeannette was the youngest of four children. Demonstrating precocious talents in both writing and music, Jeannette was home-schooled with her brothers before attending the University of Michigan; in 1943, 1944 and 1945, she won four University of Michigan English Department Hopwood Prizes for ''minor' and ''summer'' poetry and for her extended narrative poem, ''Rip Van Winkles Dream.'' In addition, Jeannette per formed extensively as a pianist throughout the mid-West before and immediately after her 1948 marriage to Ernest Ballard, then a law student at the University of Michigan. In 1950, the Ballards moved to New York City, from then on their permanent home. Pursuing her professional career under her maiden name, Jeannette Haien taught piano privately and, subsequently, as a member of the piano faculty of Mannes College of Music (1969-1991); she toured biennially with the cultural outreach programs of the United States Information Agency in Europe, Asia and Central America throughout the 1960s and 1970s. During the early 1980's, Haien turned her energies increasingly to writing and, in 1986, published ''The All of It,'' for which she garnered strong critical praise and the Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction awarded by the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1987. Haien's second novel, ''Matters of Chance'' was published in 1997. Jeannette's husband of 60 years died on September 14 of this year. Jeannette Haien Ballard is survived by a daughter, Jean Ballard Terepka, and a grandson, Henry Ballard Terepka, both of New York City, in addition to two nieces and one nephew.

The rain has subsided to a light mist and it looks like the Mets will be able to start at the twice-adjusted time of 1:45. What time they'll finish, however, is a mystery. The forecast suggests that the heavens could open up again at any moment."

2008-09-27T13:32:12Z,"As Manager Jerry Manuel discussed the changes he had made in the Mets' lineup, he was casual about what they meant. Sure, Manuel had switched Carlos Beltran to the second spot and dropped Daniel Murphy to fifth in the order, but Manuel minimized the alterations by saying the batters needed to play their ""little hip hop music"" and go to the plate."

2008-09-27T12:36:42Z,"The first question Jerry Manuel faced when he walked into the interview room here at Shea Stadium came from a reporter asking if the lineup in the clubhouse was real. After all, with your team two games from the end of the season and clinging desperately to playoff hopes, this is not usually a natural time to revamp the batting order. At this rate, the kitchen sink will be pinch-hitting later."

2008-09-27T11:26:17Z,"Re ""Make It Airtight"" (Sept. 21): I was gratified to read that Richard Stevenson, the editor who directs The Times's coverage of the election, said that ""we don't want to fall into the trap of false equivalency"" when accurately reporting the false and misleading advertising, speeches and statements employed by Senator John McCain and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin.I might have termed it ""artificial balance,"" but ""false equivalency"" works for me, too.For far too long we've heard ""fair and balanced"" when it could just as well have been termed ""irrelevant falsehoods mouthed by a spinmeister"" running in the same article or airing in the same broadcast as ""factual information from a candidate.""Frankly, I'd welcome regulations requiring ads, speeches and press releases to present facts that can be verified from all political candidates, elected or appointed officeholders or chief executives.If we'd had them all along, our political landscape, our financial fortunes and our present world persona would be very different.Rita L. McKeeNew York, Sept. 21, 2008 ● Reporters are not restricted to second-person reporting. Reporters are allowed to speak with their own voice. A reporter has a higher duty than a person being quoted by the reporter.People being quoted can indulge themselves in partiality. But a reporter, to maintain credibility, must attempt to report ""truthfully.""The writer of an editorial is making a statement, which is understood to have some partiality to it. An editorial speaks with an editor's or a publisher's voice. And that voice does not have to present itself as impartial, as a reporter of facts, although it can.Jackie AldridgeAlameda, Calif., Sept. 21, 2008 ● The quote attributed to The Times's executive editor, Bill Keller - ""We had to fit it into a manageable space"" - is just a defense mechanism in selective reporting to support a preconceived conclusion. Crossing the line between reporting and editorial comments in a news article leads to strengthening the decline of news reporting credibility and use of obvious distortions.Don TenerowiczEllington, Conn., Sept. 21, 2008●●Re ""Getting Past the Formalities"" (Sept. 14): It's very nice of you to admit that using Barack Obama's middle name, Hussein, three times on the front page on Aug. 28 was an ""overkill"" and that by not using John McCain's full name, John Sidney McCain III, in exactly the same situation, The Times was a tad inconsistent in its treatment of the two candidates.But are you certain of the reasons Mr. McCain's name was abbreviated where Mr. Obama's was not? Are you sure that it wasn't because Mr. McCain ""prefers"" to forget both Sidney and (even more) the fact that he's the third of the line? Or that by omitting it, The Times wasn't bowing to Mr. McCain's preferences?The Times has seemed to be heavily invested in the earth-moving business: make every molehill about Mr. Obama into a mountain and vice versa.Tamara P. DuvallLexington, Va., Sept. 14, 2008 ● It's funny, a few months ago I had been reading The Times and had noticed, somewhat irritably, the use of ""Mrs."" when referring to Hillary Clinton. I love the newspaper and trust it implicitly (this might not exactly be a good thing), but I was put off by the decision not to use the more P.C. ""Ms.""Then I was annoyed when I noticed ""Ms. Palin,"" feeling that such considerations were wasted on someone so terrifying and - well, all those adjectives you want to use on her.I'm glad you answered this for me. If you hadn't addressed it, I doubt I would ever have had any clarification on this issue and maybe unfairly judged the paper's editors.Brianna SnyderSpringfield, Mass., Sept. 15, 2008●●Re ""The Scrutiny of Sarah Palin"" (Sept. 7): The Times has been absolutely correct in its scrutiny of Gov. Sarah Palin.After inflating Ms. Palin's family leadership role and small-town values into legitimate qualifications for the vice presidency, the McCain camp is now claiming that anyone who examines these areas has violated her family's privacy.The Times needs to look even deeper into Ms. Palin's scant record. The possibility that this woman might wield power over the entire country is terrifying.Thea AndersonLincoln, Mass., Sept. 8, 2008 ● I don't buy your column.The coverage The Times has provided of Gov. Sarah Palin has been biased.It's O.K. to be biased. We all are, to some degree.What is not O.K. is when The Times refuses to admit it, or recognize it.Phil GrimmRogue River, Ore., Sept. 8, 2008 ● The Times's coverage of Gov. Sarah Palin has been absolutely fair and totally needed.We are not living in the Joe McCarthy era of fear or the George W. Bush era of lies anymore. After The Times was initially hoodwinked by President Bush's invasion of Iraq, it vowed it would never shy away from investigating issues and getting to the truth of the matter.The Times vetted Barack Obama and now it is vetting Ms. Palin.This is a crucial election, so please, Times, continue to dig deep and report your findings accurately. We voters can handle the truth.Kathy BergerSan Anselmo, Calif., Sept. 8, 2008 ● I concur with your take on unjustified Republican complaints about the scrutiny of Gov. Sarah Palin. Vice-presidential candidates are not vetted by the voters, so unless these candidates have visible public records, such as that of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., we are left to rely on what is released by campaign operatives - not the most reliable sources.Thus it is left to mainstream journalists to pose the serious questions about the candidates. In this case, the G.O.P. is merely seeking to embellish a paper-thin public record and head off potentially embarrassing questions.Had the McCain campaign properly investigated Ms. Palin, it would not be playing catch-up on this matter.Vaughn A. CarneyStowe, Vt., Sept. 8, 2008 ● It is clear that the press must be even more vigilant in its job this political season.With Steve Schmidt in charge of the McCain campaign and his mentor, Karl Rove, manning a commentator's desk at Fox News, the people of American need to know more than ever who is spinning out the information contained in news stories.More often then not we see campaign and commentator remarks cut and pasted into news stories without attribution (such as Sarah Palin's claim that she said, ""Thanks but no thanks on that Bridge to Nowhere"") without providing the evidence to prove their veracity.Now more than ever, it is up to the press in our free and democratic society to root out the use of the press for political gain (propaganda). Don't let Mr. Rove and his disciples use the press to sell Ms. Palin and John McCain the same way they used the press to sell the Iraq war.Debra HollowayRye, N.H., Sept. 8, 2008 ● Thank you to The Times for its continued efforts to give a whole picture of who Gov. Sarah Palin is. I hadn't realized how much the paper had already done.I appreciate your straightforward response about all of the recent criticism of The Times. At the moment there is nothing more important than informing the public before the election.In Ms. Palin we seem to have a hard-working, hard-hitting lady with some decent accomplishments and with exceptional looks (this is worthy of mention, as it seems to capture the imagination of the electorate). But there has been considerable stretching of the truth. She is in absolutely no way prepared to move into a position of power any greater than she presently has.I see many danger signs and can only hope (and expect) that The Times will continue the journalism we're seeing in regard to the vetting process.D. MandellSeattle, Sept. 7, 2008 ● The Times is investigating Sarah Palin in order to analyze her judgment, understanding, persuasiveness to skeptics, contacts and other attributes necessary for success in the vice presidency and, potentially, the presidency.Attempting to undermine this investigation creates a reasonable inference of a motive to conceal.The honor of the investigative reporters of The Times needs no defending. At times, it is the judgment of editors that has come into question. There is no journalistic need to defend the reports of the investigation - its accuracy speaks for itself.But as a letter writer has asked, where is The Times in reporting whether the stated goals of the people running for the presidency and the vice presidency would allow them faithfully to carry out the oath of office to ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed""?Robert LiebrossWestbury, N.Y., Sept. 7, 2008 ● The response to the bashing of Gov. Sarah Palin in the news media always seems to be, ""We have a duty to ask questions,"" and then to add that Republicans don't like to be questioned.Reports on FactCheck.org, a University of Pennsylvania program, show that many of the ""questions"" the media are asking are lightly veiled attacks, often containing false accusations. There are hundreds of reporters asking similar ""questions."" This is why people see such a powerful bias in much of the media.For example, CNN, in an interview on Sept. 4 with a senior adviser to the McCain campaign, asked how much of a problem it would be that Ms. Palin had significantly cut the budget in Alaska for special needs children. The reporter said she had been getting ""a lot of e-mails about the subject."" But in fact, as FactCheck.org notes, Ms. Palin increased funding for special education dramatically.CNN could have spent less than five minutes in a Google search to know that the ""question"" was a false accusation.The news media does not start questions to Barack Obama with ""How does a radical Muslim terrorist like you expect to be able to attract American voters?"" But reporters don't hesitate to ask such questions of Republicans.Joe DennyWayne, Pa., Sept. 9, 2008 ● Thank you to The Times for printing stories about Gov. Sarah Palin and for continuing to look into her record and positions. I want to know as much as possible before Election Day! I don't really get the people who think this should be off limits.Please don't let up. I especially appreciated the extremely informative article about the vetting process.Jen BinghamIndianapolis, Sept. 8, 2008 ●You provide an excellent defense of what should not have to be defended - journalists digging into the reality behind a campaign's spin.It's a shame that the McCain team has forced the news media to work overtime to compensate for its clearly sloppy vetting of its vice-presidential pick.I commend The Times for writing anything newsworthy that it finds out about a woman who is unknown to the American public but who has vaulted to celebrity status for the most superficial of reasons - her image.The woman could well be making executive decisions affecting all our lives. She has so far shown herself to be completely ill equipped to do so. It's the responsibility of all media to ignore appearances and get to the facts that will reveal the substance of this woman.Patty GrossmanBrooklyn, Sept. 7, 2008"

2008-09-28T00:00:00Z,"Savoir-faire meets moxie, and a fine romance begins. Flirtatious overtures and tender embraces, envious glances and cold shoulders all play a role in making the exhibition “Paris/New York: Design Fashion Culture 1925-1940” (at the Museum of the City of New York from Oct. 3) as provocative and entertaining as the glamorously staged revues that once regaled the smart set on both sides of the pond. The museum’s curtain goes up on the 1925 Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes (enter sophisticated, French-accented Art Deco, trailed by an adoring chorus of Yanks) and falls shortly after the 1939-40 New York World’s Fair (Gotham’s hometown modernism — plucky ingénue turned diva — belts out her own triumphant anthem to liberty and the pursuit of progress). But because this production combines déjà vu with 21st-century double takes and uncensored city-to-city dialogue, it’s far from the straight revival the title may suggest."

His goal was to help them make vases and bowls for a new eco-conscious line by Cappellini. Next he headed to Australia to work with Aborigine artists for a Nature Conservancy project, which has enlisted designers, including Hella Jongerius and Ted Muehling, to scout indigenous materials and processes from preserves in countries like Bolivia and Micronesia. Carbon impact notwithstanding, such far-flung collaborations have become increasingly popular among designers who are wary of the perils of mass-market globalism, and who see both ecological and economic benefits in handcrafted goods. Here are six designers who are finding inspiration outside the borders of industrial production. [?][?][?]MONICA KHEMSUROV."

Throughout Northern California, devotees talk about the dinnerware as if the pieces were heirlooms — and certainly they’re durable enough to span generations — while dozens of area restaurants serve their locally grown sunchokes on Heath plates. (There is even a Heath Chez Panisse collection.) And in the last few years, under energetic new ownership, Heath has not only expanded and updated its product lines but also begun to invite other, like-minded companies to its table, all of which are committed to making products in an environmentally sound, aesthetically glorious way."
2008-09-28T00:00:00Z,"In this economy, the idea of an artist being able to afford work space in central London is basically a joke. Unless you’re lucky enough to know the Foxcrofts, that is. About a year ago, Auro Foxcroft, a furniture designer, and his brother, Jack, a photographer, had four retired subway cars hoisted onto the roof of a warehouse in the über-hip Shoreditch neighborhood in London and rented them out as offices for creative types for a mere £33 (about $60) a week. The Foxcrofts, who call their enterprise Village Underground, bought the Tube cars for about £100 ($180) from London transport authorities, then gutted and renovated them with the help of several friends and local engineers and architects. Two of the cars now sit atop open-sided steel shipping containers, which also serve as offices. The brothers also opened a multimedia cultural space inside the warehouse, which they rent out to corporate clients like Sony. Tenants — who love the views, not to mention the cachet — include fashion designers, painters and filmmakers as well as graffiti artists who regularly redecorate the cars in zebra stripes, camouflage and pixelated patterns. The Foxcrofts are planning a similar project in Berlin and are even looking into sites in the United States. Who else, they ask, is going to look out for artists in this money-hungry world?

2008-09-28T00:00:00Z,"It used to be said that you’re never really rich unless you owe a million dollars, which seems like such a quaint figure today, but by that measure Michael Taylor was very rich indeed. Despite his immense success as the quintessential California decorator of the ’70s and ’80s, Taylor died (of AIDS, in 1986, at the age of 59) more than $3 million in debt. Translated to today, the amount doubles. An 18th-century 32-tread marble staircase, gathering dust in a warehouse for almost 20 years, may have had something to do with it. So might Taylor’s habit, when in Paris, of sending his clothes round-trip to a Chicago dry cleaner. Then there were the monthlong stays every Christmas with his mother in a corner suite at the Royal Hawaiian hotel in Honolulu.

These paper-thin, superflexible panels are already being used in things like television and cellphone screens, but the lighting designer Ingo Maurer, known for his angelic flying light bulbs and chandeliers festooned with either broken plates or love notes, is the first to apply the technology to domestic lighting. Maurer was recently commissioned by the German company Osram Opto Semiconductors to play around with the possibilities of this new light source. His sleek table lamp, Early Future (above), which looks like an old-fashioned television antenna fitted with solar panels, is being produced by Osram in a limited edition. (A larger, suspended light, called Flying Future, which looks like a flying carpet circa 2099, is for the time being only a one-off.) OLED’s give off a white light that is less harsh, more uniform and more energy efficient than fluorescent light, and is said to be the closest simulation of actual sunlight. The panels can be made in large transparent sheets, so the next step, according to sources at Osram, would be to develop entire windows or skylights that let in the natural light by day and light up at night.

He was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on October 25, 1933 and will be missed greatly by many especially those in the architectural community where he was noted for his contemporary style, and recognized as a spokesman and educator in the environmental design community. In four decades of practice, he established a reputation for design excellence with work that was award-winning and widely published. He was known for bridging the realms of architecture, planning and landscape. He was a recognized authority in prefabricated housing and industrialized building and will always be remembered as a pioneer in that field. His large-scale projects included master planning of new towns, campuses and theme parks around the world. In addition, he sustained an involvement with local commissions and advisory boards while continuing to serve ad-hoc as a teacher, critic, and speaker. He received a degree in architecture from Yale University and a graduate degree in urban planning from Harvard University. He was a Fulbright scholar and served in the US Armed Forces. He leaves behind his former wife Wendy Wilson, his two beloved daughters, Jessica Jayne and Arabella Ezralow, son-in-law Daniel Ezralow, grandson Elijah Ezralow, brother Charles Holzbog and sister-in-law Margaret Holzbog and other family and friends. He was a devoted father, grandfather and brother. He was an active sportsman who loved his weekly tennis matches with his friends and loved swimming, especially with his grandson. He will be dearly missed by his family, friends and all of the hearts he touched. Memorial services pending."
2008-09-28T00:00:00Z,"GETTING away from the trappings of civilization has always been one of hiking's great allures, along with the possibility of a dramatic payoff in wildlife sightings and sweeping views. But keeping the region's hiking areas away from those trappings is often complicated. The one major requirement of hiking is open space, and lots of it, a commodity in ever-decreasing supply across the suburbs. Throughout the region, residents have either donated undeveloped land to a public trust or joined together to convince local governments that sometimes a parcel of natural beauty is worth saving for its own sake. What follow are suburban hiking areas that were created through the past and present efforts of these preservationists."

China plans a space station by 2020 and, eventually, a Moon landing.

2008-09-28T00:00:00Z,"GETTING away from the trappings of civilization has always been one of hiking's great allures, along with the possibility of a dramatic payoff in wildlife sightings and sweeping views. But keeping the region's hiking areas away from those trappings is often complicated. The one major requirement of hiking is open space, and lots of it, a commodity in ever-decreasing supply across the suburbs. Throughout the region, residents have either donated undeveloped land to a public trust or joined together to convince local governments that sometimes a parcel of natural beauty is worth saving for its own sake. What follow are suburban hiking areas that were created through the past and present efforts of these preservationists."

Born October 5, 1920, to Greta and Williams Rutherford in Deming, New Mexico, Mr. Rutherford spent his younger years moving throughout the West, attending high school at New Mexico Military Institute. He moved to San Diego in 1941, having completed training at Art Center in Pasadena as a photographer. During World War II, he worked for Consairways as a celestial navigator delivering planes from San Diego to the troops in the South Pacific. In 1943 he married Anna Gwyn Foster Dearing of Coronado, California. After the War, Mr. Rutherford attended Stanford University, completing an AB in Economics and Accounting (Phi Beta Kappa) and a JD from the Stanford Law School. He joined Ryan Aeronautical, San Diego, in the legal department, but was almost immediately promoted to Assistant Controller, and then Manager of the newly formed Electronics Division. Over the next 20 years, Mr. Rutherford took on increasingly complex management responsibility. By 1969, when Teledyne acquired Ryan Aeronautical, Mr. Rutherford was appointed Vice President and Group Executive of Teledyne Inc., responsible for up to 25 companies of the Teledyne Pacific Group. At his retirement in 1989, this sector of Teledyne produced sales of $1.4 billion from its aerospace, electronics and heavy manufacturing companies. Those who worked with him believed Mr. Rutherford to be a pioneer in the art of group management a brilliant, creative and imaginative businessman who could coordinate disparate companies and produce profitable results year after year. He was wellknown for his commitment to the people who worked for him, and was admired as a leader, a teacher, and an innovator. Many businessmen and women around the world considered Bill Rutherford their mentor and friend. His creative approach to problem solving, and his vision of excellence inspired all who had the privilege of his company. As a lifelong Episcopalian, Mr. Rutherford brought his considerable management talent and passion to the Church. He served on boards of schools and vestries of churches, always encouraging those in leadership positions to step out in faith. Mr. Rutherford is survived by his son, Dr. George Williams Rutherford III of Piedmont, CA, his daughter, the Rev. Amanda Rutherford May of San Diego, his step-daughter, Mrs. Alexandra Waits of El Cajon, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His wife of 60 years, Anna Gwyn Rutherford died in 2004, and his son Timothy Christopher Rutherford died in 2007.

2008-09-28T00:00:00Z,"LAMPTON--Dinwiddie, Jr. lived life with a flourish, particularly when driving his own coach, lines of four horses in hand. His hard work at American Life, the company his father started in 1906, lasted consistently for 40 years. Many of his employees stayed with the company forty years or more. His longterm thinking has been a benefit to the company. The motto he created, ''Be wise, be insured'' announced by coaching horn, proved beneficial to company identity. His personal motto was ''whip and kick and don't give up, you've got an eternity to rest.'' He graduated from Culver Military Academy, attended St. John's College in Annapolis, MD. In 1935, his father recalled him to Louisville to work at the company because Dinwiddie Sr. was very ill. He was the first to say he learned on the job. As a boy, he showed saddlebreds, as a young man competed in polo, then raced over jumps in steeplechases, raced on the flat in the original ''Gentlemen'' races at Churchill Downs, and ended with 30 years of driving horses to an array of vehicles, mostly 19th century rolling stock. He was a member of the American Carriage Association, The Coaching Club, and the Metropolitan Club in NYC. It was there he swung four horses and a carriage through the original coaching turnaround at 60th and Fifth Avenue. Club staff came out protesting, ''You can't do that!'' answered by ''But I just did!'' For 39 years he was married to Nancy Houghland from Nashville, TN. He and his family helped make the Hardscuffle Steeplechase a noteworthy race meet. His second marriage was to Elizabeth Whitcomb Brown who also drove horses to carriages. She was killed in March 2008 in a driving accident with carriage and four horses. As a young man, he was initiated into Masonry, and is a 33rd degree member of the Scottish Rite, The Royal Order of Scotland, the Red Cross of Constantine, Kosair Shrine, York Rite Commandery and the Military Order of World Wars. He served on the Regional Board of the Salvation Army and as Director of Citizens Fidelity Bank from 1965-1975. As a believer in saving land, he bought several farms for the company in perpetuity, including ''Elmendorf' in Lexington, KY, ''Beechdale'' in Pennsylvania, and ''Hardscuffle'' in Kentucky. He is survived by his sons, Dinwiddie Lampton, III, married to Irene de Boor; Mason H. Lampton married to Mary Lucile Hardaway; and a daughter, Nana Lampton; his sister Mary Jane Lampton Peabody married to Royden Peabody, II; grandchildren, Mary Wendell Lampton of Virginia Beach, VA; Mason Hardaway Lampton, married to Suzanna Lott, of Columbus, GA; and Lucile Lampton Cogswell, married to William Cogswell of Charleston, SC; as well as five great-grandchildren. A funeral service will be held at 1:00pm on Monday, September 29 at The Olmsted at the Masonic Home, 3701 Frankfort Avenue, Louisville, KY with burial to follow in Cave Hill Cemetery. Visitation will be on Monday from 11:30am until time of service. Pearsons, 149 Breckenridge Lane, in charge of services. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the Salvation Army, Culver Military Academy, The Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation, or the, Carriage Museum of America at the KY Horse Park."

2008-09-28T00:00:00Z,"GEORGES ROUSSE Equal parts illusion, installation and graffiti, the work of the Paris-based artist Georges Rousse is never quite what it seems. Rousse painted this issue's T (Page 117; another version appears above) in pieces on the floor, staircase, window and walls of an abandoned building, his canvas du jour. (It comes together as a ''T'' when you look at it dead-on.) For a man who exhibits his work all over the globe -- he currently has a show up at the Johyun Gallery in Seoul; an exhibition at the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Rosario in Argentina goes up in November -- it's no surprise that his ideas come from scattered sources. (Two examples of his work are shown at left.) ''I am inspired by my travels all around the world and the contact with different countries and their cultures,'' he says. But for Rousse, fragmentation is paradoxically a great catalyst for unity. ''I am looking for something like a universal language.''"

2008-09-28T00:00:00Z,"GETTING away from the trappings of civilization has always been one of hiking's great allures, along with the possibility of a dramatic payoff in wildlife sightings and sweeping views. But keeping the region's hiking areas away from those trappings is often complicated. The one major requirement of hiking is open space, and lots of it, a commodity in ever-decreasing supply across the suburbs. Throughout the region, residents have either donated undeveloped land to a public trust or joined together to convince local governments that sometimes a parcel of natural beauty is worth saving for its own sake. What follow are suburban hiking areas that were created through the past and present efforts of these preservationists."

When I was at Barnard College in Manhattan, I used to go to Tom's Restaurant for coffee, and after I graduated I also ate there before going to work. It was then a cheap, greasy place on 112th Street and Broadway, and it still is, in spite of its celebrity. And yes, it is the same one they use in the ''Seinfeld'' credits -- the neon sign that says ''Restaurant.'' I actually once saw Jerry Seinfeld right near there! The melody hit me as I was walking down Broadway, fast. I wanted something jaunty. I remember liking the near-rhymes of ''diner'' and ''corner,'' ''sitting'' and ''waiting.'' Although it is actually Tom's Restaurant I changed it to ''diner'' as it sings better."

There, she met and befriended many of the great painters of the day. She returned to New York and married Edward Lasker on February 1, 1935. They divorced ten years later.

Caral and Hank spent most of their marriage in Cleveland, Ohio where Caral pursued her passion for equestrian sports and Hank served as part owner and general manager of the Cleveland Indians baseball team. They divorced in 1959 and both moved back to New York, where Caral lived for the remainder of her life. In 1962, Caral married Joseph Lebworth with whom she spent the next 46 years in New York City, up until his death in May of this year. Caral began her equestrian career early and was riding competitively by the age of 14. She competed in hunting and jumping, both in the U.S. and abroad. She rode several times in Madison Square Garden at the National Horse Show and won numerous ribbons and trophies. Caral often rode in a hunt team with her mother and twin sister, Hope Solinger. While an accomplished painter in her youth, she gave up making art in favor of collecting it. She was a strong patron of the arts and supported many organizations such as Plays for Living, the Museum of Modern Art and Independent Curators International.

2008-09-29T00:00:00Z,"The Ravens and the Steelers probably had no intention of relying on their first-round picks so early, but circumstances changed the thinking on each side. Baltimore turned to quarterback Joe Flacco when Kyle Boller (shoulder) and Troy Smith (infection) were not ready to start the season. The Steelers' top pick, running back Rashard Mendenhall, will start in place of Willie Parker (sprained knee). So Mendenhall and Flacco each has an opportunity, but it is hard to call it an enviable one. Mendenhall will be facing Baltimore's top-ranked defense. Flacco will be staring at the league's second-ranked unit insecure in the knowledge that the Steelers' ability to stop the run (64.3 yards a game) will put even more pressure on his passing. He has produced two wins but below-average numbers (258 yards passing and a 55.7 rating)."

Caral began her equestrian career early and was riding competitively by the age of 14. She competed in hunting and jumping, both in the U.S. and abroad. She rode several times in Madison Square Garden at the National Horse Show and won numerous ribbons and trophies. Caral often rode in a hunt team with her mother and twin sister, Hope Solinger.

Another tries to limit her keepers to cool photography books.) What I'm left with amounts to a personal canon of sorts, an idiosyncratic collection of the books I turn to again and again and that have formed the foundation for my reading life.

There, she met and befriended many of the great painters of the day. She returned to New York and married Edward Lasker on February 1, 1935. They divorced ten years later.

They divorced in 1959 and both moved back to New York, where Caral lived for the remainder of her life. In 1962, Caral married Joseph Lebworth with whom she spent the next 46 years in New York City, up until his death in May of this year. Caral began her equestrian career early and was riding competitively by the age of 14. She competed in hunting and jumping, both in the U.S. and abroad. She rode several times in Madison Square Garden at the National Horse Show and won numerous ribbons and trophies. Caral often rode in a hunt team with her mother and twin sister, Hope Solinger. While an accomplished painter in her youth, she gave up making art in favor of collecting it.

The couple had relocated from Brooklyn, NY, Aaron's birthplace, upon his retirement in 2005. Born October 22, 1915, Aaron became an educator, philosopher, writer, actuary and idealist. A passionate believer in the dual concepts of justice for all and equality of opportunity without regard to race or gender, he was active in the early civil rights movement. Long before Dr. King put beautiful words to his dream, Aaron was communicating a vision of our country as a living example to the world; a nation where each citizen's potential would be valued and fulfilled. A Purser in the Merchant Marine during World War II and its aftermath, Aaron served with honor. That exposure to other cultures and attitudes helped shape the direction of his life. While his facility for language did not extend to expertise in accent or syntax, he made himself understood; the many friendships forged in his travels endured for decades. Blessed with humor and a quick wit, he delighted in challenging young people with word puzzles involving logic and math. Many now credit Aaron for inspiring them to career paths in science and law. Non-violent by nature, Aaron was deeply troubled by the disposition of cases such as Sacco-Vanzetti. He later became an expert on the trail and conviction of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, offended by the unprecedented peacetime death sentence he believed to be a politicallymotivated assault on the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution and Bill of Rights. Aaron served as Director of the National committee to reopen the Rosenberg Case for over 30 years. His lectures and discussion groups at Brooklyn College were popular and he continued the presentations well into his 80s. Aaron will be greatly missed by his wife, daughter, grand and greatgrandchildren, uncle/aunt, cousins, in-laws, nieces/nephews and others whose lives he touched. Services and burial will be private.

2008-09-30T00:00:00Z,"YEAGER--Paul S . The Trustees of the Columbia University Club Foundation mourn the loss of their Secretary and fellow Trustee, Paul S. Yeager. We will miss his longtime friendship and wise counsel. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Joann, and his family. YEAGER--Phillip C., 80, the founder and Chairman of one of the nation's largest freight transportation companies, died on September 29, 2008 from complications from a heart attack. Mr. Yeager, an intermodal industry pioneer, founded Hub Group with his late wife Joyce in 1971. Working together as a team, the two built a company that started in a windowless one room office above a flower shop and is today a publicly traded Fortune 1000 corporation with over $1.8 billion in annual sales. Mr. Yeager was born in Bellevue, Kentucky in 1927 and grew up in a working class family during the Great Depression. He worked in his family's butcher shop at a young age, earning a nickel or a doughnut for each delivery. Mr. Yeager learned the value of hard work and thrift during these formative years, character traits that would define his life. After excelling at sports in high school, Mr. Yeager attended the University of Cincinnati on an athletic scholarship, playing both football and tennis at the collegiate level. He was drafted in the Army in 1946 and served at Camp Carson in Colorado for 18 months. After a brief stint managing an ice house, Mr. Yeager began working for the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1952. He worked for the railroad for 19 years, witnessing the introduction of intermodal transportation in 1954. At that time, intermodal service, which combines the use of truck and rail transportation, was in its infancy. Realizing the potential of this new and more fuel efficient form of transportation, Mr. Yeager started Hub Group with his wife Joyce by his side and $500 in cash. With his strong relationships at the railroads and his reputation for honesty, customers began shipping with Hub Group in impressive numbers. The Company began a geographic expansion and had locations in over 25 important rail cities by 1985. Hub Group went public in 1996 and is currently traded on NASDAQ under the symbol HUBG. Mr. Yeager remained an active Chairman, company spokesman and industry advocate up to the time of his death. During his career Mr. Yeager received numerous awards recognizing his contributions to the transportation industry, including the Intermodal Transportation Association's Man of the Year, the Salzburg Practitioners Award from Syracuse University, the Presidential Medal from Dowling College, induction into the Chicago Area Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame, the Silver Kingpin award from the Intermodal Association of North America, the New York Traffic Club's Transportation Person of the Year, Target's Vice President's Life Time Achievement Award and the Connie Award from the Containerization and Intermodal Institute. Mr. Yeager also received an honorary Doctor of Public Service degree from the University of Denver in recognition of his achievements in the intermodal industry. Despite his tremendous accomplishments, he was a down to earth person who never lost the common touch. Mr. Yeager is survived by his wife Anne, daughter Debra (Bob) Jensen and his two sons David (Julia) and Mark (Heather), grandchildren Patrick Jensen, Elizabeth (Jim) Cassaro, Matthew, Phillip, Laura, Alexander, Samantha Yeager and two great grandchildren, Mia and Tyler Cassaro. Visitation for Mr. Yeager will take place Wednesday, October 1, from 5:008:00pm at Gibbons Elliston Funeral Home located at First and Grant Street, Hinsdale, IL 60521. Family and friends will meet Thursday, October 2 at St. John of the Cross, 5005 S. Wolf Road, Western Springs, IL 60558 for a 10:00am memorial service. In lieu of flowers, memorials made to Childrens Memorial Hospital, 2300 Childrens Plaza, Box 4 Chicago, IL 60614-3363 directed to ''The Yeager Professorship in Pediatric Neurosurgery'' would be appreciated."

Bay Area residents can consult an exhaustive catalog of local resources. For the rest of us there is the clinic's ''Dr. K,'' whose advice columns reveal, for example, that two condoms are not better protection than one."
2008-09-30T00:00:00Z,"The vote count during parliamentary elections in Belarus on Sunday was not as open as promised, and the election generally failed to meet European democratic standards, said the election monitoring agency of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. In a statement released Monday, the agency said independent observers were often denied access to polling stations. When access was provided, it said, observers reported cases of deliberate falsification of results. The agency said opposition candidates did have less difficulty holding demonstrations and greater access to television than in previous elections in Belarus, a country often described as Europe's last dictatorship."

As a classroom teacher, I can put this in perspective for them by showing them how they did without crushing their spirits. In other words, the raw percentage is not what I put into the computerized grade program. Let me explain why."

2008-10-01T00:00:00Z,"McCARTHY--Daniel J. Famous in Actuarial Circles, Dead at 70. Daniel J. McCarthy, Jr., noted actuary and former President of the American Academy of Actuaries, died Friday in Manhattan after a very brief illness. He was 70. The cause was stomach cancer. For years, Dan had a New Yorker cartoon in his office that showed a man at a cocktail party trying to impress someone by claiming to be famous if one happened to travel in actuarial circles. Dan was, in fact, famous in actuarial circles as a leader in the field who did much to advance the profession and to serve the insurance industry as a whole. Dan started his career at Equitable Life, where he was asked to try his hand at becoming an actuary. He at first had no idea what an actuary was, but agreed to give it a try. Years later, he taught his children that actuaries ''predict the present financial implications of future contingent events.'' It's no surprise that his six children all went on to professions that were easier to describe. After the Equitable, Dan joined Milliman & Robertson, now Milliman, Inc., which is among the worlds largest independent actuarial and consulting firms with 48 offices around the world. He served as Chairman of the firm for seven years, was President of the American Academy of Actuaries, spent six years as a member of the Actuarial Standards Board, was on the board of the Society of Actuaries, and served as the first International Secretary of the American Academy of Actuaries, traveling all over the world to represent the U.S. actuarial profession at many international organizations. In recent years, he served as Chairman of The Actuarial Foundation, a philanthropic group whose mission is to serve the public by developing education and research programs that harness the talents of actuaries. Dan was also known for advising countless other actuaries, generously sharing his experience with them one-on-one and through his public speaking. In trying to get a handle on what her dad did, one of his daughters once asked Dan what it looked like when he was done with a job. ''It's generally a report that presents an idea,'' he told her. She asked, ''What happens if an idea doesnt come to you?'' He was amused and answered, ''So far, one always has.'' He developed a specialty in demutualization, a term that refers to companies that are customer-owned mutual organizations becoming shareholder - owned stock companies. Dan was involved at various levels in demutualizing over 20 companies. He was referred to by The Life Insurance Council of New York as a ''giant in the insurance industry'' and as an ''extraordinary champion of the actuarial profession'' by the current President of the Academy of Actuaries, Bill Bluhm, who also wrote, ''He was an amazing individual, blessed with a first-rate mind, a great heart, and a vibrant personality. Anyone who ever worked with Dan understood what a pleasure it was to be part of whatever team he was leading. He was a consummate leader, one whose enthusiasm for his profession for life in general was infectious and inspiring.'' Dan never did run out of ideas. Even a brilliant actuary could not have predicted exactly when his own life would end, but he and his family spent a wonderful August together at their vacation home on Lake Winnepesaukee, where he played tennis and golf, went swimming and kayaking, and, probably his favorite activity, took his grandchildren for motorboat rides to get ice cream cones. Dan is survived by his wife of 49 years, the former Virginia Miller, of Aberdeen, NJ and Moultonborough, NH, his children, Deirdre Gelinne of Westfield, NJ, Daniel III of Laconia, NH, Justin of Farmingdale, NJ, Anne Knight of Hopkinton, NH, Judith of Summit, NJ, and Elizabeth of Manhattan, 15 grandchildren, and his sister, Elizabeth Daly, of DeWitt, NY. A funeral mass will be held today at 10am at St. Benedict Roman Catholic Church in Holmdel. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in Dans memory at http:// mercyfirst.org/.

To date, Pennrose has developed more than 10,000 affordable apartments.

2008-10-01T00:00:00Z,"When Michael Lewis's book ''The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game'' came out in 2006, it brought a lot of attention to the position of left tackle and gave fans a glimpse of how important offensive line play is to success in the N.F.L. This season, it seems a few quarterbacks are determined to prove that they can be successful even if they spend most of the game picking mud out of their face masks. Of the six quarterbacks who have been sacked 11 or more times, four have quarterback ratings of 90 or above. J. T. O'Sullivan, right, the first-year starter of the 49ers, has been put down a league-high 19 times for a combined loss of 98 yards and is on pace to tie David Carr's season record of 76 sacks set in 2002. Despite that, he has a respectable rating of 90, and his team is off to a somewhat surprising 2-2 start."

2008-10-01T00:00:00Z,"Rice cookers are usually sold with a plastic measuring cup that holds about three-quarters of an American cup. It is the size of the traditional Japanese tool for measuring rice: the masu, a wooden box sometimes used for drinking cold sake. ''Measuring seems to be the most difficult part for our American buyers,'' said Marilyn Matsuba, the American marketing manager for Zojirushi, the company that sells the most rice cookers in Japan. She said cooks can use the same proportions as when cooking rice in a pot. A ratio of two cups liquid to one cup long-grain rice will work; for short-grain rice, the ratio of water to rice is about one and a quarter cup to one cup. An Asian measuring method is surprisingly reliable: with the tip of the index finger resting on the top of the rice, add water until it rises just above the first knuckle. A rice cooker can accommodate easygoing approaches to measurement, because its long steam bath evens the texture of the rice. JULIA MOSKIN"

2008-10-01T00:00:00Z,"This two-minute advertisement by Senator Barack Obama's media team features him speaking directly into the camera. THE SCRIPT Mr. Obama says: ''For eight years, we've been told that the way to a stronger economy was to give huge tax breaks to corporations and the wealthiest Americans, and somehow prosperity would trickle down. Well, now we know the truth. It didn't work. Instead of prosperity trickling down, pain has trickled up. Working-family incomes have fallen by $2,000 a year. We're losing jobs. Deficits are exploding. Our economy's in turmoil. I know that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. But not by driving down the very same path. And that's what this election's all about. On taxes, John McCain and I have very different ideas. Instead of giving hundreds of billions in new tax breaks to big corporations and oil companies, I'll cut taxes for small and startup businesses that are the backbone of our economy. Instead of more tax breaks for corporations that outsource American jobs, I'll give them to companies who create jobs here. Instead of extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest, I'll focus on you. My plan offers three times as much tax relief to the middle class as Senator McCain's. If you make less than a quarter- million a year, you won't see your taxes raised one penny under my plan. And seniors making less than 50,000, who are struggling with the rising costs of food and drugs on fixed incomes, won't pay income taxes at all. The tax code we have today is over 10,000 pages long. Almost every bit of it was shaped by some lobbyist taking care of some special interest. Well, it's time we had a president who puts you first. I hope you'll log on to BarackObama.com and read my full plan. It will help jump-start our economy, create millions of jobs and bring back our Main Streets all across America. The old trickle-down theory has failed us. We can't afford four more years like the last eight. I'm Barack Obama, and I approved this message because I know that with a new direction and new policies focused on jobs and the middle class, we can lift our economy and our country.''"

On Wednesday pedestrians and bloggers were abuzz that a new mural project going up in SoHo was the handiwork of Banksy, the pseudonymous street artist. The mural, depicting what appeared to be a rat toting an umbrella, seemed to repeat a motif seen in another mural recently painted on a wall at Grand and Wooster Streets, that of a rat in an ''I -- NY'' T-shirt. That work was believed to be a collaboration between Banksy and the outdoor advertising company Colossal Media, which put up both murals and had no comment on Banksy's involvement. David Choe, an artist represented by Lazarides Galleries, which also handles Banksy's art, identified the murals as Bansky's.

Like running, jumping rope is easy to learn. But, said Carol Espel, an exercise physiologist and the national director of group fitness for Equinox, ''it has the added benefits of working the upper body and being easier on the knees.'' New jump-ropes with digital calorie counters underscore how the activity has moved beyond child's play. Improved ball bearings and heavier ropes make for a tougher workout, with faster rope rotations. Some handles are made weightier to challenge arms and shoulders. And some jump-ropes don't even have ropes."

Yet it felt drivingly contemporary, with the emphasis on prints based on animals, wood grains, crushed crystals, skeletons, and mechanical shapes like the Eiffel Tower.

A paper by Peter J. Wallison and Charles W. Calomiris of the American Enterprise Institute explains the creation, evolution and fall of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Willing to take on every challenge with a big smile and an open mind, whether the whims of his wife or the needs of his children. Intrepid adventurer to any exotic spots-whether wild or tamed, as much at home in the jungle as on the Boulevards. Enthusiastic sportsman both as participant or observer, connoisseur of fine wines and great foods, classy dresser, philanthropist, leader at spas, meetings, excursions, conventions. He was a brilliant financier bending every effort to share his ideas, his acumen and his intelligent analyst with those who can profit by it. He was a good and loyal friend, a person you wanted to be with and someone you would not easily forget. He gave many young people great training and a chance to grow, and enabled many to make satisfying careers for themselves. His wife, D'Vera, his children: Clifford and his wife Robin; Gail and her Tom Mandel; Martha and her husband David Kirby as well was his seven grandchildren; Matthew, Michael, Maple, Rachel, Graham, Ruby and Cooper will miss him everyday from now on.

Had we known that teaching evaluations at Wesleyan would be used as a club to terrorize faculty members on short-term appointments, we would have thrown up our hands in horror.

As school psychologist for the London County Council from 1913 to 1932, Burt claimed that only 20 percent of British children were intelligent enough to be routed to university. Thus he reinforced the British class system by denying higher education to all but that handful. This began to change only when the Labor Party came to power after World War II. Interestingly, although some of his other work was stellar, Burt was exposed as a fraud who manipulated findings about the relation between class and intelligence. Murray’s “Bell Curve” (1994) was exactingly critiqued by Stephen Jay Gould for its methodological and philosophical shortcomings. That our nation grievously undereducates its children may in part be traced to Murray’s ideas."

(''We were also having an affair,'' he noted). Indeed, those were wonderfully decadent days, as is evident by the images: Huston, riding on a motorbike behind the photographer Oliviero Toscani in Milan, her Missoni cape flying in the wind; lounging in a hotel room in Nice with Manolo Blahnik (then a fledging footwear designer), fresh orchids in her hair; posing with Yves Saint Laurent in his Paris apartment; with ornate fans at Karl Lagerfeld's house; on horseback at Jean Shrimpton's family farm; and sprawled on a hotel floor with Bailey, his head in her lap.

Something was always happening at 4 Tallwood Road in Jacksonville Beach: someone painting, recording a song or cooking a vegan dinner. It began in 2000, with Jeremie Faircloth and E. J. Baker, both now 28, local kids with artistic aspirations who wanted a beach house. Over the years, a good dozen creative types cycled in and out of the ramshackle four-bedroom home. This summer, 4 Tallwood broke up. The landlord decided to sell, and the last assortment of five bohemians moved on. ''This has been a haven for us,'' Faircloth said, ''a haven for our creativity. It's really sad.'' ITINERANT ARTISTS"

Willing to take on every challenge with a big smile and an open mind, whether the whims of his wife or the needs of his children.

Enthusiastic sportsman both as participant or observer, connoisseur of fine wines and great foods, classy dresser, philanthropist, leader at spas, meetings, excursions, conventions. He was a brilliant financier bending every effort to share his ideas, his acumen and his intelligent analyst with those who can profit by it. He was a good and loyal friend, a person you wanted to be with and someone you would not easily forget. He gave many young people great training and a chance to grow, and enabled many to make satisfying careers for themselves. His wife, D'Vera, his children: Clifford and his wife Robin; Gail and her Tom Mandel; Martha and her husband David Kirby as well was his seven grandchildren; Matthew, Michael, Maple, Rachel, Graham, Ruby and Cooper will miss him everyday from now on.

BEHIND THE NEWS Efforts by central banks before the vote to loosen up straitened credit markets with big injections of cash fell flat, so when the bill's defeat becomes clear, stock markets spiral downward; the Dow industrials fall nearly 7 percent, their worst day in decades. The defeat reflects broad public anger over the rescue package, which is criticized as an undeserved bailout of Wall Street high-flyers. House Republicans, in particular, defy their leaders to vote no."

But the P.R. agency for Dr. Siegal's Cookie Diet has stepped in to remind us that cookies have long served as economic icons. A news release says that in the 1930s, chocolate chip cookies reportedly became popular after some chocolate accidentally fell into a bowl of sugar cookie dough, which was used anyway for reasons of Depression-era frugality. A more recent example of cookie resonance is the Cookie Monster from ''Sesame Street,'' whose voraciousness can be seen as a symbol of unchecked financial greed."

''I have to say I wasn't one of those traveler people at the beginning. I'm the youngest sibling, and I was always a family, home person. For such a long time I was focusing on trying to get into vet school. But then my place got deferred, so I was given a year to do whatever I liked. I spent 10 months on the subcontinent, working with street animal charities on and off, mostly in India, so it was half play and half working. People were very welcoming in Lahore -- more friendly, actually, than in India. The first thing that really hits you in Pakistan is having to be a lot more respectful to the culture, compared to India. Almost every traveler you meet wears local dress. It wasn't a pretentious thing to do, it just meant you were more likely to be spoken to and respected a little more because you're respecting them.'' As told to Austin Considine"

But by the late 1990s, in New York, if you weren't in the financial industry, it was hard to survive. And so it went throughout the country, in the whole winner-take-all-era ushered in by the boom years of the late 1990s. The model for success narrowed. The goal posts marking success grew more out of reach. For all the people who did something with their lives other than doggedly, single-mindedly -- and successfully -- pursue wealth, life got harder and scarier and more confusing."

2008-10-07T00:00:00Z,"The Wall Street the world knew seven months ago exists no more. Sparked by the bursting of the housing bubble last year, the seizing up of the credit markets has reshaped the financial landscape, felling decades-old investment banks and spurring the government into some of its most sweeping market interventions since the era of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Some of these companies, like Bear Stearns and the American International Group, were salvaged, though at great cost. Others, like Lehman Brothers, were not. Among these rescuers are some of the biggest names in finance, including chief executives like James Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. But overshadowing them all is the increasingly powerful trio of Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary; Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman; and Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We've linked the players to the deals they've worked on, illustrating the increasingly more complex web of financial rescue workers. Each deal is denoted with a different color. With little end to the credit crisis in sight, the list of bailouts may grow larger."

Noted Feminist Author, playwright, actor, teacher, lecturer and performer. Bluh's sharp, insightful nonfiction narrative of the emergence of the European feminist movement, ''Woman to Woman'' (1974), is a landmark account of the second wave of feminism and her book is used in classrooms across the world. Her popular, comic novel ''Banana'' (1976) is considered by some the first truly feminist novel ever to be published. Bluh (pronounced blue), as friends and family knew her, was brought up in Sunnyside Queens, had lived in cities from coast to coast as well as Israel and Spain, but always called New York City her home. Since 1985 Bluh had lived at the Westbeth Artists Community in the West Village. In a building filled with interesting artists of all stripes she was known as one of the more outgoing, colorful characters. She was as devoted to her family as she was to her writing. And she never stopped fighting for the great causes of her time. The world will be a poorer, paler place without her. Bluh is survived by her sons, Craig, Kenn, and Brian Lowy, Brian's wife Karen Ilardi-Lowy whom Bluh considered a daughter, two granddaughters, Allee and Mariah, and her devoted friend Mordechai.

2008-10-08T00:00:00Z,"BLUH--Bonnie, age 82, died suddenly in New York City on October 2, 2008. The cause was an aortic dissection. Noted Feminist Author, playwright, actor, teacher, lecturer and performer. Bluh's sharp, insightful nonfiction narrative of the emergence of the European feminist movement, ''Woman to Woman'' (1974), is a landmark account of the second wave of feminism and her book is used in classrooms across the world. Her popular, comic novel ''Banana'' (1976) is considered by some the first truly feminist novel ever to be published. Bluh (pronounced blue), as friends and family knew her, was brought up in Sunnyside Queens, had lived in cities from coast to coast as well as Israel and Spain, but always called New York City her home. Since 1985 Bluh had lived at the Westbeth Artists Community in the West Village. In a building filled with interesting artists of all stripes she was known as one of the more outgoing, colorful characters. She was as devoted to her family as she was to her writing. And she never stopped fighting for the great causes of her time. The world will be a poorer, paler place without her. Bluh is survived by her sons, Craig, Kenn, and Brian Lowy, Brian's wife Karen Ilardi-Lowy whom Bluh considered a daughter, two granddaughters, Allee and Mariah, and her devoted friend Mordechai.

2008-10-08T00:00:00Z,"PETERSEN--Elizabeth M.J.F., A doyen of Greenwich society, died October 2nd in Aurora, CO. She was 85 and is survived by five children, five grandchildren, and two greatgrandchildren. Betty was born in 1922 in Rye, NY, but her family soon relocated to London, where she lived until the age of nine. But her real home was Greenwich, CT, where her family permanently settled in 1931. Betty graduated from Madeira School in 1941 and Vassar College four years later. She maintained strong lifelong ties to both as a fund raiser and advisor. Shortly after college, she moved to New York where she worked at NBC. In 1948 she married William P. Jeffery, Jr., and returned to Greenwich, which remained her home for the next 57 years. Betty maintained a lifelong interest in education. While raising five children, she spent much of her life ministering to the learning disabled, and she was one of the original founders of the Greenwich Association for Retarded Children. At age 50 she enrolled at Manhattanville College, where she received not one but two advanced degrees in education. At age 55 she entered the Fairfield County and Westchester county school systems as a special education teacher, a role she continued to play until she was in her late seventies. Betty belonged to a myriad of local clubs and organizations, including the St. Barnabas Church choir, the Greenwich chapter of the DAR, the Bruce Museum, the Greenwich Garden Club, the Field Club of Greenwich, and the Round Hill Club. Her love of the outdoors and outdoor sports was unbounded. Tennis was her forte, but she was an accomplished skier well into her seventies. She will be remembered for her charisma, quick intelligence, her exuberant sense of humor, and her limitless intellectual and physical energy. A service in honor of Betty's life will be held at St. Barnabas Church in Greenwich, CT on Saturday, October 11th at 11am.

2008-10-09T00:00:00Z,"Chunks of granite crashed to the Yosemite Valley floor, injuring at least three people and destroying several cabins and trees at one of the park’s most popular lodging areas, officials said. The rock slide was the second in two days in the area called Curry Village, an area defined by dramatic sheer cliffs. The slide destroyed five cabins and partly damaged at least three others, according to a park statement. Three visitors were treated for minor injuries. The volume of rocks cascading from the granite face was estimated at about 1,800 cubic yards, or about 180 truckloads, said Vickie Mates, a park spokeswoman. There was a smaller slide in the same area on Tuesday. In 1996, a rock slide in the same area sent as much as 162,000 tons of rock plummeting more than 2,000 feet, killing one visitor and felling 500 trees. Curry Village, founded in 1899 in south-central Yosemite, has 610 canvas and wood cabins in rows among huge boulders, which geologists say are there because of prehistoric rock falls."

But yesterday's practice session, and now today's qualifying session, have shown just how close the performances are between the Formula One cars today. It's no good laughing at Force India as being an eternal tail-ender and way off the mark, when we know that although they finished last and second last in the first qualifying period, Adrian Sutil, in 19th place was only 1 second off Lewis Hamilton, in the fastest spot. Likewise, in the second qualifying period, David Coulthard missed the top 10 by .08 seconds, while Mark Webber in the other Red Bull, finished 13th by being less than .2 off his teammate. In the final qualifying period the top eight drivers were all within the same .6 of a second.This is all so insanely close when you really think about it, that it really makes you open your eyes about what the teams are achieving up and down the grid. How frustrating it must be for the teams at the back to know that they are only a second off the leaders. Remember the days of the six second differences?"

Watson, CEO and Chair, the Board of Directors and staff of EmblemHealth, the parent company of HIP Health Insurance Plan of New York and GHI, mourn the passing of Ronald Maiorana, a retired senior vice president of public affairs and a consultant to EmblemHealth at the time of his death. A former reporter for the New York Times and later press secretary and advisor to New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, he was 78 and died Thursday after a short illness at his home in East Quogue. Mr. Maiorana joined The Times as a copy boy in 1951 as a college freshman in night school and was promoted to reporter in 1955, covering a broad range of assignments in the New York metropolitan area and in Albany. He left The Times in 1968 to join Governor Rockefeller as an assistant press secretary. In 1969, the Governor appointed Mr. Maiorana as his press secretary and principal spokesperson. He accompanied the Governor on government and political trips across the nation and throughout South America. After Governor Rockefeller left office, Mr. Maiorana served as New York State Commissioner of Wagering Systems (1974-1975). He then joined the New York State Special Prosecutor for the Criminal Justice System as a director (1975-1976). He later worked with political consultants David Garth and Maureen Connelly on the U.S. Senate campaign of H. John Heinz of Pennsylvania and on all of Rudolph Giulianis campaigns for Mayor of New York City. He joined the administration of Mayor Giuliani as a senior advisor in 1994 and was appointed Commissioner of the New York City Community Assistance Unit in 1995. He left his city position to join HIP as a managing consultant for public affairs in 1996 and joined the health care company's executive staff full time in 1998. He retired April 30, 2007. At HIP, he was a trusted advisor to CEO Anthony L. Watson during a period of profound change in the firm, culminating with the affiliation with GHI to form EmblemHealth earlier this year. Mr. Maiorana also was a talented artist, an avocation he pursued for 60 years, opening his first exhibit AbstRactions in July. Two of his abstracts on canvas are in the Nelson Rockefeller collection. The EmblemHealth family extends its prayers and best wishes to Mr. Maiorana's family: his son Ronald Peter Maiorana and wife, Kelly Allman, and daughters Linda Catherine Williams and her husband Trevor Williams, and Janice Virginia Maiorana-Browne, and her husband Christopher Browne, and Mr. Maiorana's brother Victor and his wife, Rosalie. His wife, Phyllis, was killed accidentally when struck by a branch that fell from a tree on September 11, 2002. They had been married 47 years. In lieu of flowers, please make contributions to Little Flower Children and Family Services of Wading River, New York 11792. Friends may call Sunday from 2pm to 6pm at Fred H.

2008-10-12T00:00:00Z,"Two years ago, the New York City chef Christine Carroll was painting a New Orleans high school with a post-Katrina volunteer group when she realized that she was no painter. But she could cook; so could everyone she knew. And New Orleans needed nourishment. Once home, she started organizing CulinaryCorps, a charity that recruits squads of chefs and culinary students for weeklong trips to New Orleans, where they might be asked to cook dinner for a Habitat for Humanity crew one night and the still-stoveless residents of the Lower Ninth Ward the next. Mornings are spent volunteering: teaching elementary-school kids about growing vegetables or helping to recover flood-damaged cookbooks from venerated restaurants. The focus is not just on feeding the hungry but also on keeping the city's food traditions alive. ''We give them our version of shrimp and grits, and then when they come back for seconds, they share their secret family recipes,'' says Carroll. Of the 75 chefs who have gone through the program, two have moved to New Orleans to make culinary philanthropy -- or ''culanthropy'' -- a full-time project. Next year, Carroll says, she hopes to take her Sauciers Sans Frontières idea to places like Appalachia and Puerto Rico. ADAM FISHER"

2008-10-12T00:00:00Z,"An initiative in Chad and Darfur is taking the low-tech concept of solar cooking to a higher level. Run by Jewish World Watch, a coalition of Los Angelesarea synagogues founded in 2004 to address modern genocide, the Solar Cooker Project provides refugee-camp residents with the materials -- aluminum foil, cardboard and glue -- to build cookers.Thirty dollars covers the cost of two cookers, cloth potholders -- and training. Harnessing the sun's energy doesn't just mean fewer girls searching for firewood (often putting them at risk of being raped along the way) and fewer people suffering from the injuries associated with live-fire cooking; it also provides relief for the denuded Chadian and Sudanese countryside. The nearly-three-year-old project has supplied and trained more than 10,000 women and girls in the Iridimi and Touloum camps and recently began work with 28,000 residents of the Oure Cassoni camp. In Iridimi, trips to collect firewood have decreased by 86 percent. The program director, Rachel Andres, who was recently awarded the Charles Bronfman Prize for her work, says it's been successful ''because it's so simple,'' she said.

One of the participants in the conference, sponsored by Dow Jones and Nielsen, will be John S. Riccitiello, chief executive of the video game maker Electronic Arts. Interviewed last week, he said the industry was in ''an expanding period, driven by new technology, new platforms'' and wider adoption of broadband.

2008-10-12T00:00:00Z,"Last April, after winning a competition at the University of Wisconsin School of Business, Keith Agoada, who was then still a student, decided to turn his sustainable-urban-farming plan into a business and created Sky Vegetables. The concept takes advantage of the ''fields'' of flat rooftops found atop supermarkets by using that space to grow crops. Agoada says Sky Vegetables will have benefits beyond sustainable local produce. The plants and greenhouses will absorb sunlight, making it easier for supermarkets to cool their buildings; in the winter they will add insulation. And an heirloom tomato grown a few feet up from the aisle in which it's sold won't come with any guilt-inducing air miles. The farms will use rainwater for irrigation and solar panels for some of their energy needs. No greenhouses have been installed yet, but Agoada and his partner say they hope to begin construction on a prototype next year; they are currently talking to supermarkets in the Bay Area.

2008-10-12T00:00:00Z,"In April, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals offered $1 million to the first successful candidate to produce a commercially viable chicken product in a laboratory -- real chicken, but without killing a chicken. The idea isn't just science fiction. In 2005, the Dutch government gave a grant of 1.7 million euros to three universities to pursue ''in vitro'' meat research in the hope that a commercially acceptable product might come to replace slaughterhouses and feedlots. The basic science draws on the work of tissue engineers who have created skin and cartilage by cultivating stem cells in a growth medium. There are several technological obstacles to applying this to meat. The most cost-effective growth medium on the market at the moment is made from fetal calf's blood -- hardly animal friendly. And if the new cultivated meat cells are not properly stretched and stimulated -- mimicking muscle activity -- the resulting product has a stomach-churning consistency that one tissue scientist described as ''jelly on fabric.'' Oron Catts, a biologist and artist at the University of Western Australia, grew some small frog steaks in vitro several years ago and set up a performance-art piece where eight people sat down to have them for dinner. Four of the diners spat their portions out. Catts got his steak down, but he has been a vegetarian ever since. CHARLES WILSON"

As a member of the NYC PAL track team, her track highlights included being on the 1959 Pan American Team, representing the US in the 200 meters and setting an A.A.U. American Indoor record in the 440 yard run in 1960. Louise developed the New York State high school program for girls track in 1975, and in 1976 founded the Empire Track and Field Camp for Girls. She managed US teams, nationally and internationally, from 1978-1987. Louise was inducted into the Hunter College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1988.

2008-10-12T00:00:00Z,"Because of a condition called micronutrient malnutrition, the global food crisis, even if it eases soon, will have repercussions for decades to come. This so-called ''hidden hunger,'' which stems from a lack of vitamins and minerals in the diet, can leave children blind, permanently lower their I.Q.'s and make them targets for long-term illnesses and early death. Cheap, filling staples like maize, beans and cassava have long been mainstays of the poor, which is why the agricultural economist Howarth Bouis thought to breed micronutrients directly into those crops in the early '90s. Today HarvestPlus, the nonprofit that Bouis founded in 2003, operates in 50 countries and has plans to release seven ''biofortified'' crops within five years. ''Biofortification is really the last hope for the poorest of the poor,'' says Fil Randazzo, a senior program officer at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has contributed $38 million to HarvestPlus over the last five years. Bouis's idea is sowing seeds of change: just a few months ago, biofortification -- which is achieved through conventional breeding, though HarvestPlus devotes a fraction of its resources to research into genetic modification -- took the No. 5 slot at the Copenhagen Consensus, a meeting of economists that prioritizes solutions to global challenges based on a cost-benefit analysis.

2008-10-12T00:00:00Z,"In college, Severine von Tscharner Fleming's ''violent allergic reaction to L.A.'' drove her to help set up a guerrilla farming club, visit farmers on the West Coast in a vegetable-oil pickup truck and form the Society for Agriculture and Food Ecology at the University of California, Berkeley. Now von Tscharner Fleming, the child of urban planners from Cambridge, Mass., wants her peers to get dirty. ''Farming is an attractive path for people who are getting out of school and feeling like there's kind of a toxic consumerism and not feeling too excited about working for the Man, especially seeing as he's been spoiling our politics and a lot of our ecology,'' she said. She started serveyourcountryfood.net, an interactive map charting farmers under 40, and is making ''The Greenhorns,'' a documentary on ''organic entrepreneurs.'' ''I want to show how sweet and honest and brave and purposeful they are,'' she said of her subjects. With an office in the village of Red Hook and farmland she is renting in the Hudson River Valley, von Tscharner Fleming knows she needs to go beyond the field in order to effect real policy change: ''They're making some kind of sausage in Washington, and I felt like some young farmer flavor would be appropriate.'' Anna Lappé didn't know it when she read Bryant Terry's name in the ''Future 500,'' a who's-who of youth advocates and organizations, but she would end up writing a book with him. The pair, who were then neighbors in Brooklyn, published ''Grub: Ideas for an Urban Organic Kitchen'' in 2006 as a way to cool-ify healthful, local, sustainable food, with a side of social justice. It was an easy fit. Lappé is the daughter of Frances Moore Lappé, whose 1971 best seller, ''Diet for a Small Planet,'' changed how people thought about world hunger; the two created the Small Planet Institute in 2001 to foster what they call ''a living democracy.'' At that time, Terry -- moved by the fact that the inner-city children in his workshops ate the ''worst possible food'' -- founded b-healthy! to teach low-income children the importance of fresh food."

2008-10-12T00:00:00Z,"Beyond farmers' markets, beyond organic-everything, beyond the newly fashionable Victory Garden lies the eco-fringe: urban homesteading. The idea is to get off the grid while living in a city. There are two new books on the subject, Kelly Coyne and Erik Knutzen's how-to guide, ''The Urban Homestead,'' and Novella Carpenter's forthcoming ''FarmCity,'' a memoir. Home growing is a first step, but backyard livestock is the real aim: bees, quail, chickens, duck and rabbits. Foraging is the next frontier. Coyne and Knutzen encourage throwing seed balls (''the Molotov cocktail of the urban homesteader'') into vacant lots; viewing dumpsters as akin to fruit trees; and thinking of edible weeds as ''a very casual crop.'' Martha Stewart it's not. There is a radical vibe, and some of the most extreme practices -- composting your own waste into ''humanure'' for example -- are technically illegal. But the rest of it is home economics as our great-grandparents knew it: composting, canning, pickling, wild yeasts, mail-order seeds, brewing and even making moonshine"

With no membership fee, customers of Berkeley's Three Stone Hearth, which calls itself a community-supported kitchen, can buy as little or as much as they choose from a weekly changing menu of traditional, nutritious, homemade meals. Clients are invited to assist in the kitchen and to attend monthly farmers' dinners. For Jessica Prentice and her four Three Stone Hearth co-founders, ''there was a missing link between all the wonderful foods in a C.S.A. box and dinner on the table,'' Prentice said. ''Communities need farms, but they also need kitchens.'' JILL SANTOPIETRO (MM77)"

Some friends speak to me of the coming apocalypse -- financial collapse, dogs howling at the moon, the scorched earth of Mad Max and Cormac McCarthy. Others are sanguine, still play golf on the weekend and remain on cordial terms with their brokers. I don't know what the line is in Vegas. I'm here to learn. I had a plan, of course. I couldn't follow John Steinbeck's exact route, not with the price of gas and a miserly budget, but I could pinch out six weeks of travel and make it to San Francisco before the election. That meant shower knobs that break off in your hand and even the tyranny of franchise food, but I felt game for it. If the apocalypse is looming, it might be useful to adapt to Arby's and Nathan's Finest."
2008-10-12T00:00:00Z,"ANDORS--Irving. Born in Brooklyn only 44 years after the end of the Civil War, Irving died on October 9th, three days before his 99th birthday. His life encompassed the entire sweep of 20th Century history, and until his last year he continued to evince unflagging interest in the news about the tumultuous beginnings of the 21st. Starting his working life as a mechanic for the Mack Truck Company in the 1930s, he then founded his own printing business where he did many lithographs for the American artist William Gropper. Like millions in his generation he started his family in Brooklyn during the 1940s, then moved to the Long Island suburbs in the early 1950s and in the 1970s, retired and spent the remainder of his life in South Florida. He was a classical music lover and an avid tennis player, a successful businessman and a good boss. But most of all he was a sweet, kind, intelligent, stubborn man and a good father. His wife Gertrude and his youngest child Ellen predeceased him. He is survived by two sons; Stephen of Brooklyn Heights, NY and Leon of Pittstown, NJ, and by five grandchildren; Jessica, Andrea, Stefanie, Zachary and Nora."

2008-10-12T00:00:00Z,"The French say vines must suffer to make great wine. Stress from heat and lack of water helps produce concentrated flavors in grapes. Yet there's fear that many red-wine regions, which tend to be hot and dry already, will become too hot and dry with global warming. Now a vineyard in Jumilla, in southeast Spain, says it has found an irrigation technique to conserve water and make flavorful low-alcohol wines. ''We use less water,'' says Juan Manuel Gomez, agriculturalist of the Casa de la Ermita winery, ''and can create a product that might attract the consumer in a crowded market.'' Other vineyards employ drip-irrigation systems, which dole out water bit by bit. ''There's a worldwide effort to find ways to use water efficiently,'' says David Smart of the Viticulture and Enology Department at the University of California, Davis. Gomez says his vineyard has discovered a way to manage the timing, quantity and frequency of water to control sugar. Sugar converts to alcohol during fermentation; so less sugar in the grapes means lower alcohol. Altos de la Ermita, Gomez's wine, is around 6.5 percent alcohol, with help from a less-efficient fermentation and the application of an alcohol-removing machine. EDWARD LEWINE"

She imagined vertical produce on Skid Row in Los Angeles, free for the picking. Robin Osler of Elmslie Osler Architects in New York helped her vision bear fruit. In August, Urban Farming Food Chain walls were installed at two Skid Row homeless housing facilities, a nearby food bank and a high school, their clip-on trays preplanted with strawberries, peppers, lettuces and other edibles. The next goal is to design a mobile kitchen for cooking demonstrations. Osler sees the wall as something that can go up anywhere in the U.S. ''It's not using valuable horizontal real estate; it's not creating economic issues for a developer to battle against,'' she said.

2008-10-12T00:00:00Z,"MAIORANA--Ronald. Anthony L. Watson, CEO and Chair, the Board of Directors and staff of EmblemHealth, the parent company of HIP Health Insurance Plan of New York and GHI, mourn the passing of Ronald Maiorana, a retired senior vice president of public affairs and a consultant to EmblemHealth at the time of his death. A former reporter for the New York Times and later press secretary and advisor to New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, he was 78 and died Thursday after a short illness at his home in East Quogue. Mr. Maiorana joined The Times as a copy boy in 1951 as a college freshman in night school and was promoted to reporter in 1955, covering a broad range of assignments in the New York metropolitan area and in Albany. He left The Times in 1968 to join Governor Rockefeller as an assistant press secretary. In 1969, the Governor appointed Mr. Maiorana as his press secretary and principal spokesperson. He accompanied the Governor on government and political trips across the nation and throughout South America. After Governor Rockefeller left office, Mr. Maiorana served as New York State Commissioner of Wagering Systems (1974-1975). He then joined the New York State Special Prosecutor for the Criminal Justice System as a director (1975-1976). He later worked with political consultants David Garth and Maureen Connelly on the U.S. Senate campaign of H. John Heinz of Pennsylvania and on all of Rudolph Giulianis campaigns for Mayor of New York City. He joined the administration of Mayor Giuliani as a senior advisor in 1994 and was appointed Commissioner of the New York City Community Assistance Unit in 1995. He left his city position to join HIP as a managing consultant for public affairs in 1996 and joined the health care company's executive staff full time in 1998. He retired April 30, 2007. At HIP, he was a trusted advisor to CEO Anthony L. Watson during a period of profound change in the firm, culminating with the affiliation with GHI to form EmblemHealth earlier this year. Mr. Maiorana also was a talented artist, an avocation he pursued for 60 years, opening his first exhibit AbstRactions in July. Two of his abstracts on canvas are in the Nelson Rockefeller collection. The EmblemHealth family extends its prayers and best wishes to Mr. Maiorana's family: his son Ronald Peter Maiorana and wife, Kelly Allman, and daughters Linda Catherine Williams and her husband Trevor Williams, and Janice Virginia Maiorana-Browne, and her husband Christopher Browne, and Mr. Maiorana's brother Victor and his wife, Rosalie. His wife, Phyllis, was killed accidentally when struck by a branch that fell from a tree on September 11, 2002. They had been married 47 years.

In addition to vegetative waste and food-contaminated paper (like paper towels or plates), people will also be able to recycle meat and dairy products.The recycled waste will be used as compost for parks and gardens. By 2012, Seattle aspires to recycle 60 percent of its waste; up from the 48.7 percent of waste now diverted from the landfill.

The larger the battery pack, the bigger the subsidy. The law calls for a base credit of $2,500 for plug-in hybrid purchases, which increases by $417 for each kilowatt-hour of battery capacity over four kilowatt-hours, to a maximum of $7,500. So the Chevrolet Volt, scheduled to go on sale in late 2010 with a 16 kilowatt-hour pack, would presumably qualify for the full subsidy. Other vehicles with smaller packs, including a possible plug-in version of the Toyota Prius, would get a smaller credit even if the car had superior performance and range."

''You can't freeze or dry these onions, or they'll lose their texture and taste,'' says Burgerville's Jack Graves. Similarly, the blackberry milkshake -- made from fresh berries picked at Liepold Farms, in Boring, Ore. -- is available only from July to September, followed in the fall by limited-time sweet-potato fries.

It opened 100 years ago last Friday as a rich man's dream. As detailed in a new book, ''The Long Island Motor Parkway'' by Howard Kroplick and Al Velocci (Arcadia Publishing), the parkway ran about 45 miles across Long Island, from Queens to Ronkonkoma, and was created by William Kissam Vanderbilt II, the great-grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt."

BEHIND THE NEWS It was the type of day when a 369-point decline in the Dow came as a relief. The damage was worse abroad: Asian markets were hammered; the Russian market dropped 19 percent; major indexes in Europe lost from 7 percent to 9 percent of their value; and stocks in Latin America took their worst fall in a decade. The carnage reflected fears of a global recession. ''Everybody is going to get caught up in this,'' said one leading economist."

2008-10-12T00:00:00Z,"When bags of spinach contaminated with E. coli began poisoning diners in 26 states two years ago, it was more than a month before the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were able to trace the outbreak back to its source: Natural Selection Foods in San Juan Bautista, Calif. Frustrated with the faltering federal response and the spiraling hysteria that accompanied it, two social scientists at Michigan State University proposed a second resource for consumers: a ''mass collaboration'' Web site where sick diners could post their symptoms and food intake anonymously. Modeled after open-source information systems like Wikipedia and the illness map whoissick.org, the academics suggested in a paper last November that an anonymous symptom aggregator ''would provide more information, more quickly, and at finer geographic scales than is possible from government agencies.'' While Laura DeLind and Philip Howard, the authors, acknowledge that accuracy in such a system would be dependent on its participants, they say it could lessen the public's dependence on federal oversight and protect smaller farms not responsible for industrial-scale outbreaks. At least that's the idea -- the map has yet to be developed by the professors or anyone else. JILLIAN DUNHAM (MM75)"

2008-10-12T00:00:00Z,"-- two-thirds of them from Monsanto, BASF and Syngenta -- have been filed on the genes intended for use in crops designed to withstand environmental stresses. ''We're talking about a grab on strategic genes in the world's most important food crops,'' says Hope Shand, the research director for the watchdog organization ETC Group. ''This simply shouldn't be allowed.'' Jonathan Bryant, the director of North American business for BASF, which in 2007 signed a $1.5 billion deal to collaborate with Monsanto on the development of drought-tolerant crops, calls the patents ''a very small protection amongst a sea of opportunity.'' The continued consolidation of intellectual property combined with the sort of corporate cooperation currently being enjoyed by BASF and Monsanto is considered a recipe for disaster by some. The anti-genetic-modification activist Vandana Shiva, whose New Delhibased Navdanya group builds seed banks for the sharing of climate-resilient crops,says consolidation isn't just bad economics and bad social policy; it's bad science. ''As a physicist,'' she says, ''I can tell you that it is crazy in times of unpredictability to have centralized uniformity. If you are going to have climate chaos, what you need is lots of diversity, and you want that diversity in lots of places, in a very decentralized way.'' JOCELYN CRAUGH ZUCKERMAN"

In a man confronted daily with the task of separating the wanted from the unwanted, a degree of arrogance is indispensable.'' Confronted daily with the task of deciding who gets to eat at Shopsin's General Store, his 20-seat restaurant in New York's Essex Street Market, the cook and owner Kenny Shopsin separates the wanted from the unwanted with a degree of foulmouthed eloquence that makes Lenny Bruce look like Sirio Maccioni. This is food politics in its rawest form. ''We have a really wonderful relationship with our customers for the most part,'' he said. ''We kick [expletive] out. Regularly.'' Up to three times a day."

2008-10-12T00:00:00Z,"RECENTLY I MET Roger Barlow, the president of the Catfish Institute in Jackson, Miss., for a catfish lunch. Plates of blackened catfish Caesar salad, catfish in a crawfish étouffée and Southern-fried catfish lay between us, as did a P.R. folder embossed with the phrase ''U.S. Farm-raised Catfish: Safety You Can Trust.'' As the North American catfish's principal advocate, Barlow wanted to focus on the positive. He described how U.S. catfish adhered to the world's toughest quality standards; how, in their farm-raised form, catfish weren't scavengers, as in nature, but rather sweet-tasting surface-feeders, raised in well water and fattened on corn and soy. But by and by our discussion reached a point at which Barlow revealed some impending changes. Very soon U.S. farm-raised catfish, some of it anyway, would not be called catfish. 'The name we have chosen, and the name we have market-tested,'' he said, pausing slightly, ''is Delacata.'' Delacata, he explained, was going to be a specially filleted Grade-A piece of the best of the farmed North American channel catfish. It was being tested at high-end bistros in California, and the ''Iron Chef America'' judge Cat Cora had signed on to endorse it."

Intrigued, the New York chef Dan Barber traveled to Eduardo Sousa's farm, where the Sousa family has been making cruelty-free foie gras since 1812. Barber had what he called ''a great culinary experience.'' Here's what he saw: 1,000 geeseroaming through orchards and eating acorns, olives and figs. Sousa, who says he pampers his geese so much that wild flocks land on his farm and stay, takes advantage of the birds' natural tendencyto gorge in preparation for winter; he slaughters only in the fall or winter. When Barber got back from his trip, he was inspired to try the same thing. So some of the 70 geese that were already being raised at Barber's Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., were chosen for the experiment and are now fattening up for slaughter.

After two days of tense negotiations, Treasury officials urged a hesitant Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to proceed with its $9 billion investment in Morgan Stanley, which has sought the capital infusion to reassure investors and customers about its stability. The deal is considered a crucial step in the government's strategy for revitalizing the financial system by luring outside investment while it considers buying stock in banks directly. The transaction's failure would deal a blow to that effort and potentially unnerve the financial markets."

2008-10-13T00:00:00Z,"MAIORANA--Ronald. Anthony L. Watson, CEO and Chair, the Board of Directors and staff of EmblemHealth, the parent company of HIP Health Insurance Plan of New York and GHI, mourn the passing of Ronald Maiorana, a retired senior vice president of public affairs and a consultant to EmblemHealth at the time of his death. A former reporter for the New York Times and later press secretary and advisor to New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, he was 78 and died Thursday after a short illness at his home in East Quogue. Mr. Maiorana joined The Times as a copy boy in 1951 as a college freshman in night school and was promoted to reporter in 1955, covering a broad range of assignments in the New York metropolitan area and in Albany. He left The Times in 1968 to join Governor Rockefeller as an assistant press secretary. In 1969, the Governor appointed Mr. Maiorana as his press secretary and principal spokesperson. He accompanied the Governor on government and political trips across the nation and throughout South America. After Governor Rockefeller left office, Mr. Maiorana served as New York State Commissioner of Wagering Systems (1974-1975). He then joined the New York State Special Prosecutor for the Criminal Justice System as a director (1975-1976). He later worked with political consultants David Garth and Maureen Connelly on the U.S. Senate campaign of H. John Heinz of Pennsylvania and on all of Rudolph Giulianis campaigns for Mayor of New York City. He joined the administration of Mayor Giuliani as a senior advisor in 1994 and was appointed Commissioner of the New York City Community Assistance Unit in 1995. He left his city position to join HIP as a managing consultant for public affairs in 1996 and joined the health care company's executive staff full time in 1998. He retired April 30, 2007. At HIP, he was a trusted advisor to CEO Anthony L. Watson during a period of profound change in the firm, culminating with the affiliation with GHI to form EmblemHealth earlier this year. Mr. Maiorana also was a talented artist, an avocation he pursued for 60 years, opening his first exhibit AbstRactions in July. Two of his abstracts on canvas are in the Nelson Rockefeller collection. The EmblemHealth family extends its prayers and best wishes to Mr. Maiorana's family: his son Ronald Peter Maiorana and wife, Kelly Allman, and daughters Linda Catherine Williams and her husband Trevor Williams, and Janice Virginia Maiorana-Browne, and her husband Christopher Browne, and Mr. Maiorana's brother Victor and his wife, Rosalie. His wife, Phyllis, was killed accidentally when struck by a branch that fell from a tree on September 11, 2002. They had been married 47 years. In lieu of flowers, please make contributions to Little Flower Children and Family Services of Wading River, New York 11792. Friends may call Sunday from 2pm to 6pm at Fred H.

2008-10-13T00:00:00Z,"Once again this year, opponents of women's reproductive rights have managed to get initiatives aimed at ending or limiting abortion rights on ballots -- in South Dakota, Colorado and California. These measures, which violate women's privacy and threaten their health, have implications far beyond those states. If voters approve them, they will become a weapon in the right-wing campaign to overturn Roe v Wade. The South Dakota initiative is a near twin of the sweeping abortion ban handily rejected by South Dakota voters just two years ago. To make the ban seem less harsh, its backers have included language purporting to make exceptions for incest, rape or the life and health of the mother. But no one should be fooled. The exceptions were drafted to make it nearly impossible to get an abortion, even during the first trimester of pregnancy."

The faculty, staff, students, alumni, and Board of Overseers of Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health mourn the passing of their beloved friend, colleague, mentor, and Dean Emeritus, Dr. Allan Rosenfield. A worldrenowned leader in public health, he brought his considerable intellect, passion, courage, and persistence to addressing the public health concerns of vulnerable populations around the globe. His 22 year tenure as Dean marked a period of unprecedented growth and recognition for the School. He worked tirelessly to develop family planning and reproductive health service programs in the School's backyard of Northern Manhattan. His pioneering work on women's reproductive health and human rights, innovative family planning studies, strategies to address the tragedy of maternal deaths in poor countries, and the HIV/ AIDS pandemic had an impact on millions of lives globally. Because of his extraordinary efforts, faculty members at the School now serve the public's health in over 100 countries. He never shied away from asking the difficult questions; developing critical, and sometimes controversial, solutions to seemingly intractable problems; and relentlessly working to save the lives of women and children around the globe. He was never too busy to take a personal interest in the lives of those who worked with him or for him. He energized the field, inspired action, and left a legacy of leadership, knowledge, integrity, and kindness. He dedicated his life to improving the lives of others and motivated those fortunate enough to know him to do the same. Known as the ''Dean of Deans'' and a ''doctor to millions'', he will be greatly missed. The Mailman School community extends their deepest sympathy to his wife Clare, son Paul and his wife Rachel, daughter Jill and her husband Marc Baker, brother Jim, his five grandchildren, and the entire family.

Allan was a giant in the sexual and reproductive health field. His enduring commitment to helping women around the world obtain the family planning services and other reproductive health care they need to improve their lives was an inspiration to us all. We are grateful that Allan was a member of the Guttmacher Board for more than 20 years, and served as its chair from 1993 to 1995; he became an emeritus member in 2006. His intellect and vision helped make the Guttmacher Institute a stronger, more effective organization. We extend our deepest sympathy to Allan's family and share their loss of this remarkable man. ROSENFIELD--Allan G., M.D. The New York-Presbyterian Hospital community deeply mourns the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Dr. Allan Rosenfield. A brilliant man and a leader in the field of public health for more than 40 years, Dr. Rosenfield made lasting improvements to the health and human rights of people here in New York and around the world. As its dean, he made the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health one of the best there is. An obstetrician - gynecologist, he helped establish women's health as a subspecialty, and was among the first to draw attention to the women's health crisis in the developing world. He established the pioneering Averting Maternal Death and Disability program, supporting more than 85 projects in 50 countries. Locally, he expanded access to health clinics in the Washington Heights community. Passionate and personable, he inspired everyone he knew, bringing people together to accomplish even the most difficult challenges. A true humanitarian and tireless advocate for health of the most vulnerable populations, he will forever serve as a model of compassion and courage. Our heartfelt condolences to Dr. Rosenfield's wife, Clare, and the entire Rosenfield family. Herbert Pardes, M.D. President and CEO NY-Presbyterian Hospital ROSENFIELD--Allan. The New York Academy of Medicine acknowledges with profound sorrow the death of Allan Rosenfield, M.D., Fellow and Trustee of the Academy and the 2006 recipient of the Stephen Smith Award for Lifetime Achievement in Public Health. We join many in honoring his outstanding international accomplish ments and lifelong commitment to championing the rights and health of women, promoting interventions to improve maternal and child health, and fighting for health policies to protect the poor and disadvantaged. He was a transformational leader of the Columbia School of Public Health, tireless contributor to countless organizations and individuals, and deeply valued friend and colleague. We are especially grateful for his support of the Academy. The Academy Board, Fellows and staff extend deepest condolences to his family. Jo Ivey Boufford, M.D. President Thomas Q. Morris, M.D., Chairman, Board of Trustees ROSENFIELD--Dr. Allan. To say I knew this man, who touched so many millions of lives in such profound ways, is humbling. The world is diminished by his death, indeed as it has benefitted so much by his extraordinary life. My thoughts are with Clare and her family. Robert Mitchell ROSENFIELD--Allan. The board and staff of Public Health Solutions send our condolences to the Rosenfield family and Allan's many friends. While the world has lost a true humanitarian, his accomplishments will continue to benefit public health. Deborah M. Sale, Chairperson and Ellen Rautenberg, President and CEO ROSENFIELD--Allan.

ROSENFIELD--Allan, M.D. Columbia University Medical Center salutes the vision, commitment, energy, and legacy of Allan Rosenfield, our medical school graduate, faculty member, and dean emeritus of the Mailman School of Public Health. His dedication to public health and bringing health care to the underserved in our medical center backyard and around the world will be remembered through the programs he initiated, the faculty he recruited, the students he taught, and the awareness he raised of environmental health, maternal health, disaster preparedness, public health infrastructure, family planning, and HIV and AIDS in the developing world. Many organizations benefited from Dr. Rosenfield's 50year legacy in obstetrics, gynecology, and public health, but no organization benefited for as long as Columbia University did. Dr. Rosenfield served as dean of the Mailman School for 22 years, he was on the faculty of the medical school and public health school for 33 years, he contributed significantly to the evolution of public health from a small program in the medical school into a full-fledged school of public health, and he raised the stature of Columbia's public health education, research, and outreach to the top of national standings. His renowned leadership is a legacy we will devote ourselves to preserving for future generations of healthcare professionals and public health scholars. We send our condolences to Dr. Rosenfield's family and his large circle of friends and colleagues. Lee Goldman, M.D., Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences and Dean of the Faculties of Health Sciences and Medicine, Columbia University And the Columbia University Medical Center Community ROSENFIELD--Allan. We mourn the passing of our dear friend and mentor, Dr. Allan Rosenfield whose life was an example of service and courage. Allan's heroic dedication to improving global public health and stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS inspires us to work harder to find a cure. He will be missed but never forgotten.

2008-10-14T00:00:00Z,"Since 1929, Republicans and Democrats have each controlled the presidency for nearly 40 years. So which party has been better for American pocketbooks and capitalism as a whole? Well, here's an experiment: imagine that during these years you had to invest exclusively under either Democratic or Republican administrations. How would you have fared? As of Friday, a $10,000 investment in the S.& P. stock market index* would have grown to $11,733 if invested under Republican presidents only, although that would be $51,211 if we exclude Herbert Hoover's presidency during the Great Depression. Invested under Democratic presidents only, $10,000 would have grown to $300,671 at a compound rate of 8.9 percent over nearly 40 years."
