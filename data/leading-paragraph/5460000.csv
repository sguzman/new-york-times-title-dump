To put it another way, the art is as easy on the intellect as it is on the eye and mainly this is because the eight sculptors involved use materials that call for neither a vast studio space nor an arsenal of tools."

When preferred plants disappear, butterflies are at risk. Adult butterflies sip nectar from many flowers - primarily yellow, orange, pink and purple ones - but the females require specific plants as host plants for their eggs and food for the caterpillars."

They are able to re-create 19th-century Africa, the battles of the Civil War, volcanic eruptions and the new Dark Ages that will follow World War III. In movies, fetuses can talk and horses fly. Movies make the impossible look ordinary."
1990-03-18T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: PRAGUE this spring has a supplementary reason for feeling like a city woken from a bad dream to a world full of promise and delight. Its wine cellars are stocked with the 1989 vintage, one of those that almost sing with perfume.

Playboys don't bother with any of zydeco's latest borrowings: no funk, no rock, no country-and-western, just the homegrown heritage of Cajun two-steps and waltzes tinctured with blues and rhythm-and-blues. Wednesday night at Tramps, in the band's New York City debut, the closest thing he sang to a pop song was the Johnny Horton hit ''The Battle of New Orleans,'' from 1959."

It has the boulevards and the opera, the cafes and the trams, the public gardens and private villas. And now, as another era and another century come to a close, it is showing signs of the same freneticism and languor, the same eagerness to do business and seek pleasure that characterized its golden age in 1900."

1990-03-18T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: A DESERT SCENE IN WHICH MILlions of dollars change hands under a tent seems better suited to an oil-rich sheikdom than an Arizona polo field called Horseworld.

1990-03-18T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: There is no question about the devotion to the dance of Doris Humphrey that drives the American Dance Repertory Theater, which performed on Thursday at the Pace Downtown Theater.

1990-04-06T00:00:00Z,"Not content to watch old Presley movies on television, John Waters has made a brand new one, and made it in the manner of a teen-crazed Cecil B. DeMille. ''Cry-Baby,'' Mr. Waters's epic vision of mid-1950's high-school Americana, has a sweeping scale not usually associated with so dopey a subject, and for a while, almost enough exuberance to make that scale seem right. It also has droll costumes, elaborate musical numbers and a cast that's less a dramatic ensemble than a collection of found art. What it doesn't have, unfortunately, is enough true conviction to rise above novelty status. Nor does it really have a plot. Mr. Waters shares with others like David Lynch a profoundly ironic view of picket-fence, middle-American platitudes. But in his case, that manifests itself as a deep and enduring affection for the grotesque, an affection that renders the forced innocence of ''Cry-Baby'' very precarious indeed. Unlike his sunnier and more spontaneous ''Hairspray,'' ''Cry-Baby'' has its brittle side, especially after the fun of initially encountering its ringer-filled cast (e.g. Patricia Hearst as a crossing guard) has worn thin. The latter part of the film is devoted almost entirely to empty posturing."

The tin loudspeakers in subway stations, for example, that make the train announcements sound like somebody sawing a piece of sheet metal.

To be sure, at some time in their youth they would have had to play the game, if only because it cannot be learned any other way.

In addition to the warning about crime on the beaches, riders of the funicular to the top of Corcovado Mountain should be careful of cameras, jewelry and handbags while seated near the open windows. The view is spectacular, but street urchins loiter inconspicuously along the tracks and platforms, make a quick grab for valuables and disappear into the slums where they live."

1990-04-15T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: LOUISIANA, which used to have 12, now has only one. Oregon is threatening to drop any that bring in less than $50,000, which has the state arts council worried after falling $2,000 short last year.

Even though the complaint may later be dropped (at the victim's discretion), it will at minimum put these people on notice that more is at risk than a 20-minute stay in the penalty box."

It is a dubious proposition; the bombs were disbursed before the German arrests of the Frankfurt terrorists, and it is unlikely that detaining those individuals two months before Lockerbie would have irreparably incapacitated Jabril's large, well organized group."

It is hard to fathom how a composer could have written so convincingly sunny and lyrical a symphony in Vienna on the brink of World War I.

1990-04-15T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Shame on you, Paul Levine! Why blame aging for problems that are individually yours? It's unfortunate that you suffer as you do, and I sympathize with your ''creaks'' and pain and asthma, but it's a bit much at 48 to chalk it all up to old age. Even 5-year-olds can become asthmatic, so don't attribute that to old age either."
