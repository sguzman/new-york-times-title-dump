2010-08-24T00:00:00Z,"WASSERMAN--Craig lost his valiant fight against a malignant brain tumor Monday. Craig fought stoically for two and a half years and never stopped living his life despite the challenges caused by his disease. His unbelievable determination, unwavering strength and love for his family will live on forever. Craig is survived by his wife, Marla, and his two adoring children, Alison and Jared. While nothing will ever fill the void left by his passing, Alison and Jared were blessed to have Craig as a father and he gave more to his children in the short number of years he had than most give in a lifetime. Craig is also survived by his mother, Sandra, and his sisters Debra and Mindee and his in-laws, Rita and Stan Weinstein and Marcy Schneider and Marni Charm. He is the son of the late Bert W. Wasserman. Craig spent more than 23 years practicing law at his second home, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, and he remained a proud partner until the day he died. His business and legal acumen were legendary and his clients clamored for his invaluable judgment. Craig graduated from Yale University and Yale Law School and was a founding member of the Slifka Center at Yale. Craig's many acts of generosity and friendship will never be forgotten and the world is a sadder place as a result of his death. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions be made to support brain tumor research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center where a website has been established, http:/skcc.convio.net/CraigWasserman, or checks can be mailed. Funeral services will be held at 11:45am, Wednesday, August 25th at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street."

2010-08-24T00:00:00Z,"Sunday, Aug. 8 When doing fieldwork in Congo one thing is for sure: the best-laid plans will very probably go horribly awry. This time it's nothing too dire, but our ''10-hour trip'' upriver to the small settlement of Tshumbiri has taken a full three days. It's been a series of very long days sprawled on top of bags full of our hard, lumpy equipment, slowly motoring upriver. The river is huge here, more than a kilometer wide, and as we struggle upstream we dodge large clumps of grass, some as large as small islands, that flow downstream in the current. The fast boat we hitched a ride on immediately morphed into a slow boat, probably because it was filled to capacity with our field gear, the fishing team and three other passengers who are also trying to reach the Malebo field station, not to survey fishes but to see bonobos."

Nearly five years after Katrina and the devastating failures of the levee system, New Orleans is well on its way to getting the protection system Congress ordered: a ring of 350 miles of linked levees, flood walls, gates and pumps that surrounds the city and should defend it against the kind of flooding that in any given year has a 1 percent chance of occurring."

2010-08-24T00:00:00Z,"HUBBARD--G. Morrison, Jr.,died peacefully, August 21, 2010 at his home in Summit, NJ. He was 101. Born in 1909, he resided in Summit, NJ all of his life. He was the oldest camper from one of the oldest camps in the country. Keewadyn, Salisbury, Vermont. Before he was fifteen, he had built up a writing paper business in eight surrounding towns and had about 200 customers. At 17, he had crossed the country with three other boys in a second hand Buick, returning home by working on a cargo freighter the day before school started. It stopped at three Mexican ports and went through the Panama Canal. He also spent summers sailing with several boys from Long Island to Canada on chartered sail boats. He attended the public schools in Summit, and was in the Class of 1926. He graduated from Lawrenceville in 1928 and Dartmouth College in 1932. Afterwards, he joined his father's firm of Hubbard, Westervelt, and Motley in New York City. He married Elizabeth Jones, his childhood sweetheart, in 1942 and proceeded to his Army training assignment on the same day. After World War II ended, he retired from the military in 1945 as a major. His father having died during the war, he and his brother, John C. Hubbard, built the firm into one of the best in the country that arranged financing for corporations. They sold their company in 1968 to Merrill Lynch becoming a wholly owned subsidiary and the brothers were partners in Merrill Lynch. Shortly thereafter, his brother retired and he continued solely running the company. He served on Merrill Lynch's domestic and international boards and various committees. In 1974, his company changed its name to Merrill Lynch Hubbard. He retired that year from Merrill Lynch, having reached 65, the mandatory retirement age at that time. At the time of his death, in addition to being a retired partner of Merrill Lynch, he was an emeritus director of Urstadt Biddle, formerly Hubbard Real Estate, a REIT founded by the two brothers in 1968 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. He was also an emeritus director of the Hyde and Watson Foundation. He was honored for his service in World War II in May 2002 by the State of New Jersey and the City of Summit with citations and a key to the city. In 1999, he was honored by the Board of Education for his civic contributions by renaming Lincoln Hubbard School. In June 2006, at 97 years old he received a proclamation and second key to the city with appreciation from Summit, recognizing his lifelong civic commitment. Also, Summit's local television channel, TV36, premiered the series, ""Legends of Summit,"" with an hour-long interview in two parts on him. He was a member of the Central Presbyterian Church since 1927, giving him the longest membership in the church. He was an honorary member of the Canoe Brook Country Club, the Beacon Hill Club, and the Union League Club in New York City. He was also a member emeritus of the Baltusrol Golf Club. He played many of the leading golf courses in Europe and the United States, including the Augusta National many times. He was a member of the United States Seniors' Golf Association. He traveled for business and pleasure in most of the 50 states and to 40 foreign countries. His wife Elizabeth Jones Hubbard, predeceased him in 2005 after 63 years of marriage. He is survived by his daughter, Morrene Jacobs of Short Hills, NJ, a son, G.M. Hubbard, III (Mary) of Savannah, GA., four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Known for his character, generosity, wisdom, and sense of humor, Mr. Hubbard told wonderful stories of his life experiences. When asked about the major challenges facing us today, he always replied, ""Keeping civic pride and responsibility in our home, our schools and the community. Civic pride and patriotism are not bad attributes to live by."" His greatest concern for our country is the loss of individual incentive. Calling hours will be Wednesday, August 25, 5-7pm at the William R. Dangler Funeral Home, 309 Springfield Ave., Summit, NJ (908-273-2323). Memorial Services will be Thursday, August 26, 11:00am at Central Presbyterian Church, Summit, NJ.

2010-08-25T19:34:00Z,"To some extent, the controversy surrounding the Cordoba Initiative's Lower Manhattan venture is really a controversy about how non-Muslim Westerners should relate to the would-be spokesmen for a moderate (or ""moderate,"" depending on your point of view) Islam. One school of thought, prominent among conservatives but associated with liberal thinkers like Paul Berman as well, holds that anything short of an absolute commitment to Enlightenment values is unacceptable from such figures, and that moderate Muslims must demonstrate this commitment, and prove their secular bona fides, by making a frontal assault on Islamic culture as it currently exists. To this school, explicitly-liberal figures like Ayaan Hirsi Ali or Irshad Manji represent the beau ideal of moderate Islam, because they're forthright in their critiques of Muslim societies' failings, and unstinting in their insistence that the Western way of faith and politics is ultimately superior. A high-profile bridge-builder like the ubiquitous Tariq Ramadan, on the other hand,  is much more suspect, and possibly beyond the pale - because he tends to use different language and strike different notes depending on his audience, because he often seems to be making excuses for illiberalism in the Islamic world, because he's less-than-forthright in his condemnations of certain kinds of extremism, and so on down the line. To his critics, such bobbing and weaving is proof enough that his ""moderate Islam"" project is really just a flowery fraud and a Trojan Horse for Wahhabism, with no redeeming value whatsoever. And this critique is easily extended to many other self-described moderates as well - including, lately, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, who arguably has a stronger claim to moderation than Ramadan, but who seems to share some of his more evasive qualities when the conversation turns to, say, Hamas or the Islamic Republic of Iran."

2010-08-25T00:00:00Z,"A tree's shadow, a darkened doorway, what looks to be a section of ripped-up carpet. This was the scene on Nicholas Avenue on Staten Island after one of the most grisly crimes of the summer, a murder-suicide and arson fire that left a mother and her four children dead. Three of the children's throats had been cut, and investigators initially focused on one of them, a 14-year-old boy, as the killer after the fire on July 22. But autopsies of the victims later found that the mother, Leisa Jones, 30, had died of smoke inhalation, indicating that she had been alive when the fire was set and contradicting the theory that the 14-year-old had carried out the killings. A charred note also implicated Ms. Jones. ''We just pray for their souls,'' a cousin said. Earlier photographs in the series are at nytimes.com/lens."

Thompson), aided by William Tanner and possibly a third person, rushed Mr. King's brother Henry Glover, who was bleeding from a gunshot wound to the chest, to a temporary SWAT compound in the Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans. (A police officer was later charged with the shooting.) Mr. King hoped to get medical attention from the police. Instead the brothers were handcuffed, and Henry would soon die. His charred body was eventually discovered inside a burned car on a levee on the banks of the Mississippi, not far from a police station -- an incident that resulted in the indictment of five police officers by a federal grand jury in June. The case, which involves charges that also include obstruction of justice and lying to the F.B.I., is one of at least eight current federal investigations into the New Orleans Police Department. In this collaboration with the nonprofit investigative news service ProPublica and The Times-Picayune, ''Frontline'' investigates several other mysterious deaths in the storm's aftermath -- including a shooting on Danziger Bridge in New Orleans in which officers shot six unarmed civilians, killing two -- and the climate in the city that led to them.

2010-08-27T11:59:26Z,"Frank Gehry designed the first of his famous fish lamps in 1983, when he was asked by the Formica Corporation for ways to use the company’s new laminate product, ColorCore, which was colored all the way through, rather than just on the surface. When Gehry was playing around with the material, he broke a piece, which looked to him like a fish scale — and the rest is design history, with the fish swimming into the collections of art world notables like Jasper Johns. On Sunday, “Fish Forms: Lamps by Frank Gehry” opens at the Jewish Museum. Organized by Ruth Beesch, the museum’s deputy director for program, the exhibition, which includes just eight lamps, was inspired by the glass fish lamp in the museum’s own collection. The lamps themselves are engaging objects, the gentle glow of the light within them contrasting with their substantial, expressionist bases. But they were never designed just for the sake of making something. The fish form was something that had fascinated Gehry for its purity and its dynamism and was well on its way to becoming a major theme in his architecture, a point that is made quite well in a video that accompanies the exhibition, which runs through Oct. 31."

Strictly couture (bien sur!), the duo took two weeks to make. “I had to special-order Anna’s wig and cut it myself to get the bob right,” Mr. Yang says. “And Grace’s hair was the right color, but it needed a perm.” Alas, the question on everyone’s lips – What are they wearing? – has a disappointingly democratic answer. “The outfits are my own take on their signature looks,” he says. “It would have been unfair to single out specific designers.” Anna and Grace will be auctioned off on charitybuzz.com beginning August 31, with the proceeds benefiting The New York City Aids Fund."

Typically in Russia, such efforts lead to little but holding cells or worse for proponents of a cause. But supporters of the Khimki Forest were handed a surprising victory on Thursday when President Dmitri A. Medvedev reacted to the public outcry. He postponed construction of the highway.

From 1983 to 1989, a time of significant growth for the Museum and of the accompanying financial challenges, he chaired the Finance Committee with sound judgment and far-sighted guidance. With his wife, Katusha, he supported the Met's capital projects, publications, and the departments of Egyptian Art and Musical Instruments. Addressing the Board in 1989, he said that his work at the Museum brought him great happiness. Through decades of sharing his wisdom, experience, energetic spirit, and good cheer, he in turn influenced this institution in myriad ways that will continue to benefit the staff and millions of visitors annually, long into the future.

2010-08-27T00:00:00Z,"At the end of August, the narratives around baseball's top awards have formed, and the contenders are jockeying for position for the stretch run. The 60 writers who vote for these awards have their reasons for how they vote, but as a body they often favor runs batted in leaders on playoff teams for the Most Valuable Player awards. Sabermetricians back to the 1980s and before have been working on ''one-number'' measures: a statistic that takes every contribution from players of different skills and positions and runs it through a variety of formulas ending with one number. This number typically known as wins above replacement or WAR endeavors to tell us how many wins a player was worth to his term over replacement talent. The idea of a replacement player is a debated one, but the basic premise is that if a team lost a player, it would use a bench player or a call-up from Class AAA to replace him. This mythical replacement player is our baseline for all evaluation."

(Discovery) BEYOND SURVIVAL WITH LES STROUD In ''Survivorman'' Mr. Stroud stranded himself -- equipped only with his clothes, a multitool, a pocketful of everyday items and a video camera -- in some of the remotest locations on the planet and then tried to get out alive. In this new series he immerses himself in daily life with indigenous people to learn survival techniques and rituals rarely divulged to outsiders. His first stop: Sri Lanka, above, where he studies post-tsunami behavior alongside the men of the Veddah tribe, once believed to be half human and half demon, and takes part in two ''devil dances,'' believed to exorcise dark forces. Leading in at 9 is a new episode of ''Man, Woman, Wild,'' in which Mykel Hawke, a wilderness expert and former Green Beret, and his wife, Ruth England, a city girl and television journalist, find themselves all wet in Utah when their raft overturns in the chilly Colorado River. 6 A.M. (TCM) SUMMER UNDER THE STARS: OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND ''Every actor in the business owes a great debt of gratitude to Olivia for what she did,'' Bette Davis said after Ms. de Havilland, now 94, took Warner Brothers to court in 1943 -- and won -- for trying to keep her under contract after she believed she had fulfilled her legal obligation. This all-day tribute runs the gamut from ''The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex'' (1939), at 10, in which Ms. de Havilland plays Lady Penelope Gray to Davis's Queen Elizabeth and Errol Flynn's Earl of Essex, to ''The Heiress'' (1949), at 8 p.m., in which Ms. de Havilland subverted her beauty (and won the first of two best-actress Oscars). She portrays the title character, the awkward young woman at the heart of Henry James's novel ''Washington Square,'' in 1840s New York City. She falls for a handsome suitor (Montgomery Clift), whom her father (Ralph Richardson) suspects is a fortune hunter."

2010-08-29T00:00:00Z,"Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer performed their compelling act a few times at Wimbledon, several more times in Paris, but also in Madrid, Shanghai, Dubai, Hamburg and Monaco. The rivalry between Nadal and Federer, considered the two best tennis players in the world, has been showcased all over the globe, but never in New York. They have played 21 times since 2004, when they first met in Miami, - the only time they played in anything other than the final or semifinals of a tournament - and Nadal holds a 14-7 advantage. But somehow they have never met at the United States Open, where Federer has reached the last six finals and won five and where Nadal has never make it past the semifinals. The rivalry may seem one-sided, especially on clay, but on center court at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Federer had been invincible until last year's final, when he lost to Juan Martin del Potro. If Federer, who had won 41 consecutive matches at Arthur Ashe, can get back to the final, and Nadal overcomes his usual end-of-summer obstacles and reaches the Open final, it would provide the most compelling final matchup here since Pete Sampras beat Andre Agassi in 2002. The friendly foes, Nadal and Federer, No. 1 against No. 2. ''People seem to love it,'' Federer said. ''It's one of the biggest rivalries we have in all of sports, and I'm happy it's been on a fair basis. It would be a bit of a pain if it weren't like that.'' Mostly because of the respect Nadal showed for Federer when he eventually assumed his mantle as the world's best player, Nadal never outwardly annoyed Federer, so their relationship has not had the edge that Jimmy Connors's and John McEnroe's or Justine Henin's and Serena Williams's had. ''Look, he's not my rival since three weeks,'' Federer said. ''He's been my rival for almost five years now. So we're a very healthy rivalry. We get along really well. We chat a lot in the locker rooms, just hang out sometimes. ''So it's nice to have a rival like Rafa who has been so respectful, really. I think I've helped him to be a better player. Same for me. I think he's helped me to become a better player.'' Whether the speed of center court or Nadal's late-season injuries kick in again to thwart the matchup, Nadal said he fully expected Federer to hold up his end. ''If I am in the last rounds, I am going to have a big chance to play against him,'' Nadal said, ''Because he always is here.'' Federer comes into the Open on an upswing after a difficult summer. After winning the Australian Open in January for his record 16th Grand Slam title, he did not win another tournament until Cincinnati last week. At the French Open, he lost to Robin Soderling in the quarterfinals, breaking his record of 23 consecutive Grand Slam semifinal appearances. After he lost to Tomas Berdych in the semifinals at Wimbledon, he uncharacteristically complained of leg and back problems. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

My plan for my 10th week of travel through Latin America had just enough in common with Nicholas Garrigan's to give me pause. I was in Mexico, a country in the throes of a murderous drug war, where I had decided to buy a Oaxaca state map, arbitrarily pick a town maybe an hour from the capital (also named Oaxaca) and settle in for the week.

To celebrate Fashion's Night Out on Sept. 10, Barneys New York commissioned the Brooklyn-based artist Andrew Yang to make these one-of-kind, hand-sewn, hand-painted rag-doll replicas of the celebrated Vogue editors. Strictly couture (bien sur!), the duo took two weeks to make. ''I had to special-order Anna's wig and cut it myself to get the bob right,'' Mr. Yang says. ''And Grace's hair was the right color, but it needed a perm.'' Alas, the question on everyone's lips - What are they wearing? - has a disappointingly democratic answer. ''The outfits are my own take on their signature looks,'' he says. ''It would have been unfair to single out specific designers.''

We spent three days in Havasu over the Fourth of July, camping and hiking with a small group of fellow adventurers and three wonderful guides. One of my favorite parts about our hikes was the water crossings. We wore mesh shoes and plodded through knee-deep water that cooled us from the bottom up, a welcome relief from the canyon's 105-degree heat. The water was the most amazing shade of turquoise blue. I love the contrast of the blue-green to the red rock walls of the canyon. Georgia Hunter Farinholt, Seattle"

Among other things, the collection's test-pattern logo is reproduced on hang tags and a T-shirt; a motherboard pattern adorns tights and a miniskirt; and tables (the Electric table, shown here, is $1,000) have legs inspired by Canada's ubiquitous electrical transmission towers. The Paris retail mecca Colette has picked up the limited-supply collection, which goes on sale there Sept. 7. It's also available at selected Roots stores in Canada, or at usa.roots.com.

Although Houston is the best team in the West division, do not be shocked if Tulsa or Southern Methodist threatens to win nine games in the regular season. S.M.U., against all odds, won eight games in 2009. June Jones must know what he's doing. The bottom of the West is extremely weak. Rice and Tulane may not combine for five victories. Texas-El Paso must get back to a bowl game to ease the pressure on Coach Mike Price. The East division is more competitive. East Carolina is the defending division champion, but the Pirates will be hard-pressed to repeat. Ruffin McNeill takes over for Skip Holtz as coach. Central Florida looks to be the team to beat, if it can find any offense. Southern Mississippi, on the other hand, has the offense but can't stop anyone. Coach Doc Holliday replaces Mark Snyder at Marshall. The Thundering Herd could find itself bowl eligible, but U.C.F. is more consistent.

2010-08-30T00:00:00Z,"Asking you to say something if you happen to see something is a modest request. But what might induce you to adopt a disguise and spy on your fellow citizens? How about a generous proliferation of vice, combined with a healthy dose of corrupt law enforcement, and some strong encouragement (including a small stipend) from morally minded civic leaders? Out of just such fertile soil, a wide-ranging program of amateur surveillance flourished in early 20th century New York City. Ordinary folks - settlement house workers, off-duty state Excise Department employees, dry-goods jobbers - moonlighted as denizens of the demimonde, going undercover to document a profusion of turpitude in the bustling city."

2010-08-30T00:00:00Z,"LOS ANGELES - It looks as though Time Warner Cable customers won't lose ESPN after all.The Walt Disney Company and Time Warner Cable, which have been engaged in heated negotiations over a new distribution contract for Disney-owned television channels, were close enough to a deal on Sunday to remove attack ads aimed at each other.Even so, a final resolution remains days away, emphasized people briefed on the discussions who asked for anonymity because the talks are private. Time Warner Cable's contract with Disney expires Thursday.''The Walt Disney Company and Time Warner Cable have made significant progress in our negotiations for continued distribution of ABC, Disney and ESPN networks and services,'' a joint statement released late Saturday read. ''We are now focusing all our attention on a successful conclusion of these efforts.'' Pressure has been mounting on both companies for months, with each aggressively asking viewers to pick a side - theirs - in television, newspaper and Web ads. Disney is seeking to pry undisclosed fee increases out of a reluctant Time Warner Cable.In a full-page ad that ran in The New York Times on Sunday, for instance, Time Warner Cable warned, ''While we've been working hard to reach an agreement, Disney has been threatening a blackout - and telling Time Warner Cable customers to switch TV service providers.'' (The detente came too late for Time Warner Cable to withdraw the ad.) Disney had been warning viewers that they could lose access to Oprah Winfrey's farewell season and college football games.Indications emerged last week that tensions between the companies were easing. On a Time Warner Cable blog last Wednesday, a spokesman, Jeff Simmermon, wrote of the Disney negotiators, ''I run into those guys in the hallway, in the bathroom, at the coffee machine - and they don't look like they're having any more fun than our people.''A smaller fee fight is also under way at AT&T, which is negotiating a new contract with Crown Media Holdings, parent company of the Hallmark Channel. Last week, the companies warned that Hallmark would be dropped at the end of the month from AT&T's U-verse service, which has about 2.3 million subscribers.Hallmark's president, Bill Abbott, said Thursday that AT&T was ''insisting on unreasonable rates that would seriously jeopardize our longevity.'' AT&T said it was ''making every effort to reach a fair agreement.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

For the first time in Agassi's 20 years at the Open, he faced a fifth-set tie breaker. Blake grabbed a 3-0 lead and had two serves coming with a 5-4 lead.

Wife of 60 years to the late Seymour ""Cy"" Leslie, and daughter of the late Florence and George Miller, Bobby is survived by her sister Sally (Larry), loving daughters Ellen, Janie and Carol, her admiring grandchildren Julie (Dan), David (Ariana), Sara (Jeff) and Ben, and her adoring great-grandchildren Jack and William. Bobby was a dedicated philanthropist and devoted advocate for world peace and equality, whose work on behalf of international women's rights were the focus of her extensive volunteer career. After serving as the president of a local National Council of Jewish Women's chapter, Bobby became a Non-Governmental Observer at the United Nations, where she most notably served as a delegate to the 1980 Mid-Decade Conference for Women in Copenhagen and the 1985 End-Decade Conference in Nairobi, and later represented the ICJW at the NGO Forum on Women at the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. Bobby traveled extensively in the U.S. and abroad, speaking to groups about the urgent need to improve the status of women worldwide. Born in Manhattan and raised in Woodmere, NY, where she and Cy also raised their family and lived for the rest of her life, Bobby was the quintessential matriarch and the ultimate example of class. Aside from creating a home filled with strong family values and irresistible kitchen aromas, Bobby became a passionate sportswoman, playing golf, tennis and lifting weights well into her 80s, and she will always be remembered for her unique ability to charm a crowd with her piano, or defeat the Times' weekend crossword puzzles with ease. Bobby received her B.S. in Business Administration from Syracuse University, and later pursued a post-graduate degree in Sociology at Adelphi University. One of Bobby's most prized accomplishments, though, came much later in life when she finally achieved her Bat Mitzvah, a true tribute of her dedication to and appreciation for her religious heritage. Along with her loving husband Cy, Bobby was dedicated to local causes and was a firm supporter of world peace and human equality. Together, they were active in B'nai B'rith and the Anti-Defamation League and were founding members of the JCC of the Greater Five Towns. Bobby will be remembered as a woman of integrity, loyalty and passion, and as a woman who gave back and lived life to its fullest.

Even as the Pakistani team faced humiliating defeat by England in a game played on the hallowed grasses of Lord's ground in London, traditionally regarded as the home of cricket, Scotland Yard detectives interrogated three of the team's key players -- including the captain and an 18-year-old novice who has been the team's star performer in its series with England -- in their hotel on Saturday night."

The biennale committee’s decision to ask the Japanese architect (and this year’s Pritzker Prize winner) Kazuyo Sejima of SANAA to be the director of its 12th installment certainly was an interesting one. Sejima herself is the first to point out in interviews that the combination of a woman director (a first) and an Asian director (also a first) must have felt particularly right for a time when people are looking for alternatives to the gold-rush mentality and its male protagonists, who dominated architecture throughout most of the Noughties. Even the mention of people in the title of the exhibition, “People Meet in Architecture,” is a first in the history of the architecture biennale. Of the exhibition, Sejima said in her own few words that it will have “multiple viewpoints rather than a single orientation.

2010-08-31T11:00:31Z,"When Charles Lindbergh took off from Long Island’s Roosevelt Field on May 20, 1927, en route to Paris aboard the Spirit of St. Louis, his wardrobe was a study in packing light: Army-issue breeches and ankle boots, an Abercrombie and Fitch flight jacket designed by Benjamin Willis (later of Willis and Geiger Outfitters fame), a brown A. G. Spalding & Brothers jumpsuit to keep out the cold, a wool-lined leather helmet, goggles, a white shirt and — in a nod to his home base and to the monoplane that would, 3,610 miles and some 33 hours later, make him the most famous man in the world — a blue-and-red striped tie from Vandervoort’s department store in St. Louis. The accessories were minimal, too: a pair of quart canteens, cotton wadding in his ears and a St. Christopher medal, handed to him at takeoff by a well-wisher named Katie Butler. The day after Lindbergh landed at Le Bourget airfield, he stepped out onto a balcony of the American Embassy and greeted a throng of euphoric Parisians in a hastily borrowed double-breasted suit. He’d flown with little more than the flying togs that, captured in untold miles of newsreel footage, became the indelible sartorial image associated with Lindbergh, a man Will Rogers described as a ‘‘slim, tall, bashful, smiling American boy.’’"

On Oct. 21, the Whitney and the Carnegie Museum of Art will present ''Paul Thek: Diver, A Retrospective'' the first major United States survey of works by this legendary and complex artist, who died of complications from AIDS in 1988 at the age of 54, after a creative life spent shuttling nomadically among points as diverse as Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, the East Village and a remote corner of Fire Island. Included in the lineup are the ''meat pieces'' he began exhibiting in 1964 - uncannily realistic wax depictions of hunks of flesh, dotted with flies and encased in Plexiglas, which were his ''hot'' answer to the art world's prevalent trend of ''cool'' Minimalism, and which anticipated the works of Robert Gober and Damien Hirst by decades.

2010-08-31T00:00:00Z,"For kids around the country it's back-to-school time. But for many of them, it's also the return of headache season. Doctors say frequent headaches and migraines are among the most common childhood health complaints, yet the problem gets surprisingly little attention from the medical community. Many pediatricians and parents view migraines as an adult condition. And because many children complain of headaches more often during the school year than the summer, parents often think a child is exaggerating symptoms to get out of schoolwork."
2010-08-31T00:00:00Z,"Voters in states like Illinois and North Carolina, where both the Republican and Democratic nominees for Senate are unpopular and where the number of undecided voters remains high, might lament the choice before them. Sure, if they wanted to register their displeasure with the major-party nominees, they could vote for a minor-party candidate instead (LeAlan Jones, the Green Party's nominee in Illinois, has polled as high as 14 percent in some surveys). Or they could simply stay home. But other voters, especially those who might consider it their patriotic duty to vote, might wish for a more affirmative way to register their displeasure with their choices. In Nevada, they have that option - the ability to cast a literal protest vote."

2010-09-01T12:36:22Z,"Forget waxed mustaches, plaid thermoses and suspenders. The new men’s-wear label Jon Ashe is bringing back a sleeker and more understated version of heritage chic. “You have to strike a balance between being innovative and tribal,” says Jonas Hegewisch, who designs the fledgling collection. His idea of “tribal” doesn’t include far-flung ethnic influences. He’s talking about belonging to a social “tribe,” as in Williamsburg hipsters or corporate America. “The aesthetic that appeals to me has a certain rustic quality,” explains Hegewisch, who is originally from Germany. (Before starting Jon Ashe, he collaborated with his wife Ursula on Wearkstatt, a fashion-forward bridal business; he also owned Trailer Park, one of Berlin’s coolest biergartens.) “But I try to bring different elements together.”"
2010-09-01T11:00:14Z,"To create their new collection of hyper-masculine curiosities, the glass-blowing studio Esque and the art and design firm No. 1 Son (both based in Portland, Ore.) pilfered ideas from millennia past. Aptly named (Bar)barian, the collaboration was inspired by what Andi Kovel and Justin Parker of Esque call the ‘‘noble savage’’: objects that were once made from horn, wood and stone are reimagined in glass and leather. Why serve drinks from an ordinary decanter when you could present (Bar)barian’s Flagon, a swirling glass vessel that resembles the horn of some mythical beast? Or why not go all out with the Travel Bar: two hornlike glasses, a bone-shaped stirrer and a leather studded case in which to lug them? Just don’t go hunting for dinner with the OB-J slingshot. Rendered in wood-colored glass with an inelastic leather strap and fragile handle, it’s entirely nonfunctional. But that’s entirely the point: by allowing utility and convenience to go the way of the woolly mammoth, (Bar)barian has transformed objects from the past into up-to-the-minute pieces of pure decadence."

2010-09-01T00:01:16Z,"Should you stretch before a run? That question, which has prompted countless academic studies, debates and inter-running-partner squabbles, is now at the heart of a notable new study published in August on the Web site of USA Track and Field, the sport’s national governing body. The study, one of the largest of its kind, involved almost 1,400 runners, from age 13 to past 60, who were assigned randomly to two groups. The first group did not stretch before their runs, while otherwise maintaining their normal workout routine: the same mileage, warm-up (minus any stretching) and so on. The second group stretched, having received photographs and specific instructions for a series of simple, traditional poses, like leaning over and touching toes, that focused on the calf, hamstring and quadriceps muscles. The volunteers were told to hold each stretch for 20 seconds, a technique known as static stretching. The entire routine required three to five minutes and was to be completed immediately before a run."

That has been the question posed to virtually every prominent player who attended a news conference Saturday regarding his now famous William Tell video in which he twice hits a metal bottle off someone's head with a serve. While most players claimed they hadn't seen the video, Andy Murray was unequivocal about it's authenticity. ''You think that was real?'' he retorted with a smile. ''Is that right? No, I like the advert, it was good fun. There's not a chance it's real, though.'' Andy Roddick, who has one of the fastest serves on tour, said he hadn't seen it, but doubted even he could duplicate such a feat. ''Two in a row? I wouldn't like my chances,'' he said. ''I wouldn't like the chances of someone standing there with their head in the way of it, either.'' Rafael Nadal and Venus Williams also said they hadn't seen the video. But Kim Clijsters did, and when asked if she believed it was authentic, she said, ''Let me just say that I would not hold that thing on my head even if it was Roger Federer. There's your answer.''

Neighbors gathered around a police communications truck, but officers kept the crowd back. Some onlookers were upset; others, intrigued. ''How could this happen?'' they asked.

Born January 28, 1914 in Galesburg, Illinois to Roy C. Ingersoll and Lulu Hinchliff Ingersoll, he was educated at Phillips Academy, Andover and Yale University. In 1938, he married Coralyn Eleanor Reid Ingersoll (Ellie), best friend and loving wife for 63 years, and together they were life-long residents of the Chicago area. Robert was CEO and Chairman of Borg-Warner Corporation, and a director of numerous corporate boards, including First National Bank of Chicago, Atlantic Richfield Company, Burlington Northern, Caterpillar Inc., Kraft Inc., Marcor Corporation, Royal Group, Inc., and Weyerhaeuser Company. He served The United States of America as Ambassador to Japan and Deputy Secretary of State under the Nixon and Ford Administrations, and was awarded The First Class Order of the Rising Sun, the highest honor awarded to a foreigner, from the Government of Japan. His strong commitment to and belief in education was reflected in his work as Director and Chairman of the Panasonic Foundation, as a life trustee of the University of Chicago, and as trustee of Smith College, California Institute of Technology and the Aspen Institute. Out of his love of nature and the American West, he served as Vice Chairman of the National Parks Foundation and spent most of his vacation time and retirement in Snowmass, CO and Scottsdale, AZ, as well as over 35 summers at Eaton's Ranch in Wolf, WY. An avid harmonica player, and former member of the Yale Glee Club, he was a lover of music and long-time governing member of The Chicago Symphony Orchestra and dedicated member of The Bohemian Grove Club. He is survived by his brother James H. Ingersoll of Florida, daughters, Nancy Reid Ingersoll Foster (married to Francis G. Foster Jr.), Gail Ann Ingersoll Ransom (married to Lawrence Bristol Ransom), and Elizabeth Gaylord Ingersoll Carroll (married to Paul Ingersoll Carroll), eleven grandchildren and twenty-one great-grandchildren as well as numerous nieces and nephews. He is predeceased by his wife Eleanor (d. 2001), and two daughters, Coralyn Eleanor Ingersoll Walker (d. 2003 married to Robert Giles Walker) and Joan Courtney Ingersoll (d. 1951). In lieu of flowers, gifts may be made to the University of Chicago and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Services celebrating his life will be held on Friday, September 17th at 3:30 pm at the Winnetka Congregational Church, 725 Pine St., Winnetka, IL."

Dexter Filkins covered Iraq for The Times from 2003 to 2006 and is the author of ''The Forever War.'' The morning of April 9, 2003, opened under a bright Baghdad sun. The American soldiers and Marines arrayed outside the capital stepped from the tents and palm groves where they'd slept and started the engines on their tanks. By first light, they were marching into Baghdad, rolling into Baghdad, liberators and conquerors both. It had taken only 21 days for the Americans to cross the Kuwait border, roll over Saddam Hussein's army and breach the Iraqi capital. They were a tide inexorable. Flowers and sweets awaited them. The war, it seemed, was almost over, and so soon after it had begun."

By recreating period design details like color, typeface and finish, Timex is paying homage to classic watch faces of the 20th century. The 1970s style features that serpentine, expandable, flexible metal watchband that was all the rage. The revolutionary band of interlocking links allows it to be stretched and slid over the hand, providing for one-size-fits-all functionality. Timex is taking a trip back in time to prove its credo that it does indeed take a licking and keep on ticking."

The Arkansas native came to New York in the 1980s to pursue painting but gave it up after the bohemian thing got boring. “I was just tired of being poor,” he says. Rowland went on to create two agencies — Women, in 1988, and Supreme, in 2000. Both were both known for dispensing with glam in favor of a more eclectic look. “At Supreme, the girls looked like Smith students — a little intellectual, a little odd looking,” he says."

This fun fact is one of hundreds in ‘‘Bespoke: The Men’s Style of Savile Row’’ (Rizzoli), a new tome as handsome as its subject. Up front, the author James Sherwood clears up any uncertainty fogging the much-abused term: To earn the label bespoke a garment must be measured, cut and sewn by hand; the pattern must also be hand-cut. When the pioneers of custom British tailoring took their first orders in the early 1800s, they were for clothes inspired by the ‘‘honest’’ wardrobe of the English country gentleman. In 1929 Hawkes & Co. did the unthinkable by introducing ‘‘immediate wear’’ to Savile Row, and by 1948, sales of the firm’s off-the-peg suits surpassed those of bespoke. It’s a trend that has never been reversed, though not for want of trying. In the ’90s, Richard Anderson, Ozwald Boateng and Richard James opened shops, forming what Sherwood tags ‘‘The New Establishment.’’ And Edward Sexton, Spencer Hart and Timothy Everest are currently powering a ‘‘Row Renaissance.’’ ‘‘Bespoke’’ is especially good on the crazy language peculiar to the Row. Who knew that a ‘‘tab’’ is a fussy customer, or a ‘‘crushed beetle’’ a badly made buttonhole?"

He made a swift and painless exit August 28, less than two weeks into his last act -- a cross-country move with Yvette to La Jolla, CA, to be with their children. A joyous, authentic Renaissance man, Herman was passionate about politics, great books, great art, great music...and the Yankees. As curious about people as about ideas and a tireless listener, he made you feel you were the most interesting person in the world. Herman was born in Union City, NJ, where he started out as a teacher and harnessed his radical commitment to fairness to form the district's first teachers' union; he retired as Assistant Superintendent of Schools, an inspiring leader who initiated lasting, innovative programs. He also owned and directed Camp Idylwold in Schroon Lake, NY, which was to become his beloved home base: he and Yvette tended and expanded the 1840s Bullet Pond farmhouse they bought in 1965; they remain honored senior residents of the town (as they do of Parliament House in Pompano Beach, FL, where they made their winter home). A President of the Schroon Lake Association for eleven years, Herman was devoted to keeping the lake pure for future generations. He was ""best father in the world"" to his daughter and very best friend to his son, both of whom grew up in Teaneck, NJ, except during the family sabbatical year in Paris and Rome that set the stage for Herman's next career, operating student tours, and for four decades of traveling the world. Herman lived long enough to experience in life the tributes accorded most of us only in eulogy tributes from his adoring extended family, his friends, and the generations of young people he mentored. Pre-deceased by siblings Morris and Lillian, he is survived by his brother Raymond and by nieces Tasha, Lisa, Melissa, Brooke, Mickey Rae, Renee, Cory and Vera, and by nephew Daniel. Herman will be remembered, as he was loved, for his enthusiastic unbounded spirit. We will cherish his legacy.

2010-09-02T00:00:00Z,"It's sign time. A restaurant needs a sign. The one I have in mind will have black lower-case letters painted on a piece of Philippine mahogany with a little light above it. It will stand in front of the building, in the garden, two-sided so you can see it when traveling north or south. Maybe it should be a black sign with white letters. We'll see. It will say Southfork Kitchen. That's the name of the restaurant. But first, a permit is needed. Southampton is very touchy about its signs -- shape, location, luminosity and content. When you attend enough planning board meetings, you get to hear the debates about sundry signage. One of my favorites involved a holistic veterinarian who wanted to use a bird on his sign. Members of the board wondered aloud if the proposed bird was an egret or a heron. That it looked like a stork, said one board member, might confuse the citizenry into thinking the doctor was an obstetrician, not a veterinarian. But a heron is a stork, argued a more ornithologically minded board member."

''The Story'' is followed by three coming-of-age tales: ''One Last Thing ...'' (2005), at 9:30, Alex Steyermark's bittersweet comedy about a 16-year-old (Michael Angarano, above) dying of cancer who makes a wish to spend a weekend with a surly, alcoholic supermodel (Sunny Mabrey). Cynthia Nixon also stars. In Natasha Arthy's ''Fighter'' (2007), at 11:15, the rebellious daughter (Semra Turan) of Turkish Muslims chooses kung-fu class over medical school. Ms. Turan, a kung fu champion, performs many of the film's action sequences, which were choreographed by Xian Gao, a martial arts trainer and actor on ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'' The evening closes with ''Quinceañera'' (2006), at 1 a.m., Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland's drama about a 14-year-old Mexican-American (Emily Rios) from Echo Park in Los Angeles, whose life is thrown into turmoil when she learns she is pregnant, even though she is technically a virgin."

Greene, a great humanitarian, devoted friend, and dedicated benefactor to generations of Columbia Law School students and faculty. Dawn and her late husband, Jerome L. Greene, a distinguished member of the Class of 1928, were towering figures in the history of Columbia Law School. To honor their generosity, the Law School named its flagship building -- the hub of its intellectual life -- Jerome Greene Hall. As president and CEO of the Jerome L. Greene Foundation, Dawn provided visionary leadership that further transformed Greene Hall into an international nexus for legal scholarship and pedagogy. Her gifts supported significant enhancements to our classrooms, faculty offices, and community spaces. In addition, Dawn made an indelible impact on our campus community. She established the Jerome L. Greene Professorship in Transactional Law, as well as the Greene scholarships, which have provided financial aid to more than 25 students each year since 1994. She also generously supported innovations in the Law School's clinical legal education program. We celebrate the life of a remarkable woman as we mourn the loss of our dear friend. We will remember fondly Dawn's generosity of spirit, her integrity, and her enduring devotion to Columbia Law School.

Time and again, Llodra slid in his wide lefty slice, forcing Berdych to reach on his two-handed backhand return. When Berdych would hit a solid return, Llodra handled the first volley with soft hands that recalled John McEnroe in his prime. He made difficult volleys look easy, often using exquisite touch to thwart Berdych, who returned from deep in the court. All told, Llodra made 75 forays to the net, winning 48 of them, often with a textbook first volley that Berdych could not run down."

This happens when the product of one replicator becomes copying machinery for the next replicator, and so on. Memes appeared, I wrote,  when humans (a product of genes) became capable of imitating, varying and selecting a new kind of information in the form of words, actions, technologies and ideas. The same thing is happening now, I argued, with a new replicator. Computers (a product of memes) are just beginning to be capable not only of copying but of copying, varying and selecting digital information. This means the birth of a new  replicator ─  temes, or technological memes."

It sounds plausible -- but it misses the key point: there's a fallacy of composition here. When everyone tries to pay off debt at the same time, the result is contraction and deflation, which ends up making the debt problem worse even if nominal debt falls. On the other hand, a strong fiscal stimulus, by expanding the economy and creating moderate inflation, can actually help resolve debt problems."

The Jonas Brothers were the band Connect 3, and Joe Jonas played a teenage pop sensation in search of the girl with the beautiful voice who is heard but not seen. This time there's a new camp across the lake, and it wants Camp Rock to go away. Can someone say duel of the bands? Frankie Jonas -- the younger brother of Nick, Joe and Kevin (above, from left) -- joins in the commotion.

He made a swift and painless exit August 28, less than two weeks into his last act -- a cross-country move with Yvette to La Jolla, CA, to be with their children. A joyous, authentic Renaissance man, Herman was passionate about politics, great books, great art, great music...and the Yankees. As curious about people as about ideas and a tireless listener, he made you feel you were the most interesting person in the world. Herman was born in Union City, NJ, where he started out as a teacher and harnessed his radical commitment to fairness to form the district's first teachers' union; he retired as Assistant Superintendent of Schools, an inspiring leader who initiated lasting, innovative programs. He also owned and directed Camp Idylwold in Schroon Lake, NY, which was to become his beloved home base: he and Yvette tended and expanded the 1840s Bullet Pond farmhouse they bought in 1965; they remain honored senior residents of the town (as they do of Parliament House in Pompano Beach, FL, where they made their winter home). A President of the Schroon Lake Association for eleven years, Herman was devoted to keeping the lake pure for future generations. He was ""best father in the world"" to his daughter and very best friend to his son, both of whom grew up in Teaneck, NJ, except during the family sabbatical year in Paris and Rome that set the stage for Herman's next career, operating student tours, and for four decades of traveling the world. Herman lived long enough to experience in life the tributes accorded most of us only in eulogy tributes from his adoring extended family, his friends, and the generations of young people he mentored. Pre-deceased by siblings Morris and Lillian, he is survived by his brother Raymond and by nieces Tasha, Lisa, Melissa, Brooke, Mickey Rae, Renee, Cory and Vera, and by nephew Daniel. Herman will be remembered, as he was loved, for his enthusiastic unbounded spirit. We will cherish his legacy. Contributions in his memory will be welcomed by the Schroon Lake Association or the Seagle Music Colony, both of Schroon Lake, NY, 12870."

2010-09-04T22:59:08Z,"Watching Favre-a-thon 2010 unfold, the Packers might have stifled a giggle. They should not even pay attention. Green Bay is a Super Bowl-caliber team no matter what Favre does because General Manager Ted Thompson made the right bet at the right time on Aaron Rodgers, who is one of the top five quarterbacks in the league and looked particularly sharp in the preseason. If his line does not get Rodgers killed, the way it nearly did early last season, the offense will again be one of the most productive in the N.F.L. (The Packers were third in points scored last season.) The defense was seventh in points allowed, and although Al Harris and Charles Woodson are among the best cornerback tandems in the league, they are each at least 33 and injuries are taking a toll. Harris (knee) is on the physically unable to perform list and unavailable for at least six games. The best news for the Packers is that the schedule offers a relatively easy first six games before they play the Vikings, the Jets and the Cowboys in a row. After a bye, they face the Vikings, the Falcons and the 49ers."
2010-09-04T22:17:31Z,"ATLANTA -- It seems like a risky move for a team to use its star cornerback, an All-American candidate no less, as a kick returner.

2010-09-04T20:52:27Z,"TELLURIDE, Colo.- One of the open-air panels at the Telluride film festival this year is called ""Human/Nature,"" about how filmmakers address the natural world, and it's an apt subject, both because of the festival's setting and because of one of the themes that links a number of selections in the program. Nestled in a high mountain valley surrounded by jagged, soaring peaks, Telluride, a former mining town, frequently upstages the movies on its screens, at least as far as sheer visual sublimity is concerned."
2010-09-04T20:45:32Z,"Did 49ers Coach Mike Singletary annoy someone in the scheduling office? The Niners open with three of their first four games on the road, with the home game against the Saints. Still, this is a team on the rise after finishing 8-8 last season, coupling a premier N.F.L. defense (fourth best in points allowed in 2009) with the hope that quarterback Alex Smith will make a big leap by playing the same offense for two consecutive years. Smith is surrounded by plenty of talent, including tight end Vernon Davis and the emerging receiver Michael Crabtree. Do not look for Smith to finally get to use the spread offense he prefers, though. Singletary wants to be an old-school, smash-mouth team - he defined that style as a player - and the Niners upgraded their offensive line in the draft to that end. Their schedule will not make it easy - they also play a ""home"" game in London and play the Cardinals twice late in the season - but the Niners should get above .500 for the first time since 2002, and that may be enough to win the division."

2010-09-04T16:28:22Z,"The N.F.L. has planned a parade in New Orleans on Thursday, the day of the season opener, which is a good way to remind the Saints that the party is over. As loaded as they remain, the Saints will have to guard against complacency and the fact that every opponent that will be trying to take down the champions. The Saints' task will be made easier by the virtually intact offense of Drew Brees and his nearly unstoppable passing game. Brees was transcendent in the Super Bowl, and the Saints led the league in points last season. They also topped the league in scoring differential, despite a defense that finished 20th in points allowed. We will know plenty about the way the Saints handle the hangover when they open against Minnesota in an N.F.C. championship game rematch. After that, the schedule is manageable enough to at least ensure a return playoff trip, if not the division title."

As long as Peyton Manning is upright, the Colts are a Super Bowl contender. Bill Polian, the Colts' president, has surrounded Manning with superb talent, so much so that Indianapolis's 2007 first-round draft pick, Anthony Gonzalez, could be the odd man out in a fabulous group of receivers. The offensive line has gotten much bigger with the hopes of establishing a ground game, but how much does that really matter? Manning threw 571 passes last year and was a coach's decision from leading Indianapolis to a likely undefeated regular season. The defense, which allowed fewer than 20 points a game, should be better in Year 2 under Larry Coyer because Bob Sanders, a supremely gifted safety, is healthy again. The only problem the Colts face is that the expectations are so high, if they don't win it all, the season will be a huge disappointment. They will reach at least the A.F.C. championship game."

For all the off-season turmoil - whither Vincent Jackson and his holdout? - San Diego has the most talent by far. The passing game, even without Jackson, is deep and explosive and figures only to get better now that teams have to pay attention to Ryan Mathews instead of LaDainian Tomlinson, who led the 31st-ranked rushing offense last season. Still, you get the feeling the window is about to close on this team. Several big names, like linebacker Shawne Merriman and returner Darren Sproles, are in their contract years, and the Chargers simply can't keep racing through the regular season (they won their final 11 games in 2009 and have one of the easiest schedules this season) only to collapse in the playoffs. Last season's lackluster playoff loss to the Jets might be pinned on Norv Turner's insistence on giving the ball to Tomlinson, but the excuses, and the Chargers' dominance, are running out. San Diego should win the division again with ease, but every other team is aggressively trying to improve in the meantime."

If the new cornerback Antonio Cromartie can return to his 2007 form and Darrelle Revis ends his holdout, the Jets will have the best secondary, and the best defense, in football. The first-team offense struggled in the preseason; Mark Sanchez still makes too many mistakes, and the offensive line looked spotty. But the surprise was how much life appeared in LaDainian Tomlinson's legs. The real issue is that with so many big mouths and big egos, the Jets have raised expectations wildly and made themselves a target. In a closely bunched division, how well all those big names work together may determine whether the Jets are a well-publicized boom or bust."

2010-09-05T00:00:00Z,"LEARSON--Kate. Our beloved friend, Kate Learson, died on Tuesday. Her heartbreaking absence from our lives will leave us forever diminished. But through our tears we know that we have been forever graced by her love, her unfailing kindness, and her contagious passion for art, poetry and opera. Kate found delight in life and never stopped fighting for more, even when up against impossible odds. She loved her family above all; her sons, Doug and Lucien Foster, her daughter-in-law, Rebecca Foster, and her precious grandson, Rowan, who was her joy. During her final years, Kate also felt blessed by the steadfast love of Nita. We will deeply miss everything about Kate; especially her irreverent humor and spontaneous wit which never left her and was integral to her joie de vivre. While Kate reveled in her exotic travels to places like Antarctica and Angor Wat, she was just as happy in front of her fireplace with family or friends, or watching Max, her black standard poodle, fly down the beach in Chatham, Massachusetts. Kate loved the Cape and her boundless love, like the ocean she cherished, was, and will continue to be, an endless source of strength for us all.

2010-09-05T00:00:00Z,"About a decade ago transplanted Manhattanites began reviving the late-18th-century whaling town of Hudson, N.Y., two hours north of New York City, along the Hudson River. Initially, proximity, great building stock and cheap rents spurred a healthy antiques district. More recently galleries, bars and vintage shops have opened; along with them a general feeling of bohemianism has emerged. The latest wave to hit, particularly along the main drag of Warren Street, has been music. Already home to established musicians like the neo-soul singer and musician Meshell Ndegeocello, the D.J. Tedd Patterson, and the bassist Melissa Auf der Maur, formerly of the band Hole -- as well as a recording studio housed in an 1869 church -- Hudson now boasts a robust grassroots music scene.

2010-09-05T00:00:00Z,"The first month of a college football season is filled with teams from lesser-known conferences traveling to play teams from powerful ones. They are known as guarantee games, in which the road teams receive a guaranteed paycheck and often a guaranteed loss. When Boise State faces Virginia Tech on Monday, it will be a different kind of guarantee game. The Broncos are receiving $1.25 million to travel to FedEx Field in Landover, Md., a neutral site much closer to Tech's Blacksburg campus. But Virginia Tech will not return the favor by traveling to Idaho next year. Of course, Boise State is also ranked No. 3 and favored to win the game.

2010-09-05T00:00:00Z,"The Ravens spent the off-season shoring up their offense, handing quarterback Joe Flacco the best receiving corps he has had by adding Anquan Boldin and Donte' Stallworth, who recently broke his foot but is expected to return in October. Combine them with running back Ray Rice's explosiveness, and the Ravens have real scoring potential -- a good thing after they managed only 3 points against the Colts in the playoffs last season. That would usually be enough to make the Ravens a Super Bowl favorite without reservation. But their reliable defense has some problems, particularly in the secondary. Safety Ed Reed (neck) is on the physically unable to perform list, so he will miss at least six weeks. At cornerback, Domonique Foxworth is out for the season and Fabian Washington and Lardarius Webb are returning from serious knee injuries. Maybe the rest of the defense -- with Haloti Ngata, Terrence Cody, the 35-year-old Ray Lewis and a slimmed-down and quicker Terrell Suggs -- is still special enough that it will not matter."

When I look up -- though these days one no longer looks up from his work, but merely past the monitor -- I see only the spines of books along their shelves. What I don't see is the pitched window of the attic, the bend that the Spree, Berlin's main river, makes behind me, the distant facade of the magnificent Bode Museum; above all I don't see the three bridges with their streams of cars and pedestrians under which pass huge barges headed in both directions. Some of the barges carry freight, while others blast music as people dance and raise beer bottles on the deck, although on most of them sit tourists with their cameras, attentive as schoolchildren. I always wonder what they are photographing. The majority probably photograph the so-called Palace of Tears, that glass border-crossing station that once sat between East and West Berlin; today it is empty, although it will soon become a dance club. A few will also photograph the Berlin Ensemble, originally a theater founded and run by Bertolt Brecht; it is to the left of my window and visible only if I lean out. The most important thing, however, cannot be photographed: the invisible line where the Berlin Wall once stood. Absence can't be captured, not even with the best camera, and so the tourists turn their helpless devices to the gray facades of the new buildings, to the rows of identical windows, one of which, high up near the roof, stands open, and behind it a barely visible figure quickly turns away and goes back to work at his desk."

2010-09-05T00:00:00Z,"The N.F.L. has planned a parade in New Orleans on Thursday, the day of the season opener, which is a good way to remind the Saints that the party is over. As loaded as they remain, the Saints will have to guard against complacency and the fact that every opponent that will be trying to take down the champions. The Saints' task will be made easier by the virtually intact offense of Drew Brees and his nearly unstoppable passing game. Brees was transcendent in the Super Bowl, and the Saints led the league in points last season. They also topped the league in scoring differential, despite a defense that finished 20th in points allowed. We will know plenty about the way the Saints handle the hangover when they open against Minnesota in an N.F.C. championship game rematch. After that, the schedule is manageable enough to at least ensure a return playoff trip, if not the division title. The only real competition for the Saints in the division is the Falcons, who are sure to be improved because the odds are against having their two most important offensive players hurt again. Most crucial to the bounce-back is Matt Ryan, who threw 14 interceptions and 22 touchdown passes last season. Running back Michael Turner, who was hurt for the second half of 2009, is also back, joining a strong three-pronged running attack. The Falcons' biggest off-season move was the signing of cornerback Dunta Robinson, a needed upgrade for the pass defense. Atlanta also got a break when defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux, who had six sacks last season, was suspended for only one game after violating the league's substance-abuse policy. That game is against Pittsburgh, which will be without the suspended quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The Falcons won nine games with Ryan and Turner missing time. Ten victories and at least a wild-card spot seem in easy reach."

2010-09-05T00:00:00Z,"Did 49ers Coach Mike Singletary annoy someone in the scheduling office? The Niners open with three of their first four games on the road, with the home game against the Saints. Still, this is a team on the rise after finishing 8-8 last season, coupling a premier N.F.L. defense (fourth best in points allowed in 2009) with the hope that quarterback Alex Smith will make a big leap by playing the same offense for two consecutive years. Smith is surrounded by plenty of talent, including tight end Vernon Davis and the emerging receiver Michael Crabtree. Do not look for Smith to finally get to use the spread offense he prefers, though. Singletary wants to be an old-school, smash-mouth team - he defined that style as a player - and the Niners upgraded their offensive line in the draft to that end. Their schedule will not make it easy - they also play a ''home'' game in London and play the Cardinals twice late in the season - but the Niners should get above .500 for the first time since 2002, and that may be enough to win the division. You have to wonder if the Cardinals have begged Kurt Warner to put his retirement papers through a shredder instead of in the mail to the league office. Arizona was being written off because of Warner's departure and the roster churn that included the losses of Antrel Rolle, Anquan Boldin and Karlos Dansby. Then Matt Leinart failed in his latest chance to secure the starting quarterback job. Derek Anderson offers the possibility of explosive plays, but the Cardinals are unlikely to generate Warner-like point totals. So it will be up to the running tandem of Beanie Wells and Tim Hightower to power the offense. Weeks 4 and 5, against the Chargers and the Saints, will show whether Arizona can score enough to remain in the playoff picture."

But he was, in fact, Swiss, and born in this town in the Jura Mountains of northern Switzerland on Dec. 25, 1878. But he is largely unremembered here; the house in which he was born has long since been torn down. And folks at the tourist office responded with ''who?'' when I asked about him on a recent visit. But on Aug. 27 and 28, a small but ardent band of admirers gathered here to remember him and to hold an event in his honor that was attended by an estimated 3,000 people."

G., New York A.I contacted Sarah Wildman, who has written several articles about Vienna for the Travel section, including ''36 Hours in Vienna'' (June 15, 2008). In an e-mail, she recommended the grand New Year's Eve Kaiserball (kaiserball.com) at the Hofburg Imperial Palace, which she mentioned in her article, ''Putting on the White Tie and Gown'' (Dec. 23, 2007), about Vienna's ball season. Tickets start at 140 euros, without table reservation; admission at 9:45 p.m. (students are 60 euros). She also suggested dinner at Vestibul (vestibuel.at) in the Burgtheater.

2010-09-05T00:00:00Z,"Eight of the last 11 Super Bowl losers failed to qualify for the playoffs the next season. Get serious. As long as Peyton Manning is upright, the Colts are a Super Bowl contender. Bill Polian, the Colts' president, has surrounded Manning with superb talent, so much so that Indianapolis's 2007 first-round draft pick, Anthony Gonzalez, could be the odd man out in a fabulous group of receivers. The offensive line has gotten much bigger with the hopes of establishing a ground game, but how much does that really matter? Manning threw 571 passes last year and was a coach's decision from leading Indianapolis to a likely undefeated regular season. The defense, which allowed fewer than 20 points a game, should be better in Year 2 under Larry Coyer because Bob Sanders, a supremely gifted safety, is healthy again. The only problem the Colts face is that the expectations are so high, if they don't win it all, the season will be a huge disappointment. They will reach at least the A.F.C. championship game. Assume that the Titans are not going to start the season 0-6 again. Vince Young will be the quarterback from the first snap, and the Titans managed an 8-2 run to finish last season. Chris Johnson is unlikely to run for 2,000 yards again, and losing tight end Alge Crumpler and his blocking to New England could hinder Johnson. Still, the offense is good enough to overcome a defense that was a disaster last season after losing the coordinator Jim Schwartz and defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth. Tennessee loaded up on defensive players in the draft. They will have to come together quickly to make up for the losses of linebacker Keith Bulluck and defensive end Kyle Vanden Bosch to free agency, but if they do, the Titans could be a wild-card team."

2010-09-05T00:00:00Z,"When will the rest of the A.F.C. West give the Chargers a run for the division title? Not this year. For all the off-season turmoil -- whither Vincent Jackson and his holdout? -- San Diego has the most talent by far. The passing game, even without Jackson, is deep and explosive and figures only to get better now that teams have to pay attention to Ryan Mathews instead of LaDainian Tomlinson, who led the 31st-ranked rushing offense last season. Still, you get the feeling the window is about to close on this team. Several big names, like linebacker Shawne Merriman and returner Darren Sproles, are in their contract years, and the Chargers simply can't keep racing through the regular season (they won their final 11 games in 2009 and have one of the easiest schedules this season) only to collapse in the playoffs. Last season's lackluster playoff loss to the Jets might be pinned on Norv Turner's insistence on giving the ball to Tomlinson, but the excuses, and the Chargers' dominance, are running out. San Diego should win the division again with ease, but every other team is aggressively trying to improve in the meantime. The Broncos would have had a much better chance of challenging the Chargers if the Pro Bowl linebacker Elvis Dumervil, the league's sack leader in 2009, had not torn a pectoral muscle in training camp. That season-ending injury will put extreme pressure on a superb secondary that includes Brian Dawkins and Champ Bailey. Denver's run defense ranked 26th last season, and the front seven has been made over. Still, the biggest question marks are all over the offense after the Broncos traded Brandon Marshall and Tony Scheffler, then drafted Tim Tebow. And left tackle Ryan Clady tore a patellar tendon in the spring, endangering his chances of being ready for the first game. Kyle Orton received a preseason contract extension, a testament to his fine performance and an attempt to forestall what seemed an inevitable quarterback controversy. Orton will be the starter this year, with Tebow used in designated situations, including at the goal line. For Orton and a reconstituted offense, that might be a hollow victory."

2010-09-05T00:00:00Z,"How concerned should the Cowboys be about preseason injuries, particularly on the line for an already somnolent offense? Plenty. The Cowboys are deep, talented and balanced, built to win a title, but injuries could quickly derail all of that. The Cowboys have a powerful running back group, and quarterback Tony Romo has many receiving options, especially if the rookie Dez Bryant returns to full speed after his high ankle sprain early in training camp. The Dallas defense remains a powerhouse, with linebacker DeMarcus Ware among the N.F.L.'s best defensive players. The Cowboys even shed their dreaded postseason curse last season, winning a wild-card game. But the N.F.C. East is always brutal, and the Cowboys' out-of-division schedule includes games at Minnesota, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Arizona, and a home game against New Orleans. The Cowboys may win the division, but getting the best conference record to gain home-field advantage and a first-round bye in the playoffs will be much more difficult."

With two on and no outs, Joba Chamberlain caught Jose Bautista looking at a slider for strike three - except that the pitch appeared to be several inches outside. Bautista erupted and was ejected, and the next hitter, Vernon Wells, grounded into a double play. With two outs in the bottom of the inning, Marcus Thames hit his seventh homer in 10 games, and the Yankees went on to win, 7-5."

2010-09-05T00:00:00Z,"Watching Favre-a-thon 2010 unfold, the Packers might have stifled a giggle. They should not even pay attention. Green Bay is a Super Bowl-caliber team no matter what Favre does because General Manager Ted Thompson made the right bet at the right time on Aaron Rodgers, who is one of the top five quarterbacks in the league and looked particularly sharp in the preseason. If his line does not get Rodgers killed, the way it nearly did early last season, the offense will again be one of the most productive in the N.F.L. (The Packers were third in points scored last season.) The defense was seventh in points allowed, and although Al Harris and Charles Woodson are among the best cornerback tandems in the league, they are each at least 33 and injuries are taking a toll. Harris (knee) is on the physically unable to perform list and unavailable for at least six games. The best news for the Packers is that the schedule offers a relatively easy first six games before they play the Vikings, the Jets and the Cowboys in a row. After a bye, they face the Vikings, the Falcons and the 49ers. The Vikings do not particularly care that the rest of the league was astonished at the spectacle of their sending three players to cajole a colleague to come to work. If Brett Favre is anything close to what he was last season (33 touchdown passes, 7 interceptions) and if they can get Adrian Peterson to stop fumbling (seven last season), Minnesota has a chance to go deep in the playoffs. But Favre's job will probably be much tougher this season. His ankle is not well; his go-to receiver, Sidney Rice, is out for at least six games after hip surgery; and the speedy receiver Percy Harvin struggled during the preseason with migraines that have plagued him since childhood. The Vikings have to bank on offense because the defense is aging, the Packers are young and stacked, and the schedule is brutal (games against the Saints, the Jets and the Cowboys in the first six weeks). If this is Favre's last season - get back to us at this time next year - the Vikings are the ultimate win-now team. But they will need more than a wild card and a playoff road game to finally win a championship."

2010-09-05T00:00:00Z,"It has been a long time since their rival in New England did not enter the season as the A.F.C. East favorite, but the Jets may engineer a hostile takeover. If the new cornerback Antonio Cromartie can return to his 2007 form and Darrelle Revis ends his holdout, the Jets will have the best secondary, and the best defense, in football. The first-team offense struggled in the preseason; Mark Sanchez still makes too many mistakes, and the offensive line looked spotty. But the surprise was how much life appeared in LaDainian Tomlinson's legs. The real issue is that with so many big mouths and big egos, the Jets have raised expectations wildly and made themselves a target. In a closely bunched division, how well all those big names work together may determine whether the Jets are a well-publicized boom or bust. During training camp, one of the Patriots said, with eyebrows arched, ''Have you bought your Jets Super Bowl tickets yet?'' New England will not go quietly. The offense got the best news with the stunningly quick return from knee surgery of receiver Wes Welker, the outstanding training camp of Randy Moss (yes, he is in a contract year), the revival of the running game, and the impressive preseason of the rookie tight end Aaron Hernandez. But New England has issues on the offensive line, where guard Logan Mankins shows no sign of ending his holdout, and his backup, Nick Kaczur, had back surgery that could end his season. The defense, in search of a consistent pass rush, has suffered huge blows, with defensive end Ty Warren (hip) and cornerback Leigh Bodden (shoulder) lost for the season. The Patriots' young defensive backs, now thrust into more crucial roles with Bodden gone, looked promising in the preseason, a good sign considering the defense uncharacteristically struggled to hold late leads last season. But whether Bill Belichick can devise another slightly under-the-radar blue-collar special like the three that won Super Bowls will determine if the torch gets passed to the Jets."

A.I suggest splitting your time between Venice and Florence, as Rome requires at least a week to see properly (and this will give you an excuse to return). The best way to travel in Italy is by train or car. From Venice's Santa Lucia station, it is a two- or three-hour train ride to Florence (raileurope.com). Or you can rent a car after you leave Venice and make the three-hour drive to Florence. From Florence you can take the train to Naples. The drive from Venice to Naples is seven to eight hours."

How long ago was it that the working man wore a solid blue suit with a white shirt and a tie, carried an attache case instead of a knapsack or messenger bag, got to the office at 9 a.m. and left promptly at 5 p.m.?

Evan, who is the son of David Yurman, might very well be describing the company’s brand-new Classic 1957 Limited Edition watch, a sporty, elegant and, yes, gentlemanly timepiece that was inspired by cars from the ’50s and the Thunderbird’s instrument panel in particular. ‘‘I drive these kinds of cars a lot, and I’m always staring at the speedometer to see where I’m at,’’ he says. For Yurman, the ’50s were the golden era of American design, and not just in the automobile industry. ‘‘I tip my hat to it and hope I can only add to this legacy.’’ When it comes to cars, however, it’s ultimately what’s under the hood that gets him revved up: he loves the ’57 T-Bird for its beauty more than its brawn. ‘‘It is a cruiser, a cream puff,’’ says Yurman, who instead owns a ’66 Bel Air and a ’69 Ford Mustang. ‘‘I go for the one where some guy in the factory said, ‘Let’s make this car as fast as we can.’ ’’"

(TCM) STAR OF THE MONTH: VIVIEN LEIGH Considered by many to be the movie industry's most beautiful actress, Leigh, left, preferred working in the theater and made only 20 films. But though her life appeared to be charmed, with a 20-year marriage to Laurence Olivier and two best actress Oscars, she battled bipolar disorder and eventually died of tuberculosis at 53. This 15-film tribute, shown on Tuesdays in September, begins with ''Vivien Leigh: Scarlett and Beyond,'' Gene Feldman and Suzette Winter's 1990 documentary, featuring archival footage of Leigh addressing British troops during World War II and relaxing with Olivier at their country estate. The evening continues with ''Dark Journey'' (1937), at 9, starring Leigh in her first leading role, as a French spy who falls for her German counterpart (Conrad Veidt); the screwball comedy ''Storm in a Teacup'' (1937), at 10:30, in which she plays a headstrong heiress tamed by love; and ''St. Martin's Lane'' (1940), at midnight, about a street performer (Charles Laughton) who helps an enticing pickpocket (Leigh) forge a new career as a dancer. That film, originally released in 1938 as ''Sidewalks of London,'' was Leigh's final steppingstone to winning the role of Scarlett O'Hara opposite Clark Gable in ''Gone With the Wind'' (1939). 8 P.M.

2010-09-08T00:00:00Z,"As the N.F.L. prepares to kick off its 2010 season, nearly all of the league's 31 football stadiums are financed with public money. On average, more than half the reported building costs of all active stadiums has been paid for with tax dollars -- for a collective total of $8 billion -- and in several instances, taxpayers have footed the entire bill. In contrast, the new Meadowlands Stadium was financed solely with private money, although taxpayers still owe on its predecessor, which was demolished this year. Unwinding the public cost of subsidized stadiums and arenas is difficult because of the complex mix of financing and accounting involved. Bonds, grants and other sources of taxpayer money may have been tapped to build a facility. Multiple levels of government may have pitched in. In most cases, the initial debt is refinanced one or more times, pushing the payback into the future. And frequently, millions more are spent to improve the original structure."

I learned that sloe berries are a type of wild plum, the fruit of a shrub called a blackthorn tree that grows in hedgerows in England.

2010-09-09T05:55:59Z,"""The Favre Indecision"" may sound like a Robert Ludlum novel, but it's really the story of the Vikings' off-season. Brett Favre is back in the Vikings huddle, but the Vikings have major questions that go beyond Favre's gimpy ankle. Their receiving corps is thin in the wake of Sidney Rice's injury, their big-name offensive line looked like a colander during the preseason, and the star running back Adrian Peterson is coming off a three-fumble performance in the Vikings' 31-28 loss to the Saints in the N.F.C. title game. Despite his age and eroded approval rating, Favre retains the power to relegate the defending champions to the second paragraph.The Saints are as unassuming as Super Bowl winners get. Minor scandals nip at their heels (Reggie Bush's Heisman trophy is being melted by the N.C.A.A. and recast as a Yoke of Shame), but the most succulent story to stick to the team has been Sean Payton's affinity for fruit-flavored gum.

2010-09-09T00:00:00Z,"MAUER--Anthony Sheridan, of Virginia Beach, VA, passed away peacefully at home on September 3, 2010. Born in Detroit on March 5, 1943 to the late Gertrude S. and Raymond J. Mauer, Tony grew up in Old Greenwich and Riverside, CT, and attended St. Mary's High School in Greenwich, CT. An avid outdoorsman, at the age of 13 Tony became an Eagle Scout, at the time the youngest ever in Greenwich. Tony graduated from the University of Connecticut where, as a walk-on, he played four years of college football, both offense and defense. A newspaper clipping quotes his coach as saying, ""Pound for pound, Tony is as tough as anyone on this team."" Upon graduating, Tony moved to New York City, and tried his hand at acting. He appeared off-Broadway in Friends, and later appeared in movies such as Goodbye, Columbus and The Godfather, as well as on television in such dramas as The Edge of Night. Moving to the other side of the lens, Tony proved to be a gifted, internationally recognized photographer. His professional credits include pieces published in Life, McCall's, Redbook and many other consumer and trade magazines, and portraits of many distinguished public figures and dignitaries. Tony was the official photographer for the Theater Hall of Fame in New York City, where he photographed many celebrities such as Lillian Gish, Grace Kelly, Al Pacino, Geroge C. Scott, etc. He also photographed The Christopher Awards for many years in NYC. His portraits are remarkable in that the subject always seems to express something very personal.

2010-09-09T00:00:00Z,"KLUGE--John W. The President and Trustees of Columbia University mourn the loss of a beloved member of the Columbia community and our greatest benefactor -- John Kluge, Columbia College class of 1937. John, who passed away at the age of 95, always retained his first-hand understanding of the catalytic effect a Columbia education could have on a young person's life, and he was determined to ensure that as many students as possible benefit from a similar opportunity. His gifts have funded, and will continue to fund, the education of thousands of deserving students who, like John himself, come from modest backgrounds. His historic 2007 gift of $400 million, still the largest ever to any college or university for financial aid, provides $200 million in financial aid endowment for undergraduates in Columbia College and another $200 million for students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Graduate School of Journalism, School of the Arts, and School of International and Public Affairs. John had made prior gifts totaling $110 million, the bulk of which was used to establish the Kluge Scholars Program to ensure access for talented and diverse Columbia College students of limited financial means. A recipient of an honorary doctorate from the University and the John Jay Award and Alexander Hamilton Medal from Columbia College, John will forever remain a figure of signal importance in the life and work of this University. We send our deepest condolences to his wife, Maria ""Tussi"" Kluge, his three children, Joseph, Samantha, John Kluge II (Columbia College class of 2005), and the entire family. Lee C. Bollinger, President, and The Trustees of Columbia University"

Minutes after the party's outset, guests already had gathered around the bar at the landing, including Mr. Franzen himself, calm and genial in a dark gray suit and pale blue shirt, equably chatting with his girlfriend, Kathryn Chetkovich; and Mark Costello, the novelist husband of the editor in chief of Scribner, Nan Graham. Ms. Graham, in a chic cloud-blue dress, stood at the bar, talking with Deborah Treisman, the New Yorker's elegant fiction editor, who helped secure Mr. Franzen's inclusion in the New Yorker's showcase of emerging novelists in 1999, in an issue called ''The Future of American Fiction.''"

Mr. Gates appears in the film, and, with his wife Melinda, heads a foundation that has invested heavily in improvements to education. But his aw-shucks manner couldn't hide the fact that some of the proposals he tossed off on stage at the Winter Garden theater here were volatile stuff. ""We're investing in building these evaluation systems,"" Mr. Gates said. He was referring to systems that would evaluate the performance of public school teachers, with an eye toward ending the current tenure system under which many teachers now work, and providing a way to weed out the worst teachers, while, perhaps, rewarding the best.

Paul Wilson, the company's artistic director, created two distinct looks to demonstrate the line's versatility. While manipulating a model's thick, curly locks, Wilson said that the first style, which was sleekly molded and sculpted close to the head, showed off ""shorter, groomed, tamed and really shiny hair."" To sharply contrast that look, he created a second style that sported ""full, lived in, dry-textured hair."" A tandem exercise in style extremes, the models' hair complemented Duckie Brown's spring fashions, which ranged from tailored trousers in muted tones to eye-popping bug print shirts. The Curl and Boost system, which is comprised of Curl Control (tames rough, unruly hair), Curl Construct (defines and shapes curls), Boost Powder (mattifies and builds texture), and Boost Cream (lifts thin hair to new heights), sell for $17.95 each and will be available at authorized American Crew salons beginning in January 2011."

Contorting acrylic tubing around colorful enamel chords, Auerbach created a spiraling sculpture-like necklace and chose polished lucite and elastic bracelets. ""I wanted to use a lot of clear material so that I could make big pieces that wouldn't be too dominating,"" she says. ""I thought it would be interesting to see the clothes through the jewelry, and to make certain parts of the pieces like the elastic on the bracelets appear suspended in the air around the models' wrists. I chose Lucite because it was durable and I could form it myself."" Our hypothesis?

Wang's downtown gallerina was clad in sheer fabrics, optic white denim and wide-cut pants, paired with a no-look look that had beauty editors scratching their heads. ""There isn't really much makeup today,"" said Kendal with a wry grin. She bleached brows by applying Wella Wellite Powder Lightener with a makeup brush ""to keep the girls looking cool""-with the exception of Agyness Deyn, who apparently wasn't up for a color change. And on the rest of the face? ""Just concealer where needed and moisturizer. We wanted the skin to look shiny."" Over at the hair station, Palau said he ""didn't want hair color to stand out"" and get in the way of the identity of Wang's ""new-age traveler woman."" To make the look uniform, he mixed Fuller's Earth Clay-a cosmetic clay often used in DIY skincare recipes and that is also the main ingredient in popular 1940's hair powder Minipoo-with white pigment and slicked the concoction through the hair. The resulting look was futuristic on models (including runway vets Karen Elson, Omahrya Mota and Karolina Kurkova), but in reality would look like someone in the middle of undergoing a double process (perhaps to emerge as the grey-haired woman seen earlier today at Cynthia Rowley). The nails, filed to a rounded shape, also appeared peculiarly half-done: manicurists applied one coat of Butter London Nail Foundation Flawless Basecoat followed by two coats of the brand's Matte Finish Topcoat. The overall effect was certainly a look, and indeed, one best pulled off by a young art star, down to the late-breaking addition of faux rose gold septum rings."

2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,"Part of the pleasure in watching the six documentaries that Albert and David Maysles made, beginning in the early 1970s, about some of the huge environmental installations by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, is seeing how the entire process of obtaining permits and winning over public opinion opens up a democratic debate on art. (A debate taking place right now about Christo's proposed project for the Arkansas River in Colorado.) In the latest film, ''The Gates,'' about a project that began in 1979 and ended in February 2005 in Manhattan when a golden river of banners floated over the walkways of Central Park for two weeks, we hear arguments that have become depressingly familiar to anyone who has followed the work of Christo and Jeanne-Claude. There's the defacement tack, epitomized here by a woman who says that allowing ''The Gates'' in the park is akin to Picasso painting ''Guernica'' over ''The Last Supper.'' (If the park were a work of art in that way, then allowing anyone to walk in it would be an act of vandalism.) And then there is the moralistic stance, that surely there must be a more useful way to spend the millions of dollars that Christo raises to finance each project."

2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,"When an actor who has had great success in light, comic roles decides his work has been froth and sets out to do something with ''meaning,'' the results are often dispiriting. There are exceptions, like Steve Martin in ''Pennies From Heaven,'' but generally it's no fun to watch talented people undervalue the qualities that made them a pleasure to watch in the first place. ''None but the Lonely Heart'' could have been one of those missteps. Cary Grant, the former Archibald Leach, felt an affinity with Ernie Mott, the cockney vagabond hero of Richard Llewellyn's novel and hired his friend the playwright Clifford Odets to adapt it for the film (for which Odets also made his directorial debut). It's a remarkable movie, unfulfilled on some level but also uncompromised. You can see why it didn't attract audiences and why the people who have seen it speak about it in the tone reserved for films that imprint themselves on your memory."

2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,"A COMPANY MAN In 2008, when Kim Jones was named the creative director of Alfred Dunhill, the fashion establishment responded with a resounding ''Huh?'' Jones, as The Times of London put it, was ''more club kid than clubman.'' He loved big sneakers, loud prints, hip-hop and a wee bit of bling. He cavorted with Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Kanye West. He made neckties out of puffy nylon and once stamped black circles onto a model's nipples. Sure, he had bona fides -- Central Saint Martins, stints at Louis Vuitton and Hugo Boss. But this was Dunhill, a Jermyn Street staple, a heritage brand. Cathy Horyn, the New York Times fashion critic, was less than enthusiastic about Jones's first efforts, but after a tentative start he has consistently garnered raves. The British Fashion Council has awarded him men's-wear designer of of the year twice -- both as an independent designer and, in 2009, for his work at Dunhill. ''It's a beautiful brand, but it was sort of a sleeping beauty,'' says the 31-year-old Jones, whose eclectic edge has given the house a wake-up call."

2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,"If Steven Shainberg's ''Secretary'' -- loosely adapted from a Mary Gaitskill story -- were just a nice little movie about spanking, it might easily be relegated to the kitsch dustbin. Instead it's a fairy tale about erotic love and the deepest mysteries of sexual desire, with a happy ending in which two sad, sorry misfits find they complement each other perfectly. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays an awkward, repressed young woman who has just been sprung from a mental institution. She's a cutter, and her favored implement is a relic of girlhood with sinister overtones, a plastic ballerina figurine whose toe shoe has been sharpened to a stiletto point. James Spader is the jittery lawyer who hires her to work in his small, extremely underpopulated office. All he wants her to do is answer the phones and type letters on a clackety old electric typewriter. Before long he's circling his new hire's typing mistakes with red marker and spanking her bottom soundly for each one. Her response surprises her. She experiences more joy than she's ever felt in her life."

The autocentric theme park, next to the Yas Marina Circuit racetrack, will offer more than 20 action-packed attractions under its manta-ray-shaped, two-million-square-foot roof. Sure to be a big draw is the Formula Rossa roller coaster, which the park claims will be the fastest in the world, with carts inspired by F1 race cars reaching grand prix-worthy speeds of 149 miles per hour. A flume-type water ride, meanwhile, passes through a supersize Ferrari 599 V12 engine.

2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,"When Charles Lindbergh took off from Long Island's Roosevelt Field on May 20, 1927, en route to Paris aboard the Spirit of St. Louis, his wardrobe was a study in packing light: Army-issue breeches and ankle boots, an Abercrombie and Fitch flight jacket designed by Benjamin Willis (later of Willis and Geiger Outfitters fame), a brown A. G. Spalding & Brothers jumpsuit to keep out the cold, a wool-lined leather helmet, goggles, a white shirt and -- in a nod to his home base and to the monoplane that would, 3,610 miles and some 33 hours later, make him the most famous man in the world -- a blue-and-red striped tie from Vandervoort's department store in St. Louis. The accessories were minimal, too: a pair of quart canteens, cotton wadding in his ears and a St. Christopher medal, handed to him at takeoff by a well-wisher named Katie Butler. The day after Lindbergh landed at Le Bourget airfield, he stepped out onto a balcony of the American Embassy and greeted a throng of euphoric Parisians in a hastily borrowed double-breasted suit. He'd flown with little more than the flying togs that, captured in untold miles of newsreel footage, became the indelible sartorial image associated with Lindbergh, a man Will Rogers described as a ''slim, tall, bashful, smiling American boy.'' After the flight, Lindbergh wrote that ''no man before me had commanded such freedom of movement over earth.'' Indeed, ''freedom of movement'' was also a guiding principle in Lindbergh's wardrobe: wearable, masculine, sporty, enduring. In the generations since, countless men have embraced the ruggedness of the classic aviator look for the same irresistible reasons. ''At the end of the day, guys like to dress up [like the] military,'' says Nigel Cabourn, the British outerwear guru whose archive of 4,000 pieces encompasses everything from early R.A.F. uniforms to expedition gear worn on Sir Edmund Hillary's ascent of Mount Everest. ''With aviation, it's a whole look, with hats, gloves, fat belts. And everything was pure -- pure wool, pure cotton, pure silk. That's what they were wearing on those aeroplanes. Nothing synthetic.''"

2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,"Maybe it's because I spent so much of my childhood rampaging through the woods pretending to be one of Robin Hood's outlaws or the last Mohican, but I think of old-fashioned knives (the sort you'd use to survive in the wild rather than slaughter rival drug dealers) as being noble rather than scary. I'm not alone. Anyone who wants to play spot-the-designer at the Milan Furniture Fair should skip the fair itself and head for G. Lorenzi, the lovely old coltellinaio, as the Italians call cutlery shops, on the Via Montenapoleone. You'll find lots of boldface men (and women) drooling over beautifully made handles and blades. The knife is a rare mix of precision and sensuality, two irresistible design qualities. Functionally, it's remorseless. If the blade isn't ground into exactly the right form, it won't cut. The same rigor is required of the handle and sheath, which have to be easy to grip even in extreme conditions. Yet knives can be made from very seductive materials: metal, bone, wood, leather. There is also the romantic symbolism. ''A knife is a tool -- one of the most ancient tools, in fact,'' said the German designer Konstantin Grcic. ''It can kill but also save lives. That's what's so fascinating about it.''"

2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,"Whenever it feels like the sky is falling on men's fashion, it's warming to remember that one of Beau Brummell's London tailors, Meyer & Mortimer, is still dressing the hyper-fastidious. This fun fact is one of hundreds in ''Bespoke: The Men's Style of Savile Row'' (Rizzoli), a new tome as handsome as its subject. Up front, the author James Sherwood clears up any uncertainty fogging the much-abused term: To earn the label bespoke a garment must be measured, cut and sewn by hand; the pattern must also be hand-cut. When the pioneers of custom British tailoring took their first orders in the early 1800s, they were for clothes inspired by the ''honest'' wardrobe of the English country gentleman. In 1929 Hawkes & Co. did the unthinkable by introducing ''immediate wear'' to Savile Row, and by 1948, sales of the firm's off-the-peg suits surpassed those of bespoke. It's a trend that has never been reversed, though not for want of trying. In the '90s, Richard Anderson, Ozwald Boateng and Richard James opened shops, forming what Sherwood tags ''The New Establishment.'' And Edward Sexton, Spencer Hart and Timothy Everest are currently powering a ''Row Renaissance.'' ''Bespoke'' is especially good on the crazy language peculiar to the Row.

He is survived by his wife of 66 years, Nancy Ellzey Carlson, six children, and ten grandchildren who will hold him in their memories. Walter, a Colorado native from one of the Pioneer Families of the State of Colorado, graduated from East High School in Denver, Colorado in 1934, and the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1939 with a Masters Degree in Chemical Engineering. During his years at CU Boulder, he served as the editor-in-chief of the campus Silver and Gold newspaper, where he met his future wife, Nancy Ellzey. He was first employed by the E.I. DuPont de Nemours Company in New Jersey, and then at the Louviers facility in Newark, Delaware. At DuPont he became a recognized expert in large scale computer applications for business uses. He guided DuPont to pioneering use of computers in its corporate business. He published articles in technical journals on computer applications and became well known in computing associations for his vision on the business applications of computing equipment. In 1963, Walter was appointed Director of the Office of Technical Information by the United States Department of Defense Director of Defense Research and Engineering. He successfully completed a project by 1967 in which he developed a fledgling intra-net communications network among both private and public defense research facilities across the country to prevent duplicate defense research. In 1967, he was hired by International Business Machines (IBM) to serve as a Technical Consultant to the Chief Scientist at its corporate headquarters in Armonk, New York. He was then transferred to the Corporate Marketing Department where he worked as a marketing consultant to the Vice President of Marketing. He was later able to transfer his responsibilities to San Jose, California. Beginning in the 1960's, Walter was also active in a number of professional computing trade associations, including the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), International Federation of Information Processors (IFIP) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). In the early 1960's he was a founder of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies (AFIPS). From 1970-72, he was President of ACM, the world's largest educational and scientific computing society. One of Walter's longest lasting projects was the history of computing archives and project in the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. His tireless promotion of this endeavor led to contributions to it by IBM and AFIPS. Walter retired in 1991 and continued to work on projects with ACM, AFIPS, IEEE, and other organizations for many years. Walter dearly loved golf and travel, enjoyed politics, and later in life, became an avid tennis fan. He particularly enjoyed bringing his family together to celebrate family occasions. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that, in Walter's memory, please make a contribution to Hospice of the Valley, 4850 Union Avenue, San Jose, California 95124. They can also be found at www.hospicevalley.org. A Memorial for Walter will be held at the Terraces of Los Gatos, 800 Blossom Hill Road, Los Gatos, California, on December 12, 2010, at 10:00am.

Evan, who is the son of David Yurman, might very well be describing the company's brand-new Classic 1957 Limited Edition watch, a sporty, elegant and, yes, gentlemanly timepiece that was inspired by cars from the '50s and the Thunderbird's instrument panel in particular. ''I drive these kinds of cars a lot, and I'm always staring at the speedometer to see where I'm at,'' he says. For Yurman, the '50s were the golden era of American design, and not just in the automobile industry. ''I tip my hat to it and hope I can only add to this legacy.'' When it comes to cars, however, it's ultimately what's under the hood that gets him revved up: he loves the '57 T-Bird for its beauty more than its brawn. ''It is a cruiser, a cream puff,'' says Yurman, who instead owns a '66 Bel Air and a '69 Ford Mustang. ''I go for the one where some guy in the factory said, 'Let's make this car as fast as we can.'

They are comfortable. They provide optimum and all-important back and arch support. They allow maximum air circulation while still providing protection against dropped knives, pans, spilled boiling liquids. Because of their ugliness, when it's time to throw out one food-encrusted pair and buy another, there is no sentimental attachment.

It often began with a phone call at an odd hour and ended, in the case of Micky Dolenz of the Monkees, three days later at a massage parlor in Phoenix. Robin Williams, whose 1980 film ''Popeye'' was scored by Nilsson, covers his face when recalling a similar spree with the songwriter: ''Did I really? A weed whacker?!'' There's no end of booze and drugs -- and famous friends -- in John Scheinfeld's documentary ''Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin' About Him?),'' which opened Sept. 10 in New York. But the film is more than a catalog of the singer's exploits, the extent of which almost certainly contributed to his early death, in 1994 at age 52. Randy Newman compares him to Schubert. ''John loved him, too'' Yoko Ono says."

Last year, this question prompted a shouting match on The Moment, with readers arguing about the artistic merit of a series of Andy Warhol Polaroids shown at Danziger Projects. Now the artist and filmmaker Julian Schnabel shows us his Polaroids in a new book by Prestel creatively titled ''Julian Schnabel: Polaroids.'' In addition to shots of his Montauk, N.Y., studio, his family and a series of rephotographed late 19th-century images called ''Crazy People,'' Mr. Schnabel pointed his rare 1970s-era Polaroid camera at Lou Reed, Placido Domingo, the Beastie Boys and his pal Mickey Rourke (left).

2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,"Paul Thek (above left) was a practicing Catholic and renegade homosexual, a lover of the photographer Peter Hujar and companion to Susan Sontag (who dedicated ''Against Interpretation'' to Thek), a sculptor and creator of immersive environments so devoted to the ephemeral in art that his major works were lost and his reputation eclipsed within his lifetime. On Oct. 21, the Whitney and the Carnegie Museum of Art will present ''Paul Thek: Diver, A Retrospective'' the first major United States survey of works by this legendary and complex artist, who died of complications from AIDS in 1988 at the age of 54, after a creative life spent shuttling nomadically among points as diverse as Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, the East Village and a remote corner of Fire Island. Included in the lineup are ''Untitled (Buzzard)'' (1968; above right) and the ''meat pieces'' he began exhibiting in 1964 -- uncannily realistic wax depictions of hunks of flesh, dotted with flies and encased in Plexiglas, which were his ''hot'' answer to the art world's prevalent trend of ''cool'' Minimalism, and which anticipated the works of Robert Gober and Damien Hirst by decades. ''We accept our thing-ness intellectually,'' he said of these works, inspired by his 1963 visit with Hujar to the catacombs of Sicily, ''but the emotional acceptance of it can be a joy.''

2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,Day's Best Some of the top performances in Saturday's games:
2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,"Lars von Trier's films are so aggressive toward the audience that he has often seemed determined to make moviegoers hate him, and for much of his career I've been happy to oblige. But his ''Antichrist'' is, like ''Blue Velvet'' or ''The Night of the Hunter,'' one of those primal moviegoing experiences that return you to the wonder and fear that, when you first encounter them, make movies so thrilling and terrifying. In the guise of a horror movie Mr. von Trier has made a wrenching portrait of a marriage devastated by grief. A couple (Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg) lose their son in an accident that can't help but burden them with guilt. Ms. Gainsbourg's character is riven with crippling anxiety and depression, and Mr. Dafoe's, a psychologist, is foolish enough to believe he can cure her. When they retreat to their cabin in the woods, her treatment begins -- and hell bursts forth. But it's a recognizable hell: the chaos of nature, which cares nothing for humanity. Shooting in muted greens and browns that recall the Gothic realism of Albrecht Dürer, the cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle makes the woods as furtive and alive as in the most vivid of fairy tales. Because Ms. Gainsbourg's character identifies being a woman with the anarchy of nature, and because she initiates the carnage in the film's harrowing final half-hour, there have been clumsy attempts to paint the movie as misogynistic. But emotionally the film is on her side. Male nature, epitomized by Mr. Dafoe's certainty that everything must have a rational explanation -- despite the contrary evidence before him -- is just as destructive. (Which is why the reviews treating the movie as a thesis to be judged are pathetically beside the point.) This is the film's tragedy: two people joined in grief but separated by the natures they can't transcend."

2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,"To watch Rita Hayworth in ''Cover Girl'' (1944) or ''Miss Sadie Thompson'' (1953) is to witness a magnetically appealing performer at her sauciest. Both are included in this set of five restored and remastered films. (Three -- ''Miss Sadie Thompson,'' ''Salome'' and ''Tonight and Every Night'' -- are being released on DVD for the first time.) But watching Hayworth in the 1946 ''Gilda'' is akin to standing on what you think is solid ground, only to learn that the earth has opened up beneath your feet. Movie stars generally have sexual charisma, but as Gilda, Hayworth creates such a captivatingly elusive fantasy that what she does can barely be called acting. It's more like witchcraft."

Whitney Robinson, Ann Arbor, Mich.A.I contacted Jennifer Conlin, who wrote ''36 Hours in Istanbul'' (Feb. 7, 2010), which she reported last fall. In an e-mail, she warned that it does get cold, so winter is not an ideal time to enjoy some of her favorite activities, like drinks at a rooftop bar, boat rides on the Bosporus, and walks in the gardens - but she did add that you will encounter smaller crowds.

2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,"The Austrian-born artist Gottfried Helnwein is perhaps better known for his Johnny Cash-like sartorial style (black everything, including the ever-present bandanna) and his neo-Gothic Irish castle (site of the star-crossed union of Marilyn Manson and Dita Von Teese) than he is for his own startling body of work: macabre paintings with photographic resonance played out on a grand scale and often in public settings. Throughout his career, Helnwein has glided easily between watercolor, oil and installation work, but his big subject has always been childhood, and not the happy sort. Opening Sept. 16 at New York's Friedman Benda gallery, ''Gottfried Helnwein: I Was a Child'' is the 62-year-old artist's first major exhibition in New York; it's a curiously overdue showing for an artist who enjoyed a retrospective at San Francisco's Fine Arts Museum in 2004 and who shows regularly in Europe (including at the State Russian Museum). But Helnwein has always flirted more with art rock stardom (quite literally, having done work for the Scorpions and hung out with the Rolling Stones) than with a conventional career path to museum-grade respectability. Some might say the artist's work is much like the artist himself: all flash and image. With titles like ''The Murmur of the Innocents'' (above) and ''God of Sub-Humans,'' these works -- executed with obsessive, old-master-worthy technique -- can be as bludgeoning as, say, a Rammstein riff, but you can't take your eyes off them.

My first was Winston Churchill.'') and Mr. Blair's account in his new autobiography (''You are my 10th prime minister. The first was Winston.''). ''There are three possibilities. The first is I guessed absolutely perfectly...the second is Blair decided to endorse what I imagined as the official line; and the third is that he had one gin and tonic too many and confused the scene in the film with what had actually happened.''--PETER MORGAN"

The owner, Clive Darby, late of the Savile Row outfitter Kilgour, marries the precision of English tailoring with the louche sexiness of Serge Gainsbourg. ''He didn't follow some dictated idea of what a suit should be,'' Darby says. ''He wore it with jeans, with sneakers or with fabulous brogues.'' The whole collection -- reversible waistcoats, wrinkle-resistant jersey jackets that pair well with booze-stained undershirts -- targets global gadabouts who travel light. Jackets from about $1,545.

Aptly named (Bar)barian, the collaboration was inspired by what Andi Kovel and Justin Parker of Esque call the ''noble savage'': objects that were once made from horn, wood and stone are reimagined in glass and leather. Why serve drinks from an ordinary decanter when you could present (Bar)barian's Flagon, a swirling glass vessel that resembles the horn of some mythical beast? Or why not go all out with the Travel Bar (right): two hornlike glasses, a bone-shaped stirrer and a leather studded case in which to lug them? Just don't go hunting for dinner with the OB-J slingshot. Rendered in wood-colored glass with an inelastic leather strap and fragile handle, it's entirely nonfunctional. But that's entirely the point: by allowing utility and convenience to go the way of the woolly mammoth, (Bar)barian has transformed objects from the past into up-to-the-minute pieces of pure decadence.

The team acquires big-name veterans every off-season, even though their overpriced acquisitions usually arrive with inflated reputations, baggage and ''headaches'' (quotes provided by Albert Haynesworth). The team spent this week trying to trade the malcontent savant Haynesworth, but he'll be in uniform on Sunday night, if not in the starting lineup. Meanwhile, the team discovered that new quarterback Donovan McNabb was actually a brittle 34-year old feeling the effects of 357 career sacks. Perhaps they should have read the label. McNabb will play on a sprained ankle this week. His weapons include Clinton Portis, Joey Galloway, Larry Johnson and other players whose extended warranties expired years ago. McNabb is 11-8 against the Cowboys in his career, but the last two losses -- 24-0 in the 2009 in the season finale, 34-14 in the playoffs -- were whoppers."

That's part of what makes Charles Laughton's bucolic film noir ''The Night of the Hunter'' so terrifying. The night has 1,000 eyes, but in the city, at least, you know people are looking at you. Robert Mitchum is a switchblade-carrying, self-styled preacher who rolls out of prison and into a small town in search of a grieving widow to bilk. He has his eye on a doleful-looking Shelley Winters, whose husband (Mitchum's former cellmate) has just been hanged for robbery and murder. Angling for the hidden dough, Mitchum dazzles both Winters and the townsfolk with his fire-and-brimstone crazy talk about a vengeful God, but Winters's young son and daughter (Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce) become the chief target of his unremitting, drawling evil."

2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,"Ever wonder how clothing designers dress their homes? The Council of Fashion Designers of America and Assouline are publishing ''American Fashion Designers At Home.'' Written by Rima Suqi, a contributor to T and The New York Times, the coffee-table book ($65, which benefits the CFDA Foundation) looks at the homes of 115 CFDA members, from heavyweights like Diane von Furstenberg and Kate Spade to relative newcomers like Band of Outsiders' Scott Sternberg. The interiors, which range from luxurious - like Eva Chow's gold-leafed Los Angeles living room or Tory Burch's opulent, surprisingly conservative Manhattan apartment - to industrial-funky, like Rachel Comey's Long Island weekend house, may seem glamorous to those of us on the outside looking in. But as Suqi points out, even fashion designers ''are not immune to the pitfalls of decorating or renovating. They have nightmare contractors, too.''

2010-09-12T00:00:00Z,"It was bound to happen. Inevitable, really. With Madonna and Lady Gaga already honored, the television series ''Glee'' had to get around to another pop star in this sorority, one whose triumphal cheesiness, campy earnestness and combination of lightness (on the surface) and darkness (just a few cat scratches beneath) more perfectly capture this musical comedy's essence. So in the next few weeks, as new episodes come along, so does Britney Spears -- in spirit, like her predecessors, and in the flesh, unlike either of them. Her guest appearance will reportedly be brief. But her video oeuvre will be well represented, as the ''Glee'' club poses and preens in sequences taken from Britney's greatest hits. These exertions (and those for another episode) involved the elaborate choreography for which the show is known, and which the photographer Todd Heisler documented at a studio lot and at two Los Angeles-area high schools over five days in August. ''Glee'' is now a bona fide phenomenon, credited with inspiring a resurgent interest in musical theater among young people and singled out for praise by no less influential critics than the Obamas. The show's appeal is widespread, because so are its characters' fantasies: that when they put their minds, voices and feet to it, they can slough off their awkwardness and shine like the gaudiest stars. -- Frank Bruni"

''Fish Forms: Lamps by Frank Gehry'' at the Jewish Museum was inspired by the glass fish lamp in the museum's collection. The eight lamps shown are engaging objects, but they have a deeper meaning.

This was punctuated by the aforementioned indigo shadow, a blend of Lancôme Color Design shadows in Trendy and Drama - perfect shade names for a former Spice Girl. As if that wasn't enough color, nails were painted with a bubblegum pink from Butter London. Didier Malige slicked models' hair behind their ears (a style also seen at Cynthia Steffe, where Avon's Tippi Shorter was going for ""Virgin Suicides""-meets-Marcia Brady) and added a few crimps around the nape of the neck, held in place with Frederic Fekkai Sheer Hold Hairspray."

In serious need of love, they simultaneously attract and repel, typifying the culture of twisted cuteness endemic to Japanese manga comics. But the real revelation in ""Nobody's Fool,"" the Asia Society's arresting retrospective of the artist's two-decade career, is how much he was influenced by punk bands like the Ramones - and the cover graphics of 1960s rock albums. His own collection of vintage King Crimson, Geoff Muldaur, Norman Greenbaum and Carole King albums anchor the museum-wide show, where his pyromaniac girls and orphaned dogs appear in lonely wooden shacks.

2010-09-13T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (TCM) TCM REMEMBERS PATRICIA NEALShe was born Patsy Lou Neal in 1926 in a Kentucky coal-mining town and at the age of 10 wrote a letter to Santa Claus that said, ''What I want for Christmas is to study dramatics.'' By 21 she had won a Tony for her Broadway debut in the Lillian Hellman play ''Another Part of the Forest.'' At 39, a year after capturing the best actress Oscar for her performance as a shopworn housekeeper who resists Paul Newman's charm in the 1963 movie ''Hud,'' she had a series of strokes that put her into a coma for three weeks and left her semiparalyzed and unable to speak. Her husband, the British writer Roald Dahl, oversaw her recovery, and she returned to the screen in 1968, earning her second Academy Award nomination as the bitter mother in ''The Subject Was Roses,'' adapted by Ulu Grosbard from Frank Gilroy's play. That film is one of five that pay tribute to Neal, who died at 84 on Aug. 8. The evening begins with ''Private Screenings: Patricia Neal'' (2004), in which she discusses her career with Robert Osborne, and continues at 9 with ''The Fountainhead'' (1949), King Vidor's adaptation of the Ayn Rand novel, with Gary Cooper as an idealistic architect who refuses to compromise his vision and Neal (above with Cooper) as the woman he loves. At 1 a.m. Neal appears in ''A Face in the Crowd'' (1957) as a television executive who turns a folk-singing drifter (Andy Griffith) into a media darling. The salute ends with ''In Harm's Way'' (1965), at 3:15, with Neal as a Navy lieutenant alongside John Wayne's aging captain, who is assigned to a desk job after a botched mission against the Japanese. 8 P.M. (CW) 90210 A major earthquake rattles Beverly Hills in the Season 3 premiere, which picks up as Naomi (AnnaLynne McCord) deals with the aftermath of her rape.

In response to the Nazi regime, his parents sent him to England at the age of 16. At 18 he was chosen to join the elite group of British Commandos, known as, X-troop. He landed with the allied armies on D-day and fought through out the European campaign. He rose to the rank of captain and was among the troops who liberated his home town. After the armistice was signed, he and a driver drove to Czechoslovakia and were the first Allied soldiers to arrive at the Terezenstadt concentration camp where he found his parents alive. He then organized their return to Holland. Through much of the war he corresponded with his childhood sweet heart, the late Anita Lamm, whose family left Germany for New York City in 1938. They were married in New York in 1948. Manfred recorded this in his memoirs, Life Gave Me a Chance, published in 2009. After the war, Manfred studied Chemical Engineering at the University of Manchester and then went on to MIT where he completed a master's of science. He joined the chemical engineering firm, Scientific Design specializing in design and start ups. His career took him all over the world and was part of the first wave of professionals to conduct business in China and East Germany in 1973. In 1976 he started consulting for the UN and went on many assignments that included Cuba, Turkey, Vietnam, and Pakistan. During his professional career, he was awarded patents and authored technical papers. He was a Fellow of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and was the winner of the 1993 ""Chemical Engineering Practice Award."" He has been an inspiration and will be sadly missed by his brother, Gershon Kaddar in Israel, his son, Daniel Gans, his daughter Aviva Gans Rosenberg, their spouses Linda and David, his grandsons: Aaron, Jeremy, and Dylan, his sister-in-law Lilo Goldenberg Thurnauer, his close friend, Esther Okin, and an extended family and friends throughout the world.

Tamar Cohen-Tzedek opened Cucina Tamar (HaTsfira 10; 011-972-3-639-0407; entrees about $17 to $26) two years ago, and it's now one of the top Italian spots in town. ''When I decided to open a restaurant, I didn't think, Oh, I'm doing this in a man's world,'' she says. ''I just did it.'' So did Einav Berman, who turns out plates like tomato tarte Tatin at her new restaurant, Asif (Lilienblum 18; 011-972-3-516-5198; entrees $16 to $31). At her home kitchen in the Florentin quarter, the American transplant Rima Olvera (above) cooks up a dinner feast for 14 guests every month ($125). And at Joz ve Loz (Yehuda HaLevi 51; 011-972-3-560-6385; entrees $10 to $22), Niva Eshed heads a team of four women chefs (plus one guy) who serve Mediterranean fare like chicken liver ravioli with horseradish sour cream. Unlike in male-dominated kitchens, she says, ''there is no ego. More than for the food, we cook for the experience.''"

The show, which opens Wednesday and runs through March 14, 2011, explores the 20th-century evolution of this pivotal room and its ongoing redesign as a barometer of a changing society. Drawn entirely from MoMA's own collections, ""Counter Space"" comprises more than 300 works, including design objects, architectural plans, posters, photographs, archival films (including one that shows the motion-study pioneers Frank B. and Lillian M. Gilbreth, of ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" fame, and nine of their children), prints, painting and media works. Included are an image of a 1931 kitchen, designed by Lilly Reich, that looks as if it had been completed yesterday, and a tape of the famous 1959 kitchen debate between Richard Nixon and Nikita Krushchev. The exhibition also explores the role of the kitchen in feminist critiques and art movements like Surrealism, Pop Art and Fluxus."

2010-09-14T09:00:06Z,"In 1927, Mies van der Rohe designed the innovative concrete-and-steel Weissenhof apartments in Stuttgart, Germany, which would become a landmark of International-style architecture; that same year, Gerrit Rietveld built the so-called chauffeur's house (above), a little-known but remarkably similar building in his hometown of Utrecht, the Netherlands, which leaked and had to be redone shortly thereafter. Trained as a cabinetmaker, Rietveld - an early member of the de Stijl movement known for his Red-Blue Chair and Schröder House - suffered many such disappointments in a career of more than 45 years. But a new retrospective at Utrecht's Centraal Museum illustrates how his groundbreaking ideas had a much broader impact than is generally acknowledged. ''In Holland you have this feeling that maybe he was a genius but he wasn't a good architect,'' says Ida van Zijl, the curator of ''Rietveld's Universe,'' which opens Oct. 20 as part of the Netherlands' Rietveld Year. ''People don't realize how many works he made and how experimental they were.'' The exhibition puts his furniture and architecture on an international scale, comparing it with Marcel Breuer, Le Corbusier and van der Rohe as well as showing its influence on contemporary designers. In a room dedicated to the Red-Blue Chair, the real thing will sit alongside a video of Maarten Baas's charred homage."

The New York Choral Society, conducted by John Daly Goodwin, opened the program with Harry Belafonte's cheery ''Turn the World Around.'' Next came Bernstein's ''Chichester Psalms,'' an optimistic work he called ''the most B-flat majorish tonal piece I've ever written.''

A dedicated philanthropist and humanitarian, Eric generously supported Jewish community and educational institutions in the United States, in Germany and in Israel, a commitment for which he was recognized with an honorary doctoral degree from BGU this past June. Eric's passionate commitment to philanthropy was made in appreciation for the life and success he had after fleeing Nazi Germany at the age of 19, and was a living memorial to his parents and those who perished in the Holocaust.

Although some of the primaries were nominally competitive - like the Republican Senate race in Maryland, where a suite of 11 candidates will be on the ballot - they were typically not so in places where the nominee stood a strong chance of winning the general election. Two races, however, have changed that equation. And depending on how they are resolved, Republican chances of taking over the Senate could be enhanced or significantly diminished."

The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the passing of Helen Asher of Chicago, a visionary leader in Jewish philanthropy and a stalwart supporter of the Technion. Mrs. Asher's devotion to the ATS and the Technion provided the inspiration and means for dramatic scientific achievement, helping Israel become one of the few countries to launch a student-designed and built satellite. The transformational gift she made with her late husband, Norman, established the Norman and Helen Asher Space Research Institute (ASRI) in 1986, and effectively served to bring the Technion and Israel into the Space Age. Subsequent gifts by the Ashers were instrumental for building the ASRI Building, and for sustaining the world-renowned interdisciplinary research of Technion astrophysicists, aerospace engineers and other scientists. Committed to the Technion for more than 45 years, Mrs. Asher was a member of the Chicago Chapter, a member of the ATS national Board of Directors, a life trustee of the ATS Board of Regents, and an honorary life member of the Technion International Board of Governors. She was awarded an honorary fellowship and doctorate from the Technion, and the Albert Einstein Award from the ATS, its highest honor.

The traditionally Portuguese district of Victorian row houses north of Notting Hill is home to buzzy gastropubs and incognito celebrities - Sophie Dahl and Jade Jagger live here - and the rents are still cheap enough that pioneering shop owners are hanging out shingles on Chamberlayne Road. Victoria Brotherson, the florist behind Scarlet and Violet (76 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-208-969-9446), sells vintage cut-crystal vases and chipped enamel pitchers alongside English blooms like cornflower and nigella. ''I thought I was just going to have a little workshop,'' she says. ''I was taken by surprise that we were that busy.'' In her wake, two vintage furniture stores, Howie & Belle (52 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-208-964-4553) and Circus Antiques (60 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-208-968-8244), have opened among the bookies' offices down the street. And a 10-minute walk away in Kensal Green, Retrouvius (2A Ravensworth Road; 011-44-208-960-6060)is the brainchild of the designers Adam Hills and Maria Speake, a space stocked with repurposed architectural salvage. There's quirky drinking and dining, too: besides the Chamberlayne Pub and Steakhouse (83 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-208-960-4311) and the wine bar Miro's (75 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-203-235-0003), the gastropub Paradise by Way of Kensal Green (19 Kilburn Lane; 011-44-208-969-0098) serves seasonal and organic dishes and a beloved sticky toffee pudding.

2010-09-15T00:00:00Z,Should New York City charter schools be required to have parent associations like regular public schools? From that basic question comes the first charter school controversy of the new school year. Those who back mandatory parent associations for charters see the issue as a matter of principle and of parents' rights. Those who oppose them do so either on technical grounds - that the New York City schools chancellor does not have authority over charter schools that he did not authorize (about 40 percent of the city's charters were authorized by the State University of New York) or on theoretical grounds: that the whole point of charter schools is that they should be free of such mandates.

When a thunderstorm stopped the game for 33 minutes in the second half, the Orlando Sentinel columnist Mike Bianchi, who had needled Tebow on Twitter all afternoon, noted: ''Game is temporarily delayed for lightning.

2010-09-15T00:00:00Z,"Credit Suisse agreed Tuesday to buy a minority stake in the hedge fund York Capital Management for $425 million. The bank, Switzerland's second largest after UBS, will acquire a one-third stake in York, which manages about $14 billion in assets, according to people with direct knowledge of the deal who were not authorized to speak publicly. The move comes as Wall Street firms wrestle with new federal laws aimed at preventing banks from making risky bets with their own money. The new regulations, including the so-called Volcker Rule, limit how much money banks can place in riskier investments like private equity and hedge funds. By structuring the deal as a noncontrol, minority stake in York, whose management team will continue to operate the business independently, Credit Suisse will comply with the new legislation. The investment ''is consistent with the recently enacted U.S. financial reforms,'' the bank said in a statement. Credit Suisse also said that it would not invest its own money into York's funds, though it would market the funds to its clients. Credit Suisse's asset-management group, led by Rob Shafir, has done a number deals in which it has taken stakes in outside investment firms. The bank has a majority interest in Hedging-Griffo, a large Brazilian asset-management firm. It also owns a stake in Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity firm that invests in infrastructure deals. United States banks have taken different approaches to their investments in hedge funds and private equity firms. Morgan Stanley is considering spinning off a hedge fund, FrontPoint Partners, that it acquired in 2006. It also holds minority stakes in Avenue Capital, Lansdowne Partners and Traxis Partners. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman declined to comment. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said at an industry conference on Tuesday that the banking company planned to keep Highbridge Capital Management, a hedge fund with $21 billion in assets under management, as well as One Equity Partners, a private equity unit that manages about $8 billion in assets. And Goldman Sachs sponsors an investment vehicle, Petershill Fund, that takes minority stakes in hedge funds. York was founded with just $5 million in equity capital in 1991 by Jamie Dinan, a former investment banker who is sometimes confused with Mr. Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. York helped pioneer a strategy called ''event-driven investing,'' which grew out of the arbitrage funds of the late 1980s that placed big bets on mergers. York's investments include wagers on the outcome of deals as well as stakes in distressed investments. The firm has performed well during most of its existence, though like many rivals, it suffered during the financial crisis. It reported a 26.4 percent loss in its flagship Multi-Strategy Fund in 2008, according to a letter to investors. It bounced back the next year, reporting a 39.7 percent gain in 2009, according to Hedge Fund Research. York's success has made its founder very wealthy. In 2004, Mr. Dinan paid $21 million for a Fifth Avenue apartment sold by L. Dennis Kozlowski, the fallen former chief executive of Tyco International. Mr. Dinan also owns a horse farm in North Salem, N.Y., about 60 miles northeast of New York City. Under the terms of the Credit Suisse deal, York could receive additional ''earn-out'' payments based on its five-year financial performance. Mr. Dinan and several other principals of the firm also signed retention agreements with Credit Suisse. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
2010-09-15T00:00:00Z,"For 16 years, Marshall A. Cohen served as a director of the American International Group, stepping down just months before the company's near-collapse in 2008. Several months later, Mr. Cohen was again in demand, joining the board of Gleacher & Company, a New York investment bank. Gleacher expanded its board last year to include not only Mr. Cohen but Henry S. Bienen, who served as a director of Bear Stearns from 2004 until its rescue by JPMorgan Chase in March 2008. On the second anniversary of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, appointments like those of Mr. Cohen and Mr. Bienen highlight how the directors of the companies at the center of the financial crisis - A.I.G., Bear Stearns and Lehman itself - still play an active role in the governance of corporate America. ''In too many cases, the radioactivity of a board member of a collapsed company has a half life measured in milliseconds,'' said John Gillespie, a longtime Wall Street investment banker and the co-author of ''Money for Nothing'' (Free Press), a recent book on corporate boards. While in some cases investors are suing members of the boards of the failed companies, shareholder advocates have for the most part focused their energies on other issues. And public outrage over the financial crisis has been mainly focused on the executives in charge of firms like Bear and Lehman. Some, like James E. Cayne of Bear, have not re-emerged at other companies. Richard S. Fuld Jr. of Lehman, which filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008, is running a small advisory firm. Yet the decisions that led to the collapse of the firms they steered were not theirs alone. Directors are elected by shareholders to oversee the activities of a company and play an important role in appointing senior officers and setting corporate strategy. In many cases during the real estate bubble, directors approved the strategy that paved the way for executives to make risky investments on borrowed money. These directors also approved pay packages that fed the risk-taking. ''The C.E.O.'s get most of the attention because there's so little expectation that the board should have done something,'' Mr. Gillespie said. ''In our corporate system the directors are supposed to be in charge, not the C.E.O., yet they rarely get any of the blame because they're typically dominated by the C.E.O.'' A Gleacher spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Cohen, a Toronto lawyer and businessman, did not return a telephone call and e-mail seeking comment. Mr. Bienen, president emeritus of Northwestern University, did not return a telephone call and e-mail seeking comment. Sam Greenwood/Getty ImagesMarsha J. Evans, a former director of Lehman Brothers who continues to serve on other corporate boards. Jay Mallin/Bloomberg NewsCharles Rossotti, a former board member of Merrill Lynch who became a director of Bank of America. Many directors of failed financial institutions have kept the other director posts they had before the financial crisis. Marsha J. Evans, a former Lehman director, has not landed any new board seats, but continues to serve as a director of Weight Watchers, Huntsman and Office Depot, positions that earned her about $500,000 in compensation in 2009. Ms. Evans declined to comment. Some directors were named to the boards of the companies that acquired their ailing firms. Bank of America named two longtime Merrill Lynch directors, Charles O. Rossotti and Virgis W. Colbert, to its board after acquiring the ailing investment bank for $29 billion. Mr. Rossotti and Mr. Virgis did not respond to requests for comment. Merrill's former chief executive, E. Stanley O'Neal, resigned from the firm in 2007 after billions of dollars of mortgage-securities losses, but he was soon snapped up as a board member by Alcoa. An Alcoa spokesman declined to comment. Mr. O'Neal did not respond to requests for comment. Some board members, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, say their experience on the boards of troubled companies, made them stronger directors, giving them hands-on experience that will help them stop other companies from repeating the same mistakes. ''Directors of these financial institutions may or may not have been asleep at the switch, and if they were, they had a lot of company,'' said Michael Klausner, a corporate law professor at Stanford. ''Leaving that question aside, they may well have gained valuable experience that will make them good directors today.'' Two months after Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia in a government-forced transaction, a former Wachovia director, Robert A. Ingram, was named to the board of the semiconductor company Cree. Mr. Ingram, the former chairman of OSI Pharmaceuticals, had served as a Wachovia board member since 2001. Cree will pay Mr. Ingram $303,000 in compensation for 2010, a filing shows. A spokeswoman for Cree declined to comment but cited a December 2008 press release on Mr. Ingram's appointment citing his ''wealth of experience.'' In 2008, the Outstanding Directors Exchange, a unit of the media company Pearson, named Stephen E. Frank an ''outstanding director'' for ''the masterful chairmanship of Washington Mutual's audit committee during a period of intense change.'' Mr. Frank, a longtime utility industry executive, had served on the board of Washington Mutual for more than a decade when the savings and loan - buffeted by excessive exposure to subprime loans - was seized by the government in September 2008 and sold off to JPMorgan Chase. Last year, the Las Vegas utility NV Energy elected Mr. Frank to its board and he earned $109,000 in compensation. A spokesman for NV Energy declined to comment. Mr. Frank could not be reached. In a 2008 interview with Agenda, a corporate-governance newsletter, referring to his experience at Washington Mutual, he said that ''to suggest, with 20/20 hindsight, that an audit committee or a finance committee could easily have prevented these things, I think, is naïve.'' Rakesh Khurana, a Harvard Business School professor specializing in corporate-governance issues, says there are legitimate questions surrounding these boards. ''When selecting individuals to oversee an organization, what criteria should we be using other than their previous performance on a corporate board?'' he said. ''If there's no accountability here, then what is the system of accountability?'' Inquiries into the 2008 financial crisis have spent relatively little time looking at the role of corporate boards. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held four hearings on the causes of the financial crisis, none of which focused on the role of directors. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, appointed by Congress, has held myriad hearings and interviews with executives of failed institutions. Although the public sessions have not included testimony from any outside directors, the hearings did touch on corporate governance, and the commission has privately interviewed directors, according to Phil Angelides, the commission's chairman. ''I don't think there's any question that a dramatic failure of corporate governance was a central issue of the crisis,'' Mr. Angelides said. ''You're going to find when our report is released that this will be a major point.''

2010-09-16T00:00:00Z,"''In fashion, we don't often know the prices,'' said Olivier Theyskens, the designer who has taken a fashion sabbatical since leaving Nina Ricci in Paris last March. ''We don't have time to go into the stores.'' The price of luxury fashion has been out of line with reality for some time, and only since the recession have designers bothered to address that fact. Mr. Theyskens, while re-evaluating his place in this world, decided to try something different and designed a collection for Theory, the captain of contemporary fashion, for spring. The prices are a bit higher than those of Theory, but much less than Mr. Theyskens's work for Ricci, and for Rochas before that. Mr. Theyskens said he had moved to New York to develop the collection after meeting Andrew Rosen, the chief executive of Theory. ''Andrew is very quick reacting,'' he said. The clothes, under the label Theyskens' Theory, are remarkable because they reflect Mr. Theyskens's signature drainpipe style, but also look like Theory's urban wardrobe. Mr. Rosen said he was surprised when Mr. Theyskens made suit separates using stretch wool, the fabric of first-time-jobs that has been a Theory hallmark for years. Of course, his look much different. The jackets, for example, are cut with a deep notch in the back of the neck, so you can pull them down over the shoulders for a slouchy look, Mr. Theyskens said, ''or if you have long hair like me, you can tuck it in the back.'' The first outfit he showed was a narrow-sleeved leather jacket with a white cotton lining, over trim white jeans that had loose-fitting pockets and rolled cuffs that were sewn to stay rolled. They'll cost about $240. The jacket is under $1,000. Several of his floaty dresses, made of double layers of Japanese crinkle polyester, cost $690. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2010-09-16T00:00:00Z,"Wayne Lee took her spring collection in a markedly different - and exciting - new direction that looked like the work of a designer who is finding her voice. Her label, Wayne, seems to have all the answers for what girls want, like her streamlined camouflage cargo pants for fall. But for spring, Ms. Lee is not only listening to her customers, but she is also listening to herself. The collection was mostly made up of layers upon layers of thin tanks, translucent button-down shirts, skimmy dresses and rompers that were folded over at the waist. Those pieces were like the petals of a flower coming together ''with a futuristic and gothic twist,'' Ms. Lee said. The colors were primarily a grainy tan and black, a combination that worked to great effect in a tan blouse with cargo pockets on the chest worn with a black leather corset and leather shorts. The flowers Ms. Lee had in mind were nothing like the garden variety shown by Carolina Herrera earlier in the day, but something more sinister - carnivorous plants."
2010-09-16T00:00:00Z,"A headline on July 22 with an article about a family that inherited a 43-room house in the Hudson Valley overstated the problem that the house presented to its heirs. As the article correctly noted, maintaining a house of that size and age is a struggle; it is not the case that the family lacks ''money to maintain any of it.'' (A family member who does not live full time in the house pointed out that a fund exists for ongoing restoration, but other family members say that fund does not pay for all the operating expenses.) Also, an accompanying picture caption misidentified one of the furnishings shown in the historic home. It is a painted panel, not a fire screen."

2010-09-16T00:00:00Z,"On Friday, Apple announced that it would change the terms of the company's free-case giveaway for the iPhone 4. The following was added to one of the iPhone pages on Apple's Web site:We now know that the iPhone 4 antenna attenuation issue is even smaller than we originally thought. A small percentage of iPhone 4 users need a case, and we want to continue providing them a Bumper case for free. For everyone else, we are discontinuing the free case program on all iPhone 4s sold after September 30, 2010. We are also returning to our normal returns policy for all iPhone 4s sold after September 30. Users experiencing antenna issues should call AppleCare to request a free Bumper case.The quick take on this might be ''Apple to Discontinue iPhone 4 Case Program,'' but that is not quite what is happening here. The more accurate summation is ''Apple to Make You Jump Through a New Hoop to Get an iPhone 4 Case.'' Note the careful language in sentences two and three. Apple is not saying you can't have a free iPhone case anymore - it is saying that the company won't be distributing them as a matter of course. Furthermore, the iPhone app that people have been using to order their free case will no longer be available after Sept. 30. If you buy an iPhone after that date and feel that you're losing your signal, you can still call AppleCare and explain your situation. Those who are having signal dropouts can still get a free case from the company."

2010-09-16T00:00:00Z,"HUDSON--William Hoffman, a resident of Dallas, Texas died in Dallas on Sunday, September 5th, 2010, age 80 of complications of prostate cancer. His passions were quail hunting and his love for the game of polo. Mr. Hudson was born in Oklahoma City on October 24, 1929 into a family with deep American roots. The family of his paternal grandmother founded Hartford Colony. His maternal grandmother's family, the Elder John Strong, arrived in America in 1630 on the ""Mary and John."" His grandfather was Major General Roy Hoffman, an aide to General Pershing in the First World War. General Hoffman received the Legion of Honor from Marshall Foch, the highest honor given to a soldier who is not in the French army. His father, Hubert R. Hudson, had owned the Oklahoma Ada & Atoka Railroad; a friend of Mr. Hudson's, Steven Bechtel saved the railroad from bankruptcy when his construction company rebuilt the two major railroad bridges that had been wiped out by the ravages from flooding. Subsequently, Mr. Hudson sold the railroad prior to the crash of 1929 to the Ingersoll brothers of Philadelphia. William Hudson attended Culver Military Academy in Indiana and Williams College, Massachusetts. His freshman year, he arrived at college with four feisty and agile polo ponies, which necessitated finding like-minded students who also wanted to have a polo team. Mr. Hudson's ponies were not his; he had played polo at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where his family had summered for two years. There he was taught to play polo by Lawrence Phipps, of Littleton, Colorado, who gave him four of his ponies to have for his years at Williams. Upon graduating from Williams (where he only started studying in his fourth year when he discovered ""with surprise, how much his professors had to teach him""), Mr. Hudson decided to enlist in the army because of the Korean War. He was sent to the camp at De Ridder, Louisiana along with thousands of soldiers in preparation for going to Korea. Because he ranked first in the camps evaluation test, he was sent to OCS (Officers Candidate School). After returning from Korea with the rank of Captain, he resumed his interest in polo, spending the next ten years playing polo in America and Europe; in Italy, with Harry Cushing who was captain of the American team and then onto Madrid, Spain where he became close friends with Perico Domecq, and in Deauville, France with Baron Elie de Rothschild, whose team featured the three famous Gracida brothers from Mexico. As each spring turned to summer, Mr. Hudson would move on to England, where the captain of the American team, George Sherman, and his friend Allan Corey, a ten goal player from Westbury, LI invited him to join their team. In England the matches were with Prince Philip, who was captain of the British team. On his return to the United States, in Dallas Mr. Hudson founded the Lone Oak Polo Club, which hosted the first high goal polo tournaments in Dallas where Mr. Hudson was a driving force in Dallas polo; he knew only one speed, and that was faster. Bill Hudson was a veteran of the oil and gas business for over 50 years. He began his career at Tri-State Natural Gas Company, eventually becoming president, where he developed a significant portion of the San Juan field in New Mexico. His wildcatting spirit led to the discovery of the Rocanville field in Saskatchewan. He was also chairman of the American Stock Exchange - listed GNC Energy Corporation and president of TJ Service Company, a contract drilling company with a fleet of 27 rigs. He was Director of the Colorado Rocky Mountain School, Director and President of the Dallas Opera, and member of the Brook Hollow Golf Club, the New York Racquet and Tennis Club, and Doubles. An enthusiastic and avid tennis player where he excelled. Despite his difficult last year, Mr. Hudson exhibited grace, dignity and his inimitable sense of humor while comforted by his family and friends. Mr. Hudson was predeceased by his parents Dorothy and Hubert R. Hudson and his brother Hubert R. Hudson, Jr. He is survived by his beloved wife Cathy, his children Andrew Hudson, Chris Hudson, Eugenia King and her husband Frank Paul, Courtney Nyhuis, his step children Callie Kincaid, Maggie Kincaid, and Sam Kincaid, Lindsay Ganz and her husband Jason. He is also survived by his former wife, Betty Hudson, his sister in NYC Caroline Hudson Firestone, and five grandchildren. A memorial service was held in Dallas, Texas, and a private memorial service will be held in New York City in October."
2010-09-16T00:00:00Z,"An article on Aug. 10 about spinal fluid tests in Alzheimer's research left the incorrect impression that the test can predict the disease with 100 percent accuracy in all patients. (That impression was reinforced by the headline.) In fact, the test was found to be as much as 100 percent accurate in identifying a signature level of abnormal proteins in patients with memory loss who went on to develop Alzheimer's -- not in identifying patients who ''are on their way'' to developing the disease. The article also misinterpreted an element of the researchers' findings. Among a group of patients who had memory loss and developed Alzheimer's within five years, every one had protein levels associated with the disease five years before; it was not the case that ''every one of those patients with the proteins developed Alzheimer's within five years.'' And the article misstated the source from which the finding of 100 percent accuracy was drawn. It came from a separate set of patients that the researchers examined to validate the protein signature they had identified in an initial group. (In the initial group, as the article noted, nearly every person with Alzheimer's had the signature protein levels.)"

By contrast, both Bushes enjoyed early spikes in popularity -- the first after world events like the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the second for his response to the 9/11 attacks. Obama gets good marks from 45 percent of his public -- a testament to his charisma in bad times, according to the historian Douglas Brinkley, a professor at Rice University.''Obama has a high likability factor, like Eisenhower or Reagan,'' Mr. Brinkley said. ''I don't think it's bad that it's 45, but it's a day-glo warning sign. If you get into the 30s it's very hard to get out of that.'' Of more immediate concern to Democrats, Mr. Brinkley noted: ''His charisma isn't transferable to other candidates.''"

2010-09-17T16:59:39Z,"At first glance, this Saturday's schedule seems like a comedown from last week's. No Oklahoma-Florida State, no Ohio State-Miami, no Notre Dame-Michigan. In fact, there is only matchup between ranked teams this Saturday (No. 9 Iowa at No. 24 Arizona). But it would be remiss to think that the lack of marquee games means Saturday holds little intrigue. Several ranked teams will face serious early-season tests, some of them in hostile environments (just ask Texas Coach Mack Brown how much he's looking forward to going into Lubbock to play Texas Tech and its new coach, Tommy Tuberville). Eighth-ranked Nebraska will not only be up against Jake Locker, but it will have to contend with the always intimidating atmosphere in Washington. Florida State returns home after getting blown out at Oklahoma last week, but the Seminoles don't get much of a break when they host Brigham Young. Two A.C.C. teams, Georgia Tech and North Carolina, that have already seen their seasons go in a different direction than they wanted them to, play a game that is already critical for each. And Al Golden, the coach who has turned Temple around and is sure to be mentioned for some high-profile jobs at the end of the season, will see how his Owls fare against Connecticut of the Big East. What this weekend lacks in marquee value, it makes up for in intrigue. And that means that there is plenty of room for error when picking the games. As always, if you agree with the picks, disagree with them or simply find them laughable, feel free to chime in."

At this commemorative moment it is worth pointing out that a number of now-famous actors appeared on the series including Meg Ryan, Julianne Moore, Steven Weber and Marisa Tomei. Amazingly enough, the last three appear together in this scene of love gone brutally, badly and tediously wrong: Not only does this clip egregiously fail to suggest the talent of Julianne Moore in ""Vanya on 42nd Street;'' it fails to telegraph the talent of Steven Weber in ""Wings.''"

The city seemed encased in a wet, almost scary gloom, and inside the cabin, all the windows were fogged up. Everyone worried about visibility. It wasn't just because the boat - one of those wooden 1920s-style commuter yachts from the upmarket Circle Line alternative Classic Harbor Line - was to sail past famous sights: the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge.

""The Jerome girl is a little bit of everything - the rocker, bohemian and a tad flamboyant at times,"" Jerome said via phone while working on her first look book (shot by Eric Ray Davidson) at the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Tex., with Jessica Joffe. If the backdrop and the artful multiculti prints look familiar, it's because the estate belongs to Donald Judd, Jerome's godfather and a collector of ethnic textiles and African masks. ""My prints this season derive from Christmas tree worms and ancient, ritual shoulder clothes from Bhutan,"" Jerome said. You can take the girl out of Marfa."

Hennis, above, a master sergeant who had visited the home days earlier when he answered an ad placed by the Eastburns, was found guilty in 1986 of raping and murdering Ms. Eastburn and killing her daughters. He was sentenced to death. But when defense lawyers argued in 1989 that photographs of the grisly crime scene had been projected on a screen over the defendant's head, an appeals court declared that the case should be retried, and Mr. Hennis was acquitted. DNA later linked Mr. Hennis to Ms. Eastburn's body, and the military took up the case in 2006. In April a military jury found Mr. Hennis guilty and sentenced him once again to death. Elizabeth Vargas reviews the case and interviews Jana Eastburn, the youngest of the daughters, who was left alive inside the house. Ms. Vargas also speaks with Gary Eastburn, Jana's father, and with the lawyer who represented Mr. Hennis in his first two trials. 8 P.M.

Lowell, known as ""Larry,"" graduated from Colgate University, served in the United States Army in World War II as a member of the Red Diamond Rangers and was a general agent for John Hancock for a loyal 25 years. He was a gentleman of greatness; a leader to his comrades, a smart and candid businessman, a man of humble class to his neighbors and a pillar to his family and family of friends. He survived by his daughter Linda L. Camps, his son Christopher L. Camps and son Jeffrey L. Camps; his loving daughters-in-law Judith B. Camps and Loren P. Camps, and dear grandchildren Ashley, Jackson, Brooke and Hunter Camps. Let us learn from his unfiltered kindness and his unbounded gratitude for honesty and hard work. A service of remembrance will be held on Friday, September 17th at 10:30am at the Rye Presbyterian Church in Rye, NY. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in his memory to Alzheimer's Foundation of America, 322 8th Avenue, Seventh Floor, New York, NY, 10001."

2010-09-17T00:00:00Z,"The house of Bill Blass, after sitting out Fashion Week for a few seasons while its new owners retooled the business, introduced a small spring collection Wednesday morning by the designer Jeffrey Monteiro. On a stage in a black tent at Lincoln Center, Mr. Monteiro's models wore a range of cocktail suits, graphically embroidered vests and a selection of red dresses, one of which was made of a loose knit. These were perfectly fine clothes for the day-to-evening crowd, but it is hard to imagine that they will spark a Bill Blass revival. Several talented designers (Peter Som, Michael Vollbracht, Lars Nilsson) have tried to revive Blass in the last decade, and none managed to get a pulse. Mr. Monteiro was probably smart to ignore the past. There was not much connection to Blass in his clothes at all -- no men's wear fabrics, no wild floral prints, no brassy sex appeal. His starting point was a book on Southern African tribes, barely evoked in the beaded trims on his jackets."

2010-09-17T00:00:00Z,"In addition to his signature line, Jason Wu has created a capsule collection for Tse, the knitwear company. He introduced the collaboration last fall with terrific sweaters, but for spring, he wanted to go in a different direction since it's basically the off-season for a sweater company and no one wants to look at heavy knits. At his presentation in the West Village on Tuesday, Mr. Wu showed a couple of paper-thin cashmere T-shirts that were printed to create the illusion of intarsia pastel stripes. Illusion was the theme here. A top that looked as if it was made of a loosely knit yarn was, in fact, made of 50 yards of chiffon. He had painstakingly cut long two-inch-wide strips of white chiffon, sewed them into tubes with the seams fully finished, then put his interns to work knitting them into what looked like a chunky knit sweater and a dress. They weighed nearly nothing."

2010-09-17T00:00:00Z,"At 3:30 p.m., the steps of the Chelsea Art Museum were cluttered with black-clad-clipboard-bearing publicists looking down on an obscene crowd of people who wanted to see the spring Marchesa collection. A car pulled up. The seas parted for Gabourey Sidibe, star of the movie ''Precious.'' A Marchesa-branded S.U.V. pulled up. The seas didn't budge. Who's that? Someone from ''90210.'' Oh. We skipped the line and followed the trail of two women who must have been V.I.P.'s, because their faces appeared to be the handiwork of the esteemed plastic surgeon Dr. Saran Wrap, and were led down a flight of stairs into the bowels of the museum. The space was decked out like a small labyrinth, its walls shielded by gray curtains. At the bottom of the stairs, three models stood like statues, one in a silvery strapless tulle gown, hand-painted to look like ombre. In the next room, a model wore a pearly white gown covered with what appeared to be a spider web of silver crystals around the bodice. In the next, there was a jumpsuit made of expertly draped black lace that loosely skimmed the body and revealed practically the entire anatomy of its model. These were clothes that scream, ''Wow-za.'' Marchesa, the label of the designers Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig, is known for intensely gorgeous dresses and the sense of drama they impart on a red carpet, like that unforgettable wacky, wadded-up tissue mini worn by Heidi Klum back at the Emmys. The spring collection did not disappoint, filled with dresses for people who don't want to hear that tired line from designers who say that a dress should not look like it is wearing the woman. Not a woman on earth has the poise to stand apart from a midnight blue silk tulle dress, hand-painted with flowers, so stiff that its skirt stood out nearly four feet wide. ''This is art,'' Ms. Sidibe said. ''It really is.'' View the full collection."

Like all groups, Muslims run the gamut from saintly to evil, and crude stereotypes are unhelpful and wrong."

2010-09-18T10:38:37Z,"According to a bipartisan chorus - right, center-right, and liberal - the victory of Christine O'Donnell in Delaware's primary proves that the race for the Republican nomination in 2012 is no longer wide open, because Sarah Palin is officially the front-runner. This strikes me as bunkum for many of the reasons that Ramesh Ponnuru and Daniel Larison discuss, and especially for this one: It is extremely unlikely that the political landscape in the winter and spring of 2012 will resemble the political landscape in the autumn of 2010. Even setting aside the unpredictability of economic developments, foreign-policy crises, and everything else that could shift the ground beneath our feet, the reality of having a more empowered Republican Party in Washington and a weaker President Obama in the White House will almost certainly work profound changes on the country's mood - and yes, in the mood of the Republican base as well. (It's hard to be quite so fired up and furious about socialism when Washington is mired in gridlock, and it's hard to be quite so outraged at RINO perfidy when you've kicked a lot of the RINOs out of office.) The temper of conservative politics in the fall of 1994, the off-year election cycle that most resembles this one (it was a year, as Rich Lowry notes, when a former homeless man defeated the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee), bore little resemblance to the temper of conservative politics in 1996, when Bob Dole cruised to the Republican nomination over more base-pleasing candidates like Pat Buchanan and Phil Gramm. And while it's likely that the Tea Parties will lend a greater resilience to the present anti-establishment spirit, 12-t0-18 months of divided government will almost certainly have a dampening effect on the impulses that carried Christine O'Donnell to victory."

2010-09-18T00:00:00Z,"Johnson & Johnson, the American health products company, said Friday that it was in advanced talks to bid for the 82 percent of Crucell, a Dutch biopharmaceutical firm, that it does not already own, in what would be a 1.75 billion euro ($2.3 billion) deal. The all-cash bid would give Crucell stakeholders 24.75 euros a share. Johnson & Johnson would acquire a company known for its research, manufacture and marketing of vaccines and antibodies. It bought its initial stake in Crucell for 300 million euros last year. Crucell shares rose 8.51 euros, or 54.19 percent, to 24.20 euros in Amsterdam on Friday, giving the company a market cap of nearly 2 billion euros. Fabian Smeets, an analyst at Rabo Securities, said he thought the bid might go higher. ''Johnson & Johnson could add a couple euros,'' Mr. Smeets said, citing Crucell's 500 million euros in cash. While other bidders may be in the wings, Crucell is bound by change-of-control clauses for certain products it makes and markets, including Quinvaxem, a vaccine against childhood diseases that it co-developed with Novartis and which is now a major revenue source for the Dutch company. Crucell could lose rights to the drug if it were sold to certain pharmaceutical competitors. Should the deal go through, Johnson & Johnson would maintain Crucell's management, staff levels and headquarters in Leiden, the Netherlands, the company said. The expectation of such a limited restructuring in the event of a takeover is one reason why Crucell prefers Johnson & Johnson, Mr. Smeets said, adding that it would occupy a special place in a company that allows for entrepreneurship, unlike some other drug makers. The last time Crucell was in play was just last year, but the bid from Wyeth fell through after it was taken over by Pfizer. --Chris V.

Not without an infusion of public money, they say, as a way to neutralize the impact of deep-pocketed donors, who have pushed the cost of running for federal office into the tens of millions of dollars in recent election cycles.

(TCM) STARRING MAURICE CHEVALIER This French music-hall performer, born in 1888 and awarded an honorary Oscar in 1959, is given a five-film retrospective, starting with ''Gigi'' (1958). Written by Alan Jay Lerner, with a score by Frederick Loewe, this musical stars Leslie Caron in the title role of a young Parisian woman who hopes to find a husband. Chevalier plays Honoré Lachaille, whose nephew has an up-and-down romance with Gigi. At 10:15 Billy Wilder directs Chevalier in ''Love in the Afternoon'' (1957); he plays a detective hired to follow a wife suspected of a dalliance with an American (Gary Cooper). The detective's daughter (Audrey Hepburn) falls in love with the playboy and tries to save him. In ''Man About Town'' (1947), at 12:30 a.m., Chevalier portrays a film director who competes with Jacques (François Périer) for the affection of Lucette (Dany Robin). This French-language movie is notable for its use of an English voice-over by Chevalier, in lieu of subtitles. At 2:15 a.m. Count Danilo (Chevalier) wants to keep a wealthy widow (Jeanette MacDonald, above left with Chevalier and Minna Gombell), a great source of tax revenue in his country, from marrying a stranger in Paris in ''The Merry Widow'' (1934). And at 4 a.m. Chevalier plays a guitar-strumming priest in Sicily, where an American midwife (Angie Dickinson) causes a ruckus with her sex appeal in ''Jessica'' (1962). 10:30 A.M.

Gatherer of differences, pioneer of peace, physician of the soul. A message of love from your students of All Faiths Seminary. You showed us how to see each other through the eyes of the heart, as brothers and sisters connected in divine, loving unity. How to live life to the fullest, how to face resistance with love, how to always be giving of spirit, how to accept all living beings as part of G-d, how to study scripture and interpret it on our own, how to break down walls of hate, how to build foundations of love, how to always be on a journey inward, how to respect all beliefs and celebrate the miracle of life in concert with them, how to be resilient in the face of despair, how to sing and dance at every chance, how to remember that fear is the greatest sin and the opposite of love, how to be victorious over the negative, how to be forgiving, how to wake up each morning grateful for life, and above all else, how to be joyful always joyful. Yes, Rabbi, We Are Ready for life. We Are Ready to do the good and the beautiful. You must have had faith that we are. Once again, our brother, you have brought us all together.

BEHIND THE NEWS At $10 each, the ads were on track to generate an estimated $44 million this year. (Most other listings on the site are free.) The company is legally shielded from liability for what users post. But prosecutors pressed Craigslist to close the section, saying it facilitated prostitution and other sex crimes. Advocates for free speech questioned the wisdom of the shutdown, arguing that the site had helped the police crack crimes and that the ads were sure to pop up elsewhere."

Many Democrats want to scrap future cuts for the wealthiest taxpayers -- individuals whose income after deductions is more than $200,000 and couples at $250,000 or more. The Republican leaders insist that all taxpayers should get relief, even those in the highest income strata. Wealthy Americans, they say, can use their tax savings to create jobs. In either case, the extensions would be expensive: perhaps $2.7 trillion less for the Treasury through 2020. Here is a guide to who will get what if the cuts are extended, and who got what from the last seven years of cuts, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research organization"

''TV is better, and has been for a few years now. I realized this when faced with the choice of going out to watch a sophomoric Judd Apatow flick or staying home to watch 'The Wire.' In addition to the sophistication of TV shows that Mr. Scott notes, there is another reason that TV appeals more to grown-ups, and that is the depiction of women. It has been years since I have seen a female character in an American movie with the complexity of a Carmela Soprano, the compassion of a Carol Hathaway on 'ER' or the grit and intelligence of a Claudette Wyms on 'The Shield.' If Hollywood movies were your sole guide, you'd think all women were dimwitted, hypersexualized, fashion-obsessed appendages."

We visit places around New York that most people have never heard of: Swinburne Island or the ship graveyard in Coney Island Creek. Some are wild and overgrown, places where herons nest along deserted creeks.

2010-09-19T00:00:00Z,"SUNDELL--Michael Gordon, Professor Emeritus of Humanities at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of the Arts and Sciences and former President of Yaddo, died in his sleep on September 7, 2010. In addition to his wife Nina, he is survived by his sister, Esther Lichti of Lubbock, TX; his children Marianne, of Wendell, Massachusetts, and David and Margaret, both of New York City; as well as his son-in-law Reinaldo Laddaga, and his grandchildren Julia and Lillian Sundell-Thomas and Tomas Laddaga. Sundell was born in New York City on April 1, 1934. The first member of his family to earn a university degree, he received a B.A. from Hamilton College, and an M.A. and Ph.D. in English Literature from Yale University. He met his wife, Nina Castelli Sundell, in Paris while a Fulbright Fellow at the University of Montpelier. A distinguished scholar and administrator in academia and the arts, Sundell taught English literature at Hamilton College, Queens College CUNY, Case Western Reserve, and George Mason University. He served as the Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences of The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Art and Science, and was President of the artist's retreat, Yaddo, in Saratoga Springs, a position he held from 1992 until his retirement in 2000. Sundell oversaw the transfer of Yaddo's archives to the New York Public Library. At George Mason, he supervised the preservation and indexing of the archives of the Federal Theater Project of the WPA, which were on deposit from the Library of Congress. He wrote and lectured about nineteenth-century English literature, twentieth-century American art, the history of photography, and relations among public policy, patronage, and the arts. Mosaics in the Eternal City--his book about late antique and medieval mosaics in Rome and the fruit of research conducted as a Visiting Scholar at the American Academy in Rome --was published in 2007. In lieu of sending flowers, donations may be made in his name to the American Academy in Rome, the Yaddo Garden Association, the New York Public Library, or the New York University Cancer Institute."
2010-09-19T00:00:00Z,An article on March 21 about Taiwan's hot springs referred incorrectly to air service between Taipei and New York. There are indeed direct flights between the two cities; it is not the case that flights require a connection. (Flights on China Airlines and Eva Air from New York to Taipei require a fuel stop; their flights from Taipei to New York are nonstop.) A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail received Sept. 3.

He's 12, and the children seem to think I owe them two used dogs or one new dog. I tell them to look out on the grass that borders our sidewalk - it's as if we already have several pets."

2010-09-19T00:00:00Z,"Most jobs begin with a training session or some sort of ''why don't you familiarize yourself with these documents'' meeting. But no orientation could have covered the sheer breadth of my first assignment as Frugal Traveler: to get from Sao Paulo to New York City on less than $500 a week and blog about it. During the 13-week trip - most memorably through Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Mexico, I slept in hammocks, farmhouses and under-$15 hotel rooms; I ate ants, guinea pigs and every local fruit I could find; and I saw pre-Columbian fortresses, Mayan priests who foretold my future and dolphins when I went searching for alligators on the Brazil-Bolivian border."
