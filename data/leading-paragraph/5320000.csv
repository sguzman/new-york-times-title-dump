1988-10-05T00:00:00Z,"''Debajo del Mundo'' (''Under the World'') exists in dangerous artistic territory. The film is based on a true story, of Polish Jews who in 1942 escaped to a makeshift hovel dug underground in the woods. For the next two years the family of six moved from one squalid catacomb to another. This subject comes so loaded with emotional power that one dishonest scene could send the film careening into cheapened sentiment, manipulation or self-righteousness. But the exceptional achievement of ''Debajo del Mundo'' is to display the ugly truth - these hunted people could not take eating or breathing for granted - with a brutal honesty that is enhanced, not evaded, by gracefully composed visual images. The film defines its role in Holocaust literature modestly and effectively. It is not a philosophical or intellectual examination of evil; it does not take the exhaustive approach of Marcel Ophuls (''The Sorrow and the Pity'' and the forthcoming ''Hotel Terminus''), in which the overwhelming accretion of details is part of the viewer's experience; and it does not try to engage our sympathies easily by singling out one character, an Anne Frank, with whom we are asked to identify. Instead, it focuses on the daily survival of parents and their sons - three young men and an adolescent boy - for whom heroism is stealing potatos under cover of darkness and drama is lighting a fire that could mean discovery. They are nearly found by scavengers who pick up the unbearable smell of excrement that comes from their hiding place."

The director's voice is still full of bravado at the age of 76. With his lined face and flowing white hair, even smoking a cigar he looks like an aged avenging angel swooping down from the screen to rage against war.

So he didn't seem surprised recently when the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit announced that it, too, would be pulling up some stakes.

An ambiguous term, worldliness, nicely poised between vice and virtue. On the one hand it suggests the world, the flesh and the devil; on the other, the broadly desirable qualities of experience and urbanity."

Instead, diners are scanning the menu for something that's unforgettably rich and intense. That may explain why a number of chefs are presenting more elaborate, more voluptuous and even more desserts on the plate.
