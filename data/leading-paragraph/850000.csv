1895-07-07T00:00:00Z,"ALEXANDRIA BAY, July 6. -- One of the attractions of the Thousand Islands is that it affords accommodations for all pocketbooks, all respectable grades of society, and these grades can as exclusively colonize themselves as if they respectively were to spend the season at resorts individually classed or graded."

The trio come from Toulouse, and this fact in Paris makes them more important than if they came from anywhere else."

1895-07-14T00:00:00Z,"POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., July 13. -- Fred Garrison and his stepson, John Stengel, went into their barn here this evening to take care of their horses.

Mr. Bliss Perry, in ""The Plated City,"" has shown marked powers of discernment and has treated a difficult subject with uncommon skill. It is the doubt about Esther Beaulieu, whether or not black blood runs in her veins, which makes her life so pathetic."
1895-07-14T00:00:00Z,"The first of these tales is the story of the boarding house. Jane Blagden is the disagreeable woman. Inquisitive people are invariably snubbed by her, and particularly Mrs. Wyman, a silly widow, gets crushed by the disagreeable woman. Young Dr. Fenwick, who wants for patience, finds in Miss Blagden many desirable traits. The disagreeable woman opens her portemonnaie whenever Dr. Fenwick asks her to help his poor patients."

1895-07-14T00:00:00Z,"The realism of an English street, say, in London, Marsh Street, as it is called, Mr. Edwin W. Pugh describes. It is only natural that we should make comparisons between the same classes in London and New-York, but Mr. Pugh does not tell us the occupation of either the man who tells what he sees or of his companions, Sheckles, Slike, Evers, Straight, or Jack Cotter."
1895-07-14T00:00:00Z,"The reunion of the Phillips family, in progress yesterday at 976 Trumbull Avenue, was unique in that there were assembled five generations.

The heroine is a daughter of Bohemia, who has been compelled to work for a living, and has been a sad flirt. Her hero is a priggish dramatist and novelist, who cherishes a high ideal of womanhood. He is also something of knave, and an impossible fool, to boot."

The waking will be slow and not unaccompanied by pain, however, unless there is a fall of temperature. This is roof-garden weather, decidedly, and the open-air shows are getting the benefit of it."

They are Fitzherbert, quarter-mile; Horan, half and three miles; and Mendelsohn, long jump. W.E. Lutyens came down from Yale Thursday, so that the English contingent now at the Oval is a very respectable and vigorous looking lot of athletes."
1895-09-14T00:00:00Z,"Your editorial, ""Victory -- A Yellow Dog,"" sets forth, with the vim, snap, and point characteristic of The Times, the yachting status quo. That pesky excursion fleet seems to have caused this undesirable snarl. Although its antics had been foreseen to the fullest extent, no comprehensive provisions for their restraint had, so far as appears, been made."

1895-09-14T00:00:00Z,"NEWBURG, N.Y., Sept. 13. -- Clarence Lexow will be renominated for another term. There is opposition to him in this district, comprising the Counties of Rockland and Orange, which is strong in some sections. His record last Winter in the Senate on the New-York Reform bills, when he deliberately tumbled off the high perch which free advertising in the New-York City police investigation had given him, has disgusted many Republicans in the two counties."

It is a well-known fact that, in all our large cities, there is a great body of women who sell themselves, soul and body. It is idle to stop and say that men are responsible for this horror. I have no desire to screen men."
