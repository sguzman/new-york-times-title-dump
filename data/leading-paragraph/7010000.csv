Hy, as he was called by his friends, always had a joke to tell and was a relentless teaser. Fittingly, one of his first jobs was as a radio comedy writer. He wrote for Jackie Gleason, Milton Berle, Fred Allen and Arthur Gottfried to name a few. When he married Beatrice in 1945, he moved into the business world. He was one of the first to lease air conditioners and televisions to hospitals and hotels. That grew into the installations of security systems. He was also a pioneer in the world of cable television which is where he achieved financial success. Additionally, he opened a women's health clinic, TLC Women's Services, in the early 1970s. He was an avid golfer, and he and Bea split their time between Palmas del Mar, Puerto Rico and North Shore Towers, Queens. They were married for 62 years and spent the last five years of their lives in Edgewater, New Jersey. Herman leaves behind his son Brian, daughter Michele, and son-inlaw Dr. Kenneth Glassberg. He was adored by his five grandchildren, Lola, Chloe, Lauren, Larry and Andrew, and Andrew's fiance Mia. They will remember his generosity, his humor and his favorite made-up words and nicknames. Contributions may be made in Herman's name to Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of NYPresbyterian, c/o Emily Taub, Office of Development, 654 West 170th Street, NY, NY 10032.

2007-12-07T17:37:38Z,"The New York Times's report on the C.I.A.'s destruction of two videotapes showing interrogations has taken on a life of its own across the blogosphere, where writers raised new questions, recalled to old ones and cross-referenced each other to create a fascinating, complex stew of opinion and analysis."

A wine bar that's based on the honor system, the Weinerei at Zionskirchplatz (map) has a charming, if naively misplaced, faith in mankind's honesty. For the price of one euro, you ""rent"" yourself a glass and get to sample as many of the wines as you want.

2007-12-07T15:21:56Z,"For the second year in a row, the pool at The Raleigh is proving too inviting to resist. At Jeffrey Deitch's late-night party, there were so many skinny-dipping galleristas that the scene resembled a Spencer Tunick photo Turns out the ripped-from-the-Colosseum Roman soldiers clanking around town are not here for a sword-and-sandals convention but to hype a freshman fair, Roma Contemporary, making its debut in February It seems there's safety in numbers at this year's fair. More and more dealers are sharing spaces, forging ""Survivor""-like alliances to avoid being voted off next year, when the fought-after spots are reassessed by the new regime. Mary Boone and Rafael Jablonka from Cologne have the smartest set-up: a room each to do with as they will and a third make-nice space for Eric Fischl, the one artist the two galleries share Massive steroid-charged artwork is not limited to the main fair. It also gets a workout at Pulse, where there is a courtyard stocked with jacked-up sculptures by Jurgen Mayer, Chris Larson and the tattooist-cum-fine artist Duke Reilly. Reilly's work is a replica of a revolutionary war submarine called the ""Turtle,"" which in truth looks more like an old whisky barrel. The larkish Reilly submerged his work in the Hudson River early this year and ""attacked"" the QM2, an offence which got him arrested (the $120,000 tag for the piece includes a video of his capture) It's not just the wholesale appropriation trend that is trying the patience of gallerists. As the circuit hits 23 fairs and counting, FedEx and other couriers cannot handle the volume of art that's zipping round the world. Galleries will soon have to find alternative methods, with many acknowledging that delivery delays have been worse than ever. Some shipments failed to arrive. For the first day, Berlin's Galerie Michael Schultz had to make do with a minimalist set up of two canvases (the rest of the booth showed up last night); while a Danish gallery canceled completely when they received word that its shipment wouldn't make it in time. That was good news for on person at least: the booth-less Aussie art collective The Glue Society was promoted into the space to exhibit its waggish light boxes, which show satellite images of what appear to be ancient Biblical scenes. Divine intervention?"

''Clown is a totally dirty word -- no one uses clown in their title,'' he said. ''It sets you up to defend that you're not doing children's work.'' But 500 Clown uses that word in its name and in the titles of back-to-back productions coming to Performance Space 122 this month. And these are not children's shows. ''500 Clown Frankenstein'' and ''500 Clown Christmas'' will each offer an unusual and acrobatic take on a classic story. In ''Frankenstein,'' above, the three clowns (Mr. Danzig, far right, with Paul Kalina and Molly Brennan) try to construct Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory, leading to feats both comic and gymnastic, until things take a harsh turn. When one is forced into the role of the creature, the novel's darker themes begin to surface."

The release was the result of declassification requests by researchers at the National Security Archive of George Washington University and elsewhere; it was not because of a regulation requiring review and possible declassification of documents after 25 years.

It is with tremendous sorrow that we announce the passing of esteemed O'Melveny & Myers LLP partner, Howard Bergtraum, at the age of 61 after a difficult battle with cancer. Howard was loved and admired as a partner, mentor, advisor and friend who will be sorely missed. As co-head of our Private Equity Fund practice and member of the Tax and Transactions practice, Howard was a force in the profession and within our Firm. He was recognized by both his peers and various publications as one of the premier attorneys in these fields. In addition to being a brilliant lawyer, Howard was a man of decency, character, and effortless compassion. He was a committed husband, dedicated father, loving brother, and proud uncle. He was a central figure and role model to his family, and generous with his time and unparalleled knowledge. Our heartfelt condolences and sympathy go to Howard's wife Susan, their three children, Jordan, Matthew and Andrea, his sisters Judy and Marcia and his son and daughter-in-law, Jared and Randi.

Mrs. Faulkner's new book, ''Murdered by Mumia: A Life Sentence of Loss, Pain and Injustice'' (the Lyons Press), lays out the case against Mr. Abu-Jamal, known for his death-row writings on racial and social justice.

In ''Impermanent Collection,'' to be performed tonight and next Friday as part of the Whitney Museum of American Art's Whitney Live series, the Moving Theater directors Brennan Gerard and Ryan Kelly use five dancers, the new-music group International Contemporary Ensemble and a series of videos by Brock Labrenz to blur the boundaries between those experiences: permanence and impermanence, art object and live performance, the historical and the contemporary."

This ''novel in words and pictures,'' published by Scholastic last winter, became a children's best seller. Set in Paris in 1931, it centers on the adventures of its title character, a 12-year-old orphan solving a mystery involving his own past and that of the cinema -- specifically the work of the early French filmmaker Georges Méliès. The novel teems with cinematic references, and this weekend Mr. Selznick will visit the Museum of the Moving Image for its ''Magic, Music, and Early Movies,'' a festival including an ''Invention of Hugo Cabret'' celebration."

2007-12-07T00:00:00Z,"Last week, for the first time since Hurricane Katrina overwhelmed the news airwaves two years ago -- and for the first time sinceTed Koppel retired from network television shortly thereafter -- ABC's ''Nightline'' drew more viewers in a week than ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' and ''Late Show With David Letterman,'' according to Nielsen estimates released yesterday by ABC. ''Tonight'' and ''Late Show'' were in repeats last week, casualties of the Hollywood writers' strike, but the ratings for ''Nightline'' were nonetheless a milestone in the post-Koppel era. ''Nightline'' drew an average of 4 million viewers each night last week, about a half million, or 14 percent, more than Mr. Leno (3.5 million) and nearly a million, or 30 percent, more than Mr. Letterman (3.1 million), Nielsen estimated. Figures provided by ABC show that over all, the viewership of ''Nightline'' was up 4 percent over the same week last year, while that of ''Tonight'' was down 43 percent, and that of ''Late Show'' 30 percent. James Goldston, the executive producer of ''Nightline,'' said, ''I guess the test will be whether we can keep it up once the strike ends.'' Even with the strike, the viewership of ''Nightline'' lagged behind that of ''Tonight'' during the recently concluded November sweeps, Nielsen figures from ABC showed. But ''Nightline'' did overtake ''Late Show'' and attract its biggest November audience since 2004."

Instead of showing us what we could be, artists have reflected back to us an imperfect image of who we are and the world in which we live. This shifting attitude has resulted in a variety of artwork that is troubling, ugly and rooted in the baser instincts of human nature, as demonstrated by the Algerian-born artist Adel Abdessemed in his first solo New York exhibition, now at P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center. It is a rough ride consisting of sculpture and video that will test even the most hardened contemporary-art aficionado, and it begins with a video close-up of a cat tearing up and eating a street mouse. This is followed by another video of a man putting a snake in his mouth, though the tape cuts out at this point, and you never see what happens next."

2007-12-07T00:00:00Z,"NEW YORK ANIME FESTIVAL This celebration of Japanese anime culture -- the first of what's planned to be an annual event -- is intended to be even more interactive than most pop culture conventions. The festival, to be held this weekend at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, includes exclusive screenings, autograph signings, video games, live-action Japanese cinema and panel discussions. ''There are a lot of anime events across the country, but New York has a void,'' said John P. McGeary, a show manager with Reed Exhibitions, which organized this festival as well as the New York Comic Con. Appreciation of anime also ''gets so much deeper than what you can do at a comic-based show,'' he said. That deeper interaction includes cosplay -- costume play -- in which fans dress up and act as their favorite characters. Tonight die-hard cosplayers will compete at a masquerade in which registered teams will show off their outfits for a chance to win a photo spread in Anime Insider and a trip to Japan to represent the United States in the World Cosplay Summit Championships. Another chance at fame comes with ''Who Wants to Be a Voice Actor?'' The winner of this three-round open audition (Sunday at 12:30) will receive a paid acting role in a forthcoming production from NYAV Post or TripWire Productions, the two biggest anime dubbing studios in New York."

Michael was born on September 23, 1927 to Leo George Hadley Jr. and Marsulite Nolker Hadley in St. Louis, Missouri. He also resided in Evanston, IL and Greenwich, CT. Michael married Gladys Pauline (Polly) Rolwing on October 16, 1954 at the Annunziata Catholic Church in St Louis, Missouri. He graduated from New Trier High School in Evanston, Illinois and received his undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis. He then went on to work: in the Foreign Service in West Berlin and Moscow, Hadley Dean Glass Company in St. Louis, Curtis Publishing Company in St. Louis, Times Mirror Magazines, Inc. in New York City, The Sporting News in St. Louis, and Veronis Suhler and Associates in New York City. He was also a member of the Magazine Publishers Association and served on the Board of Directors for the Falstaff Brewery in St. Louis. He also served on the Board of Directors for the Animas Foundation in southern New Mexico. When Michael was editor of his grammar school yearbook he won an award for best layout and design. It was an award he treasured all his life. It foreshadowed his success in Publishing. He was also an avid swimmer and was on the Varsity Swim team at New Trier High School. He also enjoyed sailing and body surfing. He is survived by his children Martha Christine (Polly) Ruff, Nancy Stewart Hadley, Sally Catherine Hadley, and Laura Nolker Hadley. His siblings Leo George Hadley III, Ann Schmick Jewett and Mary Schmick. Grandchildren Jeremy David Ruff, Jacob Michael Ruff, Chelsea Christine Ruff, Boyd Easton Bissell Jr. and Hadley Brodhead Bissell. Other survivors include Edward G. Rolwing and John M. Rolwing. He is preceded in death by his wife Gladys Pauline (Polly) who passed away on September 2, 1971, and his brother William Schmick. Michael was more than a father to his four daughters: he was a ''daddy''. He was always ready to shop, get ice cream, go to the beach, and help with homework. The neighborhood was often at the house. He was a mentor, peacemaker and problem solver. He made each day, no matter how hectic or ordinary, extraordinary and fun. Visitation will be on Friday, December 14 at 10:00am at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, 7148 Forsyth Blvd., St. Louis, MO, 63105. Catholic services will follow. Reverend Monsignor Edward J.

Michael was born on September 23, 1927 to Leo George Hadley Jr. and Marsulite Nolker Hadley in St. Louis, Missouri. He also resided in Evanston, IL and Greenwich, CT. Michael married Gladys Pauline (Polly) Rolwing on October 16, 1954 at the Annunziata Catholic Church in St Louis, Missouri. He graduated from New Trier High School in Evanston, Illinois and received his undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis. He then went on to work: in the Foreign Service in West Berlin and Moscow, Hadley Dean Glass Company in St. Louis, Curtis Publishing Company in St. Louis, Times Mirror Magazines, Inc. in New York City, The Sporting News in St. Louis, and Veronis Suhler and Associates in New York City. He was also a member of the Magazine Publishers Association and served on the Board of Directors for the Falstaff Brewery in St. Louis. He also served on the Board of Directors for the Animas Foundation in southern New Mexico. When Michael was editor of his grammar school yearbook he won an award for best layout and design. It was an award he treasured all his life. It foreshadowed his success in Publishing. He was also an avid swimmer and was on the Varsity Swim team at New Trier High School. He also enjoyed sailing and body surfing. He is survived by his children Martha Christine (Polly) Ruff, Nancy Stewart Hadley, Sally Catherine Hadley, and Laura Nolker Hadley. His siblings Leo George Hadley III, Ann Schmick Jewett and Mary Schmick. Grandchildren Jeremy David Ruff, Jacob Michael Ruff, Chelsea Christine Ruff, Boyd Easton Bissell Jr. and Hadley Brodhead Bissell. Other survivors include Edward G. Rolwing and John M. Rolwing.

Michael was more than a father to his four daughters: he was a ''daddy''. He was always ready to shop, get ice cream, go to the beach, and help with homework. The neighborhood was often at the house. He was a mentor, peacemaker and problem solver. He made each day, no matter how hectic or ordinary, extraordinary and fun.

2007-12-09T00:00:00Z,"PIXELATED STAINED GLASS In late August, at the unveiling of the massive, awe-inspiring stained-glass window [37] designed by the artist Gerhard Richter for Cologne Cathedral in Germany, the city's conservative archbishop, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, was notably absent. Though Meisner claimed a prior engagement, skeptics suspected otherwise. Meisner had insisted that only a figurative depiction of 20th-century Catholic martyrs could substitute for the original Gothic window, which was destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II and never suitably replaced. Richter, however, delivered something wholly unexpected: an abstract composition of 11,500 identically sized units -- at 14.5 square inches each, they are frequently compared to pixels -- in 72 colors, the arrangement of which was determined randomly by a computer program. Richter originally produced two drafts for the window, each portraying the Nazi execution of innocents. But he ultimately concluded that ''figurative'' was something he simply could not do. ''I was not able to make something of it,'' he says. Any representational image would have been tiresomely dissected for meanings religious, political, symbolic. There were also more mundane reasons. As the cathedral's master builder, Barbara Schock-Werner, writes in a catalog essay for the window, ''How could such a depiction be realized other than in gloomy, oppressive colors?'' This was not a frivolous matter of interior decoration but a practical concern: the prismatic 1,200-square-foot window would bathe the cathedral (and congregation) in a significant amount of light."
2007-12-09T00:00:00Z,"CULINARY ORIENTALISM ''Tell me what you eat,'' wrote the 19th-century French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, ''and I shall tell you what you are.'' In other words, an understanding of a community's cuisine entails an understanding of the community itself. Of late, the cookbook industry seems to have made -- perhaps unwittingly -- a case that understanding Middle Eastern cuisine is the path to resolving the world's geopolitical crises. Consider Claudia Roden's ''Arabesque,'' a cookbook that takes in the variant cuisines of Turkey, Morocco and Lebanon [13, 14]. In a review in Slate, Michael Lukas, an American living in Turkey, points out that ''Arabesque'' is not just -- is not even primarily -- an excellent cookbook: by socially, politically and historically contextualizing the three cuisines, he argues, Roden has also written an effective primer on the diversity of the Middle East. Lukas even goes so far as to suggest that the late scholar and activist Edward Said (the author of ''Orientalism,'' an influential critique of traditional scholarship about the Middle East) might have recommended Roden's book as a reliable guide to the region."

We believe, as did the founding fathers, that no specific religion should be elevated above all others by the government. The authors of the Constitution knew that requiring specific declarations of religious belief (like Mitt Romney saying he believes Jesus was the son of God) is a step toward imposing that belief on all Americans. That is why they wrote in Article VI that ''no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.''"

2007-12-09T00:00:00Z,"Airborne Wind Turbines Traditional wind turbines can be unreliable sources of energy because, well, the wind blows where it will. Not the case 1,000 feet up. ''At a thousand feet, there is steady wind anywhere in the world,'' says Mac Brown, chief operating officer of Ottawa-based Magenn Power. To take advantage of this constant breeze, Brown has developed a lighter-than-air wind turbine capable of powering a rural village. ''Picture a spinning Goodyear blimp,'' Brown says. Filled with helium, outfitted with electrical generators and tethered to the ground by a conductive copper cable, the 100-foot-wide Magenn Air Rotor System (MARS) [1] will produce 10 kilowatts of energy anywhere on earth. As the turbine spins around a horizontal axis, the generators convert the mechanical energy of the wind into electrical energy, then send it down for immediate use or battery storage."

But in the case of the Honeycomb Vase, it's 40,000 -- because the ''workers'' who made it were bees toiling in their hive. The vase was conceived by Tomás Gabzdil Libertiny, a young Slovakian product designer. Eager to explore the relationship between design and nature, he settled upon beeswax as a suitable material and chose the vase as an appropriate object to make from it. ''Beeswax comes from flowers and, in the form of a vase, it ends up containing flowers before they die,'' Libertiny says. ''It's a beautiful story.''"

But if you tip it over, something unusual happens: it rights itself. It leans off to one side, rocks to and fro as if gathering strength and then, presto, tips itself back into a ''standing'' position as if by magic. It doesn't have a hidden counterweight inside that helps it perform this trick, like an inflatable punching-bag doll that uses ballast to bob upright after you whack it. No, the Gomboc is something new: the world's first self-righting object."

2007-12-09T00:00:00Z,"Cardboard Bridge, The When the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban was asked to build a footbridge over the Gardon River in the south of France, he designed one that was keenly sensitive to its surroundings. He constructed it from locally available materials and based its geometry on the nearby Pont du Gard, a historic Roman aqueduct. But instead of stones or concrete, Ban used a mixture of cardboard tubes, recycled labels and creative engineering. This summer, the surprisingly strong structure -- it can withstand the load of at least 20 people -- rose triumphantly against the backdrop of the ancient monument. The 72-foot-long frame was made primarily from 281 cardboard tubes -- each four and a half inches in diameter and about three-quarters of an inch thick. The tubes were held together by steel joints. For the steps, Ban used a new material called ProFi, assembled from paper and plastic left over from the manufacture of self-adhesive labels. Wooden boxes buried underground and packed with local sand formed the foundations."
2007-12-09T00:00:00Z,"COMMUNITY URINALYSIS Everyone knows how a drug test works: You urinate into a cup and your employer (or prospective employer) has the sample tested to see if you've been using any illegal substances. This year, though, Jennifer Field, an environmental chemist at Oregon State University, experimented with an unusual variation on this process. She found out what illicit drugs the population of an entire city was ingesting. How? By collecting and then testing water from the city's sewage-treatment plant. Since all drug users urinate, and since the urine eventually winds up in the sewers, Field and her fellow researchers figured that sewer water would contain traces of whatever drugs the citizens were using."

Did you always want to be the editor of Commentary? I never wanted to be editor of Commentary, at least not after the age of 7, when children seem to think, largely because of fairy tales, that they ascend to the position their parents hold upon their parents' death. But you did get into the magazine field early on. In 1995, you were among the three founders of The Weekly Standard, which is snappier than Commentary and quickly surpassed it circulation-wise. In the '90s, the Clinton years, conservative magazines exploded. The classic rule of thumb is that if you are an intellectual ideological magazine, you do better in opposition than you do if your views are reflected by people in power."

Devoted husband of the late Elizabeth McMahan, father of Carolann, Edmund, William and John. An expert on group dynamics, he taught at Columbia for 30 years, advised industry and government, and helped bring banking into under served areas of the Bronx.

2007-12-09T00:00:00Z,"Nature and fashion in Manhattan underwent a spectacular 10-day metamorphosis from late November's golden foliage to winter's minimalist tones, with freezing winds, dustings of snow and icy lakes in Central Park. Women on Fifth Avenue did not miss a beat, wearing snowy white coats, some with fox-portrait collars recalling Hollywood's glamour stars of the 1930s. But one woman welcomed the season by wearing a pencil-slim coat of silvery brocade -- chinchilla fur at the collar, cuffs and hem -- with gray flannel narrow trousers and an envelope bag tucked under the arm."
2007-12-09T00:00:00Z,"LEFT-HAND-TURN ELIMINATION [28] It seems that sitting in the left lane, engine idling, waiting for oncoming traffic to clear so you can make a left-hand turn, is minutely wasteful -- of time and peace of mind, for sure, but also of gas and therefore money. Not a ton of gas and money if we're talking about just you and your Windstar, say, but immensely wasteful if we're talking about more than 95,000 big square brown trucks delivering packages every day. And this realization -- that when you operate a gigantic fleet of vehicles, tiny improvements in the efficiency of each one will translate to huge savings overall -- is what led U.P.S. to limit further the number of left-hand turns its drivers make. The company employs what it calls a ''package flow'' software program, which among other hyperefficient practices involving the packing and sorting of its cargo, maps out routes for every one of its drivers, drastically reducing the number of left-hand turns they make (taking into consideration, of course, those instances where not to make the left-hand turn would result in a ridiculously circuitous route)."
2007-12-09T00:00:00Z,"You've just been named the next editor of Commentary, which became the voice of the neoconservative movement in the '70s under the stewardship of your famous father, Norman. Did you always want to be the editor of Commentary? I never wanted to be editor of Commentary, at least not after the age of 7, when children seem to think, largely because of fairy tales, that they ascend to the position their parents hold upon their parents' death. But you did get into the magazine field early on. In 1995, you were among the three founders of The Weekly Standard, which is snappier than Commentary and quickly surpassed it circulation-wise. In the '90s, the Clinton years, conservative magazines exploded. The classic rule of thumb is that if you are an intellectual ideological magazine, you do better in opposition than you do if your views are reflected by people in power."

Any number of examples could be cited to support this proposition, but let's focus first on the foiled plot in the summer of 2006 to blow up several jetliners over the United States with liquid explosives. Because no technology had been developed to detect or thwart liquid explosives, the Transportation Security Administration was forced to take, for a time, the draconian step of banning all liquids and gels.

He occasionally revealed himself to be, or to seem to be, an elitist, self-absorbed twit callously indifferent to the cares and woes of lesser mortals.

A month ago Washington had moved on to speculating about her running mate (my guess if she wins Iowa: Tom Vilsack); now she's in a three-way tie in Iowa and losing her lead in New Hampshire faster than Mitt Romney changes positions. Is she seriously in danger of coming undone? Is she still in command of the race? There is an appropriately Clintonian way to answer these questions, which is yes to both.The first presidential campaign I covered was Bill Bradley's 2000 run against Al Gore. (I met my wife on that campaign, so it wasn't a total loss.) People forget this now, but there was a moment, at about this time in 1999, when Mr. Bradley came stunningly close to stealing the Democratic nomination. Mr. Gore was a sitting vice president, with all of the institutional support in the party, as well as the labor unions and the interest groups and the big-money bundlers and the bulletproof limo and, of course, the prosperity and relative peace of the Clinton years at his back. And yet here was Mr. Bradley, three years removed from his last public office, surging to a lead in New Hampshire and gaining so much ground in Iowa, a state in which he hadn't even planned to compete, that his campaign decided to send dozens of staff there. (It was, in retrospect, a huge tactical blunder, but Iowa is like that, tantalizingly within reach one minute and 56,000 square miles of pure quicksand the next.) In those tense weeks, you could almost hear the monstrous machinery of the Democratic establishment squeak as it teetered away from Gore."

Forty-nine years ago, Herb and Dick Lieb decided to practice law together, and, as they say, the rest is history. He was the soul of the law firm: a valued counselor, conciliator, builder and leader, a source of unflagging energy, and a devoted and loyal friend. Above all, he was a humanitarian who made a difference in countless organizations, particularly among Jewish charities here, in the former Soviet Union and in Israel. We extend our deep sympathy to his children Susan and David and to his brother Paul, to their spouses and to the entire family. We will miss his warm smile and big heart forever. May his memory be for a blessing. KRONISH--Herbert. Congregation Ohav Sholom, Merrick, deeply mourns the passing of our Founder and Honorary Life President.

He was an exemplary son to his parents, the late Ben and Tobie Kronish, a loving brother of Paul and Naomi, a devoted brother-in-law of Martha and Bert Robbins. He held his role as cousin, uncle, granduncle, and friend in the highest esteem and love. Throughout his lifetime, he devoted his vast energy to Israel, Soviet Jewry, and to ways of insuring Jewish continuity. As a Founder and Honorary Life President of Congregation Ohav Shalom in Merrick, LI, through his active involvements with UJA Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, as a Chairman of the Greater NY Conference on Soviet Jewry, and as the Director of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee he demonstrated the strength of his commitment to Judaism. Additionally, he was the founding partner of the law firm Kronish, Lieb, Weiner & Hellman, LLP. To this and all his endeavors, he brought passionate commitment, vision and the pursuit of excellence.

2007-12-12T00:00:00Z,"If an interest in conservation has inspired you to cross caviar from wild Caspian Sea sturgeon off your holiday shopping list, you still have plenty of choices. Germany, France, Italy, Israel, Dubai and Uruguay are some of the places that have jumped into the business of farming sturgeon for caviar. California was one of the earliest to develop a caviar industry and now, more than 15 years of experience have paid off with consistent quality from the two producers, Sterling and Tsar Nicoulai. They are likely to be the least expensive sources for good caviar this season. Both companies offer several grades from a type of sturgeon called transmontanus, or white sturgeon, from basic black to some with larger beads and paler hints of gold and gray, at higher prices. It all has to do with how the roe is sorted as it is harvested. Samples purchased from www.sterlingcaviar.com and www.tsarnicoulai.com, showed stylistic differences between the products; which to choose is a matter of taste."

2007-12-12T00:00:00Z,"Two airplanes that reached close proximity at Kennedy International Airport on Sunday were no closer than half a mile apart, the Federal Aviation Administration said on Tuesday. Air traffic controllers complained on Monday that the two planes, a Boeing 747 cargo plane and a 37-seat commuter jet, nearly collided when the cargo plane, which had been assigned to land, aborted the landing and went around for another try, crossing a perpendicular runway where the commuter jet was assigned to land. The smaller plane then also aborted its landing. The planes were at their closest when both were 200 feet above the ground. A spokeswoman for the F.A.A., Laura J. Brown, said that the encounter did not break flight safety rules because the crew of the smaller plane could see the cargo jet and thus avoid hitting it. The controllers argue that the simultaneous use of runways at right angles to each other raises risks."

Suddaby, has been investigating links between Mr. Bruno's business associates and their dealings with the state. Mr. Bruno has insisted he has done nothing wrong, and no one has been charged in the case. Mr. Suddaby was appointed United States attorney for New York's Northern District in 2002. Mr. Suddaby's nomination is supported by Charles E. Schumer, New York's senior senator and an influential Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

It's a great portrait, rendered skeptically but without cynicism, and I highly recommend it. What's occurred to me as I've read stories about Mr. Huckabee over these last few months - I've not yet met him - is that you can already see how, should he manage to win the nomination, he would deftly steer himself back toward the political center in time for the convention. The outlines of the post-primary Huckabee storyline have already emerged: he raised some taxes over his own party's objections, he refused to deny scholarships to illegal immigrants (a decision he has refused to back away from ""even if it costs me he election""), he came off as too liberal and secular for a lot of his fellow Baptist preachers. These lines from the Huckabee resume have earned him the scorn of some Republican interest groups, most notably the anti-tax Club for Growth, whose idea of state government consists of a couple of prisons and a paving machine, but they would serve him nicely in a general election, where independent voters might shrink from electing another rigid conservative. Campaign reporters always line up to write stories like this, not because they care about making the Mike Huckabees of the world seem kind and gentle, which he may well be, but because we in the media are trained to look for the contradiction of stereotypes - and no one is more gleefully stereotyped in America than the religious conservative. Thus we in the media have historically embraced the story of the Republican governor who, it turns out, isn't as much of a crazy conservative as you might think. Hey, look, the Tin Man has a heart! George W. Bush was a ""compassionate conservative"" who worked amiably across the aisle with Democrats. Mitt Romney passed a landmark, bipartisan bill to provide healthcare. Even Ronald Reagan enacted a huge tax increase while governor of California. And so on."

But it's hard to see how a theatrical event that includes miniature paper sculptures of animals, George Manahan conducting the Juilliard Ensemble and (this is important) Isaac Mizrahi could fail to delight anybody. Mr. Mizrahi, the wickedly charismatic fashion designer, will be narrating ''Peter and the Wolf'' as part of the Works and Process series at the Guggenheim Museum, and will be topping off his outsize personality with a wolf's hat designed by Kelly Christy. The Prokofiev classic is only a half-hour long, and people are encouraged afterward to wander around the Peter B. Lewis Theater, which will be filled with an installation (above, a detail) by the young Brooklyn artist Andrew Scott Ross. The consulting producer, Charles Fabius, hopes to start a ''Peter and the Wolf'' holiday tradition, with a different artist each year; he mentioned Jeff Koons as having an interest in a future project."

2007-12-14T00:00:00Z,"Damien Hirst has donated to the Tate museum in London four of his works, including a bisected cow and calf in formaldehyde and a canvas of dead flies, Bloomberg News reported. As prices for contemporary art have soared over the last decade, museums have been struggling to buy works by leading figures including Mr. Hirst, who, at 42, is Britain's wealthiest artist, with assets, including art, estimated at $265 million by The Sunday Times of London. The Tate said his donation was the first part of a ''major gift of works.'' The donations include a 2007 exhibition copy of ''Mother and Child Divided,'' comprising the cow and calf; the 2002 fly painting ''Who Is Afraid of the Dark?,'' ''The Acquired Inability to Escape'' (1991), a large vitrine with cigarette stubs and ''Life Without You'' (1991), a seashell arrangement on a desk. ''It means a lot to me to have works in the Tate,'' Mr. Hirst said in a statement. ''I've been in negotiations with the Tate for a few years to make sure they get the right pieces to represent me properly.''"

At a meeting in Zurich, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Slovakia, Sweden and Switzerland decided to exercise their right to revisit the deal between the International Ice Hockey Federation member associations, their leagues and the N.H.L.

2007-12-14T00:00:00Z,"INGRID MICHAELSON A year ago Ingrid Michaelson was an aspiring singer-songwriter on Staten Island with a MySpace page and a dream. And along with her soulful, idiosyncratic music, that's all she needed. After being discovered online by a music licensing company, four of her songs were included on ABC's ''Grey's Anatomy,'' and an Old Navy commercial showcased her song ''The Way I Am'' (a k a the Sweater Song), which combines whimsical lyrics, '60s girl-group harmonies and a lilting Caribbean beat. ''You hear it once and you instantly connect,'' Rick Krim, the executive vice president for music and talent at VH1, said of ''The Way I Am.'' Currently Ms. Michaelson, above, is featured on that channel's new-artist program, ''You Oughta Know,'' which has also spotlighted Amy Winehouse, Feist and James Blunt. It's the first time VH1 has played an unsigned artist. Mr. Krim said he and his colleagues were making an exception because of their passion for Ms. Michaelson's music. ''People are playing it on the radio because they love it,'' he said. ''The way it used to be in the old days.''"

2007-12-14T00:00:00Z,"PICK UP PERFORMANCE COMPANY David Gordon's latest dance-theater feat, ''Uncivil Wars: Collaborating With Brecht & Eisler,'' is a dizzying experience, immediately plunging viewers into a thicket of overlapping references, realities and characters (not to mention artistic forms). A typically agile, bare-bones Gordon set of folding chairs, ladders and scaffolding swirls around the action, manipulated by members of his Pick Up Performance Company, above, even as they deliver their lines. The original play is ''The Roundheads and the Pointheads'' (translated by Michael Feingold, with music by Hanns Eisler), but, as is his wont, Mr. Gordon has edited and played with Brecht's script a good deal. The resulting creation is deliciously heady. Part rumination on artistic ownership, part elaboration of his continuing critique of current American politics, part something else entirely, ''Uncivil Wars'' functions via Mr. Gordon's singular physical and linguistic logic. The delicate rhymes and cadences embedded in the songs and dialogue carry you along, as does the ceaseless but never busy movement of set and cast."

Chinese art dominates, partly because the current market is boiling and partly because, simply, some of the best art being made today is from China. For evidence you might visit ChinaSquare, a new gallery dedicated to Chinese art and located high in the Chelsea Arts Tower. Inside the gallery is a spirited group show put together by Fang Lei and Jonathan Goodman, featuring the work of a dozen contemporary Chinese artists, among them emerging talents like Cao Xiaodong, Shen Jingdong and Jing Kewen, as well as the veterans Zhang Hongtu and Li Luming. ''Revolution'' is the overarching theme, with the central idea being to spotlight the influence of propaganda imagery from the Cultural Revolution (about 1966-76) in the work of contemporary artists. It's imagery that was made to serve political ends and promote revolutionary spirit among the Chinese people."

The conference is being described as the most significant political event in the country since the first democratic elections after the collapse of apartheid in 1994.

2007-12-16T00:00:00Z,"KOCZY--Rosemarie Inge 68, of Croton-on-Hudson, NY, internationally renowned artist, succumbed on December 12, 2007 to inflammatory breast cancer. Born March 5, 1939 in Reckling-hausen, Germany to Jewish parents, she was deported in 1942 and survived two concentration camps. In 1959 she left Germany for Geneva to study art at the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs. Graduating with distinction in 1965, she soon gained recognition throughout Europe as a tapestry maker. A chance encounter with Peggy Guggenheim in Venice in 1973 led to an abiding friendship (and the commissioning of a tapestry) and contact with then Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum director Thomas Messer. By the mid-1970's the unexpressed trauma of her early years forced a change of direction in her work toward an open acknowledgment of the Holocaust. By the time Koczy accepted a fellowship to the MacDowell Colony in 1980 at Messer's invitation, she had already begun to create the signature pen and ink drawings memorializing the victims of the Shoah reverenced today throughout the world. In addition to hundreds of paintings, wood sculptures and other works, they alone numbered over 12,000 at the time of her death. Of them she wrote: ''The drawings I make every day are titled 'I Weave You A Shroud.' They are burials to those I saw die in camps.'' Esteemed in both mainstream and outsider art worlds but in the moral dimension apart from both, Koczy's work renowned in the Guggenheim, the Collection de l'Art Brut in Lausanne and Jerusalem's Yad Vashem, to give partial sense of its reach. Rosemarie Koczy's first marriage (which brought her Swiss citizenship) ended in divorce. She wed composer Louis Pelosi in 1984 and became an American citizen in 1989. She is survived by her husband, a sister Gisela and a half-brother Walter, both of Germany. She was interred at Bethel Cemetery, Croton on December 14. Her gravestone will read: ''I weave you a shroud...of love.''"

2007-12-16T00:00:00Z,"Mike Huckabee walked into the lobby of the Des Moines Marriott at 5:30 a.m. on Dec. 3, deposited an armful of dirty laundry at the desk and checked to make sure he was being credited with Marriott Rewards points toward his next stay. Then, accompanied by his wife, Janet, his daughter, Sarah, and his press secretary, Alice Stewart -- who doubles as his Boston Marathon trainer -- he walked into the dark, freezing morning, climbed into a waiting S.U.V. and headed for Central College in Pella, Iowa. Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, was in a buoyant mood on three hours of sleep. The night before, his commercial flight suffered a long Chicago holdover on the way from Boston, but he had reason to hope that his days at the mercy of the airlines might be numbered. A Des Moines Register opinion poll had just shown Huckabee passing Mitt Romney to take the lead in the run-up to the Jan. 3 caucus. His picture, he already knew, was on the front page of that morning's USA Today. Now he was headed to Central College, to appear, surrounded by enthusiastic students, on ''The Early Show'' on CBS. This kind of momentum, he hoped, would finally produce enough cash to allow him to charter his own plane. The governor was especially happy that morning about an impending endorsement he expected (and received the following day) from Tim LaHaye, the author of the apocalyptic ''Left Behind'' series of novels. ''Left Behind'' is wildly popular among evangelicals, who have bought more than 65 million copies, making LaHaye a very rich man and one of the few writers who is also a major philanthropist. Recently he donated a hockey rink to Jerry Falwell's Liberty University, although some members of the faculty there deride ''Left Behind'' as science fiction. Huckabee, an ordained Southern Baptist minister, has no such reservations. He considers the ''Left Behind'' books, in which the world comes to a violent end as Jesus triumphs over Satan, a ''compelling story written for nontheologians.''"

BEHIND THE NEWS In each case, an appeals court overturned a sentence imposed by a trial judge that was lighter than called for by the federal guidelines, after prosecutors had complained. In one of the cases, the trial judge disagreed with guidelines that require much harsher sentences for crack-cocaine possession than for the possession of an equivalent amount of powdered cocaine."

He was the beloved husband of Mary, and cherished father of Anthony, Charles and Francis and their wives, Lulu, Nancy and Laura. He was much beloved by his seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He was also the much loved brother of Hsiang-Ming Hsia. He graduated from Soochow University School of Law in 1938. He practiced law in Shanghai until 1945 when he was recruited to be a judge of the Court of Appeals for Shanghai. In 1947 he was awarded a fellowship by Harvard University School of Law where he earned an LLM degree. He returned to China in 1948 to resume his law practice and to teach at Soochow University Law School. In 1949 he became President of Aurora College for Women. In 1952 Professor Wang and his family moved to the U.S. and he joined the faculty of St. John's University School of Law in New York City. He was invited to serve as Visiting Professor of Law at Michigan University Law School in 1963. In 1964 he was invited by President Lyndon B. Johnson to participate in the White House Conference on International Law and International Cooperation. In addition to his professorship at St. John's, he was also on the panel of Arbitrators of The American Arbitration Association. By the time he retired as Professor of Law at St. John's in 1984, he had taught and inspired generations of young lawyers and future leaders in business and government. After his retirement from St. John's, Professor Wang became the senior partner of Wang and Wang in Taipei, a law firm specializing in transnational law. St. John's honored him in 1984 with the President's Medal, in 1987 with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree, and in 1992 with the Medal of Honor. In 2003, Soochow University honored him with the naming of the Kenneth Wang School of Law. He will always be honored in the hearts of his family, friends and students. Services were private. In lieu of flowers, remembrances may be sent to St. John's University School of Law, in support of the Kenneth Wang International Fellowship, at 8000 Utopia Parkway, Queens, NY 11439."

Livezey, Professor of Urban and Religious Studies and Director of the Ecologies of Learning Project at the Seminary. Dr. Livezey directed large studies of urban congregations, using ethnographic data assembled in collaboration with colleagues and students in Chicago, Boston, and New York. He argued that the ''religion factor'' is more salient than often recognized in the economic, demographic, and spatial restructuring of modern industrial cities. Dr. Livezey received the B.A. from Swarthmore College and the M. Th. and D. Min. degrees from the University of Chicago School of Divinity. He spent two decades in the peace movement before beginning his second career in studying communities, meanings, culture, and social change. In 2005, Dr. Livezey became the founding Director of the Ecologies of Learning Project (EOL) at NYTS, funded through a major grant from Lilly Endowment Inc. Lowell Livezey was a person of immense insight, wisdom and compassion, of great integrity and depth, and an outstanding colleague. He embodied the values of teaching, learning and research that lie at the heart of the scholarly endeavor. He also was a friend, a caring human being, someone around whom community was easily formed. In the language that is familiar to the people of faith, Lowell simply was a blessing to NYTS. Lowell helped us all understand the life and work of the churches and especially the intellectual task of preparation for ministry more clearly. Dr. Craig Dykstra, Senior Vice President, Religion of Lilly Endowment Inc., stated that ''Lowell Livezey's work on religion and urban culture is path-breaking -a permanent contribution. His patient, generous and imaginative work with pastors and other religious leaders in Chicago, Boston and New York, as well as with scholars, will bear great fruit for many years to come.'' Dr. Livezey is survived by his wife, Dr. Lois Gehr Livezey, Director of the Globalization Project of the Center for World Christianity at NYTS. Contributions in Dr. Livezey's memory may be made to the Lowell W. Livezey Fund, Ecologies of Learning, New York Theological Seminary, 475 Riverside Drive, Suite 500, New York, NY 10115.

There has been dismay about a political moment in which it seems a candidate must pass a religious litmus test to gain national viability. There have been comparisons to John F.

2007-12-16T00:00:00Z,"CHEREN--Melvin. (January 21, 1933-December 7, 2007) Affectionately known as ''The Godfather of Disco'' for his championing of DJs, dance music and club culture from the early days of the Disco Movement, Mel began his five decade career in the music business at ABC/Paramount, where he eventually became Head of Production. He held the same position when he moved to Scepter Records. During his tenure at Scepter he was responsible for many innovations such as the first 12 inch record for DJs and the first instrumental mix on the B-side, earning Scepter the ''Trendsetter of the Year'' Award from Billboard in 1974. With a former Scepter colleague he formed his own company, West End Records in 1976, which has been associated for over 30 years with enduring dance classics like ''Hot Shot'' and ''Heartbeat''. In recent years West End released popular compilation CD's of remixes and live performances by legendary Paradise Garage DJ Larry Levan. Mel was the financial backer of the landmark club created by his former life-partner Michael Brody. This history is well documented in Cheren's autobiography, My Life and the Paradise Garage: Keep on Dancin' published in 2000 and in a recent documentary, The Godfather of Disco. In 2005 Mel was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame with their Lifetime Achievement Award, an honor which meant a great deal to him. For all of his accomplishments in the music industry, Mel was most proud of his work in support of various causes and charities and in particular his efforts in support of the LGBT Community and the fight against AIDS. He was part of the vanguard of gay men who first responded to the AIDS crisis in New York in the early Eighties and gave GMHC their first home in his Chelsea brownstone which he later operated for over 20 years as a successful bed-and-breakfast, the Colonial House Inn. He was the founder of 24 Hours For Life, an AIDS charity that was the fiscal sponsor for LIFEbeat, on whose Board he served as a Charter Director. Mel was also quietly a friend to many friends and strangers in need as well as an accomplished painter. A large number of Mel's works of art memorialize friends lost to AIDS. It is a sad irony that he is a fatality of the same health crisis that he fought so long to eradicate. Even in his last days he took a stand for AIDS prevention in a cautionary interview aired on the LOGO channel throughout the week of World AIDS Day. Mel Cheren is survived and will be greatly missed by many family members, prominent among them being Illya Dekhtyar, Mark Cheren and Barry Cherin, as well as a large extended family of close friends, colleagues and fellow activists. An announcement will soon be made about a memorial service/celebration and various memorial benefit parties taking place over the third weekend in January which would have marked his 75th birthday. Donations in Mel's honor can be made to GMHC, 119 West 24th Street, New York, New York 10011; The LGBT Community Center at 208 West 13th Street, New York, New York 10011; or LIFEbeat, 630 9th Avenue Suite 1010 New York, New York 10036."

The standards, sponsored by Senators Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, and Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, would have restricted what could be sold in vending machines and would have eliminated foods high in fat and sugar from à la carte menus that supplement school lunches, which are regulated by the Department of Agriculture. A crush of procedural maneuvers kept the amendment from being added to the final version of the bill, which the Senate passed Thursday. But because the plan was written by an unusual alliance of school food reform advocates and food industry representatives, lawmakers and others who worked on it said the ban could be revived as a stand-alone bill or attached to other legislation in 2008."

2007-12-18T00:00:00Z,"A water-conservation measure that fishermen said would devastate the Florida Panhandle's oyster industry has been delayed, the governors of three drought-stricken Southeastern states said as they pledged to speed talks on sharing water during scarcities. The Bush administration had brokered a plan last month to reduce flows into the Apalachicola River, which feeds a major oyster breeding ground in Florida. That short-term effort to bolster Atlanta's drinking supply drew opposition from oystermen and environmentalists who said it would further damage species already hit hard by one of the region's worst droughts in years. The governors of Florida, Georgia and Alabama and the federal government agreed not to reduce, for now, the minimum amount of water that will flow into Apalachicola Bay. The governors also agreed that their staffs would continue to work together to come up with a plan for doling out the region's water by March 15, faster than had been expected."

2007-12-18T00:00:00Z,"The 1980 United States Olympians who never had a chance to compete at the Moscow Games are finally officially gold medalists. Not Olympic medals, but rather Congressional Gold Medals that were awarded to the 461 Olympic athletes during the Carter administration. The medals were never officially recorded in the Congressional Record because of technical problems with their production.The United States boycotted the 1980 Olympics to protest the Soviet Union's military operation in Afghanistan. The Congressional Record from that year shows that Congress intended to award the Congressional Gold Medals to the Olympians to record the sacrifice they made -- having trained for games in which they never competed.The United States Mint produced the medals, but because they were expensive, financial constraints forced them to be gold-plated bronze medals instead of solid gold. Because of that difference, the Olympians were never officially documented as having received Congressional Gold Medals. Encouraged by the swimmer Ron Neugent; Representative Todd Tiahrt, Republican of Kansas; and Jim Scherr, the chief executive of the United States Olympic committee, the House had the record corrected."

In Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael L. Stern ruled that the woman, Tyna Marie Robertson, a real estate agent, had defamed and inflicted emotional distress on Mr. Flatley, who starred in ''Riverdance'' and ''Lord of the Dance.'' Ms. Robertson accused Mr. Flatley of raping her in a Las Vegas hotel in 2002 and threatened to sue unless he agreed to a ''seven figures'' settlement. The police declined to bring criminal charges against the dancer, who said the sex was consensual. She then sued him for $33 million, alleging sexual assault. The suit was dismissed. Mr. Flatley responded with a lawsuit against Ms. Robertson and her lawyer D. Dean Mauro. The Supreme Court of California ruled in July 2006 that Mr. Mauro committed extortion; he settled by making ''a substantial payment'' to Mr. Flatley, according to the dancer's lawyer, Richard P.

Active in Greek cultural and church activities throughout her youth and adult life, Mary wed Nicholas in 1951. She pursued a successful career in women's fashion in New York, working on many collections for the couture designer, Mary McFadden, taking time from her vacation to raise her three dear children to be immersed in the Greek culture and language. The children and grandchildren enjoy frequent trips to Greece, where their fluency in the language is a constant reminder of their mother's love and devotion. Mary retired in 1986, enojoying 10 years with her beloved husband before his passing. Mary moved to Los Angeles in 2003, where her greatest joy was derived from spending time with her adoring grandchildren, for whom she cooked in the Greek style, preparing their favorite dishes at ''Yiayia's'' house.

2007-12-21T00:00:00Z,"Heat-seeking golfers who favor Scottsdale, Ariz., will encounter a curious phenomenon this winter: What’s old is new. November witnessed extreme makeovers applied to two of the Sonoran Desert’s “must-play” destinations, Troon North and the TPC Scottsdale. Troon North’s tweaks are the more subtle. Its Saguaro-laced Monument and Pinnacle courses have been rated as Arizona’s top two public-access tracks for than 10 years, but the layout routed players in confusing directions. After much soul-searching, Troon Golf executives split up the vaunted Monument layout, pairing its old back nine with the old back nine of the Pinnacle to form a “new” Pinnacle course. The “new” Monument course is comprised of the old front nines. Original designer Tom Weiskopf resurfaced the greens and reworked the bunkers to achieve a consistent look throughout. The result is better flow. Gone are the “Where-in-the-world-am-I-going” cart rides that slowed up play considerably. Monument is the more spectacular of the two, with gigantic rocks and elevation changes at every turn, but Pinnacle is tougher — and, in a rarity for the desert, is a walkable course, even if it’s ninth hole doesn’t return to the clubhouse."

Heebonism, a creation of Heeb Magazine, is a party that's essentially ''a bunch of wild and crazy Jews running around -- and non-Jews too,'' said Brian Abrams, a writer who says his official position at Heeb is dreidel hustler. In addition to sets by D.J. Krowd Pleezr and others, the thousand or so who are expected to attend can take part in Christmas carol karaoke and strip dreidel, a variant on the dreidel game that Mr. Abrams says involves shedding garments instead of chocolate.

He often proudly explained as a young man that, in addition to Europe, he had lived in six states across America and attended five schools prior to entering Harvard College, from which he graduated in January 1943. Following three years of service in World War II, largely as an Artillery officer in the 10th Mountain Division, including its combat experience in Italy, he returned to the Harvard Business School and received his masters degree in 1948. Mr. Downer's nearly four decade oil industry career began in that year with the Continental Oil Company in Ponca City, Oklahoma. He later joined Sinclair Oil Corporation in New York and rose to become Executive Vice President and Director of that company. In 1969 he played a prominent role in the union of Sinclair and Atlantic Richfield, which up to that time was among the largest industrial mergers in United States business history. Over the next seventeen years, including the development of the Prudhoe Bay Field in Alaska and the Trans Alaska Pipeline, Mr. Downer served as Executive Vice President and Director, and later Vice Chairman and Director of Arco. In addition to the Sinclair and Atlantic Richfield boards, Mr. Downer was at various times a director of the Anaconda Company, Lockheed Corporation, Fiduciary Trust Company International and Cherokee Resources Company. Always close to Harvard University, which he had attended as a scholarship and G. I. Bill student, he served during the academic year 1983-1984 as President of the Harvard Alumni Association, and for many years as a member of the Committee on University Resources and the Visiting Committee of the Kennedy School of Government. Among other volunteer posts which he held over his career were Vice Chairman KCET Public Television in Los Angeles, Trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Trustee of the Foreign Policy Association of New York, a member of the Grace Commission on the Cost of Government during the Reagan Administration, and a vestry member of St. John's Episcopal Church. Mr. Downer is survived by his wife Louise Swenson Downer; a daughter, Jannett Downer Sayre of Cherry Hills Village, CO, and two sons, William Tucker of Hoboken, NJ and John Ashton (Tony) of Stamford, CT, three stepchildren and six grandchildrne. His marriage to Jannett Tucker Downer of New York City, who also survived, ended in divorce. Donations may be made to Harvard College or St. John's Episcopal Church of Cold Spring Harbor, NY."

2007-12-21T00:00:00Z,"'A KID'S LIFE' What would ''Sesame Street'' be like without Oscar the Grouch? A possible answer is ''A Kid's Life,'' which recently opened at the York Theater Company. Although this production also has upbeat songs, cheery lessons in the workings of the world and adults dressed in oversize fuzzy costumes, it features little of the inspired wit and occasionally acerbic observations that have made ''Sesame Street'' so ingenious. While clouds sometimes gather over that neighborhood, the nameless little town in ''A Kid's Life'' is virtually all sunshine, all the time. Not that children under 7 are likely to mind. Even though they were absent from the performance I attended (bad weather had caused school audiences to cancel), it was easy to imagine them enthralled. ''A Kid's Life'' follows a small boy named Zack (Carlos Avilas, above right) and his dog, Starsky (Yoav Levin), as they meet Zoe (Ashley Wallace) and introduce her to the neighborhood. Over the course of an hour little theatergoers have the opportunity to bat balloons through the audience, clap and sing to the music and shout instructions to the actors."

2007-12-21T00:00:00Z,"CATHERINE LEE: 'THE MARK PAINTINGS 1977-79' It is not often that a gallery presents a body of work that an artist created 30 years ago, especially when much of it was never shown. It is even rarer that the artist agrees to the show. But that is what Galerie Lelong has unveiled for the holiday season: a survey of drawings and paintings by the Minimalist Catherine Lee produced in New York from 1977 to 1979. Back then artists weren't trying to earn a million dollars in their first year out of art school, or flirting at Art Basel Miami Beach with the next Whitney Biennial curatorial team. They were busy reducing art to its essences, to words, spaces, lines and marks. Ms. Lee was among them, producing tightly pared-back, serial paintings using obsessive and repetitive markings laid down in a strict grid structure, never deviating from the mission or allowing her imagination or emotion to enter the creative process (left, a detail of ''Painting #3,'' 1978). The concentration required to produce the two dozen works here was phenomenal, though the images themselves can at times look a little monotonous."

Roskultura, the state cultural agency, said it feared that British courts could seize the art on behalf of descendants of people who owned the paintings before they were confiscated after the Russian revolution of 1917. A spokesman for the British Embassy in Moscow said assurances already given were sufficient for the safety of the art planned for the exhibition, ''From Russia: French and Russian Art Masterpieces of 1870-1925.'' But, he added: ''We also believe that cultural relations between Britain and Russia are of tremendous importance.

''Dreamscapes,'' the chamberlike suite that he unveils this weekend, marks his first attempt at writing music for strings. It's also his most conceptually oriented work, inspired not only by dreaming itself but also a set of dream-related poems contributed by Andy Bragen, a friend and playwright. Mr. Ellis, above, has been composing successfully on a smaller scale for more than a decade. But his best work dates from the last few years, when he left a sideman post with the guitarist Charlie Hunter and decisively struck out on his own. ''By a Thread'' (Hyena), his most recent album, features nine refreshingly uncontrived pieces for a modern jazz quintet; some of them, like ''Umpty Eleven,'' sound effortless despite their convolutions. The style echoes Mr. Ellis's easygoing but assertive instrumental voice, informed by his studies in North Carolina, New Orleans and New York."

2007-12-22T14:36:39Z,"Re ""A Semi-Nude Minor? In The Times?"" (Dec. 16): While I can appreciate the fact that T magazine might not have been the most appropriate venue for this photo editorial, it is interesting to see how it has been perceived by so many people.It is also fascinating that people think that they have the right to judge so severely and with such vengeance.Perhaps these are the same people who would not enter an art museum unless the statues were covered in drapes. In Europe, the pictures in question would never elicit the least bit of controversy.There is nothing ""minor"" about Ali. She is an old soul who is an extremely intelligent, focused, disciplined, responsible young lady. She is as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside. While she is a few months shy of her 18th birthday, she is more mature than most adults twice her age.She has had the good fortune to work with some of the world's best-known photographers over the past two years, including Paolo Roversi. He is an icon in the fashion industry. While I am with Ali every step of the way, it is not up to me to choose which photographs are to be published. I do not have control over that decision-making process. That said, there is nothing remotely sexual or pornographic about the pictures in the T. In my eyes, they portray a sense of innocence and beauty.To those who have responded to your column by criticizing my daughter and me so vehemently: Please understand that I have my viewpoint, and you have yours. It is unacceptable for you to demand that we think exactly alike, and it is unconscionable that you feel the need to judge or attack while expressing your views. After all, we come from totally different backgrounds and perspectives and are each entitled to our opinions.Art and beauty are in the eye of the beholder. If you don't like what you see, keep in mind that no one is forcing you to look. MaryAnn MichaelColleyville, Tex., Dec. 19, 2007 ● On the one hand, you're right. I don't read T. On the other hand, now that you bring it up, those photos of that 17-year-old model are not fit for a newspaper with general circulation.Exposing as much as possible of a minor's body for commercial gain (but without getting arrested) is immoral, no matter how artful the photography.The Times can find some other way to sell its paper than exploiting even a willing minor whose parents care more about her career than about the character of our culture.J. Christy WarehamNewark, N.Y., Dec. 16, 2007 "" ● Jim Schachter, a deputy editor of The New York Times Magazine, justifies his decision to expose a youngster's breast in a fashion spread by blurring the line separating commercial images from ""art.""He acknowledges that ""sexually charged"" images sell products, so does he really suffer under the same illusion as the mother of the 17-year-old model, who found the layout to be ""very artistic in nature""? Have we become so cynical that the currency of a young body can be peddled as ""art"" even in the most commercial of contexts?Rebecca ReichmannRancho Santa Fe, Calif., Dec. 17, 2007 ● I guess I am glad I never buy the Sunday Times. It's not so much that I disapprove of the T magazine section (I've never seen it, I think), but that I would resent paying for it and disposing of it greenly.I do buy and read the daily Times every day, and subscribe to the Book Review. Much of the reason I don't buy the Sunday Times is that there is so much in it I really have no interest in.Emily Ann SchmalzerBrentwood, N.H., Dec. 17, 2007 ● Ordinarily I automatically dump T in the T-rash without even opening it, along with other glossy ads for things I'll never need or want. But your column prodded me to have a look online at the 17-year-old model posing semi-nude.What a disappointment! She's no Lolita, just an underweight kid posing in a grown-up's overpriced duds. And that barely perceptible bare breast was so badly out of focus that it registered zero on both the photographic and sexuality meters.The only astonishing thing about the photos was the revelation that a $3,890 Galliano taffeta coat could be worn, as the caption states, as a skirt.No, these photos didn't register as pornographic nor tawdry - nor even edgy. Aaron EpsteinWashington, Dec. 16, 2007 ● Can fashion photographs be ""art""? The word was used by many cited in your column.I have just viewed the photos of Ali Michael. I find an unmistakable reference to Degas' sculpture of the 14-year-old dancer in the focused photo with a taffeta coat: the tied hair, the arms straight behind the back, the use of material in an original way, not to mention the insecurity of youth bravely confronting the hostilities of the world, including that of sexual exploitation.The great difference for these two models is, of course, exposure. Degas' model posed in private; the resulting sculpture became the vehicle of expression.Ms. Michael is viewed by millions and is herself, to a far greater extent, the vehicle of expression. Her body has, in a sense, been designed to meet certain criteria of the modeling circuit, achieving that white, emaciated, vulnerable look.My concern for Ms. Michael is that the look of breakable china may go deeper than art or artifice.John DannAmherst, Mass., Dec. 17, 2007The writer is a painter and sculptor. ● Gee whiz, the Gray Lady is getting frisky. The soul-searching regarding this issue stands in stark (sorry) contrast to the Mapplethorpe uproar several years ago.At that time, Cincinnati decided that his work would shock and offend the good citizens of Cincinnati. The Times scolded the Queen City for its provincial prudery, in articles and editorials. It's art, not porn, it proclaimed.Maybe yes, maybe no - either way, has The Times yet published even one of the ""offending"" photos? I haven't seen one.Yes, of course, there are certain standards and unwritten laws (mostly involving advertising revenue) that must be considered - or are there?Give us a break. The Times is way ahead of the field in bowdlerizing words and images, while preaching open-mindedness to the benighted citizenry. Lionel LibsonCamden, Me., Dec. 16, 2007 ● The bright line T magazine needs to find is not is not one that ""separates sexually charged images of men and women just short of 18 from art,"" as Jim Schachter, a deputy editor of the Magazine says, it is the bright line that separates pornography from child pornography. If the model is, or looks, under-age, The Times should do itself and the world a favor. Hire a grown-up. Then readers can decide for themselves whether it is too nasty to have in the house, and editors can decide whether it is too nasty to have in The New York Times.Kathleen A. PoolPortland, Ore., Dec. 16, 2007 ● The photographs are neither sexy nor tawdry. The model is indeed showing a lot of skin, but she is much too skinny.Yale RichmondWashington, Dec. 17, 2007 ● You are a brave man. In today's culture, you could be accused of censorship, prudery, proselytizing ... a whole host of rocks could be thrown your way. And probably will be. I hope you can duck.The quest for material gain should never intrude on values. Keep explaining this to Jim Schachter, Bill Keller and all those at The Times who don't seem to understand this.Bill FabrizioEast Atlantic Beach, N.Y., Dec. 17, 2007 ● Your column was much ado about nothing. After refreshing my memory with the pictures, I found the offending photo to be so indistinct as to be inoffensive and meaningless.The real issue was the exploitation of a minor in a semi-nude picture. This is the issue that you should have focused upon, not the poor-quality picture.Michael HermanNew York, Dec. 16, 2007 ● The Times risks losing its reputation by daring to see how far it can go in prurient appeal. If T magazine leads the way, can we expect its standards will show up in news sections? (News could serve up photos of the yearly naked run of students at Tufts, pictures of a bare breast at the Super Bowl halftime show.)If there are going to be double standards for sections of the paper, perhaps subscribers should be allowed to opt out of receiving T.S. E. SoderlindShort Hills, N.J., Dec. 16, 2007 ● I fear your column only stokes the fires of censorship by suggesting that art photography in The Times should be held to a different standard for good taste than that appearing in a specialist publication like V simply because The Times is sold to those who don't seek or expect to find such images in their daily newspaper.This notion perpetuates America's puritanical neurosis about the portrayal of the human form in any medium.While I found T's photos (and most fashion or lifestyle photography today) to be silly, incomprehensible and pointless, I have no objection to it being offered up to those readers and advertisers willing to pay the big bucks to keep The Times and the industry for luxury products afloat.It would be far more objectionable for The Times to censor creative people who are exploring the edge of good taste to avoid offending a moralistic minority. Those people have nothing better to do than tell everyone else how to live their lives, and they won't be satisfied no matter what you do.Whether the subject is fashion photography or news reportage, most thinking people can decide for themselves what content they want to see in their daily reading. P. Douglas FolkPhoenix, Dec. 16, 2007 ● The Holiday 2007 T magazine was very disturbing to me. After glancing through it and seeing the article with the young teenager, I was disconcerted by what I considered a step beyond art, pushing the images to a questionable level of good taste.Frankly, the entire issue left a stressed-out, overly commercial, lacking-in-substance impression. If I wished to read this type of magazine, I would buy it. Unfortunately, the past and present issue of T land in my waste basket often with but a glance.It is very revealing when the top editors have become inured to what that ""edge"" means to those of us who are not Seventh Avenue-hardened. The cult of the skinny anorexic models has gone too far. If you've ever known a young person who suffers this life-threatening state, it is neither attractive nor appealing.Ruth Mary PollackGuilford, Conn., Dec. 16, 2007 ● While neither tawdry or pornographic, as you say, the pictures you refer to probably startled quite a few readers, coming as they did in their Sunday morning paper.I do question the contention that content in T pushes limits that the regular paper does not. I recall seeing a photograph accompanying a review of the play ""Lulu"" in the Nov. 29 Arts pages. The picture was a highly sexualized young lady (probably not a teen, though, and I recognize that this likely changes the conversation), sitting with her legs spread around a seated man whose pants are around his ankles.I don't point this out to criticize any of the pictures I've seen in The Times. I am far more inclined to take umbrage at a smug-looking Dick Cheney on Page 1 than any mildly erotic image within separate sections of the paper. I only wish to demonstrate that this sort of eroticism may be more prevalent in your paper than you might think. Ralph W. SiddallDes Moines, Dec. 16, 2007 ● My children are children no longer. I am more liberal than most, with a particularly strong perspective on censorship, but it is neither the parent nor the political animal in me that is concerned to see these pictures in a Times publication.No matter how seriously editors make decisions when skating the edge of child pornography, they are already over the edge in my book.The Times's willingness to exploit this edge pushes me toward The Wall Street Journal. It's easier to sort out that publication's bias than to trust a company that would skim this edge. By sexualizing childhood for the sake of sales, The Times positions itself among a new batch of competitors.Longtime readers want The Times to move with the times, but this move reads as a sign that the Times may be morphing into something unrecognizable to this reader.Pamela MilesNew York, Dec. 16, 2007 ● I looked at the pictures on the Web site. Although, as Ali Michael's mother said, she may be ""very modest,"" her garb and poses cross my line of what we used to call decency.My mother always demanded of me and my siblings that we do nothing in public that we would not do at home. That's my line, and in my opinion, Ms. Michael crossed it.The Times should not have printed the pictures, regardless of the age of the model.Bill AbbottSaratoga, Calif., Dec. 17, 2007 ● That glossy magazine The Times throws at us 15 times a year is not part of the ""culture."" That's just an excuse to make more money for The Times.What happened to the wonderful magazine The Times used to give us at holiday time, showing New Yorkers and visitors the maps of the city and where each great holiday happening would be?Get back to basics and stop the stupid designer nonsense I throw in the garbage. And no more of these ""culture"" excuses.Estelle BrunoWest Sayville, N.Y., Dec. 16, 2007 ● Had I been a responsible editor asked to decide on those photographs, I would have nixed them. But not so much for the sexual suggestiveness as to avoid rewarding the physical child abuse of which they appear to be incontrovertible proof.As my wife instantly observed when I sought her opinion, that poor girl looks starved. The only visible curve on her is the profile of her breast. If she's not anorexic or bulemic, then she is suffering from something else that also needs urgent medical attention.Isn't the ""fashion"" industry belatedly recognizing this problem? Should The Times, or any newspaper, be part of the solution instead of the problem?Martin A. DyckmanWaynesville, N.C., Dec. 16, 2007 ● Those critics have too much time and too little do. Pornography is in the mind of the beholder. They must have filthy minds.Peter J. PeiranoRidgewood, N.J., Dec. 17, 2007●●Re ""If It's Fit to Blog, Is It Fit to Print?"" (Dec. 9):It may have been the correct decision to keep from the printed version of The Times the quote from the book by Scott McClellan, the former White House press secretary, that suggested President Bush had lied to him since Mr. McClellan had already said to Larry King on CNN that he didn't think Mr. Bush had knowingly pressed him to divulge false information.All the fuss over Mr. Bush seems to have eclipsed the fact that Mr. McClellan's statement also included Vice President Dick Cheney, Andrew Card, Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.They were not similarly excused by Mr. McClellan on ""Larry King Live."" How about mentioning that in the printed version of The New York Times? And how about a follow-up investigation of the fabulating four by Times reporters?James D. PoissonWakefield, R.I., Dec. 9, 2007 ● Your analysis of the excerpt from Scott McClellan's not-yet-released book about the leak that led to Scooter Libby's conviction raised compelling journalistic issues. But it glossed right over the substantive issue, arguing that the president may not have been one of the five who knew that Mr. McClellan was being asked to lie to the public and that therefore the leak story didn't go to print.Wouldn't the story of the president and his press secretary being lied to by Karl Rove, Scooter Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney and the president's own chief of staff be front-page news?Mary E. FellowsPortland, Ore., Dec. 10, 2007●I have written in before to complain about The Times Magazine's use of veryyoung-looking models. This may be the first actual breast, but spreadsfeaturing heavily made-up girls who look 12 or 14, sprawled in provocative,slutty poses are a standard feature of T ­ thumb through some back issues.I'm a Times subscriber in Tucson, and from here, obviously, the standardsof the New York fashion world (not to say the fashions themselves) arefairly incomprehensible. I take The Times to feel as if I know what'sreally going on, and despite some disappointments in the tone andindependence of the coverage, I love the paper and depend upon it. But thisold-hippie, staunchly anticensorship liberal is honestly shocked by theeditors' lack of attention to the demi-child-porn in some of your fashionlayouts.If the Times lets fashion photographers, under-age models and their stagemothers decide what's within the bounds of good taste, readers willcontinue to complain and editors will continue to have to explain howimages to delight pedophiles got into their newspaper.Renee DowningTucson, Dec. 16, 2007"

No player has been allowed to return to a game unless he is entirely without symptoms; has normal mental status testing; and has a normal neurological examination. Most recently any player who has loss of consciousness is not allowed to return to play regardless of symptoms, results of mental status testing or neurological examination. Medical staff and coaches continue to follow the player through the game and if the status of the player changes, he is removed. Players are expected and encouraged to report their symptoms, both on the day of the game and thereafter. However, in-game decisions are only one component of the process."

Alcoa said in April that it was considering shedding the units, which have felt a pinch from the same rising commodities prices that have driven profits in the aluminum giant's core operations. And amid massive consolidation within the industry, some analysts have said that overseas rivals with bulging coffers may take advantage of the weaker dollar and acquire the 119-year-old company. The sale may be aimed at warding off would-be buyers. The divisions generated about $3.2 billion in revenue last year, or 10 percent of Alcoa's overall revenues. They employ about 10,000 people in 22 countries. The Rank Group is the investment vehicle of Graeme Hart, one of New Zealand's richest businessmen.

The report said keeping Chamberlain in the bullpen for part of next season would help limit his innings in his first full year in the majors.

In tribute to President Emeritus Marshall, all flags have been lowered to half-staff. John D. Miller Chair, Board of Trustees Stuart Rabinowitz President Hofstra University MARSHALL--James Harper/d, born in New York City on July 21, 1931, died on December 16th after a sudden illness.

Only I can write them, knowing well that when finished, it can never be sufficient. Nothing could be. By necessity I must confine myself to a flyspeck perspective of a man with formidable combinations. By nature my father was affable, accommodating, an inveterate optimist -a ''Lebenskunstler''... how else could he have survived those twenty years, from the Great Depression until a few years after WWII, as a registered architect (in Florida, New York and Pennsylvania) with the U.S. building industry flat on its back? He was a man of cheerful humor, who delighted in his family, humanity, life ... and limericks. As a Pied Piper his limber-fingered magic tricks not only astounded children, they also taught them about physics. This music lover was a devotee of symphonic works, grand opera, operettas and was an accomplished pianist. My father was adroit with languages: English (adopted 1907 as his first language,) French, German (his mother tongue,) Latin, ancient Greek, and Nez Perce. An antiquity buff, he met every fortnight, eventually only once a month, with friends (Arnold Brecht, Irwin Edman, Ernest Fox, Gunter Keil, Theodore de Postels, etc.) to sight translate Latin and/or ancient Greek texts. Besides a multitude of other interests he was a devoted husband and a truly splendid parent. His modesty, polished manners, gallantry, unstinting time for his ''two girls'', is what my mother, Rosa Louise Frieling, nee Thollembeek (+ 04-12-02), and I missed most when he suddenly died of a massive heart attack fifty years ago.

2007-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Faced with a question, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton often begins her answers with a single word: ''Well.'' (As in, ''Well, I've spent 35 years of my life...'') It is hard to tell if it is a verbal tic, a one-syllable pause as she prepares a response, or a Midwesternism that has survived Wellesley, Yale, Arkansas, Washington and New York. Watching Mrs. Clinton's five-day swing across Iowa that has been called her ''likability tour,'' and trying to assess What It All Means for the Democratic presidential candidate, one answer comes easily to mind:"

2007-12-23T00:00:00Z,"IN 1928 my grandparents built a summer house in northwestern Connecticut, on a wooded hillside overlooking a small lake. Trees cluster closely about its dark rough clapboards and massive chimneys; a stone porch looks out toward the water. It's a refuge, knitted smoothly into the natural world around it. My grandparents left the house to their three children, and while I was growing up, my family always spent a summer month there. Now I own it, and my husband and I are putting in insulation, heat. We're changing little else: it's still the family house, still represents my grandparents, my mother."

2007-12-23T00:00:00Z,"THE NEWS The Federal Reserve proposed barring lenders from making subprime mortgage loans without verifying that borrowers can realistically afford to make the payments, in addition to imposing other checks on risky practices. BEHIND THE NEWS For years, the Fed was reluctant to rein in the dubious lending practices that fueled the housing boom, only to have its hand forced by the collapse of the subprime market this summer. The rules would restrict the use of ''no-doc'' loans, meant originally for self-employed people and others whose income was inconvenient to document. These loans came to be used to push through mortgages with onerous terms for people with little income."

His great fault may be that he is too trusting, and that he trusted all the wrong people with his team. The fall of the Falcons is complete, in less than two weeks. About as bad a day as Blank could imagine. Michael Vick, the quarterback he loved so much that he lavished a $130 million contract on him, made him the face of the franchise and pushed his wheelchair when he was injured -- is sentenced to 23 months in a federal prison.

2007-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Rogues Gallery: The recycled T-shirts that are at the core of the Rogues Gallery men's-wear line are sorted, processed, printed and reworked in a warehouse in Portland, Me., by a crew whose backgrounds have little to do with fashion. ''People who gravitate to the project don't really fit in at proper, standard organizations,'' says the Rogues designer, Alex Carleton, a former visual merchandiser for Ralph Lauren who left New York City in search of a heartier lifestyle. ''There's no superficiality, just kids who like to get dirty and listen to loud music and spill paint and dye shirts and make products.'' The Rogues aesthetic is an amalgamation of New England coastal life: the sludgy seascape, the local Slayer fans, Stephen King's American gothic (he was born in Portland) and the woodsy communal feasts Carleton holds in the backyard of his weathered fisherman's cottage. ''People talk about how men's wear is cleaning up,'' says Carleton, who will open the line's first store on the city's waterfront in February. ''Maybe in the urban bubble, but when you get away from that, guys are still grungy. That's interesting to me.'' Alabama Chanin ''I'm as proud of this system as I am of the designs,'' says Natalie Chanin, the woman behind Alabama Chanin, a line of richly embroidered recycled shirts and dresses that are cut, painted and sewn by hand in rural Florence, Ala. Her stitchers, some of whom quilted alongside her grandmothers, are part of a cottage-industry style of manufacturing in which people work out of their homes. ''These ladies can take care of parents or children, or have regular full-time jobs, and stitch in their spare time,'' she says. ''When I was in design school, I would never have told you in a million years that I would be busying myself with labor law,'' she adds. But it hit her that the clothes she envisioned were influenced by her past. ''And if I wanted to get these shirts sewn, the best thing to do would be to come home and find people who knew how to quilt.'' Chanin's headquarters are a pine-paneled office in a brick ranch house that she rents from her aunt; from its windows, she can see the house her grandfather built and where she grew up."

Krais, Sr. in 1954 and 1957, died Tuesday, December 11th at his home in Lighthouse Point, FL. He was 85 years old. The cause was congestive heart failure. Krais was born on December 2nd, 1922 in Mount Vernon, NY. He was the son of Frederick V. Krais, Sr., a founding member of the United States Lawn Tennis Umpires Association, and his wife Emily Baker Lovell Krais, a descendant of George F. Baker, who was the founder of the First National Bank of New York. Krais was raised in Pelham Manor, NY and began playing tennis at the Pelham Country Club. He won many tournaments as a Junior in both New York and New England, where his family maintained a summer home in Rockport, MA, including the New York State Championship in 1940. He also represented the United States in Junior Davis Cup Competition. Krais graduated from Hackley School in Tarrytown, NY and Fordham University in New York, where he was both Captain and MVP of their outstanding tennis team. He also competed in the National Championships at Forest Hills. Prior to graduating college, Krais served in the Fifth Army in Italy during WWII, for which he received four battle stars. When the war was over, he and Budge Patty paired to win the Mediterranean Doubles Championship, the precursor to the Italian Open which was played in Rome in 1945. After completing college in 1947, Krais spent a year in Florida playing tennis exhibitions, often organized by his cousin Jack March, a close friend of Fred Perry's and well known promoter of the sport, and played with such tennis greats as Donald Budge, Bobby Riggs and Alice Marble. He also won the Bermuda Championship at the Coral Beach Club in 1960. Krais then pursued a career in media sales, working for ABC Network and the Detroit News. He moved to Lighthouse Point, FL in 1983 and retired as President of Communications Publishers, Inc. in 1992. He was a 50 year member of the New York Athletic Club. He was also an active member of the First Presbyterian Church in Pompano Beach, FL, where he served as an Elder, a Stephen Minister and on the Council of the Presbytery of Tropical Florida. A descendant of Captain Benjamin Hallett, who served in the Revolutionary War, and the pilgrim John Howland, Krais was a member of the Sons of the American Revolution; the Society of Colonial Wars; the General Society of the War of 1812; and was serving as Governor of the Isaac Allerton Chapter of the Society of the Mayflower descendants in Palm Beach, FL at the time of his death. He is survived by his daughter, Christine Krais Schott, of Forest Hills Gardens, NY; two grandchildren, Whitney Lovell Schott and Meredith Baker Schott; and his companion of 35 years, Frances Perry Weigel, of Lighthouse Point, FL. His marriage to the former Janet McCarthy ended in divorce. A private graveside service was held on December 14th at the Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, NY, by the Reverend Jack Noble; with Military Honors provided by the Veteran Corps of Artillery in the state of New York, of which Krais was also a longtime member."

In Moscow, Marina Elzesser, the deputy director of the state-run Tretyakov Gallery, said that unless legislation was adopted by early January, it would be impossible to meet the planned Jan. 26 date for the exhibition, ''From Russia: French and Russian Master Paintings 1870-1925,'' at the Royal Academy of Art. The 120 works by French and Russian painters are now on view in Düsseldorf, Germany. ''There is little time,'' Ms. Elzesser said, adding that if the paintings returned to the four museums in Russia that lent them, they would be difficult to reassemble for a London exhibition. ''It's hardly possible,'' she said. Britain's government and the Royal Academy said on Friday that they expected the show to open on time after early passage of the legislative safeguard."

Her death followed an on-again, off-again battle with this cancer that began in 1978. In particular, the last three years of her life had been spent continuously fighting this cancer with only one lung, she remaining happy and active against all prediction, until it at last took her life at the mere age of 44. Despite her disease, she remained loving and supportive of her son, literally without fail, regardless of her own struggles. She is greatly missed by her son, Shane Austin Velazquesz, and those who knew her, who could always count on her compassion and understanding. ''Goodnight, sweet dreams, God bless you, I love you.''

Ending a quarter-century run, Mr. Bocca, 40, above, performed on an open-air stage on Avenido 9 de Julio, reprising classical roles, as well as samba, jazz and tango routines. Organizers estimated the crowd at 300,000 as Mr. Bocca, joined by Eleonora Cassano, his dance partner of 18 years, and accompanied by Mercedes Sosa, Diego Torres and others, fulfilled his plan to end his professional career after a yearlong farewell tour of 11 countries that began in January. ''You reach a certain age where it becomes a lot harder,'' he said in an interview with The Associated Press. At the end he donned a frayed robe from his days with American Ballet Theater as he hugged and kissed friends onstage.

It is hard to imagine a more challenging time for the candidates than the period from Dec. 26 through the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3. By every measure, many Iowans have not made a final decision about whom to support. So with all that campaign activity about to be packed into a superheated week, any small move -- a good speech or pithy put-down, a misstep or error by a supporter -- could have an outsized impact on the final outcome. If you want to find the candidates after Christmas Day, there really is only one place to look: Iowa. Even two Republicans who had until now made only token efforts in the state -- Rudolph W.

The terra-cotta statues of Vishnu, among the most revered Hindu deities, were stolen late on Sunday, said Ayub Quadri, Bangladesh's cultural affairs adviser. Mr. Quadri said the government was tightening controls along the border with India to prevent the statues, believed to be about 1,500 years old, from being smuggled out of the country. They were among 143 artifacts that Bangladesh had agreed to send to France for an exhibition at the Guimet Museum in Paris. Police detained 12 airport employees for questioning after the theft, including cargo handlers and airport security staff. Two of those detained were later released. The statues -- a bust and a full-length depiction of Vishnu -- were housed at the National Museum in Dhaka."

The original post also repeated a string of assertions by Bill White, the commander of the American National Socialist Workers Party, including the allegation that Paul meets regularly ""with members of the Stormfront set, American Renaissance, the Institute for Historic Review and others"" at a restaurant in Arlington, Va. Paul never attended these dinners, according to Benton, who also says that Paul has never knowingly met Bill White. Norman Singleton, a congressional aide in Paul's office, says that he met Bill White at a dinner gathering of conservatives several years ago, after which Singleton expressed his indignation at the views espoused by White to the organizer of the dinner.

2007-12-26T00:00:00Z,"As mixes go, the Barefoot Contessa's Homemade Marshmallow Mix makes more demands on a cook than most. A heavy-duty stand mixer is essential, unless you want to hold a portable electric mixer for 10 minutes or so. A candy thermometer, or some familiarity with the stages that sugar passes through as it boils, is also necessary. Most of the ingredients, like gelatin, sugar, salt and confectioners' sugar, are pantry staples that are on the ingredient list in most marshmallow recipes. But this package saves you the trouble of measuring to make nearly 100 cloudlike confections to float in your cocoa or to toast lightly -- they're less sturdy than the store-bought kind."

Their precarious, wandering existence demanded these traits, given that they had to tend to their sheep, camels and goats, as well having to protect their extended family and honored tribal rules. They lived in Sadu tents made out of camel wool, which the Bedouin women wove, and they survived on the livestock and the dairy products they carried with them."

2007-12-27T00:00:00Z,"DRESSLER--Fred M., A prominent and well-regarded executive in the cable industry, died on December 24, 2007, after several months of battling pancreatic cancer. He was 66. Recently retired as Executive Vice President of Programming at Time Warner Cable, Mr. Dressler first joined the cable TV business in 1976 and spent the next 30 years in various executive positions with Time Warner Cable and its predecessor company, American Television & Communications Corporation (ATC). In his early years in the business, he managed cable systems in Shreveport, LA, Fresno, CA and Denver, CO before rising through the executive ranks at the company's corporate offices. He had a reputation as a tough, but honest and fair negotiator with programming networks seeking distribution on cable, which earned him various sobriquets within the industry, including the dean of MSO programming executives. Many in the cable industry also regard Mr. Dressler as a mentor. When he retired at the end of 2006, Mr. Dressler was toasted at multiple industry gatherings and continued to consult and advise for a variety of media firms, including the BBC, Crown Media Holdings, MusicNet, Retirement Living TV, and Univision. According to Andy Heller, Turner Network Sales President of Domestic Distribution, ''Fred was quite simply a great teacher, mentor and friend. His continuous acts of selflessness have left their mark on me and countless others in the industry. He constantly thought about my personal and professional growth. He always gave me the tools and the opportunity to prove myself and then stepped back in the shadows, giving me the platform to shine on my own. I will continue to strive to be the same kind of mentor to others as he was to me.'' Mr. Dressler's stance on programming issues was often regarded as the blueprint which others in the cable business followed. One of the areas in which Mr. Dressler led the industry was on establishing a dedicated digital sports tier on cable for high-priced sports networks. He became one of cable's most vocal and consistent critics on the rising costs of sports rights. Negotiating opponents and colleagues seem to agree that Mr. Dressler simply loved the game. Mr. Dressler helped champion many of the new technologies that provided additional ways to serve up video content to consumers. He is credited with helping push Time Warner Cable faster into video-on-demand, personal video recorders and high-definition programming than other major cable operators. Many cable networks owe their creation, at least in part, to Mr. Dressler, who championed unique content and niche programming throughout his 20-year tenure heading up Time Warner Cable's programming operation. He was a founder of E! Entertainment, Sun Sports Network in Florida, SportsNet New York and the In-Demand Network. Mr. Dressler was also active at his alma mater, Syracuse University, where he graduated in 1963. He served as chairman of the advisory board of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. In May 2005, he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the school. On that occasion, New Yorker magazine writer Ken Auletta noted that ''Many of you are here tonight to honor Fred Dressler, and theres actually a good reason for it. The reason is fear. If you want to get on TV, be nice to this cable godfather.'' Prior to entering the cable business he also had a distinguished career in the newspaper, wire service, radio and television business ranging from writer, editor and on-air journalist to executive producer. It was during his early days covering Denver City Hall that Mr. Dressler got introduced to Bill Daniels, a legendary cable pioneer, which connected him up with ATC, the cable company that would later become Time Warner Cable. He was born and raised in New York City, the son of Martin and Anne Dressler. His father was in the advertising business and it was presumed he might follow that course. The news business, however, attracted his attention while still a student at Syracuse University. Mr. Dressler was an avid tennis player and devoted sports fan. At one point, soon after college, he tried out for the Philadelphia Phillies major league baseball team. Mr. Dressler is survived by his wife Patricia Armstrong Dressler, who produces educational programs through EduCable L.L.C. He is also survived by his parents, Anne and Martin Dressler of Marlboro, NJ; a sister, Susan Dressler of New York City; his son Douglas and daughter-in-law Terra of Denver; son Kevin and daughter-inlaw Courtney, also of Denver; and three grandchildren: Lauren, six, Katharine, two and Hailey, one. The family asked that friends and family wishing to make donations on his behalf direct their contributions to Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School, the Smilow Cancer Hospital, which will be part of the YaleNew Haven Hospital complex, or the American Cancer Society. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service for friends and family will be announced at a later time."

The group's members -- Romero Lubambo on guitar, Nilson Matta on bass and Duduka Da Fonseca on drums -- bring high spirits and spring-heeled grace to the prospect of samba jazz. (The hybrid term is theirs.) In performance, even more strikingly than on a handful of winsome albums, they deliver the sort of virtuoso intensity that lights up the best bebop. If the playing weren't so thoughtful and so seemingly effortless, it might even be too much. Each musician in the band has made his mark on the New York jazz scene as a sideman and a leader. Mr. Da Fonseca has a brisk and rewarding album called ''Samba Jazz in Black & White'' (Zoho), and Mr. Matta recently released a guest-laden showcase, ''Walking With My Bass'' (Blue Toucan). Mr. Lubambo, one of the most dynamic nylon-string guitarists working anywhere in the vicinity of jazz, has done especially fine work with vocalists, including Luciana Souza and Dianne Reeves. (He figures prominently on Ms. Souza's exquisite ''Brazilian Duos'' and its equally fine sequel, both on Sunnyside.)"

2007-12-28T00:00:00Z,"'NORVAL MORRISSEAU: SHAMAN ARTIST' Using watercolor and ink on slabs of birch bark or buffalo hide, and later acrylic paint on paper and canvas, the Anishinaabe Indian artist Norval Morrisseau, from Canada, produced some of the most original contemporary Indian art of the 20th century. The retrospective at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian is a handy reminder of the genius of Mr. Morrisseau, who died earlier this month. (He was thought to be 75.) More than 50 paintings and drawings spanning his career have been assembled by Greg A. Hill, a curator at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa. One highlight is the monumental, six-panel ''Man Changing Into Thunderbird'' (1977), a colorful narrative painting referencing spiritual transformation, creation stories, shamanistic practices and a pantheon of religious figures, cultural heroes and celebrated ancestors. Linear and graphic imagery of animals, plants and spirits dominates the rest of the work in the show, but rarely are the paintings repetitive or formulaic. (''Shaman Rider,'' 1972, is above.) Their great appeal partly derives from Mr. Morrisseau's marrying of an understanding of Indian spirituality with his own formal ambitions as a painter.

2007-12-28T00:00:00Z,"'CUT TO THE CHASE' At the start of Parallel Exit's latest production, you may be reminded of ''Let's Make a Deal.'' Three closed doors face the audience with enigmatic promise. But while the shows have other similarities -- crazy costumes, squealing and placards held aloft -- no one is asked to make a fateful choice among doors. At the end of this hour everyone goes home a winner. The doors, slammed open and shut, are the shifting gears in a comedy that's largely wordless (except for a few songs). Inspired, as are all the company's works, by the films of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, this vaudeville is actually about vaudeville. It presents a ragtag troupe: Dilly (Laura Dillman, above), a diminutive usher; Dobson (Mike Dobson), a percussionist; the Great Jeske (Joel Jeske, above), impresario and M.C.; Julietta Massina (Juliet Jeske, married to Mr. Jeske), the singing diva; Kasper (Ryan Kasprzak), a gentle buffoon; Little Angela (Andrea Kehler), an overgrown Shirley Temple; and Roland Derek (Derek Roland), a suave magician. The similarity between the characters' names and the actors' makes you suspect that the performers have a certain cozy closeness with their fictional personalities."

At 11 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday at Symphony Space, ''Ugly Duckling and Me,'' recommended for ages 6 to 12, offers an animated reinterpretation of ''The Ugly Duckling,'' starring a sleazy talent agent named Ratso (a rat), who adopts an odd-looking egg that hatches to become you know who. At 2 p.m. on both days Symphony Space will also present ''Viva Cuba!,'' a haunting tale, in Spanish with English subtitles, about a boy and a girl, about 10 or 11, who run away in an attempt to prevent the girl's mother from taking her out of the country and destroying their friendship. On Saturday and Sunday at 11 a.m. at the IFC Center, children 3 to 8 can enjoy ''Kid Flix Mix 2,'' a program of 12 shorts, including Bill Plympton's ''Fan and the Flower,'' an unusual animated love story, and Sheldon Cohen's ''I Want a Dog,'' whose title explains it all. Symphony Space programs are at the Leonard Nimoy Thalia, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street; $10; $8 for children; $6 for members.

Balletomanes can happily exist on a diet of toe shoes and tulle for two months, but the rest of the dancegoing population will want to pick and choose. A Feb. 10 farewell for the divine principal dancer Nikolaj Hubbe, retiring from the stage to lead the Royal Danish Ballet, should top your to-do list, along with a new ballet by Christopher Wheeldon, the resident choreographer. Having its premiere on Feb. 7, it will be Mr. Wheeldon's last for City Ballet before he leaves to lead his new company, Morphoses. Balanchine classics like ''Serenade'' and ''Mozartiana'' should not be missed, nor should Wheeldon gems like ''Liturgy'' and ''Carousel (A Dance).'' Of course you could tackle the season week by week, as casting is announced. This week the radiant Ashley Bouder, above, will almost certainly shine in the ''Emeralds'' section of Balanchine's ''Jewels.'' She will also perform in Jerome Robbins's ''Brandenburg'' (1997), along with the principal dancer Gonzalo Garcia, an exciting new import from the San Francisco Ballet, in a role debut. Another Robbins ballet, ''The Concert,'' also features a host of debuts. Finally the retired City Ballet star Jock Soto will make a rare guest appearance, as Lord Capulet in Peter Martins's ''Romeo and Juliet''; but keep your eye on another star, a rising one: Robert Fairchild, a young and dashing Romeo.

2007-12-28T00:00:00Z,"'CITY LIGHTS' Talking pictures were old news by 1931, when Charlie Chaplin released ''City Lights,'' a ''comedy-romance in pantomime'' that he had begun filming when silents still reigned. Chaplin, one of the few stars who could afford to ignore the talkie revolution, was understandably reluctant to give up the form. After all, in his hands silent comedy had become something like a universal language, and it had brought him an almost unprecedented fame. Technically ''City Lights'' -- showing at Film Forum in a new 35-millimeter print in honor of the 30th anniversary of Chaplin's death -- isn't a silent film. A jack of all cinematic trades, Chaplin (who also directed) composed the buoyant score, and he deploys sound effects as another weapon in his comic arsenal. A politician's words come out as kazoo squawks; Chaplin's Tramp swallows a whistle, making a case of the hiccups a symphony of squeaks."

2007-12-29T19:40:24Z,"The Washington Redskins can earn a playoff berth by beating the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. But like several other matchups on the final day of the regular season, the outcome will hinge as much on who does not play as on who does.The Cowboys (13-2) clinched home field in the National Football Conference playoffs last Sunday. They have little to gain by going all out against Washington (8-7) and will probably limit the risk to injured players like Tony Romo (thumb).One player who will not be taking part is Terrell Owens, who sustained a high ankle sprain last week. Owens scored all four touchdowns in the Cowboys' Week 11 victory against the Redskins (highlights here), taking advantage of a secondary weakened by the absence of safety Sean Taylor. Taylor, who missed the game with a knee injury, was shot and killed a week later. His death, and a season-ending injury to quarterback Jason Campbell, might have led the Redskins to pack it in.Instead, they won three in a row. Now, buoyed by the steady play of Todd Collins, who has not thrown an interception, and Clinton Portis, who has 376 yards from scrimmage in the last three games, the Redskins control their playoff destiny.""I don't know of a team - I haven't been a part of one - that's overcome this much,"" Coach Joe Gibbs told reporters.

Hitchcock called it his favorite film; critics said it was his best. Gordon McDonnell earned an Oscar nomination for best original story, and none other than Thorton Wilder wrote the screenplay. Hitchcock had wanted Joan Fontaine for the role of Charlie but couldn't get her, so he settled on Wright, who had understudied the role of Emily in Wilder's ''Our Town'' on Broadway.

BEHIND THE NEWS An extremely tight race among Hillary Rodham Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards put the focus on the many likely caucusgoers who were undecided. Mrs. Clinton said she alone had the necessary experience and was ''ready to be president on Day 1.'' Mr. Obama portrayed himself as an avatar of change and urged voters not to ''get caught up in the same old nonsense that has come to pass as politics.'' Mr. Edwards promised to take on special interests, warning: ''Corporate greed is killing the middle class.''"

Born in New York City in 1915, he graduated Magna Cum Laude from Harvard in 1936. In 1939, he married Janet Man in a ceremony conducted by then mayor Fiorello LaGuardia and then joined his father in the construction business, known as M. Shapiro & Sons, building homes and apartments from New England to Kansas, housing 150,000 people in fifteen states. At the end of a decade in business, he published his first novel, The Last Temptation, which was a New York Times bestseller and a main selection of the Literary Guild. During the succeeding thirty years he built M. Shapiro and Sons into Presidential Realty Corporation, a multi-faceted publicly traded real estate company, serving at various times as Chairman of its Finance Committee, its Executive Committee and as President. In that period, he produced three more major novels, To Love and Corrupt (1962), Monkey on a String (1968), and Life Lines (1982); each was a selection of a major book club. He also found time to sit on the boards of many other corporations, and was a leader of the Human Rights Commission in Stamford, Connecticut during the most intense period of the civil rights struggles in the 1960s. For many years he lived in Stamford and St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where his wife was an underwater photographer. In 1992, Janet Viertel died after 54 years of marriage.

Will they be 2008 and 2009, or 2007 and 2008?"

2007-12-30T00:00:00Z,"WINE enthusiasts love to discuss the aromas of wine -- the raspberries, the leather, the fresh-cut grass -- but are we ignoring a prevailing whiff of petroleum? With some wines emitting three times their weight in greenhouse gas, the answer is yes. Wine, like virtually every consumer product, has a ''carbon footprint'' -- that is, a certain amount of carbon dioxide is emitted in its production and transportation. And although the difference between organically and conventionally grown vineyards is relatively small in terms of carbon intensity, the journey that wine takes from the winery to the shop is not. Indeed if your New Year's resolution for 2008 is to reduce your carbon footprint, don't serve wine from California at your New Year's Eve party. Instead, try wines from the tri-state region."

2007-12-31T16:55:58Z,"As I was recently reminded, there is no day of the year better for flying than Christmas Day. The roads are relatively clear, even in Los Angeles, and the planes are seldom full. Those unfortunates on duty in the airport and the skies join with those eccentrics who choose to take to the air in place of family festivities and make the terminal itself, the jet, a site for celebration. One year, on Christmas Day, a British Airways gate agent gave me, and even the friend who came to see me off, a free pass to the First Class lounge and an invitation to go wild. Few immigrations officers or security personnel (other than sniffer dogs) want to be cast as Scrooge, and gifts acquire a special meaning when they come from strangers."

2007-12-31T14:39:44Z,"Barack Obama has always excited big Labor and other Democratic constituencies, even if they weren't necessarily ready to endorse him for the presidency. Now, though, as Mr. Obama goes all out to undermine a surging John Edwards in the final days before the Iowa caucuses, that cordial relationship is being put to the test. Mr. Obama has essentially charged that Mr. Edwards is a hypocrite because, while Mr. Edwards has said he favors banning unregulated campaign money from outside groups, his campaign is getting millions of dollars worth of assistance from outside contributors - namely unions. What's remarkable about this line of attack is that, while Mr. Obama is aiming squarely at Mr. Edwards, he also risks alienating some of the most powerful interest groups in Democratic Washington. In case you haven't been paying attention, here's what's going on: several state chapters of the mighty Service Employees International Union have endorsed Mr. Edwards and set up an independent entity - the kind of so-called 527 that Edwards himself has decried in the past - to run ads on his behalf. They even hired his 2004 campaign manager, Nick Baldick, to oversee the operation. (The state and municipal workers union and Emily's List are also in Iowa, dropping a lot of cash in support of Hillary Clinton.) Mr. Obama, the only one of the three leading candidates who hasn't received a big union endorsement, has repeatedly called on Mr. Edwards to ask his labor friends to stand down. Mr. Edwards has responded by saying that he still opposes such groups in theory, but that he isn't involved in the union effort and is powerless to control it."

The children of Brown, the soul singer, were largely excluded from the financial part of the will, which left the bulk of Brown’s money to trusts to educate his grandchildren and needy youngsters.

Most of Brown’s estate, including his home in Beech Island, S.C., and rights to his image, name and music, would go to the James Brown “I Feel Good” Trust for the education of needy children in South Carolina and Georgia, as well as to a family trust to educate Brown’s grandchildren younger than 35.

2008-01-01T00:00:00Z,"MEYER--Leonard B., composer, author, philosopher and esteemed and honored humanities professor died on December 30, 2007. He was 89. He contributed major works in the fields of aesthetic theory in music, and compositional analysis and was one of the first to explore the relationship between Game Theory and musical composition. His books include Emotion and Meaning in Music, The Rhythmic Structure of Music (with Grosvenor Cooper), Some Remarks on Value and Greatness in Music, Style and Music: Theory History and Ideology (General Editor), The Spheres of Music : A Gathering of Essays, as well as numerous articles and other scholarly works. His writings address such diverse subjects as musical emotion, the psychology of music, musical analysis and theory, aesthetics, information theory, the anthropology of art, and art and neuroscience. Meyer studied at Bard College, Columbia University (B.A. in Philosophy, M.A. in Music) and the University of Chicago (Ph.D. in History of Culture). As a composer, he studied under Stefan Wolpe and Aaron Copland. He taught at the University of Chicago for 29 years.

2008-01-01T00:00:00Z,"British legislation took effect on Monday to safeguard a pending London exhibition of art on loan from four Russian museums against possible lawsuits claiming ownership of the paintings, The Associated Press reported. Russian authorities had threatened to scuttle the show, ''From Russia: French and Russian Master Paintings, 1870-1925, From Moscow and St. Petersburg,'' scheduled to begin on Jan. 26 at the Royal Academy of Arts, unless they were assured the works were protected from seizure to satisfy possible claims that some of the 120 paintings had been confiscated by the state after the 1917 revolution. But moving up the date of the legislation, previously scheduled to take effect in February, appeared to satisfy Russian concerns. Anatoly Vilkov, deputy director of Rosokhrankultura, the Russian cultural heritage watchdog, said, ''I can say that with the early adoption of this law, our federal agency will grant permission for the temporary export of these paintings.'' Mikhail Kamynin, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, told the Itar-Tass news agency that officials must still study details of the law but called it ''a step in the right direction.''"

2008-01-01T00:00:00Z,"Vandals did substantial damage to the farm where Robert Frost summered from 1939 to 1963, The Associated Press reported. The destruction at Homer Noble Farm, above, a national historic landmark, on a dead-end road in Ripton, Vt., was apparently inflicted during an underage drinking party attended by as many as 50 people, said a police sergeant, Lee Hodsden. After breaking a window to gain entry, the intruders demolished tables, chairs, pictures, light fixtures and dishes. They smashed wicker furniture and dressers and burned them in a fireplace, presumably to warm the unheated structure. Sergeant Hodsden said empty beer bottles and cans and cellophane believed to have been used to hold marijuana were also found; two fire extinguishers were also set off inside. He said no arrests had been made, although the police have tracked down some partygoers. The damage was discovered on Saturday by a hiker who notified the police at Middlebury College, which maintains the site.

2008-01-01T00:00:00Z,"SCHULER--Robert Charles. President of Celebrity International, Inc. A Personal Memorial from his wife, Metropolitan Opera star, Patrice Munsel Schuler, his children and grandchildren. My husband, Robert Charles Schuler, was the handsomest -funniest -most adventurous man I have ever known. He was a great business man, a fabulous father to our four children, Heidi, Rhett, Scott and Nicole, and grandfather to two wonderful grandsons, Stefan and Aleksander, all of whom have inherited his great sense of humor and adventurous spirit. His friends, both famous and infamous, were friends for life. Bob attended Cotter Prep, St. Mary's College, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and was a proud member of the Alpha Tau Omega (Gamma Nu Chapter) fraternity. He studied at Max Reinhardts Theater School, and with Lee Strassberg at the American Theatre Wing. His first job was as an advertising copy writer at Sears Roebuck in Chicago. Hating the cold in the Windy City, he told his boss he was leaving, and that same day drove to California, where he settled in the Colony at Malibu, and founded the Malibu Theatre. He played bit parts in movies (''The Canterbury Ghost'' was one of them) for MGM, Columbia, and Universal Studios, became assistant Advertising Manager of Western Airlines, was Associate Producer of the Broadway play, ''Laura'', and conceived and was Executive Producer of ''The Patrice Munsel Show'' on the ABC-TV Network in the 1950's. At the Young & Rubicam Advertising Agency in Manhattan, he was a Director and TV Casting Director. For 15 years, before his retirement, he was President of the prestigious Public Relations firm, Celebrity International, Inc. in New York City. A superb writer, he freelanced for ''Details'' Magazine, submitted numerous pieces for high profile clients in the society columns, and he wrote eight travel books called, ''The Little Book: Dare to Do It Yourself'' series. One of his proudest accomplishments is the wonderful book he wrote about our crazy and wonderful 55 years of life together entitled, ''The Diva And I''. Our Dad's enthusiasm for childlike excitement led us on a lot of wonderful adventures together, some exotic, some cheap fun...all zany! He gave us a love of skiing, snorkeling, exploringand excitement for Life! He was a big bear that taught us to love, be compassionate, honest and kind. We love him for that. Our grandfather, ''Big Dado'' was one of the greatest and most influential men in our lives. If we could be half the man that he was, we'll have lived a very full and meaningful life. He showed us the world with new eyes. At noon on Christmas day 2007, in the snow covered Adirondack Mountains, at his home, Robert Charles Schuler, born in Winona Minnesota, left on his greatest adventure. He is survived by his wife, Patrice Munsel Schuler, his children, Heidi Schuler Bright, Scott Schuler, Nicole Schuler, and his grandsons, Stefan Kocev and Aleksander Kocev. His son Rhett Schuler died in 2005. He is also survived by a brother, William Schuler, and a sister, Mary Lou Safranek. For my husband and our father and grandfather, Life was a big box of chocolates. Robert Charles Schuler 1917-2007. We Love You!"

These anthropologists' beef with Mr. Diamond clearly has less to do with the content of his thesis than with the fact that he tries to understand why things happen rather than writing a morality play conforming to their lefter-than-thou politics."

Founding partner at the advertising firm of Avrett, Free and Ginsburg, Mrs. Free was well respected and acknowledged as one of the industry's leading copywriters. A pioneer for women in the advertising business she was the first female Creative Director at N.W. Ayer in Philadelphia in the 1940's. With her former husband, William Free, she created memorable campaigns for companies such as Nescafe, Coca Cola, Purina, National Airlines, Pfizer and Gillette, to name but a few. She received several Clio awards for her creative work. She once advised her daughter that the only way for a woman to have a lifelong career in the advertising business was to have her name on the door. Following her retirement to her beloved home in Watermill, New York, she devoted herself to her garden, entertaining and a variety of local environmental and animal rights causes. In her last few years, she completed a memoir entitled ''Somewhere Warm'' of her time spent in post war Europe, writing and painting with fellow ex-pats. She is fondly remembered for her sharp wit, her enduring attachment to her manual typewriter, her loyalty to her small circle of friends, and her determination to master the only thing that ever eluded her -fluency in the Italian language.

He was born in Budapest, Hungary on January 7, 1937 as George Gottlieb. At the age of six he survived the Holocaust, fleeing Budapest with his mother and living in hiding for two years. He returned to Budapest after the war, but by age 19 he was no longer willing to tolerate living within the oppressive Communist regime. He escaped the city by foot in late November 1956, one day after planned (he overslept). On the way out of Hungary, he evaded gunfire, slept in a barn and waded through a small freezing river. After reaching Austria, he was chosen to serve as the leader and spokesperson for a group of Hungarian students being housed by an Austrian Count. Although he had the opportunity for relatively easy passage to a variety of countries, he was determined to get to the United States and specifically to New York City. He arrived in New York Harbor in February 1957 on a U.S. Navy transport ship with no money and no knowledge of English, but an uncompromising determination to build a home and embrace life in a place that protects and celebrates individual freedom. He went to Columbia on a scholarship, where he studied engineering and economics. He began a career in advertising and media working for ad agencies and then directly for a client. Ultimately he moved into media sales, working at WPIX, Fox 5 and NBC's PAX Television, building a sales career that spanned more then 35 years, thousands of avails and many, many lunches. In 1974, he married Chickie Bucco, whom he adored (a fact that aggravated him to no end). He was the proud father of Andrew and loving father-in-law to Erin. He was a passionate and talented chef and wine connoisseur. He also loved renovating his country house, gardening, Giants, Rangers and Yankees games, bragging about his son, and, maybe most of all, entertaining and celebrating life with family and friends. In addition to Chickie, Andrew and Erin, George is survived by his Aunt Giselle, cousins of Hungary, and the entire Bucco family.

2008-01-01T00:00:00Z,"CLERY--Howard K., Jr. (1930 -2008) Security On Campus, Inc. co-founder and former CEO of Rapidforms, Inc. died peacefully at his Florida home January 1st , age 77. He was the loving husband of Constance B. Clery for 51 years and the father of three adoring children: Howard III, Benjamin, and Jeanne. A man of great character, Howard never allowed adversity to defeat him: his many accomplishments, family and friends who love him dearly are testament to the life of a good man. May all who love him find comfort in their memories of Howard. In 1991, Dartmouth Alumni awarded Howard Clery the Class of 1953 Award commenting: ...our brightest young people, our best hope for the future of this great nation are safer and more secure because of him. Howard and Connie cofounded Security On Campus, Inc. following the brutal murder of their daughter on Lehigh Universitys campus in 1986. After the 1987 conviction of their daughters murderer, Howard and Connie devoted their lives to making college and university campuses safer places for students. They secured passage of more than 30 State and Federal Laws requiring colleges to disclose crime information and guarantee victims rights, including the Federal Jeanne Clery Act which is named in memory of their daughter. President George H. Bush honored the Clerys for their crime victims rights work in a 1990 Rose Garden ceremony, noting: their campaign to build an America where every victim of every crime is treated with the dignity and the compassion they deserve. As CEO of Rapidforms, Howard successfully built a regional printer of labels, business forms and stationery into a national direct mail company, growing the business from 25 employees and $2 million in sales (1971) to 280 employees and $40 million in sales (1987). Howard was always quick to credit his association with CSS Industries, executive colleagues and the employees of Rapidforms for the companys accomplishments. Prior to his business success at Rapidforms, Howard held executive positions at Safeguard Industries, Raytheon, and Royal McBee, beginning his career as Gillette Company's first management trainee. Howard was educated at Dartmouth College, earning a B.A. Degree in 1953 and an MBA in 1954 from the Amos Tuck Graduate School of Business Administration. He was elected Vice President of his freshman class, President of his sophomore class, and Vice President of the Student Council during his senior year. Howards years at Dartmouth not only provided an excellent education, it was the formative place where he made life-long friendships which he cherished throughout his life. Life presented many difficult challenges for Howard Clery. Born in Boston, Howards father died in 1941 when he was 11 years old. He became a very competitive athlete at Arlington High School playing varsity football when he was stricken with polio during practice in 1945. Despite a year of rehabilitation at Warm Springs, GA. he would wear a heavy steel leg brace and walk on canes for the remainder of his life. The family will receive visitors from 7:00pm to 9:00pm on Monday, January 7th at McConaghy Funeral Home, 328 West Lancaster Avenue, Ardmore, PA. A funeral mass will be held at 10am on Tuesday, January 8th in the St. Thomas of Villanova Church University Campus, Villanova, PA.

2008-01-02T22:14:04Z,"With Ohio State and Louisiana State having arrived in New Orleans, now is the time to look at 10 story lines worth following heading into the Bowl Championship Series title game Monday.1. The Hat vs. the Vest - L.S.U. Coach Les Miles is nicknamed the Hat because of the stiff brim he wears during games. Ohio State Coach Jim Tressel is known as the Vest because of his typical game-day sweater vest. Miles has become the known as the consummate sideline gambler, and Tressel is usually as conservative as his attire. But few will gives Miles the strategic edge here because Tressel has won too many big games by close margins.2. The Speed Factor - After Florida, like L.S.U. a team in the Southeastern Conference, routed Ohio State in last season's title game, team speed was cited as a strong factor. That came into play especially with the Gators' defensive front seven. Expect the speed factor as an advantage for L.S.U. to be discussed excessively leading up to the game.3. The Imperfect Quarterback - Plenty of observers are going to say that this Ohio State team is better than last season's. Well, it's not. The disparity at quarterback is enough of a reason, as the Buckeyes traded the Heisman Trophy winner, Troy Smith, for the immobile and not-so-accurate Todd Boeckman. L.S.U. has the solid-but-unspectacular Matt Flynn, which means that whichever quarterback makes the least mistakes will probably win."

The latest sniping on the blogs centered Mr. Obama's suggestion that Democrats needed to nominate someone whom half the country wouldn't immediately reject, which, according to Mr. Obama, is what they did in 2000 and again in 2004. This comment wasn't significantly different from the electability argument that most of the Democrats have made at one time or another, but Mr. Obama's specific reference to Al Gore and John Kerry was enough to renew dubious allegations that Mr. Obama was, once again, sounding more like a Republican than a Democrat."

His writings address such diverse subjects as musical emotion, the psychology of music, musical analysis and theory, aesthetics, information theory, the anthropology of art, and art and neuroscience. Meyer studied at Bard College, Columbia University (B.A. in Philosophy, M.A. in Music) and the University of Chicago (Ph.D. in History of Culture). As a composer, he studied under Stefan Wolpe and Aaron Copland. He taught at the University of Chicago for 29 years. He was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University, a Guggensheim Fellow and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1975, he was named Benjamin Franklin Professor of Music and Humanities at the University of Pennsylvania. He was beloved by generations of music and humanities students. Born in New York City, Professor Meyer lived a full life devoted to his family, his students, colleagues, and the humanities. During World War II, he fought with the front line infantry at the Ardennes and the Battle of the Bulge. A great wit, Meyer regaled friends and family with recitations from Gilbert & Sullivan and Shakespeare, and frequent puns. He asked that his tombstone be engraved with the musical pun in Hamlet's dying words: The rest is silence. He will be deeply missed by his loving daughters, Muffie (Ronald Blumer), Carlin (Peter Bienstock) and Erica (Potter Palmer), granddaughters, Emma and Molly, his first wife and mother of his children, Lee Meyer of Chicago, his sister-in-law Karen Levy and his care givers, Pauline Whitehill, Sandra Jones and Brigid Nicholson. He was pre-deceased by his second wife, Janet Levy, and his brother, Daniel Meyer, and sister, Carolyn Meyer. There will be a memorial service at Riverside Memorial, 76th and Amsterdam, on January 13th at 2:00pm. Donations in lieu of flowers: NY Gilbert & Sullivan Players or American Musicological Society."

Five of Brown's heirs are trying to have his will voided, contending that his advisers, seeking to profit, used undue influence to create charitable trusts. At stake, besides the money from his estate, are an album Brown recorded the summer before his death and 50 to 60 other unreleased songs, said Mr. Dallas, who quit as an estate trustee in November but is trying to be reinstated. ...It's a different sound, but while you're waiting, you may want to consider the country album that Billboard says Jessica Simpson is in the early stages of recording in Nashville for release this year by Columbia Records.

2008-01-02T00:00:00Z,"DUSENBERRY--Phil, 71, died Saturday, December 29 of advanced lung cancer for which he was treated over the past year. Former Chairman of the advertising agency BBDO North America, Phil helped create what many observers consider the most creative network in the world. From theme lines like GE's ''We bring good things to life,'' to Pepsi's ''The choice of a new generation,'' Phil created advertising that truly touched the heart. He pioneered the effective use of celebrities as participants, not just pitchmen. His work for Pepsi featured celebrities like Michael Jackson, Michael J. Fox and Madonna, and his long list of awards includes ADDYs, Clios, One Show Pencils, and Gold Lions at Cannes. In recognition of a lifetime of creative achievement, Phil was inducted into the American Advertising Federation Hall of Fame in 2003 and The One Club Creative Hall of Fame in October 2007. Raised in Brooklyn, the son of a cab driver, Phil graduated from Midwood High School. He attended Emory & Henry College in Virginia on an athletic scholarship but left when the athletic program was cancelled. After that, he was mostly and very effectively self-taught. He joined BBDO New York as a copywriter in 1962 and rose to become the agency's Chief Creative Officer, then Chairman and CEO, and finally Chairman of BBDO North America. Under Phil's leadership, BBDO was named ''Agency of the Year'' on four different occasions by the leading industry publications, and the agency enjoyed unprecedented growth with the addition of such renowned brands as FedEx, HBO, Pizza Hut and Cingular, to name a few. ''The work, the work, the work'' became the agency's mantra. Phil's contributions to public service were many and varied. He spearheaded the team that worked with Mayor Giuliani to develop the ''New York Miracle'' campaign, raising New York City's spirits following 9/11. He led the Ad Council's Freedom Corps effort urging volunteerism as well as the Council's more recent ''Don't Almost Give'' public service messages that ran this year. He was Chairman of the 4A's and served on the Boards of the New York Coalition for the Homeless, the Silver Shield Foundation of New York and the Twin Towers Fund. Phil was also a member of the ''Tuesday Team'' that helped reelect Ronald Reagan in 1984. His filmed tribute, ''Final Journey,'' subsequently became a permanent part of the Reagan Presidential Library. A lifelong baseball and die-hard Yankee fan, he cowrote the screenplay for the Robert Redford movie, ''The Natural.'' His philosophy towards business and advertising is best summed up by the title of his 2005 memoir, ''One Great Insight Is Worth a Thousand Good Ideas.'' Phil lived in Manhattan, Sag Harbor, NY and St. Thomas, VI. He was a member of the East Hampton Golf Club and Blind Brook Country Club in Westchester, and an active member of St. Andrew's R.C. Church in Sag Harbor. This September, he received the St. Agnes Medal of Service from the Diocese of Rockville Centre. He is survived by his wife, Susan; his stepson, Ben Procter; a daughter-inlaw, Ilana Sparrow; a brother Harry and wife Marcy; a brother Joseph; a sister Jean Driscoll and husband Jack; and a large extended family. A wake will be held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street in Manhattan on Thursday evening, January 3rd, from 7pm to 9pm, and Friday, January 4th, from 2pm to 4pm and 7pm to 9pm. A Funeral Mass will be held on Saturday, January 5th at 1pm at St. Ignatius Loyola at 980 Park Avenue at 84th Street in Manhattan. A graveside service will take place on Sunday, January 6th at 11am at Oakland Cemetery in Sag Harbor. Donations may be made in Phil's name to: Coalition for the Homeless, 129 Fulton Street, New York, NY 10038 or St. Jude Children's Cancer Research Hospital, 501 St. Jude Place, Memphis, TN 38105."
2008-01-02T00:00:00Z,"JOHNSON--Ron, died Sunday, December 30th in his home in Upper Nyack, NY at 49 years old. He leaves behind his wife, Jacqueline Pack-Johnson, and his son, Matthew Pack. He was the son of Irene Ware and the late Fred Ware. Ron was born and raised in Mobile, AL. He graduated with a degree in Business Administration from Georgia State University and began a career in banking in Atlanta, GA. In 1989 he left his position as Vice President of Special Assets Group for First Union Corporation of Georgia to begin his career in the record industry.

In April 2007 he left his position as Executive Vice President of Atlantic Records to join Capitol Music Group as Executive Vice President and head of Urban Music.

He faced his condition head on without fear. He was an avid runner and was training for his first marathon. Ron loved his family, turkey burgers and Guinness beer, Porsche sports cars, playing golf, and his dog Lucy.

Bill Brink writes in this week's Play newsletter. ""Is it as simple as a decree from 'SportsCenter' or should the standard be higher -- say, like transforming the very way the game is played?

Even though he has been dead for almost 20 years, Fornasetti's studio, now under the supervision of his son Barnaba, keeps churning out products based on his designs. The latest product: rugs. While the elder Fornasetti did not produce rugs during his prolific career, his son claims that is only because ''life is short.'' Mr. Fornasetti, together with Sam Roubini of Roubini Rugs, chose 25 designs from the Fornasetti archive (which is thought to contain more than 11,000 designs) to produce a collection of hand-knotted wool and silk rugs ($2,900 to $24,600). Asked about his favorites, Mr. Fornasetti replied ''the fish, the courtyard, the ribbon with objects and the snake.'' Roubini Rugs, 200 Lexington (32nd Street), (212) 696-4648 or www.roubinirugs.com.

2008-01-03T00:00:00Z,"DUSENBERRY--Phil, 71, died Saturday, December 29 of advanced lung cancer for which he was treated over the past year. Former Chairman of the advertising agency BBDO North America, Phil helped create what many observers consider the most creative network in the world. From theme lines like GE's ''We bring good things to life,'' to Pepsi's ''The choice of a new generation,'' Phil created advertising that truly touched the heart. He pioneered the effective use of celebrities as participants, not just pitchmen. His work for Pepsi featured celebrities like Michael Jackson, Michael J. Fox and Madonna, and his long list of awards includes ADDYs, Clios, One Show Pencils, and Gold Lions at Cannes. In recognition of a lifetime of creative achievement, Phil was inducted into the American Advertising Federation Hall of Fame in 2003 and The One Club Creative Hall of Fame in October 2007. Raised in Brooklyn, the son of a cab driver, Phil graduated from Midwood High School. He attended Emory & Henry College in Virginia on an athletic scholarship but left when the athletic program was cancelled. After that, he was mostly and very effectively self-taught. He joined BBDO New York as a copywriter in 1962 and rose to become the agency's Chief Creative Officer, then Chairman and CEO, and finally Chairman of BBDO North America. Under Phil's leadership, BBDO was named ''Agency of the Year'' on four different occasions by the leading industry publications, and the agency enjoyed unprecedented growth with the addition of such renowned brands as FedEx, HBO, Pizza Hut and Cingular, to name a few. ''The work, the work, the work'' became the agency's mantra. Phil's contributions to public service were many and varied. He spearheaded the team that worked with Mayor Giuliani to develop the ''New York Miracle'' campaign, raising New York City's spirits following 9/11. He led the Ad Council's Freedom Corps effort urging volunteerism as well as the Council's more recent ''Don't Almost Give'' public service messages that ran this year. He was Chairman of the 4A's and served on the Boards of the New York Coalition for the Homeless, the Silver Shield Foundation of New York and the Twin Towers Fund. Phil was also a member of the ''Tuesday Team'' that helped reelect Ronald Reagan in 1984. His filmed tribute, ''Final Journey,'' subsequently became a permanent part of the Reagan Presidential Library. A lifelong baseball and die-hard Yankee fan, he cowrote the screenplay for the Robert Redford movie, ''The Natural.'' His philosophy towards business and advertising is best summed up by the title of his 2005 memoir, ''One Great Insight Is Worth a Thousand Good Ideas.'' Phil lived in Manhattan, Sag Harbor, NY and St. Thomas, VI. He was a member of the East Hampton Golf Club and Blind Brook Country Club in Westchester, and an active member of St. Andrew's R.C. Church in Sag Harbor. This September, he received the St. Agnes Medal of Service from the Diocese of Rockville Centre. He is survived by his wife, Susan; his stepson, Ben Procter; a daughter-inlaw, Ilana Sparrow; a brother Harry and wife Marcy; a brother Joseph; a sister Jean Driscoll and husband Jack; and a large extended family. A wake will be held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street in Manhattan on Thursday evening, January 3rd, from 7pm to 9pm, and Friday, January 4th, from 2pm to 4pm and 7pm to 9pm.

Her completed crossword puzzles in Latin were often posted on the bulletin board. She had a beautiful voice, loved to sing, and sang on the radio in the years before her 1938 marriage. In the early 1930's she was a member of the Blue Hill Troupe, singing in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, and active as a Young Republican. She was Chairman of the LVIS Fair in East Hampton in 1968: Her first grandson was due the date of the Fair, and all the ladies thought he should be named ELVIS! For many years she was Chairman of Books at both the LVIS Fair in East Hampton (where she turned her small guest cottage into a temporary book store) and, with her dear friend, Eleanor Rawlings, at the All Saints Church Strawberry Festival in Great Neck. During these past few weeks, she hummed and sang Christmas carols, along with the radio and TV. A cheerful, kind, strong, resilient, and intelligent lady, she knew many of the answers on ''Jeopardy'', ''Wheel of Fortune'' and ''Millionaire'', which she enjoyed watching with her wonderful nurses, her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, when they visited.

2008-01-03T00:00:00Z,"Teresa Chang spent the better part of the last decade perfecting the art of making porcelain teapots. It might seem obsessive, but Ms. Chang, who trained as an architect and then made a name for herself creating dinnerware, believes strongly in the combination of form and function. ''The teapot is the ultimate challenge -- the spout alone has about six different parameters,'' Ms. Chang said from her Philadelphia studio. ''Get one wrong and your tea dribbles.'' Needless to say, Ms. Chang's teapots do not dribble. Then again, she studied under Ah Leon, a Taiwanese ceramist considered by many to be a teapot master. He pushed her to set higher standards, and the result is beautiful and functional handmade teapots meant to be used, not merely displayed on a shelf.
