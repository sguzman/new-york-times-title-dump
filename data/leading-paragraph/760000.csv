The author is Professor of the French Language and Literature in the Columbian University at Washington.

With him politics is business, strictly business, and no American citizen has ever more successfully blended the two into an indissoluble and perfect union."
1891-12-19T00:00:00Z,"The last public meeting of the Committee on Building Laws was held yesterday afternoon in the Mutual Life Building.

The fashions have thus arrived to a permanent point of decision, and the leading houses have sent out their invitations to their patrons to come and inspect the novelties. As a rule, I think I shall be safe in saying that the great change from the Autumn styles is in details only."

1891-12-20T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Dec. 19. -- Such contrasts as those now being afforded to a curious world by the Parliaments at Berlin and Paris tempt one to feel that after all there is something to be said for despotism. Of course, one must admit the qualification that it all depends on the despot. Germany owed her enslavement in the manacles of protection to one; she owes her very considerable emancipation from those chains now to another."

At Daly's the comedy of ""As You Like It"" will be revived, and Miss Rehan's blithe Rosalind will be just in keeping with the mirthful spirit of the season. It is Mr. Daly's idea that the tone of this pastoral play should be gay and joyous, indicating the buoyancy of happy youth. This idea is perfectly carried out in his production of the comedy."
1891-12-20T00:00:00Z,"Since the introduction of small-calibre rifles into the various European armies there has been no opportunity in actual battle to test the destructive powers of the new weapons. It should be understood that the small-calibre rifles have given higher velocities, with corresponding low trajectories, and have not only assured greater accuracy, but increased the danger space."

1891-12-24T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 23. -- Speaker Crisp announced the standing and select committees of the House to-day at noon.

One was forced to admit that his reputation was not good."

Of course, it is out of the question that this claim, or any part of it, should be paid except at the end of a lawsuit, and highly unlikely that it will be paid in that event."

1891-12-24T00:00:00Z,"The observation that the City of New-York is governed quite as well as it deserves to be has long since passed into an axiom.

1891-12-26T00:00:00Z,"An article on ""The Pardoning Power,"" signed by DAVID B. HILL, appears in the January number of the North America Review. It is a sufficiently commonplace article, presenting no novel conclusions, but it gives evidence of some meditation on the part of the writer, and will be found instructive to the average reader."
1891-12-26T00:00:00Z,"TOPEKA, Kan., Dec. 25. -- Like one of the tornadoes that wrought so much damage in Western Kansas, the Alliance swept all before it, and now that its fury is spent, those in the movement have time to look about and meditate upon the results, as well as their future prospect.

1891-12-26T00:00:00Z,"CITY OF MEXICO, Dec. 25. -- Further partionlars of the religious riots in Puebla are to the effect that they were caused by the enforcement of an old law against organized religious bodies.

1891-12-26T00:00:00Z,"Mr. SPRINGER is not the only person who appears to have overlooked some of the most interesting provisions of the McKinley tariff.

1891-12-27T00:00:00Z,"With this sketch my reminiscences of the Southern mountaineers will end, at least for the present, not because I have exhausted my material, but because I do not wish to test the patience of THE TIMES'S readers, who have been kind enough to indorse the accuracy of my pictures and reports."

1891-12-27T00:00:00Z,Mr. Chamberlain is probably one of the most ignorant of our public men in everything beyond the municipal affairs of Birmingham.

We have no desire to draw lessons from the opera season; but it is doing its own teaching in such a forcible, direct, and unmistakable manner that the lessons clamor for recognition."

1891-12-27T00:00:00Z,"The Pope has certainly been very ill advised in determining to confer a decoration upon the Archbishop of Aix as a mark of sympathy with the Archbishop in his recent trial.

Of course, she didn't know the value of the contents of the envelope she treated so unceremoniously. Even in the Wall Street district $45,000 is not to be shunned. In fact, in the present dull times, 45 cents would probably receive distinguished consideration in that financial centre."
