As the Miami Heat work their way toward the N.B.A. record of 33 consecutive victories, Battier, a Duke graduate, is providing plenty of ammunition for both camps, playing a key role for a team that since LeBron James’s “Decision” might as well be the Blue Devils of the N.B.A. His success is a perfect storm for those who love to hate Duke."

“It’s really hard to put your finger on it,” Katerina Gregos told me. We were sitting in a coffee shop in a residential neighborhood on the south side of Brussels; it was an overcast Sunday afternoon. Gregos, a Greek woman with a British education, is the new artistic director of Art Brussels, the city’s contemporary art fair, and she was struggling to explain the specific appeal of her adoptive city. Outside, the streets were empty. On my way to meet her I had passed blocks that looked like a two-thirds scale model of Paris, and others that looked as Dutch as Amsterdam. “You can’t really describe what Brussels is, because Brussels doesn’t announce itself with an image,” she said. “It’s a place where things are quite hidden. It’s a city that’s in a perpetual state of becoming.”"

In a stroke of brilliant understatement, Wilmotte made the fragile and dreamlike 19th-century atmosphere of this forgotten corner of Paris’s Ninth Arrondissement the main decorative element of his design for the hotel by treating the windows like picture frames onto the surrounding neighborhood. You see the facades and rooftops of Paris and the 19th-century church of Saint Eugène and Saint Cécile (where Jules Verne was married). The rooms pass on what you might think of as modern luxury and instead emphasize the beauty of raw materials: there are taupe linen veneers at the windows, carpets of straw-colored organic Swedish wool on the floors, and Oregon myrtle wood accessories in the white marble Japanese-style soaking tubs. Most of these tubs are carved from single blocks of stone. This place gets the smaller details right, too, from Artemide lamps built into the headboards to bonbons from the nearby confectioner A la Mere de Famille (founded in 1761 and famous for its candied chestnuts)."

2013-03-24T00:00:00Z,"Was it murder? Or gunplay gone wrong? In “Phil Spector” a voluptuously wigged-out Al Pacino reunites with the writer and director David Mamet — their “Glengarry Glen Ross” revival left Broadway in January — to portray Mr. Spector, the music producer and songwriter charged with the 2003 shooting death of the actress Lana Clarkson at his mansion in Alhambra, Calif. Helen Mirren plays Linda Kenney Baden, the lawyer who represented him alongside Bruce Cutler (Jeffrey Tambor) at his first trial in 2007, which resulted in a hung jury. (He was convicted in 2009 and is serving 19 years to life.) The movie, which has its premiere on Sunday at 9 p.m. on HBO, has already set off controversy: Mr. Spector’s wife, Rachelle, has complained about the film’s depiction of her husband as “a foul-mouthed megalomaniac.” Edward Lozzi, a former publicist for Ms. Clarkson, has taken exception to the film’s focus on the defense’s argument that she killed herself. 
 
The film is a work of fiction, Mr. Mamet said in an HBO interview, spun from his fascination with Mr. Spector’s character “and the mythological possibilities.” Why do certain events, like the O. J. Simpson trial, become big stories? “The fall from grace is common in all of these,” he said."

The law firm of Rastegar & Matern deeply mourns the loss of its beloved friend and irreplaceable colleague, Paul Jacob Weiner, who died in December after a brave year-long battle with a rare cancer. Born in 1949, Paul earned a BA Magna Cum Laude in Physics and an MS in Applied Mathematics simultaneously at Harvard University in 1971, followed by a JD Cum Laude from Harvard School of Law in 1974. He was President of the Harvard Law Record and studied with Arthur R. Miller, Laurence Tribe, and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Paul's litigation career began in 1975 at Breed, Abbott & Morgan in New York. He was a lead counsel of record on precedentially important cases involving unfair competition, such as Johnson & Johnson v. Carter-Wallace. He also served as an Adjunct Professor of Law at Hofstra Law School from 1988 to 1990 and practiced at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto. Paul joined Rastegar & Matern in Los Angeles in 1995, developing not only mutual respect and admiration between him and partners Farzad Rastegar and Matthew Matern, but a true and deep friendship that lasted the rest of his life. At R & M, Paul appeared as second chair to and on the brief with Professor Erwin Chemerinsky in the case United States v. Waksberg, which involved separation of powers issues. He achieved many reported appellate victories which helped shape the law in California, including Ventura v. ABM, Franco v. Arakelian, Fuentes v. AutoZone, Gutierrez v. Commerce Club, and Pantoja v. Anton, considered one of the most important employment law cases in the past decade. He worked tirelessly and without fanfare to help his clients with unparalleled legal acumen and mentored dozens of young attorneys who will carry on his legacy. Paul is affectionately remembered by his large circle of friends, colleagues, college and law school alumni, and family as a true Renaissance man a brilliant intellectual, a talented writer whose funny puns and witty repartee amused and inspired, an avid lover of music and the arts and especially as a genuinely kind, generous, warm-hearted cat, a gentle and humble soul whose faith in God's will was as deep as his ecumenical spirit was wide, faithfully embracing his Jewish traditions and desirously learning about the faith traditions of his friends. In the words of Paul's surgeon, I only got a glimpse of a truly remarkable man. Paul is survived by his sister Janet Doerflinger and niece Jane Doerflinger, his aunt Etta Schlesinger, his uncle Louis Fine, and by everyone whose lives he touched and enriched. The world is a better place because Paul was here. Paul requested that donations made in his name go to a charity that feeds the hungry. The family has designated the SOVA Community Food and Resource Program of Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles. Donations can be made on-line: www.jfsla.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=400 or by mail to SOVA, 16439 Vanowen St., Van Nuys, CA 91406. Please specify you are making a tribute donation in memory of Paul J.

I shivered in the July heat. Hundreds of similar stacks of letters, albeit stored in acid-free manuscript boxes in library archives, were the reason it had taken me 20 years to finish the book. I’d thought I was done with all that. Could I face more weeks of deciphering the sisters’ difficult handwriting — and would my publisher give me the time?

2013-03-24T00:00:00Z,"These days, when it comes to designing hotels and resorts in out-of-the-way places, less is more. Instead of historically inspired villas or clusters of vernacular-style huts or cottages, architects are embracing a kind of eco-modernism, with quietly powerful structures that take their cues — literally — from the landscape. Rather than imposing themselves on their spectacular surroundings, these buildings become part of them, sometimes so much so that it’s hard to tell where the natural stops and the man-made begins.
 
 Hotel Fasano Las Piedras High above Punta del Este, Uruguay, the Brazilian architect Isay Weinfeld designed 32 concrete bungalows with rustic stone bases that seem to nestle naturally into their rocky hillside setting. The austerity of their exteriors contrasts with the warm, Brazilian Modernist vibe of the interiors."

Born in Shanghai, China in 1929, she proudly honored the legacy of her great-grandfather Li Hung-chang, a leading political figure of the late Qing Dynasty. Much of her youth was marked by the Japanese occupation of China, World War II, and the Chinese Civil War, which forced her family to flee to Taiwan in 1948. However, her story was one of survival and resilience. She fought for the chance to study in the United States, where she earned her master's degree in library science. In 1960, she married Steven Wu, a civil engineer in New York. Lily and Steven (who passed away in 2011) are survived by their daughters and sons-in-law, Vivian and John De Leon, Sylvia and Robert Burns, and Loretta and John Mahon, and their seven grandchildren, Bruce, Ilia, Stephanie, Suzanne, Patrick, Kelin, and Erin.

2013-03-24T00:00:00Z,"The other day you may have read about Patrick Robinson, the former Gap creative director, who is producing a new line, Paskho, with money he hopes to raise on Kickstarter. Among crowd-funding sites, Kickstarter is the largest, with more 30,000 projects financed and $300 million in pledges. A virtue of these sites is that for a small sum an investor can feel included in the creative process, whether it’s a film or an amazing sweatshirt. If the project is successful, investors receive a reward or privilege.
 
But while this system is clearly popular, you wonder why investors don’t expect something more tangible — like, well, cash. And, as Jenna Wortham has pointed out in The New York Times, a drawback for creators is that they can spend more time communicating with investors than they anticipated. It’s a pain, in short. There are also production snafus that can delay or kill a project."

It was also the backdrop of the Profumo Affair, the political sex scandal that brought down Prime Minister Harold Macmillan’s government 50 years ago. A recent renovation has transformed the manor, located an hour outside of London, into an aristo fantasy camp, complete with 38 Edwardian rooms and a storybook riverside cottage that comes with its own butler, on request. Owned by the National Trust, the luxury hotel and spa overlooks 376 acres of forests and meadows. There’s a garden maze, a 19th-century parterre and a full range of anachronistic amusements — from snooker to archery to a lazy river cruise on an electric canoe that Lady Astor had built for herself in the 1920s.
 
Cliveden’s face-lift coincides with a new Andrew Lloyd Weber musical about the Profumo Affair that may have its debut as early as this summer at his Sydmonton Festival in Hampshire. Despite its naughty history, the estate perfectly embodies a maxim by one of its frequent guests, Henry James. “Of all the great things that the English have invented,” he wrote, “the one they have mastered most completely… is the well-appointed, well-administered, well-filled country house.” Rooms from about $390; clivedenhouse.co.uk ."

He is survived by his wife Martha, daughter Melissa, son-in-law David, granddaughter Marcella, brother Ted and loyal pooch Louis. Tom graduated from Colgate University in 1952. Following a tour of duty in the army as a first lieutenant, he joined Grey Advertising holding positions that included running Grey's European operations out of London. Returning stateside, he moved from New York to Chicago to work with the advertising agency, J Walter Thompson. In October 1973, Tom made the jump to the client side, taking an executive position with Uncle Ben's Rice in Houston, Texas. He became president of this division of Mars, Incorporated and later was president of Mars' Kal Kan operations in Vernon, California. He retired from the Mars Corporation in 1992 after 19 years of service and he and Martha moved back to Houston. After a couple years out west, the couple decided to make New York City their permanent home and settled into an apartment on the east side. Tom was a big guy- 6'5"" and about 200 pounds (depending). He could whack a golf ball 300 yards- although he wouldn't necessarily be able to tell you where it landed. He was a lover of the arts and a devoted, generous supporter who served on the boards of the Houston Grand Opera and other organizations. He was a wizard in the kitchen, creating his own dishes that prompted long and sincere lip-smacking. Tom and Martha loved to travel and spent months each year in London and Rome (he spoke Italian molto bene). He loved New York City best, though: its theater, its opera, its restaurants, shops, parks and, especially, its streets. He felt that the best way to experience the city was on foot. This was no casual conviction. He'd sometimes walk 60 or 70 miles a week. And in cowboy boots, no less. In keeping with Tom's wishes, there will be no services. However, he would be happy if you'd remember him with a donation to the Harlem Children's Zone (www.hcz.org)."
2013-03-24T00:00:00Z,"DOUGLAS--Archibald III, of Narragansett, RI, died March 19 after a long illness bravely borne. Born July 18, 1929 in New York City, he attended Buckley School, St. Paul's School, and Yale University '52. He also served proudly as a Marine lieutenant in the Korean War. A business executive at many companies, he found his greatest success at Kingsford and Wite-Out, Inc. Archie's life was distinguished by fierce competitiveness and accomplishment. A superior athlete at St. Paul's, in 1947 he became the first non-senior to win the Gordon Medal. As a senior, he traveled to England as a member of the Winant Volunteers, serving war-torn Britain and receiving a royal audience with the King. At Yale, his proudest affiliation was his three year participation on the ice hockey team under legendary coach Murray Murdoch. The 1951-1952 team, arguably the finest in Yale's history, ascended to the finals of the NCAA tournament. He loved to regale his children with stories of how he was a poor skater but ""good in the corners."" Most memorable was his tale of spitting his false teeth onto the ice to draw a major penalty against any opposing player who checked him. Archie won the National Junior Squash Championships at 18 and went on to excel in racquet sports throughout his life. From Old Black Point CT, Gates Mills OH, Louisville KY, Princeton NJ and finally Narragansett RI, he and his wife Wayne competed vigorously and loudly as a team in tennis and paddle tennis for decades, while miraculously staying married. Blessed with a strong tenor voice, Archie loved to sing and play the piano. He participated in the St. Paul's School Choir, the O's & B's at Yale, and was a passionate extra for the Louisville Opera, his oft repeated solo -- ""The Supper's Ready"" -- becoming a matter of family lore. He also performed in memorable musical revues at the Louisville Country Club. Archie was a founding Board member of St. Francis School in Louisville. He led the fundraising campaign for the St. Paul's Class of 1948's 50th reunion, resulting in a new record for contributions. In his 70s, he served on the Board of Governors of the Yeamans Hall Club in Charleston, SC where he and Wayne made their winter home. He enjoyed a lifelong love for fishing and hunting, nurtured by boyhood summers spent at the Adirondack League Club in Old Forge, New York. Archie introduced each of his children and grandchildren to the world of fly-fishing for trout on Little Moose Lake and the South Branch of the Moose River, a world that, for him, possessed almost mystical power and significance. Later in life, he developed a passion for the pursuit of Atlantic salmon, traveling to northern Quebec and Labrador and twice to Russia. He also enjoyed frequent trips to New Brunswick's famed Miramichi River. In retirement, when not fishing for salmon, trout, bonefish, bluefish, or striped bass, Archie devoted himself to the pursuit of birdies, eagles and pars. He remained a dedicated golfer even after being declared legally blind. His keen memory and understanding of each course's challenges meant that he was always a threat to win the hole. He could be counted upon to explain that he was a great putter but needed distance. Archie is survived by his wife of almost 57 years, Wayne Goss Douglas, his daughters Daisy Savage, Eliza McErlean and Deirdre Carey, his son Archibald Douglas IV, eight grandchildren, his brother and sister Geoffrey Douglas and Eleanor Douglas, and numerous cousins, nieces and nephews. His brother, James A.M. Douglas, predeceased him. Archie will be missed terribly by all but the trout of Little Moose Lake and the salmon of eastern Canada. They can finally relax; their nemesis has passed on. A memorial service is planned for April 5 at 11am at St. Peter's by-the-Sea Episcopal Church, 72 Central Street, Narragansett. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Archie's name to South County Hospital, 100 Kenyon Street, Wakefield I 02879 and St. Paul's School, 325 Pleasant Street, Concord NH 03301. A memorial message may be sent to the family by visiting our website at www.jhenrystuhr.com."

2013-03-24T00:00:00Z,"WUNSCH--Eric M. A creative powerhouse in the fields of engineering, alternative thinking and art collecting died at 88. Mr. Wunsch died peacefully in his home on Gramercy Park on March 20, 2013. Known as Martin to his friends, he initially applied his creativity license to mechanical engineering designing and building numerous materials-handling vehicles, such as deft, mobile cranes used by the military in World War II; electric fork lifts; capstans; and giant container handling devices with enormous capacities that helped expand the ports of America exponentially. During the last 40 years, he turned his interest to the arts. His personal and business collections of American furniture and old masters paintings are unparalleled in private American collecting. Just as importantly, he amassed a vast wealth of scholarship which led like-minded collectors and curators to join him in working to preserve America's art history. Born in Brooklyn on July 27, 1924, he graduated Poly Prep with great haste, going on to matriculate at MIT before his 17th birthday. With the ink on his Masters in Engineering barely dry, he joined the Army and was stationed in the Pacific Rim during WWII. Upon his return, he joined the Wunsch family business, Silent Hoist & Crane, creating unique mobile materials-handling equipment to solve engineering challenges by ""taking the load off a man's back"". He piloted his own plane on sales calls throughout the country and built the brand to a premier level in the industry. To those who knew him well Martin Wunsch was a loyal friend and a very special man who always had a smile, and an opinion. He will be missed. He is survived by his wife of 61 years Ethel, sister Rosa Durando, son Peter, daughter-in-law Susi, and his beloved grandsons Eric and Noah. A memorial service will be held 11:00am, Thursday, April 25th at Christies New York, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, in lieu of flowers the family requests a donation be made to Alzheimer's Association."

By the mid-2000s, once-bustling squares and boulevards were shadows of their glamorous former selves. But the winds of change have shifted. Construction cranes now swing over Breitscheidplatz, and the streets buzz with shoppers and diners. “The city is reorienting itself to the west,” says Stefanie Hering, who will open a flagship store for her porcelain design company, Hering Berlin , in the new Waldorf-Astoria hotel building this spring. The Waldorf, occupying a new high-rise steps from the Zoo station, is only the beginning. Recently opened on the main boulevard Kurfürstendamm, Haus Cumberland is a restored hotel from the early 1900s that houses several welcome arrivals, among them Grosz — a coffeehouse and restaurant evoking 1920s Berlin.
 
Elsewhere, the former Danish Embassy has been turned into Das Stue hotel . And planned for this fall are a 25hours hotel by the German designer Werner Aisslinger , and an outpost by the culty east-side fashion pioneer Andreas Murkudis . Apple is reportedly coming to the Ku’damm, and even the Gedächtniskirche , a West Berlin landmark whose spire was lopped-off in the war, is getting its long-overdue restoration. “For years they said that something would happen,” says Michel Würthle, owner of the legendary — and now trendy again — Paris Bar. “Suddenly the boom is here.”"

My grandfather didn’t like to be driven — he liked to drive. Ninety percent of the time his chauffeur sat in the passenger seat and just made small talk with him about soccer. In terms of distinction and elegance, my grandfather was always looking to make his own cars more beautiful. My work today is a tribute to him — I make bespoke cars for Ferrari — but he was more understated when it came to aesthetics than I am. Nevertheless he taught me how to appreciate beautiful objects. At the museum are many of his favorite cars — like the baby Bugatti toy car he drove when he was a boy and many of his favorite Fiats, including the 130 station wagon, designed by Pininfarina in 1975, which is almost like a precursor to the sports utility vehicle.

2013-03-24T00:00:00Z,"This issue starts off in America, or at least an idea of America. Brooklyn , N.Y., has, as we all know, become a bastion of handcrafted, locally sourced, small-scale-production everything, from bikes to beer. The irony is that this passion for authenticity, diversity and a longing for realness have now turned what was once just a borough into a global brand, one that is vigorously being exported around the world: France, Russia, the United Arab Emirates. The local has gone global, or in other words, anti-homogenization is itself now being homogenized: In Paris you find food trucks, in Gorky Park a snack kiosk called Williamsburg, there is a Brooklyn Diner in Dubai, and even the native beer, Brooklyn Brewery, is planning an outpost in Stockholm — how local is that? When a value system based on unscalability starts to scale, it may be time to turn to other locales for a sense of uniqueness and locally grown culture.
 
In this issue, we went searching for the world’s new cultural capitals, places percolating with individuality. In Seoul, thanks to the newly cash-fueled economy, development is indeed happening superfast, but in a way that doesn’t feel like just a mad rush to acquire Western food and fashion, but rather feels truly Korean, completely cool and still underappreciated. In Brussels , we found a powerful new art center. The city’s art scene is quite unlike those in Paris, Berlin, London and New York, particularly because it is totally un-sceney. There is a thoughtful, convivial community of artists, enthusiasts and collectors devoted to young, and even somewhat difficult art. And in São Paulo , the new middle class is challenging the city’s rigid social stratification and gentrifying and revitalizing formerly blighted districts and turning them into vibrant night life hubs. In Paris , French cuisine is being created from the bottom up rather than the top down. A group of young, multicultural chefs are bringing their diverse perspectives and passion for locally sourced meat and produce to their new restaurants. It is in fact a little like Brooklyn in that sense. But, in the authentic sense, in that it is a global, modern sensibility transforming and reinvigorating the age-old hegemony of la gastronomie française."
2013-03-24T00:00:00Z,"Biarritz has long been known as the surfing capital of France — ever since the American screenwriter Peter Viertel arrived on its beach during the filming of “The Sun Also Rises” in 1956. Nowadays, major surf brands like Quiksilver and O’Neill have offices, shops and competitions in the area. But lately, a more indie surf-meets-art-meets-fashion scene has sprung up, as cool young Parisians settle into this grand old town overlooking the Atlantic. Their presence — not just in summer but increasingly year-round — has transformed Biarritz and its surrounding beach towns from what was once a resort for bourgeois retirees into a breezy bohemian outpost that has come to be called “the French California.” It’s sunnier, friendlier and more rough-hewn than much of France, tied by its hardy Basque roots to its Spanish neighbors just over the border.
 
“St. Tropez used to be the cool place to be in France, but it became too bling-bling, so the real cool is here now,” says Thibault Taniou, 30. He and his girlfriend, Audrey Perrot, 28, met as classical dancers in Paris but now live here full-time. They own a minimalist fashion boutique, In the Middle, which stocks hip labels like Grenson and Warriors of Radness . “Madonna visited Guéthary two summers ago,” he says with pride, referring to a trendy rustic village down the coast. (She came with her young boyfriend, the French model-dancer Brahim Zaibat.) Other famous Biarritz-goers include the actress Monica Bellucci and the French electro singer Sébastien Tellier , whose cheesy-sensual hit, “Roche,” begins, “I dream of Biarritz in summer.”"
2013-03-24T00:00:00Z,"There was a time — before his Oscars, Bergmanesque dramas and lofty eminence — when Woody Allen was just a hot stand-up and very funny emerging filmmaker. In the anarchic “Bananas” (1971), to be screened Thursday at the IFC Center, the humor is all there is, and it’s plenty. Mr. Allen plays Fielding Mellish, a hapless product tester who, inspired by his ex-girlfriend (the incomparable Louise Lasser), travels to a South American banana republic and joins a revolutionary militia. Needless to say, it’s not work the bumbling Mellish is suited for. 
 
Mr. Allen, however, more than delivers, in a performance blending Groucho Marx, silent-movie physicality and references to Kierkegaard, abetted by Marvin Hamlisch’s buoyant and clever score. The movie’s texture is ragged, but the gags fly, evidence of a comic genius firing on all cylinders. Watch for Sylvester Stallone in a small role as a mugger.

2013-03-24T00:00:00Z,"FRIEDMAN--Robert G.,of Ft. Lauderdale, FL, and formerly of Tiffin, OH, passed away peacefully in his home, surrounded by his loving family, including his wife of nearly 65 years, Eugenie S. Friedman; granddaughter of Oscar F. Mayer, and their five children, on Monday, March 18, 2013. Bob recently celebrated his 90th birthday, and would have celebrated his 65th wedding anniversary on May 1. Bob Friedman was born on February 6, 1923, to Genevieve (Jane) Mahank and John H. Friedman in Tiffin, OH. He was preceded in death by his sisters, Betty Jane and Rosalie Friedman, and Janie Congdon Stall. Bob was the leader of his own ten-piece jazz band, ""The Melodiers,"" while at Tiffin Columbian High School. Bob attended Case Western Reserve University where he was inducted into The Engineering Honor Society, Tau Beta Pi. Following his graduation from Case with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and attendance at Harvard Business School, Bob served as a Naval Officer aboard the Battleship Texas during World War II. After the war, Bob rose through the ranks of The National Machinery Company (National) in Tiffin, OH and became the President and Chief Executive Officer for almost three decades. During his tenure, National became not only the largest employer in Tiffin, but also the largest global manufacturer of hot and cold forging and forming machinery, capturing 52% of the world market. In 1958, Bob led the acquisition of J.G. Kayser Company in Nuremberg, Germany, establishing manufacturing and distribution for National in Europe. He also negotiated contracts with the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War, Fiat Motor Company in Italy, and Pratt & Whitney. Bob invented and received a patent for the first machine to stamp a seamless aluminum can as well as for the manufacture of the blades and buckets for jet engines. Under his leadership, National achieved widespread industry recognition and success as an early pioneer of profit-sharing, employee stock ownership and productivity bonus programs. During the past 43 years he maintained a deep and abiding love for those who had worked with him. Following his work at National the family relocated to Ft. Lauderdale, FL where stock portfolio analysis and management were his passion. Bob became the founding investor and served for over twenty years as Chairman of the Board of Direct Supply, Inc., the nation's largest supplier to the long term care industry. Bob also pursued composition of music and lyrics for over 100 songs which were performed or arranged by jazz greats including Joe Williams, Ray Brown, Louie Belson, Lou Rawls, Benny Carter, Ernestine Anderson, Marian McPartland, Carmen McRae, Billy May, Matty Matlock, Flip Phillips, Johnny Mercer and Quincy Jones, with many of whom he also developed lasting friendships. Joe Williams performed Bob's songs on ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,"" and Quincy Jones included one of Bob's songs, ""A Tribute to Benny Carter,"" in his ""Best of Quincy Jones"" album. His music has been performed by the Milwaukee and Jacksonville Symphonies and also by the award-winning University of Miami Jazz Band. He was inducted into the Big Band Hall of Fame in Palm Beach, FL in 1992. Bob was most proud of his first song for his wife, ""Serenade to Genie,"" and the five songs he wrote for each of his children, ""Betty,"" ""Jenny,"" ""Mary,"" ""Jane"" and ""Bobby. Bob and Genie believed themselves to have been blessed, and that with these successes came both the privilege and the obligation to share. Through The Robert G. Friedman Foundation, Bob and Genie shared their blessings with many, including the Institute for Civic Involvement at Pine Crest School, Holy Cross Hospital, Smith College, Northwestern University and Curious Kids Museum. Bob was first and foremost a devoted husband; father and friend, whose loyalty and love were unsurpassed. Says his son, Robert T. Friedman, ""My Dad's many accomplishments are an inspiration to us all and his most enduring gift is the love he gave so freely and deeply to our family."" Bob Friedman is survived by his wife, Eugenie Steuer Friedman, and his children, Robert Taft Friedman of Chicago, IL, Elizabeth (Daniel) O'Connor of Fort Lauderdale, FL, Jennifer (Robert) Hillis of Milwaukee, WI, Mary (Douglas) Baske of Fort Lauderdale, FL, and Jane (Robert) Anspach of Perrysburg, OH; fifteen grandchildren (Eugenie (Kahlil) O'Connor, Elizabeth (Chris) Elsbury, Danny (Solidea) O'Connor, Catherine (Sean) Hough, Genevieve (Brian) Hillis, Bobby Hillis, Alison (Vance) Wiese, Adam (Abby) Baske, Emily (Fletcher) Reeves, Michael Anspach, Bobby Anspach, John Anspach, James Friedman, Will Friedman and Mary Friedman) and seven great-grandchildren (Jackson and Evelyn Reeves, Ava Wiese, Jack and Patrick Elsbury, Connor Hough and Elisa O'Connor). Bob Friedman's legacy is best summarized by his own words, as embodied in his song, ""God Bless You:"" God Bless You, with peace of mind. And help you see the thrill of being kind. God give you your faith again, And help you see the good in other men. And so will those who knew and loved him, will remember him. The family wishes to extend its love and eternal thanks to Dr. Joel Gellman for his extraordinary care of Bob. And to Marta Bosch, whose many years of friendship and devotion deserve the most heartfelt thanks. Finally, to all of Bob's wonderful caregivers, Rick Shaw, Elva Hodzic, Karen Wirkus, Antonia Antunez, Nuno Hodzic and Mark Alexander, the family extends its undying gratitude. Visitation will be at Fred Hunter Funeral Home, 718 South Federal Highway, on Sunday, March 24th from 4-6pm, with Funeral Mass to be held at St. Anthony's Church on Monday, March 25th at 10am.

France is already on its fifth republic — it’s no stranger to revolution. But the country’s dining has always been stubbornly resistant to change. At least until recently. The “bistronomy” trend of the last decade, which made high art out of humble French food, has broken through the totalitarianism of haute cuisine and its Michelin-starred palaces. Now in France like everywhere else, cooking shows and social networking have turned food into a bona fide pop culture. And an EasyJet-fueled mobility has given young French gastronauts the freedom to sample more exotic cuisines than their parents could have ever imagined."

His father was a county 4H agent and brought up his children to be industrious and disciplined. Eldon attended school in Kingsley, graduating as valedictorian of his high school class in 1954. He won a scholarship to the University of Michigan and entered as an honors student. He completed his undergraduate studies in the School of Business Administration in three and a half years, graduating first in his class. He began working on an M.B.A. degree in the interim between his graduation and the beginning of law school. In law school, he distinguished himself by winning the Campbell Competition, a moot court competition. He was also a member of the Law Review and the Barristers Society. In 1961, he graduated with a J.D. and an M.B.A., completing three degrees in seven years. He achieved all this while working to support himself. During this time, he also met his future wife, Mary. They married in 1961 and moved to New York City. He began his legal career as a clerk for Judge Leonard P. Moore of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. After his clerkship, he joined the firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore as an associate. In 1970 he left Cravath to become the first General Counsel of PriceWaterhouse. He was admitted to the partnership of PriceWaterhouse in 1973. By the time he retired in 1996, he had built the Office of the General Counsel from a one-man operation to a substantial presence in New York and San Francisco. As General Counsel, his responsibilities included managing all the Firm's litigation and its liability insurance program, including the Firm's relationships with Lloyds of London and the liability entities servicing the country's major accounting firms. He was a member of the New York State and City Bar Associations, the Michigan Bar Association, and a member of the U.S. Supreme Court bar. He was also a member of the American Law Institute. Over the years, he was a frequent panelist on Practicing Law Institute events. Eldon was a serious genealogist and in his retirement completed a carefully documented three volume genealogical history of his family. Eldon is survived by his wife of fifty-one years, Mary, his children, Eric, Ann, and Evan, eight grandchildren, and a brother, Jerry. He was preceded in death by his parents and his sister, Linda. Eldon should be remembered for his honesty, courage, and discipline. These are virtues that he held to tenaciously in his personal and professional life. He was also a man who cared deeply for his family and his friends. He had a strong faith in Christ and faced death with the assurance of His promises.

Valentino, Bottega Veneta and Raf Simons showed the majority (if not all) of their looks with sneakers instead of proper oxfords. Some designers were even more specific with their sporty adaptions — as in the case of the young British designer Lou Dalton, who created this high-fashion take on a baseball shirt ($399; openingceremony.us ).
 
To be clear, these are not clothes meant for wearing on the field or court.

Tourists arrive in São Paulo and are understandably kind of shocked by the place,” Facundo Guerra told me one night in January. We were having dinner at Z Carniceria , an old butcher shop on Rua Augusta that he has turned into a restaurant, meat hooks still hanging above the bar. The area around Rua Augusta used to be a decaying red-light district just a few years ago, but now it is the center of the city’s night life, filled with bars and clubs, several opened by Guerra and other investors, that cater to people from across the city’s social spectrum. Many of them appeared to be at Z Carniceria that night — tattoos seemed almost mandatory, as if the suit-and-tie elite found in the city’s great canyons of skyscrapers inhabited some other land. “But travelers are another matter,” Guerra continued. “They step foot in the city’s labyrinth, and some of them take years to explore.”"

2013-03-24T00:00:00Z,"TAYLOR--James Robert II, passed away on March 20. No, not that James Taylor. Our Sweet Baby James (""Rob"") was the greatest. After the War, Rob's Dad, Jim--admittedly the worst pilot in the Air Force, but a handsome devil--returned to Kentucky, where he wed Maxine Bennett, a firecracker blonde who modeled in the local papers. Soon after Rob's birth on May 17, 1952, Pan Am transferred Jim to Cape Canaveral to oversee the nascent Space Program. Despite Rob's awesome pedigree, he did not sit at the cool kids table. A lanky, awkward teen, Rob preferred to crouch in a duck blind with his Remington and scan for canvasbacks and pintails circling the marsh. Rob's first true love was the game of tennis. He modeled his serve and volley game after the great Rod ""Rocket"" Laver, and rallied for years against the backboard, before earning a spot on the Cocoa Beach High varsity squad. At Florida State, Rob was crowned The King (one of many fraternity nicknames, including T-Bone, Tony the Tiger and Stud). As president of Phi Delt, he threw legendary parties; dumpster-dove for exam answer sheets; and conceived infamous pranks involving smoke grenades and a chocolate laxative cake. In 1975, the student body nominated Rob FSU's ""Man of the Year."" Rob worked as a tennis pro throughout his 20s. During his ""lost weekend,"" Rob commuted between nightclub and country club, where he played doubles with Capote and Sinatra, rebuffed an A-list socialite, and hit with his idol, The Rocket, before a US Open appearance. At 28, Rob packed up his tennis whites and leisure suits, and enrolled at the University of Arkansas Law School. After earning a Masters in Tax Law from SMU, he crunched numbers for big firms, such as Arthur Andersen, but missed tennis and would sometimes moonlight at his old clubs. On one such occasion, in the winter of 1989, he noticed a cutie-pie on Court 1 at the Jupiter Island Club. She, in turn, noticed his tan thighs and baby blue eyes. Game, set, match. The King had met his Queen. Rob loved Susan and her two little terrors, Hannah and Walker, whom he would ferry to school in his Jeep, leaving them always with a peppy goodbye: ""make me proud, kiddos!"" Susan eventually tamed the renowned bachelor, marrying him on May 27, 1995, in Winter Park, FL. After his cancer diagnosis in February 2011, Rob continued to work tirelessly for CFD, the flooring company he co-founded a decade earlier with his friend, Arden Kelley. He and Susan spent more time at their home in Blue Hill, ME, where they adventured up and down the coast in pursuit of driftwood and spoiled their new granddaughter, Eliza. Last summer, Susan and Rob constructed their magnum opus, a chicken/duck coop built to withstand the most brutal Nor'easter, with all manner of hatch doors and a state-of-the-art security system to thwart weasels, foxes and hen rustlers. On a recent family trip to India, Rob happened upon the Dalai Lama--twice--and exchanged pleasantries with His Holiness. Rob passed away in his sleep at home in Ft. Lauderdale. He wore a Florida State Seminoles shirt and lay peacefully beside his loveliest of loves, Susan."

Born in Shanghai, China in 1929, she proudly honored the legacy of her great-grandfather Li Hung-chang, a leading political figure of the late Qing Dynasty. Much of her youth was marked by the Japanese occupation of China, World War II, and the Chinese Civil War, which forced her family to flee to Taiwan in 1948. However, her story was one of survival and resilience. She fought for the chance to study in the United States, where she earned her master's degree in library science. In 1960, she married Steven Wu, a civil engineer in New York. Lily and Steven (who passed away in 2011) are survived by their daughters and sons-in-law, Vivian and John De Leon, Sylvia and Robert Burns, and Loretta and John Mahon, and their seven grandchildren, Bruce, Ilia, Stephanie, Suzanne, Patrick, Kelin, and Erin. To the many people who love and will deeply miss Lily, she will be remembered as many things a loving mother, a wise mentor, a modern woman, an effortless charmer, a rebel, and a champion of underdogs like herself.

2013-03-25T00:00:00Z,"The Mets shed seven players from their major league camp. Most were lost by design, but one wasby misfortune when center fielder Matt den Dekker broke his wrist. As expected, the Mets optioned catcher Travis d’Arnaud, 24, to the minor leagues, sending him off with some high praise. “He met all of our expectations, which, for the organization and Mets fans, were fairly high,” General Manager Sandy Alderson said. Alderson conceded that starting d’Arnaud at Class AAA helped the Mets from a variety of team control standpoints. But he said, hypothetically, if starter John Buck was injured, d’Arnaud would take his place. The Mets also reassigned the left-hander Aaron Laffey, infielder Brian Bixler and outfielders Jamie Hoffmann and Andrew Brown, and they sent infielder Brandon Hicks outright to the minors. Den Dekker was injured trying to make a leaping catch in a 9-4 loss to the Detroit Tigers in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Den Dekker was expected to head to New York on Monday to determine whether he would need surgery. Den Dekker, 25, had enlivened Mets camp with his spectacular defense, and Manager Terry Collins said he would not ask him to change his approach. Collins compared him to Jim Edmonds, one of his former players, whose aggressive style also put him at risk for injury. “I said, ‘The minute you stop diving, you’ll be an average player,’” Collins said of Edmonds.“And the same with Matt den Dekker. He’s that kind of player where he’s fearless, and that’s what makes him a great center fielder.” ANDREW KEH"

We hope that whatever bill emerges will continue to protect and unite families, preserving and strengthening a bedrock value of America’s immigration system.
 
It might be hard to imagine that America’s long tradition of allowing immigrants to sponsor spouses, children and siblings for visas would be threatened. But anti-immigration groups and lawmakers have long attacked the practice, using the slanderous and misleading term “chain migration,” which summons images of a relentless flow of undesirables, usually from south of the border.

2013-03-29T00:00:00Z,"POST--Dirck Hooper, passed away on Tuesday, March 13th. Born on December 28th in 1932, Dirck's father passed away when he was two and a half years old leaving him and his sister Lynn to be raised by his mother, Esther. He was an intelligent boy who mostly kept to himself, with a passion for dinosaurs. He attended college at Harvard University with the intent to major in paleontology but instead he gained a bachelor's degree with a major in Russian History. The year he graduated, Dirck married Barbara Jean Spence. Together they raised three boys, Robert, Timothy and Michael. A year after their third son was born, Dirck and his family moved to a house in Washington Township, New Jersey where they lived for many years. Dirck's vocation was in the world of finance where he had great success. As a banker, he was instrumental in the financial health of companies such as the Ice Capades, and the Harlem Globe Trotters. Along with the big companies, he also helped individuals. Dirck enjoyed bringing all sorts of people to financial stability. In 1983 after a struggle with cancer, Barbara passed away and Dirck found himself a widower. His sons were grown and starting their own lives so he adjusted to living as a bachelor once again. Some time after that, Dirck met Nancy Menegaz who would become his second wife. Together they appreciated fine dining, good wines, and travel. Nancy became Dirck's main support through difficult times including the loss of his son Timothy from leukemia, his mother's passing, and later his accident. In 1993, Dirck suffered a serious biking accident that proved nearly fatal. He fought his way to recovery with help and support from Nancy and their family. This was effectively the end of his career as he went on extended disability. During his recovery and retirement, Dirck and Nancy decided to marry. On Columbus Day in 1994 they held a ceremony on a beach in Charlestown, Rhode Island a town they now called home. In his later years, Dirck's physical abilities declined until it became difficult for him to move about. He spent much time in his recliner, although he still enjoyed weekly bridge games. He still gave help and advice freely to his family when asked. During this time, Dirck found more friends in the people who came in to help him with his daily routine, cooking and cleaning. They loved Dirck and enjoyed their time in his company and he welcomed and cared greatly for them as well. Finally, his health took a turn that he wasn't able to fight his way past. After a mercifully short time in Hospice care, Dirck passed on. He is survived by his sister Lynn, Nancy, his wife, his sons Bob and Mike, Nancy's sons Greg and Glenn and daughter Michelle. A memorial to Dirck can be found at http://memorialwebsites.legacy.com/dirckpost."

2013-03-29T00:00:00Z,"J. R. Smith has always had a knack for making it look easy, if only for brief periods. Throughout his career, Smith’s game has been defined by exquisite exhibitions of skill and athleticism mixed with equal measures of average play. Catch the right five minutes, and if you knew nothing else about the N.B.A., you would swear he was the greatest player on earth. Watch the wrong quarter or half, and you wouldn’t remember his name.

The gift establishes an endowment to expand and enhance the museum’s collection of European art, primarily of the Renaissance and Baroque eras."

It wasn’t until he paired Christopher Cuomo, the former ABC anchor he hired in January, with a young Washington correspondent named Kate Bolduan that he thought he had a perfect match.
 
On Thursday, in something of a surprise, Mr. Zucker named Ms. Bolduan the co-host of CNN’s forthcoming morning show, which has attracted considerable interest in the television business this year, given Mr. Zucker’s past life as a former producer of NBC’s “Today” show."

Held in June at nine locations around New York, it will feature a range of jazz and pop artists, including the saxophonist Wayne Shorter, the flamenco star Buika and the blues singer Buddy Guy.
 
The inaugural Blue Note Jazz Festival, in 2011, arrived at a time of transition for the summer jazz festival landscape in New York. From the start it seemed to be rushing to fill a void left by the JVC Jazz Festival (which had changed sponsors, becoming the CareFusion Jazz Festival, in its final year). The first two Blue Note festivals were strongly club-centered — its organizers own the Blue Note jazz club, the Highline Ballroom and the B.B. King Blues Club and Grill — and the occasional larger concert was generally cast in the JVC mold."

But in the case of a seminal prog-rock record that deals with the nature of time (and the slowing-down thereof), we’ll forgive Tom Stoppard if his unique effort to celebrate this milestone doesn’t actually arrive until the summer. 
 
Mr. Stoppard, the celebrated playwright of “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead” and “The Coast of Utopia” and a screenwriter of “Shakespeare in Love,” among many other works, has written a new play for British radio that will mark the 40 years since “The Dark Side of the Moon” was released in March 1973, The Guardian reported .

But the survey found a surprising bump in an out-of-the-way place: the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, opened in late 2011 in Bentonville, Ark., by the Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton, brought in 565,488 visitors in its first full year, more than double the number the museum expected.

But its 2012 number – 218,558 visitors – mostly reflects a return, after its blockbuster “Art in the Streets” show in 2011 (which drew more than 200,000 visitors), to the kind of attendance it has seen for most of the past decade."

2013-03-30T00:00:00Z,"COLAVITO--William (Bill), aged 95, died at home on March 28, 2013, after a life committed to making the world a better, fairer place for working people. Born in 1917, one of eight children of immigrant parents, he was forced to leave high school to support his family during the Great Depression, despite receiving a full scholarship to Cooper Union. He worked in an iron shop at 17 and helped to organize a trade union, Local 455 of the International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers. He became its president in 1943 before serving in the US Army in the Pacific during WWII. He returned to leadership after the war but in 1948 was pushed out of the union during the McCarthyist struggles of that era. In 1960, he led a rank-and-file movement to retake the helm of the union, and served as President from 1964 to 2007. His successes included establishing the first racially integrated apprentice program in the building trades, and insuring that American workers were employed for the rehabilitation of the Statue of Liberty in 1984. He was a force in progressive politics, from labor organizing during the Great Depression, to marching in the civil rights and anti-war movements to fighting to keep industrial work in New York. In 2004, he received the Craftsmanship and Civic Leadership Award from the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen. Having developed a great love of literature, Bill often said the best thing the union achieved was the 40-hour week, allowing him to go to the library. He was predeceased by Rose Colavito, his wife of 68 years, in 2010. He is survived by his sons, William and Joseph, their spouses Ronni and Deana, his sister Mary and brother Rocky, as well as four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Visitation Monday 2-4 and 7-9pm at Beecher Flooks Funeral Home, Inc., Pleasantville, NY, where funeral services will be held Tuesday 2pm. Interment private. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be sent in his name to Spinal Cord Injury Project, 604 Allison Road, D-251, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854."

Her first marriage to David Sill Burt, which ended in divorce, produced four children. She is predeceased by two of these children, Marcy Burt Butz and James Jackson Burt.

Eleanor was a photographer and writer, who worked with the noted photographer Margaret Bourke-White. Throughout her life she cultivated a talent for capturing the magnificent in the mundane. Her photographs have been exhibited at the Greenwich New York Library and other venues, but it was through the way she lived in the present and her devotion to relationships, family and friends, that she fully expressed her generosity of spirit, strength of character and extraordinary capacity for resilience.

2013-03-31T00:00:00Z,"The people at Vice nudge their version of a media empire a bit closer to the mainstream when “VICE,” a newsmagazine with what its creators hope is attitude, has its premiere on Friday night on HBO. The program certainly has a lofty view of itself. “The world is changing,” the introductory voice-over says. “No one knows where it’s going, but we’ll be there, uncovering the news, culture and politics that expose the absurdity of the modern condition.” 
 
The absurdity of the modern condition, of course, is not that hard to recognize, and the reports that constitute the first installment aren’t exactly exploring new territory. One involves political violence in the Philippines , which has been covered by mainstream outlets for years. Another focuses on the Taliban’s use of children as suicide bombers, something that groups like Human Rights Watch have been calling attention to for some time."

The guidelines, for passengers on cruise ships, even ones registered in foreign countries, are modeled on those in the airline passenger bill of rights that is currently law. They include access to backup generators, staff members traed in emergency and evacuation procedures, and full refunds for cruises abruptly canceled because of mechanical failures, plus three other guidelines."

Although a move might stem the club’s big financial losses, it could cause other problems. If the team relocates to Quebec, the league’s carefully constructed realignment plan would be scuttled. When asked Friday if the league had a Plan B in case the team moved, Bill Daly, the deputy commissioner, responded by e-mail: “No contingencies have been made. We are planning on the Coyotes being in Phoenix next year.”"

2013-03-31T00:00:00Z,"Last month, researchers at University College London made public a database that describes in illuminating detail one of the largest government bailouts in modern history. In 1833, Britain paid 20 million pounds to compensate 3,000 Caribbean slaveholders for the emancipation of their slaves. The payments constituted about 40 percent of total governmental expenditures that year. Conversation about the database in Britain centered on the recipients of these reparations for slaveholders, among them the ancestors of George Orwell, Graham Greene and David Cameron.
 
Apart from a few hundred slaveholders in the District of Columbia, no one in the United States received such compensation for the loss of their human property. According to Abraham Lincoln, at least, the cost of emancipation in the United States was to be reckoned in blood. In his Second Inaugural Address, Lincoln said he feared God would will the war to continue “until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword.”"

2013-03-31T00:00:00Z,"Remember the old days, when the contemporary classical music scene in New York was divided into opposed camps, uptown and downtown? Happily, that is fast becoming a dim memory thanks to a détente forged by intrepid new-music groups like Alarm Will Sound , which will perform a characteristically boundless mix of new and recent pieces at Zankel Hall on Saturday night.
 
It’s not just that the conductor Alan Pierson and his band of virtuosos disregard the schism between uptown complexity and downtown eclecticism, but that they’ve always seen through the purported dichotomy. The program includes “Big Spinoff” by the formidable modernist Charles Wuorinen, who has always had his funky side, and “increase” by David Lang , a downtowner and a founder of Bang on a Can who hardly avoids rigor in this insistently percolating work."

2013-03-31T00:00:00Z,"MANDELSTAM--Gloria Messinger, 83, of Manhattan and North Salem, NY, died on March 26, 2013, after a brave battle against a fierce enemy, cancer. Her life ended as it had always been lived: Gloria was strong, uncomplaining, and ceaselessly focused on others. To the end she inspired family, friends, and doctors alike with her grace. Gloria was born on November 28, 1929 in New York City. She was raised in the Bronx. An impassioned Yankees fan who learned from her father to keep a box-score as a child, she attended public school and graduated from William Howard Taft High School. She went on to Smith College (where no Taft graduate had ever before matriculated). At Smith her academic record earned her a place at Yale Law School -- in an era when legal education was still a male preserve -- and in the autumn of 1951 Gloria began her legal studies. She fell in love with the law -- and with her future husband, Charles Lawrence Mandelstam. As befits two intellectuals, they met at Yale's Sterling Law Library. Gloria took her legal diploma into the working world in the summer of 1954. She received many job offers from law firms... to work as a secretary. One organization -- and one alone -- asked her to join its ranks as a lawyer: The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). The country's leading music copyright society, ASCAP became the only place Gloria ever worked. For 39 years she devoted herself to the organization she loved, serving as a staff attorney, assistant general counsel, and, eventually, managing director for 12 years -- the first and only woman in ASCAP's history to hold its top position. Intellectual property and copyright law presented Gloria with endless, welcome challenges. In the United States and in negotiations world-wide, Gloria brought passion and expertise to the mission of defending the rights of the creators of music, from Sting to Stravinsky to George Gershwin to Stevie Wonder. After retiring from ASCAP in 1993, Gloria kept one hand in the law by becoming an arbitrator who specialized in copyright cases. She also gave her time to non-profit organizations, serving on the boards of directors of the Yale Law School Fund; the Theatre for a New Audience; and the Brooklyn Philharmonic. In addition, she was a member of the board of directors of the Dreyfus Mutual Funds. More than for her estimable professional accomplishments, Gloria was revered for her human qualities: kindness, generosity, and a readiness to help family, friends, and colleagues. She was unselfish and modest. She had a lively sense of humor and could talk with pop-music celebrities and city bus drivers with equal ease. She had an unerring sense of style and elegance. Among Gloria's greatest joys were travel, theatre, food, and wine. She came to know Paris almost as a second home, and enjoyed few things as much as wandering its lesser-traveled byways and discovering a spectacular cheese shop in the company of her beloved husband. In 1970, together with several American friends, Gloria and Charles bought an interest in a Cote Rotie wine vineyard in France's Rhone Valley that went on to win numerous awards. Closer to home, Gloria's love of the land found full expression in her deep attachment to her weekend home in North Salem, NY. To preserve North Salem's natural beauty, Gloria and Charles were founding members of the North Salem Open Land Foundation (which Charles served pro bono as general counsel for three decades). Gloria was deeply loved by Charles, her husband of 50 years and soulmate (who died in 2007); her daughter Emily Mandelstam; her son Peter Mandelstam; her son-in-law Paul Engelmayer; her daughter-in-law Dawn Drzal; her grandchildren Caroline Engelmayer, William Engelmayer, and Andrew Mandelstam; and the many friends who adored her. At the end of her life Gloria was blessed to be surrounded by her family and the many loving friends whose visits brought laughter and respite. She was especially grateful for the extended gatherings with her beloved law-school roommate, Zipporah Wiseman, who traveled from Texas, and Zipporah's husband Fred Wiseman, who came from France, to be by her side. Like Charles, Gloria will be missed by scores of dear and admiring friends. Gloria's family wishes to acknowledge the extraordinary care that she received from the staff at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Doctors, nurses, members of the janitorial staff -- everyone there was kind and compassionate. The medical treatment Gloria received was outstanding. Gloria's family would also like to thank the four angels who saw Gloria through hospice care at home. Burial will be private. Gloria's life will be celebrated at a gathering on Friday, May 10, 2013 at 6:30pm at the Yale Club (50 Vanderbilt Avenue in New York City). No RSVP is necessary as we honor a remarkable woman. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Theatre for a New Audience or the North Salem Open Land Foundation."

2013-03-31T00:00:00Z,"When I heard that a musical about Imelda Marcos was in the making, the first thing I wondered was, how many shoes will be onstage? Or maybe the whole show take place inside a shoe. So I was surprised to read in Vogue that David Byrne, the former Talking Heads singer who wrote the lyrics and composed the songs with Fatboy Slim, makes no mention of footwear in the musical.  
 
Directed by Alex Timbers (“Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” ), “Here Lies Love” seems to be aiming not so much for knowingly mocking the former Philippine first lady as for recounting her rise and fall in an immersive staging. Like ‘The Donkey Show,” the production does not have a traditional stage and will take place amid the audience members at the Public Theater. Audience members are free to dance to the songs if they would like. The musical takes its title from what Ms. Marcos, who liked going to nightclubs, once asked to be inscribed on her tombstone."
2013-03-31T00:00:00Z,"With “The Weimar Touch,” the Museum of Modern Art continues a collaboration with the Deutsche Kinemathek of Berlin that began with “Weimar Cinema, 1919-1933: Daydreams and Nightmares.” 
 
The first week of this eclectic series, which considers the diasporic influence of Weimar cinema, includes “Viktor und Viktoria” (1933) and Edgar G. Ulmer’s richly strange “Black Cat,” a hit for Universal in 1934. “The Black Cat” stars Bela Lugosi as a slightly demented Hungarian psychiatrist just out of a prison camp and Boris Karloff as his enemy, a more than slightly demented Austrian architect. (Bedtime reading: “The Rites of Lucifer.”) Karloff has built his dream house in the Carpathians, and what a house! Above ground it’s all sleek if somewhat sinister Art Deco, but below lies a darker vision of the modern: a bunker littered with embalmed corpses where satanic rites are performed and presented in echt Expressionist style (claustrophobic angles, a jutting set, distended shadows). With its talk of prison camps and hidden mass graves and that house — a veneer of civilization over a roiling id of a basement — the movie seems full of ominous European portent.

He was born, reared and educated in Washington, DC. During WW II he was stationed at the United States embassies in Santiago, Chile, and in Montevideo, Uruguay, where he became fluent in Spanish. In 1946 he joined Coca-Cola Export Corporation and was assigned to Germany as a Technical Observer. The following year he was transferred to Buenos Aires, Argentina, subsequently serving in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he learned Portuguese, and then Lima, Peru, as manager of the Andean Region. In 1962 Don was elected a Vice President of The Coca-Cola Export Corporation. In 1967 he was appointed manager of the Western European Area and lived in Brussels, Belgium, then in Paris, France. He retired in 1976 to finally live in his favorite city, New York. Paris was his second favorite city where he owned an apartment on Avenue George V with a fabulous view of the Tour Eiffel. Soon after World War II, in July 1946, his only brother, Vincent Ambrose Sisler, who served as a submarine commander in the Pacific, was killed in an automobile accident, leaving three small daughters. Don was a loving, caring uncle to his nieces and their families throughout his life. He took great pleasure in showing his family, friends and visitors from abroad the wonders of New York City. He was a great supporter of the performing arts, especially the Metropolitan Opera, where he was an Advisory Director, and underwrote ten of its PBS telecasts. Putting on his tux and striding across Central Park from his home on 5th Ave to the Met was a great joy for him. He was a wonderful raconteur, with a terrific sense of humor and an infectious laugh. His joie de vivre set an example for his family and friends. Charming, kind and caring to everyone, he was a gentleman of the old school an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life. He is survived by his nieces, Anne Sisler Latta and Tonia Sisler, nephew Dr. Adrian Sherman, great-nephews Jeffrey Latta and Michael Jacobs, great-niece Katherine Jacobs, and great-great nephew, Holden Latta."

2013-03-31T00:00:00Z,"On the habit of referring to people who are neither lead singers in rock bands nor galvanizing entertainers as “superstars” and “rock stars”: It has gone too far. A cursory search of the Internet reveals that people and things referred to in the media as “rock stars” include Rand Paul, the archbishop of Canterbury, the Samsung Galaxy S 4 smartphone, the Swedish mystery writer Camilla Lackberg and Pope John Paul II. Clearly, it’s high time we bought the term a watch and retired it. 
 
The problem is not just overuse. It’s the callous exceptionalism it not only condones but also celebrates. In a recent Times article about exploited interns, for instance, the author of a book on intern exploitation referred to the “rock-star professions” — those that expect free labor in exchange for a brief bask in the aura. Similarly, when Marissa Mayer is referred to as a “superstar” in a New York magazine profile, the label is intended to free her, in part, from the burden of empathizing with fellow humans."

2013-03-31T00:00:00Z,"WINSON--Abbie. Died peacefully with her daughters at her side on March 26th, 2013. She was 87. Abbie Winson was born on January 1, 1926 to Bertha and Norton Franks in Pittsburgh, moving to Philadelphia, then to the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City. Abbie's vast and varied early education included Music and Art High, the Arts Students League, Queens College, and the Sorbonne in Paris where she studied medicine, shifting her interests to anatomy and medical illustration. She spoke fluent and nuanced French. She studied painting with Vaclav Vytlacil and Hans Hoffmann in New York and was greatly influenced by the modernists and abstract expressionists, but developed her own dynamic and calligraphic style. Abbie was always a progenitor in her intellectual, artistic, and personal pursuits. She did mixed-media paintings before the term was coined. She learned typesetting from Sy Winson, another pioneer in a new field with whom she had three children and eventually married. She then got a pair of master's degrees, one in Fine Arts, the other in an emerging category, Special Education. She taught Art, Science, Math, and learning disabled children. She worked at grade schools, high schools and in Universities. She became involved with computer graphics in its infancy, on early model mainframe computers, working with systems so complex that Abbie became the traveling worldwide user guide. Primarily, Abbie loved to paint and returned often to large acrylic canvases and watercolors with collage. She has exhibited in group and solo shows in New York City with much acclaim. In her 70's she took up Chinese calligraphy and the Mandarin language. In her 80's she frequently travelled to the south of France to paint, collaborated with small press magazines on cover art for poetry books and projected her paintings over dancers and acrobats as part of the Nouveau Cirque movement. Abbie managed to live life as a persistent scholar, an innovative painter, a woman of enormous wit and charm, a femme fatale, and truly one of the great original thinkers of her time. She is survived by her daughters Suzi Winson of New York, Julie Winson of New Mexico and her granddaughter Isabel Winson-Sagan. Her son Robert, husband Sy, and her siblings Julian Franks and Doris Goldman predeceased her. Abbie will have a year-long posthumous retrospective of 70 years of work at a new gallery which is being developed to honor her, Art and Circuses, in Long Island City, NY.

The piece is set to poetry and music by Ivor Cutler (1923-2006), a Scottish poet, humorist, songwriter and actor (he appeared with the Beatles in their film “Magical Mystery Tour” in 1967). Known for unconventional behavior as well as offbeat verse, Cutler would ride everywhere on his bicycle in his plus fours, handing passers-by stickers with goofy phrases on them. He advised recipients, for example, to “Kindly disregard” and “To remove this label take it off.” He loved playing games with his name, telling people that he collected ivory cutlery.

2013-03-31T00:00:00Z,"What does photography even mean anymore as the 21st century deepens and we find ourselves overwhelmed by a flood of images, both still and video? Maybe the Museum of Modern Art show “XL: 19 New Acquisitions in Photography,” which opens on May 10, can give us a clue or two. It’s meant to assess photography’s role in contemporary art — and maybe in our lives. The 19 artists include Yto Barrada, Robert Frank, Birgit Jürgenssen, Stephen Shore, Taryn Simon and Lynn Hershman Leeson, whose chromogenic color print “Roberta’s Construction Chart #2” (1976) is above.

2013-03-31T00:00:00Z,"Flipping through a recent issue of The New Yorker, I noticed an ad for a handsome-looking bag in brown tooled leather. What caught my eye was the low-key design and dark hue but also the brand: the King Ranch of Texas.
 
The King Ranch is something of legend — one of the largest in the United States (825,000 acres, mainly in South Texas and Florida), and privately held since it was started in 1853 by Richard King and Gideon Lewis. It produces beef, pecans, citrus, sod — and, to my surprise, handbags. Rose Morales, general manager of the King Ranch Saddle Shop, said the ranch began making saddles for customers in 1867, when people admired Captain King’s tack. The first King Ranch handbag, La Bolsa, was made about 40 years ago, she said."
2013-03-31T00:00:00Z,"An old friend and mentor of mine, Ernan McMullin , was a philosopher of science widely respected in his discipline.  He was also a Catholic priest.  I don’t know how many times fellow philosophers at professional meetings drew me aside and asked, “Does Ernan really believe that stuff?”  (He did.) Amid all the serious and generally respectful coverage of the papal resignation and the election of a new pope, I often detect an undertone of this same puzzlement.  Can reflective and honest intellectuals actually believe that stuff?
 
Here I sketch my reasons for answering “yes.”  What I offer is neither apologetics aimed at converting others nor merely personal testimony.  Without claiming to speak for others, I try to articulate a position that I expect many fellow Catholics will find congenial and that non-Catholics (even those who reject all religion) may recognize as an intellectually respectable stance.  Easter is the traditional time for Christians to reaffirm their faith.  I want to show that we can do this without renouncing reason."

2013-03-31T00:00:00Z,"Tens of thousands of co-op and condominium owners across New York City are facing a tax increase this year after the recent tweak of tax-abatement regulations. 
 
On Jan. 30, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed into law a bill passed by the New York State Legislature amending a property tax break for residential co-ops and condos. These buildings have relied on the abatement for over 15 years to help offset a disparity in the tax burden between their units and single-, two- and three-family homes. Before the law changed, the abatement was at least 17.5 percent and applied to nearly all owners in qualified properties. The new legislation allows owners to claim the tax break only on a primary residence. Pieds-à-terre, or units held solely in a trust or by a limited-liability company, no longer qualify."

And the society is making sure that the annual Mocca Arts Festival , or Mocca Fest, now in its 12th incarnation, will be held on Saturday and Sunday at the 69th Regiment Armory at Lexington Avenue and 26th Street. If a few weeks without a fair has left you feeling out of sorts, immersion in the planet’s most popular art form could be the cure, and more. 
 
Instead of art dealers with fancy booths, some 300 casually attired artists, small (and a few large) publishers of comics and graphic novels, and students will display their efforts on tables. The majority will be artists, some of whom self-publish in print or on the Internet, with some Europeans in their ranks. With luck, a good sense of the thriving, not-so-underground underground comics scene — home to some of the best drawing anywhere — will be had by all.

To combat and correct stressed-out skin, Kiehl’s introduced an exclusive service and product duo: the Stress Minimizing Hydrating Facial and Skin Rescuer Daily Hydrator. The facial quickly squashes the visible effects of stress – think blotchiness, redness and flare-ups – through deep cleansing, gentle exfoliation, and a unique treatment infused with oxygen, which promotes circulation and clarity. The fragrance-free and quick-absorbing moisturizer, fortified with a potent blend of classic and innovative ingredients, lets you continue the good work at home.

If you find these sentences annoying, you are not alone. Each contains an example of nominalization: a word we are used to encountering as a verb or adjective that has been transmuted into a noun. Many of us dislike reading or hearing clusters of such nouns, and associate them with legalese, bureaucracy, corporate jive, advertising or the more hollow kinds of academic prose .

Her first marriage to David Sill Burt, which ended in divorce, produced four children. She is predeceased by two of these children, Marcy Burt Butz and James Jackson Burt.

A memorial will be held for Eleanor on April 6th at 2pm at the Harvard Club, 35 West 44th Street, New York City.

2013-04-01T00:00:00Z,"A Tony Bennett concert recording long presumed to be lost will be released on May 28. The album, “Bennett & Brubeck: The White House Sessions, Live 1962” (RPM/Columbia/Legacy), documents a performance by Mr. Bennett, above, and the pianist Dave Brubeck, above right, at the Sylvan Theater, on the grounds of the Washington Monument. Organized by the Kennedy administration as a token of gratitude for the corps of college students who had taken summer internships in the capital, the concert took place on Aug. 28, 1962. It featured separate sets by Mr. Bennett, who had just landed a hit with “I Left My Heart in San Francisco,” and the Brubeck quartet, one of the most popular jazz groups in the country. As an impromptu finale Mr. Bennett joined members of the quartet for four songs. One of those, a bossa nova version of “That Old Black Magic,” has appeared on some compilation albums. But the full concert, which lasted roughly an hour, languished unheard in the Sony vaults until its discovery in December, not long after Brubeck’s death at 91 . During his 60-year recording career, Mr. Bennett, 86, has collaborated with a number of leading jazz musicians, including the pianist Bill Evans and the Count Basie Orchestra. But after the concert in Washington, he and Brubeck didn’t perform together until the 2009 Newport Jazz Festival . Mr. Bennett is scheduled to make his next New York City appearance on Oct. 11 at Radio City Music Hall."

Bill Lohr, 84, beloved husband, father, grandfather, and man of many accomplishments, died Thursday, March 28, 2013, at home after a brief illness, surrounded by his immediate family. A native of Jamaica, Queens, NY, he was the son of Charles Henry Lohr Jr. and Margaret Louise Ruch Lohr. Bill attended Xavier High School and Queens College in Manhattan and Villanova University (biology,1952); he did graduate studies at Georgetown University (medicine; bioethics), and Northwestern University (research methods). In 1953, he became a member of Holy Cross Abbey (Cistercian Order of the Strict Observance [Trappists]) and was ordained in 1961; he also earned a Ph.L. in Philosophy at the Gregorian University, Rome (1963; ""The Notion of God in Henri Bergson""). In 1964-1967, he co-founded and directed an experimental religious community at 100 Acres Monastery, New Boston, NH, and taught at St. Anselm College, Manchester, NH, and St. Xavier's, Chicago, IL. From the late 1960s, Bill spent much of his career in health research and administration, mainly in US Public Health Service agencies (National Center for Health Services Research, especially in emergency medical services; Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Services and Resources Administration). Upon retirement from federal service in 1996, he joined the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and worked with the North Carolina Institute of Medicine. Bill's many talents included woodworking and furniture making; homebuilding skills from architectural drawing to plumbing and electrical wiring; photography, drawing, and watercolors; and gourmet cooking. As a youth, he was an avid bicycle racer. He will be greatly remembered for his wonderful sense of humor and myriad puns and stories. His abiding passion for history led him to deep knowledge of many topics, especially the Civil War and World War II; his delight in travel led him to Europe, Great Britain, Ireland, Australia, Canada, Alaska, and Australia. He loved the Blue Ridge Mountains, the High Country and the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and the Pacific Northwest, especially Mt. Rainier. Bill's devotion to family was deep and enduring. He is survived by his wife of 34 years, Kathleen N. Lohr; sons Sam (Debbie) Lohr; Lee (Connie Williams) Lohr; Christopher (Terri) Williams; Michael (Kristyn) Williams; and daughter Kirsten Lohr. He is also survived by his treasured grandchildren, Celia Lohr, Ian Williams-Lohr, Christopher Williams, David Williams, Luke Williams; Ryan Williams; Grant Hillick; Kaelyn Hillick, and Delaney Williams. He will be greatly missed by his brothers Charles and Andrew Lohr, sister-in-law Patricia Lohr, sisters Barbara Frey and Joan Ann Sweeney, and his many nieces and nephews. The family will receive friends on Monday, April 1, from 7-9pm, at Walker's Funeral Home, 120 W. Franklin Street, Chapel Hill, NC 27516.

2013-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Merton D. Simpson, the painter and influential collector of African art, was buried on Saturday in his hometown, Charleston, S.C., three weeks after his death at 84. The delay stemmed from bitter infighting among his family, friends and a court-appointed guardian. 
 
Although Mr. Simpson left a vast collection of art that some have estimated to be worth millions, the family said it did not have the resources to pay for a proper burial. His eldest son, Merton Simpson Jr., sent an e-mail blast after his father’s death on March 9, asking for contributions to a burial fund and setting up a PayPal account to accept donations. He had accused Ann Pinciss Berman, a guardian who had been given control of his father’s affairs during the last year of his life, of refusing to authorize sufficient funding for a burial. Ms. Berman, who said that only $3,000 was available for funeral, credited the Artists’ Fellowship, a New York-based charitable foundation that provides financial assistance to artists and their families, with offering an emergency grant of $7,200 to pay for a grave site and burial in a Catholic cemetery chosen by Merton Simpson Jr. (The Fellowship said that after Ms. Berman told it of a private donation, the grant was adjusted to $5,750.)"

The agreement, for a 26-month contract, ends the strike called on March 13 that forced the cancellation of orchestra appearances at Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center.
 
As if to emphasize an orchestra’s broad reach in the community, in a news release the San Francisco Symphony described the concerts that can now go forward this week: free performances for schoolchildren, a Music for Families concert, a regular performance of Handel and Mozart works conducted by the maestro Bernard Labadie, a chamber music performance and a workshop for amateur musicians. The musicians and the orchestra’s board must still ratify the agreement, which the orchestra called tentative. The terms were not released. The labor dispute centered on salaries."

2013-04-02T00:00:00Z,"MTV has suspended production on its reality series “Buckwild” in the wake of news that one of its most popular cast members, Shain Gandee, was found dead on Monday. Details about Mr. Gandee’s death remained unclear on Monday, though several news reports said he had been discovered along with two other men, one of them his uncle, in an all-terrain vehicle near his home in Sissonville, W.Va. 
 
CBS News reported that the men were last seen at 3 a.m. Sunday in a bar and had told other patrons that they intended to do off-road driving. In the “Buckwild” series off-road driving, which the characters called “mudding,” was central to several of the episodes. The show, which chronicled the daily adventures of a group of young adults from rural West Virginia , had been called “Appalachian Jersey Shore” by some reviewers."

The flip side is that the four teams that remain have all played exceptionally well, often dominating their opponents.
 
Louisville won its first four games by an average of 22 points — the same margin by which it beat Duke on Sunday. Syracuse has won by 20 points, on average. Michigan’s margin of victory has averaged 16 points, despite the close call against Kansas. Even Wichita State, which has a chance to become the most poorly seeded team ever to win the tournament (and probably the least likely, statistically), has won its games by an average of 11 points."

Bill Lohr, 84, beloved husband, father, grandfather, and man of many accomplishments, died Thursday, March 28, 2013, at home after a brief illness, surrounded by his immediate family. A native of Jamaica, Queens, NY, he was the son of Charles Henry Lohr Jr. and Margaret Louise Ruch Lohr. Bill attended Xavier High School and Queens College in Manhattan and Villanova University (biology,1952); he did graduate studies at Georgetown University (medicine; bioethics), and Northwestern University (research methods). In 1953, he became a member of Holy Cross Abbey (Cistercian Order of the Strict Observance [Trappists]) and was ordained in 1961; he also earned a Ph.L. in Philosophy at the Gregorian University, Rome (1963; ""The Notion of God in Henri Bergson""). In 1964-1967, he co-founded and directed an experimental religious community at 100 Acres Monastery, New Boston, NH, and taught at St. Anselm College, Manchester, NH, and St. Xavier's, Chicago, IL. From the late 1960s, Bill spent much of his career in health research and administration, mainly in US Public Health Service agencies (National Center for Health Services Research, especially in emergency medical services; Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Services and Resources Administration). Upon retirement from federal service in 1996, he joined the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and worked with the North Carolina Institute of Medicine. Bill's many talents included woodworking and furniture making; homebuilding skills from architectural drawing to plumbing and electrical wiring; photography, drawing, and watercolors; and gourmet cooking. As a youth, he was an avid bicycle racer. He will be greatly remembered for his wonderful sense of humor and myriad puns and stories. His abiding passion for history led him to deep knowledge of many topics, especially the Civil War and World War II; his delight in travel led him to Europe, Great Britain, Ireland, Australia, Canada, Alaska, and Australia. He loved the Blue Ridge Mountains, the High Country and the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and the Pacific Northwest, especially Mt. Rainier. Bill's devotion to family was deep and enduring. He is survived by his wife of 34 years, Kathleen N. Lohr; sons Sam (Debbie) Lohr; Lee (Connie Williams) Lohr; Christopher (Terri) Williams; Michael (Kristyn) Williams; and daughter Kirsten Lohr.

2013-04-03T00:00:00Z,"Would you pay a director tens of millions for fantastic performance? Welcome to the newest trend in activist investing: hedge funds paying their nominees to a company’s board as if they were chief executives.
 
The latest examples can be found in two prominent proxy fights. In the first, Paul Singer’s Elliott Management has acquired about $800 million in stock of the Hess Corporation , the integrated oil company. The hedge fund has nominated five directors to the 14-member Hess board and is agitating for change, arguing that the company has substantially underperformed its peers by 460 percent over the last 17 years."

Following a long and complicated illness, Mrs. Barbara Piasecka Johnson passed away on April 1, 2013. A long-time resident of the Principality of Monaco, Mrs. Barbara Piasecka Johnson was born in Staniewicze, Poland in 1937. Having obtained the Bachelor-cum-Master of Arts degree in art history from the University of Wroclaw, she immigrated to the United States via Rome in 1968. In 1971, Barbara Piasecka married J. Seward Johnson, Sr., son of the founder of Johnson & Johnson. Throughout her life, Mrs. Johnson continued her numerous charitable, philanthropic, art-related, and business activities in which she was always deeply and personally involved. Among others, in 1990, she offered to make a multimillion dollar investment in the financially troubled Gdansk Shipyard, the birthplace of Solidarity. The largest public exhibition of her art that Mrs. Johnson organized, Opus Sacrum, was staged at the Royal Castle of Warsaw, Poland in 1990 and in Liechtenstein in 1991. Currently, a selection of paintings and other objects from Mrs. Johnson's Collection is on display at the Musee de la Chapelle de la Visitation in Monaco as well as at the National Museum of Poland in Poznan. By special arrangement, selected paintings are on occasion loaned to museums worldwide. Mrs. Johnson conducted her charitable activities through the Barbara Piasecka Johnson Foundation, which was established in 1974. The Foundation reaches out to the needy worldwide, however, since Mrs. Johnson's native Poland was always very close to her heart, The Foundation--in a large measure-- assists students and professionals from Poland in continuing their studies in the United States. Over the years, Mrs. Johnson also extended significant support to the Solidarity movement, the victims of martial law in Poland, various nursing homes, homes for single mothers, selected health care facilities, and a number of other important humanitarian projects. Mrs. Johnson always emphasized that she assisted the weak, the sick, and the poor simply because they needed help, and she was in the position to offer them a helping hand. For her selfless charitable work Mrs. Johnson's was recognized with many prestigious awards. During the last years of her life, Mrs. Johnson focused on a program of assistance to children and young adults with autism. Mrs. Johnson donated to the Foundation her extensive collection of paintings by Polish masters and other works of art, with all proceeds from its sale being designated to finance a long-range program to increase awareness and understanding of autism and to create a center of excellence in early autism intervention in Poland that will give autistic children the chance for normal lives. As part of this mission, the Foundation established The Institute for Child Development (Instytut Wspomagania Rozwoju Dziecka) in Gdansk, Poland (www.iwrd.pl)--a non-profit organization, which now offers world-class science-based therapy to children with autism and assistance to their families, conducts scientific studies of autism therapy, and offers training for professionals specializing in autism. The Institute is modeled on and closely cooperates with the Princeton Child Development Institute in the United States, a world leader in the field. She was an amazing woman and a genuinely remarkable human being who will be sorely missed by her family and friends. In lieu of flowers, donations to the Barbara Piasecka Johnson Foundation can be sent to 4519 Province Line Road, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA."

While only 25 percent of Broadway shows ever turn a profit, this “Cat” was initially seen as a likely moneymaker given the star billing of Ms. Johansson, who had proven herself on Broadway in the 2010 revival of “A View From the Bridge” (for which she won a Tony Award) and seemed a natural fit as the sexy, fierce Maggie. The producers were so confident that they provided Ms. Johansson a star salary minimum of $40,000 a week."

Martin, it will soon be time to put down your remote control and pick up your pen (or get behind your computer keyboard), because HBO will have need for more of your narrative content. The cable network said on Tuesday that it had officially ordered a fourth season of “Game of Thrones,” its epic fantasy series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss , and adapted from Mr. Martin’s best-selling “Song of Ice and Fire” novels. This announcement comes two days after the third-season premiere of “Game of Thrones,” which set ratings records for that series , drawing 4.4 million viewers first episode and exceeding the 4.2 million viewers who watched the initial broadcast of its second-season finale last June. HBO said that “Game of Thrones” had an average gross audience (including showings on the network as well as plays on DVRs and digital services like HBO Go) of 11.6 million viewers in Season 2.
 
“A Dance With Dragons,” the fifth novel in what Mr. Martin plans to be a seven-book cycle, was released in 2011, while the HBO series has begun to tell the story of the third novel, “A Storm of Swords.” In other words, this latest “Game of Thrones” renewal should make life interesting for all involved."

The vote came in a deeply divided Capitol packed with angry and frustrated gun owners who arrived in buses and vans carrying signs reading “Connecticut the Un-Constitution State,” “N.R.A.

A refugee from Nazi Germany, she worked in 1934 at the Club Heinrich Heine in Paris as a volunteer to help political refugees, married her husband, Max, in 1935, and emigrated with him to the United States in 1937, eternally grateful to her adopted land for the opportunity to begin life again. She was a devoted daughter, who, through force of will and with the help of John Foster Dulles, Congressman Sol Blum, and Averill Harriman, got her parents released from internment camps in Vichy France. Always concerned about those less fortunate, she tutored disadvantaged children, volunteered at the Institute for International Education, worked for Selfhelp aiding Holocaust survivors much younger than she, and annually provided for the transportation of refugees to benefit concerts. Predeceased by her husband, Max, she is survived by her children, Roger H. Hull and Cathy M. Hull, son-in-law Neil Janovic, three grandchildren, Roberto F. Hull, Lincoln M.

As long as people are willing to pay to see them, why shouldn’t they continue?
 
A legend like Ms. Stritch, who is moving to Birmingham, Mich., to be near her nephews and nieces, has earned her adorers. In New York’s theatrical-cabaret axis, teeming with larger-than-life personalities, Ms. Stritch is one of the most formidable. Like Carol Channing and Liza Minnelli she epitomizes traditional show business brass and resilience: a “give it all you’ve got” dedication to entertaining. Everyone in the room was keenly aware that this might be the last hurrah of a blazing, cranky, funny stage personality who is, in a word, irreplaceable."

Grimm, N. Ellen Eifert, Laurie Steelsmith, Susan Wilmot, John Moorhead, James Moorhead, Dean Grimm, Tana Aurland, Tara Grimm, Jill Aurland., and many great nephews and great nieces. Jack was born July 7, 1922 in Dayton, OH to Helen Aurland Grimm and John E Grimm, Jr. His family moved to the New York area where he attended Scarsdale High School. Jack graduated from Dartmouth College in 1944, and The Amos Tuck School of Business. He attended Midshipman School at Northwestern University, Chicago and served in the U.S. Navy as Navigator, First Lieutenant, and Executive Officer, from 1942 to 1946. After his naval service, Jack began his career in the training program at Macy's. Later, he had the idea to make a recording of General Douglas Macarthur's' speech to Congress with the oft quoted phrase, ""Old soldiers never die, they just fade away"". He sold the record to department stores, including Macy's. The recording became the largest selling record for a two-day period, in Macy's history. Life Magazine ran a feature article with the headline, ""Amateur Scoops Record Industry"". With this success, he was hired by Lever Brothers and then by Sterling Drug, becoming a corporate vice president. In 1961, he accepted a position as a corporate vice president at the Colgate-Palmolive Co. where he worked for 24 years, retiring in 1984. In 1985 he founded Midbrook, Inc., a business consulting firm. He resided in Southampton, NY, and had been a resident of New York City for over 50 years. He was a member of Gypsy Trail Club in Carmel, NY, The Meadow Club and Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, Southampton, NY, The Racquet and Tennis Club in New York City, and The Lost Tree Club in North Palm Beach, FL. Jack was active in business and philanthropic endeavors, serving as President and Chairman of Madison Square Boys and Girls Club of New York City, Vice President of the Board, and Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee of The Southampton Hospital, and a former member of the Skin Cancer Foundation Board. He also co-authored ""My One Big Break"", a book of inspiring stories of successful business and professional leaders.

John was born in 1935 in Tulsa, Oklahoma to Russell E. and Frances Young and grew up in Casper, Wyoming where he was graduated from Natrona County High School in 1952. John went on to receive his undergraduate degree at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) and law degree magna cum laude in 1959 from Harvard Law School where he was a member of the Law Review. He spent most of the year following graduation from law school traveling the world on a Sheldon Traveling Fellowship from Harvard. Upon his return, John joined the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore in New York where he became a partner on January 1, 1968 and had a diverse corporate practice, principally in the areas of securities offerings and private financings, both domestic and international. John was a recognized expert in representing underwriters and issuers in public debt and equity offerings, as well as institutional investors in railroad equipment financings. He headed Cravath's Paris office in 1971-1973 and its London office in 1990-1995, when he retired from the Firm. John served as a trustee of the Brearley School and the National Young Arts Foundation and was chairman of the Royal Oak Foundation, the United States arm of the National Trust of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a conservation foundation, among his many charitable endeavors. John read avidly and widely. He loved travel, classical music and art. In retirement, John took up boating and with his wife Mary and many friends cruised the Erie Canal, the Florida Keys and the Intracoastal Waterway on his boat ""Mobius."" John was also a life-long progressive, beginning with his support, while a young man, for Adlai Stevenson and ending with his joy at being able to witness the election of Barack Obama. John was an extraordinarily generous man who cared deeply about his friends and family. In addition to his wife of 46 years, Mary, he is survived by his daughter Cynthia Young (George Eberstadt) and her daughters Esme and Maya, his daughter Abigail Young (Jonathan Moses), and her daughters Charlotte and Eleanor, and his sister-in-law Joan Nason. We will miss him deeply. Donations in John's memory may be made to the Mt. Sinai Visiting Doctor's Service, which provided him such compassionate care, or the Metropolitan Museum of Art or Museum of Modern Art, both of which John frequently visited in his later years taking part in their wonderful programs for people suffering from illnesses such as his.

In the spring of 2014, the theater will mount “Too Much Sun,” a new play by Nicky Silver (“The Lyons”), with direction by Mark Brokaw. Run dates and casting were not announced for either show.
 
“The Landing,” to be directed by Walter Bobbie, is the first collaboration between Mr. Kander, who with the lyricist Fred Ebb wrote the musicals “Chicago” and “Cabaret,” and Mr. Pierce, whose play “Slowgirl” was the inaugural production at Lincoln Center Theater’s new Claire Tow Theater last year. “The Landing” is Mr. Pierce’s debut as lyricist and book writer. Consisting of three musical tales of love and obsession, the show returns to the Vineyard for a full production after having a developmental production there last year. The Vineyard’s relationship with Mr. Kander dates to 1987, when it produced a revival of “Flora the Red Menace,” which had a book by George Abbott and Robert Russell, music by Mr. Kander and lyrics by Mr. Ebb. In 2010, the Vineyard produced the premiere of the Kander and Ebb musical “The Scottsboro Boys,” which transferred to Broadway."

For the first time since Iran and the six powers restarted their dialogue a year ago after a long lapse, North Korea, which had held similar talks in the 1990s that collapsed in betrayal and mistrust, is simultaneously demonstrating an outcome that Iran may find enviable, nonproliferation experts said. North Korea’s arsenal of nuclear weapons, however small, has nonetheless emboldened it to challenge the United States and other nuclear-armed powers, which have responded with caution and — from North Korea’s vantage point — some degree of respect."

2013-04-07T00:00:00Z,"A little pocket of Los Angeles County tucked into the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains reflects a crucial facet of suburban life. There’s tiny, wealthy Bradbury, a town that prides itself on having one of the richest ZIP codes in Los Angeles, where a house is on the market for $68.8 million. A couple of miles to the east is Azusa. This modest suburb is more than two-thirds Latino, a town of working families whose incomes and home values are a sliver of the wealth nearby.
 
These towns represent extremes of social inequality, but in Los Angeles and other areas, they reflect a defining pattern of contemporary suburban life. Nationwide, rich and poor neighborhoods like these house a growing proportion of Americans, up to 31 percent compared with 15 percent in 1970, according to a recent study by Sean F. Reardon and Kendra Bischoff. Meanwhile, iconic middle-income suburbs are shrinking in numbers and prospects."

John was born in 1935 in Tulsa, Oklahoma to Russell E. and Frances Young and grew up in Casper, Wyoming where he was graduated from Natrona County High School in 1952. John went on to receive his undergraduate degree at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) and law degree magna cum laude in 1959 from Harvard Law School where he was a member of the Law Review. He spent most of the year following graduation from law school traveling the world on a Sheldon Traveling Fellowship from Harvard. Upon his return, John joined the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore in New York where he became a partner on January 1, 1968 and had a diverse corporate practice, principally in the areas of securities offerings and private financings, both domestic and international. John was a recognized expert in representing underwriters and issuers in public debt and equity offerings, as well as institutional investors in railroad equipment financings. He headed Cravath's Paris office in 1971-1973 and its London office in 1990-1995, when he retired from the Firm. John served as a trustee of the Brearley School and the National Young Arts Foundation and was chairman of the Royal Oak Foundation, the United States arm of the National Trust of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a conservation foundation, among his many charitable endeavors. John read avidly and widely. He loved travel, classical music and art. In retirement, John took up boating and with his wife Mary and many friends cruised the Erie Canal, the Florida Keys and the Intracoastal Waterway on his boat ""Mobius."" John was also a life-long progressive, beginning with his support, while a young man, for Adlai Stevenson and ending with his joy at being able to witness the election of Barack Obama. John was an extraordinarily generous man who cared deeply about his friends and family. In addition to his wife of 46 years, Mary, he is survived by his daughter Cynthia Young (George Eberstadt) and her daughters Esme and Maya, his daughter Abigail Young (Jonathan Moses), and her daughters Charlotte and Eleanor, and his sister-in-law Joan Nason. We will miss him deeply. Donations in John's memory may be made to the Mt. Sinai Visiting Doctor's Service, which provided him such compassionate care, or the Metropolitan Museum of Art or Museum of Modern Art, both of which John frequently visited in his later years taking part in their wonderful programs for people suffering from illnesses such as his. A memorial service will take place on Tuesday, April 9 at 11am at The Church of the Heavenly Rest in Manhattan."

2013-04-07T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (13) DEFIANT REQUIEM: VOICES OF RESISTANCE (2012) In 1944 a chorus of 60 inmates at the Terezin concentration camp in Czechoslovakia performed Verdi’s Requiem, led by the conductor Raphael Schächter and accompanied by a single piano, for senior Nazi officers and members of the International Red Cross. (Above, a re-enactment of the performance.) The men and women were singing what they dared not say, reimagining the Catholic work’s Latin text — which promises divine judgment against evil — as a condemnation of their captors. This documentary, in honor of Holocaust Remembrance Day, follows the conductor Murry Sidlin as, 60 years later, he realizes his dream of bringing his chorus and orchestra to Terezin to honor Mr. Schächter and others who were imprisoned.

2013-04-07T00:00:00Z,"SCHWAB--Hermann C. Hermann C. Schwab, known as ""Gus"" to many, died April 1, 2013 peaceably at his apartment in Manhattan at the age of 93 after a full life. Born on January 8, 1920 to Hermann C. and Ruth Bliss Schwab, he is survived by his wife of 58 years, Meteer, his sister Anne Bleeker Corcos, his children Henry Schwab, Lesley Forman, and Margery Weekes from his prior marriage of 12 years to Lesley Ripley, and his children George Schwab and Tatine Kimmick, as well as thirteen grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Sadly he was predeceased by his son Stuart Schwab in 2005. Mr. Schwab graduated from St. Mark's School in 1937 and Yale College in 1941 and served in France during WWII as a second lieutenant. After the war he became a nationally ranked doubles squash player, playing with John Humes until 1969. Mr. Schwab served in several positions at Hanover Bank and then Empire Trust Company from 1946 to 1967. In 1967 he joined the Schroder Trust Company, later becoming an officer and director of Schroder Capital Management and Schroder Capital Funds, and of various Schroder mutual funds. He retired from Schroder in 1998 and was named Director Emeritus. He served as the Mayor of the Village of Oyster Bay Cove from 1973-1985 and village trustee from 1965-1998. He was a trustee of St. Luke's Hospital from 1969-1999, as well as Treasurer for several years, and oversaw (with many others) its successful merger with Roosevelt Hospital in 1979. For his work at St. Luke's Hospital, he was honored with an appointment as a Knight of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem. Mr. Schwab also served as Trustee of Newstead Farm in Upperville, Virginia from 1974 until its dispersal sale in 1985. Newstead Farm was a thoroughbred horse breeding farm which sold its horses at the August Saratoga horse sales and raced its fillies under the tutelage of legendary trainer Woody Stephens. During his tenure, Newstead successfully raced Lareda, a multiple Grade 1 stakes race winner and Miss Oceana, who ran in the Breeders Cup after winning six Grade 1 stakes in two years, finishing as runner up for both American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly and Three-Year-Old Filly in 1983 and 1984. Mr. Schwab was previously a longtime member of the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club, Piping Rock Club, the Mill Reef Club (Antigua), and the Jester's Club (England); at his death he was a member of the Knickerbocker Club. An avid sailor, he sailed in the Newport to Bermuda race twelve times and on the New York Yacht Club Cruise twenty-one times. He traveled widely with his wife Meteer, both for work and for pleasure. We will remember him for his self-deprecating sense of humor. An avowed Anglophile, he charmed many with stories of his frequent visits to the United Kingdom and his many friends there. A connoisseur of Bordeaux red wine, and a home-schooled chef who loved giving dinner parties with Meteer, he shared his favorites liberally with many friends. A memorial service will be held at St. James Church, 865 Madison Avenue, NY, NY (between 71st and 72nd Street), on April 19 at 11:30am. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to St. Mark's School, Alumni Office, 25 Marlborough Road, Southborough, MA 01772 or St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital, c/o Continuum Health Partners, Inc., Development Department, 555 W. 57th Street, 18th Floor, NY NY 10019."

He arrived in the US in 1947 as a teenage survivor of Buchenwald and became an award-winning student at the Art Student's League where he studied with Ivan Olinsky and Byron Brown. His luminous paintings of nudes, geishas, clowns, rabbis and ordinary people were sold at the former Park South Gallery in the Carnegie Hall building. They are part of many private collections in the US and Europe. A book of his work was published by Soho gallery-owner Louis Meisel's Eminent Publications. With his beautifully drawn paintings of figures and faces, suffused with light and color, he steered away from the darkness and depravity he experienced as a child. He is survived by his widow, Keiko Miura Wasserberger, nephews and nieces, and many friends, including his former wife, Marleen Nienhuis.

The imbalance of power between the East and the stronger West in the N.B.A., other than at the top, is still a major factor.

A scholar athlete, John attended St. John's Prep on a baseball scholarship. As a senior, he was recruited by the minor league system of the St. Louis Browns (now Baltimore Orioles).

While there, he was a member of the Sigma Rho fraternity and sang in the glee club. After college, John served his country with pride as a member of the occupying forces following the Korean War. He was a First Lieutenant in the United States Marines. Upon returning from active duty, John began graduate school in the field of Education at Brooklyn College.

Now he who bestrides the world like a colossus has colonized modern Africa in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of “Julius Caesar,” which opens at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday. 
 
Gregory Doran’s high-adrenaline interpretation, set in a newly formed African dictatorship, is said to seethe most convincingly with portents, prophecies and a convulsive spirit of revolution.

John was born on October 28, 1929, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts to Helena (nee Coughlin) and S. John O'Herron. He attended the Cranwell School in Lenox Massachusetts as a day student, then graduated from Williams College in 1951. He later attended Harvard Business School, where he received his MBA in 1957. After college, Jonathan served briefly in the U.S. Navy, achieving the rank of Lieutenant JG. His professional career began at General Electric Company, followed by Buckeye Pipe Line Company where he rose to Executive Vice President. Crucial to his business career was his short time spent as Treasurer of Buckeye's parent company, the Penn Central Transportation Company. He moved to the position at the behest of Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Freres & Co., as Lazard led Penn Central through its well known 1970 bankruptcy. Hired by Lazard soon thereafter, John's business career is most remembered for his investment banking work there over forty years, most of the time as a Partner and Managing Director, positions that he never officially retired from. At Lazard, in addition to being involved in dozens of noteworthy mergers, acquisitions, and financings, he was known for always finding the time to serve as a mentor to many future investment bankers. He constantly stressed to them the importance of balancing work with their family life. His character stood out in the business community where he was held in universal high regard for his integrity, and his modest ""salt of the earth"" personality. His family, along with his many friends, were his greatest devotion. He was never happier than playing golf or dining with them at Woodway Country Club, in Connecticut or Woods Hole Golf Club on Cape Cod. Also, Jonathan was deeply committed to his faith and to giving to others who were less fortunate than he. Although his free time was scarce, his participation with the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York went beyond his formal role as Trustee and Chair of the Finance Committee. According to Executive Director Monsignor Kevin Sullivan, ""In addition to everything else, we loved John for his asking time and time again, what more was there that he could do."" John was a Trustee of the American Red Cross in Greater New York, Kolbe Cathedral High School in Bridgeport, CT, New York Medical College, St. Joseph Medical Center in Stamford CT, and the Inner-City Scholarship Fund of the Archdiocese of New York. He was also an integral member of The National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management. He was made a Knight of St. Gregory by Pope John Paul II in 2004. John also spent considerable time supporting education. He established two scholarship funds at Williams College (one under his mother's name) and a scholarship fund at Fordham University, where Shirley had been a Trustee. He spent 15 years as a Trustee, then as a Trustee Emeritus of Middlebury College, where he was secretly a supporter of the athletic teams, rivals to Williams. He and his family recently launched a new internship program for Middlebury students who commit to doing service for others. Also, out of deep gratitude for his children's and grandchildren's time at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, he established a scholarship fund and was a Trustee there for nine years. John is survived by his son Jonathan O'Herron Jr., his daughters Anne Burleigh (Jon Burleigh) and Sarah Casey (C. Alec Casey), 11 adoring and adored grandchildren, and his brother William J. O'Herron. John's wife of 48 years, Shirley, predeceased him in 2004. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held privately at St. John's Church in Darien, followed by interment at Spring Grove Cemetery. A Memorial Mass will be held at 11am on Wednesday, April 10 at St. Thomas More Church, 374 Middlesex Rd, Darien. The Rev. Gerald Blaszczak S.J. will officiate.

2013-04-07T00:00:00Z,"Guitar Heaven may be more a state of mind than an actual location, but it has precise coordinates Friday and next Saturday: Madison Square Garden, home to the third iteration of Eric Clapton’s Crossroads Guitar Festival. This benefit for the Crossroads Center, a rehabilitation facility established by Mr. Clapton in Antigua, will feature an imposing assemblage of elite guitarists, many hailing from the blues and blues-rock terrain that he calls home: B. B. King and Buddy Guy, Jeff Beck and Robert Cray, John Mayer and Jonny Lang. 
 
But there will also be emissaries from the lands of country (Vince Gill, Keith Urban), gospel (Robert Randolph), indie-folk (Citizen Cope), even jazz (John Scofield, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Earl Klugh). The Allman Brothers will be there, as will Los Lobos — and, taking what amounts to a victory lap, Gary Clark Jr., whose definitive breakout took place during the festival’s 2010 edition. Naturally, to ensure that any mortal can entertain visions of guitar-god stature, the arena will be crowded with interactive kiosks sponsored by the likes of Gibson and Fender.

2013-04-07T00:00:00Z,"In the wake of horrible family rows, short of leaving my father, my mother would do something that shook the foundations of my childhood. She would step into our living room and, spurred by rage, spite and last-ditch efforts to restore order in her life, she would single-handedly move all the furniture around. The sofa was relegated to the place held by an imposing bookcase. The bookcase would be shunted over to a corner that belonged to an unassuming cabinet, now demoted to another corner where it sat in the dark under the terrified gaze of two leather armchairs squatting in the maelstrom.
 
To the outside world my mother was furiously rearranging furniture. To those who knew better she was trying to take control and putting a new face to her life. Since she couldn’t change much of anything and had no intention of buying new furniture, perhaps she was just trying to give her life a new look. It was madness, but it taught me that if changing the layout of your problems doesn’t necessarily solve them, it does make living with them easier. It also taught me that what came in the wake of any change, however terrifying, couldn’t have been more thrilling."

2013-04-07T00:00:00Z,"Critics say that the painter John Singer Sargent owned a world-class talent but made bad decisions about what to do with it. Even so, for sheer technical bravura, his work is wonderful to behold, whether in oil or in watercolor, in which he was as skilled if not as soulful as Winslow Homer. For Sargent fans “John Singer Sargent Watercolors,” at the Brooklyn Museum, should be like heaven. The exhibition brings together 93 of his watercolors and 9 oil paintings from the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Both institutions acquired significant quantities of his work early on, the Brooklyn Museum from Sargent’s career debut show in New York in 1909 and the Boston museum from a solo show there in 1912. 
 
The beauty of Sargent’s watercolors is in how seemingly effortlessly yet exactly he captured outdoor light and complicated man-made and natural forms. In landscapes, close studies of fruit and flowers and portraits of women you see at once the supremely deft action of the brush and the illusions of a sun-drenched halcyon world that it conjures.

Volunteer work played a large role in Charlotte's life, from helping newcomers to San Francisco to preparing tax returns for low-income taxpayers in New York. Charlotte always said she led a lucky life. She survived near-fatal illnesses at ages 30, 51, and 64. As she said, she never expected to reach 50, let alone qualify for Medicare! Charlotte lived in San Francisco for 15 years, and she and Jim met there in 1967. After Jim's return to New York a year later, they stayed in touch. Little did she know how her family would expand after her move to New York in 1977. Both West Coast and East Coast families and friends brought much joy and laughter into her life. And it was Jim whose wit brought the most laughter. They married in 1992. In 1999, Charlotte and Jim spent a week in Ash with eight other Americans. When she made a pew cushion for the church, she embroidered the names of the Americans on the cushion. It was presented to the church on Easter Sunday 2001; that day was also Greek Easter and was an especially joyous one for Charlotte. Beginning in 1999, she honored her mother's memory with a scholarship at her California high school. She also led the efforts to create the school's alumni scholarship, reaching alumni through the Internet ""Charlotte's Web,"" indeed.

The French Department and the Center for French Civilization and Culture of New York University are deeply saddened by the death of our longtime colleague and friend, Professor Michel Beaujour, one of the most eminent figures in the field of French literature. In his 46 years in our department, Michel played a key role in bringing it to the nation's top rungs, and by co-founding our innovative Institute of French Studies, he helped open new directions for the study of French. His wise counsel, usually dosed with irony and wit, helped carry us forward and upward. No one worked harder with students and no professor was more appreciated by them than he. In recent years, his great academic contributions were complemented by his most generous support for fellowships. Michel Beaujour cannot be replaced in our department but his spirit and his intellectual legacy will remain with us. Our heartfelt condolences go to his dear wife, Elizabeth, to his son and daughter-in-law, Thomas and Maria McKenna, and to his family in France."

2013-04-07T00:00:00Z,"GRIMM--John E. ""Jack"" III, 90, a retired business executive, died peacefully at his home in North Palm Beach, FL, on March 31, 2013 with his loving wife, Ann R. Grimm, and his beloved dog Lily by his side. He is also survived by a sister, Nan M Freeman. He was preceded in death by brothers, C. Peter Grimm and Robert D. Grimm. He was a loving uncle to Carl H. Grimm, N. Ellen Eifert, Laurie Steelsmith, Susan Wilmot, John Moorhead, James Moorhead, Dean Grimm, Tana Aurland, Tara Grimm, Jill Aurland., and many great nephews and great nieces. Jack was born July 7, 1922 in Dayton, OH to Helen Aurland Grimm and John E Grimm, Jr. His family moved to the New York area where he attended Scarsdale High School. Jack graduated from Dartmouth College in 1944, and The Amos Tuck School of Business. He attended Midshipman School at Northwestern University, Chicago and served in the U.S. Navy as Navigator, First Lieutenant, and Executive Officer, from 1942 to 1946. After his naval service, Jack began his career in the training program at Macy's. Later, he had the idea to make a recording of General Douglas Macarthur's' speech to Congress with the oft quoted phrase, ""Old soldiers never die, they just fade away"". He sold the record to department stores, including Macy's. The recording became the largest selling record for a two-day period, in Macy's history. Life Magazine ran a feature article with the headline, ""Amateur Scoops Record Industry"". With this success, he was hired by Lever Brothers and then by Sterling Drug, becoming a corporate vice president. In 1961, he accepted a position as a corporate vice president at the Colgate-Palmolive Co. where he worked for 24 years, retiring in 1984. In 1985 he founded Midbrook, Inc., a business consulting firm. He resided in Southampton, NY, and had been a resident of New York City for over 50 years. He was a member of Gypsy Trail Club in Carmel, NY, The Meadow Club and Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, Southampton, NY, The Racquet and Tennis Club in New York City, and The Lost Tree Club in North Palm Beach, FL. Jack was active in business and philanthropic endeavors, serving as President and Chairman of Madison Square Boys and Girls Club of New York City, Vice President of the Board, and Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee of The Southampton Hospital, and a former member of the Skin Cancer Foundation Board. He also co-authored ""My One Big Break"", a book of inspiring stories of successful business and professional leaders. Jack was an avid golfer and tennis player and was considered by all who knew him as true gentleman. Above all, Jack shared his life with an incredible group of loyal friends. Funeral Services will be private. A celebration of Jack's life will be held at a later date. The family asks that remembrances in Jack's name be made to the Madison Square Boys and Girls Club of New York City, or The Southampton Hospital, Southampton, NY."
2013-04-07T00:00:00Z,"JOHNSON--Barbara Piasecka, a humanitarian, philanthropist, and collector of fine art. Following a long and complicated illness, Mrs. Barbara Piasecka Johnson passed away on April 1, 2013. A long-time resident of the Principality of Monaco, Mrs. Barbara Piasecka Johnson was born in Staniewicze, Poland in 1937. Having obtained the Bachelor-cum-Master of Arts degree in art history from the University of Wroclaw, she immigrated to the United States via Rome in 1968. In 1971, Barbara Piasecka married J. Seward Johnson, Sr., son of the founder of Johnson & Johnson. Throughout her life, Mrs. Johnson continued her numerous charitable, philanthropic, art-related, and business activities in which she was always deeply and personally involved. Among others, in 1990, she offered to make a multimillion dollar investment in the financially troubled Gdansk Shipyard, the birthplace of Solidarity. The largest public exhibition of her art that Mrs. Johnson organized, Opus Sacrum, was staged at the Royal Castle of Warsaw, Poland in 1990 and in Liechtenstein in 1991. Currently, a selection of paintings and other objects from Mrs. Johnson's Collection is on display at the Musee de la Chapelle de la Visitation in Monaco as well as at the National Museum of Poland in Poznan. By special arrangement, selected paintings are on occasion loaned to museums worldwide. Mrs. Johnson conducted her charitable activities through the Barbara Piasecka Johnson Foundation, which was established in 1974. The Foundation reaches out to the needy worldwide, however, since Mrs. Johnson's native Poland was always very close to her heart, The Foundation--in a large measure-- assists students and professionals from Poland in continuing their studies in the United States. Over the years, Mrs. Johnson also extended significant support to the Solidarity movement, the victims of martial law in Poland, various nursing homes, homes for single mothers, selected health care facilities, and a number of other important humanitarian projects. Mrs. Johnson always emphasized that she assisted the weak, the sick, and the poor simply because they needed help, and she was in the position to offer them a helping hand. For her selfless charitable work Mrs. Johnson's was recognized with many prestigious awards. During the last years of her life, Mrs. Johnson focused on a program of assistance to children and young adults with autism. Mrs. Johnson donated to the Foundation her extensive collection of paintings by Polish masters and other works of art, with all proceeds from its sale being designated to finance a long-range program to increase awareness and understanding of autism and to create a center of excellence in early autism intervention in Poland that will give autistic children the chance for normal lives. As part of this mission, the Foundation established The Institute for Child Development (Instytut Wspomagania Rozwoju Dziecka) in Gdansk, Poland (www.iwrd.pl)--a non-profit organization, which now offers world-class science-based therapy to children with autism and assistance to their families, conducts scientific studies of autism therapy, and offers training for professionals specializing in autism. The Institute is modeled on and closely cooperates with the Princeton Child Development Institute in the United States, a world leader in the field. She was an amazing woman and a genuinely remarkable human being who will be sorely missed by her family and friends. In lieu of flowers, donations to the Barbara Piasecka Johnson Foundation can be sent to 4519 Province Line Road, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA."

2013-04-07T00:00:00Z,"Angry Birds, the popular video game that involves catapulting birds at fortresses constructed by enemy pigs, now has a greater purpose than killing time at the checkout line. It’s the subject of a 4,485-square-foot exhibit at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida that is meant to teach children physics.
 
Though Angry Birds has inspired theme-park attractions like the one at Sarkanniemi Adventure Park in Tampere, Finland, the Kennedy Center exhibition, which opened last month, is the first attempt to extract some educational value out of the seemingly mindless game. “Angry Birds Space Encounter,” above, a collaboration between NASA and the game’s creator, Rovio Entertainment, features six interactive stations, including a laser-beam obstacle course set on the Red Planet and Eggsteroid slingshots that children can use to launch birds at evil pigs.

In his 46 years in our department, Michel played a key role in bringing it to the nation's top rungs, and by co-founding our innovative Institute of French Studies, he helped open new directions for the study of French. His wise counsel, usually dosed with irony and wit, helped carry us forward and upward. No one worked harder with students and no professor was more appreciated by them than he. In recent years, his great academic contributions were complemented by his most generous support for fellowships. Michel Beaujour cannot be replaced in our department but his spirit and his intellectual legacy will remain with us.

2013-04-08T00:00:00Z,"O'HERRON--Jonathan. Jonathan O'Herron, of Darien, Connecticut, and Woods Hole Massachusetts, passed away peacefully on April 4, 2013, after a short illness. John was born on October 28, 1929, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts to Helena (nee Coughlin) and S. John O'Herron. He attended the Cranwell School in Lenox Massachusetts as a day student, then graduated from Williams College in 1951. He later attended Harvard Business School, where he received his MBA in 1957. After college, Jonathan served briefly in the U.S. Navy, achieving the rank of Lieutenant JG. His professional career began at General Electric Company, followed by Buckeye Pipe Line Company where he rose to Executive Vice President. Crucial to his business career was his short time spent as Treasurer of Buckeye's parent company, the Penn Central Transportation Company. He moved to the position at the behest of Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Freres & Co., as Lazard led Penn Central through its well known 1970 bankruptcy. Hired by Lazard soon thereafter, John's business career is most remembered for his investment banking work there over forty years, most of the time as a Partner and Managing Director, positions that he never officially retired from. At Lazard, in addition to being involved in dozens of noteworthy mergers, acquisitions, and financings, he was known for always finding the time to serve as a mentor to many future investment bankers. He constantly stressed to them the importance of balancing work with their family life. His character stood out in the business community where he was held in universal high regard for his integrity, and his modest ""salt of the earth"" personality. His family, along with his many friends, were his greatest devotion. He was never happier than playing golf or dining with them at Woodway Country Club, in Connecticut or Woods Hole Golf Club on Cape Cod. Also, Jonathan was deeply committed to his faith and to giving to others who were less fortunate than he. Although his free time was scarce, his participation with the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York went beyond his formal role as Trustee and Chair of the Finance Committee. According to Executive Director Monsignor Kevin Sullivan, ""In addition to everything else, we loved John for his asking time and time again, what more was there that he could do."" John was a Trustee of the American Red Cross in Greater New York, Kolbe Cathedral High School in Bridgeport, CT, New York Medical College, St. Joseph Medical Center in Stamford CT, and the Inner-City Scholarship Fund of the Archdiocese of New York. He was also an integral member of The National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management. He was made a Knight of St. Gregory by Pope John Paul II in 2004. John also spent considerable time supporting education. He established two scholarship funds at Williams College (one under his mother's name) and a scholarship fund at Fordham University, where Shirley had been a Trustee. He spent 15 years as a Trustee, then as a Trustee Emeritus of Middlebury College, where he was secretly a supporter of the athletic teams, rivals to Williams. He and his family recently launched a new internship program for Middlebury students who commit to doing service for others. Also, out of deep gratitude for his children's and grandchildren's time at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, he established a scholarship fund and was a Trustee there for nine years. John is survived by his son Jonathan O'Herron Jr., his daughters Anne Burleigh (Jon Burleigh) and Sarah Casey (C. Alec Casey), 11 adoring and adored grandchildren, and his brother William J. O'Herron. John's wife of 48 years, Shirley, predeceased him in 2004. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held privately at St. John's Church in Darien, followed by interment at Spring Grove Cemetery. A Memorial Mass will be held at 11am on Wednesday, April 10 at St. Thomas More Church, 374 Middlesex Rd, Darien. The Rev. Gerald Blaszczak S.J. will officiate. In lieu of flowers, the family is asking that donations be made to: The O'Herron Family Foundation, PO Box 4816, Stamford, CT 06907."

That would be a surprising change: At the moment, girls 16 and younger must have a prescription to buy the morning-after pill, which helps prevent pregnancy after sexual intercourse. As a result, even though it is nonprescription for everyone else, even an older woman can buy it only at the pharmacy window, and she must show a valid ID and proof of age."

But that leaves a medical dictionary full of ailments that continue to plague people despite the best efforts of Big Pharma. Most are chronic health problems related to how Americans live, especially what we eat and drink, and don’t eat and drink, and how we move or don’t move. In our aging society, these ailments have pushed the annual cost of medical care into the trillions of dollars and threaten to break Medicare."

That did not stop the English-speaking press from trying to draw out of Guan all the ways he is like a typical teenager, as if there is such a thing.
 
Guan, who is in eighth grade, was asked at his press conference Monday if he has brought schoolwork along with him this week, and if so, which subject he is concentrating on. Guan paused to compose his thoughts, as he did before every answer, and then said, “Pretty much English the most. I’m learning English right now.”"

That network and its British sibling, the BBC, said on Monday that they would produce a television adaptation of Susanna Clarke ’s best-selling novel, “Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,” which would be shown as a mini-series in 2014.
 
Originally published in 2004, “Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell” is set in Britain in the early 1800s as the Napoleonic Wars are raging, and centers on two competing conjurers, Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange. Strange becomes Mr. Norrell’s pupil, and  they variously work with and against each other to restore magic to their world. (Ms. Clarke’s novel, which pays tribute to many 19th-century literary styles, also runs nearly 800 pages and includes some 200 footnotes.)"

2013-04-10T00:00:00Z,"TROY--Elizabeth Nichols. Elizabeth Nichols Troy, 68, passed away April 3, 2013 from the long term effects of the radiation therapy which had spared her life in 1969. Raised in Cold Spring Harbor, LI., and a four-decade resident of New Canaan, CT, she was a forty-three-year survivor of Hodgkin's Lymphoma and ten-year survivor of breast cancer. She emerged from extreme heart surgery in 2008 to provide us with five more years of her vibrant, loving self, now in the additional role of grandmother to two new adoring granddaughters. Libby, as she was known, grew up in Laurel Hollow, LI., where she was a tennis champion at the Cold Spring Harbor Beach Club, and crewed with her father in Atlantic races. She attended East Woods School in Oyster Bay and was a 1965 graduate of Smith College. In New York, she worked for Life magazine at Time, Inc.; Rock Resorts in public relations; and Reader's Digest as an editorial researcher. She was also a freelance writer and wrote reading-group guides for Random House. She was happy to give up full-time work when her daughter, Robin, was born in 1974. A lifelong devotee of literature, she was a founding and stalwart member of her beloved book group for more than thirty-five years. A direct descendant of William Floyd, signer of the Declaration of Independence, and a great-granddaughter of Cass Gilbert, architect of the Woolworth Building in New York City and the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., she was born to John Slocum Nichols and Jarvis Gilbert Nichols on August 26, 1944. She is survived by her husband of forty-two years, Richard Hershey Troy, her daughter Elizabeth D. ""Robin"" Troy, son-in-law Michael J. Stromberg, granddaughters Elizabeth Quinn and Augusta Reed Stromberg, and siblings John S. Nichols, Jr. of Providence, RI., Grosvenor G. Nichols of Sacramento, CA, and Sarah K. Nichols of Greenwich, CT. She was predeceased by her brother Floyd G. Nichols of Denver, CO. She was a member of the National Society of Colonial Dames and the Country Club of New Canaan and former member of the Cold Spring Harbor Beach Club in Long Island and the Colony Club of New York. To those of us who knew her well, she will always be our elegant, intelligent, giving partner, friend and mom, a fighter who lived with resilience and dignity and an acute awareness of the privilege of being alive. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, April 20th at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in New Canaan, CT at 11am."

But “Smoke-Filled Room,” which started to run on Monday on three cable television channels , has gained attention for its unusual provenance: it was financed by a group of political activists who are not affiliated with any candidate. The group, called NYC Is Not for Sale 2013 , is legally allowed to spend unlimited amounts on political advertising, as long as it does not coordinate its activity with a candidate. The group’s founders have pledged to spend more than $1 million on ads that attack Ms. Quinn — the first instance of a so-called independent expenditure in the 2013 mayor’s race."

2013-04-10T00:00:00Z,"Many people would simply pair beer with Melissa Clark’s rich coconut curry , a wise and sensible choice. Pilsner, Saison, Belgian white ales, India pale ales and any other tart, bracing brew would do nicely. But many wines would work surprisingly well, too. There are the versatile usuals, of course: Champagne, off-dry German rieslings, demi-sec Vouvrays, crisp sauvignon blancs. I think a good amontillado sherry would be delicious; assertive enough to cut through the richness of the coconut milk and reflect the sweet, spicy, herbal flavors.
 
How about a wild card? Red wine might not occur to you with chicken, coconut milk and the spicing, but many options would not be out of line. A dry Oregon pinot noir might work. A lively barbera from Alba or Asti would fit in, too. Best of all would be a fresh red from the Loire Valley, like a Chinon or Bourgueil, refreshing, stimulating and a beautiful color for contrast."

2013-04-10T00:00:00Z,"GUSHEE--Stephen Hale, priest, columnist, television moderator and devoted husband and father, died Saturday after a months-long battle with bladder cancer. He was 76. Steve lived a life with the throttle wide open, touching countless people through his engaging sermons and his thought-provoking columns. A fiercely independent thinker, he never shied away from controversial opinions and as a man of deep spirituality, he never feared sharing it. His family and many friends also knew a compassionate, loving man with a marvelous sense of humor. Steve was an ordained Episcopal priest for more than four decades, serving as senior associate rector at Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach from 1991-1994 and also assisting at Grace Episcopal Church in West Palm Beach. For 13 years before that, he was dean of Christ Church Cathedral in Hartford, Connecticut. He was rector of Trinity Church in Newtown, Connecticut, and served at St. Peter's Church in Cheshire, with his mentor and friend, Bishop Morgan Porteus. For five years, beginning in 1994, he was the religion writer for the Palm Beach Post and contributed a weekly opinion column, ""On Religion,"" until 2008. His column was distributed to hundreds of newspapers across the country by the Cox News Service. He and the papers that carried his work received thousands of laudatory letters, emails and telephone calls over the years. His columns attracted so much attention because of his passion and the simple clarity of his voice. He detested intolerance and hubris, and said so often and loudly. He was skeptical of fundamentalists. He strongly defended the right of women to become priests (""Oppressed women have men to thank."") He was an early advocate for gay rights, once condemning the expulsion of a student from a private school because he came out of the closet his senior year. And often, he was gentle, funny and enlightening (""A banquet is a better symbol of Christianity than a fish stick.'') For 13 years, until 2012, Steve was the moderator of ""Viewpoint"" on WPTV, the Miami PBS affiliate. The show, which has been airing for more than three decades, brings together religious leaders and scholars who delve into religious, moral and ethical topics. Stephen Hale Gushee was born in Detroit in 1936. At age 13, he boarded a train eastward, where he would spend the rest of his life. He attended Kent School, in Kent, CT., where he was on the rowing team and was captain of the football team. In 1953, he rowed in the Henley Royal Regatta in England, by far the best known race of its kind in the world. The trip helped fuel his interest in seeing more of the world and he became especially interested in the Mideast, where he would make many trips. He attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, on a U.S. Navy scholarship. Following graduation in 1958, he served for three years as a line officer aboard the USS Shelldrake, a minesweeper assigned to the Navy's Atlantic Fleet. Shortly after leaving the service, he enrolled in the Episcopal Theological School, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he received his master's of divinity degree. He was ordained in 1967. Over the years he also studied at St. George's College in Jerusalem, the Virginia Seminary in Alexandria, and the Hartford Seminary in Connecticut. Steve was one of the original members of the American Friends of the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem. He was a canon of St. Andrew's Cathedral, Aberdeen, Scotland, for 10 years and served as a member and, at times, director of a number of social service organizations and inner city agencies. He married Mary Coakley in 1996 and in his later years assisted her in the day-to-day operations of her women's fashion store in Palm Beach, Mildred Hoit. He is survived by his beloved wife, Mary. He was predeceased by his first wife, his college sweetheart, Anne Elizabeth Taylor. They had three children: Allison Gushee Molkenthin, Andrea Bordley Mayfield, and Gregory Hale Gushee. The extended Gushee family includes the spouses of his children, Steve Molkenthin, Jeff Mayfield and Sophia Gushee, and eight wonderful granddaughters, Allegra, Christina and Octavia Molkenthin; Anne Elizabeth and Katie Mayfield; and Taylor, Bordley and Sconset Gushee. He was predeceased by his oldest brother, Richard, and is survived by two brothers, Edward and John, sisters-in-law Marilyn, Kitty, and Sally, and numerous nieces and nephews. A funeral will be held at noon, April 13 at Bethesda-by-the-Sea, Palm Beach, Florida. The Gushee family will receive friends during a reception immediately following the service.

What was the East Village like in late 1967 and early 1968? In Sunday night’s season premiere of the period drama “Mad Men” on AMC, a subplot involving Betty Draper’s search for a runaway teenager takes her to the neighborhood, and though no street sign is shown, a character’s comment implies that it’s just off St. Marks Place. The block looks rather seedy, home to abandoned buildings, litter-strewn sidewalks and sketchy characters. In the background, someone scurries by carrying a television down the street. Was it looted?

He released a scathing rap aimed at those critics and suggested he had been falsely accused of breaking the law because of his friendship with President Obama.
 
The rapper mocked the two Miami Republicans — Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart — who demanded last week that the Treasury Department explain why the trip was licensed by the American government.

2013-04-12T00:00:00Z,"PAGE--Nancy Eaton, on April 1, 2013, of Washington, D,C passed away peacefully in her Georgetown home. Born in Detroit, MI on April 21st 1926 to Edward and Alice Cheetham. Later she was adopted by her mother's second husband, Wilbur Eaton of Bryan, OH. Nancy was raised in Swampscott, MA and attended Boston University. Soon after school she found clerical work with the Department of Defense in Washington DC. Her first duty station was on The Mall in the temporary office buildings that lined the reflecting pool between The Washington Monument and the Lincoln memorial. In 1947 Nancy was hired by the State Department and soon went to work in Tehran, Iran where her love affair with traveling and all aspects about the Middle East was born. It was in Tehran that she met her husband of 57 years, Robert Wesley Page. Nancy and Bob lived for over 15 years in the Middle East and the Netherlands with their children. Beirut, Lebanon was a special jewel to Nancy who forged a lifetime of friends there and would return to again and again. Once returning to the United States, Nancy raised her family in New York, Houston and for over two decades in Washington, DC. For many years Nancy and family spent summers in Little Compton, RI and most recently winters in Key West. Nancy was a brilliant conversationalist who embraced life with curiosity and humor. She was passionate and engaged in the creative arts, literature, politics and inspired her family in her passion. Nancy's sophistication and compassion captured the admiration and loyalties of the mighty and the meek, from laborers, to waiters, to professional athletes, to diplomats, foreign and domestic. Her respect for all cultures enabled her to be a bridge-builder in support of the many and varied interests and vocational excursions of her husband from whom she was inseparable, as well as for family and friends. She was a unique presence in countless lives, young and old, across the globe. To be with her was to truly enjoy life she will be deeply missed by many. Nancy is survived by three of her four children: David Page, Mark Page and Meg Page and three grandchildren; Keegan Page, Addie Page and Riley McIlvaine. Her eldest son, Robert Wesley Page Jr., passed away in 2007. Details on a celebration of Nancy's life will be provided at a later date."

Pechman, a judge in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, had already dropped Amazon from the case, and dismissed other claims.

After Ms. Hoang filed the suit in 2011, the Screen Actors Guild publicly criticized IMDB for its practice of posting performers’ ages.

Following her career onstage, Maria's role as a teacher and director was an inspiration for countless young dancers and her work will have a lasting impact for generations to come. The world of dance has lost a true giant, and she will be greatly missed. All of us at NYCB express our heartfelt condolences to Maria's sister Marjorie, daughter Elise Paschen, and her entire family."

It was a cool August morning on Cannon Beach during low tide.  We decided to look for sea stars (as starfish are called there).  After walking for about a mile from our hotel to the sea stacks, we found pools of water surrounding a rainbow of sea stars: purple, red and orange, their arms perfectly wrapped around each other as if to stay warm in the chilly Pacific.

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"Renault unveiled a striking blue concept car by Ross Lovegrove, a British furniture and product designer, at the Salone Internazionale del Mobile di Milano furniture show on Monday. The electric city car, dubbed the Twin’Z, has center opening doors and is dotted, outside and in, with hundreds of LEDs. The project was the idea of Laurens van den Acker, the Renault design director.
 
“The aim was to break down the boundaries between the world of an object whose calling is to be in movement – the automobile – and that of furniture,” Mr. Van den Acker said of Mr. Lovegrove’s involvement in the design. “There are numerous bridges between the work of Ross Lovegrove – which combines beauty and intelligence thanks to an approach inspired by the living, natural world – and the strategy we have been working on for three years now at Renault.”"

Like many of its peers, the 192-year-old Swiss institution offers an undergraduate degree in industrial design. But unlike many schools, it also has something called the Master of Advanced Studies in Design for Luxury and Craftsmanship, which was founded five years ago and has made a name for itself through its collaborations — with luxury goods companies like Baccarat, Christofle, Bernardaud and Audemars Piguet — that bring new ideas to old-line manufacturers.
 
Two years ago, a group of ÉCAL students caused a sensation during the Milan furniture fair with an exhibition of witty reimaginings of a Baccarat classic, the Harcourt crystal goblet. Last year, another group came up with a series of colorful, ornamented vases, one of which, Brick, has been produced in a limited edition by Baccarat, along with a juice-squeezer goblet from the Harcourt project. This year, students worked with Baccarat on a collection of table, wall and hanging lights that will make its debut this month during the Milan fair. Unlike previous projects, in which student designs might only be one-offs or limited editions, the lights are meant for production. ÉCAL’s director, Alexis Georgacopoulos, says, “They’re entrusting us with something that’s more commercial from the start.” Another vote of confidence is a pledge from the Swiss watch company Vacheron Constantin to sponsor the program for the next three years."

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"Some art books skyrocket in value just a few years after they’re published. How much cash is sitting on your coffee table?

 
After witnessing the staggering after-market success of “ Helmut Newton: Sumo ” — which cost $1,500 when it came out in 1999 and is now worth 10 times that much — the art publisher Taschen has invested in making more of its books good investments. The company’s gigantic limited-run “art editions,” many of which come with signed gelatin prints, are specifically designed to appreciate in value. Some, like Mario Testino’s 2010 book on Kate Moss — which had a $500 list price and currently resells for $2,000 — do this very quickly. But the value of more modest art and fashion books can grow exponentially in a short time, too. A 2002 retrospective on the Vogue creative director Grace Coddington , originally priced at $125, rocketed to $2,000 after the release of the 2009 documentary “The September Issue.”"

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"Sometimes, all you need is a sign. After clerking at a grocery store and touring as a musician for 11 years, Brian Girgus decided it was time for a life change and looking back, assessed what it would take: “I realized I should cut hair. I always did it anyways for girlfriends, myself or other friends.” He committed to working long nights after class and taking out a bank loan to finance barber school, until one incredible chance encounter with lady luck. “I went thrift shopping and tried on a coat,” Girgus said, “and in that coat found all of the money I needed for school, in cash.” On the first day of classes, he paid for his tuition in full.
 
Located on a hip strip of Sunset Boulevard, where Echo Park meets Silver Lake, the New California Barber Shop embodies quiet California cool. An oversize mural of white wind turbines set against the San Jacinto Mountains and a clear, bright blue sky, along with Girgus’s sweet pup, Shelley Long, warmly greet customers. The front door is always open, quite literally, and Girgus is ever present, working and accessible. “Hopefully people are as tired as I am of the owner of a place always being some rich guy that nobody ever knows or sees.” Sun-weathered wood and cactus plants add to the easygoing, lo-fi vibe. What you won’t see here are waxed mustaches and other tired clichés associated with all too many modern barbershops. “We’re comfortable with ourselves, have good personal style, and it brings that out in the people we help. We are not a man cave,” Girgus explains."

It’s fitting that a jeweler should live in a gem, and the Paris home of Marie-Hélène de Taillac, a penthouse apartment with views over the Parisian rooftops toward Saint-Sulpice, is a lovely one: simple, clean and understated, and in a constant dance with light. If you’ve ever dreamed of an Amélie-style garret sprinkled with a generous pinch of sophistication — and who hasn’t? — here it is, perched on the top floor of a building near de Taillac’s shop in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, complete with a terrace and climbing magnolias. “I love watching the clouds,” she says. “That is why I love this flat.

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"It’s not unusual to see a hipster tooling around Silver Lake or Williamsburg in a beat-up old Mercedes. What’s rarer is to find those 35-year-old sedans, coupes and wagons restored to mint condition. That’s the particular obsession of J. G. Francis (above right), who with the help of Sean Johnstun, founded Mercedes Motoring, a boutique restoration company based in Glendale, Calif.
 
Francis says he had an epiphany after buying a 1979 300SD for $700. “I’ve heard people say somebody should make a car that will last forever,” he says. “Mercedes did that 40 years ago.” The engineering may be superior — and that diesel engine still gets competitive gas mileage — but it’s the design that attracts many of the company’s clients. The classic colors, like mint green and China blue, and a boxy profile make these cars distinct from the S.U.V.’s and egg-shaped hybrids now crowding the roads. “I have never been drawn to things that are over the top,” Francis says. “I like things that are subtly amazing.” mercedesmotoring.com."

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"WHAT IS IT ABOUT TASTE? A sort of defensive look crosses many people’s faces when they hear the very word. If good taste is mentioned, often the reaction of sophisticates is a counterintuitive: “Oh, yuck.” And if bad, it often yields defiant admiration: “Well, I love a bit of bad taste, actually.” Do they? Don’t they really mean they desire something with guts? Gusto, after all, in Italian, means taste, goût to the French.
 
And yet, every continent, country and capital, is awash with bland beige, unrelieved by a lot of lifeless leather, a bit of black and a throw. And that’s not just the new breed of “modern” hotels, but apartments and homes as well, for people seem to want their living spaces to look exactly like the hotel, or spa, or friend’s house they just left. This dullness of “taste” is surely a watered-down version of those coolly elegant rooms that were so eye-opening decades ago. Think of the Mercer Hotel-ification of style: those dark brown wenge-wood bookcases are now the sine qua non of ubiquitous, bland modernity. Even an icon of great taste, like Cy Twombly’s house in Rome, has been the object of much dull, middle-of-the-road copycatting. Nowadays, the tedious sameness of so much modern architecture enhanced by a dash of classicism can only make such taste insipid."

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"There are essentially two kinds of actors: the ones who are seen and the ones who see. The ones who play characters and the ones who study people. The performers and the informers. 
 
Julianne Moore falls squarely into the latter, more rarefied, much, much smaller camp. Indeed, however unassumingly, she is its standard bearer. What makes her work so powerful, in films as diverse as “Far From Heaven” and “The Big Lebowski,” “Boogie Nights” and the forthcoming remake of “ Carrie ,” is that, for this actress, playing a role is not about sunbathing in admiration but about admiring the rest of us, in all of our varied subjectivities. For Moore, taking on the vocal inflections, the mannerisms, the emotional undercurrents and psychic thunderstorms of another human being is essentially just a way of seeing us all more deeply. She looks deeper into her characters, inhabits them more fully, loves them more completely and with less judgment than just about any actor out there. As a result, her best work has, in some small but undeniable way, managed not just to entertain but to elevate and ennoble the rest of us."

Now 74, she is retiring. Her last semester at Princeton — depicted as a campus plagued by evil in her new gilded-age Gothic, “The Accursed” — will be fall 2014. “I would have preferred not to retire,” she confessed in an e-mail interview. But she wanted to take an unpaid leave this term to teach at the University of California, Berkeley, where her husband is lecturing on neuroscience (she’ll also teach next spring at New York University). In exchange, she said, “I had to agree to retire within a few semesters.” Princeton would not elaborate.
 
MS. OATES ON RETIREMENT: I can understand that any institution leans toward phasing out more senior faculty, so that younger faculty can be hired, usually at lower salaries. This is all very transparent and sensible and it would be very wrong of me to have a principled complaint about it, though naturally I feel sad, and will miss Princeton terribly. One does have a sense of being ushered, not exactly forcibly, but firmly, in the direction of an exit door that, once you step through, will lock behind you as in a comical episode in “The Simpsons.”"
2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"FOR more than a decade, the University of Colorado, Boulder, hosted the country’s largest campus smokeout.

They would fill the air with a pungent haze of marijuana smoke, lighting up at 4:20 p.m. on the dot with potheads worldwide for what is known as 4/20.
 
Last year, the air smelled fishy. The university had sprayed fish-based fertilizer on the quad, cordoned it off with yellow police tape and closed the campus to outsiders. Only 300 to 400 congregated, facing police in SWAT gear. Cost: $130,000 (plus $100,000 for a concert aimed to distract). This year, the university will repeat its crackdown , though after discussions with student leaders, it will not fertilize."

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"In the history of painting Diego Velázquez had a seismic effect. Now real earthquakes are bringing one of his best portraits to the United States for the first time. On Tuesday the Metropolitan Museum of Art will open a single-painting exhibition of Velázquez’s “Portrait of Duke Francesco I d’Este ,” which practically drips with the hauteur of the Duke of Modena, who had come to Madrid in 1638 to secure political support and, in the process, became immortalized on canvas. The exhibition, which runs through July 14, is timed to celebrate the Met’s reinstallation of its European paintings galleries in May. But it has happened only because the Velázquez’s home, the Galleria Estense in Modena, which has one of the best small paintings collections in Italy, is still closed because of damage from the severe earthquakes that struck the region last year.
 
The painting is “a high-water mark in the history of Baroque portraiture,” as the Met describes it, and a potent demonstration of Velázquez’s contribution to international diplomacy as well as art. (212-535-7710, metmuseum.org .)"

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"An indulgent and elegant apartment on the 42nd floor of the Trump International Hotel and Tower, which was reconfigured to a two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath aerie from the original four bedrooms and six baths by the designer Jeffrey Bilhuber, sold for $16.25 million and was the most expensive sale of the week, according to city records.
 
The condominium, No. 42C at One Central Park West, had been listed last year at $19.9 million and sold after a reduction to $17.9 million; the monthly carrying charges are $12,531, and, as with most Trump properties, oodles of amenities are included with the privilege of ownership. The 4,415-square-foot residence, which has impressive views of Central Park, the Hudson River and the cityscape, sold for $5.04 million as a sponsor unit in 1997. After the owner enlisted Mr. Bilhuber to modernize and dramatize it, the property was featured in the May 2001 issue of Architectural Digest. Among other changes, he installed bamboo flooring in the foyer, created a private master suite with a limestone bath and separate dressing room, and designed an equally impressive guest suite with an elevated Japanese soaking tub made from black soapstone."

Once the residence of the royal family of Liechtenstein, the Baroque building was bombed during World War II and damaged further when an Allied aircraft crashed into its roof. Its four-year, $135 million face-lift restores the structure to its prewar glory, with a dramatic interior staircase, silk wall hangings and intricate parquet floors. The project was overseen by Hans-Adam II, the reigning prince of the tiny principality — who also owns another commodious palace just outside the city center, where he keeps his noted collection of Old Masters. While some of the revamped building will be marked off for the family’s private apartments, visitors will finally get a peek at many of its gilded Rococo interiors, not to mention the prince’s collection of Biedermeier and neo-Classical art and furnishings.

Branching out from her ballet roots and into less familiar physical territory (more fluidity in the spine, more weight into the ground), Ms. Whelan has teamed with four contemporary dancemakers — Kyle Abraham, Joshua Beamish, Brian Brooks and Alejandro Cerrudo — to create a collection of duets, which will have their premiere in full at Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival this summer. At the Guggenheim she performs excerpts from Mr. Beamish’s and Mr. Brooks’s contributions (partnered by the choreographers themselves), though all four men will be on hand for a conversation with Ella Baff, the Pillow’s executive and artistic director. Ms. Whelan also revisits a 2005 solo by the Chinese-born choreographer Shen Wei — his first work for point shoes.

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"Around 400 B.C., Socrates was brought to trial on charges of corrupting the youth of Athens and “impiety.” Presumably, however, people believed then as we do now, that Socrates’ real crime was being too clever and, not insignificantly, a royal pain to those in power or, as Plato put it, a gadfly. Just as a gadfly is an insect that could sting a horse and prod it into action, so too could Socrates sting the state. He challenged the moral values of his contemporaries and refused to go along with unjust demands of tyrants, often obstructing their plans when he could. Socrates thought his service to Athens should have earned him free dinners for life. He was given a cup of hemlock instead.
 
We have had gadflies among us ever since, but one contemporary breed in particular has come in for a rough time of late: the “hacktivist.” While none have yet been forced to drink hemlock, the state has come down on them with remarkable force. This is in large measure evidence of how poignant, and troubling, their message has been."

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"In 2011, immediately after Sean Brock opened the restaurant Husk in a restored Victorian house on Queen Street in Charleston, S.C., the young chef was hailed a savior of Southern cuisine. Brock had schooled himself in forgotten kitchen volumes like “The Carolina Housewife,” and revived strains of sesame and field peas that hadn’t been cultivated there for centuries. “If it wasn’t from the South, it wasn’t coming in the door,” he decreed. His reverence for antebellum ingredients easily could have produced a menu of heirloom dishes, a kind of reenactment restaurant. But that’s not what happened.
 
Instead Brock discovered a way to celebrate the South’s past and present at the same moment, even sometimes in the same dish. He found a guy brewing soy sauce in old bourbon barrels and concocted a “Kentuckyaki” glaze to brush over pig’s ears that had been boiled for hours, then deep-fried, then tucked, Korean style, into butter-lettuce wraps."

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"Three films by the Cambodian documentarian Rithy Panh — “The Land of the Wandering Souls,” “S21: The Khmer Rouge Death Machine” and “Duch, Master of the Forges of Hell” — constitute the heart of the Film Society of Lincoln Center’s series Old Ghosts, New Dreams: The Emerging Cambodian Cinema. Two of those directly explore the bitter legacy of the Khmer Rouge regime, which committed mass murder (as many as 1.8 million people) when it ruled the country in the 1970s.
 
In “S21” he brings two survivors along with former members of the Khmer Rouge to the former Tuol Sleng prison (code-named S21). Vann Nath, a painter who escaped the prison, confronts former Khmer Rouge guards who recount atrocities they committed when they were as young as 12."

Until Cyprien Gaillard came along, the “Monument to Joe Louis” in Detroit had about as much in common with Abu Simbel temples as the ancient Egyptian structures did with high-rises in the Bronx. But “Geographical Analogies” — a series of collages that the 32-year-old artist assembled over five years from 963 Polaroids — unites sacred pyramids, failed resorts, public toilets, marble caves, modernist buildings, classical columns and other anomalous artifacts of civilization as if they were estranged members of a single family extending across all time."

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"With her eye for the unusual, the ancient and the brightly colored, Irene Silvagni orchestrates her Provencal retreat into a wonderfully imperfect harmony.

 
“I like the imperfections of things,” Irene Silvagni declares. And to look at the rooms of her home in Provence — with their centuries-old stone floors, worn antique furniture covered with vintage textiles and picture frames without pictures, among other things — you know she means it. The rambling, 8,000-square-foot residence, parts of which date back to the 16th century, is a never-ending project for Silvagni, 71, a former fashion editor for French Vogue (and, more recently, a creative consultant for Yohji Yamamoto, and now for Giambattista Valli). She firmly believes that a house “should never be finished. When the house is finished, you die,” she says."
2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"To make a legendary room you have to have extreme conviction. The power decorator Juan Pablo Molyneux’s blue and white tiled vestibule at his 17th-century house in Paris, which he shares with his wife, Pilar, rates as epic. It’s a perfect example of the designer’s dedication to the vernacular of place, historical mastery and pure creative rapture.
 
Molyneux says he was ceramically inspired “by two famous examples of architecture.” One was a small pavilion at Versailles called the Trianon de Porcelaine, whose interior and exterior were covered in blue and white faience that existed for roughly 17 years. The second is a tiled palace in St. Petersburg built by a Russian Prince, Aleksandr Menshikov, in 1710."
2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"A FEW TIMES A YEAR, Nick Pologeorgis leaves his family’s business on West 29th Street to attend the fur auctions in Toronto, Seattle and St. Petersburg, the home of the Russian sable market. His father, Stanley, started Pologeorgis Furs in 1960; after Nick graduated from Boston University in 1984 with a degree in finance, he joined the firm. His sister, Joan, works on the production side. Lately, if there’s one thing Mr. Pologeorgis has noticed at the auctions, aside from rising prices (they have doubled in the last three years), it’s the number of Chinese bidders. No doubt the two are connected.
 
I first heard about Mr. Pologeorgis from Ralph Rucci a decade ago — like almost everyone in the industry, he calls him Nick — and I got the sense that he loves a challenge and will go to any length to accomplish it. He once made knitted sable pants for Mr. Rucci (the collector Iris Apfel owns them), and he did the camouflage furs for Michael Kors’s last show. His sister had a real time making them, he said, because each piece had to be cut and dyed and then assembled. “It was like a puzzle.”"

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"There’s something to be said for developing a signature style. In most areas of design it can be a great career move, but particularly in the field of architecture. Clients know what to come to you for, people know your buildings when they see them, and, as with Frank Gehry or Richard Meier, they cheer you on when you deliver the goods again and again.
 
In cinematic terms, if Renzo Piano, Gehry and Meier are the reigning Spielbergs of contemporary architecture, producing successful (or almost as successful) versions of an initial winning formula over and over, Rafael Moneo might be its Mike Leigh: highly talented and critically revered, but in the age of the star architect, in the United States, at least, we barely know his name. During a career of more than 40 years, the Madrid-based Moneo has produced buildings of startling quality, no two of which are alike. Working mainly in his native Spain, which has regarded him as something of a national hero since his National Museum of Roman Art in Mérida opened in 1986, Moneo has approached commissions with the goal of making architecture that is simultaneously an ornament to the Old World and a beacon of the new. His buildings are extremely site-specific, usually physically elegant and charged with experiential surprise, often in the plan or through internal manipulations of natural light. Always born of some well-considered relation to context, Moneo’s buildings are not objects meant to promote themselves, nor do they condescend."

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"How does an actress design her image? In our celebrity-obsessed culture, she usually dresses in the very latest fashion and has her photographs airbrushed into superhuman oblivion. Julianne Moore , while she indeed looks ravishing in films and on the red carpet, and even in her sweatpants at morning drop off (where I see her from time to time as our children attend the same school), is not such an actress. She is someone who rather pushes the boundaries in her acting in order to inhabit the characters she plays. For this issue she collaborated with the photographers Inez and Vinoodh and the makeup wizard Peter Philips, all artists in their own right, who seek to extend our way of seeing. Here they show us a more real, and even exaggerated side of Moore’s natural beauty. Freckled from birth (and not in a cute way, she explains in the piece), Moore’s face was sprinkled by Philips with even more spots. The resulting image, unlike most cover shots, isn’t retouched to perfection. The power comes from Moore’s striking and honest intensity, and from her scarcely made-up face, remarkable and beautiful at age 52.
 
Likewise, for the homes we often see in design magazines: perfectly appointed rooms, with electrical cords and all the clutter removed, and hardly any sense of the personalities of the owners shining through, so very unlike the way most people live. The former fashion editor Irene Silvagni’s house in the South of France is a romantic paean to patina and even decay. Claudio Luti, the C.E.O. of Kartell, cohabitates with modern, plastic furniture by the likes of Patricia Urquiola and Philippe Starck in his Milanese town house , amid a historically rich interior with references to other periods, in a way that recognizes that what is modern now is merely a moment in its continuum in the history of design. And the jewelry designer Marie-Hélène de Taillac’s tiny Parisian flat reflects her love of simple, well-made objects and the bright colors of gemstones, much like the beautiful pieces she designs."

Later she was adopted by her mother's second husband, Wilbur Eaton of Bryan, OH. Nancy was raised in Swampscott, MA and attended Boston University. Soon after school she found clerical work with the Department of Defense in Washington DC. Her first duty station was on The Mall in the temporary office buildings that lined the reflecting pool between The Washington Monument and the Lincoln memorial. In 1947 Nancy was hired by the State Department and soon went to work in Tehran, Iran where her love affair with traveling and all aspects about the Middle East was born. It was in Tehran that she met her husband of 57 years, Robert Wesley Page. Nancy and Bob lived for over 15 years in the Middle East and the Netherlands with their children. Beirut, Lebanon was a special jewel to Nancy who forged a lifetime of friends there and would return to again and again. Once returning to the United States, Nancy raised her family in New York, Houston and for over two decades in Washington, DC. For many years Nancy and family spent summers in Little Compton, RI and most recently winters in Key West. Nancy was a brilliant conversationalist who embraced life with curiosity and humor. She was passionate and engaged in the creative arts, literature, politics and inspired her family in her passion. Nancy's sophistication and compassion captured the admiration and loyalties of the mighty and the meek, from laborers, to waiters, to professional athletes, to diplomats, foreign and domestic. Her respect for all cultures enabled her to be a bridge-builder in support of the many and varied interests and vocational excursions of her husband from whom she was inseparable, as well as for family and friends. She was a unique presence in countless lives, young and old, across the globe. To be with her was to truly enjoy life she will be deeply missed by many. Nancy is survived by three of her four children: David Page, Mark Page and Meg Page and three grandchildren; Keegan Page, Addie Page and Riley McIlvaine. Her eldest son, Robert Wesley Page Jr., passed away in 2007. Details on a celebration of Nancy's life will be provided at a later date."

The models at Dior , bodices scattered with appliquéd petals and skirts ballooning with meadow flowers, moved through a spring garden, along a maze of topiaried box trees devised for the show by the Belgian landscape designer Martin Wirtz as an allusion to Raf Simons’s childhood garden and to Monsieur Dior’s rural retreat Le Moulin du Coudret. Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli at Valentino drew on the actual structures of the garden: suits and skirts were embroidered with designs of borders and parterres. Dresses and capes enclosed the models within the looping patterns of wrought ironwork. And at Chanel , the early-19th-century Romantic poets Goethe and Schiller, whose verses extol the worship of untamed nature, influenced Karl Lagerfeld . His girls emerged from the shadows of an enchanted wood specially constructed for the Grand Palais, blinking into the light like Shakespearean revelers exiled from a masque, feathers framing the shoulders of their almost courtly garb, bedraggled plumes askew in their hair."

2013-04-14T00:00:00Z,"By the time a poor child is 1 year old, she has most likely already fallen behind middle-class children in her ability to talk, understand and learn. The gap between poor children and wealthier ones widens each year, and by high school it has become a chasm. American attempts to close this gap in schools have largely failed, and a consensus is starting to build that these attempts must start long before school — before preschool, perhaps even before birth.
 
There is no consensus, however, about what form these attempts should take, because there is no consensus about the problem itself. What is it about poverty that limits a child’s ability to learn? Researchers have answered the question in different ways: Is it exposure to lead? Character issues like a lack of self-control or failure to think of future consequences? The effects of high levels of stress hormones? The lack of a culture of reading?"

Grand was the founder of The Inner Circle of Advocates, a group of plaintiffs' attorneys called by The National Law Journal, ""the elite of the plaintiffs' bar."" Grand was born in what was then the independent nation of Danzig in 1930. He came to New York City with his parents in 1939, just before the Nazis entered his homeland. After earning his undergraduate degree from New York University and his law degree from the University Of Arizona College Of Law in 1958, Grand entered the practice of law in Tucson. In 1972, Grand recovered a jury verdict of $3.5 million which was the largest ever received at the time for a single personal injury. Following the award, Grand brought together 11 prominent plaintiffs' lawyers from throughout the country to form The Inner Circle of Advocates. Grand said it was designed to be a ""think tank for the most qualified legal brain trust in the United States."" It was formed as an attempt to level the playing field between the average consumer and the enormous resources of the insurance industry, the auto industry, the tobacco industry, and the pharmaceutical industry, among others. The invitation-only group is currently limited to one hundred members, and has included such well known lawyers as Joe Jamail, John Edwards, Johnie Cochran, Moe Levine and Court of Appeals Justice, Jack Fuchsberg.

After forming The Inner Circle, Grand was named Honorary President of the Richard Grand Society, the premier association of personal injury attorneys in Great Britain. He also was a member of the International Society of Paraplegia and the British Academy of Forensic Sciences (Legal Section). Grand published numerous articles on case management and the presentation of traumatic injury. He was a member of the State Bar of Arizona and a certified specialist in injury and wrongful death litigation, Board of Legal Specialization of the State Bar of Arizona. Over the course of his life Grand received many honors from the University of Arizona including: Richard and Marcia Grand Alumnus of the Year Award, 2011; Distinguished Alumni Award, 2010; and Professional Achievement Award, 2002, an award given to a person who has attained prominence in his or her field.

Later she was adopted by her mother's second husband, Wilbur Eaton of Bryan, OH. Nancy was raised in Swampscott, MA and attended Boston University. Soon after school she found clerical work with the Department of Defense in Washington DC. Her first duty station was on The Mall in the temporary office buildings that lined the reflecting pool between The Washington Monument and the Lincoln memorial. In 1947 Nancy was hired by the State Department and soon went to work in Tehran, Iran where her love affair with traveling and all aspects about the Middle East was born. It was in Tehran that she met her husband of 57 years, Robert Wesley Page. Nancy and Bob lived for over 15 years in the Middle East and the Netherlands with their children. Beirut, Lebanon was a special jewel to Nancy who forged a lifetime of friends there and would return to again and again. Once returning to the United States, Nancy raised her family in New York, Houston and for over two decades in Washington, DC. For many years Nancy and family spent summers in Little Compton, RI and most recently winters in Key West. Nancy was a brilliant conversationalist who embraced life with curiosity and humor. She was passionate and engaged in the creative arts, literature, politics and inspired her family in her passion. Nancy's sophistication and compassion captured the admiration and loyalties of the mighty and the meek, from laborers, to waiters, to professional athletes, to diplomats, foreign and domestic. Her respect for all cultures enabled her to be a bridge-builder in support of the many and varied interests and vocational excursions of her husband from whom she was inseparable, as well as for family and friends. She was a unique presence in countless lives, young and old, across the globe. To be with her was to truly enjoy life she will be deeply missed by many. Nancy is survived by three of her four children: David Page, Mark Page and Meg Page and three grandchildren; Keegan Page, Addie Page and Riley McIlvaine. Her eldest son, Robert Wesley Page Jr., passed away in 2007. Details on a celebration of Nancy's life will be provided at a later date."

It is one of the lasting images in literature, but that hasn’t kept book designers from trying to outdo it. The scholar and F. Scott Fitzgerald biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli spent his adult life stockpiling those efforts ­— pulpy paperbacks, fancy slip-covers, French-flapped foreign editions — and today his trove is not only one of the world’s most complete collections but also an illuminating cross section of 83 years of book design. Now housed at the University of South Carolina, the collection is worth several million dollars but Bruccoli, who died in 2008, claimed he was never motivated by money. “You don’t buy books as an investment,” he said. “You buy them because it gives you pleasure to read them, to touch them . . . to see them on shelves.”

In a little over a day, the video for the song, “Gentleman,” attracted more than 32 million views on YouTube after it had its premiere on Saturday during a concert in Seoul. 
 
The video features Psy, whose real name is Park Jae-sang, acting in his established ungentlemanly manner until he gets a taste of his own medicine from Son Ga-In, another K-pop star who is a member of the group Brown Eyed Girls. It also features a signature dance move to complement the horse-riding maneuver made popular by “Gangnam Style,” which has surpassed 1.5 billion views on YouTube since its debut in July."
2013-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Hollywood was predictably shocked over the weekend to find that a well-reviewed drama succeeded at the box office even though it was aimed at geriatric moviegoers (industry definition: anyone over the age of 25). The Jackie Robinson biopic “42” was a strong No. 1 at North American movie theaters, taking in about $27.3 million, according to its distributor, Warner Brothers. Legendary Entertainment spent a relatively modest $38 million to make the film, which performed best among older men, the hardest demographic for studios to reach. 
 
Sputtering in second place with about $15.2 million in ticket sales was “Scary Movie V” (Weinstein), according to Hollywood.com , which compiles box-office data. This parody movie was even cheaper — it cost about $20 million to make — but took in less than most analysts expected, especially considering the publicity generated by the stunt casting of Lindsay Lohan as herself. Perhaps this is the end of the road for the “Scary Movie” franchise. “The Croods,” “G.I. Joe: Retaliation” and “Evil Dead” rounded out the top five."

Curt is survived by his loving wife of 63 years, Sally Gettleman Fried, his five children: Melanie, Arthur, Robert, Judy, and Daniel, and their spouses: Barry, Caren, Nancy, Jon and DeLaune. His legacy includes 14 grandchildren and one great grandchild. Curt Fried escaped Nazi persecution in September, 1939 when, at the age of 14, he and his 15 year old brother Irwin, boarded a train in Vienna headed for Paris. They arrived the very day France declared war on Germany and were forced to re-route to Rotterdam. They eventually made their way to Newark, NJ where they found safety with relatives. Curt attended Weequahic High School and then entered the US Army and served as a radio specialist working on the Burma Road in India and China. After military service, Fried returned to the Bronx where he co-founded H&H Photographers, a photography studio that has proudly served the New York metropolitan area for over 65 years. Soon after his return to New York, Curt met Sally, and started their beautiful family, first in the Bronx and eventually in Ardsley, NY. The Fried's have lived in Ardsley for over 55 years and all five children graduated from Ardsley High School. All five attended America's finest universities and graduate schools. Melanie is a world renowned Speech Pathologist, Arthur a successful health care entrepreneur, Robert an Academy Award winning producer and media entrepreneur, Judy a respected Urologist, and Daniel a successful film producer who has now taken over the management of H & H Photographers. Curt Fried was beloved by all that knew him for his brilliant mathematical mind, his infectious sense of humor, his perseverance and his reliability. He loved his family. He loved his Jewishness. He loved tennis, golf and kibbitzing in the bagel room at the Polo Club in Boca. And he loved America for which he was unendingly grateful. From very challenging beginnings, Curt Fried built a legacy of caring, character and consistency that is being perpetuated by his five children, 14 grandchildren and one (so far) great-grandchild. He is already missed; his memory serves as our inspiration. The funeral will take place at Greenburgh Hebrew Center, 515 Broadway. Dobbs Ferry NY on Monday, April 15 at noon, with burial to follow at Sharon Gardens Cemetery in Valhalla."

His legacy includes 14 grandchildren and one great grandchild. Curt Fried escaped Nazi persecution in September, 1939 when, at the age of 14, he and his 15 year old brother Irwin, boarded a train in Vienna headed for Paris.

After military service, Fried returned to the Bronx where he co-founded H&H Photographers, a photography studio that has proudly served the New York metropolitan area for over 65 years. Soon after his return to New York, Curt met Sally, and started their beautiful family, first in the Bronx and eventually in Ardsley, NY. The Fried's have lived in Ardsley for over 55 years and all five children graduated from Ardsley High School. All five attended America's finest universities and graduate schools. Melanie is a world renowned Speech Pathologist, Arthur a successful health care entrepreneur, Robert an Academy Award winning producer and media entrepreneur, Judy a respected Urologist, and Daniel a successful film producer who has now taken over the management of H & H Photographers.

The news may offer consolation for the growing numbers of us who are entering age groups most at risk for cognitive decline. 
 
It was back in the 1990s that scientists at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., first discovered that exercise bulks up the brain. In groundbreaking experiments, they showed that mice given access to running wheels produced far more cells in an area of the brain controlling memory creation than animals that didn’t run. The exercised animals then performed better on memory tests than their sedentary labmates."

2013-04-17T00:00:00Z,"Looking at scenes of the Boston sidewalk a few hours after Monday’s bombing — torn clothing, bloodstains, shards of glass — I found my mind going back to a similar sidewalk in Tel Aviv in September 2003. A Hamas suicide bomber had blown himself up at a bus stop outside the Tsrifin army base, and by coincidence I was nearby and got there to witness the immediate aftermath. As I wrote then, parts of the bomber were still on the street, including his hairy leg. His shoe had been blown off, but his brown sock was still daintily on his foot. Israeli rescue workers calmly carried away the dead on stretchers, with an odd mix of horror and routine. But what I remember most was something the police spokesman said to me: “We will have this whole area cleaned up in two hours. By morning, the bus stop will be repaired. You will never know this happened.” 
 
We still do not know who set off the Boston Marathon bombs or why. But we do know now, after 9/11, after all the terrorism the world has seen in the last decade, what the right reaction is: wash the sidewalk, wipe away the blood, and let whoever did it know that while they have sickeningly maimed and killed some of our brothers and sisters, they have left no trace on our society or way of life. Terrorists are not strong enough to do that — only we can do that to ourselves — and we must never accommodate them."

The raids, the result of an investigation that began last year, reflected Syria’s growing allure to militant Islamist fighters who see Syria as a prime battleground. The foreign jihadist element in the insurgency has alarmed Western powers that want to see Mr. Assad step down but do not want him replaced by an Islamist militant government or stateless mayhem."
2013-04-17T00:00:00Z,"An obituary on April 9 about the former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher overstated what is known about one aspect of a 1986 bombing of Libya carried out by the United States with the Thatcher government’s support. Although initial news reports, in The Times and elsewhere, said Col. Muammar el-Qadaffi’s baby daughter was killed in that attack, her death was never confirmed, and reporting in recent years has shown that Qadaffi most likely lied about her death. Therefore it is probably not the case that the bombing “killed one of his children.”

There are restaurants solely devoted to the preparation of fish, rabbit and duck heads. In New York you may search long and hard without finding such a restaurant. Look carefully, though — not only in the warrens of a mall in Flushing, Queens, but also on Restaurant Row in Manhattan — and you may be surprised to see what’s looking back. Though the cooking process may render an entire head a nearly uniform brown, there’s no mistaking a rabbit’s incisors or a duck’s bill.

On Monday night, Google released extensive guidelines for software developers who want to build apps for Glass. With those guidelines, it is taking a page from Apple’s playbook, by being much more restrictive about the glasses than it has been with other products, particularly its Android operating system for phones, and controlling the type of apps that developers build."

2013-04-17T00:00:00Z,"“Deceptive Practice: The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay ” is a mouthful of a title, if not nearly as charmingly loquacious as those for some of Mr. Jay’s books, including “ Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women : Unique, Eccentric and Amazing Entertainers: Stone Eaters, Mind Readers, Poison Resisters, Daredevils, Singing Mice, etc., etc., etc., etc.” Those four punctuating “etc.’s” — what more could there be? — are an especially nice touch because they suggest that Mr. Jay has so much up his pushed-up sleeves that he couldn’t possibly squeeze everything into a single title. 
 
The promise of more is part of the showman’s pitch, of course, and Mr. Jay, born Richard Jay Potash in the late 1940s, is not only a magician, sleight-of-hand artist, archivist, historian, scholar, collector, raconteur, writer and lauded performer of stage and screen.

Nostalgia for old-fashioned Italian restaurants does not extend to the wine. The choices today are infinitely better than the fiasco, as the basket-clothed bottle is known. But Chianti is still the right idea, although it’s far from the only choice. Other sangiovese-based wines, like Rosso di Montalcino, would be great. As would vibrant Sicilian reds like nerello mascaleses from Mount Etna and Cerasuolos di Vittoria, or lively barberas, Valpolicellas, even lesser nebbiolos — you get the idea. And don’t rule out whites with good acidity, like Falanghina or Fiano di Avellino from Campania. Bubbles? How about Franciacorta brut, made using the Champagne method."

But now some economists are challenging the very foundations of that idea, raising questions about whether such a debt threshold even exists and setting off a fierce debate that flared up on Tuesday across the Internet about whether potentially flawed research is at least partly responsible for the slow growth that has bedeviled most advanced industrial countries since the recovery from the financial crisis began in 2009."

Since dying of a stroke last week at 87, Britain’s longest-serving prime minister in 150 years — and the only woman to hold the office — continued to stir intense passions. At issue were the elaborate ceremony and estimated $15 million cost of a funeral in whose planning she had a major voice, as well as the socially disruptive consequences of her no-turning-back battles in the 1980s to shake Britain from its long postwar slump."

According to the Kennedy Center press notes, the musical is the story of the ballerina Marie, on the cusp of womanhood, as she is “torn by her family’s poverty, her debt to the artist, and the lure of wealthy men.”"

Five years later, living in New York, Jim returns to Tulsa when he learns that Adrienne has been injured in an accident. In The New York Times Book Review, Gary Sernovitz writes , “Lytal asks the essential questions: how to be good; how to be an adult; how to live outside one’s head; how to love unselfishly; how to understand if this girl, this town — any of it, anything at all — are indispensable, and if they’re meaningful enough to turn into art.” In a recent e-mail interview, Mr. Lytal discussed the elements of autobiography in his book, what he’s learned from being a book critic and more.

Dr. Lynch, a professor of psychology, led the College earlier as its acting president, navigating fiscal and political crises with exemplary skill and dedication. During his presidency, student enrollment doubled and the criminal justice program moved into the top national ranks. His vision of a modern, state-of-the art campus was realized this past year, largely attributable to his efforts during three decades of leadership. We offer our deepest sympathies to his family. Benno Schmidt, Chairperson, CUNY Board of Trustees Matthew Goldstein, Chancellor"
2013-04-18T00:00:00Z,"LYNCH--Dr. Gerald W.,who served as President of John Jay College from 1976-2004 and was centrally responsible for saving the College from being shut down during the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, died April 17 following a long illness. He was 76 years old. At the time of his retirement in 2004, Dr. Lynch was the senior college president in the City University, and the only president serving at the time who had been at CUNY since the days of Open Admissions. Learning of Dr. Lynch's passing, his successor, Jeremy Travis, said: ""We mourn the loss of our friend, colleague and former President, Dr. Gerald W. Lynch. As John Jay's third president, he led the campaign to save the College during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. He then built John Jay into a vibrant educational institution with global reach. Tens of thousands of John Jay alumni, who every day make contributions to safety and justice around the world, stand in his debt. Today's students, faculty and staff enjoy a spectacular new campus that will serve as his lasting legacy. We are saddened by his passing and extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, who were members of the John Jay family. They should know that his vision continues to guide us every day."" Dr. Lynch joined the John Jay community in 1967 as Director of Student Activities and Assistant Professor of Psychology. He was named Dean of Students in 1968 and served in that role through 1971, when he was appointed Vice President of the College and Acting Dean of Faculty. He became acting president of John Jay in 1975 following the resignation of Dr. Donald H. Riddle, and shortly thereafter was confronted with an attempt by the City University Board of Trustees to close the College. Dr. Lynch rallied internal and external support on a broad scale that ultimately convinced University officials to back down from the threatened closure, and with the shutdown averted, Dr. Lynch was formally named as John Jay's third President. He was sworn in on March 24, 1977, in a festive ceremony that also marked the College's 13th anniversary. Despite the downsizing of the College's academic offerings as part of the price of saving the institution, Dr. Lynch took enormous pride in his steadfast refusal to fire or retrench any full-time employee for budgetary reasons. His tenure as President would be marked by a steady increase in the size of the student body, the faculty and the campus itself, including the initial stages of the expansion that culminated in 2011 in the opening of the 14-story, block-long new facility on 11th Avenue and 59th Street. Under Dr. Lynch's leadership, the first University Distinguished Professors were added to the John Jay faculty; graduate-level offerings were expanded, and Ph.D. programs in Criminal Justice and Forensic Psychology were created at the CUNY Graduate Center. He established John Jay's reputation on an international scale with the creation of the Bramshill Scholar exchange program with the British national police college, the McCabe Fellows program in conjunction with An Garda Siochana, the national police service in his beloved Ireland, and the biennial international conference on crime, justice and public order, among other initiatives. He helped shape a broad conception of the College's mission of educating for justice, and in so doing left a legacy that continues to define John Jay. As one leading faculty member described Dr. Lynch, He is really a liberal arts president in a criminal justice setting. As President, Dr. Lynch continued the commitment to public service and difficult causes that dated to the time in graduate school when he traveled to Selma, Ala., to march with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other prominent civil rights leaders. In the late 1970's he took up the cause of oppressed Soviet Jews with the same vigor and passion, traveling to the Soviet Union to meet with dissidents and bear witness to their plight. He served as Chair of the New York City Police Foundation; Chair of the New York Fire Safety Foundation; Vice Chair of the United States Marshals Foundation; Chair of the Catholic Interracial Council, and Chair of the WNET/Channel 13 Board of Advisors. In city and state government service, he chaired a New York State Casino Gambling Study Panel; chaired search committees for New York City police and fire commissioners under Mayor David Dinkins; served on the Board of Directors of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, and was a member of the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland, which played a key role in bringing an end to the sectarian strife there. At his retirement in 2004, Dr. Lynch was praised by City University Chancellor Matthew Goldstein, who said in a statement: From the pioneering work in establishing support for the College during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's to his success in bringing about consistently higher academic program rankings, President Lynch has provided invaluable service to the people of our city and our state. Dr. Lynch, who earned his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from New York University, is survived by his wife of 42 years, Gay Sherry Lynch; a son, Timothy, who is an assistant district attorney with the Bronx District Attorney's Office; a daughter, Elizabeth Lynch, Director of the Center for Microfinance Leadership at Women's World Banking; a son-in-law, Bryon Korutz, and a granddaughter, Alice Georgina Lynch Korutz. A scholarship has been created in honor and memory of Dr. Lynch. Contributions may be made to the Dr. Gerald W.

2013-04-19T00:00:00Z,"The hit Broadway musical “Mamma Mia!” will transfer from the Winter Garden Theater to the Broadhurst Theater six blocks south this year so the Shubert Organization — which owns both theaters — can clear the way for the possible opening of a new musical, “Rocky,” at the Winter Garden next season. “Rocky,” which had its world premiere in Hamburg in November, has not been announced for Broadway, but two theater executives familiar with the “Rocky” plans said Thursday that the current plan is to open it at the Winter Garden by next spring, though nothing is set. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the “Rocky” plans are confidential. As for “Mamma Mia!,” its lead producer and creator, Judy Craymer, announced her show’s move on Thursday, and predicted that it would secure the future for “Mamma Mia!” on Broadway “for many years to come.” The reason: “Mamma Mia!” will save as much as $100,000 a week in running costs at the 1,160-seat Broadhurst, because the 1,530-seat Winter Garden comes with higher costs, including rent, that are tied to its size. A spokesman for “Mamma Mia!” declined to provide the show’s weekly running costs; theater veterans believe the amount is between $600,000 and $700,000. After 12 years of performances the show’s ticket sales are usually in the mid-to-high six figures; last week it grossed $750,520."

2013-04-19T00:00:00Z,"LYNCH--Dr. Gerald W.,who served as President of John Jay College from 1976-2004 and was centrally responsible for saving the College from being shut down during the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, died April 17 following a long illness. He was 76 years old. At the time of his retirement in 2004, Dr. Lynch was the senior college president in the City University, and the only president serving at the time who had been at CUNY since the days of Open Admissions. Learning of Dr. Lynch's passing, his successor, Jeremy Travis, said: ""We mourn the loss of our friend, colleague and former President, Dr. Gerald W. Lynch. As John Jay's third president, he led the campaign to save the College during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. He then built John Jay into a vibrant educational institution with global reach. Tens of thousands of John Jay alumni, who every day make contributions to safety and justice around the world, stand in his debt. Today's students, faculty and staff enjoy a spectacular new campus that will serve as his lasting legacy. We are saddened by his passing and extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, who were members of the John Jay family. They should know that his vision continues to guide us every day."" Dr. Lynch joined the John Jay community in 1967 as Director of Student Activities and Assistant Professor of Psychology. He was named Dean of Students in 1968 and served in that role through 1971, when he was appointed Vice President of the College and Acting Dean of Faculty. He became acting president of John Jay in 1975 following the resignation of Dr. Donald H. Riddle, and shortly thereafter was confronted with an attempt by the City University Board of Trustees to close the College. Dr. Lynch rallied internal and external support on a broad scale that ultimately convinced University officials to back down from the threatened closure, and with the shutdown averted, Dr. Lynch was formally named as John Jay's third President. He was sworn in on March 24, 1977, in a festive ceremony that also marked the College's 13th anniversary. Despite the downsizing of the College's academic offerings as part of the price of saving the institution, Dr. Lynch took enormous pride in his steadfast refusal to fire or retrench any full-time employee for budgetary reasons. His tenure as President would be marked by a steady increase in the size of the student body, the faculty and the campus itself, including the initial stages of the expansion that culminated in 2011 in the opening of the 14-story, block-long new facility on 11th Avenue and 59th Street. Under Dr. Lynch's leadership, the first University Distinguished Professors were added to the John Jay faculty; graduate-level offerings were expanded, and Ph.D. programs in Criminal Justice and Forensic Psychology were created at the CUNY Graduate Center. He established John Jay's reputation on an international scale with the creation of the Bramshill Scholar exchange program with the British national police college, the McCabe Fellows program in conjunction with An Garda Siochana, the national police service in his beloved Ireland, and the biennial international conference on crime, justice and public order, among other initiatives. He helped shape a broad conception of the College's mission of educating for justice, and in so doing left a legacy that continues to define John Jay. As one leading faculty member described Dr. Lynch, He is really a liberal arts president in a criminal justice setting. As President, Dr. Lynch continued the commitment to public service and difficult causes that dated to the time in graduate school when he traveled to Selma, Ala., to march with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other prominent civil rights leaders. In the late 1970's he took up the cause of oppressed Soviet Jews with the same vigor and passion, traveling to the Soviet Union to meet with dissidents and bear witness to their plight. He served as Chair of the New York City Police Foundation; Chair of the New York Fire Safety Foundation; Vice Chair of the United States Marshals Foundation; Chair of the Catholic Interracial Council, and Chair of the WNET/Channel 13 Board of Advisors. In city and state government service, he chaired a New York State Casino Gambling Study Panel; chaired search committees for New York City police and fire commissioners under Mayor David Dinkins; served on the Board of Directors of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, and was a member of the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland, which played a key role in bringing an end to the sectarian strife there. At his retirement in 2004, Dr. Lynch was praised by City University Chancellor Matthew Goldstein, who said in a statement: From the pioneering work in establishing support for the College during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's to his success in bringing about consistently higher academic program rankings, President Lynch has provided invaluable service to the people of our city and our state. Dr. Lynch, who earned his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from New York University, is survived by his wife of 42 years, Gay Sherry Lynch; a son, Timothy, who is an assistant district attorney with the Bronx District Attorney's Office; a daughter, Elizabeth Lynch, Director of the Center for Microfinance Leadership at Women's World Banking; a son-in-law, Bryon Korutz, and a granddaughter, Alice Georgina Lynch Korutz. A scholarship has been created in honor and memory of Dr. Lynch. Contributions may be made to the Dr. Gerald W. Lynch Scholarship Fund, which provides financial support to exemplary masters and doctoral students who have a demonstrated interest in the areas of human dignity, human rights and the police. Checks may be mailed to John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Dr. Gerald W. Lynch Scholarship Fund, 524, West 59th Street, NYC, NY 10019."

2013-04-19T00:00:00Z,"PHILLIPS--Gifford. After a long and delightful life, we say goodbye to Gifford Phillips, who died April 17, in Palm Desert California, where he was wintering with his wife of 60 years, Joann Phillips. Gifford was an active force for good and equality. Gifford was born June 30 1918 in Chevy Chase, Maryland, the son of James Laughlin Phillips and Alice Conyngham Gifford. His father died suddenly from influenza just four months after his only child's birth. Alice Phillips subsequently remarried to Charles Alfred Johnson. Gifford was raised with his younger brother, Charles Johnson, in Charlford Castle, a residence south of Denver. Phillips attended Stanford University but transferred to Yale University, from which he graduated in 1942. Pursuing a life long activism, Gifford founded Frontier magazine, a liberal West Coast political monthly, with editor Phil Kerby in 1949 after moving to Los Angeles. In 1954, Frontier published its blacklist expose, ""The Hollywood Story"" by Elizabeth Poe Kerby. The expose's appearance signaled the passing of the ""red scare"" era. Phillips published the magazine until 1966 when it was folded into The Nation magazine. Phillips served as Associate Publisher of that magazine from 1966 to 1970. He married Joann Kocher in 1953 after they met at a Democratic Party function. His deep involvement in California politics had started with being Treasurer for Helen Gahagan Douglas' congressional campaign against Richard Nixon in 1948. Phillips would serve as a delegate from California to Democratic National Conventions in 1952, 1956, 1960, and 1964. He was an early supporter of Eugene McCarthy in 1968, co-chairing McCarthy's California campaign with future governor Jerry Brown. Phillips was an ardent supporter of George McGovern's presidential campaign, which eventually earned him a place on President Richard Nixon's 1972 'enemies list', much to Gifford's delight. From the 1950s, he was a partner in Pardee Phillips, a real estate corporation that built houses and shopping malls in Southern California and Nevada. However, art and politics were to always remain at the forefront of his interests. Gifford and Joann became great friends and supporters of southern California artists including Richard Diebenkorn, Emerson Woelffer, Lee Mullican and Claire Falkenstien. As one of Diebenkorn's earliest patrons, Gifford introduced Diebenkorn's figurative paintings to his uncle, Duncan Phillips, head of the Phillips Collection in Washington DC. Gifford also commended his uncle to the work of Mark Rothko leading to the acquisitions that form the celebrated Rothko Room at the museum. Phillips was founding chairman of the Contemporary Art Council at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in 1961. He joined the Board of Trustees of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1966 where he served for four decades including eight years as Chair of the Painting and Sculpture Committee. Gifford served on the Phillips Collection Board for over 30 years. Gifford was a member of the Board of Governors of the Yale University Art Museum from 1985 to 1999. He was also a member of the Mark Rothko foundation when that group resolved the complicated and protracted legal battle over that artist's estate. He was a Trustee and President of the Pasadena Art Museum from 1970 to 1974, a period during which that institution would become the Norton Simon museum and serve as the setting for a landmark case on the rights of museum donors. In 1987, Joann and Gifford moved permanently to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where as summer residents they had been involved in local arts efforts since 1968. He chaired the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival for several years. He and Joann with wise counsel from Ohkay Owingeh elder and scholar, Alfonso Ortiz, and writer and scholar, Edward T. Hall founded the Chamiza Foundation in 1989 to support and stimulate Pueblo culture. Recognized by a resolution in the New Mexico House of Representatives for its work in 2009, the foundation is nationally renowned for its innovative grant support guided by a board with a majority of Pueblo members. In this and so many other efforts, Gifford touched many people, leaving us all much happier for having known him. Besides his wife, Phillips is survived by his son, James, of La Quinta, California, daughters, Alice Swistel of New York City, and Marjorie Elliott of Princeton, New Jersey, and eight grandchildren, Claire Elliott, Rosalind Elliott, Gifford Elliott, Sophia Phillips, Jackson Phillips, Lily Swistel, Nina Swistel, and Zazu Swistel."

The lines, which in the original are spoken in passing and have no bearing on the play’s plot, were deleted before the play opened at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater on Wednesday evening. It had been in previews since March 21."

He told them – as he has everyone from the Rolling Stones to Jeff Buckley – that they had to be sure they were doing it for the music, not the money.
 
“He makes you work a lot,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “He’s tough about that. He always told us if you give to music, music will give back to you. But you have to put a lot of work into that.”"

2013-04-20T00:00:00Z,"A bit more turmoil has come to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco . Earlier this week a former curator sued the institution saying she was wrongfully fired because she was a union supporter and whistleblower.
 
In the suit, Lynn Orr, who spent 29 years working at the institution’s de Young and Legion of Honor museums, says she was told she was being fired for performance-related reasons despite having had sterling evaluations. She charges her dismissal is related to her appearance at a union protest and to objections she raised about the changing of an appraisal that she “believed fraudulent and unlawful.”"

Mr. Frammartino’s feature-length “Quattro Volte” was a critics’ favorite in 2011 — my colleague A.O. Scott called it “idiosyncratic and amazing” — and the 25-minute “ Alberi ” (it means trees in Italian) bears a strong family resemblance to the earlier film. It is free of dialogue but full of sound, and the VW Dome at PS1 wraps the viewer in wind, footsteps, rustling leaves and the indistinct hum of distant human chatter. It takes place in and around a village perched in the hills of southern Italy, and it gives equal, if not preferential, billing to its nonhuman characters: trees, streams, ancient stone buildings."

When the most challenging emergency calls come in, she responds: to a worker on scaffolding who has had a heart attack; to a person pinned under a subway train; to a building or floor collapse. Recently, she was called uptown to help with the rescue of a man trapped in the muck of the Second Avenue subway project, 75 feet underground."

2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"An article on April 7 about the conductor John Eliot Gardner misstated the reason Mr. Gardiner released 27 CDs to record the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000.

The article also described incorrectly Weiner’s reaction to a debate in the House of Representatives in July 2010 on the 9/11 health and compensation act. Weiner went berserk because he believed that Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, was trying to scuttle that day’s vote, not because King was trying to scuttle the act. King supported the act, which later passed."

On Saturday, a forum of five Democratic mayoral candidates on the topic of public housing turned into a startling show of hostility toward the woman regarded as the front-runner in the New York race, Christine C. Quinn. The audience at the forum — sponsored by Teamsters Local 237 and the nonprofit Community Service Society — seemed to regard Ms. Quinn, the City Council speaker, as a doppelgänger of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and directed its anger about his housing and policing policies toward her."
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"An article last Sunday about the migration of American Indians to urban areas over the past several decades quoted incorrectly from comments by Bill Ziegler, the president and chief executive of the Little Earth of United Tribes housing complex, in describing efforts to halt the cycle of poverty.

2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"An obituary on April 7 about Edith Schaeffer, the author of books that helped define conservative Christian family values for a worldwide evangelical audience, misstated the date and place of her death. She died on Saturday, March 30, at her home in Gryon, Switzerland — not on Sunday, April 1, in Huemoz, Switzerland."
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"Barclays Center has a somewhat forbidding atmosphere for visiting teams. The music pumped through the arena’s loudspeakers, hand-selected by the mix-tape artist J. Period, has an aggressive attitude. The black-clad Brooklynettes dance team has a decidedly adult attitude. And the Nets, in black home uniforms that are in stark contrast with typical N.B.A. fashion, certainly look tough, even if their game is based on offensive execution more than any sort of intimidation.
 
For the Nets’ first-round playoff series against the Chicago Bulls, the arena will grow even darker, with the team distributing black T-shirts to fans in hopes of creating a “blackout” in the crowd."
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"During the weekly exchange of peace handshakes several months ago at the small church around the corner from where I live in Chicago, a fellow congregant met my extended hand with a firm grip and said, “I heard that you lost your job — you must be scared.” Then she followed up with a “Peace be with you” and moved on to another parishioner.
 
It was true. When the large bank I had worked for underwent “restructuring” a few months before, I quickly became one of nearly 12 million unemployed people in the United States. That’s about the same number of people who watched the zombie drama “The Walking Dead” this season, and more than the entire population of Ohio."
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"DURING its heyday, Titusville, Fla., enjoyed the distinction of being the capital of Florida’s Space Coast. For decades, technicians, engineers and scientists helped send astronauts into space from the Kennedy Space Center. On July 16, 1969, Apollo 11 lifted off from there, carrying the men who would become the first to walk on the moon. 
 
But after the Space Shuttle program ended in 2011, and 8,000 people lost their jobs, this boomtown born of the space race started to lose its footing. NASA says it still has “a robust program of exploration, technology development and scientific research that will last for years to come,” but the shuttle program was crucial to Titusville’s and Brevard County’s economy. Now private employers are creating jobs to help make up for the loss. The shuttle Atlantis, meanwhile, which once charged into outer space, is in permanent retirement at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Center."
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"An Upper East Side town house that in 1981 received the dreaded thumbs-down designation of being “a no-style structure” from the Landmarks Preservation Commission because of an unloved mid-20th-century revamping, sold for $27 million after undergoing a 21st-century rejuvenation, in the most expensive sale of the week, according to city records.
 
The five-story town house at 12 East 76th Street, built in 1882, attracted such intense interest from buyers seeking a state-of-the-art residence with a classical exterior — in the course of a gut renovation that began in 2008, red brick was replaced with Italian limestone — that it was never formally listed on the market. It traded after just three viewings, in a whisper sale."
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"Fred R. Conrad used a long exposure and a hand-held flash to photograph the Survivor Tree at the 9/11 Memorial. “I must have looked like a madman running around the tree firing my strobe into its branches,” he said. “Such is spring in New York.”"
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"East of West Egg Even F. Scott Fitzgerald could not have imagined the extravagance of Tiffany & Company’s Blue Book Ball Thursday night to introduce its collection of jewelry inspired by the jazz age and the new movie version of “The Great Gatsby.” Tiffany built a blue box over the skating rink at Rockefeller Center, with suspended aerialists and the Rockettes. The buffets were almost unimaginable. And, a rarity at New York high-profile events, most of the women wore their own dresses and jewels. Many guests were Asian, some in native dress. Tiffany’s focus on the era coincides with a forceful trend in men’s wear, a 21st-century take on the Gatsby style, bottom row, seen on men passing the store’s facade, marked with “fountains” of tape. On April 17, the store held a reception, bottom left and right, for the new designs, and young people dressed in the spirit. Not to be missed are the windows, each one a glittering gem, by Christopher Young."

2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,A report last Sunday about the marriage of Jessica Leight and Amir Satvat referred incorrectly to the groom’s work at the EMC Corporation. He helps the company invest in data storage companies; he does not sell data storage.
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"“THE TUDORS,” with its ruffs and tufted silks; “The Borgias,” all gilt and jeweled vestments; and, of course, “Game of Thrones,” with its boiled-wool cloaks and armored corsets, have inspired a flurry of fashion stories and runway interpretations. “Da Vinci’s Demons” is but the latest costume extravaganza poised to charm the fashion set.
 
The series, which bowed with a flourish on the Starz network on April 12, offers a tapestry of faux Renaissance costumes so rich yet approachable that you might suppose the producers had an eye to future merchandising deals. That thought occurred to Annie Symons, the creator of the lavish gowns, doublets and a beat-up leather jacket — a kind of Renaissance biker coat worn by the swashbuckling Da Vinci. “A line based on the show: that’s something I would be really interested in pursuing,” she said."
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"When Rockefeller Center opened in 1939 after a decade of construction, it was not received with the glory we shower on it now. Newspapers were filled with letters calling it one of the ugliest complexes in the city. The building of what today is considered one of the crown jewels of the Manhattan skyline is a saga of big money, intriguing power brokers and one of the most glamorous periods in the city’s history. 
 
The story is told artfully and addictively in Daniel Okrent’s “Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center,” a Pulitzer Prize finalist for history in 2004. Join us for an online discussion with Mr. Okrent and the novelist and culture critic Kurt Andersen, author of the best-selling novel “Heyday” and most recently “True Believers.”"

2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"Mercedes-Benz is going smaller and sportier with its Concept GLA, a compact crossover aimed at younger buyers. The GLA, to be unveiled at the Shanghai Motor Show this weekend, has a long, muscular nose, large wheels and squat haunches. The mechanical bits include a turbocharged 2-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine, making 208 horsepower, a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and 4Matic all-wheel drive.
 
A production version may be available in the United States in late 2014, though it is likely to lack some of the baubles of the show car, like the kitschy frameless doors reminiscent of an old Subaru. But one can hope that the high-definition cameras mounted to the roof rails – which could be removed and attached to a ski helmet or dog collar — and laser-beam lights that double as movie projectors will make the cut."

Designed by Andy Spade, the fashion-world veteran who helped start Kate Spade (his wife’s namesake line) before opening the New York storefront and branding agency Partners & Spade, the colorful collection of men’s and women’s crisp pajama separates and jaunty underwear is meant to encourage luxuriating in the kinds of things that comfortable nightclothes inspire one to do. “Essentially, we’re designing an everyday uniform for reading, writing, painting, pondering and playing — whether you’re in the bedroom or not,” Spade says. With practical and stylish boxers features like a coin pocket for the men and Liberty of London fabric for the women, you may soon find yourself answering the door in your underwear.

I was in self-imposed exile at the time, studying journalism at the University of Hong Kong, and I would answer that the country’s military leaders were immoral, Buddhists in name only. I would also point out that Myanmar’s pre-colonial monarchical rulers — they, too, nominally Buddhist — also had committed great crimes. In other words, nothing was wrong with the religion itself; the problem was with the politicians who were flouting it."
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"Amaryllis Knight, a globe-trotting, British-born designer, has left her aesthetic fingerprints all over her adopted home of Los Angeles: in the homes, gardens and offices of private design clients; in her own house ; and soon, in the smartly appointed restaurant that chef Josef Centeno is opening this summer (Orsa & Winston). Now, with the opening of Altai — the retail store (which opens April 18) and online platform for her consultancy and furniture studio — Knight’s eclectic vision is, at last, shoppable. “It’s a lot more than a store,” she says. “It’s a way to further explore my work and interests while contributing to a conversation in Los Angeles about varied worlds of design and how they intersect.” Situated on a stretch of 3rd Street that’s a retail desert — but a quick skip to LACMA and Regen Projects — the light-drenched, vaulted-ceilinged space sells everything from $14 Santa Maria Novella lozenges to a $600,000 1948 Vincent 1000cc Rapide Series B motorcycle with a legendary racing pedigree. (“It’s a wild machine,” Knight says.)
 
Equally thrilling is Altai’s selection of men’s fashion, which includes exclusives from Raf Simons and Christophe Lemaire and lesser-known standouts like the Belgian designer Tim Coppens and the British label Casely-Hayford. Knight’s own furniture pieces — which share a fabrication facility in back with The Falcon Ten (a collection by her fiancé, Ian Barry) — sit alongside Issey Miyake’s lamps for Artemide and blown-glass objets d’art by Andi Kovel and Justin Parker. The in-house design consultancy has extended its services to include personal styling for men and women, run by the fashion director Teena Sahebi. There’s a blog, too, edited by the curator Corinna Peipon, to reflect Knight’s taste in travel, art and food. It all feels new and special, which is a feat in today’s hyper-linked retail scene. “It’s reductive, and yet warm and comfortable,” says Knight of the Altai aesthetic. “I strive to design environments that encourage presence — in one’s self, in one’s life, in a place, in a moment.”"

Flash-forward nine years, as London is swept by a wave of murders and Susan (Anna Maxwell Martin), now a homemaker and mother of two, thinks she has detected a pattern. After wangling an entry into Scotland Yard, she persuades detectives to scour a rubbish site for a victim she believes has gone undetected. 
 
But when the police don’t find a corpse and dismiss her theory as poppycock, she turns for assistance to her former colleagues — Millie (Rachael Stirling), conversant in 14 languages and good with maps; Lucy (Sophie Rundle), with her photographic memory; and Jean (Julie Graham), their onetime supervisor — who have returned to civilian life and kept their intelligence work secret from even those closest to them."

There are paths for foodies, art lovers and history buffs. And in one pocket of rural Scotland, there are paths for stargazers.
 
As of 2009, the Galloway Forest Park, in the rural Dumfries and Galloway region, is home to Europe’s first International Dark Sky Park, a designation bestowed by the Tucson-based International Dark-Sky Association as determined by the relative lack of light pollution. On clear nights, stargazers gather in clearings at trailheads near the park’s visitor centers. But some of the best viewing, like the best hiking, lies in the remote highlands area accessed by the Queens Way road, where hikers can wander over spongy meadows or along the edge of Clatteringshaws Loch under a canopy of stars."

Yet whatever the Jura lack in awesome, icy grandeur is offset by a quiet splendor offered to anyone willing to take a stroll among them: Not a hike, though you can do that in the Jura, too, but a sweatless, pokey amble on a well-marked route. One warm day a few years ago my wife, Heidi, and I took our young daughter on a seven-mile walk from Avenches to Murten, two villages near the Jura foothills. The terrain suited us well. The farmers’ path was stroller-friendly, and we wandered along great patches of flowering rapeseed, through murky forests and next to an 11th-century chapel built from stones the Romans had cut. Here on the border dividing three Swiss cantons the languages mix like kirsch in a fondue: a rue melts into a strasse that ends at a table with brats and bières."

In 2004, after touring with another production from Ms. Rice’s company, Kneehigh Theater, Mr. Sturrock returned to the troupe’s home base, Cornwall, England, just in time to join in the city’s May Day festivities welcoming the advent of summer. The party ended in tragedy for Mr. Sturrock, when he fell off a wall and broke his neck. “Mayday Mayday,” written and performed by Mr. Sturrock and directed by his wife, Katy Carmichael, is a solo show in which he recounts the story of the accident — which initially left him paralyzed — and his long journey back to well-being, and back to the spotlight.

While displaying his signature wit and the historical derring-do of his middle period (including his definitive, two-part “Three Musketeers” adaptation ), “Robin and Marian” is Mr. Lester in a minor key, a tempered swashbuckler drawing pathos and poignancy from its portraits of heroes in decline.
 
An aging Robin Hood (Sean Connery) has spent almost two decades fighting for a plundering Richard the Lionheart (Richard Harris) in pointless Crusades. Now he returns to Sherwood Forest to face the Sheriff of Nottingham (Robert Shaw) over the objections of Marian (a luminous Audrey Hepburn), who has become an abbess. She is tired of the brawling vanity of these longtime combatants and takes action in a twist as surprising as it is heartbreaking. “Robin and Marian,” in today’s era of muscle-bound screen spectaculars and video-game blood baths, challenges illusory notions of heroism itself.

The quintessential Tuscan landscape is etched in the minds of many thanks to decades’ worth of idyllic images cast on the silver screen. But there’s no substitute for lacing up your walking shoes and experiencing the scenery firsthand. A favorite route that takes less than two hours links the medieval hilltop towns of Radda in Chianti and Castello di Volpaia in central Tuscany. Starting in Radda, head west down the town’s main street, with its stone walls and valley views, and bear right onto the narrow road immediately after the sign for Castellina. Olive groves and vineyards line this leafy lane, from which a backward glance will reveal a glimpse of ocher-hued Radda. Turn off at the sign for Sassaiola, and follow the path alongside the woods to emerge on the main road toward Castello di Volpaia."

In fact, for the joyous hordes of young people who stroll its length while flirting, singing, smoking and occasionally stopping into a bar for a drink or a snack, it is just another Saturday night. Cava Baja is ground zero for that most Spanish of rituals, the tapeo. 
 
The reason tapas restaurants outside Spain never have the right vibe is that they mistake a means for an end. A proper tapeo, in which you stand at one bar with your friends, order a drink and a snack to share, then move on to the next, repeating as long as your wallet and equilibrium hold out, is more about socializing than small plates. Cava Baja, which has dozens of tapas bars along its two-block length, compresses the process."
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"They nicknamed it the “wobbly bridge” when it opened, in 2000, because an engineering miscalculation caused it to sway so badly that people who tried to walk across it grew dizzy and even fell down. But after it was modified and opened again two years later, the Millennium Bridge, a pedestrian-only suspension bridge across the Thames, connecting Bankside on the south side to the City of London financial district on the north, became one of the great walking experiences in a city that might have been invented for strolling. 
 
At 1,006 feet long, the bridge takes just five minutes to cross, and can be a destination in itself. At one end is St. Paul’s Cathedral, and that is where I like to start; you climb up to the top, and get someone to whisper at you from across the Whispering Gallery, and then climb down again. Then you walk straight down to the Thames and the bridge, slender and elegant in gleaming steel."
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"Most writers come to loathe their most popular piece of writing, but in 2008, when BBC Four asked John le Carré to name his best books, the first title out of his mouth was “The Spy Who Came In From the Cold” (1963). This was wisdom on his part. The novel remains the crucial introduction to le Carré’s cool moral universe — his bald, adjective-free prose style, his penetrating insight into human character, his ethical inquisitiveness and, perhaps best of all, his ability to tell a story in such a way that you’re forever just one step behind a tripping kind of jazz beat. It set the tone for the procession of antiheroes in his books. “What do you think spies are: priests, saints and martyrs?” his hero, the West Berlin intelligence station chief Alec Leamas, asks. “They’re a squalid procession of vain fools, traitors too, yes; pansies, sadists and drunkards, people who play cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten lives.”

Evidence of this is visible during a two-and-a-half-hour walk along the Halic, or Golden Horn, which separates the Old City from the more contemporary Beyoglu. At the Fener (“lighthouse”) bus stop, cross Abdulezelpasa Caddesi — the main shore road — and walk past the trinket shops to the walled compound that includes the Church of St. George, seat of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Inside, you’ll find the ivory-inlaid throne of the patriarch, Bartholomew, and a wall of gilded icons. Farther up the main avenue is the golden-domed Church of St. Stephen of the Bulgars, constructed of iron panels that were cast in Vienna, barged down the Danube and pieced together here in the late 1800s.
 
Continue along Murselpasa Caddesi for a meatball break at Kofteci Arnavut (look for a Mavi Kose sign), then duck into the Jewish neighborhood of Balat (above) to reach the intersection with Leblebiciler Sokak (the Sellers of Roasted Chickpeas Street). Straight ahead is the Yanbol Synagogue, named for a town in Bulgaria. Continuing deeper into Balat takes you to the Ahrida Synagogue, with its restored wooden interior dome."

2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"SIEGEL--Samuel R. July 31, 1909 - April 21, 2012 Dr. Siegel had a lifelong commitment to civil rights and social justice. He cared deeply about people both those close to him as well as the disenfranchised, and he made every effort to create a more humane world. Dr. Siegel graduated from the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine in 1933, and started his practice in dentistry moving into the field of orthodontics. He pioneered the practice of early childhood intervention, and published two papers in the New York State Dental Journal in 1956 and '59 on his approach. In World War II, Dr. Siegel served as a Captain with the 58th Air Service Group, 5th Air Force from 1943 -l946 with combat service in the Asiatic Pacific Campaign in New Guinea and the Philippines. He was a cofounder of the local branch of The Medical Committee for Human Rights, and went south during the Civil Rights struggle in the 1960s. He and his son, Larry, a Freedom Rider who predeceased him, worked at the same time in the south although in different states: Larry worked on voter registration and Dr Siegel tended to the injured. Upon retiring from private practice in 1968, Dr. Siegel worked for the next 18 years as an Assistant Clinical Professor in the Pediatric Dentistry Department at New York University School of Dentistry teaching graduate students in the preventive aspects of early treatment in developing malocclusions. In 1975, Dr. Siegel was invited to Cuba to lecture on early childhood intervention and to visit the Havana School of Stomatology, dental clinics, and training schools throughout the country. His article on his visit was published in Dental Survey: The Journal of Dental Practice in 1975. In 1982 when he was 72, Dr. Siegel was arrested for his act of civil disobedience, joining an antinuclear demonstration in front of the United States Mission to the U.N. He is quoted in the Times of June 15th as saying: ""This is my first time for me but I feel that I have to do this for my grandchildren."" He treated thousands of patients before his retirement, and arranged a sliding scale of payment or no payment for those with hardships. Dr. Siegel was also an orthodontic consultant to several unions including Local 1199. Throughout his life, Dr. Siegel was a devotee of physical exercise and athletics. He tried out for professional baseball as a very young man, played a fierce game of tennis, liked golf, and bicycled all over New York City until well into his 80s. Four years ago he moved with his wife, Beatrice who also predeceased him, from New York to Maryland to be near his stepdaughter and son-in-law. He never missed his twice -weekly poker games. He is survived by his stepdaughter, Andra; his son-in-law, Jon; his son, Michael; his granddaughter, Julia and her husband Christophe; his granddaughter, Sumi and her husband Max, and his great-granddaughters, Willa and Zoey."

2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"PHILLIPS--Gifford. The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art is saddened to learn of the passing of our distinguished member Gifford Phillips. A member since 1961, he was a true advocate of the role of modern art in transcending national barriers. Among his many key associations with the Council and The Museum of Modern Art was his chairmanship of the Council's Program Committee, which he led with great intelligence and energy. He and his wife Joann travelled widely with the International Council, making friends throughout the world. Our most sincere condolences are expressed to Gifford's wife Joann Phillips; his children James, Alice Swistel, and Marjorie Elliott; and eight grandchildren.

Cullman, Beatrix Medinger, Vice Chairs William L. Bernhard, Secretary The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art"
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"PHILLIPS--Gifford. After a long and delightful life, we say goodbye to Gifford Phillips, who died April 17, in Palm Desert California, where he was wintering with his wife of 60 years, Joann Phillips. Gifford was an active force for good and equality. Gifford was born June 30 1918 in Chevy Chase, Maryland, the son of James Laughlin Phillips and Alice Conyngham Gifford. His father died suddenly from influenza just four months after his only child's birth. Alice Phillips subsequently remarried to Charles Alfred Johnson. Gifford was raised with his younger brother, Charles Johnson, in Charlford Castle, a residence south of Denver. Phillips attended Stanford University but transferred to Yale University, from which he graduated in 1942. Pursuing a life long activism, Gifford founded Frontier magazine, a liberal West Coast political monthly, with editor Phil Kerby in 1949 after moving to Los Angeles. In 1954, Frontier published its blacklist expose, ""The Hollywood Story"" by Elizabeth Poe Kerby. The expose's appearance signaled the passing of the ""red scare"" era. Phillips published the magazine until 1966 when it was folded into The Nation magazine. Phillips served as Associate Publisher of that magazine from 1966 to 1970. He married Joann Kocher in 1953 after they met at a Democratic Party function. His deep involvement in California politics had started with being Treasurer for Helen Gahagan Douglas' congressional campaign against Richard Nixon in 1948. Phillips would serve as a delegate from California to Democratic National Conventions in 1952, 1956, 1960, and 1964. He was an early supporter of Eugene McCarthy in 1968, co-chairing McCarthy's California campaign with future governor Jerry Brown. Phillips was an ardent supporter of George McGovern's presidential campaign, which eventually earned him a place on President Richard Nixon's 1972 'enemies list', much to Gifford's delight. From the 1950s, he was a partner in Pardee Phillips, a real estate corporation that built houses and shopping malls in Southern California and Nevada. However, art and politics were to always remain at the forefront of his interests. Gifford and Joann became great friends and supporters of southern California artists including Richard Diebenkorn, Emerson Woelffer, Lee Mullican and Claire Falkenstien. As one of Diebenkorn's earliest patrons, Gifford introduced Diebenkorn's figurative paintings to his uncle, Duncan Phillips, head of the Phillips Collection in Washington DC. Gifford also commended his uncle to the work of Mark Rothko leading to the acquisitions that form the celebrated Rothko Room at the museum. Phillips was founding chairman of the Contemporary Art Council at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in 1961. He joined the Board of Trustees of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1966 where he served for four decades including eight years as Chair of the Painting and Sculpture Committee. Gifford served on the Phillips Collection Board for over 30 years. Gifford was a member of the Board of Governors of the Yale University Art Museum from 1985 to 1999. He was also a member of the Mark Rothko foundation when that group resolved the complicated and protracted legal battle over that artist's estate. He was a Trustee and President of the Pasadena Art Museum from 1970 to 1974, a period during which that institution would become the Norton Simon museum and serve as the setting for a landmark case on the rights of museum donors. In 1987, Joann and Gifford moved permanently to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where as summer residents they had been involved in local arts efforts since 1968. He chaired the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival for several years. He and Joann with wise counsel from Ohkay Owingeh elder and scholar, Alfonso Ortiz, and writer and scholar, Edward T. Hall founded the Chamiza Foundation in 1989 to support and stimulate Pueblo culture. Recognized by a resolution in the New Mexico House of Representatives for its work in 2009, the foundation is nationally renowned for its innovative grant support guided by a board with a majority of Pueblo members. In this and so many other efforts, Gifford touched many people, leaving us all much happier for having known him. Besides his wife, Phillips is survived by his son, James, of La Quinta, California, daughters, Alice Swistel of New York City, and Marjorie Elliott of Princeton, New Jersey, and eight grandchildren, Claire Elliott, Rosalind Elliott, Gifford Elliott, Sophia Phillips, Jackson Phillips, Lily Swistel, Nina Swistel, and Zazu Swistel."
2013-04-21T00:00:00Z,"PHILLIPS--Gifford. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the death of longtime Trustee Gifford Phillips. Gifford joined the Board of Trustees in 1966 and served on a myriad of committees over his four decade association with the Museum. He served first as Vice-Chair, then as Chair of the Painting & Sculpture Committee (1977-1989), and served on the Executive, Building and Exhibitions Committees. Additionally, Gifford was a member of the International Council since 1961. Together with his wife, Joann, Gifford was not only a generous philanthropist, but an active and passionate collector of art. Over this extraordinary period Gifford also helped build MoMA's collection by giving important works of art to the Museum such as Richard Diebenkorn's ""Berkeley, 46"", Willem de Kooning's ""Valentine"" and Ad Reinhardt's ""Abstract Painting, Red"". We send our condolences to his wife, Joann, their son James and daughters Marjorie Elliot and Alice Swistel. The Board of Trustees of The Museum of Modern Art"

With wide-ranging interests and fluent in several languages, Mr. Sherman enjoyed good talk, often lightened with humor. He was at home in many settings, but remained loyal to his origins, and to friends of all ages and backgrounds. Though he moved to Vermont only in his 60th year, he took particular pleasure in the welcome he and his partner found there. Survivors include his beloved life-mate of 28 years, Jorge Martin, whom he married in 2008; his sister, Varda Lev of Providence, R.I.; three nieces; two grandnieces and a grandnephew; and an international circle of friends."

On the first day of spring, I was walking across Central Park, nearing the West Side, in the low 80s just below the Pinetum. It was very still, with a sharp chill holding the bare tree branches fast against a pale blue sky. A woman came walking toward me on the narrow, curvy asphalt path, both of us moving briskly, minding the time. Just as we came within nodding distance, a soft fluttery call drifted faintly down from the high trees."

The Russian side, which takes place mostly in Krasnoyarsk and Novosibirsk, Siberia, includes performances and outreach programs by Illstyle & Peace Productions, a hip-hop dance company based in Philadelphia, April 19-28; an appearance by the writer and humorist Ian Frazier at the Krasnoyarsk Book Fair (Oct. 31 to Nov. 4) and an exhibition by Brooklyn artists at the Krasnoyarsk Biennial, in September.

For devoted fans of the proms, which have often offered important new works as well as standard repertory in starry performances, the station’s series is likely to be frustrating. Unlike BBC Radio 3, the BBC’s classical music arm, which broadcasts all 92 of this year’s concerts, WQXR is being selective: it is broadcasting only eight full concerts, on Saturday evenings at 5 p.m., starting on July 20. Highlights from other performances will be broadcast daily at 4 p.m."

My beloved New York Knickerbockers, Whom I do adore. You have the kind of talent, Not bought in any store. You make LeBron quiver, And Kobe breaks into a sweat. Melo buries a three, Like nobody is as wet. J.R. hits a game-winner, And stares you in the eye, Every time he does this, You should just say goodbye. When Raymond throws an alley-oop And Tyson slams it home, They do this almost every night, It chills you to the bone. When J. Kidd steals the ball from you It jumps right out of your hand, He shoots a three and nails it, And your momentum is not grand. When Shump throws a pass to you, It’ll burn off both your hands. He’ll also steal the ball from you, And do a creative jam.

2013-04-22T00:00:00Z,"When two bombs exploded at Monday’s Boston Marathon, good Samaritans of all sorts rushed in, from off-duty medical personnel to residents who opened their homes to evacuees. Tim Jones, the chief executive of Buzzient , a Boston-area social media management start-up, felt a similar urge to help, using his company’s ability to search Web history on forums, comments and social media, to focus on specific topics —  like explosives.
 
Mr. Jones also happens to be the former head of an explosives-detection company. Given his background, he jumped in when this week’s news broke — as a kind of virtual bystander. Nearly two years ago, he had offered his company’s social media monitoring tools to the Boston Police Department, pro bono. This week, his first thought was to tweak his company’s search algorithms to target online chatter about explosives, in case the police department would seek that kind of data as their investigation continued. The following is condensed and edited from an interview with Mr. Jones about his company’s volunteer efforts to assist with the investigation."

2013-04-24T00:00:00Z,"An article on Tuesday about charges against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, described incorrectly the exception to the Miranda rule that allowed him to be questioned without being told that he had a right to remain silent. It is the public safety exception, authorized by a 1984 Supreme Court decision; it is not a special Justice Department public safety exception. The article also referred incorrectly to the location of Watertown, Mass., in relationship to Boston. While the suspects were found in Watertown, several miles from the site of the marathon’s finish line in Boston, the two cities are contiguous at points; Watertown is not “about seven miles west of Boston.” And a front-page article on Sunday about the investigation into the suspected bombers erroneously stated that the cities are 10 miles apart."

The musical, which has received mixed reviews in cities on its current national tour, was scheduled to have a $12 million production on Broadway starting in August, after being delayed twice earlier. 
 
One of the musical’s producers, Thomas Viertel, said on Tuesday that the musical is now being aimed for Broadway later in the 2013-14 season. “Broadway is and has always been a tough place for new shows to succeed, and we want to get this right,” he said. “We have an incredible title and several established songs from the movie, but there may be a few too many subplots, and moments that haven’t been weighted correctly.” He said no one on the creative team is being replaced; the musical features a book by Tom Hedley and Robert Cary, music by Robbie Roth, lyrics by Mr. Cary and Mr. Roth, and direction and choreography by Sergio Trujillo (“Jersey Boys”)."
2013-04-24T00:00:00Z,"Pasta with clams, one of the recipes in Mark Bittman’s new Flexitarian column , is one of my favorite dishes and is easy as can be when it comes to wine. The combination of olive oil, garlic and clam broth boiled in a rich, briny sauce practically demands a lively, lean, high-acid, somewhat austere white. Italy is full of good examples; just distinguish between mundane industrial bottles and those made with care. Good pinot grigio, Soave or Orvieto, to name three frequently abused wines, are fine choices, as are fianos and falanghinas from Campania. Avoid oakiness and lush textures; the wines want to have snap. Alternatives from farther afield? Chablis comes immediately to mind: a fresh, young modest Chablis. You have beauty in all these combinations.
 
What would you pair with this dish? Post your suggestions in the comments below."

The decision by Mr. Baucus, 71, to forgo a seventh term brings to six the number of Senate Democrats who will not seek re-election next year, including many of the party’s most popular and venerable senators. Mr. Baucus, though, was known for frustrating Democratic leaders by opposing major party initiatives as well as his solo attempts to cut deals with Republicans.

2013-04-25T00:00:00Z,"The Broadway musical “Nice Work if You Can Get It,” a venture involving the heirs of George and Ira Gershwin and several veteran theater producers to showcase famous songs by the brothers, will close on June 15 after 27 preview performances and 478 regular performances, the producers announced on Wednesday. The Jazz Age-style show, which originally paired Tony Award winner Matthew Broderick as a playboy with Tony nominee Kelli O’Hara as a bootlegger, opened last April to mixed reviews and never caught real fire at the box office. (Ms. O’Hara’s role is now played by Tony nominee Jessie Mueller.) 
 
The musical, which cost approximately $10 million to mount on Broadway, will not recoup that original capitalization by its closing date; a spokesman for the producers said that “Nice Work” will earn back a majority of its investment, but he did not have precise figures. The show’s lead producers – Scott Landis, Roger Berlind, Sonia Friedman and Roy Furman – also announced that a national tour of the show will begin during the 2014-15 theater season."

The distribution of the information sheet comes after players said they were asked during the Scouting Combine if they liked girls. 
 
During a league investigation, the players could not recall which teams asked the questions and the league determined the comments were made in the form of informal banter and were not asked in an attempt to discern the players’ sexual orientation. But the New York Attorney General’s office asked for a meeting with league officials to discuss the matter and after those meetings, the N.F.L. decided to send out the information sheet."

If one artist embodies viral video smashes, it is Psy, the South Korean singer and rapper of “Gangnam Style.” His new song, “Gentleman,” was released two weeks ago, and immediately racked up big numbers on YouTube.

2013-04-25T00:00:00Z,"As a child, Angela Goethals had a fantasy about the 7,100-foot-long structure between Staten Island and Elizabeth, N.J., that she still calls “my bridge,” even though it no more belonged to her than the George Washington Bridge belonged to Washington’s heirs or the Lincoln Tunnel belonged to Lincoln’s.
 
The fantasy was that she and her sister would set up their own tollbooth. “It was sort of like a lemonade stand on the side of the road,” said Ms. Goethals, 35, a great-great-granddaughter of George Washington Goethals, the Army general and civil engineer for whom the bridge is named. “We thought we’d just sit there and people would pay a toll that would go into our piggy banks.”"

At the recent fashion shows, style-setters like Yasmin Sewell (in jewel tones) and Ada Kokosar (in tan leather) gave the look minimalist appeal. Note that culottes for women came about in the Victorian era so that they could ride horseback astride a man’s saddle.

He may have been the effective warm-up act for his friend Barbra Streisand, to whom he was about to present the 40th annual Chaplin Award. Yet when Mr. Clinton sauntered in, taking over host duties with the silky ease of a man accustomed to working the biggest stage in the world, there was no doubt who the biggest star in the room was. For almost anyone else, he would have been a tough act to follow.
 
But this was her night and soon after Ms. Streisand took the stage, this very special FOB (friend of Barbra) slipped into the shadows behind her, perched on a seat like a sideman waiting for his next cue. That came when, a little later, Mr. Clinton introduced Tony Bennett, whose warmly embracing rendition of “Smile” turned the hall into an intimate club, capping an evening that included Wynton Marsalis ‘s playing “Hello, Dolly!,” the very tune Louis Armstrong crooned with Ms. Streisand in the 1969 movie of the same title. Mr. Marsalis brought the cool, Mr. Bennett brought the warmth. But it was Alan Bergman , who with his wife, Marilyn, wrote some of Ms. Streisand’s signature songs, who brought the tears with his gently personalized rendition of “The Way We Were.”"

For the rest of her life, she devoted much of her energy to helping others through a multitude of charities, including Planned Parenthood, Visiting Nurse Services, the Oyster Bay-East Norwich Boys and Girls Club, the Oyster Bay Waterfront Center, Friends of the Bay and many others. She and her husband Richard (""Dick"") were leaders in creating Oyster Bay's East Woods School in 1946 and she served the school for many years. Her inquiring mind led to travel all over the world, plus regular courses at Long Island's Hutton House even into her nineties. ""Frinnie"" graduated from Chapin School in New York City and was one of Chapin's longest-serving Class Secretaries. From its purchase in 1956 to 2013, she opened her home in Cove Neck to all, welcoming anyone who asked to use the house for a fundraiser or wedding. A devoted wife to her late husband, she was a loving mother to her six children: the late Richard Jr. ""Nick"" (Jeanie) of Lunenburg, MA, Ayer Bellerman of Oyster Bay, David (Landon) of Southport, CT, Ginny Akabane (Gige) of Lenox, MA, Nancy (Jack) of St. Catharines, Canada, and Cleveland, of San Diego, CA, and enjoyed tremendously their stories of travel, sports and academic achievements.

2013-04-25T00:00:00Z,"ETTINGER--Austen A.,90, passed away on April 21, 2013. He was referred to by almost everyone he knew as a ""true gentleman."" That reflected the small things in his life--holding doors, assisting the elderly across the street, insisting on taking a breath mint while visiting the eye doctor, and saying ""thank you"" (and meaning it)--as well as all other things in his professional and personal dealings. His interests were expansive, as the Chairman of Jameson Advertising Inc., a media executive, a writer and an occasional historian. He could be very precise--he served in the Air Force when it was still the ""Air Corps"" he would note, and ""cleave"" means both ""to cling"" and ""to split"". But in many other matters being close enough was good enough, singing being a notable example. He was an observer of convention and a keen student of tradition, and yet a contrarian at times. As he wrote in The New York Times Magazine, in an article entitled ""Mum's the Word"", he and his wife (of 70 years) almost never quarreled due ""to our homegrown, unorthodox formula for tranquility...I never did believe that every question has an answer, even when professed with kindness....few issues are as important as the relationship itself, so why give them significance by giving them focus."" Or as he wrote on another occasion in the pages of the same magazine, when continuously asked after retirement if he was keeping busy, ""No, was my standard reply, 'keeping indolent."" Then he would quietly proceed with his review of the news, films, Broadway, the arts, research on the life of John Peter Altgeld or myriad other interests. He is survived and celebrated for his life by his wife, Shirley Riche Ettinger, his mother-in-law, Marjorie (Marnie) Riche Lewis, his sister, Joan Pastor, his son, John Riche Ettinger, his daughter-in-law, Linda A. Simpson, and his grandchildren, Katharine (Kaki) Simpson, John Tyler and William (Wills) Riche Ettinger. Arrangements will be private and, in lieu of flowers, contributions may be made if you wish to your favorite charity or to one of his, the Austen A. Ettinger Scholarship Fund at Yale University, P.O. Box 2038, New Haven, CT 06521."

The guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation urged the banks, including Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank, to ensure that borrowers can repay the loans, which otherwise can mire customers in debt and result in a fees that can push interest rates above 300 percent. “For too many consumers, payday and deposit advance loans are debt traps,” Richard Cordray, above, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said in a report on Wednesday.

His grandfather moved from Italy to California in 1904 to work in the wineries just north of San Francisco. In the 1940s, Mr. Sbragia’s father bought property in the Dry Creek Valley near Healdsburg and planted zinfandel grapes, which he sold to local winemakers and used for his own home wine."
2013-04-26T00:00:00Z,"“Collapse” is quite a bold title for a play that proves so trite. Built on unbelievable situations and uninspired jokes, the script holds enough humor to sustain a sitcom. But as this comedy stretches toward an hour and a half, the only thing that the title invites is an easy attempt to sum up the show.
 
As the story opens, we find the pants-less Hannah (Hannah Cabell) bent over in front of her husband, David (Elliot Villar), in what looks to be a sex act. Oh, ha ha, it’s not — after a string of sophomoric double-entendres we learn that David is giving Hannah fertility drugs. Within minutes they are interrupted by Susan (Nadia Bowers), Hannah’s wacky sister. She’s arrived from halfway across the country, unannounced, with plans to move into the couple’s home, uninvited."

2013-04-26T00:00:00Z,"ETTINGER--Austen A.,90, passed away on April 21, 2013. He was referred to by almost everyone he knew as a ""true gentleman."" That reflected the small things in his life--holding doors, assisting the elderly across the street, insisting on taking a breath mint while visiting the eye doctor, and saying ""thank you"" (and meaning it)--as well as all other things in his professional and personal dealings. His interests were expansive, as the Chairman of Jameson Advertising Inc., a media executive, a writer and an occasional historian. He could be very precise--he served in the Air Force when it was still the ""Air Corps"" he would note, and ""cleave"" means both ""to cling"" and ""to split"". But in many other matters being close enough was good enough, singing being a notable example. He was an observer of convention and a keen student of tradition, and yet a contrarian at times. As he wrote in The New York Times Magazine, in an article entitled ""Mum's the Word"", he and his wife (of 70 years) almost never quarreled due ""to our homegrown, unorthodox formula for tranquility...I never did believe that every question has an answer, even when professed with kindness....few issues are as important as the relationship itself, so why give them significance by giving them focus."" Or as he wrote on another occasion in the pages of the same magazine, when continuously asked after retirement if he was keeping busy, ""No, was my standard reply, 'keeping indolent."" Then he would quietly proceed with his review of the news, films, Broadway, the arts, research on the life of John Peter Altgeld or myriad other interests. He is survived and celebrated for his life by his wife, Shirley Riche Ettinger, his mother-in-law, Marjorie (Marnie) Riche Lewis, his sister, Joan Pastor, his son, John Riche Ettinger, his daughter-in-law, Linda A. Simpson, and his grandchildren, Katharine (Kaki) Simpson, John Tyler and William (Wills) Riche Ettinger. Arrangements will be private and, in lieu of flowers, contributions may be made if you wish to your favorite charity or to one of his, the Austen A. Ettinger Scholarship Fund at Yale University, P.O.

2013-04-27T00:00:00Z,"The four child actresses who rotate in the title role of the Broadway musical “Matilda” will not be eligible for a joint Tony Award nomination for best actress in a musical this spring, the Tony administrative committee ruled on Friday. The decision, the most newsworthy result of a busy committee meeting, sets aside a controversial precedent from 2009 when the three teenage boys sharing the lead role in “Billy Elliot” were deemed eligible for a joint best actor nomination — and went on to win that June.
 
The producers of “Matilda,” itself a front-runner for the best musical Tony this year, had sought joint eligibility for the four girls — Sophia Gennusa, Oona Laurence, Bailey Ryon and Milly Shapiro. Instead of granting that request, the Tony committee announced in a statement that the actresses would receive a special award — Tony Honors for Excellence in the Theater — “to recognize their outstanding performances this season.” As a result, none will be eligible in the best actress category."
2013-04-27T00:00:00Z,"“Here Lies Love,” the new David Byrne-Fatboy Slim musical about Imelda Marcos, which opened on Tuesday at the Public Theater to some of the best reviews of the season, has added four weeks of performances through June 30, the theater announced on Friday. The run of the musical, directed by the Tony nominee Alex Timbers (“Peter and the Starcatcher”), had already been extended twice. The 90-minute production at the Public’s LuEsther Hall has quickly become a tight ticket, in part because the space – in which most audience members stand, move and occasionally dance during the show – holds only 160 people.
 
Given the strong reviews, some New York theater producers have been predicting that the Public will run “Here Lies Love” through the summer and then try to move the musical to another, perhaps larger venue. A transfer to Broadway would be trickier, since the show’s 360-degree staging would not fit with the traditional proscenium layout of most Broadway theaters. A spokeswoman for the Public had no comment on the musical’s future beyond the latest extension."

2013-04-27T00:00:00Z,"Propelled by Deron Williams’s dribble penetration and Brook Lopez’s touch inside, the Nets’ scoring flowed steadily in their Game 1 blowout of the Chicago Bulls. But since that game’s final buzzer, the Nets’ offense has been reduced to a trickle. The Bulls have constricted Brooklyn’s options and diverted the action to its least potent offensive players.
 
 In their loss in Game 3 on Thursday , the Nets managed only 76 points and shot 34.6 percent from the field, their second worst shooting output of the season. After shooting 35.4 percent in Game 2 on Monday, it is fair to say the Nets’ offense is in a state of crisis."

This seven-room residence, No. 69B, sold for $12.25 million in 2008 and had bounced on and off the market since 2011. It had been listed for as much as $16.9 million, but sold quickly after its asking price was reduced by $1 million to $13.98 million. That, apparently, is the difference a million dollars makes at this juncture in an active market; though the 2,317-square-foot unit offered the option of buying the modernist furnishings along with the property, it was sold unfurnished."
2013-04-28T00:00:00Z,"An article last Sunday about the refusal by relatives of nine people killed during a 2010 Israeli raid of a Gaza-bound, Turkish-led flotilla to accept compensation promised by Israel until the Israeli government fully removes its restrictions on people and goods moving in and out of Gaza misidentified the country under whose flag the flotilla’s lead ship, the Mavi Marmara, was flying. It was the flag of Comoros, not Turkey. (The ship had flown under the Turkish flag at one time.)
 
Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the nature of the fighting aboard the Mavi Marmara, and it paraphrased incorrectly the Israeli assertion about how the attack had begun. It was a deadly fight; it was not a firefight because those aboard the ship were armed with weapons that included knives and sticks, but not guns. The Israelis said its commandos were attacked first; they did not say they were “fired on” first."

2013-04-28T00:00:00Z,"Though her filigree doodles of deceptively innocent-seeming flora and fauna were a fixture on the downtown gallery scene a decade ago, the artist Simone Shubuck has had only one solo show in the last six years — in 2009, at Corbett vs. Dempsey in Chicago. During that time, she married Adam Rapoport, the editor in chief of Bon Appetit magazine; became a mother; oversaw a protracted apartment renovation; and stepped away from her other career as a floral designer. Though she’s slowed her formerly frenetic output, she has continued to privately hone her technique, integrating abstract forms in pure, vibrant color. “My pace changed dramatically; I had to get to a new place in my life,” she says. “Having different identities brought me to a different place in my work.”
 
The effervescent result — the April 27 opening of “Do You Like Old Things or New Things That Look Old?” in Taylor de Cordoba’s new space in Los Angeles — is worth the wait. The show’s title is a question Shubuck once overheard from the mouth of a teenage boy, and it continues to haunt her. Working on the backs of vintage lithographed book pages, Shubuck forgoes the birds she was once known for, collaging drawings and photographs from her own past alongside loose, gestural brushwork inspired by her art-school beginnings. For the first time, some of her works also appear on large-scale sheets, intimate detail intact. The interplay between abstraction and figuration feels deeply personal, because it is. “It’s a happy and exciting tension,” Shubuck says."
2013-04-28T00:00:00Z,"The state of Georgia may soon execute Warren Lee Hill, Jr., an intellectually disabled man with an I.Q of 70. Under a 2002 Supreme Court ruling it is unconstitutional to execute him or anyone in that category — but the Constitution, in this case, may not win out.
 
Three experts concluded in 2000 that Mr. Hill was not intellectually disabled. But they have since reviewed the evidence about his mental capacity and have changed their minds. The doctor whose evaluation heavily influenced the prior finding said his work was “rushed,” “unreliable” and “in error.” He and other experts have all said that Mr. Hill is disabled, beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no question that Mr. Hill will spend his life in jail: He was convicted of murder. He is merely trying to get off death row. This week, however, by 2-1, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied Mr. Hill’s request to confirm his disability in court with new evidence. It did so because his appeal did not fit the restrictive terms of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act — in particular, that new evidence must raise doubt as to guilt, rather than the appropriateness of the punishment."
2013-04-28T00:00:00Z,"Peacocking, the preening of fastidiously dressed males of the fashion flock, has been exhaustively documented of late by international street fashion photographers who track willing prey in their natural habitats: outside fashion shows, fabulous parties and glitzy store openings where the rare birds tend to gather. The origin of this dandy species, Beau Brummel (1778-1840), and his fanciful progeny are the subject of the exhibition “Artist/Rebel/Dandy: Men of Fashion” at the Museum of Art Rhode Island School of Design , opening April 28. The curators, Kate Irvin and Laurie Brewer, from the school’s department of costume and textiles, have capitalized on this recent surge of interest in the artistry and craftsmanship of men’s wear with their study of clothing and ephemera honoring the aesthetic provocateur. Aided by an archive that includes the personal wardrobe of Richard Merkin, a legendary RISD professor, painter and dandy-in-residence, the curators constructed a thematic, rather than chronological, exploration into what they term the “always provocative dandy stance.” Delving deeper than the decorative surface, they contrast the social subversion of dandy “revolutionaries,” who express political views through their personal wardrobes, with a dandy “historian’s” appreciation of tailoring tradition, while a “connoisseur” prides self-expression over societal conformity. Thom Browne says in the accompanying catalog’s preface that “Rebellion comes from being perfectly comfortable doing my own thing and having the drive to make challenging statements in men’s wear.” According to the curators, by “kicking at the boundaries of taste,” the dandy is indeed much more than the commonly criticized “superficial person devoted only to the outer shell.”"

Although Mr. Altuzarra was friendly with the choreographer, he admitted that, out of courtesy, he had never asked too many questions and so didn’t fully know what Mr. Wheeldon did. “He said, ‘Oh, I’d love to do a ballet together,’ ” Mr. Altuzarra recalled, with a sheepish grin. “I was like, ‘Sure.’ ”
 
Suffice it to say, after more than a month of observing rehearsals and much sketching, Mr. Altuzarra is up to speed.

The production was held in a tiny basement theater in Germany, the Chemnitzer Kabarett, with less than 150 seats.

Mr. Khan’s film — like the festival’s centerpiece, “Shahid” (about Shahid Azmi , a human-rights activist and lawyer who was killed in 2010), and its closer, “Filmistaan” — concerns Hindu-Muslim relations, and the news is mostly bad. In “Dekh,” a battle plays out over a poor man’s dead body. Was the man — killed by the falling effigy of a politician, no less — a Muslim or a Hindu? Was he Hamid, as he died, or Kishan, as he was born? Should he be buried or cremated? Based on a true story, Mr. Khan’s kaleidoscopic movie finds that fertile Indian place where farce meets tragedy, with neither quite getting the upper hand. 
 
The festival also features a small sidebar celebrating the 100th anniversary of Indian film, which includes a rare chance to see the sui generis “Kalpana” (1948), a film about classical dance, told through classical dance and directed by Uday Shankar, a classical dancer (and Ravi’s brother).

 We know that stretching before exercise tends to be counterproductive because, in loosening muscles, it also temporarily weakens them. But whether you should stretch at other times — after exercise, for instance, or first thing in the morning or just before bed — is murkier, in part because studies of stretching have not been standardized. Some have had young, healthy volunteers stretch for 20 minutes or more; others for 5 minutes or less. Still others have used older, stiffer volunteers or people with existing injuries. Not surprisingly, the results have been inconsistent. Even within the same study, people respond quite differently to stretching, with some showing increased flexibility and others not."

2013-04-28T00:00:00Z,"Tourists have long flocked to the big-name designer stores along Zurich’s ritzy shopping street Bahnhofstrasse, situated on the left bank of the postcard-pretty Limmat River.

Today, it’s a lure for nature-loving residents thanks to the paved Sihlpromenade walking path lined with magnificent plane trees.

At 106, Kathryn was Wellesley's oldest known alumna; she was also one of our most beloved. For nearly 85 years, she was committed to higher education and service to her community.

On her 100th birthday, Kathryn established the 100 Projects for Peace to fund student peace-building initiatives around the world. She was a Trustee Emerita who served on the Wellesley Board from 1984 to 2002.

2013-04-28T00:00:00Z,"PEAK--Kenneth R. Kenneth R. Peak, passed away Friday, the 19th of April 2013, at age 67 after a courageous battle with brain cancer. Ken was the son of Harold Raymond ""Dutch"" and Mary Rose Peak. He was born the 17th of July 1945, in Cleves, Ohio, and grew up in nearby Frogtown. Ken was a 1963 graduate of Taylor High School and went on to earn a BS in Physics from Ohio University in 1967 and a MBA from Columbia University in 1972. He proudly served as an Officer in the United States Navy from 1968 to 1971. Ken Peak was much more than an accomplished businessman. Ken began his energy career in 1973 as a Commercial Banker in First National Bank of Chicago's energy group. His biggest success was Contango, an Oil & Gas Company that Ken started in 1999 with nothing but a desire to build a successful business for himself and his shareholders. From this idea, he built a very successful oil and gas exploration and production company, which he served as the CEO and Chairman. Prior to Contango, Ken served as a Treasurer at Tosco Corporation in 1980 and CFO at Texas International Company ('TIC') in 1982. Ken's tenure with TIC included serving as the President of TIPCO, the domestic operating subsidiary of TIC's natural gas and oil operations. Ken served as the CFO of Forest Oil Corporation from 1988 to 1989 and as an Investment Banker with Howard Weil from 1989 to 1990. He served as the President of Peak Enernomics Inc., an oil and gas consulting firm that Ken formed in 1990. Ken was also appointed to serve on the Board of Directors of AKM Enterprise Inc., NL Industries Inc., Amerac Energy Corp., and Patterson-UTI Energy. In more recent years, Ken served as the President and CEO of Contango ORE and as the Chairman of the Board for OnKure, an oncology drug company that he helped create. Besides building businesses, he built friendships that lasted a lifetime; once you were a friend of Ken's, his loyalty, good counsel, and companionship would become your biggest asset. Ken was widely known as a ""character"" in the business. He loved going to work and never had a bad day. He thought for himself and never had to check with others to make decisions as he instinctively knew what was right. Ken was a wise man, a lifelong learner and an avid reader of books, newspapers and economics newsletters. He was born with a funny bone and always tried to see a funny side of everything. His heart was the purest. Ken used his fortune to help others, and he never gave in a showy way. As a symbol of his generosity Ken and Donna Peak made a substantial donation to Methodist Hospital in Houston to established the Kenneth R. Peak Brain and Pituitary Tumor Treatment Center to continue the fight with brain illness. Ken was a man who chose to be happy all the time and he will be remembered as such. Ken Peak is irreplaceable. Ken is survived by his loving wife, Donna; daughter Mariclare Elko and husband, Chris; son Joe Peak; grandchildren Jack, Madeline, and Charlie Elko; sister Sandy Peak; brother Mike and wife, Jane Peak; four nieces; seven nephews; two aunts; and numerous cousins. The family asks that in lieu of flowers or other donations, a donation can be made to support the Kenneth R.

Pierce Laboratory in New Haven, CT and later as Senior Scientist at the Air Force Research Laboratory in San Antonio, TX, Ellie's researches illuminated the process of thrmoregulation in primates and human beings.

Her work in that area was noted especially in her 2007 award of the D'Arsonval Medal of the Bioelectromagnetic Society.

That’s the rational choice, yet what I want most is gamay, the grape of Beaujolais. Why? Back in the old days, when being able to prepare a perfect omelet was considered evidence of cooking ability, my custom for my first meal on any trip to France was to stop in at a cafe or bar à vin for an omelet, with a glass of the easygoing house Beaujolais. For me, this combination was comfort and beauty. Nowadays, I might choose a gamay from the Loire Valley, or one of the few American versions, like Edmunds St. John’s, which I think come closer to those lighthearted yet compelling wines. The rational choice? Maybe not, but it sure felt like a great one.

On Tuesday, Netflix announced that it has scheduled its next original series, “Orange Is the New Black,” a comedy-drama set in a women’s prison, to have its premiere on July 11; and, as has become its custom, it will make all thirteen episodes of the series available for viewing at once.
 
Adapted from Piper Kerman’s memoir of the same title, “Orange Is the New Black” chronicles a Brooklyn woman (played by Taylor Schilling) whose relationship with a drug runner (Laura Prepon) gets her sentenced to a year in prison. The series, which also stars Jason Biggs, Kate Mulgrew, Natasha Lyonne and Pablo Schreiber, is created by Jenji Kohan, who previously mined laughs from law-breaking women as the creator of the Showtime comedy “Weeds.”"

The governor’s demand came five days after one of the company’s directors told The New York Times that the executives were given more than $600,000 for “exemplary” performance in handling several trying events. The company, New York City’s primary utility, said those events included the hurricane late last year that left hundreds of thousands of Con Edison customers without power for at least four days."

He is known, too, for his unusual habit of going on the air and chatting about what he had to eat (and drink) the night before. Mr. Gasparino, 51, met for a late lunch at San Pietro, one of his Midtown haunts. 
 
On dining strategically “I’ve got to eat where the people I cover go. It’s good in this place, particularly at lunch. You’ll see me here — I’ll be at the bar usually. And I will have my lunch, and roam up and down. See that row of tables by the window? That’s called Chairman’s Row. It’s usually filled with John Mack and Larry Fink and Tim Geithner. Listen, I’ve done this a lot. When there’s a news-breaking thing and they’re in here? For example, when Dick Grasso won his case against Eliot Spitzer? I got a call from a patron who said, ‘Grasso’s in here, they’re having a celebratory lunch.’ So I sat there. I had my cameraman across the street. And we just waited. That’s kind of how I do my job. I figure out how information flows, and these restaurants — everybody has to go out, you know? F.B.I. agents go out. Elaine’s was a big place of mine — I was a big-time regular at Elaine’s. I was very good friends with Elaine, two or three of my books were on the wall.”"

2013-05-02T00:00:00Z,"No one had a decade of moviemaking quite like William Friedkin did in the 1970s. Starting with his 1970 film adaptation of Mart Crowley’s play “The Boys in the Band,” Mr. Friedkin, the Chicago-born and bred director, went on to make the 1971 crime drama “The French Connection,” which won the Academy Award for best picture and earned Mr. Friedkin the Oscar for best director; and the smash horror hit “The Exorcist,” which brought in nearly $200 million in its original 1973 release, and turned a generation of moviegoers off pea soup. But Mr. Friedkin finished out the decade with misfires and cinematic oddities, like “Sorcerer,” his 1977 remake of Clouzot’s “Wages of Fear”; his comic 1978 crime caper “The Brink’s Job” ; and the thriller “Cruising,” released in 1980, which starred Al Pacino as an undercover police officer investigating murders in Manhattan’s gay S&M clubs.

2013-05-02T00:00:00Z,"The round-toe, low-heel Ferragamo pump known as the Vara, distinguished by grosgrain ribbon and a gold logo buckle, is all but iconic. Designed by Fiamma Ferragamo, the daughter of the company founder, and introduced in 1978, the style, worn in the day by Princess Diana and many similarly buttoned-up women, still thrives. But today the shoes are seen on the likes of Alexa Chung or any of the 20 chic women photographed by Claiborne Swanson Frank as part of the company’s 35th-anniversary celebration of the shoe. A digital portfolio of the stylish subjects, including Jessica Hart, Olivia Palermo and the model Lily Aldridge (left, at her home in Nashville), is on Ferragamo’s new L’Icona Web site. Each is wearing her customized Vara pumps (or the similar but flat Varina). And you, too, can get in on the festivities. Go to the site and choose from a range of patent-leather colors or a summery floral, then select a bow color and heel style — there are 63 variations in all — to create the Vara or Varina of your fantasies.

Born in Portland, Maine, Al was raised by his widowed mother Mildred Brenner. Millie later married Joe Glickman and the family moved to California. Al's greatest love was his wife Judy. They met at UCLA where Al was close friends with her brother Richard. Al skillfully wooed her away from all other suitors. Al and Judy were partners in life, family, travel, and tennis. They were married for 54 years of romance and laughter, loyalty and love. He is missed by a large and loving family: children Jeff (Mindy), Tigraw, David (Paige), and Brenner (Elaine); and many grandchildren; brother Bob; and loving nieces, nephews and cousins. Al eschewed the practice of law to become a real estate broker. Soon he established his own company pioneering the community shopping center. He built islands of retail in towns throughout California and the West. The idea and the company flourished. Al had a great zeal for life. He enjoyed traveling the world, sunset cruising on his boat L'Chaim and skiing from the top of the mountain to the bottom without stopping. Through extraordinary charm and chutzpah, Al convinced the staff at Aspen Mountain to allow him to ride up the gondola each morning before the mountain opened. For years, he and four friends would enjoy the first tracks down the mountain. Wherever he lived, Al was always surrounded by friends. His magnetism was contagious while family and friends flocked to his side. Because of his sincerity, caring and insights, many, many people considered Al their best friend. Al loved action and cherished being an insider among decision-makers. He was a friend and advisor to presidents, senators, and governors. Dedicated to his community, Al had a tremendous impact on dozens of boards of charities, universities, hospitals and museums including: Cedars Sinai Hospital, Federal Home Loan Bank Board of Boston, International Council of Shopping Centers, Jewish Community Alliance, The Kennedy Center, Maine Public Broadcasting Network, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, Portland Museum of Art, Portland Symphony, Spring Harbor Hospital, Spurwink School, UCLA, University of Maine System, University of New England and the University of Southern Maine. As a leader in the Michael J. Fox Foundation, Al focused his energies and resources in the pursuit of finding a cure for Parkinson's Disease, knowing the benefit was for future generations, not himself. Notwithstanding his immense accomplishments, family was always his highest priority. Al prided himself on being home for dinner with the family every night. He created a family retreat on Great Diamond Island in Maine, where his kids and grandkids reunite every summer. From humble beginnings, Al created a life that was extraordinary. He leaves a legacy of generosity and goodness. His family, friends, and community will forever feel blessed. Please send your support to the Michael J. Fox Foundation."

Stephanie's passion for music began early in life and was encouraged by her loving Greek family. Her father James had The Bay Ridge Dining Room and he and his wife Katherine (Sidereas) could not do enough for their children. While her friends played outside on Saturday afternoons, Stephanie stayed indoors listening to opera under the guise of doing chores for her beloved mother. After attending the Mannes School of Music, Stephanie began a singing career which spanned opera, lieder, Greek Folk Songs and Negro Spirituals on BBC Radio. She sang in the US and Europe including debuts in New York's Town Hall and London's Wigmore Hall and gave many concerts for wounded WWII soldiers. Her happiest years were raising her daughters and they both survive her. Karen Scourby D'Arc who immortalized her mother in a children's book, ""My Grandmother Is a Singing Yaya"" and Pamela D'Arc Corwin with her husband Andrew Corwin gave her the cherished grandchildren who adored her and in whose lives she was deeply involved: Katherine and Alexander Corwin. Generations of students will carry on the life's work of their loving teacher and mentor, Miss Scourby. She used her brilliant technique not only to teach opera singers and Broadway actors, but to restore speaking to survivors of strokes and Parkinson's. In the 1960's, she was also the underground teacher for students from the Juilliard and the singing teacher for 20th Century Fox's program to develop young artists. The last five years of her life she was able to remain at home, still teaching, looked after by her daughter Karen. We'd love to hear from people with memories to share. Please call or go to www.legacy.com. Funeral to be held Monday, May 6, Viewing 11am, Service 12 noon at Sts Constantine & Helen Greek Orthodox Cathedral, 64 Schermerhorn Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201.

2013-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Performances of the Broadway play “The Nance” will be extended by eight weeks through August 11, Lincoln Center Theater announced on Thursday, aiming to capitalize on the Tony Award nomination this week for lead actor Nathan Lane. 
 
The show received four Tony nominations for design contributions as well, though not a best play nomination for the playwright, Douglas Carter Beane. The play, which opened to good reviews in April, is about the personal and professional travails of a gay New Yorker (played by Mr. Lane) who performs in a 1930s burlesque theater as a nance, a brazenly effeminate stock character. The production by the nonprofit Lincoln Center Theater has been selling well; it took in $445,409 last week, or 60 percent of the maximum possible gross, a solid amount for a play."

Mr. Albee’s work was originally to have had its world premiere as part of the Off Broadway company’s 2011-12 season – its first at the Pershing Square Signature Center, its new Midtown space – but was postponed when the famously self-critical playwright, now 85, decided that it needed revamping.
 
In place of Mr. Albee’s work, the company will present the world premiere of “The Old Friends,” a new work by Horton Foote. The play, about two Texas farming families who find themselves at odds, will be directed by Michael Wilson, and will have Betty Buckley, Hallie Foote and Lois Smith in its cast.

In its first season in 2012, “Veep,” created by Armando Iannucci (the author of the political satires “The Thick of It” and “In the Loop”) was an Emmy nominee for outstanding comedy; Ms. Louis-Dreyfus, an Emmy winner for her performances on “Seinfeld” and “The New Adventures of Old Christine,” earned her third such award for portraying the “Veep” title character, Selina Meyer. “Veep” was just three episodes into its second season (which started on April 14) when HBO announced its latest renewal.

While a few Tony voters have been heard grousing over drinks at theater district hangouts, a spokesman for “I’ll Eat You Last” said on Thursday that many voters were understanding and had decided to purchase seats to see Ms. Midler, in her first role on Broadway since “Fiddler on the Roof” in the late 1960s."

But beginning this month the Swiss artist Thomas Hirschhorn , with the help of the Dia Art Foundation , will build the last in a series of temporary monuments at the Forest Houses, a New York City Housing Authority development in the Morrisania neighborhood of the Bronx.
 
Called “The Gramsci Monument,” the work – which will take the form of a kind of temporary pavilion built on the grounds of the housing project – will be the fourth such monument Mr. Hirschhorn has built over the last several years, dedicated to writers and philosophers – like Spinoza, Gilles Deleuze and Georges Bataille – whose ideas have inspired him. Antonio Gramsci was an Italian political theorist and Marxist who was imprisoned for many years under Mussolini. “The Gramsci Monument” will be the first such installation in the United States by Mr. Hirschhorn, who said he had chosen the site because of his desire to “create a new form” of public art, “based on love for a ‘non-exclusive audience.’ ”"
