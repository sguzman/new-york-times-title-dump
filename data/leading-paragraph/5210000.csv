Most are pre-Columbian, the rest are African or Melanesian and all were drawn from the college's Testut-Obstfield Collection.

The misadventures of a group of going-nowhere teen-agers in Jill Eisenstadt's first novel, ''From Rockaway,'' would seem to confirm every parent's worst nightmares about what his or her children do when left to their own devices.

Soft and deep-set above the high Slavic cheekbones, they seem by far the strongest of her tools as an actress. For her last two films, first the 1985 Soviet film ''Winter Cherries'' and now the widely admired Italian-Soviet offering, ''Dark Eyes,'' they have given her a way to evoke eloquently and almost silently the emotions of a charming and charmable woman who wants something more out of life than charm."
