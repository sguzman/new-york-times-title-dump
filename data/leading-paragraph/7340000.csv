As the fashion blogger Garance Doré put it, they are ''the official footwear of the coolest girls I know.'' Not surprisingly, they are also some of the hardest to come by -- or, at least, were. Once available only at Vivienne Westwood shops (the closest? London), they are now being sold on Net-a-porter. The online retailer has three styles: black suede with black leather straps; black suede with tan leather straps; and a tan suede with tan leather straps that, alas, has already sold out. But the site promises that more stock is on its way. Vivienne Westwood Pirate boots, $510 at netaporter.com."

(Discovery, Animal Planet) LIFEOprah Winfrey narrates this 11-part nature series, which explores the adaptability and diversity of life on earth -- culling among the 30 million or so animal and plant species here -- from the spectacular to the downright bizarre. Images were captured in high definition using equipment like a ''yogi cam,'' which can track smoothly alongside migrating reindeer and elephants, and an intricate cable rigging that enabled crews to ''fly'' a camera through thousands of monarch butterflies. The survey begins with ''Challenges of Life,'' which explores survival strategies like those of the stalk-eyed fly, which inflates its head to impress females; Kenyan cheetahs who band together to hunt large prey; and monkeys in Brazil that use tools resembling a hammer and anvil to crack nuts. ''Reptiles and Amphibians,'' at 9, shows a pebble toad escaping a tarantula by bouncing down a rock face; a basilisk lizard running on water; a chameleon snatching its prey with its tongue; and the savage hunting techniques of the Komodo dragon.

On any other morning, a police presence would have meant more bad news: in a city that has one of the highest homicide rates in the United States, this neighborhood -- roughly a mile from the French Quarter -- has a murder rate that, in recent years, has hit quadruple that of the city as a whole. This morning, however, the 20 drivers, as well as 80 other crew members who hefted and humped a boggling array of gear at the tumbledown corner of Second Street and South Liberty, had anything but murder in mind: they were six hours into a day of filming the third episode of ''Treme,'' David Simon's new HBO drama -- co-created by the seasoned television writer and producer Eric Overmyer -- which is set in post-Katrina New Orleans and will make its debut on April 11. The production was only two scenes into the six on the call sheet; at that pace, they were looking at a 15-hour marathon -- yet another in the 11-day ultramarathon that shooting an hour of episodic television on location can demand. As the novelist George Pelecanos, a staff writer on ''Treme,'' told me of the years he spent on set as a writer-producer on ''The Wire,'' Simon's breakthrough series: ''If you got out with a 12-hour day, that was the luckiest day of the series. Try doing that for seven months straight. Only young people can do it. You don't see many people in their 50s carrying around lights.''"

An exclusive private school? A secret society? These letters were all over Bergen County, and inquiring minds (my own) wanted to know -- what was OBX and how could I get some? When I finally figured out the code -- the abbreviation is for the Outer Banks of North Carolina -- I began to notice other oval stickers: LBI, DRB, MTK, all representing cool beach towns I had never visited. But at least other lucky drivers had been to Long Beach Island or Delray Beach or Montauk, probably on a regular basis. Perhaps a few even have an amazing second home in DRB or OBX."

''Go ahead, stomp around in your heels.''

2010-03-21T00:00:00Z,"CAVE HOME, FESTUS, MO.In 2003, Curt and Deborah Sleeper and their two children were living in a cramped Missouri ranch house when they saw an eBay offering for three acres with an empty sandstone cave. They planned to build on the land, but they soon began to imagine the benefits of living like bears. The former sandstone quarry offered 15,000 square feet of naturally insulated space -- ample room for a pool table and even a basketball court -- and would eliminate the family's heating and cooling bills. The Sleepers lived under tents in the rear of the cave while they built the house themselves. They did laundry in buckets while Curt drafted the architectural plans; the family hammered, sanded and laid tile together. The finished home feels ''very private, very peaceful and nurturing,'' Deborah says. ''The inside of the house feels like you're outdoors without the discomfort of hot or cold.'' There are some unique challenges to living in the cave: three industrial-size dehumidifiers are needed to pump out roughly 60 gallons of water every day (which are redirected to an outdoor irrigation system), and the bare walls shed sand. The Sleepers have placed large umbrellas or interior roofs over areas like the kitchen that need to stay sand-free -- not least of all for the couple's 1-year-old son, Wes. WATER-TOWER APARTMENT, ESSEN, GERMANYA decade ago, the architects Arnim Koch and Michael Dahms were working on a project for the municipal utility of Essen, Germany, when they became enamored with a stately 1905 water tower in a wooded area to the south of the city. The tower had become obsolete, and the architects pooled their money to purchase it. The pair set about designing eight floors into the tower's base, which are now home to two rental apartments, a real estate agency and a communications business. Thomas Kalthoff, a young financial adviser, lives on the fourth and fifth floors of the converted tower with his girlfriend, Katharina, and his cat, Oskar. ''I see my apartment as a nice counterbalance to my work life,'' Kalthoff said. ''My daily work is not so surprising.'' Dahms and Koch's design recalls the building's industrial past but also reshapes it. Custom-designed cabinetry accommodates the tower's sloping walls, which narrow as they rise toward the former water tank. There are exposed concrete interiors but also floor-to-ceiling windows that offer sweeping views from Kalthoff's apartment when storms roll in. ''The most pride we take,'' Koch says, ''is that we were able to breathe life into something that had no use.'' PHOTOGRAPHS BY LARS TUNBJORK FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES"

2010-03-21T00:00:00Z,"FIERTZ--Beverly Fowle, South Woodstock, VT. Married to high school sweetheart, raised three sons, resided 20 years in Germany and Switzerland, earned a law degree at age 55, and served on numerous Woodstock, VT area community boards, Bev Fiertz lived life fully during her 78 years that concluded on Monday, March 8. She successfully fought various ailments over the past years, but unexpectedly died at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center during heart surgery. The daughter of Margaret and Edwin Fowle, Bev was born in Flushing, NY on May 6, 1931, and grew-up in Manhasset, NY. A proud member of Manhasset High School '49, she graduated from Wheaton College (MA) in 1953. In 1954, she married Alden Fiertz, whom she had met in 9th grade French class. After she gave birth to three sons, the family moved from Ramsey, NJ to Duesseldorf, Germany in 1968, to Lausanne, Switzerland in 1972 and then to Geneva in 1979. Later, frustrated by the exploitation of several female friends by the legal system, she decided to fulfill a long-standing desire to become a lawyer even though it had been 30 years since she attended college. Bev graduated in 1986 from Vermont Law School, the first of ultimately many senior students. She always appreciated the warm reception from her classmates, despite their differences in age and experience. After passing the Vermont Bar Exam on her first try, Bev worked for Vermont Legal Aid before opening her law practice in South Woodstock, VT with a focus on serving low-income victims of domestic abuse. In addition to being an avid skier and tennis player, she enjoyed painting and sculpting. She was also an intrepid traveler, who visited all seven continents, and was fluent in both French and German. She particularly enjoyed her three visits each to the Arctic and Antarctica. She was dedicated to each of the communities she lived in and volunteered on many boards. These included such roles as President of the American Women's Clubs of Duesseldorf and Lausanne, a six year Trustee of Wheaton College, appointed Chair of the Vermont Human Services Board by Governor Dean, Chair of The South Woodstock Fire Department, Secretary of the Ottaqueechee Health Foundation, and as member of the boards of The New Hampshire Charitable Foundation-Upper Valley Region, the Faulkner Trust, and Woodstock's Thompson Senior Center. She proudly represented Wheaton College at the recent inauguration of Dr. Jim Yong Kim as Dartmouth College President. Her beloved husband Alden survives Bev, as do her sons Carey of Salisbury, CT, Randy of Bethesda, MD, and Stuart of London, England, and their wives Kim, Carol and Tina. She leaves behind seven grandchildren: Charles, Henry, Maggie, Katja, Callie, Mimi, and Louisa, and sister Janis Bigelow of Cotuit, MA, brother Bruce Fowle of New York City, and their families. A celebration of Bev's life is planned for a later date when her treasured garden is in bloom. Memorial contributions may be made to either an educational fund being established in her name at The Upper Valley Haven, 713 Hartford Avenue, White River Junction, VT 05001 or to the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Vermont, 137 Elm Street, Montpelier, VT 05402."

2010-03-21T00:00:00Z,"AT first glance ''How to Train Your Dragon,'' the new action-adventure film from DreamWorks Animation based on the whimsical children's book by Cressida Cowell, does not seem to share much with the Coen brothers' ''No Country for Old Men'' or M. Night Shyamalan's ''Village.'' But a closer look reveals some similarities. From washed-out landscapes to minimally lighted rooms, the Nordic locations in ''Dragon'' feel more lived in and rough edged -- more realistic -- than one typically finds in animation. This comes from the influence of an outsider, the Oscar-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins. Best known for his work on ''A Beautiful Mind,'' ''The Shawshank Redemption'' and Coen brothers' films, Mr. Deakins had little experience working in animation, save for some consulting on ''Wall-E.'' But as the co-directors of ''Dragon,'' Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders (''Lilo & Stitch''), were thinking of a way to distinguish their film from other animated work, they decided to bring in someone who could see light in a different way. Below Mr. Deakins, Mr. DeBlois and Mr. Sanders discuss how they achieved the film's look."

He was born in Brooklyn and educated at Poly Prep, Deerfield Academy and Yale. Joining the Navy during WWII, he became the youngest commander of a commissioned ship, the SC1038, which was active in the Pacific theater. Graduating from Columbia Law School in 1949, he eventually entered public service as the Assistant Attorney General of New York in the Saratoga County Investigation. In 1953 he was appointed an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York, participating in the successful prosecution of mobster Frank Costello. In 1955 he became Chief of the Criminal Division of the office, later the Chief Assistant and then was appointed United States Attorney in 1958. His last case was the successful prosecution of Vito Genovese, alleged head of the Mafia, on drug charges. Entering private practice, he practiced first with his father in Christy, Frey & Christy, and then formed the firm of Christy & Viener in 1976. In 1979 he was named the first Special Prosecutor under the Ethics in Government Act, investigating allegations made against Hamilton Jordan, then Chief of Staff to President Jimmy Carter.

2010-03-21T00:00:00Z,"ERICKSON--Nancee, passed away on Friday, March 12th, 2010 at her home in San Francisco, CA. She is survived by her beloved husband John, her two sons Nelson and Justin, her daughter-in-law, Betsy, her mother Marilyn Singer, her two brothers Richard and Donald, sisters-in-law, Martha, Lori and Mary, her three nieces, Edie, Zinnia and Arden, as well as by her cousins, godchildren and numerous loving friends throughout the world. Nancee was a loving wife, a devoted mother, a wonderful friend, and an elegant hostess, always with an endearing smile, warm heart, and quick wit. She delighted in bringing people together to build new friendships for herself and others. Nancee's artistry and personal contributions have had a deep and lasting influence on the communities where she lived. She will long be remembered for her contributions. Born in San Francisco on Veterans Day, 1947, Nancee and her brothers were raised in Portland, OR. Always with a great fondness for the fine arts, Nancee graduated with a degree in art history from Scripps College in Claremont, CA. She took this passion to Boston, MA, where she pursued a doctoral degree through programs at Harvard and Boston University and taught art history courses to college-level students. She met her husband John in Boston, and soon after their marriage in 1972 they began a life together in San Francisco where she continued her doctoral studies at Stanford University. In addition to being a full-time mother, homemaker, and gourmet chef, Nancee devoted her time, creativity, and imagination to a number of social and cultural causes in San Francisco, on Nantucket Island, and elsewhere. Nancee became deeply involved with community organizations, including the Junior League and Enterprise for High School Students (EHSS), a city-wide youth development agency that guides teens in exploring career interests, finding and retaining jobs and experiential learning. Together with her good friend, Toby Rose, Nancee co-founded the San Francisco Fall Antiques Show in 1981, establishing the show as the major fundraising event for EHSS. The San Francisco Fall Antiques Show continues today as the oldest continuously operating international antiques show on the West Coast. Aside from her work with EHSS, Nancee also held board positions with the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, Fort Mason Center, and the Town and Country Club. Nancee was also committed to educational causes. She involved herself deeply in her sons' schools, was an active member of Achievement Rewards for College Sciences (ARCS), and was a champion for special education programs. Most recently, Nancee devoted much of her time to the Children's Theatre Association of San Francisco. Nancee delighted in cultivating new artistic talents. She was a gifted needleworker, teacher and collector of fine decorative arts. Her elaborate pieces adorn her home as well as the Christmas trees of friends and family. Nancee also wove beautiful lightship baskets during her summers on Nantucket. Her passion for the arts led her to work closely with the Nantucket Historical Association (NHA) to create the 1800 House, which is at the heart of the NHA's educational program, a program dedicated to celebrating and reviving Nantucket's rich tradition in historic decorative arts and crafts. Nancee endeared herself to many during her short yet fruitful life. Although she is no longer with us, her impeccable taste, vibrant spirit, and resplendent personality will continue to touch and inspire the lives of everyone from her immediate family to those she met while walking her beloved golden retrievers on the shores of Crissy Field in San Francisco and the Tuppancy Links on Nantucket Island. The care and love she showered on her husband and sons will be missed. A memorial service will be held at 3pm on Thursday, March 25th at Grace Cathedral and also during the Summer on Nantucket. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to the Nantucket Historical Association with a specific designation to the 1800 House (P.O. Box 1016, Nantucket, MA 02554; 508-228-1894).

Sometimes I skip school to do it but don't tell my parents. I've been to Qinghai, Guangxi, but never to Beijing, because I thought it was too boring, with nothing to see. I came because I recently saw a movie called 'Summer Palace,' and there was the most beautiful scene, really short, set at the lake in the Summer Palace. So I decided I really wanted to come row a boat in this lake. I didn't know it was going to be frozen over! I came with a friend, who got lazy and went to find coffee. I trudged down to the lake by myself, got mud all over my shoes, and just lay down. The ice really stabbed into my back. On the train ride back to Chengdu, I decided I don't want to be a doctor anymore. It is a very difficult profession, and I didn't think it through clearly when I decided to go to medical school.

They were married March 24, 1956, and she came to the United States shortly thereafter. Subsequently, she worked several years in the laboratories of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, prior to raising a family.

2010-03-21T00:00:00Z,"CAVE HOME, FESTUS, MO.In 2003, Curt and Deborah Sleeper and their two children were living in a cramped Missouri ranch house when they saw an eBay offering for three acres with an empty sandstone cave. They planned to build on the land, but they soon began to imagine the benefits of living like bears. The former sandstone quarry offered 15,000 square feet of naturally insulated space -- ample room for a pool table and even a basketball court -- and would eliminate the family's heating and cooling bills. The Sleepers lived under tents in the rear of the cave while they built the house themselves. They did laundry in buckets while Curt drafted the architectural plans; the family hammered, sanded and laid tile together. The finished home feels ''very private, very peaceful and nurturing,'' Deborah says. ''The inside of the house feels like you're outdoors without the discomfort of hot or cold.'' There are some unique challenges to living in the cave: three industrial-size dehumidifiers are needed to pump out roughly 60 gallons of water every day (which are redirected to an outdoor irrigation system), and the bare walls shed sand. The Sleepers have placed large umbrellas or interior roofs over areas like the kitchen that need to stay sand-free -- not least of all for the couple's 1-year-old son, Wes. WATER-TOWER APARTMENT, ESSEN, GERMANYA decade ago, the architects Arnim Koch and Michael Dahms were working on a project for the municipal utility of Essen, Germany, when they became enamored with a stately 1905 water tower in a wooded area to the south of the city. The tower had become obsolete, and the architects pooled their money to purchase it. The pair set about designing eight floors into the tower's base, which are now home to two rental apartments, a real estate agency and a communications business. Thomas Kalthoff, a young financial adviser, lives on the fourth and fifth floors of the converted tower with his girlfriend, Katharina, and his cat, Oskar. ''I see my apartment as a nice counterbalance to my work life,'' Kalthoff said. ''My daily work is not so surprising.'' Dahms and Koch's design recalls the building's industrial past but also reshapes it. Custom-designed cabinetry accommodates the tower's sloping walls, which narrow as they rise toward the former water tank. There are exposed concrete interiors but also floor-to-ceiling windows that offer sweeping views from Kalthoff's apartment when storms roll in. ''The most pride we take,'' Koch says, ''is that we were able to breathe life into something that had no use.'' PHOTOGRAPHS BY LARS TUNBJORK FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES"

The louder Republicans yell, the more they will be characterized and caricatured as sore losers infuriated by the first major delivery of candidate Obama's promise of ""change."" ... But fighting back against a supposedly hostile press is old hat for the GOP. A far greater challenge will come from a new quarter. Large segments of the American business community are going to present a formidable ally for Obamacare, either with outspoken support or notable silence. From businesses that have been crushed by rising health care costs, to pharmaceutical companies cleverly co-opted by the White House early on in the process, to the doctors' organizations (including the American Medical Association) that endorsed the final product, to, yes, even the vilified insurance companies - none of these entities are going to join the charge to reverse the new reality of U.S. health care, and many will make it clear that they are resigned to or actually in favor of the apparently inevitable conclusion."""

It is the first time that a gospel album has been in the Top 10 since November 2008, when ""The Sound"" from Mary Mary reached No. 7, according to Billboard. It credits the sleeper radio success of Mr. Sapp's 2007 song ""Never Would Have Made It"" with the new album's sales. (""Thirsty,"" the album that contained ""Never Would Have Made It,"" peaked at No. 28.)Also on this week's chart, Lady Antebellum's ""Need You Now"" (Capitol Nashville) returns to No. 1 for a fourth time with sales of 93,000, bringing its eight-week total to just under 1.5 million.

I enjoyed Alexandra Jacobs's piece about Polyvore in the style issue of The New Yorker. (I also was excited to see the piece on Brunello Cucinelli; interesting business, with annual sales of more than $200 million, reports RebeccaMead, and I know a lot of women who like the clothes, expensive though they are. But I was bored reading about him.) One thing in the Polyvore piece that amused me was the description of the company's office, the atmosphere of tact and friendliness - unlike magazine offices which, as Ms. Jacobs noted, ""are widely perceived to be snake pits."" But looking at clothes and brands and trends on a computer screen is a different experience, isn't it? Magazines are diva pits, flesh-and-blood places, and they are probably less so today than 10 or 20 years ago, and of course that outsized feeling and passion for clothes is what helps stir the imagination of designers and editors alike. I guess things are thinning out now, and not just magazine pages. Polyvore is a useful site for people, but it does, as Ms. Jacobs's reporting suggested, reflect a remote, blunt, user-friendly time."

(And that's without getting into the tangled issue of community health centers.) But what struck me most, at the end, wasn't the folly of Stupak's decision to compromise his pro-life principles by voting ""yes,"" but the extraordinary loneliness of his position before he folded."

Nomvuho Mzamane ran the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa at its founding in 2007 but left after students there said they were being abused by another staff member. After Ms. Winfrey held a news conference and said that Ms. Mzamane had ignored the students' complaints, Ms. Mzamane said Ms. Winfrey had defamed her and made it difficult for her to find another job. A statement from lawyers representing both women said the dispute had been settled ""peacefully to their mutual satisfaction"" and both women had withdrawn their complaints, according to Reuters. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A trial was scheduled to begin on Monday in federal court in Philadelphia, where Ms. Mzamane was living when she filed the suit."

Some prisoners may be released early for completing drug or education programs. Part of the plan includes changing how the state handles parolees, many of whom, at the moment, return to prison on technical violations, according to criminal system experts. California is the only state that places all prisoners on parole at release, but now hundreds of low-level offenders will be released without close supervision from their parole officers. The effort represents a ""seismic shift,"" said Joan Petersilia, a criminologist at Stanford Law School and a longtime scholar of the state's prisons. The prison system costs the state $8 billion annually, about 11 percent of the state budget. [The New York Times]"

In preparation, both sides filed court memorandums on Tuesday. Prosecutors recommended that Arenas serve three months in jail, according to The Washington Post. Arenas pleaded guilty on Jan. 15 to storing four unloaded guns in the Wizards' locker room at the Verizon Center, and using them in a joke with his teammate Javaris Crittenton. As part of his plea agreement, prosecutors filed only a single gun possession charge. The Post reported that the Assistant United States Attorney Christopher R. Kavanaugh was seeking a jail sentence because Arenas provided inconsistencies in his dealings with prosecutors and showed little remorse other than how the incident impacted his career. ''If any other individual without fame, power and the wealth of this defendant, brought four firearms into the District for the purpose of a similar confrontation, the government would seek their incarceration and the court would almost certainly give it,'' Kavanaugh wrote, according to The Post."

Phyllis worked for 30 years as an assistant to the chairman of James Felt Realty Services. She was a passionate sailor, gardener, collector, reader, and companion to her husband, truly a ""woman for all seasons"". The family thanks her amazing friend and caregiver, Elieze Charles, for the love and skill that cushioned the last difficult year of Phyllis's life. A Memorial Service will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street on Sunday March 28 at 2:30 o'clock.

Hauser & Wirth represents the estate of the sculptor Eva Hesse (1936-70), and assembled on the table were essentially outtakes from her studio- delicate, insistently handmade studies in papier-caché (a version of papier-mâché), cheesecloth and bits of adhesive. Not quite works in their own right, they were still riveting in their suggestion of themes that had preoccupied Hesse throughout her decade-long career (cut short by her death from brain cancer at age 34): plasticity, an engagement with ephemeral materials, the elusive and incomplete nature of memory, and a redolent corporeality."

And this was all just the first dish. Brunch at Hoof Café - the new offshoot of Grant van Gameren and Jen Agg's Black Hoof, across the street - is a decidedly meat-focused affair. Stranger than this strange assemblage, which also included more blueberries and some syrup and - why not? - candied celery and which seemed to suggest the chefs were smoking more than cheese, was the fact that it all sort of worked. Not brilliant, but sweet and smoky and meaty and an oddly comforting way to begin the first meal of the day.

While I was there last September, I saw dust maps that gave the Top End most of Australia north of the Tropic of Capricorn - about a third of the continent.

But the police are reaching their long-awaited economic summit when the city is in an economic abyss. Gerry Shih reports that with a  record $522 million budget gap facing the city, some in city government are pushing for the police to give up the 4 percent raise scheduled to take effect July 1 or to face layoffs that could result in a $17 million savings. Despite recent sharp cuts in controversial overtime payments, total police compensation has been rising for the past five years, city data show. In 2009, 52 members officers and members of the command staff took home more than $200,000, with one retiring deputy chief taking home more than $500,000. ""When I sit down with my constituency,"" said Supervisor David Campos, who was on the police commission before running for district office, ""the feeling I get is they want the police, but they don't want the police being the best compensated in the country when we're shutting down gyms and pools."""

2010-03-26T00:00:00Z,"LUND--Theresa M. Died at home in Jupiter, FL, on March 17, 2010 at the age of 69, after a seven year struggle with PSP (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy). During that time she was an inspiration to all who knew her or came in contact with her. Theresa, known to her children, grandchildren and friends as Tzippi, lived a full and fascinating life. She was married for nearly 50 years to Peter A. Lund, the former CEO of CBS. After meeting in the fifth grade and growing up together in Minneapolis, MN, the two of them, along with their sons, Mark and Tim, began an odyssey that included 13 moves and some wonderful adventures. Tzippi was eclectic in her interests and pursuits. As they moved about the country she was, at various times, a yoga instructor, travel agent, banker, hotel sales agent, photographer and small business entrepreneur. She was an avid hiker and with her good pals she trekked in Nepal, hiked portions of the Appalachian Trail, the mountains of Vermont and Colorado and at one point walked across England. In between trips she was a skier, golfer, tennis player, bridge player and still found time to read two or three books every week. But, clearly her greatest accomplishment was the way she handled the last seven years of her life. From the time she was diagnosed with PSP until she died, she never complained. Even during the past several years, when she couldn't talk or move anything except the fingers of her left hand, she would signal yes when asked if she was happy. A truly remarkable woman who was a gift to the wonderful group of friends who were part of her life until the very end. Theresa is survived by her husband, Peter; her two sons, Mark of NBC in New York and Tim of Arnold Advertising in Boston; and her seven grandchildren, Connor, Kelly, Jack, Maxwell, Olivia, Nathan and Charlotte; and her two sisters, Kathy and Patti. A Mass of Christian Burial will be Celebrated 10am, Monday, March 29, 2010 at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. Memorial contributions may be made in Theresa's name to, CurePSP, Foundation for PSP/CBD and related brain diseases, Executive Plaza III, 11350 McCormick Road, Suite 906, Hunt Valley, MD 21031."

Tennessee's top two scorers, Scotty Hopson and Wayne Chism, have also been uneven. Northern Iowa's Ali Farokhmanesh, who hit the upset-clinching 3-pointer against No. 1 Kansas, leads the Panthers in 3-pointers with 76 (on 37.8 percent shooting). When Kalin Lucas tore his Achilles' tendon, Michigan State lost its leader in scoring and assists.

2010-03-26T00:00:00Z,"McGRAW--Harold W.,Jr. The Board of Trustees and Staff of Darien Library mourn the loss of a steadfast and generous supporter, esteemed leader, thoughtful mentor and beloved friend. Harold W. McGraw, Jr. served as Trustee from 1951 to 1957 and 1968 to 1974. He was President of the Library Board from 1953 to 1957 and from 1970 to 1972 and was named an Honorary Trustee in 1977. His leadership of the capital campaign for construction of the first Darien Library in 1957 caused a fellow trustee to remark that Harold McGraw ""almost single handedly got the library built."" In 1972-74 he led the campaign to expand the building by constructing a new children's wing, which was named in honor of the McGraw family. He was Honorary Co-Chairman of the capital campaign that resulted in construction of the New Darien Library, whose opening was celebrated on January 10, 2009, his 91st birthday, with thousands of visitors singing ""Happy Birthday"" to him. Harold seldom visited the new building without stopping by the McGraw Children's Library, named in his honor. His support of the engagement, education and entertainment of children was unwavering; it reflected his commitment to the important role of public libraries from the beginning to the end of the life of each person in the community. To his family, especially Sue, Terry and Robert, we express our sorrow for their loss, tempered only by our belief that his great good kindness, his generosity and his unwavering friendship to so many have set an enduring example of all that is best in human nature. To the memory of Harold W. McGraw, Jr., generous with his support, advice, leadership and, above all, friendship-we pledge that we will never forget the lessons he taught us, and we promise that the Darien Library will always reflect his enduring values of intelligence, common sense, enterprise, commitment and integrity."

DeMarcus Cousins was a handful for Cornell, and he probably will be for West Virginia, too. But the Mountaineers' biggest concerns are injury-related. The loss of point guard Darryl Bryant (broken foot) leaves them thin in the backcourt against Kentucky's John Wall and Eric Bledsoe, and the star forward Da'Sean Butler injured his right hand in a fall against Washington. Butler packed his hand in ice after practice on Friday."

Born in Brooklyn, NY on December 22, 1925, Ken proudly attended Union College and joined the Navy during WWII where he rose to the rank of Lieutenant JG. After the War, he followed in his father's footsteps and joined W. E. Dean & Company as a commercial real estate broker in lower Manhattan. At that time, lower Manhattan consisted of tea and coffee warehouses and ship chandlers eventually evolving into the financial capital of the world. In the mid sixties he merged with Cushman & Wakefield, Inc. where he continued a very successful career and was often referred to as ""Mr. Downtown."" He resided in Garden City, NY with a summer home in Quogue, NY before retiring in 1994 to Palm Beach Gardens, FL and Quogue. Ken loved life, the New York Jets and enjoyed golf, biking, swimming, fishing and spending time with family and friends.

Mr. Ryskamp served with extraordinary distinction as Director of the Frick from June 1987 until September 1997, and continued to serve as an advisor until very recently. During his tenure at the Frick, the institution underwent profound evolution. He expanded the special exhibition program, developed new gallery spaces, enhanced the publications program, strengthened the Collection with new art works, and built broader-based support among existing constituencies, while making countless new friends for the Frick. His tireless efforts to stabilize the finances of the Frick Art Reference Library ensured its enduring presence in the world of art history research. His deep knowledge of literature and art informed every aspect of his leadership of the institution, where his commitment to scholarship and connoisseurship remain the touchstones of our mission. Previously seen as a staid and static museum, Mr. Ryskamp found ways to energize the institution without losing sight of its high standards and unique place in the art world. His tireless, ever-engaging, larger-than-life persona drew a widening audience into the Frick circle, and set the course for expanding our outreach to a broader visitorship. He will be remembered for his passionate love of art, for his dedication to ensuring the strength and stability of the institution, as a gifted connoisseur, and for his wisdom, warmth and marvelous wit. He will be deeply missed. Margot C. Bogert, Chair Anne L. Poulet, Director"

Other dictators have taken an interest in cinema as a propaganda tool -- Stalin exploited Sergei Eisenstein and Hitler hired Leni Riefenstahl -- but Mr. Kim has gone further. The Dear Leader, as he is called, is the author of the textbook cum manifesto ''On the Art of the Cinema.'' He has been known to function as a hands-on mogul in the state-run film industry, rewriting scripts and nurturing pet projects. In 1978 -- while running the propaganda department under his father, Kim Il-sung, the country's founding president -- he even arranged the kidnapping of Shin Sang-ok, a South Korean director, whom he tasked with improving the quality of North Korean movies."

It returns on Monday (ABC Family, 8 p.m.) with the squabbling Stratford sisters, Bianca (Meaghan Martin) and Kat (Lindsey Shaw), each caught up in a crisis: Bianca needs to destroy the evidence of her kiss with the ex-boyfriend of Padua High School's queen bee, Chastity (Dana Davis), while Kat needs to sneak into school during her one-day suspension to take a crucial exam. Ms. Martin remains the high point of the excellent ensemble, though at 18, she's threatening to age out of her younger-sister role.

Harriet Beecher Stowe contended that caring for houseplants was a way of girding one's moral fiber, but the plants can gird one's morale as well.

BEHIND THE NEWS The sudden gatherings of people linked through social-networking sites or text messages began benignly but have turned raucous lately, with crowds of youths sprinting down city blocks and sometimes brawling, vandalizing property or assaulting bystanders. ''It was like a tsunami of kids,'' said a deliveryman who was beaten when he tried to keep a rowdy flash mob from invading a pizza shop."

Born in New York City, he was the son of Mary Hand Darrell and John Dwight Winston Churchill, and a grandson of Judge Learned Billings Hand and of the American author, Winston Churchill. After graduating from Harvard College and Harvard Law School and serving in the U.S. Army, he practiced law in the City. He was a member of the Century Association, the American Law Institute, the New York City Bar Association and the Vineyard Haven Yacht Club. He is fondly remembered on Martha's Vineyard and elsewhere as an avid sailor who took great pleasure cruising and racing his 1926 Q boat ""Taygeta"" and the 1979 trimaran ""Moxie"". He navigated ""Moxie's"" record-breaking win (64 hours, 48 minutes) in the 1987 Newport Bermuda Multihull Race. He is survived by his wife, Judith Gaebel Churchill, as well as three step-brothers, Norris Darrell, Jr., Richard W. Darrell and Cass Canfield, Jr. A memorial will be announced at a later date.

WHY IT'S HOT: A young generation of winemakers, restaurateurs and fashion designers, along with British expats and Parisian transplants seeking a slower pace, has given Bordeaux an unstuffy new profile.

2010-03-28T00:00:00Z,"NOAH BAUMBACH'S new movie is called ''Greenberg,'' but it is equally -- maybe even more so -- the story of Florence Marr. Roger Greenberg, the title character, has the more familiar face by far; he's played by Ben Stiller, a big movie star sliding comfortably into a small, sharp movie. But Florence's face is the first one we see. She wanders into the frame pulling a large, slow-moving dog and is then captured in close-up as she negotiates Los Angeles traffic on the way to her job as the household assistant of a well-to-do family with a house in the hills. That face, its soft jaw and wide gray-green eyes topped by untameable dirty-blond hair, is not likely to be recognized by most viewers. Greta Gerwig, the 26-year-old actress, screenwriter and filmmaker who plays Florence, has appeared mainly in the kind of low-key, low-budget, socially networked features that I will try, from this moment forward, not to call mumblecore. ''Greenberg'' is obviously a breakthrough for her -- even if Mr. Baumbach, whose four previous features include ''Kicking and Screaming'' and ''The Squid and the Whale,'' is not exactly Michael Bay -- though not necessarily a departure."
2010-03-28T00:00:00Z,"COMMON wisdom holds that there was a magical time long ago when, whatever your seat assignment, flying was first class. But when did it all end? Last week, Marie Force, the archivist at the Delta Heritage Museum in Atlanta, published an online gallery of photographs of Delta flight attendant uniforms from 1940 to the present. ''Delta was one of the more conservative airlines,'' Ms. Force said. ''We didn't have hot pants.'' Still, for almost 40 straight years, the airline's female flight attendants (something called ''stewardesses'') turned heads with overseas caps (the '40s), stiletto pumps (the '50s), A-line topcoats (the '60s) and bell-bottoms (the '70s). Then, in the '80s, Delta took a style nosedive with doofus sweater vests and horse-bow cravats. The uniform at right, in service from 1950 to 1956, required only an eye patch to transform a Delta attendant into a sexy pulp villainess, like Angelina Jolie in the retro-futurist flop ''Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.'' More period uniforms are at deltamuseum.org. STEPHEN HEYMAN"

2010-03-28T00:00:00Z,"When you own a 150-acre farm, having a change of heart about how you do things is a slow, costly process. When you're a third-generation rice farmer in rural Louisiana -- a state with just 23 organic farms -- deciding to try to grow brown rice without pesticides or chemical fertilizers is enough to get you certified not organic, but insane. Fifteen years ago, Kurt and Karen Unkel of Kinder, La., decided the risk was worth it. ''I started this because I could not see the future in conventional farming,'' Kurt told me when I visited him last month. Back then, he and his brother were farming 2,000 acres. But ''it got to where you could plow 100 acres and you wouldn't find one earthworm.'' As he spoke, he turned over the soil in his experimental vegetable garden, sending earthworms squirming back toward the ground. ''And as I learned about the nutrition, there just wasn't no stopping. You're dealing with life!''"

''As soon as I knew I was going to Zambia, I thought, 'Yeah, I'm definitely bungee jumping.' It was my first time doing it, but, at first, I wasn't scared at all. Even as I stood on the bridge, I was watching other people do it, and still the nerves hadn't hit me. Then, there's a kind of platform you go onto to get harnessed up. And as soon as I stepped on that platform, I was absolutely petrified. Before you jump, it's really beautiful. You've got the falls behind you and you can see the rapids below you and this deep gorge. But when you're actually jumping, it all flies past. I was really worried that there was going to be a massive jerk -- that it would hurt or something -- but I realized I couldn't even feel whether I was going up or down. It all just kind of merged into one.''"

During that time she was an inspiration to all who knew her or came in contact with her. Theresa, known to her children, grandchildren and friends as Tzippi, lived a full and fascinating life. She was married for nearly 50 years to Peter A. Lund, the former CEO of CBS. After meeting in the fifth grade and growing up together in Minneapolis, MN, the two of them, along with their sons, Mark and Tim, began an odyssey that included 13 moves and some wonderful adventures. Tzippi was eclectic in her interests and pursuits. As they moved about the country she was, at various times, a yoga instructor, travel agent, banker, hotel sales agent, photographer and small business entrepreneur. She was an avid hiker and with her good pals she trekked in Nepal, hiked portions of the Appalachian Trail, the mountains of Vermont and Colorado and at one point walked across England. In between trips she was a skier, golfer, tennis player, bridge player and still found time to read two or three books every week. But, clearly her greatest accomplishment was the way she handled the last seven years of her life. From the time she was diagnosed with PSP until she died, she never complained. Even during the past several years, when she couldn't talk or move anything except the fingers of her left hand, she would signal yes when asked if she was happy. A truly remarkable woman who was a gift to the wonderful group of friends who were part of her life until the very end. Theresa is survived by her husband, Peter; her two sons, Mark of NBC in New York and Tim of Arnold Advertising in Boston; and her seven grandchildren, Connor, Kelly, Jack, Maxwell, Olivia, Nathan and Charlotte; and her two sisters, Kathy and Patti. A Mass of Christian Burial will be Celebrated 10am, Monday, March 29, 2010 at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Palm Beach Gardens, FL.

2010-03-28T00:00:00Z,"Starbucks has lately found itself in the middle of a debate between advocates of ''open carry'' gun rights and of gun control; the former have held armed meet-ups at several of its locations, and the latter have demanded that the coffee chain prevent this from happening. Seeking to duck these fresh salvos in the long debate over how firearms fit into American life, the company has issued a statement that such matters ought to be worked out ''in the legislatures and courts, not in our stores.'' Well, sure. But drawing a line between official institutions of lawmaking and the daily sphere where citizens move about is not so easy. And one thing the pistols-and-Frappuccino moment has demonstrated is that this is acutely true for a business with an image carefully devised to blur the line between public space and commercial space. Fans of more-expansive interpretations of the Second Amendment see it as their right to bear arms while going about their routine business, which usually means carrying a concealed weapon. It also turns out that a surprising number of states grant the right to carry an unconcealed weapon. The catch is that private businesses are often allowed to ban guns from their premises, making it difficult, as a practical matter, to run errands while outfitted like Wyatt Earp on the way to the O.K. Corral. Starbucks, as it happens, does not impose such rules in its many thousand square feet of space in states that happen to have open-carry laws. The meet-ups seemed calculated to inspire a showdown, and that's what happened. Peet's and California Pizza Kitchen were also picked as meet-up spots by the open-carry crowd in the San Francisco Bay Area, and these companies responded by promptly instituting no-gun rules. When Starbucks demurred, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence organized an online petition inviting you to ''Tell Starbucks: 'Keep Guns Out.' ''"

It was here that she gathered an extensive body of primary source material which is now located in the Bibliotheque Nationale of France in Paris. Among her many publications which centered on the literary influences on Debussy are The Poetic Debussy, Debussy's Letters to Inghelbrecht, and the co-translation of the Marcel Dietschy biography A Portrait of Claude Debussy. In 2002, she was honored by the French government with the title of Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. At the time of her death she was working on a book on Debussy's letters with quotations from the poetry Jules Laforgue. An avid collector of Debussy letters she donated over 100 to Morgan Library where she was a Fellow.

The Wooster Group, known for collages of high and low culture that make extensive use of technology, has long been housed in and identified with the Performing Garage on Wooster Street in SoHo, though it has occasionally ventured to St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn and elsewhere.

(Many critics loved ''Diva'' at the time, but not all; Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it ''empty though frightfully chic-looking.'')

Graduating from Johns Hopkins University Medical School in 1959, Dr. Kemp finished his Osler internship at Johns Hopkins and then served in the US Air Force in Wiesbaden, Germany, as a medical officer from 1961-63. Returning to the United States, he completed his medical residency at New York Hospital and was chief resident from 1964-65. Following the completion of his studies, Dr. Kemp went to the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston as a fellow, working with Dr. Richard Gorlin until 1970.

Fashioned from vintage Balmain scarves, it possesses qualities close to the heart of the women's fashion director of Barneys New York. ''For one thing, it's not mass-produced,'' Gilhart says. ''Whenever possible, I like to know who a designer is, what they stand for and where their things are made. This is not just 'fashion consciousness' -- it also adds a sense of story, romance and culture to the clothes you buy and wear.'' She refers to Michèle and Olivier Chatenet -- the husband-and-wife team behind E2 -- as futurists. ''They sense what people will want and incorporate it into their collections,'' she says. ''Every piece they make is one of a kind and utilizes pre-existing fabric, but somehow they make it feel new.'' The clothes are also practical for this inveterate traveler. ''The pieces pack easily and are well suited for numerous occasions.'' That's perfect for Gilhart, who is planning a surfing vacation at Nihiwatu Resort on Sumba Island in Indonesia.

2010-03-28T00:00:00Z,"Attention, Chopin fans: On March 1, the 200th anniversary of the Polish composer's birth, a new permanent exhibition opened at the Chopin Muzeum in Warsaw. Designed by the Milan firm Migliore + Servetto Associated Architects, the installation displays some 500 items, from musical manuscripts to the composer's cuff links. In contrast to the setting, the 16th-century Ostrogski Castle, the exhibition design (which won a 2008 competition) is the last word in high tech, offering what the architects called a ''system of emotional landscapes and soundscapes'' that appeals to all the senses. Ico Migliore, a partner in the firm (which won awards for its communication design for the 2006 Olympics in Turin and for an exhibition in Milan for T, among others), explained that each of the thematically organized galleries embodies a different visual and technological approach."

2010-03-28T00:00:00Z,"McGRAW--Harold W.,Jr. The Board of Trustees and Staff of Darien Library mourn the loss of a steadfast and generous supporter, esteemed leader, thoughtful mentor and beloved friend. Harold W. McGraw, Jr. served as Trustee from 1951 to 1957 and 1968 to 1974. He was President of the Library Board from 1953 to 1957 and from 1970 to 1972 and was named an Honorary Trustee in 1977. His leadership of the capital campaign for construction of the first Darien Library in 1957 caused a fellow trustee to remark that Harold McGraw ""almost single handedly got the library built."" In 1972-74 he led the campaign to expand the building by constructing a new children's wing, which was named in honor of the McGraw family. He was Honorary Co-Chairman of the capital campaign that resulted in construction of the New Darien Library, whose opening was celebrated on January 10, 2009, his 91st birthday, with thousands of visitors singing ""Happy Birthday"" to him. Harold seldom visited the new building without stopping by the McGraw Children's Library, named in his honor. His support of the engagement, education and entertainment of children was unwavering; it reflected his commitment to the important role of public libraries from the beginning to the end of the life of each person in the community. To his family, especially Sue, Terry and Robert, we express our sorrow for their loss, tempered only by our belief that his great good kindness, his generosity and his unwavering friendship to so many have set an enduring example of all that is best in human nature. To the memory of Harold W. McGraw, Jr., generous with his support, advice, leadership and, above all, friendship-we pledge that we will never forget the lessons he taught us, and we promise that the Darien Library will always reflect his enduring values of intelligence, common sense, enterprise, commitment and integrity."

There's a burgeoning gallery scene, world-class shopping -- from avant-garde boutiques like IF to big-ticket designers like Marc Jacobs and Dior -- and five-star hotels like the new Four Seasons and Le Gray. ''The Lebanese have a spirit for living for the day, and it permeates every aspect of their life,'' Campbell Gray says. ''You really understand this when you head back to a Western city.''

But he's also known as the cerebral playwright (and star) of sparely staged works like ''The Myopia,'' which the Foundry Theater presented in a critically praised revival this winter. Changing modes so regularly (he's now performing in Michi Barall's ''Rescue Me'' at the Ohio Theater), does he also change his approach? ''I CAN take any empty space and call it a bare stage. A man walks across this empty space whilst someone else is watching him, and that is all that is needed for an act of theater to be engaged.''

2010-03-28T00:00:00Z,"THE calendar says spring has sprung. But inside the typical city apartment, one that lacks skylights and glassy southern exposures and unlimited views of blue sky, spring does not arrive on autopilot. Many New Yorkers must actively invest in spring by adding a few hardy houseplants that can make it anywhere, like a dim walk-up in Hell's Kitchen or a tiny railroad apartment in the Bronx. Harriet Beecher Stowe contended that caring for houseplants was a way of girding one's moral fiber, but the plants can gird one's morale as well. Try a blooming lily (perhaps a clivia) or a mini-cyclamen, which will blossom for months if the room temperature stays below 70 degrees."

''Mas o meu samba transcende,'' he sings -- ''But my samba transcends'' -- just as his band sets up a broodingly buoyant groove. Mr. Veloso, an unimpeachable eminence of Brazilian popular music, must know he isn't straining with that claim. Due out in the United States on Tuesday, ''zii e zie'' features the same younger musicians as on his brittle, embittered rock album ''cê,'' from 2006: the bassist and keyboardist Ricardo Dias Gomes, the drummer Marcelo Callado and the guitarist Pedro Sá, who produced both albums along with Mr. Veloso's oldest son, Moreno Veloso. (On April 8 this same group will begin a brief cross-country tour at Terminal 5 in New York; caetanoveloso.com.br.)"

2010-03-29T15:25:15Z,"""Like many Western governments-like the United States, in fact-Spain has a clear path to recovery provided the economy grows at utterly implausible rates. The secretary of state for the economy now gives presentations to investors in London and Paris professing that Spain is 'determined to act' to reduce its deficit. But this is very much like American noises on the deficit: lots of declarations of will and idealism and very little concrete description of how to get there. Olli Rehn, the monetary commissioner of the European Union, has described the Spanish promise to cut the deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2013 as wishful thinking. Standard & Poor's lowered its rating of the Bank of Spain's debt from Group 2 to Group 3 (which includes the United States) ... The Spanish debt crisis can be looked at in a lot of different ways. You can see the housing bubble, the labor market, the division of governmental labor between Madrid and the autonomous communities, or the lack of political will as the main cause. There are so many budget-cutting measures you may possibly have to take that a good case can be made for shutting down almost any aspect of the welfare state. The whole kit and kaboodle may be nearing the point of unsustainability. The system of state guarantees and welfare rights that Spain has erected may be the biggest bubble of them all. In that case, the wisest course for a politician may be to stay in the boat, hope you are wrong that you are going over the falls, and wait and see what you really have to do to survive."""

Mr. Ryskamp served with extraordinary distinction as Director of the Frick from June 1987 until September 1997, and continued to serve as an advisor until very recently. During his tenure at the Frick, the institution underwent profound evolution. He expanded the special exhibition program, developed new gallery spaces, enhanced the publications program, strengthened the Collection with new art works, and built broader-based support among existing constituencies, while making countless new friends for the Frick. His tireless efforts to stabilize the finances of the Frick Art Reference Library ensured its enduring presence in the world of art history research. His deep knowledge of literature and art informed every aspect of his leadership of the institution, where his commitment to scholarship and connoisseurship remain the touchstones of our mission. Previously seen as a staid and static museum, Mr. Ryskamp found ways to energize the institution without losing sight of its high standards and unique place in the art world. His tireless, ever-engaging, larger-than-life persona drew a widening audience into the Frick circle, and set the course for expanding our outreach to a broader visitorship. He will be remembered for his passionate love of art, for his dedication to ensuring the strength and stability of the institution, as a gifted connoisseur, and for his wisdom, warmth and marvelous wit. He will be deeply missed. Margot C. Bogert, Chair Anne L. Poulet, Director"

Beloved wife of the late Sidney, the love of her life, for 47 years. Cherished mother to Faye, Alice, Michael and James. Adored Grandmother to Lauren, David, Daniel, Benjamin, the late Noah, Jesse and Leigh and ""Super Gaga"" to Eden.

Services will be held at I.J. Morris Boulevard Riverside Chapel, 1895 Flatbush Avenue (Avenue L), Brooklyn, NY (718-633-0400).

2010-03-29T00:00:00Z,"WALSH--Philip C.,died peacefully at his home in Peapack, NJ, on March 24, 2010. Born on May 23rd, 1921, he was the son of Philip C. Walsh and the former Frances Prendergast. He was educated at The Newman School, Phillips Andover Academy and Yale University, where he majored in geology. He graduated in 1944 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and to Sigma XI. He was a First Lieutenant in the 10th Armored Division of George Patton's 3rd Army, served as a Forward Observer in France and in Germany, and was awarded a Purple Heart and a Silver Star for gallantry in action. He married the former Alexandra Somerville Tuck on May 19, 1945, and moved shortly thereafter to Peru in the employ of W.R. Grace & Co. Returning from Peru in 1956, he settled in New Vernon, NJ, though his work would continue to take him to Latin America for the next 40 years. Following his academic interests he left Grace in 1971 to work in the mining industry with Newmont Mining. He would later serve as Vice-Chairman of St. Joe Minerals, Director of Cyprus Minerals Company, and Chairman of the Board of Foote Mineral Company, and was a Corporate Director of T. Rowe Price for twelve years. He was always involved in his community, and served on the Harding Township Board of Education, as the Police Commissioner of Harding Township, as a trustee of Morristown Memorial Hospital, as Chancellor of the American Association of the Order of Malta, and as Commodore of the Edgartown Yacht Club. He was also an active member of the Essex Hunt Club, the Racquet and Tennis Club, and the Somerset Hills Country Club. He was predeceased by his first wife and the mother of his six children in 1993, and was married to the former Peggy McDonnell in 1995. He often commented that he had been blessed to have married two wonderful women. He had an agile and quick mind, loved history, Shakespeare's sonnets, the New York Yankees, the Yale class of '44, Chappaquiddick, hiking in the White Mountains, sailing, writing poetry and, above all, his family. He was a wonderful guy, a friend to all, and was as good a father and husband as God created. We will miss him terribly. He leaves six children (Eugenie Flaherty of Philadelphia, PA, Philip of Miami, FL, Frances Cummings of Bedford, NY, Alec of Basking Ridge, NJ, Nicholas of Yarmouth, ME, and Elizabeth Lovering of Bedford, NY), eight step-children (Pia Pearce of Norwich, VT, Michael of Malibu, CA, Megan Kyle of Freeport, ME, Stephen of Pipersville, PA, Peggy Vance of New York City, Anna of Los Angeles, CA, Terry of Norwich, VT, and Andrew of Old Chatham, NY), 19 grandchildren, 27 step-grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Born in London on November 3rd, 1934, he was painfully separated from his mother in the early years of World War II as a child evacuee. When his mother was able to locate him at the end of the war, they moved to Calgary, Alberta and eventually settled in Providence, Rhode Island. A committed and stellar student, Michael graduated Magna Cum Laude from Providence College and was admitted to Harvard Business School where he was honored as a Baker Scholar. He then moved to New York City to begin a career as an Investment Banker at Shearson Lehman, eventually branching out on his own to concentrate on the development of small businesses. Among his many accomplishments were the launch and eventual sale of Essence Magazine and board seats at such companies as SFN Group and Pueblo International. He considered himself a true New Yorker, a lover of the arts, particularly the opera.

In 1961 he was featured in Life Magazine for his work with children who stutter. In 1962 he became director of the National Hospital for Speech Disorders in New York City. His accomplishments included many periodicals determining that stuttering was an emotional, not physical disorder. He continued his practice as a Clinical Psychologist in New York until his retirement to Vermont in 1988. Murry painted prolifically for over forty years of his life, even after macular degeneration deprived him of his sight. Many of his works feature the profound beauty that he always loved about Vermont. Survivors include his wife, Helen Snyder of Middlebury, his daughter Karen Snyder Kadish of Norwood, New Jersey and his two sons, Adam Snyder of Homewood, Alabama and Andy Snyder of Florence, Vermont, two daughters-in-law, Sue Buckingham and Christine Anderson. Murry was very close to his two grandchildren, Ethan Anderson Snyder and Caleb Snyder-Kadish. He was pre-deceased by his eldest son, David in 2002.

Her father, Dr. Leon Wulman, was a physician and director of the OSE, a Jewish relief organization. In New York she met and married Fred Jacobson, chief of the German desk of the Voice of America and a lyricist. The family moved to Germany in 1963, where Fred, still with the VOA, became a successful song writer, in German and English, under the name Fred Jay. Muszka was instrumental in her husband's career, in ways large and small. She was an exquisite hostess of parties in Berlin and New York and of countless guests at their house in Tuscany. Passionately devoted to friends and family, she had a knack for helping people and an instinct for novel solutions to life's problems. She was a wonderful teller of stories and anecdotes. After Fred's death in 1988, she established a yearly award in his name, the Fred Jay Prize, for German language song lyricists. Apart from promoting careers, this 15,000 Euro award became a major bash for the German music business, a party which bore the imprint of her personality. During these later years, she divided her time between Munich, Tuscany and New York, where her son, Dr. Michael Jacobson, daughter-in-law, Dr. Elizabeth Jacobson and beloved granddaughter, Annie live. They survive her and will miss her greatly, but feel she lives on in her friendships, in the memories of her friends and in her stories. Michael, Elizabeth and Anna Jacobson"

He was educated at The Newman School, Phillips Andover Academy and Yale University, where he majored in geology. He graduated in 1944 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and to Sigma XI. He was a First Lieutenant in the 10th Armored Division of George Patton's 3rd Army, served as a Forward Observer in France and in Germany, and was awarded a Purple Heart and a Silver Star for gallantry in action. He married the former Alexandra Somerville Tuck on May 19, 1945, and moved shortly thereafter to Peru in the employ of W.R. Grace & Co. Returning from Peru in 1956, he settled in New Vernon, NJ, though his work would continue to take him to Latin America for the next 40 years. Following his academic interests he left Grace in 1971 to work in the mining industry with Newmont Mining. He would later serve as Vice-Chairman of St. Joe Minerals, Director of Cyprus Minerals Company, and Chairman of the Board of Foote Mineral Company, and was a Corporate Director of T. Rowe Price for twelve years. He was always involved in his community, and served on the Harding Township Board of Education, as the Police Commissioner of Harding Township, as a trustee of Morristown Memorial Hospital, as Chancellor of the American Association of the Order of Malta, and as Commodore of the Edgartown Yacht Club. He was also an active member of the Essex Hunt Club, the Racquet and Tennis Club, and the Somerset Hills Country Club. He was predeceased by his first wife and the mother of his six children in 1993, and was married to the former Peggy McDonnell in 1995. He often commented that he had been blessed to have married two wonderful women. He had an agile and quick mind, loved history, Shakespeare's sonnets, the New York Yankees, the Yale class of '44, Chappaquiddick, hiking in the White Mountains, sailing, writing poetry and, above all, his family. He was a wonderful guy, a friend to all, and was as good a father and husband as God created. We will miss him terribly. He leaves six children (Eugenie Flaherty of Philadelphia, PA, Philip of Miami, FL, Frances Cummings of Bedford, NY, Alec of Basking Ridge, NJ, Nicholas of Yarmouth, ME, and Elizabeth Lovering of Bedford, NY), eight step-children (Pia Pearce of Norwich, VT, Michael of Malibu, CA, Megan Kyle of Freeport, ME, Stephen of Pipersville, PA, Peggy Vance of New York City, Anna of Los Angeles, CA, Terry of Norwich, VT, and Andrew of Old Chatham, NY), 19 grandchildren, 27 step-grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

2010-03-30T00:00:00Z,"The dramatic passage of health care reform was a historic turning point in the effort to repair a deeply broken system. But by itself, the legislation will not be enough to address the needs of many people of color, who face higher rates of infant mortality, chronic disease and disability, and premature death than white Americans do. The new law will help expand insurance coverage and improve access to health care providers in underserved communities, among other benefits. But the major reasons for the persistence of racial and ethnic health inequalities are socioeconomic inequality and differences in neighborhood living conditions -- both of them fueled by residential segregation. These are the issues that policymakers must tackle if we are to improve opportunities for good health for all."

Where a subject like this is concerned, no statistical assessment is going to be completely dispositive, but I am persuaded that the John Jay/N.R.B. portrait of the pattern of abuse - the rise from the late '50s till 1980, and the drop-off since - is as rigorous as one can hope for at the moment. (In addition, the National Review Board report does an impressive job of addressing many of the cultural issues related to the crisis in an evenhanded and non-hysterical way.)"

Alejandro Alcocer, a watch fanatic and design entrepreneur who has previously delved into skateboarding, catering and handbag design, followed the legend of a black watch supposedly released by Rolex in the late 1960s for the Royal British Army soldiers stationed in South Africa. It was thought that only 500 were made, but Rolex never confirmed their distribution and they became the holy grail of watch collecting. So Alcocer decided to make his own, with the help of a Pennsylvania-based company that had previously done contract work for the U.S. Army but had fallen on tough times. Aside from the dial and crystal, which remain in vintage original condition, the watches were transformed into matte black beauties using highly specialized chemical applications. Black is the new black, and I'm feeling for the Rolex redux."

That's not just because glasses are expensive, but also because in Mexico they're often perceived as evidence of a handicap. In an attempt to address both problems, Ver Bien turned to the industrial designer Yves Béhar, who, as the creator of the One Laptop Per Child XO (the original $100 computer), has earned a reputation as a maker of inexpensive, attractive products for kids in the developing world. Béhar designed a set of split frames, which makes the glasses less costly to assemble in the field and lets kids customize them using a smorgasbord of color options. ''They're at the intersection of practicality and personal expression,'' Béhar says. With the help of Augen, the manufacturer, Ver Bien can keep the total cost - including an eye exam and shipping - at just $10. This year alone, it will give away 400,000 pairs. ''This is about using the very best not to make the most expensive product,'' Béhar says, ''but to make the most valuable product - and to make it efficiently.''"

Walker, the chief United States district judge of San Francisco, ruled that federal agents had eavesdropped illegally on an Islamic charity based in the United States. Judge Walker said that the Bush administration lacked the authority to act without warrants to intercept phone calls and e-mail messages between Americans and foreigners as part of an effort to prevent terrorist attacks. The ruling delivered a blow to the Bush administration's claims that its surveillance program, which Mr. Bush authorized shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was lawful. The intercepts, Judge Walker ruled, violated a 1978 federal statute requiring court approval for domestic surveillance. The organization monitored by the taps, in this case, was Al Haramain, a now-defunct Islamic charity in Oregon. Two lawyers representing it in 2004 were also tapped. The judge said the plaintiffs had been ""subjected to unlawful surveillance,"" and said the government was liable to pay them damages. [The New York Times, The San Francisco Chronicle]"

A lifelong collector of one-of-a-kind bikes from around the world, Maharam, of the New York textile company of the same name, recently made friends with a true expert - Sacha White, a master builder who owns Vanilla Bicycles in Portland, Ore. Together, they conceived an exhibition devoted to the work of craftsmen like White, who make a living cutting steel, welding and filing for weeks on end. (''You wouldn't want to be their manicurist,'' Maharam says.) The show, ''Bespoke: The Handbuilt Bicycle,'' which opens May 12 at the Museum of Arts and Design, collects 21 of the finest contemporary examples from America and abroad, from charming, Old World road bikes to aggressively styled titanium and steel mountain bikes. On the gallery's back wall, a set of drawings by the design firm 2x4 explains how bicycles are built. Maharam hopes the exhibition will open up the city's bicycle culture to more people. ''One reason bicycles have become so popular is because manufacturers are making the well designed and beautiful accessible to the masses,'' he says. ''This is the epitome of the well designed and beautiful.''"

Marty was a devoted and supportive husband and a kind and attentive father and grandfather who dedicated his life to our happiness. Despite a long and painful illness, he remained cheerful and true to his sweet spirit to the end. Marty was a graduate of Far Rockaway High School, the SUNY Maritime College and Brooklyn Law School. His public service included positions as an Assistant Attorney General of the State of New York, a Councilman of the Town of Hempstead, Long Island, and a director of the Long Island Power Authority. He was a successful real estate developer and investor, and long before recycling became a household word, he founded Ponderosa Fibres of America, once the largest producer of recycled pulp in the world. He went on to finance various ventures and served as a director on numerous educational and private boards, and worked tirelessly to give senior citizens in New York City better, safer lives. Marty's interests ranged from Saturday afternoons at the opera to following the exploits of Jack Bauer in ""24"". He was an avid bibliophile whose curiosity ranged from serious studies of World War II and the Civil War, to the big, contemporary novels of Philip Roth. He is also one of the few who read all twenty of Patrick O'Brien's AubreyMaturin books; still, he found time to read three newspapers a day as well as ""The New Yorker"" every week. He loved a round of golf and a game of poker with his buddies, and watching the New York Jets with his boys. Marty was the kindest, most compassionate, and generous of men who enjoyed numerous lifetime friendships. He sought to help anyone in need, and always had a good story or joke to share with friends and family. His goodness and love will be with us forever. Marty is survived by his wife of 26 years, Deborah, his sons Scott Bernstein, Nathan Bernstein and Paul Meyer, daughters Lori Chaiken and Michelle Salem, and their spouses, Bonnie Bernstein, Helen Bernstein, Janine Meyer and Steve Chaiken. He proudly leaves behind ten adored grandchildren: Mathew and Alyssa Bernstein, Rachel and Samantha Bernstein, Tucker, Karli, Hana Grace and Joseph Meyer, Jack and Katie Chaiken, and his beloved dog, Rufus."

2010-04-02T13:00:31Z,"Lately, buns - sometimes holy - have been on everyone's minds, bodies and menus. As a nod to Good Friday, with apologies to anyone who's off leavened items this week, here's a guide to the Big Apple's best buns: sticky, cinnamon, hot cross and otherwise:STICKY BUNSLet's start at the very beginning with a small bakery on Madison Avenue at 83rd Street, William Greenberg Jr. Desserts. When I was a child, my father went here for schnecken. The German word for snail, its reference is the spiral shape of the thing. In fact, while I identify schnecken with this particular rich-doughed, cinnamon-filled, raisin-laden, pecan-topped, caramelized breakfast staple, the label is as generic as ""danish,"" and can be used to describe any flattened, coiled, cinnamon-raisin pastry. Sadly, William Jr. sold his bakery a number of years ago and the goods don't taste the same. If you want to experience a sticky bun as I knew it, you can go two blocks down to E.A.T., where Eli Zabar has created something that rivals the Greenberg classic. Or else call Scarsdale, where William's son Seth continues to bake (and sell) his father's schnecken. Seth uses the same ingredients as his dad and has the original 1930s recipe cards to prove it. You can taste the sour cream and butter in the dough; the perfectly burnt brown sugar in the thick glaze."

Some of his ballets remain controversial for their style, which could include aspects of exaggerated and repetitious expressionism, sexual imagery in nonsexual contexts, acrobatic hyperextension, over-manipulative partnering and jerkily mechanical pure-dance routines. And almost every ballet he ever made remains controversial for its deficiencies of construction: individual dances are too long or too irrelevant, certain scenes are expressively unclear, overall organization has too many loose ends."

There he found an archive of flat files, filled with the stuff of a designer's dreams: pencil sketches on graph paper by Josef Hoffmann, graceful charcoal drawings of glassware by Oswald Haerdtl and renderings of complicated patterns and engraved borders by Adolf Loos. These rich supporting materials by Vienna's early-20th-century masters will be on view at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, alongside their delicate three-dimensional counterparts, beginning April 23 as part of ''Ted Muehling Selects: Lobmeyr Glass From the Permanent Collection.'' From a baroque, leaf-cut decanter by Ludwig Lobmeyr to the thin, attenuated muslin glass forms that have dominated the past half century, Muehling primarily chose pieces meant for celebration and ritual; the great thing about Lobmeyr, he says, is ''they may be opulent and insanely expensive, but for the most part the pieces are useful and functional drinking glasses.''"

2010-04-02T09:47:40Z,Here are some highlights from Friday's edition of The New York Times:
2010-04-02T09:30:46Z,"Say hello to ""The Losers,"" at No. 10 on our paperback list. That series, written by Andy Diggle and illustrated by Jock (no last name -- think Madonna), is about members of a  special forces group who are betrayed by their handler and find themselves hunted by the C.I.A. The series ran 32 issues, from 2003 to 2006, but the run was long enough to garner interest from Hollywood. A film version of the comic is to open on April 23. Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoë Saldana and Chris Evans are part of the elite team, while Jason Patric plays their renegade handler, Max. ""The Losers"" are a reinvention of a group of DC Comics characters from the 1960s who had many adventures in World War II."
2010-04-02T09:30:25Z,"Even in 3-D, Alice in Wonderland has nothing on the Surrealists, who imagined spaces far trippier than any rabbit hole. Max Ernst drew a maiden trapped inside a giant zoetrope; Alberto Giacometti created rooms strung with a spinal column and other oddities; and Salvador Dalí's famous ''Dream of Venus'' installation, at the 1939 World's Fair, was an aquatic funhouse filled with topless women and a rubber cow udder. For the exhibition ''The Surreal House,'' which opens June 10 at London's Barbican gallery, the curators have worked with the architects Carmody Groarke to bring these dreamscapes to life, constructing a labyrinth of rooms and corridors that immerse visitors in the art, films and furnishings of the movement's original and contemporary practitioners. ''The idea is to radically alter the space so that you're not sure what's up, what's down or where it finishes,'' says Alona Pardo, an assistant curator at the Barbican. Rather than imagining surreal interiors, the sculptors Claude and François-Xavier Lalanne furnished them. Their zoologically inspired pieces are now on view at the Les Arts Décoratifs in Paris, including hippo-shaped bathtubs and a bed that resembles a can of sardines. The retrospective also includes pieces designed for Yves Saint Laurent's apartment, exhibited here for the first time."

As ubiquitous as cellphone towers - and as grimly utilitarian - the lamps are a not so subtle reminder that even L.A. is prone to the change of seasons. Sort of, anyway. Kindle Living aims to give the heat lamp an image makeover by reimagining it as an actual lamp. The three models currently in production come complete with pleated shades, curvaceous bases (to hide unsightly propane tanks) and an array of colors, like black - perfect for that post-Oscar bash - or pale pink for a poolside sweet 16. And true to form, the Kindle Glow, with its translucent shell, offers not just warmth but mood lighting. Now if only it provided cellphone reception."

2010-04-02T00:00:00Z,"DANCIS--Joseph, M.D. The Board of Trustees, faculty, and staff of NYU Langone Medical Center mourn the sudden passing of Joseph Dancis, M.D. Dr. Joseph Dancis, former Chairman of the Department of Pediatrics, joined the faculty at NYU following his postdoctoral work. He was promoted to professor in 1962 and appointed Chair of the Department of Pediatrics in 1974, a position he held until 1989. His vision for the future of pediatrics, commitment to research, and his mentorship of a generation of pediatricians has had an indelible effect on the character of the School of Medicine's Department of Pediatrics and the field of pediatrics. In his honor, the department's annual Dancis Day is dedicated to presentation of resident, fellow and young faculty research. As a nationally recognized expert, Dr. Dancis' influence has been felt far beyond the School of Medicine. He wrote scores of peer-review papers, was an expert on inherited metabolic diseases and the physiology of the placenta. In all his roles, he thought like a scientist, deliberate and purposeful. In 1983, he was elected President of the American Pediatric Society and subsequently, in 1986, received its most prestigious award, the Howland Award, recognizing a career of accomplishment in academic pediatrics. His prodigious works in the field of inborn errors of metabolism are broadly referenced to this day in the medical literature. Dr. Dancis received a bachelor's degree from Columbia College in 1934 and graduated from St. Louis University School of Medicine in 1938. He completed residency training at Bellevue Hospital and subsequently pursued research training in protein and nucleic acid chemistry at NYU and Sloane-Kettering. A colleague and generous supporter of the Department of Pediatrics, Dr. Dancis will be deeply missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his daughter Dale Dancis, of New York City and his son, Dr. Andrew Dancis of Philadelphia, and three grandchildren. Kenneth G.

Dr. Dancis wrote scores of peer-reviewed papers and was elected president of the American Pediatric Society in 1983. In 1986, he received the Society's most prestigious award, the Howland Award, recognizing a career of accomplishment in academic pediatrics. His prodigious works in the field of inborn errors of metabolism are broadly referenced to this day in the medical literature. A Brooklyn native, Dr. Dancis entered Columbia University at the age of 15 and then attended the St. Louis School of Medicine where he graduated at the age of 22 as a member of Alpha Omega Alpha, the medical honor society. He became a medical investigator at a time when the tools for this activity were just being developed. His research was eclectic, touching on varied topics and delving into the biochemistry of a patient problem. In each of his various research areas, pursued over many years, he interacted closely with patients, patients' families, and a broad array of close collaborators and colleagues. His research and work developed answers that helped define the metabolic pathways underlying human disease. A loving husband, father and grandfather, Joseph Dancis will be deeply missed."

We were fortunate enough to stay once with Lindiwe's family, all 30 or so of them. Four generations live in a few round houses on top of a hill, including Lindiwe, her father and his multiple wives. The next morning, a few of the grandchildren including Ntumfa (in white) and Hippo (in orange) took us on a hike. Suddenly, we were in the midst of rolling hills covered in tall, pale grass.

A product of the New York City school system who graduated first in his class at NYU, and obtained his law degree from Yale, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Quarterly, Mr. Bierman began his career with the chief counsel's office of the IRS in Washington. While there, in the legislation and regulations division, he worked on many critical projects, including the excess profits tax regulations, which helped pay for WWII. In 1947, Mr. Bierman left the chief counsel's office for private practice. He became a partner in both the national accounting firm of J.K. Lasser & Co. and its legal advisor, the law firm of Chase & Bierman.He loved the arts and literature and represented many arts-oriented organizations and individual artists. He later became Of Counsel to Schwartz, Burns, Lesser & Jacoby, which in turn represented MCA and Universal, among others. Mr. Bierman also personally represented certain artists and organizations such as Simon & Schuster and the controversial science fiction writer, L. Ron Hubbard, during Hubbard's development of Dianetics. During Mr. Bierman's career, he was a prodigious writer and lecturer. Among many other works, he co-authored ""Income Tax Differentials"" with William J. Casey, former director of the CIA. He taught at the NYU Law School and was instrumental in developing the NYU master of laws program in taxation. He was a major force and frequent chairman at the NYU Practising Law Institute, NYU's continuing legal education program for tax lawyers. Mr. Bierman also founded the Hawaii Tax Institute. While still in New York, he served Of Counsel to London, Buttenweiser & Chalif, and to Helen Lehman Buttenweiser's and Ephraim London's successor firm, London Buttenweiser. He was undoubtedly one of the pre-eminent tax lawyers of his day. In 1977, at age 62, he moved to Florida, and began a second career. He became a professor at the University of Miami School of Law, where then Dean Soia Mentschikoff appointed him director of the graduate law program in taxation. At age 67, the IRS asked Mr. Bierman to return as professor-in-residence to spend a year studying and making recommendations with respect to the ""Underground Economy."" In this capacity, he analyzed and helped draft numerous regulations. Returning to Miami at age 77, Mr. Bierman began his third career by enrolling as a student at the University of Miami and earning a master's degree in mental health counseling. At age 81, as a mental health counselor, he spent a number of years counseling troubled youths in Miami's Liberty City. Until he was 90, he guided a large number of young people into useful and productive lives. Mr. Bierman was a religious man and a major philanthropic force in the Miami Beach Jewish community. Among the many beneficiaries of his philanthropic efforts were the Talmudic University, the Ascent Institute, and a Jewish women's homeless shelter. The endowed chair in taxation at Yale Law School bears his name. Mr. Bierman was an avid bongo player, art collector, reader, skier, painter, and collector of early American pressed glass goblets. He loved science fiction, owned a cattle ranch, enjoyed fishing, and was a wine connoisseur. As a tax lawyer, as a professor of taxation, and as a social worker, he achieved lasting success and changed lives. He will be deeply missed by many. Mr. Bierman is survived by his wife Gloria and their four children, Adam, Joshua, Douglas, and Robin Tennant. He is also survived by his first wife Irma and their three children, Alfred, Michael, and Louise Oshatz. In addition, he is survived by seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren."

Penny Martin, the editor of The Gentlewoman, a new twice-a-year style guide and sister publication to Fantastic Man, thinks otherwise. ''The best magazines have always come out of a recession,'' she said. ''The Face, i-D, Blitz -- they all launched in 1980, after the winter of discontent. Strangely enough, this doesn't feel odd at all.'' Of course, it helps that The Gentlewoman, a stylish, thinking gal's read infused with a certain retro charm, is unlike any other women's magazine out there.

2010-04-04T00:00:00Z,"EDWARDS--Manho Chou, 75, died February 18, in Washington, DC. Born April 4, 1934 in Hangzhou, China. Eldest of six children of a Chinese air force officer and regional magistrate serving in the Kuomintang government under Chiang Kai-shek. During the war with Japan, her family lived in Yunnan, Chungching, and Chengdu. Her private memoirs describe the severity of Japanese bombings in the countryside. She and her siblings would blow out candles and hide under beds when the bombs fell. She recalled American relief planes dropping packages of Klim powdered milk, Gerber's cookies and small black scissors. She kept a pair as a memento. Her family had prominent members including her uncle, the major poet Zhu Ziqing. As her family fled the Communists in 1949, Mao Zedung praised her uncle in a famous anti-imperialist speech titled ""Farewell, Leighton Stuart,"" referring to the last US envoy. Another maternal uncle was Zhu Wuhua, China's first Harvard Ph.D. in physics and president of Shanghai Jiaotong University. Her family resettled in Taiwan, where she met Robert Randle Edwards, a young US Navy officer from Alabama who had studied Mandarin. When they wed, her husband was threatened with discharge for marrying ""an aborigine."" In 1961 they moved to Massachusetts and then New York, where her husband was a law professor at Columbia University. She received a BA from Columbia in 1981. A person of many talents, she enjoyed music, cooking and writing. She suffered from surgery-induced hypoparathyroidism and was an advocate for fellow victims. Survivors include her husband and three children, Lee, Sue, and Jon."

The Yankees, the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Angels have lots of money, deep reservoirs of homegrown talent and passionate fans who seem to scrape up every ticket every night. It is no coincidence that those teams have each made four playoff appearances in the last five seasons. The Oakland Athletics won the American League West in 2006, the same year the Detroit Tigers won the wild card. The Tampa Bay Rays won the East in 2008. Otherwise, the West division has been property of the Angels, and the wild card and East division have gone to the Yankees or the Red Sox."

2010-04-04T00:00:00Z,"AS a 26-year-old woman living in Manhattan, I have zero tolerance for couples who exhibit very private affections in very public places. Although I try to look elsewhere, these amorous displays are hard to avoid. Everywhere I go, people are fondling each other as if the entire city were a cheap motel room. At a restaurant on the Lower East Side recently I was enjoying a friend's company when the man and woman next to us joined hands across the table. If it had stopped there, we could have just rolled our eyes and continued our conversation. Instead, they leaned in for a lengthy, passionate kiss that lifted them off their chairs. We skipped dessert and decided to cap off the meal at a nearby coffee shop -- only to watch another couple sit side by side in a lip lock while we sipped lattes."

2010-04-04T00:00:00Z,"ART comes in many forms. For the West Coast artist Alex Israel, it's sunglasses. Freeway Eyewear is Mr. Israel's latest project, and, as with all of his work, it is inspired by Los Angeles. ''I was at an existential point in my career where I didn't know what to make,'' he said of the line's genesis. ''Sunglasses just stood out as a symbol of Southern California.'' Five of the styles are named after L.A. freeways (a sixth, called L.A. Rays, is a revival of a once-defunct brand); each takes a design cue from classic frames: The 15 is based on surfer shades from the 1950s; the 10 (above) is a nod to the '90s Wayfarer. To further boost the brand's SoCal vibe, Mr. Israel enlisted the graphic designer John Van Hamersveld, best known for his Day-Glo ''Endless Summer'' film poster, to create the logo, and the photographer Anthony Friedkin, who has been documenting Los Angeles since the '70s, to shoot the retro-beachy campaign (right)."

What are your recommendations about the frequency and amount of watering indoor plants? William R. Bauer A. The only foolproof method of proper watering is the finger test. Insert a finger an inch or two into the soil. If it's moist, do nothing. If it's damp and a tropical, water it. If it's a succulent, wait until it's completely dry. When watering, water thoroughly.

But the question also arises, which is more environmentally friendly: an e-reader or an old-fashioned book? To find the answer, we turned to life-cycle assessment, which evaluates the ecological impact of any product, at every stage of its existence, from the first tree cut down for paper to the day that hardcover decomposes in the dump. With this method, we can determine the greenest way to read."

He was tenacious, hard-working, discerning, fearless, pioneering, modest, athletic, handsome, and a great adventurer. His seminal work in the field of drug addiction and treatment in the late 60's helped to transform our understanding of substance abuse from a moral affliction into the modern concept of a treatable disease. As a professor at the University of Chicago, he went into the Chicago ghetto to understand heroine addiction and discovered ""copping areas."" He won the trust of radical groups, such as the Black Panthers, which helped him gain a revolutionary perspective within his field. His findings were published in his book ""Behind the Wall of Respect."" He then went on to the international stage, traveling to Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Iran, India, Burma and more in an effort to understand and develop effective treatment strategies for the varied drug problems around the world in his role as Principal Investigator for the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland. He finished out his career with 20 years of clinical service at the Tampa Bay Pines V.A. During this period, he also led important research at the University of South Florida looking at physician drug abuse. His accomplishments were not limited to his career. A self-taught sailor on the stormy seas of Lake Michigan during his Chicago years, he took a break from research after WHO and lived on his Formosa 41 sailboat in the Mediterranean Sea for four years, braving the vicious Mistral storms and ultimately sailing across the Atlantic Ocean back to the States, navigating by the stars with an old-fashioned sextant and encountering a storm so powerful it broke the boom. Medical Degree, University of Pittsburgh (second in class); Medical Internship, Stanford University; Psychiatric Residency, Columbia University; Masters in Public Health, Columbia University. Featured doctor in People Magazine, May 1978. He is survived by a daughter, Kristina, and four siblings Richard Hughes, Rosemary Slate, Kevin Hughes and Kathy Molina. He was preceded in death by his parents Michael F. and Sarah Frances Hughes. The family held a private service.

''Obsessive Consumption'' (Princeton Architectural Press) is her sweet act of contrition.

2010-04-06T17:19:11Z,"Today's priestly sex abuse story features a South Asian cleric accused of assaulting a teenage girl (and robbing his diocese into the bargain) while serving temporarily in Minnesota. He had already returned to India by the time the allegations surfaced, at which point the Minnesotan bishop wrote to the Vatican suggesting that the priest might need to be removed from ministry. The priest's bishop in India, however, ordered him to undertake a year of prayer in a monastery, rather than seeking to have him defrocked, even as further accusations surfaced in Minnesota, and the county attorney began pursuing extradition. A Vatican spokesman says that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith recommended laicization, but (per canon law) deferred to the Indian bishop on the matter. However, the documents suggest that at least initially, the C.D.F. only recommended that the priest be monitored and kept away from minors."

You can only do one thing at a time on the iPad, and while I'm well aware that e-mail and LOLcats and all kinds of social networking treats are not much further away than a few extra clicks, switching from one app to another feels so definitive - qualitatively different from having multiple windows open on a single screen ... We are often urged to frown on devices that don't prompt us to collaborate on and create - or at the very least comment on - all the amazing old and new things, from news reports to scientific studies, Web comics to video mash-ups, that proliferate online.

2010-04-06T12:35:22Z,"As far as symbols of '80s excess go, it's hard to beat Cindy Crawford (she of big hair and voluptuous - by model standards, anyway - body) and MCM (Mode Creation Munich), the Euro leather goods brand, whose flashy logoed caramel-colored bags gave even Gucci and Louis Vuitton a run for their money. (Did we mention this was the '80s?) The MCM ads were equally flashy, featuring Crawford perched on a pile of suitcases or posing wearing nothing except a giant MCM logo. (If that weren't enough, they were signed ""I want my MCM"" and ""The beginning of a beautiful friendship."" Awwww.) And while you might think that such naked consumption went the way of the world economy, you would think wrong. Not only has the brand been on a store opening spree with 15 new Saks Fifth Avenue boutiques and a Beverly Hills Rodeo Drive boutique scheduled for later this year, but it has signed on as a sponsor for New York fashion week. MCM is even recreating its Cindy Crawford campaign, this time around with the model Coco Rocha. Under the circumstances, the images are a bit more modest - Rocha's mane is tamed down, and she's wearing a bustier dress - but the message is not lost."

The number of Americans who believe in the literal resurrection of Jesus Christ has dropped 10 points in the last decade; only 26 percent of Christians believe that they will have bodies in the next life; and almost a third of Americans (including one in five self-identified Christians) now believe in reincarnation. Pondering these trends, Miller argues that some kind of immortality of the soul is simply ""easier to swallow"" than a physical resurrection; the latter, she suggests, presents all sorts of ""credibility problems"" that the ""more reasonable"" belief in purely spiritual afterlife lacks."

Not Exactly | As residents on both sides of the Mexican border cleaned up after Sunday's earthquake, the authorities warned that many Californians remained unprepared for a serious quake, and emergency officials said that budget cuts have strained their ability to handle a disaster. The budget challenges faced by firefighters and other first responders have probably affected preparedness, fire officials say, particularly in remote or lightly populated areas that often depend on larger cities or agencies for help in emergencies. Sunday's quake registered 7.2 and centered in a largely unpopulated area of northern Mexico. But a recent study by the California Emergency Management Agency found a majority of the state's households failing to meet recommendations for many basic emergency needs, like stockpiling water (a minimum of three gallons per person), reinforcing their homes and making disaster plans. ""We know that there's going to be an earthquake, and we know it's going to be a major natural disaster,"" said Lou Paulson, president of the California Professional Firefighters and a captain in the Contra Costa County fire protection district.

But a surprising new study finds that mothers and fathers alike are doing a better job than they think, spending far more time with their families than did parents of earlier generations. The study, by two economists at the University of California, San Diego, analyzes a dozen surveys of how Americans say they use their time, taken at different periods from 1965 to 2007. It reports that the amount of child care time spent by parents at all income levels - and especially those with a college education - has risen ''dramatically'' since the mid-1990s. (The findings by the husband-and-wife economist team of Garey Ramey and Valerie A. Ramey appear in a discussion paper presented in March at a Brookings Institution conference in Washington.)"

2010-04-07T00:00:00Z,"In the rush this January to finish New York State's application in a competition for federal education grants, much of the spotlight fell on the Legislature, as lawmakers wrangled over a bill that would increase the number of charter schools permitted in the state. New York did not win the first round of the competition, called Race to the Top, but the failure to increase the number of charter schools was not the only reason. A close review of the state's application, and of the judges' comments, reveals a number of ill-fated moves."

Not long after, the Dalai Lama instructed Tenzin Zopa, a disciple of Konchog since the age of 7, to search for his reincarnation in the form of a young boy. For four years Mr. Zopa -- traveling the high country by foot, mule and helicopter, and guided by astrology, dreams and the direction of the smoke from the pyre at Lama Konchog's cremation -- looked for small children with special characteristics and performed ritualistic tests. He then made his determination, above, and awaited the Dalai Lama's decision. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said that this documentary from Nati Baratz ''inevitably leads you to consider the material world and to contemplate the balance in your own life between physical gratification and spirituality.'' He continued: ''The rugged landscape, in which mist filters through craggy cliffs, and wild flowers seem to dance in the mountain meadows, suggests that religion and geography are profoundly intertwined.''

''The Russians invaded us before and they are invading us again,'' Ms. Balounova, 50, said from her art gallery in this picturesque spa town, where Peter the Great first came for a treatment in 1711 and which has since become so popular with Russians that most signs offering luxury products and services -- from million-euro villas to colonic irrigation -- are in Russian.

On July 13 and 14, Sting, the Police man and solo pop star, will perform at the Met with the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra of London, it was announced on Wednesday. While Sting said, in a telephone interview, that he was ''stoked'' for the full orchestra tour, which begins June 2 in Vancouver, British Columbia, his dates at the Met have him feeling ''both excited and anxious.'' ''I think one needs to take this seriously,'' Sting said. ''It's quite something to be sitting in front of the Royal Philharmonic on the Met stage. I think I'm suitably anxious.''

Mark Rozzo peeks into the new trend in design-magazine photography - capturing the less-than-perfect reality of the way we really live - while Christopher Petkanas looks back at Ruby Ross Wood, a great decorator of the 20th century, who never had a hair out of place, design-wise. Jerusalem reveals its burgeoning design scene, and we get to know the gallerist and cultural multitasker Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn. See all stories »"

2010-04-10T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (Starz) JULIE & JULIA (2009) Meryl Streep, right, plays the chef Julia Child in yet another of her Oscar-nominated performances. Amy Adams is Julie Powell, an unhappy cubicle worker who tries to salvage her life by working her way through Child's ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking'' in a year and blogging about it. Nora Ephron wrote and directed this film, which is based on two memoirs: ''My Life in France'' by Child and Alex Prud'homme, and ''Julie & Julia'' by Ms. Powell. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said of Ms. Streep: ''By now this actress has exhausted every superlative that exists and to suggest that she has outdone herself is only to say that she's done it again. Her performance goes beyond physical imitation, though she has the rounded shoulders and the fluting voice down perfectly.'' Instead of overshadowing the original, she added, ''Ms. Streep's incarnation of Julia Child has the opposite effect, making the real Julia, who died in 2004, more vivid, more alive, than ever.'' And though Ms. Adams may have been outmatched by Ms. Streep, Ms. Dargis called Stanley Tucci, as Child's husband, Paul, impeccable. 10:30 A.M.

2010-04-10T00:00:00Z,"A federal judge on Friday rejected a bid by Barclays to throw out a motion by Lehman Brothers Holdings to recover an $11 billion ''windfall'' the bank supposedly made on the purchase of the bankrupt firm's North American brokerage. The case pits creditors and customers of Lehman, which an examiner said used accounting methods that concealed billions of dollars of risks, against Britain's second-biggest bank. Barclays doubled its profit last year and reported a $4 billion gain on the brokerage in 2008. Judge James Peck of United States District Court in New York threw out Barclays' request at the outset of a court hearing, instead ordering immediate opening statements in the case. ''The court was never told of the $11 billion gain for Barclays which was known before the sale hearing,'' a Lehman lawyer, Robert Gaffey, said at the hearing. ''Barclays sat silent in court while Lehman's lawyers described the deal to the court as a wash.'' Barclays argued that if the judge reopened the sale contract, buyers of distressed bank assets would become scarce. Lehman, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, said new evidence from 60 depositions and 100,000 documents justify forcing Barclays to give back its gains."

''In the eastern Arabic lands we don't know too much about the western Arabic countries, so when you live there you never think about going. When you live in Europe, everything is easier. For a long time, I was crazy about stuff like magic. I heard since I was a kid that they believe in this stuff and they even practice. Before I traveled around Morocco, I stayed three days in Marrakesh. I talked to this magician, Ibrahim, a Berber from south Morocco. He had a lizard he said could tell you anything you want, just pay money, give your name and your mother's name. I said I don't want the touristic stuff, I want to learn if this is true, if you have connections with the souls, the other worlds, the bad spirits. He was asking, 'Why do you need to know?' I said I'm interested so I can believe it if it is real. He told me magicians can be low level, do normal stuff, but high-level magicians, they can really control the world.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

''With everything that I design, from a church to a plate to a skyscraper to a spoon,'' he explains, ''I am always thinking about voluptuous volumes and spaces.'' Lynn pioneered so-called ''blob'' architecture -- a piece of his toy furniture is at far right -- and his appetite for the amorphous once led Time magazine to nickname him ''Mr. Softee.''

In images taken from the recent stage production of ''The Pee-wee Herman Show'' at Club Nokia in L.A., his signature gray suit and shrunken red bow tie look a little timeworn, his close-cropped black hair trying just a bit too hard to be shiny. The legendary Puppetland playhouse on the other hand, after a minor face-lift by David Korins, looks as fresh and fantastically freaky as the day it was born. The maniacally grinning furniture and appliances, the frenetic wall décor, the jarring color scheme and off-kilter angles conjure a Memphis-era cocktail lounge where all of the drinks come laced with acid. The artist and designer Gary Panter, who won three Emmy Awards for his art direction of ''Pee-wee's Playhouse,'' which ran on CBS from 1986 to 1990, has apparently exorcised his rambunctious brainchild after all these years. ''I am happy that we made a show that a lot of kids liked,'' he said in a recent e-mail message. ''Tired of talking about it.

A lifelong collector of one-of-a-kind bikes from around the world, Maharam, of the New York textile company of the same name, recently made friends with a true expert -- Sacha White, a master builder who owns Vanilla Bicycles in Portland, Ore. Together, they conceived an exhibition devoted to the work of craftsmen like White, who make a living cutting steel, welding and filing for weeks on end. (''You wouldn't want to be their manicurist,'' Maharam says.) The show, ''Bespoke: The Handbuilt Bicycle,'' which opens May 12 at the Museum of Arts and Design, collects 21 of the finest contemporary examples from America and abroad, from charming, Old World road bikes to aggressively styled titanium and steel mountain bikes. On the gallery's back wall, a set of drawings by the design firm 2x4 explains how bicycles are built. Maharam hopes the exhibition will open up the city's bicycle culture to more people. ''One reason bicycles have become so popular is because manufacturers are making the well designed and beautiful accessible to the masses,'' he says. ''This is the epitome of the well designed and beautiful.'' JESSE ASHLOCK"

Nonetheless, the adventurous spirit of the Indian sweet tooth knows no bounds. Now, thanks to a new organic farmers' market in Mumbai (Nilgiri Garden, Bandra Hindu Association, Linking Road, Bandra West), you can get a natural sugar rush - imagine eating a nimbus cloud that passed over a molasses factory - alongside local, pesticide-free food. Getting fresh produce in Mumbai has never been a problem; the market often comes to you, via a street cart vendor. But finding organic fruits and vegetables is not as easy. The farmers' market, apparently the first all-organic market in the city, hopes to change that. Kavita Mukhi, founder of Conscious Food (consciousfood.com), is the brains behind the operation, which will run every Sunday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. ''The goal is to get the whole community, particularly younger generations, thinking about a different way to live,'' Ms. Mukhi said.

Hans Knoll, an entrepreneur from a well-known German furniture-manufacturing family, and Florence Schust, an architect whose education brought her in contact with greats like Eliel Saarinen and Mies van der Rohe, married in 1946 and quickly turned Hans's small company into a design powerhouse. They recruited people like Harry Bertoia and Eero Saarinen to design groundbreaking furniture, reintroduced classics like Mies's Barcelona chair and started the Knoll Planning Unit, which under Florence's direction revolutionized office interiors. Hans died in a car accident in 1955, but Florence stayed for another 10 years. Knoll after the Knolls became a more corporate place, concentrating heavily on office systems but still caring enough about furniture to commission pieces from a who's who of design and architecture.

2010-04-11T00:00:00Z,"ROBERT WRIGHT I want to defend the proposition that, in its own way, the Tiger Woods scandal is as important as Kandahar and the Catholic Church. Leaving aside the question of whether we should shower condemnation on Woods -- a hard question that I don't purport to have a compelling answer to -- one thing I feel sure of is that this Tiger Woods thing matters. Why? Because it embodies some other things that matter. For example: Monogamous marriage matters. Compared with the alternatives, it looks pretty good as a means of rearing the next generation. It is more compatible with egalitarian, democratic values than polygamy is, and it has various advantages -- including sheer economic efficiency -- over single-parent child rearing. (All of which, I think, is an argument for legalizing gay marriage, but that's another story.) Certainly lots of spouseless parents do a great job of child rearing, and certainly divorce doesn't spell the ruin of a child. (In some cases divorce is better for the child.) Still, it's a lot easier to be sanguine about these alternatives to monogamy if we confine our gaze to the upper income brackets."

There he found an archive of flat files, filled with the stuff of a designer's dreams: pencil sketches on graph paper by Josef Hoffmann, graceful charcoal drawings of glassware by Oswald Haerdtl and renderings of complicated patterns and engraved borders by Adolf Loos. These rich supporting materials by Vienna's early-20th-century masters will be on view at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, alongside their delicate three-dimensional counterparts, beginning April 23 as part of ''Ted Muehling Selects: Lobmeyr Glass From the Permanent Collection.'' From a baroque, leaf-cut decanter by Ludwig Lobmeyr to the thin, attenuated muslin glass forms that have dominated the past half century, Muehling primarily chose pieces meant for celebration and ritual; the great thing about Lobmeyr, he says, is ''they may be opulent and insanely expensive, but for the most part the pieces are useful and functional drinking glasses.''

Mr. McLaren saw the big cultural picture of which fashion was a part, and he sensed the small vibrations long, long before they reached the mainstream. And he continued to be alert to all kinds of changes in music, art -- any form of self-presentation. It's hard, now, to recognize the world of England in the early 1970s. But when Mr. McLaren and Vivienne Westwood began their collaboration, starting with a shop on the Kings Road called Let It Rock, their ideas were genuinely shocking. At first their clothing had a '50s Teddy Boy influence -- drainpipe trousers and brothel creepers -- but then the fashion acquired a more subversive tone, joyfully using elements of fetishism and sadomasochism. Within the space of a few years, the shop's name was changed to Too Fast to Live Too Young to Die, then Sex and then Seditionaries, a name that in part reflected the hard-core slogan T-shirts that Mr. McLaren and Ms. Westwood created."

2010-04-11T00:00:00Z,"HOME IS WHERE THE ART IS: Since she was raised on a steady diet of galleries, artists, literature and design (her parents were both arts professionals), it comes as no surprise that Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn ended up as a cultural multitasker. She runs two galleries, Salon 94 -- a space within her Upper East Side home devoted mainly to performance pieces -- and a downtown space, Salon 94 Freemans. A third location, Salon 94 Bowery, is scheduled to open in September. This summer, the gallery owner/art adviser/independent curator/collector will add the unlikely title of reality-TV star to her résumé by appearing as a judge on ''Work of Art: The Next Great Artist,'' Bravo's arty answer to ''American Idol.'' ''Art is inefficient, hard to find and often difficult to grasp,'' she says. ''If showing the process of making and talking about it can appeal to a broad audience, I want to be a part of that dialogue. We ended up having a hilarious time.'' Greenberg Rohatyn will often live with a work of art before ultimately deciding to represent its maker. But when it comes to her personal collection, which includes pieces by David Hammons, Sarah Lucas, Julie Mehretu, Marilyn Minter, Richard Prince and Katy Grannan, she is not one to labor over her decisions. ''I react quickly and buy on instinct.'' STYLE AND SUBSTANCE: Greenberg Rohatyn may be on the art world's best-dressed list, but she's more into comfort than complications. ''When I opened my first gallery, I wanted to look neutral and grown-up, so I wore tailored suits,'' she says. ''Now I want to be comfortable in layers of simple materials or slip on a single item, such as a jumpsuit.'' She does have a few style eccentricities, ''like wearing mismatched earrings and a rock crystal 'specimen' necklace by Kara Hamilton,'' an artist she represents. She admires Rick Owens for his refined simplicity and pure yet radical designs. ''I wear something of his daily, whether it be a tank, a soft leather jacket, a halter top or a dress.'' She's also a huge fan of Rodarte. ''They imagine a personality and weave it into a piece of clothing.''"

2010-04-11T00:00:00Z,"We really love this piece. It's not a very glamorous story, but this table is the first piece we bought and at the time it was very expensive for us. We found it in an antique shop in Antwerp, Belgium. We were so impressed by this weird thing. We didn't know what it was, but we were drawn to it. And not just because of how it looked but because of the qualiIty of it. It's very lovingly made. We somehow scraped the money together to buy it. It's one of those objects that you position prominently and then after a while you think, Eh?, and move it somewhere less conspicuous. But you always fall back in love with it again -- maybe that is what makes it timeless. The surreal element connects to our work as fashion designers, but the table is beyond fashion. It exists on its own terms, as if it creates its own universe. It takes you out of your usual way of looking at things."

The villa, which reopened to the public in 2008, is one of four house museums that will host more than 200 pieces of 21st-century design for ''Unexpected Guests,'' one of the headline exhibitions of Milan's design week. Among other interventions are a Nacho Carbonell chair and Steven Holl credenza in the Museo Bagatti Valsecchi; ceramics by the upstart Tomás Alonso in the Casa Museo Boschi Di Stefano's Lucio Fontana gallery; and at the Museo Poldi Pezzoli, Gaetano Pesce's La Michetta modular sofa for Meritalia (right) and Front's horse-shaped lamp for Moooi, which displaced an armored steed.

2010-04-11T00:00:00Z,"Even in 3-D, Alice in Wonderland has nothing on the Surrealists, who imagined spaces far trippier than any rabbit hole. Max Ernst drew a maiden trapped inside a giant zoetrope; Alberto Giacometti created rooms strung with a spinal column and other oddities; and Salvador Dalí's famous ''Dream of Venus'' installation, at the 1939 World's Fair, was an aquatic funhouse filled with topless women and a rubber cow udder. For the exhibition ''The Surreal House,'' which opens June 10 at London's Barbican gallery, the curators have worked with the architects Carmody Groarke to bring these dreamscapes to life, constructing a labyrinth of rooms and corridors that immerse visitors in the art, films and furnishings of the movement's original and contemporary practitioners. ''The idea is to radically alter the space so that you're not sure what's up, what's down or where it finishes,'' says Alona Pardo, an assistant curator at the Barbican. Rather than imagining surreal interiors, the sculptors Claude and François-Xavier Lalanne furnished them. Their zoologically inspired pieces are now on view at the Les Arts Décoratifs in Paris, including hippo-shaped bathtubs and a bed that resembles a can of sardines. The retrospective also includes pieces designed for Yves Saint Laurent's apartment, exhibited here for the first time. MONICA KHEMSUROV"
2010-04-11T00:00:00Z,"LLEWELLYN--J. Bruce. The New York Law School community mourns the passing of one of its most distinguished alumni, J. Bruce Llewellyn, Class of 1960. A former trustee of New York Law School, Mr. Llewellyn was an outstanding entrepreneur, public servant, activist, and philanthropist. He was Chairman and CEO of The Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company and founder of the original chapter of ""100 Black Men."" Born in Harlem, Mr. Llewellyn earned a bachelor's degree from City College, a J.D. from New York Law School, an M.B.A. from Columbia University, and a degree in public administration from New York University. During the 1960's, he served as Regional Director of the U.S. Small Business Administration and as Deputy Commissioner of Housing for the City of New York. In 1969, Mr. Llewellyn bought Fedco Foods Corporation, a supermarket chain in the Bronx. By 1984, it had become the nation's largest minority-owned retail business. He went on to purchase the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company, and then acquired the Wilmington, Delaware Coca-Cola bottling operations. President Carter appointed Mr. Llewellyn President of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in 1977, and he served as Ambassador at Large until 1981. Later, President Clinton appointed him Chairman of the U.S. Small Business Administration Advisory Council. In recognition of his extraordinary leadership and service to the cause of human rights, New York Law School awarded Mr. Llewellyn with the Distinguished Alumni Award in 1979 and the President's Medal of Honor in 2004. He has also been honored by the Law School's Black Law Students Association. New York Law School is proud to claim him as one of our most illustrious alumni.

Kindle Living aims to give the heat lamp an image makeover by reimagining it as an actual lamp. The three models currently in production come complete with pleated shades, curvaceous bases (to hide unsightly propane tanks) and an array of colors, like black -- perfect for that post-Oscar bash -- or pale pink for a poolside sweet 16.

2010-04-11T00:00:00Z,"NICOLA DE THOMASIS, a round-bellied, bearded, bespectacled man from the rough-hewn hills of Abruzzo, stood near the head of his dinner table, holding a pair of tongs -- and my fate -- in his hand. He had already placed on my plate an almost lethally large portion of spaghetti alla chitarra, dressed with the region's traditional tomato-and-lamb ragù, and his tong-bearing hand kept inching closer and closer to the communal pasta platter until, at last, he dove in with the instrument, scooped up a final, fatal tangle of noodles and added them to my dish. I was done for. But if I was going to die, this was absolutely the way to go. I had already sampled the family's wild-boar sausage, chunky prosciutto whose craggy appearance belied juicy depths, and sharp pecorino from the sheep that outnumber the humans in Abbateggio, this village (population 420) at the edge of Majella National Park. The spaghetti was thick and toothsome, made by the expert hands of Nicola's wife, Nicoletta, who'd sliced it on a chitarra, a guitarlike box of wires that gives the pasta flat, almost crisp edges. After that would come more: lamb chops, breaded and fried and drizzled with lemon, their rib bones arcing elegantly away from the meat; simple roasted potatoes; Savoy cabbage sautéed into the warm, vegetal equivalent of a grandmother's hug."

2010-04-11T00:00:00Z,"This spring at the Prado Museum (museodelprado.es), an exhibition pays homage to that institution's - and perhaps Spain's - most treasured painting, ''Las Meninas'' (1656) by Velazquez. In what is likely to be a true once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston has lent John Singer Sargent's famous painting ''The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit'' (1882), which many art historians call the ''American Meninas'' to be displayed next to the Velazquez painting. The loan is part of the Prado's series of ''Invited Work'' exhibitions, which bring individual works of special importance or resonance to the museum, to be seen in proximity to the Prado's collection. Boit was an American painter and art collector who lived an expatriate life in Paris with his wife and eight children. Sargent's enigmatic painting of his four daughters has become as much an emblem of the American Gilded Age as Velazquez's picture is of the 17th-century Spanish court. Both painters used the candid and confident gaze of a young girl of privilege - Infanta Margarita was just 5 years old when Velazquez immortalized her on canvas, and Julia Boit was 4 when Sargent painted her - to engage the viewer. And both pieces go beyond traditional portraiture to offer compositions of complexity."

2010-04-11T00:00:00Z,"THE library of my youth, in Ocean Township, N.J., was a tomb of peace, where the only sounds were shuffles, whispers and the occasional shush -- delivered with an index finger crossing the lips of a bespectacled, cardigan-wearing librarian.

2010-04-11T00:00:00Z,"Depending on how you look at it, the venerable Centre Georges Pompidou, designed by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano, will get either a new sibling or a new rival next month, when a branch opens to the public in Metz, France. The Centre Pompidou-Metz's inaugural exhibition has blockbuster written all over it; the coyly titled ''Masterpieces?'' will feature some 800 of the world's most prized modern works, from Alexander Calder's ''Josephine Baker IV'' to Yves Klein's ''Grande anthropophagie bleue (ANT 76).'' A TGV rail link makes the museum an easy 80-minute trip from Paris. And then there is the building itself. Conceived by Shigeru Ban and Jean de Gastines as a series of modules around a central spire, it is flamboyantly capped by an undulating lattice roof structure (made from 11 miles of glue-laminated timber beams) and sheathed in a fiberglass and Teflon membrane that gives the place an otherworldly glow when lit up at night. All the better for stealing the spotlight. ALIX BROWNE"
2010-04-11T00:00:00Z,"According to Ver Bien Para Aprender Mejor (''See Well to Learn Better''), a program sponsored by the Mexican government, about one-tenth of the country's children do poorly in school simply because they can't see well. That's not just because glasses are expensive, but also because in Mexico they're often perceived as evidence of a handicap. In an attempt to address both problems, Ver Bien turned to the industrial designer Yves Béhar, who, as the creator of the One Laptop Per Child XO (the original $100 computer), has earned a reputation as a maker of inexpensive, attractive products for kids in the developing world. Béhar designed a set of split frames, which makes the glasses less costly to assemble in the field and lets kids customize them using a smorgasbord of color options. ''They're at the intersection of practicality and personal expression,'' Béhar says. With the help of Augen, the manufacturer, Ver Bien can keep the total cost -- including an eye exam and shipping -- at just $10. This year alone, it will give away 400,000 pairs. ''This is about using the very best not to make the most expensive product,'' Béhar says, ''but to make the most valuable product -- and to make it efficiently.'' JESSE ASHLOCK"

""Jersey Boys,"" which tells the story of Frankie Valli and his rock group, the Four Seasons, has remained a popular and lucrative show since it opened on Broadway in 2005 (and won the Tony Award for best musical), spawning several regional productions and a national tour.

2010-04-12T14:15:37Z,"""Two recent scholars have read the obituary for historical Jesus studies. James D. G. Dunn ... argues that the furthest we can get behind the Gospels is to the underlying strata of Jesus as his earliest followers remembered him. That is as far as we can go. That is the Jesus who gave rise to the Christian faith, and that is the only Jesus worth pursuing ... Dale Allison, whom I consider the most knowledgeable New Testament scholar in the United States, is less sanguine and more cynical than Dunn ... After three decades of work in and around the historical Jesus, Allison sketches the variety of views about the historical Jesus and the supposed modern theory that if we put our heads together we will arrive at firm conclusions. Allison offers this depressing conclusion: ""Progress has not touched all subjects equally, and whatever consensus may exist, it remains mostly boring."" Allison admits this about one of his own books on Jesus: ""I opened my eyes to the obvious: I had created a Jesus in my own image, after my own likeness."" He's not done: ""Professional historians are not bloodless templates passively registering the facts: we actively and imaginatively project. Our rationality cannot be extricated from our sentiments and feelings, our hopes and fears, our hunches and ambitions."" So, he ponders, ""Maybe we have unthinkingly reduced biography [of Jesus] to autobiography."""

2010-04-12T11:43:37Z,"More on Father Kiesle | Melinda Costello was a 7-year-old parishioner in the late 1960s in Fremont, Calif., when the Rev. Stephen Kiesle first playfully invited her to sit on his lap. Ms. Costello, now 48, recalled that as the tickling and touching quickly progressed to fondling her chest and genitals, Mr. Kiesle justified his behavior as exorcism and ""told me the devil was inside me,"" she said in an interview with The New York Times. Emerging accounts like Ms. Costello's in California churches have intensified pressure on the pope. As Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then a top Vatican official overseeing clergy, he sent a letter in 1985 to Bishop John S. Cummins of Oakland, who had repeatedly voiced concerns about Father Kiesle, saying that the case needed more time and that the ""good of the universal church"" should be considered before moving to discipline the priest."

''I like to make shiny, colorful art pieces that appeal to our dreams and urges but actually deal with decay or disillusion,'' says the Brussels-based Olinet. Apply with caution.

As the Deputy President of World ORT and as a past president and a leader of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, he traveled the world visiting programs and projects and was passionately involved in the full scope of the work of the two organizations meeting critical human needs across the globe. On behalf of World ORT he dedicated himself to ensuring that Jewish students and adults received the best possible general and Jewish education to prepare themselves for a future of self sufficiency. In the short time he served as Deputy President he proved to be an invaluable resource for the professional and volunteer leadership of World ORT. We extend our deepest condolences to his beloved wife, Stephanie; his son, Charles and his wife, Patty; his daughter Betsy and her husband, Richard; and to his seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. May his memory be for a blessing.

Run by Nina Yashar, the gallery-cum-high-end-design-boutique specializes in antique design masterpieces as well as newly commissioned works by young designers. The standout at this year's exhibition, however, was a bit old and a bit new. The designer Barnaba Fornasetti, son of the legendary Piero Fornasetti, has made newly commissioned pieces out of some of his father's classic collaborations with the famed designer Gio Ponti. Instead of making these pieces in the high-gloss lacquer that is a Fornasetti trademark, these new works are covered in the original zinc lithographic plates that papa Fornasetti used to print his famous designs. The matte gray zinc is embellished in a black etched patchwork of flowers, trompe l'oeil books, faux bois and more. The zinc plates are attached to the wooden construction of the furniture by way of utilitarian yet decorative nail heads. The collection consists of two desks, a tall secretary desk, a chair, a chandelier and a wardrobe (in which Barnaba has even placed some of his own idiosyncratic Fornasetti printed suits, vests and shirts). All of the pieces are unique and are destined to become instant, if remixed, classics."

She was the first female president of the Jewish Federation of New Orleans from 1959 to 1961; a cofounder in 1960 of the New Orleans Lemann Stern Young Leadership Group, which educates young Jewish women and men in leadership skills and philanthropy; and, in 1962, of the Home for the Jewish Aged, now Woldenberg Village. She developed educational programs for New Orleans's Jewish women: the New Orleans Enduring Heritage Institute, 19651972; a forum for presidents of Jewish women's organizations, 1980s; and a Torah study group, 19851993. At the national level, she was the first elected female vice president of the American Council of Jewish Federations, 19631965, and she was in the leadership of Hadassah. She was a founding member of the National Foundation for Jewish Culture (NFJC) in 1960. Possessing physical beauty, charm, idealism, and determination, she was just 19 when she and husband Joe honeymooned at the 1929 World Zionist Congress in Zurich, at which the Jewish Agency was born. They were soon (erroneously) reported killed in Arab-Jewish skirmishes in Palestine. 75 years later she became a refugee of Hurricane Katrina. In the years between, she built a family and was a cherished friend and mentor. New Orleans was her home, but the institutions that she inspired extend nationally and internationally. She once said, simply, ""I have had a vision of what a Jewish community ought to be, and I felt I had a responsibility."" Funeral services were held in New Orleans on Sunday, April 11 at Congregation Shir Chadash."

The daughter of George Ivanovich Gurdjieff and Jessmin Howarth, Dushka was a multifaceted and highly creative woman: in early life, a publicist for such renown entertainers in the Harlem jazz scene as Nat King Cole and Dick Hymen; later, a talented popular singer with a huge multicultural repertory; still later, returning to her roots, a dedicated teacher and advisor for the Gurdjieff Sacred Dances. She devoted her last years to preserving the heritage of her father and mother, in part by founding the Gurdjieff Heritage Society. Her archival efforts resulted in the publication of a complete set of Gurdjieff's harmonium music in 2005, and soon after recordings of the original orchestral scores for Gurdjieff's Oriental Suite. In 2009, she published a 500 page memoir and family photo album, ""It's Up To Ourselves"": A Mother, A Daughter, and Gurdjieff. Dushka was truly unique. She will be remembered.

Drawn to painting, she studied art and art history, receiving a B.A. from Columbia University and an M.F.A. from The University of North Carolina. In 1952, she traveled throughout Europe, where in Rome she met her husband, the Italian artist Piero Dorazio. They married in 1953. She witnessed and participated in Italy's burgeoning post-war art scene and spent two decades traveling between Europe and New York, becoming acquainted with many artists and leading figures in the European and American art world, whom she often photographed. She and Piero divorced in 1983, but remained good friends. She authored two books: Balla: An Album of his Life and Work, an early book in English on the Italian Futurist painter, and later, Peggy Guggenheim and her Friends. Though she never forgot Little Rock, she spent her last decades in the city she loved, New York. Eternally curious, she passed many enjoyable hours doing research for her books at the city's great libraries and museums. She will be forever missed by her friends and family for her beautiful blue eyes, warm smile, generous heart, colorful stories, and tart conversation. She is survived by her adoring son, Justin Dortch Dorazio, Samantha Dunham, and three grandchildren, Katherine, Mark, and James.

2010-04-15T10:40:11Z,"I'm late turning to Jeffrey Goldberg's mammoth New Yorker story on Mark and Delia Owens, a pair of celebrated conservationists who apparently went vigilante in their struggle against poachers in Zambia's North Luangwa National Park, but I wanted both to recommend the piece (it's the fastest-moving 17,000 words you'll read this month), and to remark on how surprised I was, all things considered, to find myself feeling sympathetic toward its off-the-reservation subjects. The tenor is appropriately prosecutorial: Goldberg builds an extensive, persuasive case that the Owenses' much-lauded environmental activism in the Zambian hinterland led to at least one murder, and maybe more. The victim was a poacher; the killers were probably game scouts who were trained by the Owenses as a kind of private army (and encouraged to take the fight to hunters) - and the fatal gunshots, Goldberg plausibly contends, may have been fired by Mark Owens' own son, Christopher. (Remarkably, the murder was captured on camera by an ABC documentary crew sometime in 1995; even more remarkably, it was then broadcast, on an episode of the newsmagazine show ""Turning Point"" in 1996.)"

Would it be about how the show dealt with news events like the 9/11 attacks, and helped reflect opinions on political figures like George W. Bush, Al Gore, John Kerry and Sarah Palin? Or, like Shimmer, the floor polish that's also a dessert topping, would it be both?"

2010-04-15T10:09:47Z,"""Getting rid of the old punitive morality that surrounded sexuality seemed like it would do no one any harm, and relieve a lot of unnecessary anguish and guilt. But young people have not reacted to it as theorised. They will gladly skip the 'morality' part. But in a world as socially competitive as that of teen dating, the 'punitive' part is simply too useful a tool to do without. So people proclaim themselves free of moral hang-ups, and yet throw around words like 'slut' and 'whore' with an abandon that no previous generation ever did. It is unlikely there was any moral disapproval in the taunts to which [Phoebe] Prince was allegedly exposed. It might have been better if there had been. Moral pretensions might have led her alleged tormenters to look at their own conduct, and reined them in. In place of moralism we have nothing but the will to power and the desire to ostracise - a values system that differs from the old one only in its arbitrariness."""
2010-04-15T10:07:31Z,"PORTLAND, Ore. -- The regular season came to a bizarre end here Wednesday night, in a game between the league's two most injury-depleted teams. As the playoff-bound Trail Blazers mostly rested their key players in a game that had no consequence for their postseason positioning, the low-run Golden State Warriors brought just eight players. Two of them (Ronny Turiaf and Anthony Morrow) were declared unfit to play by the team's trainer during warmups. Midway through the first quarter, center Chris Hunter aggravated his knee. So Coach Don Nelson, who recently became the career victories leader, used five players for the rest of the game."

Sebald and enjoy grim Scottish films with subtitles, supernally addictive. Not always and (let's hope!) not forever, but in the right now of it. Sure, sometimes one is simply not in the mood for all that virtual id, the jawing and bitching, the glaring white teeth and the faux familiarity. And it is possible to envision a day in the not-too-far-off future when one might return to an old-fashioned pastime, like doing one's nails, over the vicarious pleasures of comparing and contrasting the suntans and blown-out blondness that beset the Real Housewives of Orange County. Meanwhile, though, one stays tuned, fascinated by the mindless commotion, caught on the hook of the souped-up dramas that barge into every episode, unsure whether one is watching a version of oneself or a counter-version or perhaps an alternate version. Which brings me to the question: Who might one be if one were to be played by a reality-show star? Who might one want to be?"

2010-04-15T00:00:00Z,"ROOSEVELT--Emily. The extended Roosevelt and Foehl families mourn the death of our dear Emily who passed away suddenly and unexpectedly on April 11, 2010, at home in Park City, Utah. Born in White Plains, New York on August 13, 1969, Emily demonstrated to all who knew and loved her that she would live life to the fullest with no regrets. Empathy, inquisitiveness, courage, and determination defined her daily life. Emily graduated from Whitby School, The Millbrook School, the University of Virginia, and the University of Maine School of Law. She served with distinction as a law clerk for The Honorable Judge Monroe McKay of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Salt Lake City from 1997 to 2000. In 2000, until her death, she worked in the Regional Solicitor's office of the United States Department of the Interior in Salt Lake City, Utah where she worked tirelessly on behalf of public land issues. In June 2008, Emily received the greatest gift of all a new heart. We want to thank the team at University of Utah Hospital for giving her the best care possible. We also extend our profound thanks to Emily's donor and family for giving her a new lease on life. Since receiving her new heart, Emily became an outspoken advocate for organ donation and patient care, helping to raise funds and awareness, supporting others going through the transplant process, and serving as the master of ceremonies for the ribbon cutting of the Patient Care Pavilion at the University of Utah Hospital in July 2009. Emily will be forever missed and celebrated by all her ""stars and angels"" including her husband, Peter Foehl; her sons Mason and Liam; her parents Chris and Roddy Roosevelt; her sister Kate and her partner Caroline; her brother Chris, his wife Christina, and their sons Noah and Wylie; her in-laws Allen and Sally Foehl; Pete's brother Chas, his wife Sara, and their children Walker and Reed; Pete's brother Dave and his wife Carol; her beloved grandmother Rosalind E.

AUSTRALIA Yes, there are less populated places -- the South Pole is perhaps the most extreme option. But for secluded locations you might actually want to live in, Australia is full possibilities. Consider, for starters, the State of the Northern Territory: With a land mass of around 550,000 square miles, it is more than three times the size of California, but has a population of 227,000 (about the same as Birmingham, Ala.). It gets better: More than half of the state's residents live in the capital, Darwin. That leaves the other 549,960 square miles to around 100,000 people. Average it out, and each Outback loner gets 3,520 acres all to him or herself."

But the more improbable corollary is that rap-rock, the widely derided late-1990s fusion that dominated FM rock radio for a few tedious years, is recovering some of its early promise. The day's first blast of it was by P.O.S., a Minnesota rapper who details setbacks, struggles, contradictions and small, hard-won successes: ""I can never be what I want to be/Nothing but a man,"" he rapped. His rhymes are fast, with jagged rhythms; his band pounds without steamrollering him, and he keeps his shoutalongs simple enough to keep the crowd with him: ""Yeah right!"" went one, ""Yeah,"" went another."
