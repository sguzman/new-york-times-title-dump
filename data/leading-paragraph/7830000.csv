2014-12-28T00:00:00Z,"MARINO--Robert A.,passed away on the December 21st winter solstice, which is a celebration of being ""born again""--not of flesh, but of the spirit. He courageously fought brain cancer for 18 months, remaining eloquent, dignified, gracious and flirtatious, until the very end. Despite a difficult childhood and the untimely death of his mother, Bob led a life of leadership and service to others. He graduated from Copiague High School in 1971. He was editor-in-chief of the student newspaper, The Maverick, garnering numerous awards. He spearheaded the fight against school newspaper censorship, leading him to take on state politicians in Albany which included a colorful exchange with Governor Rockefeller! He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Syracuse University in 1975. After moving to NYC, he enjoyed brief political successes before catching the real estate bug. He went on to study Real Estate Finance at Columbia University Graduate School of Business, earning his degree in 1982. Soon afterwards, he established his practice and became one of the top real estate appraisers in the state of New York. His keen sense for the booming market led him to purchase a condo at auction on the upper west side, at Columbus Common. Serving as Board President for ten years, he was instrumental in knitting together a cohesive and friendly community, creating opportunities for strangers to become friends. He was well known for his beautiful terrace garden, and he loved hosting weekly dinners with his friends, which came to be known as ""family dinners"". He opened his home, heart and wallet to friends and animals in need, providing shelter, food and comfort. He gave generously without a desire for acknowledgement or recognition. Bob was a passionate animal advocate adopting numerous cats and dogs throughout his life. He always had a treat in his pocket for every dog he met on his daily walks through the neighborhood and Central Park. His beloved Akita, Bella, was the motivation behind the fight to keep off leash privileges for dogs in NYC parks when the city sued to ban it forever in 2006. As president of NYCDOG, Bob brought thousands of people together and led a victorious campaign that resulted in the 9pm to 9am off leash privileges. Every dog owner in NYC owes a huge debt of gratitude to Bob Marino for this remarkable achievement. His close friends describe Bob as: handsome, charming, intelligent, unwaveringly loyal and fair, great listener with a huge heart, unfiltered sense of humor, lover of all blondes, playfully naughty, staunch Democrat, and matchmaker of people and animals. All of his friends' children regarded him as a beloved uncle. He never had an unkind word to say about anyone, unless they were Republican! He is survived by his loving sister Mary, who was his fierce advocate and caretaker for the last part of his life, his father and stepmother, five additional siblings, and extended family. In addition, Bob leaves behind hundreds of friends across the globe, whose lives he has impacted and changed for the better. A celebration of life was held for Bob this past May at his favorite restaurant in NYC, with over 200 people and animals in attendance. Ever generous, Bob donated his body to Rutgers University for research. Bob's final wish is for everyone to share their lives by adopting rescue pets who need love. For those who prefer to donate as a tribute to Bob, he encouraged and helped sponsor a new animal rescue in 2012 -Home Sweet Home of Long Island, 273 Walt Whitman Road #"

Mrs. Gray came from a family of German-Irish decent who arrived in America in the early 1700's, many participating in the American Revolution. Prominent among them was Charles Carroll of Maryland, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Mrs. Gray was born in Salt Lake City on October 26, 1918 to Denise Karrick Bintz and Charles Carroll Bintz. She grew up in Salt Lake City where she attended Roland Hall and East High School and later graduating from Stanford University. Among her proudest moments were a startling 93 on a physics exam at Roland Hall, numerous equestrian firsts in the Salt Lake City Horse Show, most notably for Ladies Jumping, and her BA from Stanford where she was a member of the Pi Phi sorority. A devoted wife of 72 years, Mrs. Gray married Sherman Gray in October 1942. The son of Prentiss Nathaniel Gray and Laura Sherman, his family also includes a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Roger Sherman of Connecticut. Sherm received his BA from Harvard where he led the crew team to win the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley, England in 1939. After graduation, he joined the US Navy and served as a naval aviator flying a PBY aircraft in defense of the Aleutians Islands while Bobbie remained in Salt Lake. After the war the pair moved to New York where he joined Henry Schroder Banking Corporation. They began their several moves to and from Europe while Sherman worked for Schroder's Bank and later Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith. When Sherm was assigned abroad, Mrs. Gray moved the entire family, first to Switzerland, then France, then on to London before returning finally to the U.S. where she became a founding member of the Junior League of Long Island. The frequent moves involved the conversion of some 15 residences into gracious homes for her family and provided her with many spectacular recipes which she cooked with aplomb. Mrs. Gray is predeceased by her first daughter, Pamela Carroll Gray, of Newport Beach, CA, the late wife of Lowell Martindale. She is survived by her husband of 72 years, Sherman; her second daughter, Elizabeth Gray Lilleston and husband Richard D.

Steinberg of Morristown, NJ; six grandchildren and their spouses: Jessica Carroll Chu, Pamela Sherman Lilleston and James Noe; Amanda January Lilleston and Justin Dimmel; Matthew Putnam Gray, Zachary Sherman Gray, and Nathaniel Prentiss Gray.

2015-02-01T00:00:00Z,"EINSIDLER--Mimi Mandelbaum. Passed away on January 24, 2015 in Boca Raton, FL. She was predeceased by her loving husband of 65 years, Fred. She was a loving mother and mother-in-law to son Jon (Karen) Einsidler and daughter Amy (Keith) Lewis and adored her grandchildren Bobby, Laura, Billy, Nina, Teddy and Scott. She was also a loving sister and sister- in-law to David (Rosemary) Mandelbaum. She was born in New York City on October 23, 1929 and grew up on the Upper Westside of New York. She attended the Fashion Institute of Technology. She left college to marry Fred and moved with him to Ann Arbor where he received his master's degree. She moved back to New York and was pregnant with Jon when Fred deployed in the Army to Korea during that war. Mimi was an avid reader of both The New York Times daily and books of all kinds. She possessed a keen mind and was a marvelous conversationalist across a broad range of topics from international and national events to pop culture, movies, novels, and television. Her contemporary attitude made her a sought out person for many of Jon and Amy's friends. She had a zest for life and a strong imagination. As a den mother, her most memorable cub scout trip was taking the troop to Belmont race track for a tour of the grounds and the stables. Mimi was a lady who always knew the ""right"" thing to do, could look elegant when dressed for the occasion but felt most comfortable in jeans and sneakers which she could wear effortlessly. When her grandchildren asked what Grandma Mimi looked like when she was younger, we would just point out the woman holding the torch at the beginning of a Columbia Pictures movie and say that was their grandmother when she was young. After Amy was born, the family moved to Long Island. In retrospect, this was an obvious move since the beach suited her perfectly. Years later, there were not many other women who could wear a bikini well into their 40s and look great like she did. She was at home at the beach chatting with friends or sitting alone and reading a book. The best days were ones she referred to as 7 o'clock beach days, when we were the last ones to leave. She also had this thing for lilacs. For Mimi, family was everything. She looked forward to holidays when the entire family would get together. As one could imagine, her ""high holy day"" was Mother's Day. As our family evolved, Mother's Day saw a different convergence as we moved the celebration to Rochester when Amy started her family and Mother's Day coincided with the Lilac Festival. Mimi was fond of saying that the success of a mother is shown in her children. She beamed with pride at what her children had become and the people her grandchildren were becoming. Mom will be sorely missed by her family and friends who all loved her as much as she loved them. The funeral will be held graveside for family at Westchester Hills Cemetery on February 1 at 10am. The family will sit shiva on February 1 from noon to 4pm at Jon Einsidler's house, 93 Downey Drive, Tenafly, NJ. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the American Heart Association. 1/3"

John was the youngest son of Ray and Frances Leffler of Brooklyn, New York. John was born in Brooklyn and raised in Spotswood, New Jersey. He attended Ursinus College where he played basketball, and eventually transferred to Rutgers University. He then earned his MBA at Farleigh Dickinson University. John met the love of his life Emi when they were both 19. They would later marry and raise three beautiful children, Michele, Kelly, and Brian. Upon graduation, John went to work for Combustion Engineering, and in 1987 joined Touche Ross, which was the start of a long and very prosperous consulting career. Most recently, John was the Managing Partner of IBM Global Business Services SAP practice and was well known and respected as a prominent leader in the consulting industry. John was a long time partner at IBM, PwC, and Price Waterhouse where he built and grew the SAP business to one of the largest and most successful, award winning consulting practices globally. During his tenure at IBM, John led some of their largest and most complex SAP business transformation programs and pioneered many revolutionary business design and implementation strategies. His innovative spirit and tremendous success led him to be widely respected and sought after as a thought leader, regularly speaking at SAP events and advising his clients and SAP alike on strategy, innovation and market trends. Over the course of his decades long career, John developed a devoted following of mentees, friends, and colleagues. Eminently personable, he was a born leader who inspired trust and confidence in all those around him and his relentless dedication to IBM and its clients' success allowed him to become a friend and trusted advisor to scores of IBMers and clients alike. Outside of work John enjoyed playing basketball and was an avid sports enthusiast. He was an animal and nature lover, and wine connoisseur. He also supported many non- profit organizations and charities including sitting on the board of NPower PA, among other boards and charitable interests. But his pride and joy was his family, his beloved wife Emi, twin daughters Michele and Kelly, and son Brian. Despite his extremely demanding work schedule, John always made his family his number one priority. He was a devoted husband and father, and was an instrumental force in the lives of his children. Whether it be coaching their basketball teams, participating in their various school events, or simply just being a dad, he was a role model and inspiration to his children. John's legacy is not only his family and the successful business that he built but also his unwavering loyalty to others. There was no better friend than John. He was loved, admired and respected by many who were blessed to have known him and be part of his extended family. John's mark on all who had the good fortune of knowing him will be felt for many years. John was laid to rest on Monday January 12, 2015 at Holy Cross Cemetery in East Brunswick, New Jersey, surrounded by family and friends. John's family has established the John J.

2015-02-01T00:00:00Z,"ROCKEFELLER--Harriot. Harriot ""Sue"" Rockefeller, died peacefully early Christmas morning surrounded by her children and grandchildren. A former resident of Riverside and Greenwich, Connecticut, for the last four years, she had been living in Newton, Massachusetts. Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease over a decade earlier, Mrs. Rockefeller recently suffered a stroke. Sue was born in New York City to Otto Harry and Harriot Coffin Gruner, and she grew up on the south shore of Long Island in Hewlett, New York, where she loved to boat, fish and swim in the Great South Bay and at the Rockaway Hunt and Lawrence Beach Clubs. Sue graduated from the Westover School in Middlebury, Connecticut, and a week after his college graduation married her brother's Andover and Yale roommate, Hank Ross. Hank had been Navy ROTC at college, and Sue followed him on assignment during the Korean War to Coronado, California where their first child Ripley was born and later to Newport, Rhode Island, where Wendy Ross joined the family. Sue and Hank moved to Dallas, Texas for a short time, where Larry Ross arrived, and then to the Philadelphia and New York City suburbs, finally settling in Greenwich, Connecticut where her third daughter Kate was born, and where Sue resided for the next fifty years. Sue Ross was an incredibly warm and loving mother who epitomized all the very best things about a dedicated, doting mom, wife and homemaker in the suburban 1960's. Married to an advertising and pharmaceuticals executive, Sue was as much a part of Hank Ross' business and social success as he. When Hank succumbed to the excesses of the 1970's, Sue stood strong for herself and for her family. In 1979, she married Andy Rockefeller, and Sue began a new life chapter, moving from Riverside to Greenwich; Todds Point to Prouts Neck and from skating at Binney Park to skiing in Zermatt; different venues but with Sue unchanged in her values and fierce commitment to her family and her faith. Sues time with Andy brought each new found peace and contentment. Throughout her life, Sue dedicated herself to helping others, and for years was a Nurse's Aide at Greenwich Hospital, overseeing many blood drives at Christ Church. A long-standing member of Stanwich Congregational Church, Sue served as a Stephen Minister, counseling and helping those in need. Sue Rockefeller moved to Newton in 2010 next door to her youngest daughter Kate, and immersed herself into a wonderful, loving environment, embedded into the lives of her daughter, son-in-law Charlie and her Johnson grandsons. Sue is survived by her beloved brother and sister-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. O.H. Gruner III of Pittsburgh, PA; Ripley Ross of West Hartford, CT; Wendy Carothers of Arlington, VA; Kate Johnson of Newton, MA and Larry Ross of Manchester Village, VT, as well as fifteen grandchildren and one great grandchild, with another on the way, due in May.

Carroll was born in Greenville, South Carolina, to Helen Brown and William Carroll McDaniel. After attending Converse College she moved to New York City, where she worked as a model. She lived in Paris with her first husband, Alfonso Cabeza de Vaca y Leighton, Marques de Portago during the 1950s, until his death in 1957.

Among the ones closest to their heart were New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Museum of Modern Art, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which opened the Carroll and Milton Petrie European Sculpture Court in 1990. Carroll continued supporting these and other organizations after Milton's death in 1994.

Fordham University and its Board of Trustees mourns the loss of Ann Mara, matriarch of the New York Giants football dynasty, ""first lady of football,"" and longtime friend and supporter of Fordham. ""We have lost a great woman today, a woman of many talents, and a great soul,"" said Joseph M. McShane, S.J., president of Fordham. ""She was indeed the first lady of Fordham football, but she was so much more than that: a keen businesswoman; a devout Catholic; a loving mother; a generous philanthropist; and a warm colleague. I know the Fordham community joins me today in mourning her loss, and in keeping the Mara family in our thoughts and prayers."" Mrs. Mara is the widow of longtime Giants owner Wellington Mara, a 1937 graduate of Fordham College at Rose Hill. She was awarded an honorary degree from Fordham in 2008, and in 2012 received Fordham's Walsh Award, given each year to an individual who best exemplifies the support, loyalty, and passion for Fordham football. Mrs. Mara's connection to Fordham football dates back to the 1930s, when her future husband, Wellington, a classmate of Vince Lombardi, would bring her to University sporting events. The Mara family has multiple ties to the University: John Mara, the Giants' president and CEO, is a 1979 graduate of Fordham Law School and several of Ann's Mara's grandchildren attended the University. Wellington and John Mara are also recipients of honorary degrees from Fordham, and Wellington Mara received one of the University's first Founder's Awards. ""During our courtship, [Wellington] dragged me to every football game and every basketball game,"" Mrs. Mara said when she accepted the Walsh Award. ""That was his idea of a romantic night."" In conferring an honorary doctorate of humane letters upon her in 2008, Fordham said of Mrs. Mara, ""She is the matriarch; literally as a mother, grandmother, and great- grandmother, and figuratively, for the extended New York Giants family, a family that includes scores of players and hundreds of Giants alumni. Indeed, through it all: the defeats, the personal losses and the memorable triumphs, Ann Mumm Mara has been there."" 1/3"

She was born in Brooklyn, NY on September 25, 1948 to Bertha (Rothfeld) Goldberg and Theodore Goldberg. Following graduation from Brooklyn College, Marilyn worked as a buyer for the Ohrbachs chain of department stores. Marilyn and her loving husband of 43 years, Mark, raised their three children (Susan Swinkin, David, and Daniel) in Stony Brook, NY with love and whimsy. Over the years, Marilyn created many fun-filled, unforgettable experiences for their children including annual pumpkin picking trips, Halloween and April Fool's Day dinners.

After focusing on raising their children for many years, Marilyn returned to school to become a registered nurse. She worked as an RN at the SUNY Stony Brook Hospital for three years, followed by 10 years at the University's Student Health Center. Marilyn was extraordinarily kind and giving; people who considered her a true and trusted friend are too numerous to count. She would safely escort insects outside of her home rather than see them harmed. The joie de vivre she exuded was contagious. She loved to dance, adding to the merriment of many celebrations by doing so. Words cannot express the deep sense of loss experienced by Marilyn's family and friends.

2015-02-06T00:00:00Z,"BOCKMAN--Jeanne Lafont Passed quietly at her home in New York City, the late evening of January 29, 2015. Jeanne was 102 3, lived an active and engaged life until immediately before her peaceful death. She was beloved by her great-grandchildren: Adalay, Tate, Raphael, Nora, Calvin and Linus; her grandchildren: Peter Wachtel (recently deceased), Alexander Bockman and Danielle Shalov with their devoted spouses Phoebe and Gregory; and her deceased daughter, Laura Wachtel and her devoted son Richard Bockman, M.D., PhD. Jeanne Marie Mathilde Lafont was born in Noyon France to Rachel Marinere and Pierre Bernard Lafont on April 20, 1912. As a young child, with her sister (Andree Lafont Quatremain) and mother, she had to flee to Chateauroux to evade the German forces advancing in the early days of World War I. Her father served in the French army and died soon after the war. With their family home destroyed, the mother and daughters moved to Paris. She subsequently worked on the editorial staff of Plon Publishing. In the early 1930s, she met her American-born husband, William H Bockman, a medical student at the University of Paris. Their travels to Berlin and throughout Italy in 1937 raised their concerns about consolidating fascism in Europe and led to their return to New York City where they subsequently raised their family and lived a full and active life. William died at the age of 89. Jeanne lived a long and good life surrounded by her devoted family who gained their moral strength from her core values. She will be missed but never forgotten by the many especially Alexander and Danielle, their mother Dr. Darcy B Kelley, Solange and Evelyne Quatremain, Richard and Gale (Hayman). We extend our deepest appreciation to the excellent medical staffs at the Hospital for Special Surgery, New York Presbyterian Hospital and to Shaline Murther for her loving care of our beloved Jeanne. Much appreciation to Clover Lyttle and Marie Richard for their kind and comforting assistance. Lasting appreciation to the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House and the Carter Burden Center, outstanding charitable institutions that deserve more support for their conscious caring. Her life will be celebrated at a memorial to be held at St. John the Martyr at 11am on February 21, 2015. 250 East 72nd Street, New York, NY. 1/3"

It was with shock and immense grief that members of the Board of the American Foundation for The Courtauld Institute of Art (AFCIA) learned of the tragic loss of its Vice President, Dr. Walter Liedtke. Dr. Liedtke, an eminent art-historian, author and distinguished curator completed his doctoral studies at The Courtauld Institute of Art in London and always remained, especially through his service on the AFCIA Board, a stalwart supporter of the Institute's varied educational programs. It was thanks to Dr. Liedtke's immense prestige and wise counsel that AFCIA fulfilled its mission--a task that will now be far more arduous without him. On behalf of the AFCIA Board, its President and Executive Director wish, in this sad moment, to express with great sincerity their deepest condolences to his widow, Mrs. Nancy Liedtke. 1/3"

2015-02-06T00:00:00Z,"VAN BUREN--Barbara. Born in Brooklyn, August 28, 1929, died in her Manhattan home on January 31, 2015. Educated in Catholic schools, she further received a BS degree from Queens College, and a MS in Social Work from Columbia University. A Social Worker for many years, she championed the rights of children, incarcerated women, and ex-offenders. Many social programs throughout New York City benefit today from Barbara's relentless efforts and skillful fundraising. She retired in 2011 at the age of 82 from West Side Federation for Senior Housing and Support Services (WSFSSH) after twenty-one years as the Director of Development. Barbara had a progressive spirit and was particularly talented at organization, preparation and inclusiveness, tempered by spontaneity and a zeal for having fun. Barbara's talents shone in her position as Director of Community Liaison in the Office of the New York City Council President (1977-1979). They also led to her successes in acquiring funding and grants for many service agencies: Project Green Hope (1980-1986) and the Fortune Society (1980-1986) as Development Director and Grants Administrator, both supportive services for ex-prisoners, male and female; the AIDS Services Delivery Consortium as Director (1987); and West Side Federation for Senior Housing and Support Services (WSFSSH), as Directory of Development (1980-2011). Up until her last illness, Barbara for many years co-chaired the Community Board Number Seven, Committee for Health and Human Services. Barbara was deeply religious, and viewed her faith as including social and community responsibility. Her staunch beliefs, and extraordinary talents in organizing social movements propelled her into leadership roles in progressive activities such as Call to Action. As a progressive she had a keen interest in feminist initiatives. Barbara loved New York City and all it offers. Barbara frequently traveled with friends. She was fun to be with and to go out with. She will be greatly missed. Barbara is survived by her brother Jerome, her sister-in-law Mary; niece Michele Van Buren Kiefer; nephews David Van Buren and Christopher Van Holmes; grand-nieces Jean Van Buren, Skye Terebey, Carlin Van Holmes, Madison Van Holmes and Aurora Kiefer; and grand-nephew Edward Kiefer. Calling hours at Reddens Funeral Home, 325 W. 14 St., Sunday February. 8, 3- 5pm and 7-9pm. Funeral Mass at St. Gregory Church, 144 W. 90 St., at 10am on Monday, February 9.

He was 66. He retired in 2013 as vice chairman of Marsh & McLennan Companies, and was the founder and, for 25 years, the Chairman and CEO of Delta Consulting Group, one of the countrys elite boutique management consulting firms. The son of Leonard and Zeace Nadler of White Plains, he was born in New York, lived in Japan and Ethiopia where his father was on assignment for the U.S. Agency for International Development, and attended high school in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C.

In 1980, after two years on the faculty of the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University, David launched Delta Consulting Group, whose talented professionals pioneered the practice of organizational change. Over time, David became widely known as a thought leader and respected advisor to CEOs and corporate boards on governance, leadership, organization design and senior teams. He authored and/or edited 16 books and contributed scores of articles and chapters in professional publications. He continued working with clients and managing the firm after he sold Delta to Marsh & McLennan in 2000, eventually becoming vice chairman of the parent company in 2006.

2015-02-08T00:00:00Z,"LIEDTKE--Walter. The Board of the American Friends of the Mauritshuis is saddened to announce the tragic passing of one of their own. Walter A. Liedtke was the Curator of European Paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for 35 years. He was one of the six people who died in the train wreck on February 3, 2015, in Valhalla, NY. Walter was a highly esteemed authority on Dutch and Flemish art, who published prodigiously, organized major exhibitions and lectured widely. He was an authority on Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Delft architectural painting and wrote both the Flemish (1984) and Dutch (2007) catalogues of the Metropolitan. Proof of the wide range of his interests, he also was working on the catalogue of Spanish paintings at his death. Educated at Rutgers and Brown, he received his PhD from the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, in 1974. He taught at Ohio State University for four years before joining the Metropolitan's curatorial staff. Among the outstanding shows that he organized in New York were ""Vermeer and the Delft School"" (2001), ""Rembrandt/Not Rembrandt"" in the Metropolitan Museum (1995), and ""Liechtenstein: The Princely Collections"" (1985). His books include, ""Architectural Painting in Delft: Gerard Houckgeest, Hendrick van Vliet, Emanuel de Witte"" (1982), ""The Royal Horse and Rider: Painting, Sculpture and Horsemanship 1500-1800"" (1989), ""Flemish Paintings in America"" (1992), ""A View of Delft: Vermeer and his Contemporaries"" (2000), and ""Vermeer. The Complete Paintings"" (2008). He wrote more than one hundred articles and reviews and was the recipient of many awards, honors and grants. On a personal note, Walter was a witty man, who enjoyed the thrust and parry of debate and scholarly jousting. He held and voiced strong opinions and was always impeccably dressed. Walter scarcely seemed to age. He leaves his lovely wife, Nancy, who taught mathematics and shared his passion for raising horses on their farm in Bedford Hills. Walter will be sorely missed. We have lost a very good and learned friend. Peter C. Sutton 1/3"

Fordham University and its Board of Trustees mourns the loss of Ann Mara, matriarch of the New York Giants football dynasty, ""first lady of football,"" and longtime friend and supporter of Fordham. ""We have lost a great woman today, a woman of many talents, and a great soul,"" said Joseph M. McShane, S.J., president of Fordham. ""She was indeed the first lady of Fordham football, but she was so much more than that: a keen businesswoman; a devout Catholic; a loving mother; a generous philanthropist; and a warm colleague. I know the Fordham community joins me today in mourning her loss, and in keeping the Mara family in our thoughts and prayers."" Mrs. Mara is the widow of longtime Giants owner Wellington Mara, a 1937 graduate of Fordham College at Rose Hill. She was awarded an honorary degree from Fordham in 2008, and in 2012 received Fordham's Walsh Award, given each year to an individual who best exemplifies the support, loyalty, and passion for Fordham football. Mrs. Mara's connection to Fordham football dates back to the 1930s, when her future husband, Wellington, a classmate of Vince Lombardi, would bring her to University sporting events. The Mara family has multiple ties to the University: John Mara, the Giants' president and CEO, is a 1979 graduate of Fordham Law School and several of Ann's Mara's grandchildren attended the University. Wellington and John Mara are also recipients of honorary degrees from Fordham, and Wellington Mara received one of the University's first Founder's Awards. ""During our courtship, [Wellington] dragged me to every football game and every basketball game,"" Mrs. Mara said when she accepted the Walsh Award. ""That was his idea of a romantic night."" In conferring an honorary doctorate of humane letters upon her in 2008, Fordham said of Mrs. Mara, ""She is the matriarch; literally as a mother, grandmother, and great- grandmother, and figuratively, for the extended New York Giants family, a family that includes scores of players and hundreds of Giants alumni. Indeed, through it all: the defeats, the personal losses and the memorable triumphs, Ann Mumm Mara has been there."" 1/3"

She was the youngest of four children born to Herman and Fannie Peck Hardis and is predeceased by her two brothers, Abraham and Leonard, and her sister, Ruth. A beloved mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, she lived an extraordinary life. She was born in the Bronx, New York, where she graduated from high school and then attended Hunter College. When she married the love of her life, Milton Kornbluth, in 1940, she moved to Paterson, New Jersey, where she lived for fifty- nine years. One of her great passions was singing in the Temple Emanuel choir with Milton. Her enthusiasm for art was boundless. Lillian had been a housewife with three teenagers when she started a fine art gallery in her home. A few years later, she moved the gallery to a storefront in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, where she exhibited such important contemporary artists as Pablo Picasso, Milton Avery, Will Barnet, Wolf Kahn, Louis Kosowick, Dale Chihuly, Paul Resika, and Richard Segalman. She had a gift for discovering young artists to whom she gave the opportunity to develop and show their work. Those who enjoyed her gallery openings remember them as special occasions often followed by dinners in the Kornbluth's home, where relationships were formed that blossomed into lifelong friendships for artists and clients. In 1990, Lillian sold her gallery to her manager, Sally Walker, but stayed involved as a consultant to the gallery for the next nine years. Lillian moved with Milton to Marina Del Rey, California, in 1999. She was kind and generous to all who knew her. When her youngest son, Peter, was a teenager, the Kornbluth home was the social meeting place for Peter's friends. A house key was always kept under the front entrance door mat, and it was not uncommon for Lillian to come home from the gallery to find a group of Peter's friends relaxing in the family den, not always with Peter present. She always made them welcome. Lillian was predeceased by her husband, Milton, who died in 1999. Lillian is survived by her adored children, Richard and Ann Kornbluth of Syracuse, New York, Peter and Story Kornbluth of Santa Barbara, California, and Janet and Eddie Tucker of Joshua Tree, California. She will be missed by her precious grandchildren Rebecca Kornbluth of Temecula, California, Jeremy Kornbluth and Catherine Delorenzo of Rockville, Maryland, Day Kornbluth and Max Pittman of Brooklyn, New York, and Natalie Kornbluth of San Francisco, California; and her great- grandchildren, Arthur and Louisa Pittman of Brooklyn, New York, and Eli Kornbluth of Rockville, Maryland. 1/3"

Educated in Catholic schools, she further received a BS degree from Queens College, and a MS in Social Work from Columbia University. A Social Worker for many years, she championed the rights of children, incarcerated women, and ex-offenders. Many social programs throughout New York City benefit today from Barbara's relentless efforts and skillful fundraising. She retired in 2011 at the age of 82 from West Side Federation for Senior Housing and Support Services (WSFSSH) after twenty-one years as the Director of Development. Barbara had a progressive spirit and was particularly talented at organization, preparation and inclusiveness, tempered by spontaneity and a zeal for having fun. Barbara's talents shone in her position as Director of Community Liaison in the Office of the New York City Council President (1977-1979). They also led to her successes in acquiring funding and grants for many service agencies: Project Green Hope (1980-1986) and the Fortune Society (1980-1986) as Development Director and Grants Administrator, both supportive services for ex-prisoners, male and female; the AIDS Services Delivery Consortium as Director (1987); and West Side Federation for Senior Housing and Support Services (WSFSSH), as Directory of Development (1980-2011). Up until her last illness, Barbara for many years co-chaired the Community Board Number Seven, Committee for Health and Human Services. Barbara was deeply religious, and viewed her faith as including social and community responsibility. Her staunch beliefs, and extraordinary talents in organizing social movements propelled her into leadership roles in progressive activities such as Call to Action. As a progressive she had a keen interest in feminist initiatives. Barbara loved New York City and all it offers. Barbara frequently traveled with friends. She was fun to be with and to go out with. She will be greatly missed. Barbara is survived by her brother Jerome, her sister-in-law Mary; niece Michele Van Buren Kiefer; nephews David Van Buren and Christopher Van Holmes; grand-nieces Jean Van Buren, Skye Terebey, Carlin Van Holmes, Madison Van Holmes and Aurora Kiefer; and grand-nephew Edward Kiefer.

A crew of cherubic, messy-haired toddlers in fantastically stylish outfits bounces through this simple rhyming celebration of love in its many forms. On each page, the word “love” is paired with just one other (“me,” “you,” “smile,” “hug”) as we see Massini’s characters at the beach and at the playground, with a dog and a cat, and reading, painting and playing instruments. A teddy’s lost, then found, adding a dose of drama to a gorgeous and altogether satisfying little world."

2015-02-08T00:00:00Z,"SOREL--Nancy Caldwell, died on February 5th at the age of 80. The cause of death was Lewy Body Dementia. Nancy was the author of ""The Women Who Wrote The War"", which chronicled the lives and work of women war reporters during World War II. She also wrote ""Ever Since Eve: Personal Reflections of Childbirth"", and collaborated with her husband, the artist Edward Sorel, on two books: ""Word People and First Encounters."" Her essays appeared in Esquire, Atlantic Monthly, and The New York Times Book Review, and she was a staff editor of Columbia Encyclopedia, Third Edition. Nancy Lee Caldwell was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1934, the daughter of Dr. John and Ruth Conkling Caldwell. She graduated from Ohio Wesleyan in 1956 where she majored in English Literature. She continued to pursue her study of literature at the University of Edinburgh and later NYU. Nancy lived briefly in London where she was introduced to the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). In 1961 she volunteered for the United Nations Association International Service in Linz, Austria, building homes for WWII refugees, still stateless sixteen years after the end of WWII. Nancy and Edward Sorel met in 1963 at Morningside Friends Meeting, which they later joined and where they were married in 1965. They became active in the anti-Vietnam war movement. In 1967, carrying their infant daughter Jenny, they participated in the (illegal) Easter Sunday pilgrimage across the Peace Bridge to Canada to deliver medical supplies destined for both North and South Vietnam. Nancy felt at home in the country. Having moved to Putnam County, she cherished the time spent in nature with her children and Newfoundland. A music lover, she was instrumental in starting the Putnam Concert Society. The family joined Bulls Head Quaker Meeting, and Nancy participated in a worship group at Green Haven Correctional Facility. She was active in New York Yearly Meeting, serving on numerous committees and acting as recording clerk for multiple terms. She contributed to writing and editing a book on the 300-year history of Quakers in New York State, and she briefly served on the board of the American Friends Service Committee. Nancy lived the last 33 years of her life primarily in New York City where she relished doing research at the Morgan and New York Public Libraries and writing at one end of their TriBeCa loft while Ed drew at the other. In addition to her husband, Edward, she is survived by her sisters, Suzanne Smith and Virginia Craig, both of Kansas; her beloved children and step-children, Jenny Sorel, Katherine Sorel, Madeline Sorel Kahn and Leo Sorel; and her six grandchildren, Saskia, Sabella, Walter, Adam, Dulio and Thelonious, whom she adored. Nancy emanated kindness, generosity and warmth. Even as the disease progressed, her grace and spirit prevailed. All who knew Nancy felt themselves fortunate. 1/3"

2015-02-09T00:00:00Z,"WHITEHEAD--John C. The Rockefeller University community mourns the loss of our beloved friend John C. Whitehead, a cherished and highly esteemed member of our Board of Trustees. The world has lost one of the great public servants and business leaders of our time. As a boy, John was an Eagle Scout, and he never lost his passion for service. Throughout his life, John personified the attributes of the Greatest Generation, from his heroic D-day landing on Omaha Beach to assuming the chairmanship of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, charged with the massive challenge of rebuilding Ground Zero. We feel so blessed that John was a trustee of The Rockefeller University from 1989 until his death. He was a significant agent for change at Rockefeller, and his trusteeship had a transformative effect on the institution. As Chairman of the Board's Development Committee in the 1990s, he helped to elevate private support for the University to extraordinary new levels. When John sought support for an institution or a cause he loved, no one ever wanted to disappoint him. In 1998, John was the recipient of the David Rockefeller Award for Extraordinary Service, Rockefeller University's highest non- scientific honor, in recognition of his brilliant leadership, his integrity, and his legendary generosity. In 2009, the University established the John C. Whitehead Presidential Fellowships to further recognize John's myriad contributions to Rockefeller's scientific excellence and to honor him more broadly for his distinguished pro bono work for a wide range of other institutions. John Whitehead was a statesman in the worlds of business, international affairs, and philanthropy. Above all, he was determined to make a contribution to society. In this he succeeded, perhaps beyond his wildest dreams. John will be tremendously missed by the entire Rockefeller University community. We send our heartfelt condolences to John's adored wife, Cynthia; his children and stepchildren; and his entire family. ""His life was gentle, and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world, 'This was a man'.""

2015-02-10T00:00:00Z,"WHITEHEAD--John C. The Rockefeller University community mourns the loss of our beloved friend John C. Whitehead, a cherished and highly esteemed member of our Board of Trustees. The world has lost one of the great public servants and business leaders of our time. As a boy, John was an Eagle Scout, and he never lost his passion for service. Throughout his life, John personified the attributes of the Greatest Generation, from his heroic D-day landing on Omaha Beach to assuming the chairmanship of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, charged with the massive challenge of rebuilding Ground Zero. We feel so blessed that John was a trustee of The Rockefeller University from 1989 until his death. He was a significant agent for change at Rockefeller, and his trusteeship had a transformative effect on the institution. As Chairman of the Board's Development Committee in the 1990s, he helped to elevate private support for the University to extraordinary new levels. When John sought support for an institution or a cause he loved, no one ever wanted to disappoint him. In 1998, John was the recipient of the David Rockefeller Award for Extraordinary Service, Rockefeller University's highest non- scientific honor, in recognition of his brilliant leadership, his integrity, and his legendary generosity. In 2009, the University established the John C. Whitehead Presidential Fellowships to further recognize John's myriad contributions to Rockefeller's scientific excellence and to honor him more broadly for his distinguished pro bono work for a wide range of other institutions. John Whitehead was a statesman in the worlds of business, international affairs, and philanthropy. Above all, he was determined to make a contribution to society. In this he succeeded, perhaps beyond his wildest dreams. John will be tremendously missed by the entire Rockefeller University community. We send our heartfelt condolences to John's adored wife, Cynthia; his children and stepchildren; and his entire family. ""His life was gentle, and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world, 'This was a man'.""

Donna MacNeil (1935-2015) died peacefully in the Visiting Nurse Service of New York Hospice Haven at Bellevue Hospital on February 7, 2015 after a long struggle with lung disease and breast cancer. She was 79 and had lived a varied and colorful life--as a fashion designer's model, avid reader, traveler, photographer, sailor, ballet enthusiast--and adored friend of many for her delicious wit and sweet disposition. She was born in Newark, NJ to Lucille Stagg, a nurse, and Pasquale (Pat) Nappi M.D., a gynecologist. He gave up his practice to serve as an Army doctor during World War 2, the family traveling to a series of military base towns, such as Enterprise, Alabama. Donna often attended several different schools in a year. After the war she attended Prospect Hill Country Day school in Newark, then studied for two years at Skidmore in Saratoga Springs, NY, before transferring to New York University. Graduating in 1956, Donna was accepted in the NYU PhD program in psychology but chose to work to help her first husband, David Powell, study to become a psychiatrist. Donna worked as a model for Monte Sano & Pruzan couturiers. A brief marriage to Thomas McGinley, a Wall Street institutional investor ended when he died in a car accident in Ireland. Donna then joined the Dior-trained French fashion designer, Jacques Tiffeau, winner of Coty Awards in 1960 and 1964. A ""perfect six"" size, Donna was first his design model, then general assistant. Later, she married Joseph Richards, who worked on the business side of The New Yorker, traveling extensively with him in Europe and Asia. After their divorce in 1984, she married Robert MacNeil, then co- anchor of The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour on PBS. A keen sailor from childhood, Donna cruised with him up the New England coast and bare-boated in the Caribbean. She also spent several years working as manager of Superlearning, a company selling materials to stimulate the mental states that enhance learning. She survived breast cancer in 2007 but was diagnosed afresh in 2013. She was also hospitalized four times for pneumonia. Donna is survived and mourned by her husband, known to friends as ""Robin""; her sister, Carol Wenzel of Millville NJ; her niece Meg O'Callaghan of Rye NY; and her nephew, Gregory Wenzel of Ithaca, NY.

2015-02-11T00:00:00Z,"MacNEIL--Donna P. Donna MacNeil (1935-2015) died peacefully in the Visiting Nurse Service of New York Hospice Haven at Bellevue Hospital on February 7, 2015 after a long struggle with lung disease and breast cancer. She was 79 and had lived a varied and colorful life--as a fashion designer's model, avid reader, traveler, photographer, sailor, ballet enthusiast--and adored friend of many for her delicious wit and sweet disposition. She was born in Newark, NJ to Lucille Stagg, a nurse, and Pasquale (Pat) Nappi M.D., a gynecologist. He gave up his practice to serve as an Army doctor during World War 2, the family traveling to a series of military base towns, such as Enterprise, Alabama. Donna often attended several different schools in a year. After the war she attended Prospect Hill Country Day school in Newark, then studied for two years at Skidmore in Saratoga Springs, NY, before transferring to New York University. Graduating in 1956, Donna was accepted in the NYU PhD program in psychology but chose to work to help her first husband, David Powell, study to become a psychiatrist. Donna worked as a model for Monte Sano & Pruzan couturiers. A brief marriage to Thomas McGinley, a Wall Street institutional investor ended when he died in a car accident in Ireland. Donna then joined the Dior-trained French fashion designer, Jacques Tiffeau, winner of Coty Awards in 1960 and 1964. A ""perfect six"" size, Donna was first his design model, then general assistant. Later, she married Joseph Richards, who worked on the business side of The New Yorker, traveling extensively with him in Europe and Asia. After their divorce in 1984, she married Robert MacNeil, then co- anchor of The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour on PBS. A keen sailor from childhood, Donna cruised with him up the New England coast and bare-boated in the Caribbean. She also spent several years working as manager of Superlearning, a company selling materials to stimulate the mental states that enhance learning. She survived breast cancer in 2007 but was diagnosed afresh in 2013. She was also hospitalized four times for pneumonia. Donna is survived and mourned by her husband, known to friends as ""Robin""; her sister, Carol Wenzel of Millville NJ; her niece Meg O'Callaghan of Rye NY; and her nephew, Gregory Wenzel of Ithaca, NY. A memorial service will be held at a later time. 1/3"

2015-02-12T00:00:00Z,"FOLEY--Adrian M. ""Bud,"" Jr.,one of New Jersey's leading lawyers for six decades, died at home in Essex Fells surrounded by his family on February 9, 2015, three weeks after his 93rd birthday. Born on a farm in Bartlett, North Dakota, he moved as a child to New Jersey where he attended his beloved St. Benedict's Prep in Newark, went on to graduate cum laude from Seton Hall University, and after the war received his law degree from Columbia University. A decorated veteran of World War II he was a B-24 navigator in the United States Army Air Corps who flew missions over the Mediterranean, Baltic and European theaters. He was awarded the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the Presidential Unit Citation with two oak leaf clusters, and five battle stars. Bud married his college sweetheart Mary Malone in 1945 and until her death in 2005 they were inseparable. Friends fondly referred to the dynamic couple by one name: ""BudandMary."" Adrian Foley lived a life of remarkable accomplishment without sacrificing his firmly held religious beliefs or the ethical responsibilities of his legal profession. With his extraordinary power of persuasion, combined with his wise vision, his life defined the concept of thoughtful leadership. He was a man of warmth and grace who could never say no to any call for help without hesitation. Bud's brand of storytelling was always a source of delight, especially to his grandchildren. Self-deprecation was a favorite theme. About himself he would say: ""Frequently in error; never in doubt!"" Writing in a New York Times article Richard Reeves called Adrian Foley one of the 15 most powerful men in New Jersey, ""one who generally turns up on one side or the other in all major legal disputes affecting New Jersey."" A New Jersey Monthly article called him ""probably the most powerful lawyer in New Jersey."" He coyly referred to both of these pieces as works of fanciful fiction. Adrian represented everything that was good in public life. Active in all facets of the Bar he was the youngest President of the New Jersey Bar Association, and the youngest elected Surrogate in the State of New Jersey. He served for many years as the state delegate to the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association and was elected to the ABA's Board of Governors. He was the tenth chair of the Litigation Section of the ABA and chaired many ABA committees including the first to permit lawyer advertising. He served as a Director of the American Judicature Society and was a permanent delegate to the Third Circuit Judicial Conference. He was also a fellow of the American College of Trial Attorneys and a Fellow of the American College of Estate and Trust Counsel. He was honored by the New Jersey Commission on Excellence in Law with the Justice Daniel O'Hern Award in recognition of his commitment to professionalism and his outstanding career and achievement in service to the Bar. Governor Richard J. Hughes appointed Adrian to preside as President of the New Jersey Constitutional Convention in 1966. Governor William Cahill appointed him the first treasurer and chief financial officer of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. Governor Brendan Byrne reappointed him to that position. Together with Sports Authority Chairman Sonny Werblin, he was instrumental in devising a bond issue that generated the funds for construction of Giants Stadium and the Meadowlands Race Track. This was no small feat, given the fierce political opposition from New York City and State officials that fought to keep the Giants from moving across the Hudson River. Adrian also served on the Board of Overseers of Seton Hall University's Immaculate Conception Seminary for over a decade. He was a Member of the Board of Visitors of Columbia University Law School and a Trustee of Seton Hall University. He was the first recipient of the All University Award granted by Seton Hall and the first recipient of the Saint Benedict's Prep Medal and also elected to St. Benedict's Athletic Hall of Fame. He received an honorary PhD degree from St. Peter's College. He was a Knight of Malta and received a Medal of Service from the Archdiocese of Newark for whom he served as legal counsel for many years. He was a lector, Eucharistic Minister and daily communicant at Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament Church in Roseland. He was also a member of the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance Company for many years where he chaired the Finance Committee. In addition to his professional and social service, Bud was the past president of the New Jersey State Golf Association and a Trustee of the Essex Fells Country Club where he was a member for 57 years. He was also a member of the Skeeters Club in New York City. Adrian Foley was a partner in the Connell Foley law firm for 56 years. His knowledge, counsel and humor will be sorely missed by his lifelong friends and colleagues at the Firm, his second family. He is survived by his devoted children Adrian M. Foley III (Lindy) of Duncan, S.C, Dianne Foley of Shaker Heights, OH, Corinne Errico (Robert) of Short Hills, and Christopher Foley (Jenny) of Apharetta, GA; by his 13 cherished grandchildren; and by his 10 loving great-grandchildren. Relatives and friends are invited for visiting hours on Friday, February 13th at Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament Church, 28 Livingston Avenue, Roseland, NJ from 3:00pm to 9:00pm. Funeral Mass will be celebrated on Saturday February 14th, 10:00am in the church with entombment to follow at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in East Hanover. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in his memory to Saint Benedict's Preparatory School, 520 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Newark, NJ 07102. www.sbp.org."

He was 79 years old. The youngest of three brothers, Allan was born on July 18th 1935 in Indianapolis, Indiana. He attended Catholic High Schools in Cleveland and Chicago as well as Indianapolis and graduated with honors in 1957 from the University of Notre Dame where he majored in English and Speech.

2015-02-12T00:00:00Z,"FLUG--Martin Raphael, beloved father, grandfather, son, brother and husband, and an entrepreneur and business leader in New York and Colorado since the early 1960s. Died at home in Aspen, Colo., on February 10, 2015. Son of the late Samuel S. Flug and the late Evelyn R. Flug of Brooklyn, NY. Born January 6, 1931, in Brooklyn. He graduated from Harvard College (1952), Yale Law School (1955), and Harvard Business School (1957). A winter visitor to Aspen since 1963, he has lived there since 1979. He was the husband of Sarah Kennedy Flug; the father of Jeremy J. Flug of Denver and Eliza Flug of Seattle; grandfather of Matthew, William, Benjamin and Henry Flug of Denver and Lauren Coburn of Seattle; father-in-law of Angela Murray Flug of Denver; and brother of James F. Flug of Washington DC, Barbara Flug Colin of Roslyn Estates, N.Y., the late Robert K. Flug of Portland, Ore., and Victoria Flug Sterling of Denver. At his death he was co-chairman of the Board of Gulftech International, Inc., of Aspen, a group of five companies that design, manufacture and lease food-processing equipment. A natural entrepreneur, he often told the story of his first serious business venture, when, on his way to enroll in Harvard, he got sidetracked and used his tuition money to buy the first Boston dealership for the then unheard-of Vespa Motor Scooter. The business was a great success, as he foresaw (and he still enrolled in Harvard that semester on a scholarship). The energy and vision and restless intelligence he showed in his business ventures also extended to his varied civic, charitable and educational activities, including Trustee of the Aspen Center for Physics, Life Trustee of the Aspen Music Festival and School, Benefactor of the Martin R. Flug Professorship of International Law, the Ernest Rubenstein Scholarship and the Samuel S. Flug Memorial Scholarship, all at Yale Law School, and of the Samuel S. and Evelyn R. Flug Scholarship Fund at Harvard College, Past Board Member and Officer of the Aspen Country Day School, Past Chairman of United Way of Rye, NY, Past President of Manursing Island Club, NY. In honor of his mother and his own dedication to childrens education, he founded and supported the Evelyn R. Flug Childrens Library in Aspen, and a private foundation to support experiments in education. But a simple--even if impressively lengthy--list of boards and titles does not capture his deep involvement and commitment to causes and activities he cared about. In Aspen, inspired by his early friendship with local newspaper publisher Bil Dunaway, Martin Flug reveled in mountain life with the same intensity he brought to all his endeavors. He bicycled all summer, including his iconic rides in Aspen's Fourth of July parades, dressed in an Uncle Sam suit. He skied with abandon every winter and was an early aficionado of uphill skiing, long before it enjoyed its current wave of popularity--skiing up Buttermilk and then descending with glee. His skiing adventures extended to heli-skiing in Canada, where (as he loved to tell the story) he once brought an end to a season-long snow drought by leading his skiing party in an American Indian rain chant. At home in Aspen, his hospitality extended to a lengthy list of artists and intellects, most especially the musicians of the Aspen Music Festival and physicists visiting the Aspen Center for Physics. 1/3"

2015-02-13T00:00:00Z,"GOLDSCHMID--Harvey J. Columbia Law School Prof. Harvey J. Goldschmid, a renowned corporate governance expert who served as a commissioner and the top attorney at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and played a key role in implementing one of the most sweeping federal securities laws in U.S. history, died on February 12. He was 74. A beloved professor and mentor to generations of Columbia law students, Goldschmid was a two-time recipient of the Willis L.M. Reese Prize for Excellence in Teaching. He described his classroom philosophy in a 2013 interview, explaining that the most important part of teaching was ""to think about not only what the law is, which students need to know, but what it ought to be."" Goldschmid was a dedicated public servant. He served as general counsel of the SEC from 1998 to 1999, as special senior adviser to then Chairman Arthur Levitt in 2000, and as an influential commissioner for the agency from 2002 to 2005. ""Very rarely in life do you meet a scholar and government official who both makes great contributions to public policy and is a good man. In my lifetime, I have never met one who was the equal of Harvey J. Goldschmid,"" Joel Seligman wrote in Columbia Law Review. Goldschmid's term began just after the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a law that aimed to improve the quality of corporate financial reporting. He served during some of the most tumultuous times in the agency's history, as regulators and legislators called for stricter controls for public companies. He was a strong advocate for shareholders and defended the agencys efforts to curtail corporate fraud. ""As a sometime historian of the Commission,"" Seligman wrote, ""I am confident that he has become the most influential SEC Commissioner who did not become a Chair in the agency's history. Since this is an agency that has been blessed with extraordinary Commissioners, I mean this encomium as the highest possible praise."" A New York native, Goldschmid was born into a working-class family in the Bronx in 1940. In moving testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs during his confirmation process in 2002, Goldschmid spoke about his family and their influence on him. ""My parents believed in our financial markets, and, because of Social Security and their investments, retired to a relatively comfortable life in Florida,"" he said. ""Our nation, as this Committee has indicated, is now witnessing the most dramatic business scandals that have occurred during my professional life. On a very personal level, I feel the pain of the retirees and the investors whose futures have been jeopardized."" After his service at the agency, Goldschmid remained an influential voice in economic policy. After the financial collapse of 2008, he advocated strongly for the creation of a systemic risk agency. In 2012, he was named to the resulting Systemic Risk Council. Goldschmid, served as counsel to Weil, Gotshal &Manges until his death. He was a prolific writer in the fields of corporate, securities, and antitrust law. He also served as a consultant on antitrust policy to the FTC, a member of its Task Force on High Tech/Innovation Issues, a public governor and chair of the Regulatory Policy Committee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a trustee of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, a director of the National Center on Philanthropy and the Law, a director of Transparency International-USA, and as a vice chair of the Center for Audit Quality. Goldschmid was a magna cum laude graduate of both Columbia College and Columbia Law School. After law school, he clerked for Judge Paul Hays of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit and then practiced law at Debevoise & Plimpton. He joined the Columbia Law Faculty in 1970. He is survived by his wife Mary and his three children, Charles, Paul, and Joseph, each of whom earned a J.D. degree at Columbia Law School. Funeral services will be held privately. A memorial service is planned at Columbia Law School. Donations in his memory are being directed to the Columbia Law School Annual Fund. Our hearts are heavy with the weight of this great loss."

2015-02-13T00:00:00Z,"FLUG--Martin Raphael, beloved father, grandfather, son, brother and husband, and an entrepreneur and business leader in New York and Colorado since the early 1960s. Died at home in Aspen, Colo., on February 10, 2015. Son of the late Samuel S. Flug and the late Evelyn R. Flug of Brooklyn, NY. Born January 6, 1931, in Brooklyn. He graduated from Harvard College (1952), Yale Law School (1955), and Harvard Business School (1957). A winter visitor to Aspen since 1963, he has lived there since 1979. He was the husband of Sarah Kennedy Flug; the father of Jeremy J. Flug of Denver and Eliza Flug of Seattle; grandfather of Matthew, William, Benjamin and Henry Flug of Denver and Lauren Coburn of Seattle; father-in-law of Angela Murray Flug of Denver; and brother of James F. Flug of Washington DC, Barbara Flug Colin of Roslyn Estates, N.Y., the late Robert K. Flug of Portland, Ore., and Victoria Flug Sterling of Denver. At his death he was co-chairman of the Board of Gulftech International, Inc., of Aspen, a group of five companies that design, manufacture and lease food-processing equipment. A natural entrepreneur, he often told the story of his first serious business venture, when, on his way to enroll in Harvard, he got sidetracked and used his tuition money to buy the first Boston dealership for the then unheard-of Vespa Motor Scooter. The business was a great success, as he foresaw (and he still enrolled in Harvard that semester on a scholarship). The energy and vision and restless intelligence he showed in his business ventures also extended to his varied civic, charitable and educational activities, including Trustee of the Aspen Center for Physics, Life Trustee of the Aspen Music Festival and School, Benefactor of the Martin R. Flug Professorship of International Law, the Ernest Rubenstein Scholarship and the Samuel S. Flug Memorial Scholarship, all at Yale Law School, and of the Samuel S. and Evelyn R. Flug Scholarship Fund at Harvard College, Past Board Member and Officer of the Aspen Country Day School, Past Chairman of United Way of Rye, NY, Past President of Manursing Island Club, NY. In honor of his mother and his own dedication to childrens education, he founded and supported the Evelyn R. Flug Childrens Library in Aspen, and a private foundation to support experiments in education. But a simple--even if impressively lengthy--list of boards and titles does not capture his deep involvement and commitment to causes and activities he cared about. In Aspen, inspired by his early friendship with local newspaper publisher Bil Dunaway, Martin Flug reveled in mountain life with the same intensity he brought to all his endeavors. He bicycled all summer, including his iconic rides in Aspen's Fourth of July parades, dressed in an Uncle Sam suit. He skied with abandon every winter and was an early aficionado of uphill skiing, long before it enjoyed its current wave of popularity--skiing up Buttermilk and then descending with glee. His skiing adventures extended to heli-skiing in Canada, where (as he loved to tell the story) he once brought an end to a season-long snow drought by leading his skiing party in an American Indian rain chant. At home in Aspen, his hospitality extended to a lengthy list of artists and intellects, most especially the musicians of the Aspen Music Festival and physicists visiting the Aspen Center for Physics. 1/3"

He leaves behind the love of his life, Marianna, with whom he shared 57 wonderful years; son Ron Dranetz (Linda) of Chester, NJ; daughter Karen Wolf (Barry) of New York City; four grandchildren, Staci Wolf, Jenna Wolf, Jennifer Dranetz and Alexander Dranetz; and a brother, Marshall Dranetz, of Bryan, TX.

2015-02-15T00:00:00Z,"CHRISTY--David Stewart, an economist and advisor to the Afghan resistance during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, died in his home in New York on February 7, 2015 at the age of 90. When the United States began to support the Afghan resistance in the 1980s, aid was dispensed on the condition that no serving U.S. intelligence officer enter Afghanistan. Retired from government service and uncompensated by the U.S. government, Mr. Christy was at liberty to travel to Afghanistan with mujahidin groups, advising them and analyzing their viability. Along with Dr. Qudrat Mojadidi, an Afghan-American doctor, he helped establish and fund an OBGYN clinic for Afghan refugees in Peshawar, Pakistan. The hospital was sponsored, in part, by the International Rescue Committee of New York. Mr. Christy accompanied Professor Sigbutullah Mojadidi to Kabul when he returned as the president of Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989. Mr. Christy was born on February 20, 1924, in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, the son of Dr. Joseph Augustus Christy and Flora Stewart. He was still a naval cadet, in training to be a pilot, when his class was dissolved at the end of WWII. Because of his ranking in class, Christy was given the opportunity to continue flight training on a non-reserve status with a further commitment to spend six additional years in the Navy Air Corps. When he declined, he was shifted as a commissioned officer to the Office of Naval Intelligence and placed on reserve status. He graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in chemical engineering in 1946. Mr. Christy was a lifelong student of philosophy and religion. His first exposure to the Muslim world was in 1947, while attending the speech of the first sultan of Morocco. This modest initial contact was the seed of a lifetime of casual study of Islamic culture. As a partial result, over the last six decades, Christy immersed himself in the cultures of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. His work as an economist-entrepreneur took him to the Far East, as well as to countries such as Nigeria, Cameroun, Ghana, Egypt, and Sudan, where he established joint ventures with governments of newly independent nations. Christy was on the Advisory Committee of China Institute in America. He served on the vestry of St. James' Episcopal Church and was a church school teacher, a Stephen Minister, and a Lay Eucharist Minister there. At the age of 84, he completed the Shikoku 88-Temple Pilgrimage, honoring the 9th century Buddhist teacher Kukai, by circumambulating the Japanese island of Shikoku. He is survived by Anita Christy, his wife of forty years; three children by his first marriage--Lee Dahlberg, Joseph Stewart Christy, and Susan Christy--and two children by his second marriage--David Stewart Christy, Jr. and Sarah Alden Christy; two former stepchildren, Arthur O. Sulzberger, Jr. and Karen Alden Sulzberger; five grandchildren; and seven godchildren. His foster son Amon Nassimi, an interpreter for the US State Department in Afghanistan, was killed by a Taliban car bombing in 2013. The funeral will be at St. James' Episcopal Church, 865 Madison Avenue. In lieu of flowers, please make donations to the International Rescue Committee,122 East 42nd Street, New York, NY 10168, 212- 551-3000, or +1-855-9RESCUE or St. James' Episcopal Church. 1/3"

2015-02-16T00:00:00Z,"DRANETZ--Abraham, of Scotch Plains, NJ, formerly of Osterville, MA, passed away February 12, 2015 at the age of 92. Beloved husband, devoted father, proud grandfather, loyal brother, and cherished friend, Abe was born in Brockton, MA, and raised in Hyannis, MA. He graduated magna cum laude from Tufts University in 1944, receiving a Bachelors degree in electrical engineering, and after serving two years in the United States Army, received a Masters degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1948. After graduating, Abe joined Gulton Industries in New Jersey, where he quickly rose through the ranks from Research Engineer, to Chief Engineer, to Director of Engineering, and ultimately, Vice President of Gulton. In 1962, Abe left Gulton, founding his brainchild, Dranetz Technologies, Inc., for which he served as President and Chairman. Dranetz produced sonar testing equipment and power line disturbance analyzers, which set the international benchmark for precision testing equipment. Under Abe's leadership, the company won several E-Star awards from the U.S. Department of Commerce, was repeatedly included in INC Magazines list of fastest growing small companies, and on numerous occasions, was included in Forbes Magazines list of ""Up and Comers."" In 1999, he was honored as an ""Engineering Hero"" by the New Jersey Society of Professional Engineers. In addition to his career with Dranetz Technologies, Abe authored numerous articles, contributed to several books, was awarded a number of patents, and served on numerous boards and councils. He proudly served his alma mater, as a member of the Board of Overseers at Tufts Universitys College of Engineering, and was also a member of Tau Beta Pi, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, in addition to several other societies. As a child of the Depression, Abe was particularly sensitive to the needs of others, and gave generously, yet humbly, of himself to numerous causes and institutions. He was a steadfast supporter of significant initiatives at both Tufts and MIT, in addition to many other educational, medical and civic organizations. Yet Abe's proudest achievement, and greatest joy, was his family, to whom he was wholly devoted. He leaves behind the love of his life, Marianna, with whom he shared 57 wonderful years; son Ron Dranetz (Linda) of Chester, NJ; daughter Karen Wolf (Barry) of New York City; four grandchildren, Staci Wolf, Jenna Wolf, Jennifer Dranetz and Alexander Dranetz; and a brother, Marshall Dranetz, of Bryan, TX.

He pioneered a new model of medical education as the founding Dean of McMaster University Medical School in 1965. He served as President of the University of Toronto from 1972-1978.

His advanced sympathy with modernism's restraint, formality, and openness with materials focused his individual sensitivities into decades of hand-made collages, plastic sculptures, watercolors, and unique etchings. Light-- and shadow--were constant attendants. An independent in his work, he was fully engaged with the art and social issues of his times. He served as President of the American Abstract Artists often during its early history and more recently on the New York City Art Commission. Leo and his extraordinary wife Dorothea were eminent collectors of American Folk Art: serious benefactors to this culture and to the museum that represents it, New York's Museum of American Folk Art. Their home/studio itself, with its sky-lit great hall, is a museum worthy of being landmarked. Leo came to New York as a young man from Cincinnati, where years of immersion in music and theatre helped form a character of great, insightful humanity. Dorothea came to New York after WWII from Berlin. Here she created a new life of immense intelligence, generosity--and humor. We friends hope that we can live up to the example of accomplishment, open-mindedness, and endless kindness that Leo and Dorothea showed us all, year after year, exhibition after exhibition, visit after visit. 1/3"

Buttrick, whose career spanned six decades, was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, a member of the Century Association and the Harvard Club, and an active participant in the life of the city. Born in 1931, Harry was the eldest of three children of Constance LaBoiteaux Drake and Charles Edgar Buttrick, and had five additional siblings. He grew up in Bryn Mawr, PA and Nantucket, MA. Prior to enrolling as an undergraduate at Harvard, he was awarded an English Speaking Union travelling scholarship in its inaugural class, and spent several months in England. In 1953 he started graduate work at Harvard's Graduate School of Design, and two years later, married his GSD classmate Ann Octavia White, a granddaughter of architect Stanford White. Buttrick established his first solo practice in New York City in 1961 and subsequently engaged in several partnerships, including Buttrick, White and Burtis. His built work includes the St. Thomas Choir School building, the Dana Center in Central Park at the Harlem Meer, a monastery in Nairobi, Kenya, many residences, offices, Tower Records stores, and projects for numerous private schools. He oversaw the rebuilding of the Pulitzer Fountain at Grand Army Plaza, and his most recent partnership, Murphy, Burnham and Buttrick, continues with the restoration of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Throughout his professional life, Harry influenced and encouraged many young designers. An avid reader, gardener, hiker and music lover, Harry resided in Manhattan and Lyme, CT. Buttrick is survived by his wife Ann, and their children John Buttrick, Jerome Buttrick, Mary Burnham, Sarah Buttrick and Catherine Leland, five brothers, and seven grandchildren. Harry was a much loved husband and father. He had many dear friends and will be remembered for his positive personality, clear intelligence, elegance and good cheer.

2015-02-18T00:00:00Z,"RABKIN--Leo. Abstract artist and folk art collector Leo Rabkin died peacefully at his Chelsea home on Sunday, February 15 at the age of 95. Rabkin created colorful painted sculptures inside new and antique boxes. Throughout his long career, he described his works as nugatory divigations, wanderings of the spirit having little or no tangible value. Working with commonplace things found on city streets, he was ahead of his time and of inspiration to younger artists. Born 1919 in Cincinnati, Ohio, Rabkin spent his early life studying the violin and as a boy usher for the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. Early exposure to the rigors of classical music helped him to ""think abstractly."" He was a member of the American Abstract Artists group for more than fifty years, serving as President from 1964-78. The group honored him with a tribute exhibition in the summer of 2014. He also served for many years on the Fine Arts Federation of New York. Leo Rabkin came to New York City in 1945 after service in World War II. He earned a master's in education and guidance counseling at New York University leading to a fifteen-year position at the Livingston School for Girls on King Street. His own experience with psychoanalysis deepened his understanding of art and led to studies with William Baziotes, Hale Woodruff and Robert Inglehart. He married Dorothea Herz (see NYT obit. December 5, 2008) in 1958 and the couple created a landmark collection of American folk art. The Rabkins donated many works to the American Folk Art Museum including the iconic whirligig sculpture of Uncle Sam riding a bicycle. The High Museum of Art in Atlanta also received historic folk art from the Rabkin Collection. In 2000, the couple created the Dorothea and Leo Rabkin Foundation to do charitable work in the arts community. He is survived by his nephew and nieces, Barry Blasberg, Gail Britt and Jill Blasberg Rosenstein, the children of his late sister, Emily Rabkin Blasberg. A memorial service will be held in the spring."

2015-02-18T00:00:00Z,"CHIRELSTEIN--Marvin A. Columbia Law School Professor Emeritus Marvin A. Chirelstein, a leading scholar of federal taxation, corporate law, and contracts whose textbooks are still used by students across the country, died on February 16. He was 86. Chirelstein first joined Columbia Law School in 1954 to work on the Federal Income Tax Project under Dean William C. Warren. He then joined the government as an attorney in the U.S. Department of the Treasury and later taught at Rutgers School of Law and Yale Law School. Chirelstein returned to Columbia Law School as a visiting professor in 1981 and became a full-time faculty member in 1984. Two years later, he was named the first Isidor and Seville Sulzbacher Professor of Law, an appointment announced by then-Columbia University President Michael I. Sovern. In addition to being a highly sought after academic expert on taxation, contracts, and corporate law, Chirelstein was a beloved professor who once taught a seminar on the legal side of one of his favorite sports: boxing. A music lover who played the violin, he was known for his dry sense of humor and quiet wit and was adored by students. Two of his textbooks, Concepts and Case Analysis in the Law of Contracts and Federal Income Taxation: A Law Students Guide to the Leading Cases and Concepts, have guided generations of future lawyers through the complexities of the law. A third, Cases and Materials on Corporate Finance, opened the way to interdisciplinary analysis of corporate law. Teaching was Chirelsteins passion, in addition to tax. Upon his appointment to the faculty in 1984, Chirelstein told the Columbia Law School News that he considered himself an educator at heart. As a professor at Yale Law School from 1965 to 1981, Chirelstein taught three future Columbia Law faculty colleagues: John C. Coffee Jr., Merritt B. Fox, and Ronald J. Gilson. He also taught future U.S. President Bill Clinton, who commented: ""I had the privilege of having Professor Chirelstein for both Tax Law and Corporate Finance at Yale--he was memorably patient with me in the former, and seemed pleased when I redeemed myself in the latter. He had a great sense of humor, forgiving me for reading One Hundred Years of Solitude in class and laughing at my answer when asked how I could be such a bad tax student and do so well in corporate finance: I said it was a lot like politics--someone's trying to gain at someone else's expense, and there have to be rules to avoid fraud and violence. It was the beginning of a long, if long distance, friendship. Professor Chirelstein, as I neared graduation, told me about a teaching vacancy at the University of Arkansas Law School in Fayetteville, and recommended me for a job that enriched and changed my life. I'll always be grateful for his gifted teaching, endless curiosity, and generous spirit."" For Prof. Fox, Chirelstein first kindled his interest in corporate finance. ""Students looked forward to going to Chirelsteins class every day, Fox said. He was remarkably incisive and sophisticated in his treatment of the issues, while at the same time being incredibly funny. It is a source of real pleasure that my son, Peter Fox 09, was able to have the same experience, taking tax with Chirelstein here at Columbia Law School. A trusted adviser, Chirelstein was often asked to provide commentary on taxation policies or reform efforts. In a 1994 Letter to the Editor published in The New York Times, Chirelstein supported President Clintons progressive taxation. . . . the distribution of national income has grown increasingly unequal over the last dozen years, at least in part as a consequence of the tax legislation that President Reagan put over on a gullible public, Chirelstein wrote in the Times. We are constantly told that American voters are disaffected, that they suffer from a political malaise, that they no longer trust their political leaders, and so on. Surely one reason is a growing sense that economic progress has been for the few. Progressive taxation won't solve the problem. But it helps, both actually and as a symbol of our national ideals. On Tax Day in 1998, Chirelstein appeared on PBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer to again defend the U.S. tax system despite its complexities, which he attributed to Congress trying to administer too many programs through the tax code. We collect a trillion, three hundred billion dollars a year through the administration of our tax laws, and thats done largely by voluntary compliance, he said. I think anyone would regard that as an immense achievement. Professor John Coffee, who first met Chirelstein as a student at Yale Law School said Chirelstein was a Man for All Seasons. His students immediately learned that he had a martini-dry wit, a razor-sharp mind, but a uniquely self-effacing teaching method under which he convinced students that he needed their help to solve a seemingly simple problem on the blackboard, Coffee recalled. During the 1970s, his influential work with Victor Brudney illuminated the field of corporate law, but also showed that he was committed to fairness and preferred background norms of equality and equal treatment. Chirelstein graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1950. He earned his J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School in 1953 and served as editor-in-chief of the University of Chicago Law Review. He is survived by his wife, Ellen, and his son, Paul. Our hearts are filled with sorrow at the passing of this great man. 1/3"

Oh, Lesley, we remember the first party when we went to your Sweet Sixteen and then all the many events and maybe some we don't remember. We remember youth. We remember good health. We remember how we all took it for granted and the heady life we all led and the early success of being sought out, sought after and then in a blink, the evaporation as new styles and fickle audiences dictated tastes and careers but your talent remained as it was before. Some capitulated, others were bummed out, but you remained strong. You were filled with wry wit and we laughed and you kept courageously trying new types of writing, using your husky voice as part of your resilience to keep plugging tunes, masters and concepts. You blessedly had the support of Lois, a rock of a partner and Michael as a brotherly part of the team. We were both blessed to have Mr. Marty, our friend in common, but there will be no more yacht trips and no more Mr. Marty to play with at the villa from hell in St. Bart's or the fancy hotels in Capri. There is no more Jean-Claude keeping our table for us at Chez Josephine to celebrate our festival for Valentines Day and no more red ostrich plumes getting in our food from the molting boa you were forced to wear around your neck while we told naughty stories. But darling, we still see you and we see you with all of those people every night when we see the twinkling of the stars in the sky. We know you are with them. We know everyone is singing, dancing, sailing, laughing and telling funny outrageous stories. You have convinced the angels to be your back-up group and to sing harmony. Now no one owns you, Lesley, but we do own our memories of you. Goodbye, our Sweetie Pie from Tenafly. Goodbye. Myrna and Freddie Gershon 1/3"

In the early 1960s, she and two neighbors founded the Bellport Playcrafters, the longest continuing amateur theatre group in the State of New York. She was involved in every phase of production, singing, and acting. Her most memorable role was that of Eliza in ""My Fair Lady."" Other shows included ""South Pacific,"" ""Oklahoma,"" ""Carousel,"" ""The Seven Year Itch,"" ""Kiss Me Kate,"" ""West Side Story,"" ""The Women,"" ""Bell Book"" and ""Candle,"" and her last role as Fiona in ""Brigadoon."" Peggy started a local gift and gourmet shop in Sayville named the Country Mouse. She sold the business and her beach house in Davis Park in the early 1970s when she and Lispenard moved to South Bristol, ME. In South Bristol, she was active in the early years of the Antiques Fair, which continues to benefit Miles Memorial Hospital today. In 2001, the couple moved to Riverwoods. Peggy soon volunteered in both the library and store. A description of Peggy would not be complete without mentioning her love for animals, particularly pets. She generously supported both the Humane Society and the ASPCA. Though many would say it was none of her business, she was outspoken when she saw instances of human cruelty to animals, as she believed that pets were unable to defend themselves. This love was instilled in both her children and grandchildren. Peggy had many accomplishments. Her greatest, however, was as a first-class lady and mother of three, occasionally unruly, boys. She is survived by all three: Nardi Suydam and his partner Elizabeth Parker, Bryce Suydam and his wife, Maryann Gilligan Suydam, all of Marblehead, MA and Peter Suydam and his partner Sally Vittum of New Harbor, ME. Peggy is also survived by four grandchildren, Nick, Bryce, and Jonathan Suydam, and Maggie Butorac, as well as one great-grandchild, Jack Butorac. A memorial service will be held at Saint Anne's Episcopal Church in Sayville at a time and date in June to be announced. 1/3"

Dr. Siffert was the youngest and longest-serving Chair of the Department of Orthopedics at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City, serving for 26 years.

Dr. Siffert also was the Senior Orthopedic Consultant for the Department of Health of NYC. He published over 150 articles with major emphasis on research and clinical pediatric orthopedics. His book ""How Your Child's Body Grows"" was an accessible guide for parents. He was a fellow of many national and international orthopedic societies. He received numerous awards, including the Arthritis Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award, the Mt. Sinai Hospital Jacobi Medallion and the Richman Award for Humanism and Ethics. He also served as the Vice President of the National Easter Seals. Dr. Siffert worked with Care-Medico on month-long medical service missions teaching and delivering medical care in developing countries, including Tunisia, Kenya, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Peru and Haiti. Dr. Siffert insisted that he never retired but ""graduated"" to continue his research in osteoporosis and his work as a graphic artist. Dr. Siffert was an avid artist. His woodcuts were shown in New York and on Martha's Vineyard. Dozens of his woodcuts now hang on permanent display at the United States Courthouse in Manhattan and in the United States Supreme Court.

Siffert, MD, a distinguished physician and former Chair of Orthopaedics at The Mount Sinai Hospital and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. An internationally acclaimed orthopaedic surgeon, he also served as Orthopaedic Surgeon-in- Chief, among other titles, and under his stewardship, the Department of Orthopaedics introduced some of today's most commonly used practices, including hip arthroplasty. His career at Mount Sinai spanned five decades: he started as a resident in orthopaedics in 1946, later joined the voluntary staff, and held leadership positions until his retirement in 2000, after which he maintained the rank of Distinguished Service Professor. Dr. Siffert also served as Senior Consultant to the New York City Department of Health from 1952-- 60, and, driven by a long-time interest in pediatric orthopaedics, in 1970 he founded the Pediatric Orthopaedic Club of New York. A popular visiting professor and lecturer across the country and the world, he authored nearly 200 articles and chapters, as well as four books in his field. He performed many medical service missions abroad, including service as a flight surgeon in World War II. He was also recognized as a skilled artist who crafted intricate woodcut pieces, many of which are on permanent exhibition at the Federal Courthouse in lower Manhattan. We extend our deepest condolences to his family, colleagues, and friends. It is with profound gratitude and fondness that we will remember Dr. Siffert's many years of service, not only to Mount Sinai, but to the global medical community. Peter W.

2015-02-22T00:00:00Z,"RABKIN--Leo. Abstract artist and folk art collector Leo Rabkin died peacefully at his Chelsea home on Sunday, February 15 at the age of 95. Rabkin created colorful painted sculptures inside new and antique boxes. Throughout his long career, he described his works as nugatory divigations, wanderings of the spirit having little or no tangible value. Working with commonplace things found on city streets, he was ahead of his time and of inspiration to younger artists. Born 1919 in Cincinnati, Ohio, Rabkin spent his early life studying the violin and as a boy usher for the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. Early exposure to the rigors of classical music helped him to ""think abstractly."" He was a member of the American Abstract Artists group for more than fifty years, serving as President from 1964-78. The group honored him with a tribute exhibition in the summer of 2014. He also served for many years on the Fine Arts Federation of New York. Leo Rabkin came to New York City in 1945 after service in World War II. He earned a master's in education and guidance counseling at New York University leading to a fifteen-year position at the Livingston School for Girls on King Street. His own experience with psychoanalysis deepened his understanding of art and led to studies with William Baziotes, Hale Woodruff and Robert Inglehart. He married Dorothea Herz (see NYT obit. December 5, 2008) in 1958 and the couple created a landmark collection of American folk art. The Rabkins donated many works to the American Folk Art Museum including the iconic whirligig sculpture of Uncle Sam riding a bicycle. The High Museum of Art in Atlanta also received historic folk art from the Rabkin Collection. In 2000, the couple created the Dorothea and Leo Rabkin Foundation to do charitable work in the arts community. He is survived by his nephew and nieces, Barry Blasberg, Gail Britt and Jill Blasberg Rosenstein, the children of his late sister, Emily Rabkin Blasberg.

2015-02-22T00:00:00Z,"ROTHSCHILD--Joan. Died February 1, 2015 on her 87th birthday. Born in New York City, daughter of Anna (Cohen) and Alfred Rothschild and survived by sister Ruth Mayleas and niece Alexandra Heth, both of NYC. Attended public schools and graduated from Cornell with BA in English in 1948. An activist resident of Greenwich Village in the 1950s and 1960s, Joan participated in the presidential campaigns of Adlai Stevenson, helped establish the Village Independent Democrats, joined the coalition of architects to remove 5th Avenue buses from Washington Square Park and was an active member of the League of Women Voters. Subsequently earned MA in government and PhD in politics from NYU. In 1969, Dr. Rothschild relocated to Cambridge to join Harvard's Program on Technology and Science, and in 1972 joined the faculty of Lowell Technological Institute where she chaired the Women's Studies program and taught political science and technology. As feminist research into technology issues proliferated, she organized panels at annual meetings of the New England Women's Studies Association and the Berkshire Conference on the History of Women. The original work of these feminist scholars appeared in Joan's edited collections, ""Women, Technology and Innovation"" (1982) and ""Machina Ex Dea: Feminist Perspectives on Technology"" (1983), which latter collection was used widely as a text and remained in print for 14 years. Upon retirement from UMass Lowell, Dr. Rothschild returned to NYC and was appointed research associate at the Center for Human Environments at the CUNY Graduate Center to a organize a conference ""Re-Visioning Design and Technology: Feminist Perspectives"" at CUNY in 1995, bringing together practicing as well as academic architects, urban planners and designers, industrial designers, design historians and graphic designers. Her last completed project, the publication of ""The Dream of the Perfect Child"" in 2005, was the culmination of 15 years of research, funded in part by the National Science Foundation, which traced the development of the Enlightenment ideology of human perfectibility and its wedding to science through the 19th Century Positivists and then the Eugenicists as they upended the dream into an inegalitarian program for racial purity and progress. The book proposes not a ban on such research but asks us to listen and think carefully about where we might be heading. Active in community affairs, Dr. Rothschild was a member of the Women's City Club of New York, the Society for the History of Technology and the National Women's Studies Association. She often celebrated NYC as the perfect place to retire to: public transportation is at your doorstep, theaters, museums, art galleries, concert halls abound, and you are never the oldest person in the audience! A gathering in celebration of her life will be held in the near future."

His advanced sympathy with modernism's restraint, formality, and openness with materials focused his individual sensitivities into decades of hand-made collages, plastic sculptures, watercolors, and unique etchings. Light-- and shadow--were constant attendants. An independent in his work, he was fully engaged with the art and social issues of his times. He served as President of the American Abstract Artists often during its early history and more recently on the New York City Art Commission. Leo and his extraordinary wife Dorothea were eminent collectors of American Folk Art: serious benefactors to this culture and to the museum that represents it, New York's Museum of American Folk Art. Their home/studio itself, with its sky-lit great hall, is a museum worthy of being landmarked. Leo came to New York as a young man from Cincinnati, where years of immersion in music and theatre helped form a character of great, insightful humanity. Dorothea came to New York after WWII from Berlin. Here she created a new life of immense intelligence, generosity--and humor.

The New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants (NYSSCPA) mourns the passing of Bernadine Coles Gines, an NYSSCPA member and the first black woman in New York State to earn a CPA license. Mrs. Gines received a BSBA from Virgina State College in 1946 and an MBA from New York University in 1947.

She received her CPA license in 1954 and spent most of her career working for the Office of the New York City Comptroller.

2015-02-22T00:00:00Z,"ADAMS--Robert V. Xerox executive, entrepreneur, board member of the L.A. Opera, philanthropist, nature photographer, beloved husband, father, and grandfather, died in Santa Monica, California on February 10th after a long and courageous battle with heart disease and cancer. He was 83 years old. Born in Hammond, Indiana December 27, 1931, he attended Purdue University on a track scholarship and was the first of his family to attend college. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1954 and in later years he was honored as a Distinguished Engineering Alumnus, won the Outstanding Mechanical Engineer Award, and received an honorary doctorate in engineering. He took great pride in giving back to the university by endowing a chair in Mechanical Engineering. While working as an engineering manager at Inland Steel, he earned his MBA at the University of Chicago and would remain on their advisory board as a lifetime member. The largest lecture hall in the downtown campus of the Business School is named in his honor. He joined Xerox in 1969 when it bought Scientific Data Systems, the company for which he was then working. As president of Xerox's Printing Systems Division he led the development, manufacturing, sales, and marketing of laser printing products and became executive vice president of Xerox in 1985. After retiring he returned to become CEO of Xerox's new venture capital operation, Xerox Technology Ventures. He started nine new companies; two of which went public. In an interview Bob once said, When you're in a new venture, there are no rules. There is no path. You cannot look at where you've been to figure out where you want to go. You cannot look at someone else who's doing it already. You have to invent as you go along. In 1998 he joined the board of the L.A. Opera, creating a long range plan that to this day has a significant impact on the company. With his wife he underwrote the Robert Wilson production of Madama Butterfly and in 2009 he was elected a lifetime trustee of the opera. In recent years he pursued his lifetime passion for photography. His nature photographs drew critical praise, appeared at the San Diego Natural History Museum and were featured at galleries in Twin Bridges, Montana and Venice, California. He loved nature, music, fly fishing, travel, his ranch in Montana, books, fine wines, films, hiking, and was devoted to his family and many friends. Always the last to speak, he had the most to say with the fewest of words. He is survived by his wife Barbara Abercrombie; the children of his first marriage, Leslie Adams of Twin Bridges, Montana; Julie Olson of Oahu, Hawaii; and Bo Adams (Kristine) of Torrance, California; his stepchildren, Brooke Abercrombie and Gillan Abercrombie Frame; his brothers Richard Adams and Paul Adams, and seven grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to The Music Guild of All Saints in Beverly Hills or The Educational Fund of the Los Angeles Opera or a charity of your choice."

The Headmaster, Trustees, Faculty, Staff, Boys, Alumni, and Parents of Saint David's School, New York City, mourn the passing of a dear friend, Headmaster from 1953 to 1990, Headmaster Emeritus and Honorary Trustee thereafter. Mr. Hume is perhaps the most revered and influential figure in the history of our school. He came to Saint David's when he was just twenty-five years old and the school just one. For the next thirty-seven years, this brilliant, principled man, with a wonderfully whimsical sense of humor and powerful intellect, set the direction and tone of the school. He helped create the school's most honored traditions that sustain it to this day. In so many ways, Saint David's is today the school that David Hume helped it to become. During his headship, 1,200 young men graduated. David was a graduate of Canterbury School, Yale University, and Columbia University. During his tenure at Saint David's, Mr. Hume served as President of the New York State Association of Independent Schools, the Country Day School Headmasters Association, Interschool Orchestras of New York, the Elementary School Heads Association, St. Thomas More Chapel (Yale University), and the Guild of Independent Schools of New York City; Vice-President of the Independent Schools Multi-Media Center; Director of the National Association of Independent Schools; Trustee of the Professional Children's School of New York City, Marymount School of New York, and Nightingale-Bamford School, New York City. He was a member of the Elizabethan Club, Yale University. He was an avid reader, writer, painter, sailor, boat builder and patron of the arts. Mr. Hume's tremendous dedication to the School for more than six decades is appreciated and celebrated. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Catherine, his sons, Christopher, '68, Adam, '70, Benjamin, '71, and Noah, '75, his daughters, Charity, '72, Amity, '74, and his sister, Rozanne Edmondson, and her sons, Timothy, '73 and Nicholas, '75 and their families at this time.

Sinai St. Luke's Hospital from complications of cancer. He was sixty-four. Mr. Schwartz, a graduate of Yale College, University of Chicago Law School and a Mellon fellow at Clare College, Cambridge, began his legal career at Skadden Arps. He then served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, where he held supervisory positions including head of the environmental unit. He received awards from the Environmental Protection Agency for the negotiation of a major Superfund settlement and from the Department of Justice for superior performance in civil environmental enforcement. In addition to environmental cases during his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office, Mr. Schwartz successfully defended the General Services Administration in an action brought by Richard Serra, who alleged the government's decision to move his sculpture ""Tilted Arc"" from the Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan constituted a breach of contract and violated the free expression and due process rights of the artist. Mr. Schwartz joined Fried Frank in 1992 where he was highly regarded for his representation in the environmental field as well in real estate and private equity. He represented Tishman Speyer in its acquisition of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. It was the largest real estate transaction in the United States at the time. His environmental transactional practice included negotiation of the first prospective purchased agreement in California with Region 9 of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also known as lover of food and wine, Mr. Schwartz was on the the board of GrowNYC and did pro bono legal work for the non-profit sponsor of ""green markets"" throughout New York City. Mr. Schwartz is survived by his wife Wendy, his sons Isaac, a portfolio manager at Robotti & Company, and Noah, an advisor on the National Security Council staff in Washington, D.C., and his brother Dr. Leslie Schwartz of Juno Beach, Florida. Funeral services will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue in New York on February 24 at 1:30pm. In lieu of flowers, the family would prefer donations to GrowNYC, 51 Chambers Street, room 228, NY, NY 10007 or to the American Friends of the Mendelsohn Foundation, c/o Susan Bender, Treasurer, 60 W. 57th Street, NY, NY l0019. 1/3"

Beloved by all who knew him, he was an erudite man with courtly manners and a sly sense of humor. Mr. Howard was born on Jun 8, 1925 in Memphis, TN to Hal B. Howard and Marianne Crawford Howard. His early years were spent in Memphis attending Pentacost -Garrison School. His high school years were spent at The Choate School in Wallingford, Ct . He proceeded to Yale University for college and received a Bachelor's Degree in International Relations. Furthering his education, Hal received an MBA from Harvard Business School. He is a Certified Investment Counselor as well. Mr. Howard served in the Armed Services, posted in Japan. Throughout his illustrious career, Hal amassed over forty years of experience in the field of investment management. He is considered an expert in his field. He began his professional career began with T. Rowe Price of Baltimore, MD and was asked to move to New York City to start the office there. He remained with T Rowe Price for twenty -five years occupying the positions of Vice President and Director. In 1999, he established his own investment consulting firm, working with clients to meet their investment objectives by advising them and managing their portfolios. Until his death, Mr. Howard remained active in the investment business. While working in New York, Mr. Howard resided in Greenwich, Ct. There he raised his children, Hal Bowen Howard, III and Sara Crump Crawford Howard from his former marriage to the late Sara Macrae Humphreys Howard. Hal has lived primarily in Palm Beach, Florida for the last 25 years with his wife Suzanne de Rose Howard, who has also predeceased him. While in Palm Beach, Mr. Howard was a devoted member of Bethesda-by-the Sea Episcopal Church, proudly serving as an usher on many Sundays. On Saturday mornings Hal could be found at Green's Pharmacy for breakfast. Hal was a philanthropic man and gave generously to the things that were important to him. Recurring themes in Mr. Howard's generous philanthropy were his sentimental attachment to Memphis and its history, his dedication to superior education for those that might not be able to afford it. He was devoted to ""give opportunity to people who otherwise would not have it"" and took great joy in honoring others through his gifts. In recognition of his ongoing gifts to the Memphis Garden Club Mr Howard was named an honorary member of the Garden Club of America, which he found both humbling and amusing as it is an all women's organization. Devotion to his heritage took form in the donation of a refurbished home, the current headquarters of Memphis Heritage and named Howard Hall in his honor. His philanthropic endeavors are numerous -but most recently he had dedicated his time as the Founder of the Crawford- Howard Foundation in Memphis, where he also served on the Board of Trustees of Elmwood Cemetery.

2015-02-27T00:00:00Z,"KAHN--Irving, born December 19, 1905, passed away peacefully on Tuesday, February 24, 2015 at his home in New York, NY. He was husband to the late Ruth Perl Kahn; son to Esther (Mamie) and Saul Kahn; father of the late Donald W. Kahn PhD and of Alan R. Kahn and Thomas G. Kahn CFA; brother of the late Peter Keane, the late Leonore (Lee) Reichart and the late Helen (Happy) Reichert; grandfather of Tamar McNally, Jeremy Kahn, Amanda Kahn-Kirby PhD, Kimberly Kahn DVM, Andrew Kahn, Elizabeth Kahn and Victoria Kahn; and great- grandfather of Nina, Kaitlin, Minjonet, Julia, Maia, Miles, Manndon and Maxannie. Irving Kahn was born in New York City. He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and attended the City College of New York. He also studied at Columbia Business School under the late Benjamin Graham, who became Irving's mentor and was one of Wall Street's early proponents of value investing and fundamental security analysis. Irving began his career on Wall Street in 1928 working for the firms Hammerschlag, Borg & Co. and H. Hentz & Co. It was at Hentz that he met Graham, a client of that firm who taught Columbia Business School's well-known class on value investing. Irving introduced himself to Graham and started to sit in on his class. Graham eventually appointed Irving as his teaching assistant, which began what would become a lifelong friendship and mentorship. Irving would assist Graham in research for his landmark text ""Security Analysis,"" as well as ""Storage and Stability"" and World Commodities and ""World Currencies."" Irving also met, Ruth, his wife of 65 years in Graham's class. Irving worked for the firm of Loab, Rhoades & Co. and then Wertheim & Co. After the war, he became a partner at the firm J.R. Willison, where he met his longtime associate William F. DeLuca who worked with Irving for the rest of his career. Irving then became a partner of Abraham & Company, which was acquired by Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb. He continued at Lehman Brothers, running the Kahn investment team until 1978, when he and his sons, Thomas and Alan, founded the New York StockExchange member firm, Kahn Brothers & Co. (now Kahn Brothers Group). Irving assumed the role of Chairman of the firm, a title he held until 2014 when he became Chairman Emeritus. Thomas is currently its President. From its beginnings, the firm practiced and continues to practice a modified value investing strategy that was inspired by the lessons Benjamin Graham taught Irving over many decades. Irving was a founding member of the New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA), the largest CFA member society in the world, and the Financial Analysts Journal, its investment research publication. He was an early supporter of security analyst education and took the CFA exam in its first year (earning Charter #"

Born October 9, 1940 in Brooklyn, he overcame difficult childhood circumstances, earning a scholarship to NYU Law School, from which he graduated second in his class. His first and only job as an attorney came with the firm now known as Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz, where he championed the rights of injured people, and along the way, as a partner for the past 42 years, mentored several generations of lawyers. His greatest joys were in the simple pleasures of life, particularly spending time with his family, watching a ball game or playing tennis. In his wife, Harriet, he found the perfect partner, and their 50-year marriage was marked by their unyielding devotion to each other and the joy of their shared lives. He was no less committed to his son and his wife, Richard and Meredith Steigman, and his daughter, Dr. Allison Steigman. His grandchildren, Evan and Kate Steigman, were the light of his life.

He was husband to the late Ruth Perl Kahn; son to Esther (Mamie) and Saul Kahn; father of the late Donald W. Kahn PhD and of Alan R. Kahn and Thomas G. Kahn CFA; brother of the late Peter Keane, the late Leonore (Lee) Reichart and the late Helen (Happy) Reichert; grandfather of Tamar McNally, Jeremy Kahn, Amanda Kahn-Kirby PhD, Kimberly Kahn DVM, Andrew Kahn, Elizabeth Kahn and Victoria Kahn; and great- grandfather of Nina, Kaitlin, Minjonet, Julia, Maia, Miles, Manndon and Maxannie. Irving Kahn was born in New York City. He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and attended the City College of New York. He also studied at Columbia Business School under the late Benjamin Graham, who became Irving's mentor and was one of Wall Street's early proponents of value investing and fundamental security analysis. Irving began his career on Wall Street in 1928 working for the firms Hammerschlag, Borg & Co. and H. Hentz & Co. It was at Hentz that he met Graham, a client of that firm who taught Columbia Business School's well-known class on value investing. Irving introduced himself to Graham and started to sit in on his class. Graham eventually appointed Irving as his teaching assistant, which began what would become a lifelong friendship and mentorship. Irving would assist Graham in research for his landmark text ""Security Analysis,"" as well as ""Storage and Stability"" and ""World Commodities and World Currencies."" Irving also met, Ruth, his wife of 65 years in Graham's class. Irving worked for the firm of Loab, Rhoades & Co. and then Wertheim & Co. After the war, he became a partner at the firm J.R. Willison, where he met his longtime associate William F. DeLuca who worked with Irving for the rest of his career. Irving then became a partner of Abraham & Company, which was acquired by Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb. He continued at Lehman Brothers, running the Kahn investment team until 1978, when he and his sons, Thomas and Alan, founded the New York StockExchange member firm, Kahn Brothers & Co. (now Kahn Brothers Group). Irving assumed the role of Chairman of the firm, a title he held until 2014 when he became Chairman Emeritus. Thomas is currently its President. From its beginnings, the firm practiced and continues to practice a modified value investing strategy that was inspired by the lessons Benjamin Graham taught Irving over many decades. Irving was a founding member of the New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA), the largest CFA member society in the world, and the Financial Analysts Journal, its investment research publication. He was an early supporter of security analyst education and took the CFA exam in its first year (earning Charter #"

Irving introduced himself to Graham and started to sit in on his class. Graham eventually appointed Irving as his teaching assistant, which began what would become a lifelong friendship and mentorship. Irving would assist Graham in research for his landmark text ""Security Analysis,"" as well as ""Storage and Stability"" and ""World Commodities and World Currencies."" Irving also met, Ruth, his wife of 65 years in Graham's class. Irving worked for the firm of Loab, Rhoades & Co. and then Wertheim & Co. After the war, he became a partner at the firm J.R. Willison, where he met his longtime associate William F. DeLuca who worked with Irving for the rest of his career.

He continued at Lehman Brothers, running the Kahn investment team until 1978, when he and his sons, Thomas and Alan, founded the New York StockExchange member firm, Kahn Brothers & Co. (now Kahn Brothers Group). Irving assumed the role of Chairman of the firm, a title he held until 2014 when he became Chairman Emeritus. Thomas is currently its President. From its beginnings, the firm practiced and continues to practice a modified value investing strategy that was inspired by the lessons Benjamin Graham taught Irving over many decades. Irving was a founding member of the New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA), the largest CFA member society in the world, and the Financial Analysts Journal, its investment research publication.

2015-03-01T00:00:00Z,"MIRON--Issachar. Issachar Miron, Israeli Composer of Tzena Tzena, died at 95 on January 29, 2015. Born Stefan Michrovsky in Kutno, Poland, he emigrated to Palestine in 1939. His family perished in the Holocaust. The cherished memory of his family and the six million fueled a lifelong dedication to them through his music, writings, poetry and photography. While serving in the Jewish Brigade of the British Army in Palestine, Mr. Miron composed Tzena, Tzena, which became a worldwide hit and an anthem of optimism in the years that followed the Israeli War of Independence. It was sung in some 39 languages and was performed and recorded by numerous leading artists in the United States, including Pete Seeger, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, Judy Garland, Dusty Springfield, Connie Francis, Vic Damone, Chubby Checker, the Smothers Brothers and Arlo Guthrie. The version recorded by Pete Seeger and the Weavers climbed to the top of the Hit Parade in the 1950s. Mr. Miron served as Officer-in-Chief of Cultural Programs of the Israeli Defense Forces and later as National Deputy Director of Music for Israel's Ministry of Education and Culture, where he embarked on a mission to unite through music the diverse new nation. In the May 1961 issue of ""Reader's Digest"", Oscar Schisgall wrote about Issachar Miron and this phenomenon, stating that the people of Israel were using music ""to shape a more harmonious nation."" After moving to New York City in the early 60's, he served as Dean of the Music Department of the Jewish Teachers Seminary and as National Director of Special Educational and Inspirational Programs for the United Jewish Appeal. In the 70's, he collaborated with Theodore Bikel to arrange and record the album ""Silent No More,"" which raised awareness of the struggle of Soviet Jewry. His song ""Ufi Ruach"" became the first Hebrew song to be broadcast on Egyptian radio in the aftermath of the 1977 Egyptian-Israeli peace talks. Another of his songs, ""Ma Yafeh Hayom,"" has become a staple of the Reform Movement's Sabbath liturgy. In 1996, he published a book of his poems called ""Eighteen Gates of Jewish Holidays and Festivals."" A true Renaissance man, his artistic range was immense -from vast contributions to Jewish liturgical and Klezmer music, to serious classical works, to hundreds of popular songs and numerous poems, writings, documentaries and commentaries. Over the years, Mr. Miron received many awards for his work, including ASCAP's Deems Taylor Award for creative writing and the Israel Engel Prize for Music. The late Tsipora Miron, his esteemed collaborator and beloved wife of nearly 71 years, was an accomplished pianist and organist. Mr. Miron is survived by their three daughters, Ruth Schleider, Shlomit Aviram and Miriam Lipton, plus six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. More information about Mr. Miron and his life and work is available on his website: IssacharMiron.com, and many performances by various artists of his most popular song, Tzena Tzena, are available on YouTube. 1/3"

Mr. Chesnoff was widely regarded as one of the most respected and knowledgeable journalists covering the Middle East. Early in his career he was a reporter for NBC News and the International Herald Tribune, before becoming the bureau chief in Paris for Newsweek. After returning to the United States, he served as the Executive Editor of Newsweek International and later was the Senior Correspondent for US News & World Report covering the Middle East.

He was the author of several well-received books, including If Israel Lost The War with Ed Klein and Robert Littell, Philippines, Pack of Thieves and The Arrogance of the French.

2015-03-02T00:00:00Z,"COHN--Dr. Alice Ginott, a psychologist committed to nurturing empathetic communication, died on February 23, 2015 at her home in Manhattan, age 90. She had suffered a stroke three years earlier, which prevented her from expressing herself in any of the seven languages she spoke. A second stroke ended her life. Burial services and shiva were held privately. Alice was born in Presov, Czechoslovakia to Martin and Pearl Weinberger Grunfeld. Her adoring relationship with her father was a central part of her life, providing the foundation of love that enabled her to express love to others. She was saved from the Holocaust by her mother who, with the aid of a brother who had befriended a US Vice Consul in Prague and another who was already living in New Jersey, arranged for visas for the family to come to the US in November 1938. Had this not happened, she might have joined her Czech girlfriends who, as she later learned, were among the first to be gassed at Auschwitz. Arriving in America as a poor refugee ""greener"" during the Depression, Alice turned a hard life into a good life. Prevented from pursuing a career as a teacher of English literature at Montclair State Teachers College because of her accent, she transferred to Indiana University Bloomington on a scholarship, participated in the 1953 Kinsey Study, worked to desegregate Bloomington, and found her true calling in psychology. She received a Ph.D. in experimental psychology from the New School for Social Research in 1959. Alice had two daughters with her first husband, Arthur Lasker: Roz Lasker, a physician, and Mimi Kaough, an attorney. In 1969, she married Dr. Haim Ginott, a prominent child psychologist who she met at a yahrzeit memorial celebration for the Yiddish author Sholem Aleichem. The couple worked closely together until Ginott's death from cancer in 1973. In 1986 she married Theodore Cohn, a management consultant who she met in New Delhi at a professional conference. For 40 years, Alice maintained an active practice as a psychotherapist and world- wide lecturer, bringing knowledge, intuition, sensitivity, pragmatism and compassion to her work. She wrote a weekly column on parenting for King Features, published in 70 international newspapers. In 2003, with Dr. H. Wallace Goddard, she revised Ginott's classic, Between Parent and Child, which has sold 250,000 copies in 18 languages. Alice loved to ice skate, ski cross-country, dance, listen to music, and converse. After visiting Auschwitz in 1992, she and her husband established the Alice Field Cohn Chair in Yiddish Studies at Indiana University to foster the continuity of Yiddish. Alice wished to be memorialized in the form of gifts to the Borns Jewish Studies Program (Alice Field Cohn Chair in Yiddish Studies), Indiana University, Goodbody Hall 326, 1011 East 3rd Street, Bloomington, IN 47405. She is survived by her husband Theodore, two daughters, two grandchildren, three step-children and four step-grandchildren. 1/3"

Too careless to pass engineering at NYU, he graduated CCNY with a BS in physics and MS from Stevens Institute of Technology. Acing a company's aptitude test, Bob was recruited into a burgeoning new field that wasn't yet widely labeled: computer systems analyst. His colleagues described his mind as ""brilliant"". The crafts zeitgeist of the 60s called him. Not being adept at any himself, he opened a crafts store. In time, this serial entrepreneur became a futon furniture designer and manufacturer, patenting three futon frame mechanisms. An intrepid sourcer, he developed factories in the US and South America. The last 12 years he fell in love with unusual hardwoods he found in Indonesia, where he was committed to sustainable harvesting. Products were sold in the Greenpoint Brooklyn FTS warehouse. Known for his love of family and wry wit, Bob leaves behind his wife of 49 years, his daughter, son in law, two grandchildren, brother, his wife's siblings and spouses and beloved nieces, nephews and cousins and friends from all over the world.

2015-03-06T00:00:00Z,"BREGER--William N. 92, died on February 23 at Weill Cornell Medical Center. Bill, born in the Bronx, attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City, and held a graduate degree in Architecture from Harvard University and a PhD in Philosophy from the New York University. He served in the Planning Department of the United States Army during World War II, and was discharged with honor. In the years shortly following the War he was the assistant to Walter Gropius at the Harvard University School of Architecture. Upon his return to New York he established his own architecture firm. Bill was a Chairman of the School of Architecture at Pratt Institute, a Visiting Lecturer in Health Care Design at Columbia University, a Lecturing Professor at the New York School of Interior Design, and a Lecturing Professor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, specializing in English and French Furniture. He was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects. One of his students, subsequently a prominent New York architect, remarked: ""Bill was tough on us, but when I began practicing architecture in the real world, I realized the value of his approach: the clients were much tougher."" Over a long career, Bill received many design awards; among others, he was a runner up in the 1948 national competition for the Gateway to the West in St. Louis, and the architect of the award winning Civic Center Synagogue in Lower Manhattan. His compassion and humanity was manifested by an architectural practice spanning his lifelong career, specializing in the health care field, in which he pioneered the environment as a therapeutic tool approach. His novel designs and methods were summarized in the book ""Nursing Home Development"" co-authored with William R. Pomeranz. Bill was an editor of the ""Encyclopedia of Philosophy"" published by Macmillan Publishing Co., and wrote numerous publications on nursing homes and extended care facility design. For 92 years family and friends enjoyed Bill's brilliant insight, sharp wit and honesty to fault. He was deeply loved and will be painfully missed. He is survived by his wife of 25 years, Krystyna Piotrowska-Breger; his daughter Willow Harth of Madison, WI and a step-daughter Kinga Piotrowska-Meckier of Brooklyn, NY, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

2015-03-06T00:00:00Z,"ROGERS--Sylvia Deborah, passed away peacefully from brief complications of cancer on March 4th, 2015 in her Armonk, New York home of 45 years. She is survived by her husband of fifty-four years Steve Rogers, her three sons Ken (Katie), Greg (Dana) and Don (Danna), and her eight grandchildren, as well as her siblings Leonard Wolfe of New Haven, CT and Ruth Rabineau of Ruxton, MD. Sylvia was born in London, England July 1937 to her loving parents Henry and Tillie Rose Solomon Wolfe. Together with her siblings, their family survived repeated Nazi air raids during World War II. This was one of Sylvia's formidable experiences, and a lifelong source of inspiration and strength. It also began her deep admiration for Winston Churchill and the Queen Mother who she quoted often and who brought her comfort to the very end. In 1948, Sylvia and her family sailed the Queen Elizabeth from London to start a new life in America. Her first steps on the sparkling streets of New York formed an indelible image that began her love for America, and the freedoms and security it provided. She went on to graduate from Forest Hills high school in New York and attended New York University. At age 19, she met her husband-to-be on a blind date in Baltimore, Maryland. They married and began one of her life's most cherished and selfless works, the raising of her three sons. Sylvia was a patron of the arts, and was co-Chair of the Armonk Art Show for a decade. She was an active tennis player, calling herself ""the Lobster"" for her dangerous lob game, but ultimately converted full time to golf where she loved to compete and socialize with her many friends at Whippoorwill and Ballen Isles Country Clubs. Sylvia was a whirlwind of energy and a friend to all. She had an ability to make people laugh and feel at ease. She often said ""love is the answer"" and lived her life in constant motion in a celebration of life. She had an iron will and strong held beliefs, and naturally saw the best in everyone. She spent her final days smiling and laughing with her family, once again touching those around her with vibrancy and optimism, which lives on in her loving memory.

2015-03-07T00:00:00Z,"NIVES--Fred. March 4, 2015, 94 years old. Born Vienna Austria in 1921. Fred was a lover of life who lived every day to the fullest. This was not surprising for a man who in 1938, at the age of 17 in order to escape from the Nazis after Kristallnacht, walked from Austria at night hiding in the woods during the day to find refuge in Belgium. After immigrating to the U.S. in 1940, he proudly served in the U.S. Army from 1942-1946 in the European Theater in Paris under General Eisenhower's command. He was reunited with his father Bernhard and brother Ernest at war's end, but his mother Roza perished in Auschwitz. Fred Nives was truly one of a kind. Larger than life, he was an avid sportsman with unstoppable energy. He relished his early ski adventures in Davos and then his chalet in Meribel, France. His love of athletics included tennis, swimming and his treadmill. He was a voracious reader, classical music concertgoer and opera lover, especially Wagner. In his youth, he piloted his plane from Paris all over Europe, and ran his boat along the French Riviera to the Greek Isles. As an accomplished horseman for 50 years, he and his beloved wife Donna rode in Hunter-Pace events. In events where he was not riding, Fred became an official timer at the finish lines. He was also the Treasurer of the Greenwich Riding and Trails Association. He was proud that the GRTA's budget was perfectly balanced while he was the treasurer. His wide circle of friends and family reveled in his contagious enthusiasm, keen intelligence and marvelous sense of humor. He graciously brought everybody together for many holidays and occasions. Always generously entertaining guests with his hilarious jokes, wonderful stories, choice bottles of wines and love of fine foods. He had a strong will, strong opinions and strong mind. A successful entrepreneur with a brilliant and decisive business mind, Mr. Nives started a foreign currency service business in the 1950's and then a consumer finance company which was sold in 1963 to become Sterling Bancorp in New York. An accomplished Wall Street investor with a seat on the New York Stock Exchange until 1969, he was a general partner in investment partnership Apollo Associates until 1974. He left Wall Street to start Omni Financial Corporation, a very successful consumer financial company, in the early 70's. He wanted to help military personnel obtain consumer loans because he remembered how difficult it was for him to obtain a loan to buy his first car after the war. But, the greatest accomplishment of his life was his marriage to his extraordinary and beautiful wife Donna. He met the love of his life at the age of 37 in New York City and they married shortly thereafter. They shared a love of animals, which became a big part of their life together. In addition to their equestrian activities, they founded the 30+ year old Animal Rescue Group ""Adopt-A- Dog"" located in Greenwich, CT and Armonk, NY. ""Fred and Donna also generously funded the Bronx Zoo's ""Fred and Donna Nives African Wild Dog Pavillion"" Their love of animals and each other was apparent to all their friends and family. Mr. Nives also was a longtime Board member of The Center for Hearing and Communication. Member of the Greenwich Riding & Trails Association, The Graduate Club of New Haven, The Stamford Yacht Club, Goldens Bridge Hounds, North Salem, New York and Fairfield County Hounds in Bridgewater, CT. Mr. Nives is survived by Donna Nives, Julie Nives Schwartzman, Dan and Zoe Schwartzman, Miriam and Marissa Nives, Vivian and Richard Van Buren, Annie, Jimmy, James and Nicholas Angellino. Funeral services will be held Monday, March 9 at 1:30pm at Temple Sholom, Greenwich Connecticut.

Bill, born in the Bronx, attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City, and held a graduate degree in Architecture from Harvard University and a PhD in Philosophy from the New York University. He served in the Planning Department of the United States Army during World War II, and was discharged with honor. In the years shortly following the War he was the assistant to Walter Gropius at the Harvard University School of Architecture. Upon his return to New York he established his own architecture firm. Bill was a Chairman of the School of Architecture at Pratt Institute, a Visiting Lecturer in Health Care Design at Columbia University, a Lecturing Professor at the New York School of Interior Design, and a Lecturing Professor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, specializing in English and French Furniture. He was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects. One of his students, subsequently a prominent New York architect, remarked: ""Bill was tough on us, but when I began practicing architecture in the real world, I realized the value of his approach: the clients were much tougher."" Over a long career, Bill received many design awards; among others, he was a runner up in the 1948 national competition for the Gateway to the West in St. Louis, and the architect of the award winning Civic Center Synagogue in Lower Manhattan. His compassion and humanity was manifested by an architectural practice spanning his lifelong career, specializing in the health care field, in which he pioneered the environment as a therapeutic tool approach. His novel designs and methods were summarized in the book ""Nursing Home Development"" co-authored with William R. Pomeranz. Bill was an editor of the ""Encyclopedia of Philosophy"" published by Macmillan Publishing Co., and wrote numerous publications on nursing homes and extended care facility design. For 92 years family and friends enjoyed Bill's brilliant insight, sharp wit and honesty to fault. He was deeply loved and will be painfully missed.

2015-03-08T00:00:00Z,"LIPKIN--Evelyn Appell. Resident of New York City, formerly of Chicago. Evelyn Appell Lipkin passed away at home on March 1, 2015. She was born February 12, 1921 aboard the S.S. Presidente Wilson at Governor's Island in the wave of immigrants arriving from Europe. She received her BA from Brooklyn College in Art and Art History and took classes at the New School for Social Research where she met Stan Lipkin, who became her life partner and cherished husband. She was a cryptographer during WWII in New York and later for the United States Navy, Bureau of Ships in Washington, DC. With her husband overseas, Evelyn relocated to Chicago to study for her Masters degree at the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration. A social worker in the tradition of Jane Addams, she had a deep concern for those with limited resources who faced oppression and discrimination. Her career began at the Jewish Children's Bureau focused on adoption and foster care placement. After devoting her energies to raising three children (Ian, Joan, Laurel) she became a counselor in private practice and professor at George Williams College. She was beloved by faculty, students and patients. She retired in her late 80's after a courageous and successful fight against cancer and heart disease. Evelyn was among the founders of Women Strike for Peace, active in the antiwar movement, the League of Women Voters, the Urban League, as well as a proud and early member of the NAACP and a long-time supporter of the Southern Poverty Law Center. In Chicago she organized and began the first tot lots in Hyde Park, started and volunteered in the after school programs at the Hyde Park Study Center, and worked with teen mothers on the west side of Chicago at the Parent/Child Center. She was a long-time subscriber to many Chicago theater companies, Chicago and New York museums and other cultural venues. She was known for her sharp mind her children believed she forgot almost nothing. Playful and known for her edgy sense of humor, she loved to entertain and travel, was enormously engaging, and energetic. Always generous and caring, she welcomed many visitors of all ages and backgrounds to her home throughout her life. With her husband, she supported the work of writers, teachers, and visual artists establishing a number of prizes in New York and Chicago, and considered herself a passionate lover of all art forms, in particular dance, theater, music. She lived most of her adult life in Chicago's Hyde Park, a stalwart defender of integration and equal access to opportunities for all races and creeds; she set a strong example in resisting the white flight from the inner city to suburbia. In the last years of her life she returned to New York City as a resident of the Upper West Side where she kindled new friendships and maintained a cultural schedule that would challenge people decades younger and in better health. Her intellect, interest in others, will to live and generosity of spirit were intact to the very end. A resilient fighter, she tackled a number of very difficult health challenges and battled them all with fierceness and a tenacity to wring all she could from her time in this world. Evelyn and Stan were married 72 years. He survives her. Together, they raised three children and shared many adventures. She wished to be remembered as a loving wife, proud mother, loyal and good friend and an activist. Evelyn was an extraordinary woman whose like we will not see again. Her family and many friends adored her, will miss her always and keep her close. Services private.

2015-03-08T00:00:00Z,"HAMMERSTEIN MATHIAS-- Alice, the daughter of Oscar Hammerstein II and Myra Finn, died Thursday, February 26, at the age of 93. According to her daughter, Melinda Walsh, the cause was pneumonia. For many years, she was the Hammerstein family representative to The Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization, and continued to be the spokeswoman for her father's work. With the insight of having seen the original production of ""Show Boat"" in 1927, she addressed the cast of the musicals New York Philharmonic concert performance last fall during rehearsals. As a young woman, she worked for her father doing research on specific subjects to support her father's lyrics, becoming immersed in the tradition of the New England clambake for the song ""A Real Nice Clambake in Carousel."" The material presented to her father often far exceeded what was necessary, something she attributed to what she termed ""research poisoning"". The recipient of several ASCAP Awards, she was the lyricist and co-author of ""Babes In Toyland"", an adaptation of the Victor Herbert Operetta, and she also wrote English lyrics to Franz Lehar's ""The Merry Widow"" and Johann Strauss' ""A NightIn Venice"", all of which were presented in the repertory of the Light Opera of Manhattan (LOOM). She was also associated with conductor Thomas Scherman and his Little Orchestra Society, for whom she translated lyrics of the American premiere of Richard Strauss' ""Intermezzo"" and adapted Mozart's ""The Magic Flute"" for presentation by puppets, both of which were performed at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. With her late husband Philip Mathias, she wrote and produced a musical Centennial tribute to Jerome Kern, ""The Music Is Kern"", in 1985, and was proud of having hired the then-unknown Susan Stroman to direct it. She enjoyed a lively correspondence with her father from 1928 until his death in 1960, and carefully saved the letters, which were warm, chatty, encouraging, and sometimes stern. Oscar treasured his daughter's precocious and painstakingly detailed notes and they were returned to her upon his death. Over the years, she worked on a book that included all the letters, which she titled, ""From OH to AH."" Her hope to publish the book was cut short by her death. She was a mainstay for family and friends, always knowing where she stood and wasn't afraid to say so, and what she said was worth listening to. We will miss her cockeyed optimistic view of the world and the future. Predeceased by her husband Philip Mathias in 2006, Alice Hammerstein Mathias is survived by her children, Melinda Walsh of Bedford Hills, New York and Peter Mathias of Monroe, Connecticut, a step-sister, Susan Blanchard of Roxbury, Connecticut, four grandchildren and two great- granddaughters. 1/3"

This was not surprising for a man who in 1938, at the age of 17 in order to escape from the Nazis after Kristallnacht, walked from Austria at night hiding in the woods during the day to find refuge in Belgium. After immigrating to the U.S. in 1940, he proudly served in the U.S. Army from 1942-1946 in the European Theater in Paris under General Eisenhower's command. He was reunited with his father Bernhard and brother Ernest at war's end, but his mother Roza perished in Auschwitz. Fred Nives was truly one of a kind. Larger than life, he was an avid sportsman with unstoppable energy. He relished his early ski adventures in Davos and then his chalet in Meribel, France. His love of athletics included tennis, swimming and his treadmill. He was a voracious reader, classical music concertgoer and opera lover, especially Wagner. In his youth, he piloted his plane from Paris all over Europe, and ran his boat along the French Riviera to the Greek Isles. As an accomplished horseman for 50 years, he and his beloved wife Donna rode in Hunter-Pace events. In events where he was not riding, Fred became an official timer at the finish lines. He was also the Treasurer of the Greenwich Riding and Trails Association. He was proud that the GRTA's budget was perfectly balanced while he was the treasurer. His wide circle of friends and family reveled in his contagious enthusiasm, keen intelligence and marvelous sense of humor. He graciously brought everybody together for many holidays and occasions. Always generously entertaining guests with his hilarious jokes, wonderful stories, choice bottles of wines and love of fine foods. He had a strong will, strong opinions and strong mind. A successful entrepreneur with a brilliant and decisive business mind, Mr. Nives started a foreign currency service business in the 1950's and then a consumer finance company which was sold in 1963 to become Sterling Bancorp in New York. An accomplished Wall Street investor with a seat on the New York Stock Exchange until 1969, he was a general partner in investment partnership Apollo Associates until 1974. He left Wall Street to start Omni Financial Corporation, a very successful consumer financial company, in the early 70's. He wanted to help military personnel obtain consumer loans because he remembered how difficult it was for him to obtain a loan to buy his first car after the war. But, the greatest accomplishment of his life was his marriage to his extraordinary and beautiful wife Donna. He met the love of his life at the age of 37 in New York City and they married shortly thereafter. They shared a love of animals, which became a big part of their life together. In addition to their equestrian activities, they founded the 30+ year old Animal Rescue Group ""Adopt-A- Dog"" located in Greenwich, CT and Armonk, NY. ""Fred and Donna also generously funded the Bronx Zoo's ""Fred and Donna Nives African Wild Dog Pavillion"" Their love of animals and each other was apparent to all their friends and family. Mr. Nives also was a longtime Board member of The Center for Hearing and Communication.

2015-03-08T00:00:00Z,"CAPRA--J. Donald ""Don"" MD. President Emeritus of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, died February 24, 2015 at the age of 77. The cause of his death was a brain tumor, his wife said. He was born July 20, 1937 in Burlington, VT to Italian immigrants. He spent his youth in Barre, VT and went on to the University of Vermont in Burlington, earning a B.S. in 1959 and graduating from the UVM Medical School summa cum laude in 1963. His internship years were spent at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City. His research career, which he began in Vermont with Dr. Thomas Tomasi, continued at the National Institutes of Health with Dr. Alan Peterkofsky. In 1967 he returned to NYC for a two year guest investigatorship with Dr. Henry Kunkel at the Rockefeller University. He then joined the first faculty of Mt. Sinai Medical School and continued there until 1974. At that time he joined the University of Texas Health Science Center in Dallas, TX as a full professor and then proceeded to do some of his most important work in antibody research, laying the foundation for the field of monoclonal antibody therapy in a number of human diseases. At age 60 he was asked to be the president of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation in Oklahoma City, OK, a non-profit medical research institution. He felt that this was the challenge of his lifetime, and during his nine year tenure he doubled the size of the institute and increased its NIH funding from $8 million to $27 million. For the last eight years of his life he consulted for universities and large and small pharmaceutical firms. In 1958 Don married Patricia Hollister, and they raised two sons. He was predeceased by his parents Mary DeMaio Capra and Richard Capra. He is survived by his wife of 57 years, his son Jay Capra, MD and wife Nancy of Abilene, TX, his son Tony Capra of Carrollton, TX, his grandson Donald Capra and wife Sally of Amarillo, TX, granddaughter Sarah Seltzer and husband Will and great-step grandson Cooper Seltzer of Fort Worth, TX, and by granddaughter Twig Capra of New York City. He is also survived by his sister Carolyn Sanderson of Sagamore, MA and his nieces Lisa Morgera of Shrewsbury, MA and Kathy Riedinger of Double Oak, TX. Don's research career was prodigious. He was Principal Investigator on 72 NIH grants and had 375 scientific publications, including chapters and books. He was a founding member and past president of the Henry Kunkel Society, was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the Association of American Physicians, and of the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and served as an officer for the American Association of Immunologists. His love of science and teaching was only surpassed by his love of family and the Dallas Cowboys. A Celebration of Don's life will be held March 21, 2015 at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation at 2:00pm. All are welcome. A second celebration will be in Barre, VT at a time to be announced in late spring, where Don's ashes will be interred in Hope Cemetery.

2015-03-08T00:00:00Z,"COHN--Dr. Alice Ginott. Dr. Alice Ginott Cohn, a psychologist committed to nurturing empathetic communication, died on February 23, 2015 at her home in Manhattan, age 90. She had suffered a stroke three years earlier, which prevented her from expressing herself in any of the seven languages she spoke. A second stroke ended her life. Burial services and shiva were held privately. Alice was born in Presov, Czechoslovakia to Martin and Pearl Weinberger Grunfeld. Her adoring relationship with her father was a central part of her life, providing the foundation of love that enabled her to express love to others. She was saved from the Holocaust by her mother who, with the aid of a brother who had befriended a US Vice Consul in Prague and another who was already living in New Jersey, arranged for visas for the family to come to the US in November 1938. Had this not happened, she might have joined her Czech girlfriends who, as she later learned, were among the first to be gassed at Auschwitz. Arriving in America as a poor refugee ""greener"" during the Depression, Alice turned a hard life into a good life. Prevented from pursuing a career as a teacher of English literature at Montclair State Teachers College because of her accent, she transferred to Indiana University Bloomington on a scholarship, participated in the 1953 Kinsey Study, worked to desegregate Bloomington, and found her true calling in psychology. She received a Ph.D. in experimental psychology from the New School for Social Research in 1959. Alice had two daughters with her first husband, Arthur Lasker: Roz Lasker, a physician, and Mimi Kaough, an attorney. In 1969, she married Dr. Haim Ginott, a prominent child psychologist who she met at a yahrzeit memorial celebration for the Yiddish author Sholem Aleichem. The couple worked closely together until Ginott's death from cancer in 1973. In 1986 she married Theodore Cohn, a management consultant who she met in New Delhi at a professional conference. For 40 years, Alice maintained an active practice as a psychotherapist and world- wide lecturer, bringing knowledge, intuition, sensitivity, pragmatism and compassion to her work. She wrote a weekly column on parenting for King Features, published in 70 international newspapers. In 2003, with Dr. H. Wallace Goddard, she revised Ginott's classic, Between Parent and Child, which has sold 250,000 copies in 18 languages. Alice loved to ice skate, ski cross-country, dance, listen to music, and converse. After visiting Auschwitz in 1992, she and her husband established the Alice Field Cohn Chair in Yiddish Studies at Indiana University to foster the continuity of Yiddish. Alice wished to be memorialized in the form of gifts to the Borns Jewish Studies Program (Alice Field Cohn Chair in Yiddish Studies), Indiana University, Goodbody Hall 326, 1011 East 3rd Street, Bloomington, IN 47405.

This was not surprising for a man who in 1938, at the age of 17 in order to escape from the Nazis after Kristallnacht, walked from Austria at night hiding in the woods during the day to find refuge in Belgium. After immigrating to the U.S. in 1940, he proudly served in the U.S. Army from 1942-1946 in the European Theater in Paris under General Eisenhower's command. He was reunited with his father Bernhard and brother Ernest at war's end, but his mother Roza perished in Auschwitz. Fred Nives was truly one of a kind. Larger than life, he was an avid sportsman with unstoppable energy. He relished his early ski adventures in Davos and then his chalet in Meribel, France. His love of athletics included tennis, swimming and his treadmill. He was a voracious reader, classical music concertgoer and opera lover, especially Wagner. In his youth, he piloted his plane from Paris all over Europe, and ran his boat along the French Riviera to the Greek Isles. As an accomplished horseman for 50 years, he and his beloved wife Donna rode in Hunter-Pace events. In events where he was not riding, Fred became an official timer at the finish lines. He was also the Treasurer of the Greenwich Riding and Trails Association. He was proud that the GRTA's budget was perfectly balanced while he was the treasurer. His wide circle of friends and family reveled in his contagious enthusiasm, keen intelligence and marvelous sense of humor. He graciously brought everybody together for many holidays and occasions. Always generously entertaining guests with his hilarious jokes, wonderful stories, choice bottles of wines and love of fine foods. He had a strong will, strong opinions and strong mind. A successful entrepreneur with a brilliant and decisive business mind, Mr. Nives started a foreign currency service business in the 1950's and then a consumer finance company which was sold in 1963 to become Sterling Bancorp in New York. An accomplished Wall Street investor with a seat on the New York Stock Exchange until 1969, he was a general partner in investment partnership Apollo Associates until 1974. He left Wall Street to start Omni Financial Corporation, a very successful consumer financial company, in the early 70's. He wanted to help military personnel obtain consumer loans because he remembered how difficult it was for him to obtain a loan to buy his first car after the war. But, the greatest accomplishment of his life was his marriage to his extraordinary and beautiful wife Donna. He met the love of his life at the age of 37 in New York City and they married shortly thereafter. They shared a love of animals, which became a big part of their life together. In addition to their equestrian activities, they founded the 30+ year old Animal Rescue Group ""Adopt-A- Dog"" located in Greenwich, CT and Armonk, NY. ""Fred and Donna also generously funded the Bronx Zoo's ""Fred and Donna Nives African Wild Dog Pavillion"" Their love of animals and each other was apparent to all their friends and family. Mr. Nives also was a longtime Board member of The Center for Hearing and Communication. Member of the Greenwich Riding & Trails Association, The Graduate Club of New Haven, The Stamford Yacht Club, Goldens Bridge Hounds, North Salem, New York and Fairfield County Hounds in Bridgewater, CT. Mr. Nives is survived by Donna Nives, Julie Nives Schwartzman, Dan and Zoe Schwartzman, Miriam and Marissa Nives, Vivian and Richard Van Buren, Annie, Jimmy, James and Nicholas Angellino. Funeral services will be held Monday, March 9 at 1:30pm at Temple Sholom, Greenwich Connecticut. In lieu of flowers, the family requests any donations be made to Adopt A Dog, 849 Lake Avenue, Greenwich, CT 06831 or Center for Hearing and Communication, 50 Broadway, New York, NY 10004."

2015-03-09T00:00:00Z,"HAMMERSTEIN MATHIAS-- Alice, the daughter of Oscar Hammerstein II and Myra Finn, died Thursday, February 26, at the age of 93. According to her daughter, Melinda Walsh, the cause was pneumonia. For many years, she was the Hammerstein family representative to The Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization, and continued to be the spokeswoman for her father's work. With the insight of having seen the original production of ""Show Boat"" in 1927, she addressed the cast of the musicals New York Philharmonic concert performance last fall during rehearsals. As a young woman, she worked for her father doing research on specific subjects to support her father's lyrics, becoming immersed in the tradition of the New England clambake for the song ""A Real Nice Clambake in Carousel."" The material presented to her father often far exceeded what was necessary, something she attributed to what she termed ""research poisoning"". The recipient of several ASCAP Awards, she was the lyricist and co-author of ""Babes In Toyland"", an adaptation of the Victor Herbert Operetta, and she also wrote English lyrics to Franz Lehar's ""The Merry Widow"" and Johann Strauss' ""A NightIn Venice"", all of which were presented in the repertory of the Light Opera of Manhattan (LOOM). She was also associated with conductor Thomas Scherman and his Little Orchestra Society, for whom she translated lyrics of the American premiere of Richard Strauss' ""Intermezzo"" and adapted Mozart's ""The Magic Flute"" for presentation by puppets, both of which were performed at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. With her late husband Philip Mathias, she wrote and produced a musical Centennial tribute to Jerome Kern, ""The Music Is Kern"", in 1985, and was proud of having hired the then-unknown Susan Stroman to direct it. She enjoyed a lively correspondence with her father from 1928 until his death in 1960, and carefully saved the letters, which were warm, chatty, encouraging, and sometimes stern. Oscar treasured his daughter's precocious and painstakingly detailed notes and they were returned to her upon his death. Over the years, she worked on a book that included all the letters, which she titled, ""From OH to AH."" Her hope to publish the book was cut short by her death. She was a mainstay for family and friends, always knowing where she stood and wasn't afraid to say so, and what she said was worth listening to. We will miss her cockeyed optimistic view of the world and the future. Predeceased by her husband Philip Mathias in 2006, Alice Hammerstein Mathias is survived by her children, Melinda Walsh of Bedford Hills, New York and Peter Mathias of Monroe, Connecticut, a step-sister, Susan Blanchard of Roxbury, Connecticut, four grandchildren and two great- granddaughters. 1/3"

Ezra was born in Brooklyn, New York, on June 29, 1924. The son of Polish immigrants, he began improvising at the piano at age four, and he began composing at age seven. He attended the Ethical Culture School, and then New York City's High School of Music and Art, where at the age of fifteen he performed his piano concerto with the school's orchestra. He served as a radio operator with the 69th Infantry Division during World War II from 1943 through 1946. While part of the army of occupation he wrote and conducted the ""Leipzig Symphony"".

While raising his family, Ezra resided in Teaneck, New Jersey, and later moved with Aimlee to New Haven, Connecticut. Summers were spent in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, composing, playing tennis, attending scientific lectures, and relaxing with family and friends. Laderman's compositions reflect a fusion between tonally based materials and nontonal elements. In addition to operatic and symphonic works, Laderman also wrote numerous chamber music, concertos, string quartets, solo instrumental pieces, and vocal works. His works included twelve string quartets, eleven concertos, and eight symphonies; six dramatic oratorios, music for dance, seven operas, and music for two Academy Award-winning films.

He held residencies at the Bennington Composers Conference, the American Academy in Rome, and at the Rockefeller Foundation at Bellagio. Among his numerous awards, Laderman received three Guggenheim Fellowships and the Prix de Rome. Ezra had a passion for life heard through his music and greatly appreciated by his family and many close friends. While he had many interests -he was an accomplished pianist, avid fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and dearly loved father and grandfather -the greatest passion of his life was his wife Aimlee, with whom he shared everything in a long and fulfilling life.

The family moved to Berkeley in 1961, where Lee founded Marsh Electric Co., a successful electrical contracting company, a union shop. Lee became a Bay Area leader in developing opportunities for minority contractors in the construction industry. Lee was the first President of the Jewish Community Center East Bay in the early 1980s and he and Dorothy have continued their support of the JCC East Bay since that time. Active in civic affairs, Lee served on the Berkeley Waterfront and Berkeley Planning City Commissions. An avid tennis player and lover of opera and literature, Lee stayed in good health well into his 90s. Moderation in all things, including moderation"" he would say.

2015-03-12T00:00:00Z,"GREEF--Charles Edwin ""Stormy"" widely regarded as one of the preeminent attorneys for community bankers in the country, lost his fierce fight against cancer on March 10, 2015 at home. He worked until the week before he died. He was beloved by clients and friends in the banking industry for 40 years. Stormy was a loyal partner and co-head of the Financial Institutions Corporate and Regulatory Team at Hunton & Williams in Dallas. He spoke regularly to the Independent Community Bankers of America and the Independent Bankers Association of Texas (IBAT). He sat on the IBAT Education Foundation Board of Directors and is the only lawyer ever selected to the IBAT ""Wall of Fame"" in Austin. Stormy mentored many young lawyers who credit their legal careers to his tutelage. He was born January 16, 1949 in Amarillo, TX in the middle of one of the largest blizzards ever recorded in the Midwest and promptly nicknamed ""Stormy"" by the hospital nurses. He graduated in 1967 from Tascosa High School in Amarillo where he played for the varsity golf team and attained the distinction of National Merit Scholar. Stormy flew to New Haven to begin his freshman year at Yale University, sight-unseen, from which he obtained his AB in Political Science in 1971. He served in the United States Naval Reserve 1971-79 as a Lt. J.G. in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. Stormy received his J.D. with Honors in 1974 from The University of Texas School of Law where he served as Associate Editor of Texas Law Review. His legal career began at Hunton & Williams in Richmond, VA. He returned to Texas to join Kendrick, Kendrick and Bradley and began to build a specialized practice in community banking. The firm merged with Jenkens & Gilchrist in 1976 and became the Dallas-based office of Hunton and Williams in 2007. Underneath his unassuming demeanor and pronounced West Texas accent was a creative genius with a brilliant legal mind. Stormy served his clients with unmatched dedication. He loved baseball, especially the Houston Astros, and coached his children's and wife's teams. His long-time love of Northeastern New Mexico began with summers at Philmont Scout Ranch in Cimarron. He and Holly enjoyed entertaining family and friends at their home in Taos. He loved to discuss current events and seldom missed the Wednesday ""Steak Night"" political debates at Lakewood Country Club with his buddies. He faithfully ushered for 25 years at St. Matthews Cathedral and advised the Cathedral's Endowment Fund. Stormy is survived by his wife of 35 years, Holly; daughter Brennan Blair (Michael) and grandchildren Lucy, Jack, Hank and Charlie Blair; son David; father-in-law Bill Huber; in-laws Hilda and Jimmy Brewer and Hugh and Dana Huber; nephew Matthew Brewer; niece Ashley Huber; many Brennanergin cousins in Chicago as well as Kilkenny and Tipperary counties in Ireland, including Denis, Eilis, Mairin and Geraldine; and step-sisters Nancy, Carol and Gara. The family would like to thank Pat Dials, his executive assistant of 38 years, as well as everyone at Hunton & Williams. Stormy will also be sorely missed by his beloved dog Ace. The family respectfully requests no flowers but that donations be made to: IBAT Education Foundation, 1700 Rio Grande, Suite 100, Austin TX 78701; The University of Texas School of Law, 727 East Dean Keeton Street, Austin, TX 78705 (indicate in memory of Charles Greef); the Capital Campaign at the Cathedral Church of St. Matthew or to Aberg Center for Literacy.

2015-03-13T00:00:00Z,"GREEF--Charles Edwin ""Stormy"" widely regarded as one of the preeminent attorneys for community bankers in the country, lost his fierce fight against cancer on March 10, 2015 at home. He worked until the week before he died. He was beloved by clients and friends in the banking industry for 40 years. Stormy was a loyal partner and co-head of the Financial Institutions Corporate and Regulatory Team at Hunton & Williams in Dallas. He spoke regularly to the Independent Community Bankers of America and the Independent Bankers Association of Texas (IBAT). He sat on the IBAT Education Foundation Board of Directors and is the only lawyer ever selected to the IBAT ""Wall of Fame"" in Austin. Stormy mentored many young lawyers who credit their legal careers to his tutelage. He was born January 16, 1949 in Amarillo, TX in the middle of one of the largest blizzards ever recorded in the Midwest and promptly nicknamed ""Stormy"" by the hospital nurses. He graduated in 1967 from Tascosa High School in Amarillo where he played for the varsity golf team and attained the distinction of National Merit Scholar. Stormy flew to New Haven to begin his freshman year at Yale University, sight-unseen, from which he obtained his AB in Political Science in 1971. He served in the United States Naval Reserve 1971-79 as a Lt. J.G. in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. Stormy received his J.D. with Honors in 1974 from The University of Texas School of Law where he served as Associate Editor of Texas Law Review. His legal career began at Hunton & Williams in Richmond, VA. He returned to Texas to join Kendrick, Kendrick and Bradley and began to build a specialized practice in community banking. The firm merged with Jenkens & Gilchrist in 1976 and became the Dallas-based office of Hunton and Williams in 2007. Underneath his unassuming demeanor and pronounced West Texas accent was a creative genius with a brilliant legal mind. Stormy served his clients with unmatched dedication. He loved baseball, especially the Houston Astros, and coached his children's and wife's teams. His long-time love of Northeastern New Mexico began with summers at Philmont Scout Ranch in Cimarron. He and Holly enjoyed entertaining family and friends at their home in Taos. He loved to discuss current events and seldom missed the Wednesday ""Steak Night"" political debates at Lakewood Country Club with his buddies. He faithfully ushered for 25 years at St. Matthews Cathedral and advised the Cathedral's Endowment Fund. Stormy is survived by his wife of 35 years, Holly; daughter Brennan Blair (Michael) and grandchildren Lucy, Jack, Hank and Charlie Blair; son David; father-in-law Bill Huber; in-laws Hilda and Jimmy Brewer and Hugh and Dana Huber; nephew Matthew Brewer; niece Ashley Huber; many Brennanergin cousins in Chicago as well as Kilkenny and Tipperary counties in Ireland, including Denis, Eilis, Mairin and Geraldine; and step-sisters Nancy, Carol and Gara. The family would like to thank Pat Dials, his executive assistant of 38 years, as well as everyone at Hunton & Williams. Stormy will also be sorely missed by his beloved dog Ace. The family respectfully requests no flowers but that donations be made to: IBAT Education Foundation, 1700 Rio Grande, Suite 100, Austin TX 78701; The University of Texas School of Law, 727 East Dean Keeton Street, Austin, TX 78705 (indicate in memory of Charles Greef); the Capital Campaign at the Cathedral Church of St. Matthew or to Aberg Center for Literacy.

Her eye for beauty taught her family to see all that is lovely in the world.

We loved her, appreciated her, always looked forward to her company, and will miss her more than words can say.

2015-03-13T00:00:00Z,"SALMANOWITZ--Harold, 92, at Naples, Florida, previously from Scarsdale and Armonk, NY. Born May 31, 1922 in New York City to Jules and Rachel Goldberg Salmanowitz, Harold grew up in Manhattan, Scarsdale and Geneva, Switzerland, attending Fieldston School and College Calvin before becoming a member of the 1944 class of Dartmouth College. Serving in WWII, Harold was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross for courage, heroism and devotion to duty in reviving and rescuing his tail gunner after their B-29 received a direct flak hit that opened a gaping hole in the fuselage during a bombing run over Kyushu, Japan. After the war, Harold (Bushy) married Betty Pollack of Brooklyn and went to work for Superintendence Company (now known as SGS) -- the world leader in inspection, verification, testing and certification -- founded by his father Jules and uncle Jacques Salmanowitz. After three years at the worldwide headquarters in Geneva, he returned to Superintendence Company in New York in 1948 and became its President in 1968. Harold moved to Naples, Florida in 1992 and with Betty (who predeceased him in 2005) traveled the world, enjoyed playing bridge and tennis, listened to Sunday Jazz Brunch and discovered country music and became an avid fan of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He is survived by his four children: Barbara Fassbind (widow of Alois) of Geneva, Switzerland; Richard (Elisabeth) of Jerusalem, Israel; John (Kathy) of Menlo Park, CA and David (Wipada) of Bangkok, Thailand. He is also survived by six grandchildren who knew him as Poppy - Rebecca, Joshua, Michael, Jennifer, Rachel and Natalie - and 10 great-grandchildren as well as his 100 year old sister Violet Klosty. Between his navigation on commercial flights, marginal notations correcting Goren's bridge manual and his love of options trading, he was a man with a system that was clearly his own. We will all fondly remember him for his kindness, even temper, quirkiness and being himself. 1/3"

She was a former treasurer of the New England Society in the City of New York, and she was a Director of the Off-the-Record (OTR) organization. She served on the board of her co-op apartment building for several years. Allison was an active Elder at Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, where she and her husband were married in 1993. She served on several committees there, including the Global Ministries Fellows Committee, and on two occasions, she traveled to Africa with her church. Allison traveled all over the world; she loved skiing in the Alps and the Rockies with her husband, Fred, and she enjoyed European trips with her sisters.
