1895-02-10T00:00:00Z,"All the letters on the servant question that have fallen under my eye have been from those fortunate ones who can boast large, and some even an enormous, income. It is not at all surprising that one and all can declare that they have never had any trouble with servants. Without intending rudeness, I think not one should plume herself on any exceptional house or home keeping efficiency."
1895-02-10T00:00:00Z,"Trilby came to town yesterday. She perhaps did not altogether realize Du Maurier's beautiful idea, but she approached it, and made a very pretty picture."

1895-02-10T00:00:00Z,"The Committee of Seventy is peculiarly fortunate in its efforts to provide adequate legislation for the reorganization of our public school system, or, rather, for the organization into a system of what is now as near chaos as anything actually working can be. The Committee of Seventy finds a great deal of its work already carefully done by an authoritative body and the results embodied in a full report and in a complete bill."
1895-02-10T00:00:00Z,"HARTFORD, Conn., Feb. 9. -- The Republican forces in this State have rapidly changed alignments since the new session of the General Assembly was begun a month ago.

1895-02-10T00:00:00Z,"The noblest of all the numerous offspring of the German Society of this city is the German Hospital and Dispensary of New-York. All the struggles a similar institution ever had to overcome were but insignificant in comparison with those of this deserving charity. Its early history is replete with vicissitudes, and but for the stubborn fight of a few enthusiastic toilers it must have been abandoned."

1895-02-10T00:00:00Z,"So far both houses of Congress seem blind to the duty imposed upon them by the financial situation and to the opportunity for serving the interests of the people which the Administration has secured for them. The President has provided for the security of the Treasury gold reserve, that is to say, for the stability of the currency, for some time to come."

There has been, of course, no evidence of any depression in value, but the dealings are not such as to indicate an adequate volume of business."
1895-02-10T00:00:00Z,The ethics of hospitality centre in the dining room. An open hospitality is unsatisfied until bread is broken with the guest.

1895-02-10T00:00:00Z,"LAKEWOOD, N.J., Feb. 9. -- Everything in the form of a sleigh finds favor these Winter days. Russian sleighs, with silver bells, hobnob with brilliant-colored high-backed sledges that show the early date of their manufacture chiefly in their substantial lines and build. Among the prominent persons who have enjoyed the well-packed snow the last week are the Rev. Dr. R. Heber Newton and Mrs. Newton of New-York, from the Laurel-in-the-Pines."

1895-02-10T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Sala has his critics absolutely at his mercy from the very beginning. There are many obvious things to be said about his book, but he has anticipated them. He is so frank and particular in stating and reiterating his own faults as a writer and the deficiencies of his autobiography that there is very little left for the most hostile reviewer to say on those heads without using quotations marks."

1895-02-24T00:00:00Z,"There is no doubt that the protection which used to be accorded to the market place from the earliest barbarian times has played an important, though not an exclusive, part in the emancipation of the mediaeval city. The early barbarians knew no trade within their village communities; they traded with strangers only, at certain definite spots, on certain determined days."

1895-02-24T00:00:00Z,"The Wheelmen's Bowling League Tournament is practically at an end, though several postponed games remain to be played.

1895-02-24T00:00:00Z,"The suggestion of a correspondent, recently made in The Times, of public night schools for advanced classes, has much merit and deserves careful study.

Even sensible persons of good taste have been unable to avoid it, because one cannot walk in the streets or ride on the elevated railroads without being confronted by young Mr. Beardsley's queer women, who are like nothing that ever was on earth, or ever shall be, we devoutly hope."
1895-02-24T00:00:00Z,"To the Italian everything is edible; it is a nation without a palate. It steeps a hare in fennel and eats salt with melons. The craze for devouring birds of all kinds is a species of fury from the Alps to Etna; they crunch the delicate bodies between their jaws with disgusting relish, and a lark represents to them a succulent morsel for the spit or pasty."
1895-02-24T00:00:00Z,"On one occasion Borrow was at a dinner party in company with Whewell -- both of them powerful men, and both of them, if report be true, having more than a superficial knowledge of the art of self-defense.

1895-02-24T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Pickwick's pleasant incident of finding the stone at Cobham, with the Bill Stumps inscription, was, I have always suspected, an actual incident that occurred during the year 1836 or 1837. He says, indeed, that it was submitted to the Royal Antiquarian Society -- or Society of Antiquaries.

1895-02-24T00:00:00Z,"It is not easy, with the knowledge that is to be had, to understand the strike of the electrical workers. They are an unusually intelligent body of men; their calling requires that; they ought not readily to be misled by rash or ambitious leaders, and it would seem as if they should see how very poor a time this is to enforce such demands as they have made by such means as they have adopted."

1895-02-24T00:00:00Z,"The cycling world has settled down once more to a routine existence.

Heber Newton's acknowledgment that the doctrine of the resurrection that he holds, if, indeed, he holds any, is opposed to the doctrine of the Church of which he is a minister will leave the prosecutors of his ""case"" a very easy task.

1895-06-02T00:00:00Z,"With the enormous outpouring of cycling enthusiasts on Decoration Day, the great and growing popularity of the sport and pastime was established beyond peradventure. Such throngs never gathered before. In this vicinity alone there were probably 100,000 spectators of cycling contests, and in other parts of the country the interest was just as widespread. All of which goes to show that 1895 will be the most prosperous year ever known to cycling."
1895-06-02T00:00:00Z,"Here are three queer stories by the author of ""Esther Waters,"" the reading of which suggests a number of questions. For instance: Why did the publishers accept these things, which are certainly not nice, and seem to have no serious purpose whatever?

1895-06-02T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, N. J., June 1. -- In the crowd of spectators were many wheelmen and wheelwomen from distant points.

1895-06-02T00:00:00Z,"Those writers who take every occasion to deplore the tendencies of the times, often without any basis for the complaints, are fond of crying about the crowding of the cities and filling of the slums by those who are lured away from the country. It seems to be a general impression that the country is fast becoming depopulated, while the slums and tenements are steadily filling up."
1895-06-02T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, June 1. -- The alterations on the Jubilee are well toward completion, and the boat is expected to be out by the middle of the month.

The law appears as an amendment to Section 19 of Chapter 378 of the Laws of 1892."
1895-06-02T00:00:00Z,"It seems strange that a week should have elapsed since the murder of the colored man Harris without the discovery of any clue tangible or promising enough to justify the police in holding any suspected person in custody. There have been several arrests, but every arrested person has been able to dispel the suspicion that attached to him."
1895-06-02T00:00:00Z,"The production of Miss D'Arville's new operetta at the Broadway Theatre was the only musical feature of the week which has just closed. There is little to be said about that production that has not been said already.

Furthermore, it must be admitted that the contents of these volumes, especially of the first, are presented with little literary skill."
1895-06-02T00:00:00Z,"Boonton, N.J., is a manufacturing town of considerable importance, situated well up on the crest of an elevated plain, affording a view of the surrounding country so extensive that on a clear day the church spires of Madison, ten miles away, can readily be distinguished.
