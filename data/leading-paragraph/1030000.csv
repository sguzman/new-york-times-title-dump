1903-01-13T00:00:00Z,The President seems to have been making the same kind of mistake in objecting to the selection of the strongest and most popular candidate for the vacant Senatorship from Utah that he has made in trying to force on two Southern communities local officials who were unacceptable to them.
1903-01-13T00:00:00Z,"There is evidently a ""combine"" in the Senate to defeat the treaty of reciprocity with Cuba. It is not a creditable association of honorable Senators for public purposes, but a more or less secret one of interested persons resorting to underhand methods for an unworthy end.

Most of the Democratic statesmen who have been interviewed recently about the party's candidate in 1904 have come out for Parker. The sentiment is by no means confined to those Democrats who have stood by the party merely for the sake of regularity, and care nothing for the Chicago and Kansas City platforms."

1903-01-13T00:00:00Z,"In the outside market yesterday price movements were confined to much narrower limits than during last week, when there were many wide fluctuations. Considerable irregularity was shown by the market, but on the whole the reactionary tendency proved stronger than the forces working for higher prices, and so a majority of the day's changes were on the side of declines."
1903-01-13T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, Jan. 12. -- Judge Andrew Kirkpatrick, in the United States Circuit Court, to-day modified his order of last week, making W. C. Prather of New York and J.

1903-01-13T00:00:00Z,"There was a decided falling off in the volume of speculation yesterday, and this was attended With a pretty general decline in prices.

1903-01-14T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Jan. 13. -- The money market is unchanged. The demand is large enough to prevent any pronounced accumulation.

John Bull's pantos very soon fit Jonathan. A little making-over of course is necessary. When Mr. Bluebeard turns up on Broadway, he is a sort of red white and Bluebeard."
1903-01-22T00:00:00Z,"Probably the plan of tucking into the bill for the Department of Commerce the ""publicity"" clause of the Knox Anti-Trust bill is the only one that stands any chance in the present session.
