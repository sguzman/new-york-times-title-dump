1990-06-15T00:00:00Z,"''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' speaks to the gleeful hell-raising monster in each of us, and it speaks with much more verve, cleverness and good humor than the film on which it is based. Add this to the very short list of sequels that neatly surpass their predecessors. ''Gremlins 2'' moves away from the sleepy small-town setting of the 1984 film, in the process shedding its fondness for movie references and taking on more personality of its own. Freed from the ''It's a Wonderful Life'' ambiance of Kingston Falls, it develops a more savvy, urban feeling and a faster pace. Another and more important alteration has to do with the gremlins themselves, who were often vicious and predatory in the earlier film but are a lot more playful this time. The new gremlins can also turn ugly, but what they most enjoy is throwing things, making colossal messes and playing practical jokes. They're a lot less like horror-film fixtures, and a lot more like mischief-loving children."

1990-06-17T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: There's a ubiquitous new accessory around. It's not what one might call fashion. It's not good-looking. It adds nothing to any outfit.

1990-06-17T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: In reference to the review of ''Guilty Conscience,'' (May 20) Leah D. Frank is inaccurate when she states that when Shakespeare had one of his characters state ''Let's kill all the lawyers,'' it was the corrupt, unethical lawyers he was referring to.

1990-06-17T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Yes. While there are many talented players in the upcoming college draft (Derrick Coleman, Dennis Scott, Gary Payton, etc.), there are no ''franchise players'' such as Patrick Ewing and David Robinson.

1990-06-17T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Julie Jordan Fleps and Laura Ledford often use thrift shop finds to inspire their Julie Laurie collection of dresses and sportswear.

1990-06-17T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The 1980's were the triumph of Upper America - an ostentatious celebration of wealth, the political ascendancy of the rich and a glorification of capitalism, free markets and finance. Not only did the concentration of wealth quietly intensify, but the sums involved took a megaleap. The definition of who's rich - and who's no longer rich - changed as radically during the Reagan era as it did during the great nouveaux-riches eras of the late 19th century and the 1920's, periods whose excesses preceded the great reformist upheavals of the Progressive era and the New"

1990-06-17T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE mood is changing in the Middle East. From the seaside cafes of Tel Aviv to the presidential palaces in Damascus and Baghdad - and in Jordan, in Egypt and in Libya as well - political discourse is no longer of the peace process.
