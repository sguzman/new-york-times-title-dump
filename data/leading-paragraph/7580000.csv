The newcomer Orgyen (Jamyang Lodro) is a die-hard fan who has his heart set on watching the World Cup. He tries to watch the match in a local village, but when he is thwarted he hatches a plan to rent a television for the monastery. The boy's nontraditional ideas and modern influences at first find resistance from Geko (Orgyen Tobgyal), an elder monk who prefers to keep the outside world outside. The film's director, Khyentse Norbu, has a lot to say about spiritualism and globalization in this, his first feature, which he also wrote. '' 'The Cup' has a quiet political urgency, as well as a luminous air of religious conviction,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times.

Jobs was not a musician, and opinions are mixed about whether the invention of iTunes will be good for the recording industry in the long run, but his mark on how music is distributed appears indelible, and so the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences has decided to give him a Grammy award in February. Jobs, who died on Oct. 5, will be given a Trustees Award, which honors ''outstanding contributions to the industry in a nonperforming capacity.''

2011-12-23T00:00:00Z,"Though the comedian Louis C. K. may not seem like the kind of guy who derives much joy from the holiday season - let alone anything else - Santa Claus has brought him an early Christmas gift. In an interview on Wednesday's broadcast of ''Late Night With Jimmy Fallon,'' Louis C. K. said he had grossed more than $1 million from his online comedy special, ''Louis C. K.: Live at the Beacon Theater,'' after 10 days on sale, and would be donating part of that money to charity. Having told Mr. Fallon that he'd never had $1 million all at once in his life, and then dismissing his electronically earned largess as ''a $5 impulse that 220,000 people had,'' Louis C. K. explained that he would use $250,000 to pay for the special (as he has said previously), spend another $250,000 in bonuses to people who work for him and give $280,000 to five charity organizations: Fistula Foundation, which works with women injured in childbirth; Green Chimneys which gives outdoor and animal therapies to children; charity: water, which provides clean drinking water; the Pablove Foundation, which sponsors pediatric cancer research; and Kiva, which provides small loans to people around the world. The remaining $220,000, Louis C. K. said, would go to himself, providing a colorful pantomime suggestion of the physical improvement he planned to purchase with the money."
2011-12-23T00:00:00Z,"The ''personhood amendment,'' granting legal rights to human embryos, might have seemed to be a political nonstarter after voters in Mississippi, arguably the most conservative and anti-abortion state in the nation, rejected such a proposal last month. But the idea has not faded in the Republican primaries. Mississippi voters said they thought twice about the proposal when they heard that it would not only ban virtually all abortions but also some forms of contraception like I.U.D.'s and morning-after pills, could hamper in-vitro fertilization clinics and could, doctors warned, discourage critical medical care for pregnant women. It has also caused a bitter split in the anti-abortion movement, with traditional leaders, including National Right to Life and the Roman Catholic bishops, opposed to the idea on strategic grounds, arguing that it would end in a legal debacle that only strengthens abortion rights."

Left tackle Chad Clifton (back) is easing his way back after missing two months; he has been limited in practice and is unlikely to play. The primary backup tackle, Derek Sherrod, is out for the season with a broken leg. Green Bay's injury situation became so dire in its loss to the Chiefs that T.J. Lang took snaps at right tackle, a position he had never played, even in practice. ""It's next guy up,"" Coach Mike McCarthy said of the injuries, which is all well and good, except that the next guy might be Jerry Kramer. Health problems on the line can easily become health problems for Aaron Rodgers, but the Bears have played so badly in the wake of the Jay Cutler-Matt Forte injuries that the Packers could put a cardboard Rodgers cutout in the pocket and it would make little difference."

2011-12-24T00:00:00Z,"Giants (7-7) at Jets (8-6) Saturday, 1 p.m. Line: Jets by 3 Eli Manning and Mark Sanchez are down in the dumps as Christmas Eve approaches. Fans are a little fed up with both. But can you imagine a world where neither of them had even been born? (That's your cue, Clarence.) The Giants enter this game with a 3-11 record. They are trying to build the franchise around quarterback/defensive tackle Jared Lorenzen. Tom Coughlin, fired long ago, is now a punctilious librarian who fines children for returning Dr. Seuss books two minutes early and blacks out all references to vampires and werewolves in the Twilight series - the resulting novels are only 600 words long but much improved. Without a younger brother for whom to set an example, Peyton Manning became an arrogant, underachieving jerk who hangs out on Ryan Leaf's couch playing Call of Duty. Riding a wave of popularity from going undefeated and winning the Super Bowl in 2007, Bill Belichick was appointed secretary of state, and Americans have been implanted with BeliChips that feed all of our thoughts and desires into a master computer that acquired a sentient personality indistinguishable from Tiki Barber's. With the playoffs far out of reach for both teams, coaches Eric Mangini and Jim Mora Jr. meet before kickoff on Saturday for a rousing duet of ''A Fairytale of New York'' by Kirsty MacColl and the Pogues. But the most frightening element of all in this alternate reality? Without Sanchez, Brett Favre is still the Jets quarterback. And he has his own basic cable network called Telefavro. So enjoy Manning and Sanchez, flaws and all, and take solace in the fact that one team's loss will be the other team's source of playoff hope. That's another way of saying that every time a bell rings, or a football skitters off the turf, an angel gets its wings. Pick: Giants"

In addition to an active private practice, Dr. Michal-Smith authored several books, served on a number of Boards, worked with a broad international network of professionals, and received several awards for his efforts in the field. A lifelong traveler, he reveled in the people, culture, craft, and commerce of many countries.

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Must have been nearly 20 years ago, and I was scheduled to give a noon poetry reading in Paterson, N.J. My host, the poet Maria Mazziotti Gillan, picked me up on a sunny September morning across from the big post office on Eighth Avenue, and through the tunnel to Jersey we went. It was then that Maria told me I was only half the show; the other half was a woman named Ruth Stone. I would get the same ''honorarium'' (we are so pretentious in the poetry world), so not to fret. I'd never heard of Ruth Stone, and I figured she was an upstart from the corps of 10,000 American poets younger and better than I. We stopped at a humble house deep in a civilized part of New Jersey. When Maria honked her horn, nothing happened, so I was dispatched to go to the door. An elderly woman answered. She seemed out of breath or nervous or both. (No, I've never had that effect on elderly women, or on younger ones either.) ''We're here to pick up Ruth Stone,'' I said. ''Is this her house?'' It was the right house, and the elderly woman I was speaking to -- actually she looked to be about my own age -- was Ruth Stone herself. ''I must finish dressing,'' she said. ''Have a seat.'' Up the stairs she went. I heard a door close, then another, then a toilet flush, and down the stairs she came, looking exactly as she did when she answered my knock. ''And who might you be?'' she said, knowing damn well who I was, and then she gave me a moment of her marvelous laughter. I realized later Ruth was neither out of breath nor nervous: she was excited to be giving a public poetry reading and to be paid for it. Excited to be finally honored for the work she'd done for decades in an America that rarely honors or pays its poets. The reading took place in a modest, filled-to-capacity room in what appeared to be a school building in downtown Paterson. The schedule called for me to read last, but I insisted that I go before Ruth, that we observe the rule of the alphabet. Really, I just wanted to get it over with before I became nervous. And I also knew that if Ruth read before me, I'd be busy plotting my own reading and unable to focus on her work."

But one train setup you won't see is a replica of the street-level freight line that plied the West Side from 1846 to 1941. The line killed and mutilated hundreds of people, and its path well earned the name Death Avenue. In 1846, what was then the Hudson River Railroad negotiated a charter with the city to run tracks on an irregular route down 10th and 11th Avenues to a freight terminal at Beach and Hudson Streets and then to a final stop at Chambers Street. The trains were sometimes several blocks long, interfering with crossing traffic. Pedestrian deaths along the way were fairly common. The New York Times reported at least one each in 1851, 1852, 1853, 1854 and 1855, describing one victim as ''shockingly mangled.''"

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"No gentle way to describe this one: Shannon Stone (b. 1971) died trying to catch a baseball for his 6-year-old son, Cooper. It got a lot of press; maybe you saw the footage. They were at a Texas Rangers game. There was a foul ball to left field in the second inning. Josh Hamilton, an outfielder, snagged it and tossed it to the fans. Stone reached over a railing to grab it, flipped out of the stands and fell 20 feet. He was 39, a firefighter, voted Fire Officer of the Year in his department in 2009. At his memorial service, the pastor said how close he was with Cooper, and said he was the only dad standing and crying with all the mothers as they dropped their kids off at kindergarten for the first time. And he loved taking his son to games. Just as his father took him, when Shannon was a boy. His parents, Al and SuZann, told the story of one game, when Shannon was 12 or 13, to Lisa Pollak. SuZann: Well, at that time the Rangers had a third-base player named Buddy Bell. And that was Shannon's very favorite player, just as Josh Hamilton is Cooper's player. We were pretty close behind home plate, if I'm not mistaken. Where we were sitting, Buddy Bell hit a foul ball, and it came back over --"

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Camille Paglia's review of Greil Marcus's book ''The Doors: A Lifetime of Listening to Five Mean Years'' (Dec. 4) attempts a dirty trick: praising the author in general (''an American original'') to make her demolition work seem evenhanded. Paglia chastises Marcus for using the Doors' music to ''veer away to some other subject -- Thomas Pynchon, Christian Slater, Wayne Wilson, Pop Art.'' Yet in the Marcus books Paglia cites approvingly -- ''Mystery Train'' and ''Lipstick Traces'' -- comparisons between disparate cultural figures are central to his imaginative thinking. She complains that Marcus's ''garrulous footnotes'' (again, features of ''Mystery Train'' and ''Lipstick Traces'' that inject energetic humor into his analyses) belong ''in the back.'' Marcus isn't an academic (a condition she praises as ''a rarity'' earlier in the review), so who cares where the footnotes are tucked?"

Mr. Weber has a passion for the kinds of stories that often don't appear in the mainstream media, and he tells them in full. You can find his books at bruceweber.com. I was particularly struck by his latest, ''Just Life,'' and an eight-part story about military bravery and homecomings. The rest of the book includes essays about the founding director of the Peace Corps, R. Sargent Shriver; an interview with the filmmakers D. A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, and various movie idols whose mugs and then some papered Mr. Weber's adolescent walls. And you can appreciate the connections between Hollywood he-men and soldiers.

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Robert Ettinger (b. 1918) is widely seen as the father of the cryonics movement, because he wrote one of its founding manifestos, the 1964 book ''Prospect of Immortality.'' He advocated freezing the dead, for revival someday when medical advances will be able to radically extend life. His son David explained to Ira Glass the procedure Ettinger's body underwent upon his death in July. 1. It was a tough time. I did more than I expected to because the hospice people said he had a couple weeks to live, and we didn't expect it so soon. We already had plenty of ice there; we already had the ice bath there. And in the last couple hours when it became apparent that it would happen more quickly, we were rushing to make sure everything was all in place. 2. The hospice nurse performed her examination and pronounced death very shortly after he stopped breathing. I placed his head in a cooling box with ice and icy water to immediately begin the cooling process. The quicker the cooling process can begin, the better; this limits deterioration. 3. Then he went into the ice bath, where there was ice both above and below him and cold water. A heart-lung machine was used. It presses on the sternum and keeps the heart pumping. This accelerates the cooling process, because it keeps the cooled blood circulating through the body, further cooling it. 4. The next step was to perfuse, and that was done at the funeral director's facility. The purpose of the perfusion is to replace the blood and water in the body with vitrification solutions. Without this, ice crystals could form and cause cellular damage. 5. The body was cooled down very slowly over five days. There's a computer-controlled cooling box which lowers the temperature in controlled amounts until it reaches liquid-nitrogen temperature. 6. My father, who said all of these things better than I can, said that ''being frozen is a terrible thing. The only thing worse is dying.''"

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Line them up side by side, the New York City Marathon victory photos: nine of them, 1978 to 1988, the most comic and elegant rebuke to generations of harrumphing athletic directors who insisted that no woman could safely run 26.2 miles. When Grete Waitz was born, in Norway in 1953, that was the received wisdom. Too exhausting, too competitive, too damaging to the delicate female organs, too . . . unwomanly. The year Waitz turned 13 in Oslo, as she was discovering track and cross-country and just how fast she might become, the Boston Marathon was infiltrated by a racer named Roberta Gibb, who had to run the most prestigious distance race in the United States by hiding behind a bush at the start and sneaking in. When Gibb crossed the finish line, her time -- 3:21 -- was unofficial. Her request for an entry form had been returned to her, along with a note explaining that the distance was too strenuous for a woman. As Waitz came of age, there was no shortage of confrontationalists in women's athletics. One of the most cherished stories in running is the one about a certain K. V. Switzer officially entering Boston in 1967, the year after Gibb ran it, and nearly being hauled off the course when officials discovered that the K stood for Kathrine. (The following day's newspapers ran photos of a teammate, her boyfriend, body-blocking an enraged race director as he tried to rip off Switzer's race number.) That was never Waitz's style. In 1978, the women-can't-marathon myth was beginning to fade; a few big races had gone coed, including Boston. There was even an international all-women's marathon. Waitz was a middle-distance star in Norway, not a marathoner, when Fred Lebow, the New York City Marathon founder, invited her to come join his race. It was assumed she'd run not as a serious competitor but as a rabbit, the speedy pacesetter who prods the others to glory and fades partway through."

He will be remembered for his generous spirit, sharp wit, and keen business acumen. Morton Pickman was born on December 5, 1913. He grew up in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn and obtained degrees from New York University School of Commerce and Brooklyn Law School. He fought in World War II as a member of the United States Army where he was awarded a Purple Heart for wounds received in action. From an early age, Mac worked with his father, Morris Pickman, developing and managing residential and commercial properties in Brooklyn and Queens Counties, New York. After the war, he re-joined his family's real estate business in Queens and assumed leadership after his father's death in 1960. Among the residential and commercial properties the Pickman organization developed are Forest Hills South (Forest Hills), Cunningham Heights (Hollis), Arrowbrook Gardens Apartments (Kew Gardens Hills), Briarwood Apartments (Briarwood), Lakeside Towers (Bayside), the Pickman Office Building (Forest Hills), and Franhill Shopping Center (Hollis), as well as other properties in Queens, Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Today, Pickman Realty Corporation manages numerous commercial buildings and cooperative apartment units in Queens, owned by various family members. Mac's philanthropic endeavors were extensive. Among his charitable activities, he was a major supporter and served as a trustee of the Museum of Jewish Heritage A Living Memorial to the Holocaust in New York City, where he established the Keeping History Center in memory of his parents, Fannie and Morris Pickman, along with funding numerous other programs and projects of the museum, including the Pickman Museum Shop. He was recently honored by the American Committee of the Weizmann Institute of Science in New York City, Palm Beach, and Rehovot, Israel, where he served on the ACWIS Board of Directors, was a member of the President's Circle and a member of the Weizmann Institute International Board of Directors. Mac was an active supporter of the Anti-Defamation League and established and headed The Pickman Foundation, which contributes to a variety of charitable Jewish causes. In addition to his wife, Mac is survived by his son James, and his wife Elizabeth, and daughters Patricia Spears, and her husband Richard, and Teresa Pickman, and five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. His grandchildren are Joseph Pickman, Christopher Friedman (Jennifer), Elizabeth Winchester (Christopher), John Siris (Susan), and Scott Spears (Lisa). In addition, he is survived by his wife Gladys' children, who viewed him as a father: Ellen Danetz, and her husband Stephen, and Steven Willner, and their children Mark Danetz (Julie), Lisa Danetz (Craig Smith), Adam Willner, and Meredith Willner, who, in turn, have six children. He is also survived by his sister Esther Ellman, his former wife and mother of his children Charlotte Pickman Gertz, and by his extended family and friends. Funeral services will be held on Tuesday, December 27 at 2pm, Temple Beth El, 333 SW 4th St., Boca Raton, Florida.

The inquiry was prompted by articles published in The New York Times in 2008 that described how the Pentagon, in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks, cultivated close ties with retired officers who worked as military analysts for television and radio networks. The articles also showed how military analysts affiliated with defense contractors sometimes used their special access to seek advantage in the competition for contracts. In response to the articles, the Pentagon suspended the program and members of Congress asked the Defense Department's inspector general to investigate."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Stacking boxes is not one of the more complex tasks that humans perform. We learn to do it as children, with alphabet blocks, Legos and the like. And yet for decades, the difficulty of stacking large boxes -- crates and containers -- was a major impediment to global trade. Merely moving one large container required painstaking work in which longshoremen attached and detached hooks to the corners of each container before moving on to the next one. They certainly could not repeat the process to stack containers many stories high. In the 1950s, a longtime trucking executive named Malcom McLean decided there had to be a better way, and he turned to Keith W. Tantlinger, an engineer at a truck-trailer manufacturer in Spokane, Wash., to solve the problem. Tantlinger developed a lock that connected to the corners of containers and that crane operators could mechanically open and close from their seats."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Ever since Peter Singer's ''Animal Liberation'' laid the groundwork for modern animal advocacy more than 35 years ago, it has been a central tenet of the movement that we go ethically astray when we let emotional proximity to humans and a handful of nonhuman species trump the obvious interests of other animals. Although animal rights proponents haven't always embraced Singer's brand of utilitarianism, they have generally followed his rejection of emotionalism, reserving particular scorn for the sentimentality that allows people to lavish money and attention on pets while happily eating cows and pigs -- mammals every bit as intelligent and capable of suffering as dogs and cats -- which lead tortured existences before arriving on our plates. In LOVING ANIMALS: Toward a New Animal Advocacy (University of Minnesota, $24.95), Kathy Rudy argues that such quarantining of emotion is a mistake. Instead, she writes, we ought to use our reciprocal emotional relationships with particular animals as the basis for a new advocacy, one that recognizes that humans are capable of loving animals and that some animals, at least, are capable of loving us back. A professor of ethics and women's studies at Duke University, Rudy counts herself among the ''border crossers'' -- humans who have especially ''intense emotional bonds with specific animals.'' And she believes these people have an important role to play in changing hearts and minds when it comes to the fair treatment of animals. Her book runs through the broad range of animal issues, from puppy mills to ethical eating to scientific research, showing how the introduction of emotion and affect might shift the debate on each topic."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"LILIEN--Charles ""Chuck"" E. 82, died Monday, December 12, 2011. He was born in Ohio, raised in Barrington, IL. Chuck graduated from The George Washington University in Washington D.C with a B.A. in Foreign Affairs and a M.A. in Government and Economic Policy, as a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. He served as a Foreign Service Officer in the Department of State in Maracaibo, Venezuela; Brussels, Belgium; and Washington D.C. Thereafter, he worked in international commercial banking for The Continental Illinois Bank and Trust Company of Chicago in Chicago, IL and Wells Fargo Bank International in New York; then in international investment banking for the First Boston Corporation at its New York Headquarters. Chuck is predeceased by his wife of 55 years, Barbara Fleming of Washington D.C.; son, John F. Lilien of Washington D.C.; and parents, Kazimir K. Lilien originally from Poland and Ruth E. Parker of Chicago, IL. He is survived by his daughter, Ann F. Singer of Northvale, NJ; granddaughter, Melissa Nazzaro and husband, Dennis Nazzaro of Huntington, MA; and grandson, Christopher Singer and wife, Dawn Singer of Henderson, NV. Chuck is also survived by his great-grandson, Dominic Nazzaro. Throughout his life, Chuck was active in many community and professional activities, including the Executive Committee of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, the Board of Directors of Association House (Chicago), the Advisory Board of the Council of the Americas (New York), the Committee on Foreign Commerce and Affairs of the New York Chamber of Commerce, the Board and Finance Committee of the Asheville Symphony Orchestra, the Board and Investment Committee of the UNCA Foundation (Asheville, NC) and the Endowment Committee of Warren Wilson College (Asheville, NC). Most notably, Chuck's passion for the performing arts resulted in his heartfelt work with the Asheville Area Center for the Performing Arts to fulfill their mission to build a state-of-the-art Performance Center in downtown Asheville. Although he did not survive to see this dream fully realized, Chuck's legacy and passion live on through this important project. His life-long commitment to volunteerism had a profound effect on so many lives. That commitment continues today through his family and friends. Chuck has chosen Washington D.C. as his final resting place. His ashes will be laid to rest in the family plot at The Congressional Cemetery in October 2012. Memorial donations can be made to The Performance Center in Asheville, PO Box 2745, Asheville, NC 28801 or by contacting 828-258-1850."

He was one of the finalists on NBC's ''Last Comic Standing'' and definitely stood out from the pack. He wasn't always the funniest, but there was something direct and heartfelt about him that made you root for him, and you could feel the weight of his personal story, always. He grew up tough in the Bronx. Had been addicted to heroin. Three months before his death, he spoke with his fellow comedian Marc Maron on the ''WTF'' podcast. With permission from DeStefano's family, we've edited and condensed the interview and replaced the words that can't be printed in a family newspaper. DeStefano: When I was 21, I found out I'm H.I.V. positive, O.K. I was diagnosed with H.I.V. That was 22 years ago, 23 years ago, and that's what changed my freakin' life.

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"The Ivy League, which is experiencing an athletic revival with several teams ranked nationally, is a doggedly atypical N.C.A.A. Division I sports conference. For starters, the eight members are virtual heretics in the landscape of American big-time college sports for fielding about 280 teams in 35 sports without athletic scholarships. The league also restricts activities like off-season practices, discourages weekday games and prohibits postseason play in football. But there is one thing the Ivy League does that truly sets it apart from its sporting brethren nationwide: it tracks and scrutinizes the finite, detailed academic credentials of every recruited athlete welcomed through the doors of the eight member institutions. And it has done so for more than 25 years -- creating a dossier of grades and test scores for more than 40,000 student-athletes."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"THE Oxford English Dictionary defines a pastiche as ''a medley of various ingredients; a hotchpotch, farrago, jumble.'' The word is derived from the 13th-century Latin ''pasticium,'' a savory Mediterranean pie filled with whatever is left over in the kitchen. A modern analogue, pastitsio, can be found at every Greek diner in the land. ''The Enchanted Island,'' which receives its premiere at the Metropolitan Opera on New Year's Eve and runs in repertory through Jan. 30, is called a pastiche. Another creative use of leftovers, it is a Franken-opera formed from the severed limbs of other operas. But these limbs boast high pedigrees, having been created by the likes of Handel and Vivaldi. And they are animated by Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch, the team that produced both the Met's much-admired ''Satyagraha'' and the Broadway crowd pleaser ''The Addams Family,'' and will be sung by stars including Joyce DiDonato, David Daniels and Plácido Domingo."

Watches have bulked up steadily since the ''Mad Men'' era, incrementally becoming brawnier, thicker and wide enough across to invite comparison to sundials. Particularly over the last decade, high-end watchmakers like Breitling, Franck Muller, IWC, Lange & Söhne, Omega and Panerai and even traditionally conservative companies like Cartier led the way with models offering ample quantities of what the industry refers to as ''wrist presence.''"

If he feels ''a little lump'' in his throat ''about all the beauty we're in the process of losing,'' think how monks in the late Middle Ages felt as large, beautifully illuminated manuscripts gave way to plain printed books. Yet we seem to have enjoyed and benefited from that form for just over 500 years, including, in time, large-format books with color plates. Perhaps something similar will happen in the digital world, in which fantastic art is already experiencing a renaissance."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"EARLY in Dee Rees's film ''Pariah'' it journeys into a Brooklyn strip club where scantily clad young black women gyrate to a sexy, foul-mouthed rap song. Lascivious customers leer, toss money and revel in their own unbridled lust. It is a scene that could have been in any of ''the hood movies'' that once proliferated or even a Tyler Perry melodrama in which Christian values would be affirmed after this bit of titillation. But in ''Pariah'' the gaze of desire doesn't emanate from predatory males but A.G.'s, that is aggressive lesbians, who, in a safe space where they enjoy the fellowship of peers, can be true to themselves. Other films have depicted this particular black alternative life (as did a couple of memorable characters in HBO's masterly series ''The Wire''), but no film made by a black lesbian about being a black lesbian has ever received the kind of attention showered on Ms. Rees's film. It was a major success at the Sundance Festival in January and, even before its limited release on Wednesday, has entered the conversation as a long shot Oscar contender courtesy of the aggressive folks at NBC Universal's specialty arm, Focus Features."

Born in Brooklyn, NY in 1930, Shapiro was graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School. He received his undergraduate degree in engineering from The City College of New York, where he was a president of Tau Beta Pi, the engineering honor society. Later, attending night school at Drexel University in Philadelphia, he completed a graduate degree in Mechanical Engineering. For 38 years, Shapiro worked in research and development at the Sharpless Corporation, later known as Pennwalt and Alfa Laval.

As spectators watched from across yellow police tape, the agents loaded an S.U.V. and a motorcycle emblazoned with decals onto a flatbed truck and took them away. The home that the F.B.I. and Treasury agents searched this month hardly stood out from others on the street, but its owner did.

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Loulou de la Falaise might have been the last great muse of the 20th century, but the term made her uneasy. Although she seldom offered journalists clues to her personality, much less her feelings about collaborating with Yves Saint Laurent for three decades, Falaise no doubt thought that she was at least his equal in taste and endurance and so deserved more than a flaky handle. Still, to look at photos of Louise Vava Lucia Henriette Le Bailly de la Falaise is to feel the extreme effect of a stylish life and to wonder about its source. She was born in London, the daughter of a French count and an English fashion plate. But more important than her genetic attributes -- she was long and lanky with reddish curly hair -- was the way she carried herself. She seemed to reveal the secret when she said: ''Being a tomboy helps a bit. Most of the great style icons are tomboys, or they don't admire themselves physically.'' And it's true: beginning with Coco Chanel, some of the greatest icons felt freer in a men's blazer. Falaise herself was dressed as a maharajah on her wedding day. Did she feel unfeminine, despite her celebrated looks? Perhaps. But her boyish style had a quality of revolt that may have owed something to her roots; her great-grandmother, Vavarina Pike, was said to scandalize the locals by going around in men's cardigans and fedoras."

Cars began to float alongside washing machines, computers, people. The incredible could occur. And then the tsunami seemed to wash away the last vain dream of the 20th century: the nuclear answer. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant went into meltdown and watched its poisons filter out to sea, and what remained is what we all must live with: the democratic rage of nature. No matter what we do, we cannot regulate how we are shaped by weather. We look for calm, but there is always an inevitability of storm. The images from Joplin, Mo., were pure with grief. A snowstorm paralyzed Tulsa, Okla. The Souris River shed more than a tear. The streets of Bangkok were almost apocalyptic during floods. There were droughts, earthquakes, wildfires scattering animals like dice. So, the question, then, is ancient: How with such rage shall beauty hold a plea?

''When you die, they should just bury you right here, under the boardwalk,'' she tells him in HURT MACHINE (Tyrus, $24.95; paper, $15.95), Reed Farrel Coleman's latest book in a series heavily saturated with local color. Since Prager has recently been told he has stomach cancer, that day may come sooner than Carmella thinks. But this stubborn old shamus is determined to do two things before his ashes are consigned to the sands of Coney Island: Attend his daughter's wedding, and find the person who murdered Carmella's older sister, Alta. Alta Conseco and Maya Watson, emergency medical technicians with the New York Fire Department, became pariahs after walking away from a dying man who was stricken at a trendy Manhattan bistro. Although Alta's death was clearly a retribution killing, her fellow E.M.T. (surely the murderer's next target) refuses to offer any explanation for their behavior. This silent treatment forces Prager to do exactly what we want him to do: Travel the length and breadth of the city talking to cops, firemen, gangsters and restaurateurs in their picturesque natural habitats."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"These days, artists like Drake, Akon, T-Pain and Cee-Lo Green slide back and forth between singing and rapping so casually that it's easy to forget that there was a time when performers who valued their cred weren't allowed to do both. The few rappers who dared to try it either treated singing like a joke or risked becoming one. So for about a decade, Nate Dogg -- who was born Nathaniel Dwayne Hale -- had a niche more or less to himself. He was a singer with a doleful, cognac-smooth baritone. But he had a rapper's feel for the pockets of a beat and a rapper's taste for unprintable vulgarity, and whenever a tough-guy rap song seemed to call for a melodic refrain, tough-guy rappers called for Nate Dogg. Before he was a gangsta, he was a Marine -- a munitions specialist. When he was 19, he came home and found his girlfriend in bed with his cousin. ''I pulled my weapon out,'' he told Vibe in 2001, ''and had a talk with them for two days. We cried together for two days, and then I let them go.'' He said the incident got him dishonorably discharged; he was then evicted from his mother's house. He reconnected with a high-school buddy, aspiring rapper Calvin Broadus Jr., soon to be known as Snoop Dogg, and Warren Griffin III, who went by Warren G. They started a rap group and sold drugs on the side to pay the bills until their break came."

Margherita Aloi, the daughter of a winemaker and farmer from a small town in the Piedmont region of Italy, who attended the Culinary Institute of Barolo, was chosen by the New York restaurateur Pino Luongo to cook at his new, wildly successful Manhattan restaurant, Le Madri. It was 1989 and she was just 18. Mr. Luongo had the novel idea of staffing Le Madri, which means ''the mothers,'' with a rotating cadre of Italian women, each cooking her regional specialty. The young Ms. Aloi was hired as the fresh-pasta maker. Twenty years later, Le Madri has closed, but Ms. Aloi has accumulated an impressive résumé. She stayed on at the restaurant past the three months that had been originally arranged, eventually attaining the position of executive chef. From there, she partnered with Chris Mazzilli to open Arezzo (now closed) in Chelsea, followed by Aloi restaurant in New Canaan. In 2010, in partnership with Robert Scinto, a real estate developer, she took the helm at Il Palio, in Shelton, as the executive chef."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"RADOM--Marjorie Roth (1912-2011). ""Midge"" was the first wife of playwright Edward Chodorov. She subsequently married Matthew Radom, USN Ret. who died in 2004. Family includes son Stephan Chodorov, daughter and son-in-law Ginger and Michael Montel, grandsons Pip Chodorov and Max Montel, sister Jessie Robinson and nieces, nephews and cousins. We will lift a glass in her memory at a later date."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Celebrating New Year's Eve in Las Vegas isn't a novel concept, but the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Las Vegas is offering a fresh way to ring in 2012. The hotel has scheduled three days of events, beginning on Dec. 30, that emphasize its musical roots. The hip-hop star Drake (above), the alternative singer Corey Taylor, the heavy metal band Guns N' Roses and a popular local band, Sin City Sinners, are all scheduled to perform. Also, the techno D.J. Robbie Rivera and the 'Jersey Shore' star Pauly D will be hosting parties at the Vanity nightclub, and there will be seven open bars throughout the property. In years past, the hotel's New Year's Eve entertainment consisted of one concert and one party at Vanity."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"WITH only a week left in 2011, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has a dubious distinction: its performance has been far worse than that of a basic basket of bonds in the last 12 years. But while betting on a large-cap stock index may not have paid off over that time, it would be wrong to assume that this has been the case for all sectors of the market. A quick glance at the numbers shows that the S.& P. 500 index of large domestic stocks has gone virtually nowhere since the technology bubble burst in 2000, while the Barclays United States aggregate bond index has returned more than 6 percent a year, on average."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"HIP-HOP is primarily a celebration of black masculinity. Sure, there have long been significant black female and white male figures, but the majority of the conversation in hip-hop is and has always been about the actions, thoughts, feelings and ethos of black men. But this hegemony cannot last forever. Eventually the throne will have to be shared. The world of hip-hop has some diversity: Eminem, Mac Miller and Nicki Minaj now; the Beastie Boys, Lauryn Hill and Missy Elliott in the past. We have respected rappers of South Asian descent: M.I.A. and Heems from Das Racist. But what about the American white woman? Could she ever rock the mic for real? The cosmology of American celebrity requires several blond white women be major planets at all times. From Marilyn Monroe to Madonna to Britney Spears to Paris Hilton to Lady Gaga, our culture refuses to allow a void in the job called America's Favorite Blonde. (Some might say the woman currently holding that office is Beyoncé.) Given that cultural law, how long will it be until some blonde -- or any white woman -- rises to fame through hip-hop? I daresay it's inescapable. I'm surprised it hasn't happened already. Well, it may happen soon. We now have a small movement of white female rappers who want to be taken seriously, including Iggy Azalea, Kreayshawn and K.Flay."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"WHEN Loren Munk began furtively filming New York City gallery and museum openings in 2006 -- ''working undercover,'' as he put it -- he was regularly kicked out by security guards and threatened with legal action for copyright infringement. Since then, however, Mr. Munk's camera has become a welcome guest, and using the alias James Kalm, he has uploaded more than 900 videos to his YouTube channels, the James Kalm Report and James Kalm Rough Cut, which have been viewed nearly two million times in total."

Gilpatric of Winchester, Massachusetts. She also leaves seven grandchildren, Christopher and Stephen Gilpatric, Jennifer Mayes, Marguerite Yao, and Camille, Chadbourne and Grayson Converse, and three great-grandchildren, Timothy and Benjamin Mayes, and Jack Gilpatric. Much loved and admired by many friends and colleagues. A private memorial will be held at a later date."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"The North River Mental Health Center on Chicago's Northwest side will not be closing, but Diana Bryant fears the closure of other centers citywide will affect her anyway. Ms. Bryant, 64, is worried that North River will not be able to manage the flood of new patients once the city closes six other centers."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Government soldiers opened fire on a giant demonstration in Yemen's capital on Saturday, killing at least nine protesters in the worst violence since President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to give up his post more than a month ago. The march, which activists said was peaceful, was to protest a deal granting Mr. Saleh immunity from prosecution for the killing of protesters."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"One crucial aspect of the lockout-shortened 2011-12 N.B.A. season will be the hectic 66-game pace. Which teams will have the legs to keep up, and which teams will be worn out? The only real point of reference is the 1998-99 season, cut to 50 games after a protracted lockout. The standings were in chaos, and a No. 8 seed (the Knicks) reached the N.B.A. finals."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"An article last Sunday about American subcompacts of the 1970s misidentified the author of a 1979 book, ''On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors.'' He is J. Patrick Wright -- not John Z. DeLorean, who was quoted extensively in the book."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"AN architectural historian with a penchant for railroad stations, David Naylor has been traveling by train since the 1970s. He described the view from a train as a sort of movie, a documentary on the history of a region. ''I would say that compared to the fragmented views out of car windows and the miniaturized views out of planes, the meditative view out of a train window is even better than television,'' he said. Here are excerpts from conversations with Mr. Naylor about why and where to ride the rails."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"IN the backyard, revelers gathered around a vat of boiling oil and counted down from 10. All eyes were on the 12-pound turkey, suspended by a rope. At ''One!'' the bird plunged into the fryer and everyone cheered. It was Dec. 25, 2010, and we were at Project Parlor, the bar my sister opened two years ago in Brooklyn. She had prepared a nondenominational feast for anti-holiday castaways and orphans with nowhere else to be. We ended up slouched around a battered piano like ne'er-do-wells in a Wild West honky-tonk, singing hoarse, half-drunken carols."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"ASKED to recall unforgettable moments from the year in theater, one writer after another for The New York Times suggested scenes from Jez Butterworth's ''Jerusalem,'' which won Mark Rylance a Tony Award for best actor last spring. Stipulated: ''Jerusalem'' was full of memorable moments. Stipulated: The Times's critics Ben Brantley and Charles Isherwood already named it among their Top 10 shows of the year. Further stipulated: No ''Jerusalem'' here. But much else to remember, some of it surfacing in the smallest and most offbeat of places."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"''WE ARE THE 99 PERCENT.'' It was so much beyond a local slogan: the louder it was spoken, the more it began to say. My job, my streets, my economy, my riot, my skin. Cities shook their souls out. The yearning went global. Some protesters poured gasoline into bottles and lighted the sky with fire. Others unfurled hammocks under light poles. The idea was to be seen, to be heard, to be tweeted. The year 2011 was an evanescent spectacle of anger. Every corner was a world, and every world had its corners. The bankers stood back, the corporations hushed a moment, the politicians held their breath, and the cops took out their pepper spray. It might have begun in Wisconsin, had its adolescence in Greece, and shattered the night in London, but it lost and won its innocence in Zuccotti Park. Suddenly, a tent had as much meaning as a tower. Kids from all over the country boiled collard greens in the courtyard of commerce. The city's bureaucrats tried frantically to barricade them in, or out -- nobody seemed sure which. The anger rolled all the way down to Wall Street and the markets shivered a moment. When cold weather kicked in, the tents began to disappear and the anger diffused, but the images remained, another sort of fire in flight."

Take last Saturday night, when more than 100 of his followers crowded into the narrow, windowless Glendale Baptist Church, which is squeezed between apartment buildings on West 128th Street."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"SOMETIMES there is a necessity for anniversaries, even for things that cannot be forgotten. The memorial services for 9/11 were remarkable for their grace and dignity. The falling water, beside the reflecting pools, spoke volumes. While the Republicans fumbled for their own sort of memory -- trying somehow to bring back the apparent ease of the Reagan years -- the rest of the country drove down a street of foreclosed homes. We were all, in some way, looking for a brand-new roof."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Several years ago, David Iole boarded a train in Chicago after work and ran into a friend who told him he looked as if he was high on drugs. ''We're talking, and he goes, 'Man, you look lit,' '' said the Navy veteran, who is now in his mid-40s and is a patient at the North River Mental Health Center. ''I took offense to what he said, because I don't do drugs.''"
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"By some miracle, you set aside a day to tackle that project you can't seem to finish in the office. You close the door, boot up your laptop, open the right file and . . . five minutes later catch yourself thinking about dinner. By 10 a.m., you're staring at the wall, even squinting at it between your fingertips. Is this day 50 hours long? Soon, you fall into a light, unsatisfying sleep and awake dizzy or with a pounding headache; all your limbs feel weighed down. At which point, most likely around noon, you commit a fatal error: leaving the room. I'll just garden for a bit, you tell yourself, or do a little charity work. Hmmm, I wonder if my friend Gregory is around? This probably strikes you as an extremely, even a uniquely, modern problem. Pick up an early medieval monastic text, however, and you will find extensive discussion of all the symptoms listed above, as well as a diagnosis. Acedia, also known as the ''noonday demon,'' appears again and again in the writings of the Desert Fathers from the fourth and fifth centuries. Wherever monks and nuns retreated into cells to labor and to meditate on matters spiritual, the illness struck."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"ARLINGTON, Tex. -- His right hand wrapped in a bandage, the Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo stood on the sideline looking like a prizefighter who had thrown his last punch. Romo's throwing hand had crashed into a Philadelphia Eagle's helmet shortly after the Giants had beaten the Jets, which actually rendered Saturday's result here meaningless. But Romo's injury was hardly irrelevant and the speculation about his health will only mount as the Giants and Cowboys prepare for next Sunday's showdown in New Jersey, with the winner claiming the N.F.C. East title."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"When Richard Geller(b. 1946)died, students put his catch phrase, ''Math is #1,'' all over Stuyvesant High School, in New York City, where he had taught. It was taped onto lockers. It was drawn on a couple of desks. It was handwritten on a T-shirt. In the classroom, Geller was passionate and intense and demanding. One student remembered her math grade was the lowest one on her report card, ''but it was a Geller grade, and it was the one I was most proud of.'' Geller could have retired a decade before he died, but he didn't want to. He was a math teacher through and through. This is an edited and condensed version of a speech Geller delivered at Stuyvesant's graduation in June 2011. He died four months later."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Robert Easton, a character actor turned accent coach to the stars, who transformed Drew Barrymore into Amy Fisher, Ben Kingsley into Meyer Lansky and Gregory Peck first into Josef Mengele and later into Abraham Lincoln, among other feats of articulatory alchemy, died on Dec. 16 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 81. His daughter, Heather Woodruff Perry, confirmed the death. Just weeks before he died, she said, her father was happily turning John Travolta into a Bosnian."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"THOSE WEREN'T JUST tank lights leaving the desert behind. That was the darkness of a nearly nine-year war made visible. The soldiers moved through the sandstorms, and landed back home in the United States to deal with the continuing legacy of American foreign policies. In 2011, Barack Obama's promises were finally beginning to find their way onto the front pages. A spectacular nighttime raid found Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The helicopters landed. The weight of the past was kicked up in the dust. Author of a decade of killing, Bin Laden had endpages that were quick and sharp. He was shot dead, buried at sea, and the White House held its breath: it sounded so much like a sigh of joy, exhausted and necessary. The soldiers continued their journeys: it was a big world they were returning to. The seven billionth baby was born, starting global discussions on issues of environment, health and technology. Europe teetered on the edge of ruin, stunned by even more economic philandering. In Norway the island of Utoya heard gunshots among the trees. Parts of Africa were dealing, yet again, with an almost impossible hunger and thirst. But stories and images are always new, no matter how old the theme. The surprise of the world is that it can still surprise us."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"The official restart of the Miami Heat begins on Sunday with far less noise than a year ago, when a team constructed on superstar intrigue evoked breathless predictions and sputtering vitriol in equal measure. Lest the legion of Heat haters forget, Miami fell only two games short of winning last season's N.B.A. championship. Now LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and a supporting cast are back, claiming that the new version is a stronger, a wiser and, yes, a better group after last season's lesson-learning."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Some of my cousins and I, who have more disposable income, enjoy fine wines. I take a ''treat'' bottle to holiday meals and several nice budget bottles. This holiday, I brought a $200 bottle, which a wine-enthusiast cousin praised. My brother, who knows nothing of wine, proceeded to drink half of it and exclaim, ''Tastes just like the $3 bottle to me.'' Is there a polite way to ask nonoenophiles to drink the less expensive wine and let the wine lovers enjoy the special bottles? Erin, Honolulu"
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"CHOCOLATE -- like fashion, wine and finance -- has become a complex cultural phenomenon. There is basic chocolate for the masses, artisanal chocolate for purists and avant-garde creations for connoisseurs. In Brussels, a polyglot city at the geographic and cultural crossroads of Europe, you get it all. The capital of Belgium may be known as the Capital of Europe, but it is also, at least as far as most chocolate aficionados are concerned, the World Capital of Chocolate. Ever since the Brussels chocolatier Jean Neuhaus invented the praline 100 years ago, the city has been at the forefront of the chocolate business. There are a million residents and some 500 chocolatiers, about one chocolatier for every 2,000 people. The average Belgian consumes over 15 pounds of chocolate each year, one of the highest rates in the world."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"An illustration on Dec. 11 showing ski trivia on a map of the United States included an incorrect comparison of the amount of snow that fell last season at Mount Baker, Wash., with the height of the Seattle Space Needle. The amount of snow was 857 inches -- not feet -- so therefore it did not tower over the 603-foot-tall Space Needle. (Mount Baker would have needed more than 6,300 more inches of snow just to reach the top of the famous landmark.)"
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"The painting is six feet tall, which is not so big in a gallery but gigantic in a house. Also it is of their mom. Sandra, Grace and John would tease her about it.

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"WHAT do you do after turning yourself into Julia Child, a bold, occasionally bossy woman who changed the way people think about food? You turn yourself into Margaret Thatcher, of course, an even bolder and bossier one, who changed the way people think about Britain. This is what Meryl Streep does in ''The Iron Lady,'' which opens Friday in New York. In yet another of her miraculous impersonations, which has already been nominated for a Golden Globe award, she seems even more Thatcher-like than Mrs. Thatcher, so that after the movie if you go back and look at photographs of Mrs. Thatcher in her prime, you can't help feeling that they're a little off. She no longer looks like herself. Sitting over tea recently at the Waldorf Astoria with Phyllida Lloyd, the film's director, Ms. Streep said that she had been hoping to make a movie about Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, and that Ms. Lloyd told her sarcastically, ''Yeah, that will pack them in.'' But when offered the role of Mrs. Thatcher, Ms. Streep didn't hesitate. ''You have to imagine yourself as a 62-year-old actress getting a phone call asking you to play the first female leader in the Western world elected on her own merits and not on the coattails of her husband,'' she said. ''To say, 'No, I'm not interested' would just be ridiculous. There is no other opportunity like it.''"
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Madonna was not careening around the outdoor skating rink at the Standard Hotel -- she's more likely to materialize upstairs at the Top of the Standard, the celebrity magnet formerly known as the Boom Boom Room -- but she and her ilk are well-represented on the piped-in soundtrack. On a recent Friday night, the mood was festive at the Kaffeeklatsch, the pop-up Alpine snack hut and rinkside cafe, at 848 Washington Street, where the shrieks of amateur skaters skidding, sliding and occasionally going boom, were also part of the entertainment. Admission is $12, rental skates are $3, heat lamps keep the crowd warm, and après-ski couture capped by furry hats is the prevalent attire. Grandma's hot chocolate is served with a twist: fortifying shots of bourbon, brandy, whiskey and whatnot -- Dutch courage for skittish skaters. IN THE SEATS Joshua Crouthamel, 31, an American freelance travel writer based in Sydney, Australia, and his partner, Kurt Fulepp, 27, an Aussie who does marketing for Bing, the Internet search engine, were on a weekend jaunt to experience ''New York Christmas kitsch.''

Among the officials there was Jang Song-taek, Mr. Kim's uncle and a vice chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission, whose role as the young successor's caretaker has been magnified during the transition. Mr. Jang, 65, in what was said to be his first public appearance in a military uniform on state television, wore a general's insignia."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"The Bible is the model for and subject of more art and thought than those of us who live within its influence, consciously or unconsciously, will ever know. Literatures are self-referential by nature, and even when references to Scripture in contemporary fiction and poetry are no more than ornamental or rhetorical -- indeed, even when they are unintentional -- they are still a natural consequence of the persistence of a powerful literary tradition. Biblical allusions can suggest a degree of seriousness or significance their context in a modern fiction does not always support. This is no cause for alarm. Every fiction is a leap in the dark, and a failed grasp at seriousness is to be respected for what it attempts. In any case, these references demonstrate that in the culture there is a well of special meaning to be drawn upon that can make an obscure death a martyrdom and a gesture of forgiveness an act of grace. Whatever the state of belief of a writer or reader, such resonances have meaning that is more than ornamental, since they acknowledge complexity of experience of a kind that is the substance of fiction."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"In 1961, the N.B.A. was a far cry from the corporate behemoth that finally opens play on Sunday after bickering for months over billions in revenue. The league was 15 years old but still trying to find its way in a landscape dominated by baseball, football, boxing and college sports. That season, the Philadelphia Warriors star Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points against the Knicks in Hershey, Pa., in front of barely 4,000 people, with no television crew, not even reporters from The Philadelphia Inquirer or any New York newspapers. The league seemed ripe for a challenge, and Abe Saperstein, the founder of the Harlem Globetrotters, was itching to give it one. He thought he had been promised the N.B.A.'s Los Angeles franchise only to see the Minneapolis Lakers go west and take his spot. So he formed the eight-team American Basketball League, with franchises from Hawaii to Philadelphia."

But in the same week, in this city, the reported sale of a penthouse in the same building, 15 Central Park West, for a record-shattering $88 million, to the 22-year-old daughter of a Russian oligarch, dwarfed the first deal and made all others seem rather ho-hum."

Both packages include a Tintin-themed gift, tickets to the Herge Museum, which highlights the work and life of Tintin's creator, Georges Remi (whose pen name was Herge), and a detailed map for a self-guided walking-tour to follow the escapades of Tintin, and his trusty dog companion Snowy, through the city. Stops include the daily flea market on the Place du Jeu de Balle, the setting of the film's opening scene."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"TO baby boomers of a certain age Donna Reed was a sunny-bright television fixture for eight seasons, the perfect mom -- at least according to the prevailing values of the day -- radiantly gliding down the staircase every week to answer the beckoning phone, its ringing augmented by an impossibly perky musical theme fittingly titled ''Happy Days.'' ''The Donna Reed Show'' is seldom rerun, hobbled by its black-and-white photography, but its eponymous star is still regularly beamed back to mind this time of year with broadcasts of ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' the beloved Frank Capra film in which she co-stars with Jimmy Stewart, reminding viewers of her soft-spoken, wholesome appeal. The long-unseenfourth season of the 1958-66 series was released this month on DVD (from MPI Home Video), making it available for the first time to a new generation of viewers and older ones eager to become reacquainted."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"WHITHER the hostess gown? Archaeological study of this now-defunct garment, popular from the 1930s to the 1970s (according to the Vintage Fashion Guild), reveals that the American lady of the house used to greet her dinner guests not in Lululemon yoga pants and a clammy tank top, but a billowing, brightly colored maxi-dress, often with a forgiving waistline, or no waistline -- sort of a cross between an evening formal and a bathrobe. The idea was to balance one's respect for and command of the occasion with the right to sprawl comfortably in one's living room on oversize lounging cushions, perhaps leaping up from time to time to rearrange the cheese straws. For hostess gowns had very little to do with actual cooking; indeed, many of the specimens that remain are downright fire hazards, with their tentlike sleeves."

Joan was born in Briarcliff Manor, NY, graduated Kenyon College in Gambier Ohio, and was married to her husband of 19 years John, with whom they share two children, Katie and Jack. Starting almost 35 years ago with Associated Merchandising Corporation in New York City, later with Department 56, Marshall Fields, and Macy's in Minneapolis, Joan helped design and develop Christmas trim for the retail industry. Joan's work took her around the globe many times, visiting artisans and manufacturers throughout Europe and the Far East, bringing the best of their work home for our holidays. Joan was preceded in death by her mother, Dorothy Dorn, and her father, John Lawrence McGailey.

''It is not a genius that is making art but the collaboration of many people,'' she declared this month, speaking in heavily accented English, as she strode into the atrium of the Museum of Modern Art. ''We should be grateful not to God for giving us our talent but to the people who support us.'' Ms. Ivekovic was attending -- along with Roxana Marcoci, the Modern's curator of photography, and a huge installation crew -- to the last details of her first American survey show, ''Sweet Violence,'' which opened at the museum last Sunday and runs through March 26. It gathers nearly 40 years' worth of work by the 62-year-old artist, starting with the videos, performances and photocollages that made her name in Europe in the early 1970s and extending to more recent projects like ''Women's House,'' a continuing series of multimedia works and events begun in 2002 in collaboration with women's rights groups around the world."

After leaving the monkhood and taking up work as a commercial painter, you would have found yourself as a young husband and father, on the precipice of that April day in 1975 when the Lon Nol regime fell to the jungle forces of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge. What follows is nearly incomprehensible: Millions are driven from their homes in a forced exodus from the cities; doctors, teachers and factory workers are summarily executed, as is anyone who wears glasses, speaks a foreign language or possesses a university degree. Money, religion, schools, sports, even love -- all abolished. Words like ''beauty,'' ''colorful'' and ''comfort'' are banned from the radio. The idea of happiness becomes anathema, as it is the supreme belief of Angkar -- the mysterious entity in charge -- that in order to purge individuality, the people must be made to suffer, and having suffered, will remain void of dreams and expectations. That is, without minds of their own, they'll be perfect revolutionary workers."

The story, frequently recycled, concerns a disgraced tabloid newspaperman (Fredric March) who sees a chance to regain the favor of his editor (Walter Connolly) when he comes across the story of Hazel Flagg (Carole Lombard), a worker in a New England watch factory who learns she has radium poisoning. He arranges for Hazel and her cuddly, Capraesque doctor (Charles Winninger) to visit New York, where her tragic tale (and superlative gams) makes her the toast of the town.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant went into meltdown and watched its poisons filter out to sea, and what remained is what we all must live with: the democratic rage of nature. No matter what we do, we cannot regulate how we are shaped by weather. We look for calm, but there is always an inevitability of storm. The images from Joplin, Mo., were pure with grief. A snowstorm paralyzed Tulsa, Okla. The Souris River shed more than a tear. The streets of Bangkok were almost apocalyptic during floods. There were droughts, earthquakes, wildfires scattering animals like dice. So, the question, then, is ancient: How with such rage shall beauty hold a plea?

Until they are finally recalled, many of these books will continue to lie on my shelves, where I have also stacked much of my lofty ambition along with them.

THE ACCIDENT, by Ismail Kadare. Translated by John Hodgson (Grove, $14.) The Albanian novelist turns his attention from the carnage of Balkan history to the carnage of failed romance. When a taxi runs off the road in Vienna under suspicious circumstances, killing an Albanian couple in the back seat, a lonely researcher tries to solve the case by reconstructing their final weeks."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Mariah McManus The eager tunefulness of Mariah McManus's music almost gets in the way. So does the crisp songwriting, which is judicious with word choice and emotional delivery. But Ms. McManus is more complex than all that on the beguiling ''Nice To Meet You'' (Catcher and Rye). That's largely because of her sweet voice, which is sometimes direct and clear, and sometimes works over syllables using an aggressive tongue (with faint flickers of Bjorkian strangeness amidst the Taylor Swiftish purity). But it's always deceptive, because so much of what Ms. McManus is concerned with on these songs is rough terrain. The words of ''Make It Right'' are almost naïve, but Ms. McManus sings them with gale force. And on ''Anyway'' she sounds petulant but is really deflated, singing, ''I knew that someday you'd be leaving/Just didn't know it'd be so soon'' with punch, as if trying to push air out through each syllable. It makes the moments when she's expressing true wonder all the more powerful, as on her new holiday EP, ''Christmas Forever,'' which has a jangly ''Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)'' and a breezy tease of an original, ''You & Me.''"

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"REIMAGINING EQUALITY Stories of Gender, Race, and Finding Home. By Anita Hill. Beacon, $25.95. At the end of the 19th century, Booker T. Washington condemned the one-room cabins housing a majority of the country's former slaves as ''the greatest embarrassment to the progress of the race.'' In his eyes, African-Americans could do little more to represent their preparedness for full participation in society than to set up house in a ''comfortable, tasty, framed cottage.'' Hill, a professor of social policy, law and women's studies at Brandeis, sees a similar connection between homeownership and full equality for black Americans: she eloquently recounts her family's journey ''from being property'' in antebellum Arkansas ''to owning property'' many years later in rural Oklahoma. But homeownership is just one of many factors that add up to true belonging in American society, she argues. Her book is a complex and at times confounding portrait of the ways in which black men and women have struggled to surmount myriad forms of injustice to own homes, and the social ills like gender discrimination and political exclusion that continue to imperil full equality even when that dream is attained. Hill says she began her research after revisiting the letters she had received in the years following her 1991 testimony in the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, letters that moved her ''to feel more at home in America.'' While saddled with a dense and sometimes befuddling conception of home, this ambitious book provides just as dignified and well intentioned a performance as the one she gave at those hearings."

A wave of protests struck Algeria, Egypt, Yemen, Jordan. Almost as soon as protesters in Cairo were being herded away from Tahrir Square, they were dancing at the news of Mubarak's resignation. Ruling families began to fall. Power-transfer treaties were brokered. Parliaments were dissolved. Monarchs locked their gates and boarded their windows. In Libya, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was ousted and killed. NATO planes streaked a sky so blue it seemed it to speak of other Septembers. Faces, too, were lit by a new blue light. It was the era of the revolution down through the wires: time was collapsed and geography shrunk by the use of social networking. The whole world was indeed watching, listening, e-mailing.

Foreman clubbed Frazier to the canvas eight times in less than seven rounds. Larry Holmes, knocked unconscious by Earnie Shavers with a straight right that might well have been the hardest punch of the decade, woke up, rose in time to beat the 10-count, defeated Shavers and held on to his title. In most weight classes of boxing, which has declined from mainstream to niche over the past half century, the golden age occurred sometime before 1960. But a last-gasp convergence of unmatched talent and TV exposure caused the heavyweights to peak late.

I remember that slim volume's revelatory power when I read it -- its generous, collegial style, more a talk with presumed equals than a textbook. I still have on my shelf the copy I used, a first edition. The pencil scratches seem to indicate I was figuring out what the hell I was doing. I was a self-taught programmer, and it was through Ritchie that I came to understand the layers of software that worked beneath the screens and printers and keyboards and mice. The newness of C's conception -- and the elegance of it -- was that the language was both ''high'' and ''low.'' Higher-level languages -- like Cobol and Fortran -- kept you out of the innards of the machine. ''Lower-level'' languages -- called ''assembler'' -- worked on only specific hardware.

Five actors, supported by a sound-effects man, deliver the lines of all the characters from the movie. Four are dressed in fashions suggesting that their characters live in the golden age of radio, almost certainly the 1940s. The fifth (Alex Moggridge) appears to be a 21st-century guy who has wandered into a dusty, deserted old radio studio and sees the others as ghosts.

Hundreds of readers commented on NYTimes.com, voicing outrage at helicopter parenting, government red tape and the very concept of pre-K. Here are some responses. WOW.

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Thierry Henry was in London two weeks ago to be honored as part of Arsenal's 125th anniversary celebrations. But could he be going back next month for a longer stay? Pressed, no doubt, by reporters eager for even the faintest whiff of a story heading into the January transfer window, Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger on Friday acknowledged that he would ''have to think about'' reacquiring Henry on a short-term loan. Robin van Persie has needed little help so far this season, but the addition of Henry -- at least for January and February -- would be good cover for the club while forwards Gervinho (Ivory Coast) and Marouane Chamakh (Morocco) are on national team duty at next month's African Cup of Nations."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In her review of Anka Muhlstein's ''Balzac's Omelette: A Delicious Tour of French Food and Culture With Honoré de Balzac'' (Dec. 4), Nancy Kline writes, ''It is Balzac, Muhlstein tells us, who first 'brought meals into literature, in all their diversity.' '' But, almost 1,800 years before Balzac, Trimalchio's feast, in Petronius's ''Satyricon'', is plenty diverse -- from sows' udders to dormice dipped in honey and sprinkled with poppy seeds to a cooked boar out of whose belly fly live birds. The pioneer foodie of French literature, three centuries before Balzac, was François Rabelais. Book 4 of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel,'' in which the Gastrolaters make culinary offerings to Gaster, the Lord of the Belly, provides a five-page epic menu that includes 100 varieties of salad, 20 sorts of tarts, and comfits in a hundred colors, as well as hedgehogs, porpoises and stuffed monkeys. Balzac's omelette might be savory, but Rabelais's gourmands can choose from ''eggs fried, buttered, poached, boiled, baked in the embers, fried in the pan, scrambled, whisked, &c.''"
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: David Orr, in his poetry column, provides a cogent overview of the old, but always worth asking, question of whether a poem is more than what can be paraphrased (''Ways of Saying,'' Dec. 11). He notes that this is not merely a two-sided argument, and shows that the debate is further complicated when a translator comes between the reader and the poet -- as is the case with the Spanish poet Luis de Góngora's long poem ''The Solitudes,'' translated by the masterly Edith Grossman. Just as translation of poetry is deemed by some to be impossible, using prose to explain poetry strikes many of us who are poets as foolhardy. But, ah, the nobility of the quest. I suspect Góngora and his shipwrecked young man would join me in toasting Orr: Salud y amor y tiempo para disfrutarlo. We have been fools once in our lives."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"In recent years, New Yorkers fortunate enough to indulge worries over domestic compensation have been besieged with more and more advice and debate every December -- from newspapers, magazines, parenting blogs, real-estate blogs -- on how much to tip the people who take care of our children, open our doors, adjust our radiators, park our Priuses. And yet there is little to suggest that this mountain of charts and bullet points has eased the tension. What economists cite as the vexing information asymmetries central to these transactions appear to have been rectified hardly at all. What this means is that even after you've rifled through the data and researched the gratuities administered by your neighbors and friends, you don't know what you don't know. Your superintendent could tell you what Mrs. Parsons in 5F gave him, but presumably he won't. And Mrs. Parsons, if you ask her, is likely to abstain from the truth."

He attended Harvard School in Los Angeles and became an Eagle Scout. In 2010, Don was awarded distinguished Eagle Scout buy the Boy Scouts of America. After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from Stanford University in 1955, Don joined the Air Force as a fighter pilot.

The Koll Company quickly grew into one of the leading real estate companies in southern California and has been responsible for the development of over 90 million square feet office, industrial and retail space in the last 50 years. He brought Jack Nicklaus championship golf courses to Los Cabos, Mexico, at his Palmilla and Cabo del Sol resort developments which was a major contribution to making Los Cabos a world class destination. He was an entrepreneur, a great family man and a mentor to literally dozens of people in commercial real estate throughout California and across the United States. He was Presidential appointee to the Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and the American Red Cross, and has served on the boards of CB Richard Ellis, Wells Fargo Bank, the Irvine Company, and Fidelity National Title.

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"MAHONEY--Margaret E.,a leader in American health care philanthropy, died on December 22, 2011, after a long illness. Mahoney was the first woman to head a major U.S. philanthropic foundation, becoming president of The Commonwealth Fund in New York City in 1980. Prior to her leadership of The Commonwealth Fund, she was a senior executive of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and of the Carnegie Corporation. She played a key role in the transition of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation from a family foundation to one of the largest U.S. foundations in the 1970s, and revitalized The Commonwealth Fund, which was founded in 1918 and today has assets of $680 million. In a career spanning more than four decades, Mahoney helped redefine and reenergize American health care philanthropy. Under her leadership, The Commonwealth Fund became a significant force for improving the delivery of health care, addressing the health care and developmental needs of vulnerable populations, and strengthening key health care institutions. Upon her retirement from The Commonwealth Fund in 1995, Mahoney worked with the Fund and others to create Healthy Steps for Young Children, a national initiative to encourage pediatricians to focus on developmental issues in the first three years of a child's life. Some 50 Healthy Steps practices are in operation around the country, and serve as models for integrating health care and social services needed by vulnerable children. A leader of American philanthropy from the late 1960s into the 1990s, Mahoney was noted as a talent spotter and for her willingness to take risks with promising, but yet unproven, health care professionals and researchers. A native of Nashville, Tennessee and a graduate of Vanderbilt University, Mahoney served as a Foreign Affairs Officer for the U.S. Department of State from 1946 to 1953 before entering the foundation field. She received honorary degrees from many colleges and universities including Smith College, Williams College, Brandeis University and the Medical College of Pennsylvania. She served on numerous non-profit boards including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Columbia University, the Alliance for Aging Research, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, the Dole Foundation, the New York Academy of Medicine, and the Dartmouth Medical School/Koop Institute Board of Overseers. She was a member of the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine, which she helped create in the 1970s."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Good sentences, the ebullient critic and novelist Wilfrid Sheed wrote in 1990, are sent into the air like a series of jazz licks. ''You noodle around with tempo and sound until you get the perfect fit for that particular song, and then, so long as you can sustain it, God is on your side and everything comes easily and even the waiters smile.'' Sheed made the waiters, and everyone else, smile on a regular basis throughout his five-decade career. He wrote some 20 books, from comic novels to an illness memoir, but his essays are where his solos still soar. His four collections -- ''The Morning After'' (1971), ''The Good Word and Other Words'' (1978), ''Essays in Disguise'' (1990) and ''Baseball and Lesser Sports'' (1991) -- deliver an electrical charge: they're learned, fearsome, timeless and funny.

After they talked about old acquaintances, Jack suddenly asked, ''Merce, when are you going to make something the public likes?'' Cunningham told that story deadpan, which was like him. But when he did so a month later at Zellerbach Hall in Berkeley, Calif., no further comment was needed. Minutes before, he and his dancers had received a huge ovation for the world premiere of his ''Biped.'' This was to be the most sensational, abundant and internationally acclaimed work of his old age, a cornucopia that kept suggesting images of death and transcendence, with choreography partly devised on a computer and with décor that used dazzling computer-generated imagery that he had choreographed. For the remaining 10 years of his life he was routinely (and rightly) hailed as the world's greatest living choreographer."

Cities shook their souls out. The yearning went global. Some protesters poured gasoline into bottles and lit the sky with fire. Others unfurled hammocks under light poles. The idea was to be seen, to be heard, to be tweeted. The year 2011 was an evanescent spectacle of anger. Every corner was a world, and every world had its corners. The bankers stood back, the corporations hushed a moment, the politicians held their breath, and the cops took out their pepper spray. It might have begun in Wisconsin, had its adolescence in Greece, and shattered the night in London, but it lost and won its innocence in Zuccotti Park. Suddenly, a tent had as much meaning as a tower. Kids from all over the country boiled collard greens in the courtyard of commerce. The city's bureaucrats tried frantically to barricade them in, or out -- nobody seemed sure which. The anger rolled all the way down to Wall Street and the markets shivered a moment. When cold weather kicked in, the tents began to disappear and the anger diffused, but the images remained, another sort of fire in flight."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Michael Wood's first three books about literature concerned a Frenchman (Stendhal), a Latin American (García Márquez) and a Russian emigrant to America (Nabokov). If this sounds like the start of a bar joke, it also confirms Wood's commitment to cultural diversity -- as does the fact that between Stendhal and García Márquez, he also found time for a book about film, ''America in the Movies.'' In a recent e-mail, Wood recalled that when Wilfrid Sheed reviewed that book in 1976, he ''said I had a grasshopper mind. It wasn't a compliment but it's not untrue, and one can make some sort of virtue even out of bad habits.'' In Wood's case, the virtue he has made of his restless imagination has been a career as an English professor spanning more than 40 years, including 16 so far in his current position at Princeton, and a sideline as a prolific reviewer of books and movies. ''I have favorite authors and directors -- Proust, Calvino, Kafka, Emily Brontë, Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Buñuel,'' he said, ''but among different literatures and media I tend to go by mood. If I feel like reading something inextricable I go to Mann or Musil, and if something quick and ironic to almost any French novel (even Proust is quick in his way). . . . What makes my imagination work, I guess, is always a question rather than an achievement. I like to say 'What?' rather than 'Ah, how lovely.' Have I got tired of topics? Not really, but then I keep moving among them, don't give them much of a chance to tire me.''"

When their kicker, Lawrence Tynes, pulled back the curtains, someone with the Jets came by to yank them over again. The Giants' anger endured late into the afternoon, when Brandon Jacobs got into a postgame verbal altercation with Rex Ryan, the Jets' coach. Jacobs said Ryan told him to shut up and that he responded by saying he would punch Ryan in the mouth."
2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"It was a plan conceived over a breakfast of bread and butter. Bernardo Bertolucci, the director of ''Last Tango in Paris,'' liked it, the assistant director liked it and so did the film's star, Marlon Brando. They left it to Brando to break the news to his young co-star, Maria Schneider. At the time, Schneider was 19, a runaway and a stoner with the bravado of a young woman who had been living on her own, modeling and acting, since she was 15. Brando was playing a grieving widower seeking solace in sex with a young woman whose name he didn't know. Schneider played that woman, Jeanne, in a role that called for extensive nudity and explicit scenes with Brando, a middle-aged man coming off a decadelong downhill slide. If Schneider had reservations about the part, she was too young to say so, and she had no one to say it for her. She had fled her mother, and barely knew her father, a well-regarded French actor named Daniel Gélin -- an old friend, it turned out, of Brando's."

2011-12-25T00:00:00Z,"My first reality-TV death -- the first that stung -- was Frankie, from ''The Real World.'' Some of you may remember the sister. Punk-goth from Wisconsin. Twenty-two, but seemed much younger: defensive and chirpy, suddenly happy or sleepy. Hair a deep chemical russet. She was a cutter, too; she cut herself with a kitchen knife. Her mother later identified this as her legacy, that she brought attention to cutting. Also, she was pathologically fearful of ships. If one came into sight (it was San Diego; they lived on water), her cast mates knew to throw a jacket over her head, to stop her seizing up. But Frankie's true identifying oddity on the show was that she had bad cystic fibrosis in her lungs. And would talk about how it was going to kill her soon, while chain-smoking clove cigarettes. She was a girl whose rage to live could vent itself only through the death wish. She was captivating in a way you somehow resented. When she died, I felt nothing but then thought about her for a long time. Reality TV is aging, and we who grew up with it and in some way grew up poisoned by it are aging, so it's unsurprising that reality-TV stars are dying. Still, 2011 marked some kind of crossing. Last year opened the door with perhaps the first real on-screen reality death scene, that of Capt. Phil Harris, hard-living skipper of a crab-fishing boat on ''The Deadliest Catch.'' He was felled by a stroke in his cabin, and died in the hospital days later, all of it captured, much of it shown, edited to a Shakespearean pitch. His two sons, who each worked on the ship, who worshiped and feared their father -- we saw their faces. The footage startles even in an age when the antics of people on these shows have at last become truly Roman."

The protests took hold in Tunisia in late 2010 after the street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire. The kindle caught and the spirit of his self-immolation lit a fuse across the region. A wave of protests struck Algeria, Egypt, Yemen, Jordan. Almost as soon as protesters in Cairo were being herded away from Tahrir Square, they were dancing at the news of Mubarak's resignation. Ruling families began to fall. Power-transfer treaties were brokered. Parliaments were dissolved. Monarchs locked their gates and boarded their windows. In Libya, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was ousted and killed. NATO planes streaked a sky so blue it seemed it to speak of other Septembers. Faces, too, were lit by a new blue light. It was the era of the revolution down through the wires: time was collapsed and geography shrunk by the use of social networking. The whole world was indeed watching, listening, e-mailing. Some in the media lost their lives for the art of the images that emerged -- the photographs didn't just capture singular moments, but they looked backward and forward at the same time, at what has happened, and what is yet to come. The light from the Arab Spring rose from the ground up; the hope is now that the darkness doesn't fall."

The startling findings show that merely providing an indigent defendant a lawyer, as the Constitution requires in felony cases, is not enough to secure justice.

Rena, 57, died from complications of a malignant brain tumor. Born on March 17, 1954, she was the only child of Anne Loewy Bass, a holocaust survivor, and Milton Bass, a garment business owner in Manhattan. She grew up in New York City, studying ballet with George Balanchine. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ended her career as a dancer, but her love of the arts endured. She attended Hofstra University and Rutgers University, earning a Master's degree in Arts in Education. In 1978, Rena married Scott Forman. They moved to Massachusetts in 1981 where she worked at the DeCordova Museum for two years. She began to photograph landscapes in 1978. Several of her hand-painted photographs were published in various treatises on the topic. She began shooting medium format black and white, gelatin silver, sepia-toned photographs in the late 1980's. She has been represented by the Bonni Benrubi Gallery and the Winston Wachter Fine Art gallery since 1991. Rena traveled the globe in search of inspiring landscapes. Her bodies of work include images from locales as diverse as the American Southwest, Turkey, Indonesia and Chilean Patagonia to Atlantic Canada, Iceland, Greenland and the Norwegian Archipelago of Svalbard. Her work has been shown and collected widely throughout the United States and Europe. It is imbued with the timeless atmosphere of diverse and endangered landscapes. She is survived by her dearest husband, Scott Forman, MD of Piermont, New York, two devoted daughters, Zaria of Brooklyn, Leila, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and her loving father, Milton Bass of Tamarac, Florida.

Long beloved in Europe, he is making his American big-screen debut in the 3-D animated film ''The Adventures of Tintin,'' which opened on Wednesday in the United States, two months after its debut overseas. The character sprung from the mind and pen of the Belgian illustrator Hergé in 1928 while he was working at a daily newspaper. Tintin, a boy journalist with an enterprising spirit and a trusty dog named Snowy, became the star of a series of ''Adventures of Tintin'' comic books that Hergé illustrated until his death in 1983. The character seemed an ideal match for the director Steven Spielberg, who said he saw much of himself in Tintin and sought to adapt his adventures into a feature film."

2011-12-26T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (Sundance) THE MORTIFIED SESSIONS In this series celebrities go through shoeboxes containing the most embarrassing artifacts of their awkward years: prom photos, diaries and love notes. This is the latest medium for Mortified, a project that began in the late '90s, in which celebrities' self-excoriation and poignant discoveries have taken forms like a stage show and a book written by David Nadelberg, ''Mortified: Real Words. Real People. Real Pathetic.'' The guests in this episode are Anthony Michael Hall (''The Breakfast Club,'' ''Sixteen Candles'') and Lea Thompson (''Back to the Future,'' above, with Mr. Nadelberg). They will explore some humiliating moments from their younger years, including the time Mikhail Baryshnikov called Ms. Thompson ''stocky.'' 8 A.M. (HBO2) CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (2002) This Steven Spielberg film tracks the exploits of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio, above), a con man who, by the time he was no more than 18, had persuaded people that he was a doctor, a lawyer and a pilot. He thinks he has struck gold when he discovers a way to forge paychecks and bilks Pan Am for millions. But the scam attracts the attention of an F.B.I. fraud investigator named Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). '' 'Catch Me' is the most charming of Mr. Spielberg's mature films, because is it so relaxed,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''Instead of trying to conjure fairy-tale magic, wring tears or insinuate a message, it is happy just to be its delicious, genially sophisticated self."

''It's like something from a Berenice Abbott photograph,'' said Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, whose agency oversees the newsstand since it sits at the southwest corner of Central Park. However, its days selling newspapers, magazines, lottery tickets, candy and soda have ended. It is now being transformed to serve as an office and shop for the Bike and Roll rental operation that's come to be a fixture in recent years at Columbus Circle."

2011-12-26T00:00:00Z,"YANOSIK--Joseph J.,77 years old, of Lloyd Harbor, NY, passed away on December 23, 2011 after a brave year-long battle with cancer. He died peacefully at his home surrounded by his loving family. Joe was born on September 30, 1934 in Yonkers, NY to Joseph Yanosik and Julia Fecisko. He met the love of his life, Marie LaGaccia, while they were both in their teens, and they married in 1958. Throughout school, Joe was a gifted athlete excelling in basketball and golf. Joe graduated from New York University in 1957 with a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering Eta Kappa Nu and soon became Chief Engineer at Litton Industries. In 1966, he founded his own company, Betatronix Inc., which he built into the nation's leading manufacturer of custom precision potentiometers. Betatronix became a critical supplier to the aerospace and defense industries, and was the recipient of several supplier awards from Raytheon, Hughes and NASA. Joe was a brilliant design engineer responsible for several innovations and patents in his specialized field of potentiometers. End products ranging from Sikorsky helicopters to NASA's Mars Rover all featured his designs. He literally wrote the book on outer space potentiometers, contributing to Space Vehicle Mechanisms and Design, the industry textbook. He loved his work, and chose not to retire until well into his seventies. Mr. Yanosik was a quiet-spoken yet hard-working man full of inner strength and perseverance. When Betatronix was completely destroyed by a fire in the late 70s, he rebuilt it from scratch into a multi-million dollar company. After running Betatronix as President for 40 years, Mr. Yanosik retired in 2007 and spent his remaining years playing golf and spending time with his family. Joe was a longtime member of the Huntington Crescent Club and the Loxahatchee Club in Jupiter, Florida, and he won their club championships many times over the years. Up to his final days, Joe displayed the warmth and humor that defined his personality. A true gentleman, he will be remembered by all who knew him as a wonderful human being.

Inspired in part by a trip the Sheen patriarch took with Mr. Estevez's son, Taylor, it's the story of the pilgrimage a father (Mr. Sheen) makes along the pilgrim road to Santiago de Compastella in Spain, after having his life jolted by the death of a wayward son (Mr. Estevez, in a cameo part; astute moviegoers may also recognize Yorick van Wageningen, who plays a gregarious Dutchman, as the social worker who menaces Rooney Mara in ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo''). But ''The Way'' is an unusual, highly personal film -- see if you can count the number of Estevezes in the credits -- and it was promoted in an unusual manner, with a bus tour of college towns and midsize cities, where father and son did Q. and A.'s."

One show will finish on a high note - Hugh Jackman will conclude his limited run on Sunday with roughly $14 million in ticket sales in just 10 weeks - while others will end at a loss. The $6 million flop ''Bonnie & Clyde'' will close Friday without recouping any of its money and ''The Addams Family'' will exit on Saturday without earning back all of its $16.5 million capitalization. The Kim Cattrall-led production of ''Private Lives'' is also shutting down on Saturday, five weeks earlier than planned because of weak tickets sales. Then, closing in January (always a slow-selling month), are the 2009 Tony Award winner for best musical, ''Billy Elliot''; the revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical ''Follies''; and the new play ''The Mountaintop,'' starring Samuel L. Jackson and Angela Bassett. A Broadway concert starring Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin also closes the piano next month."

2011-12-27T00:00:00Z,"Sometimes it's good news when a study's hypothesis is not proved. That was the case, certainly, with a new study of older runners, in which researchers assumed that athletes over 60 would be noticeably less efficient than their younger counterparts. For the experiment, published in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, researchers at the University of New Hampshire and other institutions recruited 51 competitive runners, ranging in age from 18 to 77. Each trained regularly and had placed in the top three in his or her age group in a local 5-kilometer or 10-kilometer road race. Their goal was to assess running economy, a measure of how much oxygen someone uses to run at a certain pace. Economical runners can continue at a given speed longer than inefficient striders, outdistancing them."
2011-12-27T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON -- When Representative Ed Pastor was first elected to Congress two decades ago, he was comfortably ensconced in the middle class. Mr. Pastor, a Democrat from Arizona, held $100,000 or so in savings accounts in the mid-1990s and had a retirement pension, but like many Americans, he also owed the banks nearly as much in loans. Today, Mr. Pastor, a miner's son and a former high school teacher, is a member of a not-so-exclusive club: Capitol Hill millionaires. That group has grown in recent years to include nearly half of all members of Congress -- 250 in all -- and the wealth gap between lawmakers and their constituents appears to be growing quickly, even as Congress debates unemployment benefits, possible cuts in food stamps and a ''millionaire's tax.''"

Accordingly my colleague Ben Brantley and I have assembled our lists. I generally prefer to keep my choices in alphabetical order. These lists are ornery things to put together in the first place, and somehow deciding which show is worthy of crowning the list feels artificial and often impossible. To begin with, comparing, say, a new musical with a Shakespeare revival, and then ranking one above the other, is an absurdity.

The diverse exercise-related experiments published in 2011 and covered in this space each week suggest that it's possible to retain your cognitive powers, muscle mass, running speed and waistline, even as you age, and that a little exercise can go a long way in terms of physiological benefit. Recent, important science even tells us that coffee, chocolate and beer enhance exercise performance, which is fortunate, since I have no plans to give up any of those. As most of us prepare our exercise resolutions for 2012, now seems an ideal time to review the past year in fitness science and the lessons it contained, both encouraging and cautionary."

2011-12-28T00:00:00Z,"To look at N.F.L. owners and league executives that night in late July was to be reminded of emergency room doctors who had just resuscitated a patient, but were still not sure he would survive. The lockout had consumed every moment of the off-season, sending owners and players into mediators' offices and federal judges' courtrooms, riding in a never-ending caravan of black sport utility vehicles to the next staredown. On that day, at a hotel near the Atlanta airport, the owners had finally approved -- 31-0, with the Oakland Raiders abstaining in one final act of defiance before their owner, Al Davis, died less than three months later -- a collective bargaining agreement that would ensure the season starting on time and assure a decade of labor peace. One problem remained: the players had not seen the final deal, and some of them felt strong-armed. The players announced they would not vote on the deal that night. For a few hours, as owners raced for the airport and reporters took up spots at the hotel bar -- it offered the best vantage point to catch the owners coming and going, really -- the N.F.L. was in a bizarre state of limbo, waiting to exhale except for that very real whiff of chaos wafting through the air."

2011-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Get ready for some Democrat-on-Democrat infighting in New Jersey. Representative Steve Rothman, a Democrat whose 9th District has been upended by redistricting, will face off against a fellow Democrat, Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., who currently represents the state's 8th District. Under the newly configured districts, Mr. Rothman's home town of Fair Lawn was plopped into the redrawn 5th District, currently held by Representative Scott Garrett, a Republican and one of the more conservative members of the House. The new district favors Republicans and would have offered an uphill race for Mr. Rothman. So he will move, and run against Mr. Pascrell in the new 9th District, creating the latest House battle between incumbents of the same party, a natural outgrowth of redistricting, which occurs every 10 years. There are roughly a dozen such races around the country, divided almost equally among incumbent Republican and Democrats."

2011-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The reunion they said would never happen, already happened once before but didn't happen in time for a Grammy Awards nomination concert, appears to be happening (again). The classic lineup of Van Halen, including David Lee Roth and the brothers Eddie and Alex Van Halen, and what remains of their colossal 1980s-era hair looked as if they were poised to regroup for a new concert tour after the appearance of videos that were posted on the band's Web site, www.van-halen.com. The black-and-white segments, set to parts of the Van Halen songs ''Jump,''''Panama'' and ''Hot For Teacher,'' show the bandmates rehearsing and goofing around while a ticker on the bottom of the screen reads: ''Van Halen on Tour 2012'' and ''First tickets on sale Jan. 10.'' No other information was immediately available. Van Halen replaced Mr. Roth with Sammy Hagar after the release of its album ''1984'' and spent the next 25 years in an on-and-off feud with him. Still, the group and Mr. Roth have made a couple of attempts at reuniting, most recently in a tour that ran in 2007 and 2008. The Recording Academy, which organizes the Grammy Awards, made veiled promises this year of a band reunion that would take place at its Nov. 30 nomination announcement concert; some tea-leaf readers believed that the academy's clues pointed to Van Halen while others thought they indicated the Beach Boys, but no reunion materialized on the Grammys show. (The Beach Boys announced they were getting back together a couple of weeks later.)"

Most of the books were published in the last 10 years, and all are titles from the various imprints of Random House by authors like Lidia Bastianich, Bobby Flay, Martha Stewart, Tom Colicchio and Alice Waters. The Web site offers a chance to see a preview of each book, lets purchasers add the book to their personal recipe box (which is available free on the Epicurious site), or send the book to someone else. The books are also sold on tastebook.com for input into a mobile device, but for the recipe box it is necessary to access the Epicurious Web site."

With the team well on its way to a fifth straight win, wide receiver Johnny Knox slipped at the San Diego 20-yard line, and the pass that was thrown his way -- a quick slant based entirely on timing and trust -- was instead intercepted by Chargers cornerback Antoine Cason. The play occurred late in the fourth quarter, and while it was inconsequential to the game's outcome, quarterback Jay Cutler broke the thumb on his throwing hand while attempting to prevent the interception return for a touchdown by taking on Cason's lead blocker. For a Bears fan (a k a me), the news seemed utterly catastrophic. ''The season is over!'' was the initial lament."

While most would prefer not to experience the sound firsthand, it is one that has been imagined and portrayed cinematically in several ways, from a whimper (Sidney Lumet's ''Fail-Safe'') to a bang (the 1983 TV movie ''The Day After,'' which didn't depict the end of everything, exactly, but did portray the unthinkable). Lars von Trier's ''Melancholia,'' the apocalyptic drama that has received as much critical praise as its director has received public scrutiny, chooses to end the world with Wagner. The prelude to Richard Wagner's opera ''Tristan and Isolde'' guides audiences through many of the film's darkest and brightest moments. And the sound designer Kristian Eidnes Andersen, who also worked with Mr. von Trier on ''Antichrist,'' uses his understanding of music composition to bring those sounds to the height of emotional impact."

Deeply loved by her family and cherished by her many friends around the world, she is survived by her husband of seventeen years, Stephen M. DuBrul, Jr.; and by her nieces, Ellen Iseman and Beverly Ross, and four nephews, Peter Iseman, Fred Iseman, Alfred Ross, and Clifford Ross. She is also survived by two stepdaughters, Lise Motherwell and Jeannie Motherwell, from her first marriage, to the artist Robert Motherwell, and by two stepchildren, Jennifer DuBrul and Nicholas DuBrul, as well as three grandnephews, two grandnieces, four step-granddaughters, two step-great-grandsons, and one step-great-granddaughter. Helen Frankenthaler was born in Manhattan in 1928, the third daughter of New York State Supreme Court Judge Alfred Frankenthaler and Martha Lowenstein Frankenthaler. Her sisters, Marjorie Frankenthaler Iseman and Gloria Frankenthaler Ross Bookman, predeceased her. Helen Frankenthaler graduated from The Dalton School, having attended The Brearley School and The Horace Mann School. A 1949 graduate of Bennington College, she served as a member of the College's Board of Trustees from 1967 to 1982. She was the recipient of twenty-six honorary degrees, as well as other notable honors, including the National Medal of the Arts, in 2001. Most recently, she was appointed as an Honorary Academician of the Royal Academy of Arts, London in 2011. From 1985 to 1992, she was a member of the National Council on the Arts, part of the National Endowment for the Arts. A perfectionist and planner to the end, she made clear her wish to be buried at her alma mater, Bennington College, in Vermont, where a private ceremony will be held. A memorial service in New York City will be announced in the weeks ahead. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her memory to Bennington College or Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City. Helen was a family treasure, a national treasure, and will be forever missed by those who knew her well and by a public who admired her vibrant works of art. In her career she was an original, brilliant, energetic, witty presence who shone brightly in our firmament. With her passing, her world and her family are left with a deep void and diminished color."

Bloomberg's annual interfaith breakfast on Friday to protest what it calls the unfair surveillance of Muslims by the New York Police Department. In a letter sent to Mr. Bloomberg on Wednesday, 14 Muslim leaders said they would not attend the breakfast because of what they described as ''very disturbing revelations'' about the city's treatment of Muslim New Yorkers. They were referring to a series of articles released by The Associated Press beginning in August that detailed the use of undercover officers and informants to gather and maintain information about political activity among Muslims in circumstances in which there was no indication that crimes had occurred."

2011-12-29T00:00:00Z,"ROME -- Italian archaeology officials on Wednesday played down Italian news reports that chunks of masonry had been falling off the Colosseum. ''Nothing has collapsed'' at the Colosseum ''since the 18th century,'' said a statement issued by a department of the Culture Ministry responsible for Rome's archaeological sites. The Colosseum, the first-century A.D. arena, is Italy's most popular tourist draw. The statement was issued after culture ministry officials used a crane to peruse up close an area of the massive structure where bits of plaster were said to have detached and fallen on Tuesday, according to news reports. On Christmas Day tourists found small fragments of tufo, the porous rock typical of ancient Roman monuments, on the ground. Anna Maria Moretti, the official responsible for the ancient sites, denied that any material had fallen Tuesday and noted that the tufo that detached on Dec. 25 came from a patch smaller than ''five centimeters.''"

The game took only 40 minutes on the clock, but more than 40 years on the calendar of cultural acceptance. In a feverish, engaging game, Texas A&M's press was smothering and its Barkley-esque forward Danielle Adams was unstoppable inside and out, with 30 points and 9 rebounds in a 76-70 victory over Notre Dame.

The Dyson Hot creates a column of warm air that can be sent in various directions thanks to its tilting and oscillating base. The end result, Dyson says, is a heater that has no external moving parts like spinning blades and can run almost half as hot as conventional models while still providing the same or better output.

This is not just because the new production has come thundering into town after its Boston tryout, trailing a boldface-name-inspired controversy. Most theater watchers will be aware that proposed changes to the original book inflamed the sensibilities of no less a musical-theater master than Stephen Sondheim, prompting a letter of protest to The New York Times. But the production, directed by Diane Paulus (''Hair''), would be important even without the mild media tempest inspired by Mr. Sondheim's letter. The music and lyrics, by George and Ira Gershwin and DuBose and Dorothy Heyward, are considered by most authorities (Mr. Sondheim included) to be among the greatest ever heard on Broadway."

DuBrul, Jr.; and by her nieces, Ellen Iseman and Beverly Ross, and four nephews, Peter Iseman, Fred Iseman, Alfred Ross, and Clifford Ross.

(Showtime) THE COMPANY MEN (2010) Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones (above left, with Mr. Affleck) and Chris Cooper portray mid- to high-level employees at a fictional Boston company confronting sudden corporate downsizing -- the better to justify the chief executive's $22 million salary on the eve of a probable merger. ''Some of the details are wrong,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times of this feature-film directing debut from John Wells. ''Yet the minor miscalculations pale beside the film's unflinching depiction of the perils of heedless upward mobility that, for all the luxuries it affords, looks pretty grim.'' Playing an employee who rose from the factory floor to an executive suite across 30 years, Mr. Cooper, he added, ''gives a great, tragic performance of a man who lashes out like a trapped snake when he realizes that, in his words, 'my life ended, and nobody noticed.' '' 7 A.M.

In other words, he has lost his edge. Then, at the suggestion of Jack (Jeff Bridges), a much more stellar writer, Steven takes on a muse (Sharon Stone) named Sarah.

2011-12-30T00:00:00Z,"New TV shows are liable to pop up any time these days, but over the last few years January has solidified its position as the start of television's second season. There are probably more series making their debuts or having their season premieres next month than there were during the official start of the 2011-12 broadcast network season in September. A quick scan turns up more than 70. The January premieres are a motley, cable-dominated bunch, including a reality show about taxidermy and the fifth season of ''Jersey Shore.'' But that also makes them a more vibrant collection than the fall's dire crop of new and returning network shows. And there are a few high-toned productions sprinkled in, like the new season of ''Downton Abbey'' and Dustin Hoffman's first appearance as a TV-series regular in HBO's ''Luck.''"

United States District Judge Katherine Forrest threw out on Wednesday the four-year-old claims by ruling that Gary Friedrich, a freelance writer, gave up all ownership rights when he signed checks including language-relinquishing rights to the predecessor companies of Marvel Entertainment. ''The law is clear that when an individual endorses a check subject to a condition, he accepts that condition,'' she wrote. On his MySpace page, Mr. Friedrich sets up a distinction between the comic book appearances by Ghost Rider and his use in other media, including a film starring Nicolas Cage in 2007.

By experimenting with the qualities of paint and canvas, she was able to create, in her own words, ""explosive landscapes, worlds and distances, held on a flat surface."" Frankenthaler's work was first shown at the Whitney in 1955 and has subsequently been included in over 40 exhibitions at the Museum. A mid-career retrospective of her work was organized by the Whitney in 1969. The Museum is also proud to hold close to a dozen works in our permanent collection; the first of which, Blue Territory, was acquired from the 1955 Annual.

''The art market is a place for new people these days,'' Christophe Van de Weghe, a New York dealer, was quoted as saying.

Zuccotti; Christy Ferer, founder and chief executive of the Vidicom video company; Julie Menin, chairwoman of Community Board 1; and Zenia Mucha, executive vice president of the Walt Disney Company. Joseph C. Daniels, president of the Sept. 11 foundation, added that Patricia E. Harris, the first deputy mayor, would serve as an ex-officio member representing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Naming a board was a prerequisite for tapping into $100 million that the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation had set aside for the center, which is to be designed by Frank Gehry. Even though the deadline was the end of this year, the naming of the board members, like other issues related to the World Trade Center site, including financing for the Sept. 11 museum, had been held up by tension between Mayor Bloomberg and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The governor still has the option of naming someone to the board."

Mr. Berkeley was a graduate of the Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia (1941), Yale University, BA, (Class of 1945), where he was a member of the Senior Society, Scroll and Key. He held an LL.B. degree from the University of Virginia (1949) and completed the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in 1966.

Deeply loved by her family and cherished by her many friends around the world, she is survived by her husband of seventeen years, Stephen M. DuBrul, Jr.; and by her nieces, Ellen Iseman and Beverly Ross, and four nephews, Peter Iseman, Fred Iseman, Alfred Ross, and Clifford Ross. She is also survived by two stepdaughters, Lise Motherwell and Jeannie Motherwell, from her first marriage, to the artist Robert Motherwell, and by two stepchildren, Jennifer DuBrul and Nicholas DuBrul, as well as three grandnephews, two grandnieces, four step-granddaughters, two step-great-grandsons, and one step-great-granddaughter. Helen Frankenthaler was born in Manhattan in 1928, the third daughter of New York State Supreme Court Judge Alfred Frankenthaler and Martha Lowenstein Frankenthaler. Her sisters, Marjorie Frankenthaler Iseman and Gloria Frankenthaler Ross Bookman, predeceased her. Helen Frankenthaler graduated from The Dalton School, having attended The Brearley School and The Horace Mann School. A 1949 graduate of Bennington College, she served as a member of the College's Board of Trustees from 1967 to 1982. She was the recipient of twenty-six honorary degrees, as well as other notable honors, including the National Medal of the Arts, in 2001. Most recently, she was appointed as an Honorary Academician of the Royal Academy of Arts, London in 2011. From 1985 to 1992, she was a member of the National Council on the Arts, part of the National Endowment for the Arts. A perfectionist and planner to the end, she made clear her wish to be buried at her alma mater, Bennington College, in Vermont, where a private ceremony will be held. A memorial service in New York City will be announced in the weeks ahead. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her memory to Bennington College or Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City. Helen was a family treasure, a national treasure, and will be forever missed by those who knew her well and by a public who admired her vibrant works of art. In her career she was an original, brilliant, energetic, witty presence who shone brightly in our firmament. With her passing, her world and her family are left with a deep void and diminished color."

2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,"WERNER--Anne Power, died of cancer on Christmas Day 2011, at her home in North Hampton, New Hampshire. Anne has no immediate survivors. She does leave, however, her good friend, Father Daniel Morrissey, and a host of others enriched by their relationship with this extraordinary woman. Anne was born in Paris in 1928, the only child of Annabella, an international film star. In 1939 Annabella married the American actor, Tyrone Power, who adopted Anne. She always spoke fondly of Power, and he of her. On April 5, 1941, Tyrone wrote in his journal, ""Today is Anni's birthday. I told Anni there was another present out front. She didn't say a word, just went over and touched the horse. After hugging the breath out of me, she kept whispering over and over again, My horse, my dear little horse."" Anne grew up in the Hollywood of the 1940s, a dazzling time. Yet in her telling of it Anne was not dazzled. The simple joys of daily family life remained most vivid to her. Her parents entertained some of the most beautiful and celebrated people in the world, and from her upstairs room she could watch the arriving guests, the Clark Gables, the Gary Coopers, the Henry Fondas, Judy Garland. To Anne they were not celebrities, and certainly not icons, but rather friends of the family from down the street. From childhood Anne spoke French and English. In her twenties she became fluent in German. Throughout her life she read broadly in those languages, deepening her love of history. Her experience as a world traveler made her an informed conversationalist. She was thoughtful, articulate, an eager listener, who genuinely wanted to know what others had to say. Anne exercised horses at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris. She also taught actors to ride, and while on the set of Decision Before Dawn, she met Oskar Werner, a prominent actor in European classical theater and film. After they married in 1954, they travelled throughout the world as Oskar became an international film star, but they lived in Liechtenstein. Anne was always very grateful that she was able to come to know the great literature of the German language and the music and opera of Werner's native Austria. Their marriage ended in 1968. Anne returned to the United States, settling in North Hampton, a small New Hampshire seaside town. She put down roots which deepened over time, taking a position as an aide teaching deaf children to speak, a job she held for nearly twenty years. After retiring she continued to work as a volunteer at the North Hampton Library. In 1998 Anne designed and built a home filled with light and welcoming to guests. She lived only a mile from the ocean, which she loved in all its moods, and could walk to it almost every day. Anne kept close ties to France and returned each summer to Annabella's sheep farm, Contramundo, in the foothills of the Pyrenees, outside St Jean de Luz. There in the Basque countryside Anne welcomed many American friends together with Romanov emigres, writers, politicians and artists who visited her mother. For each guest Anne made the beauty and vitality of Contramundo a unique and unforgettable memory. Tolstoy writes in War and Peace, which Anne reread many times, ""Love hinders death. Love is life. Everything, everything I understand, I understand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only because I love. Everything is connected only by that.""

By summertime, the city will unveil an ambitious bike-sharing system, with 10,000 bicycles available for short-term rentals at 600 locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn.

The Mini Matryoshka bag, a bucket tote in Goya leather, comes in seven Bauhaus-inspired color blocks, like canary yellow and grass green, or a Mondrian-esque red and black. There is much in the capsule that can be credited to her mother. ''She has a small-purse philosophy,'' Ms. Herrera Báez said, explaining why, for example, the bag is the compact size that it is. ''You carry only what is essential.'' But the graphic look and feel are original. ''Sometimes, great ideas on paper are just that,'' Ms. Herrera Báez said. ''The ability to fine-tune an aesthetic in tandem with intuition is a good trait for any designer to have.'' Tuck that one in your tote.

The correction also referred incorrectly to Malcolm Wilson, governor from 1973 to 1974. He was one of several Catholics who succeeded to the position without having been elected (including Martin H. Glynn, who served from 1913 to 1914 and was the state's first Catholic governor). Neither Mr. Wilson nor Mr. Carey was the second Catholic governor; Mr. Smith was."

2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,"AT the start of a promising new year -- and let's face it, they're all promising -- how much of the city really cares about you? You think steel cares? Steel is cold. Glass? Glass will cut you. Neon cares. Neon wants you to come inside where it's warm. It promises everything that lures people to New York: temptation and salvation, sustenance and health, romance and prophecy. No two neon signs are alike, and individual signs change over time, starting to flicker or losing a letter. Even at its most knowing, neon keeps its innocence."

''Without the bias of an education in dance, I came to Merce on my own. Sitting in the rafters at City Center every March, I'd watch the legions leave halfway through, unable to grasp the language of his gestures or the sounds that accompanied them. Years later when coincidence led me to share my life for some years with a dancer in the company, Merce admitted his pleasure at testing the limits of his audience, suggesting in not so many words that the ones who made it through somehow earned the pleasures he suffered, and earned, in his own art.''"

2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,"IT was pitch black at 8:30 a.m. on a frigid Icelandic morning, but at least there was no snow falling. Though cloud cover the night before had scuttled my chance to see the Northern Lights, my plan for a 36-hour road trip from Reykjavik, ending a great four days in Iceland, was in full effect. I had spent the previous day's precious daylight hours (about five at this time of year) seeing the geysers, waterfalls and icy landscapes of the Golden Circle, a popular route that loops northeast from the capital of Reykjavik and back again. When the sun disappeared, at about 3 p.m., I headed southeast to the snow-covered coast, skirting imposing mountains to arrive at a guesthouse called Vellir, on Route 219 off the main highway, where I planned to spend the night. I was to get moving before the sun rose, driving the 10 miles to Vik -- supposedly a picturesque village of 300 people, black sand beaches and amazing rock formations."

A wave of new electric cars and plug-in hybrids may be on the way, but the internal combustion engine showed no signs of stepping aside for an upstart successor. On the contrary, some new models were powered by gasoline-burning piston engines, often in downsized form and paired with ultra efficient transmissions, that delivered mileage nearly unthinkable a few years ago."

The Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year, is one of those exceptions. It opened in 1949 with an American menu, and six of its original dishes are still available. Two of them -- the tortilla soup and the McCarthy salad, above -- make up 15 percent of the sales for the restaurant."
2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,"All signs point to the public release of performance rankings for thousands of New York City teachers in 2012. The records rate 12,000 of the city's 75,000 teachers and are based on how much progress students made on the state's standardized tests, a controversial measurement tool. After several court rulings favoring the rankings' disclosure, the teachers' union is running out of legal options to keep them confidential. Losing on this issue would not be likely to undermine the union's political clout, though. Public education will undoubtedly play a central role in the 2013 mayoral race, and candidates will be expected to lay out their visions for the future once their campaigns pick up steam. One key question will be whether they will push to keep the schools under mayoral control."

It is also a record of his path out of that world, and his arrival among the New York Intellectuals, the storied group of Jewish writers and social theorists who graduated from City College and included Daniel Bell, Nathan Glazer and Irving Howe, among others."

2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,"COVERING more than two decades, ''Pretty Much Everything'' (Taschen, $700) is the first comprehensive monograph of the work of the Dutch wife-and-husband photo team Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin. The three-volume set, which includes a silkscreen print, jumbles together 666 photos. Some were originally ads; others first appeared in gallery shows. The resulting mix, in which glamorous celebrity portraits meet androgynous fine-art photos and manneristic fashion editorials, may seem a bit schizophrenic. But Ms. van Lamsweerde said that the book was constructed to show that these distinct genres matter less and less, at least for globally in-demand photographers like them. ''Sometimes our work that's been published as an advertising campaign ends up on the walls of a museum,'' she said.

There are already nine racetrack casinos and six American Indian casinos in New York. But the battle will be fierce over how many new casinos to allow, and where. The racetracks don't want competition. Other interests would cut the ties between casino gambling and horse racing. The Seneca and Oneida Nations oppose legalization. The Las Vegas and Atlantic City outfits favor casinos everywhere, especially in Manhattan; otherwise they will try to kill the amendment. What will Donald J. Trump or Stephen A. Wynn do?

2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,"1 ''Give me time, and I'll give you a revolution,'' Alexander McQueen once said. Like anyone born to achieve, he resented the small distractions -- and the fashion business provides plenty of them. Well, even he probably never dreamed that 661,509 people would go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to see his clothes. What were they expecting to see? Genius, yes; but the plain, early tailored pieces, like the bumster trousers and perfectly cut jackets, told a lot. The man knew what he was doing. Knowledge was his revolution. And whether or not he could see it, Mr. McQueen had built a durable brand. The Met show -- and the royal wedding dress designed by his successor, Sarah Burton -- was proof of that. 2 If you know anything about Ms. Burton (her skill, her objectivity, her patience), then it wasn't a surprise that Kate Middleton chose McQueen to make her gown as well as the streamlined dress worn by her sister, Pippa. Ms. Burton is a good listener, and she would have been sensitive to the bride and the overwhelming demands of the occasion. The dress distilled English tradition and needle crafts; its flawless fit and styling were communicated to a television audience of tens of millions, no small thing when the medium is cloth. So far, the Duchess of Cambridge has refused to allow herself to be pushed into the high-fashion trap. She wears clothes beautifully, from Reiss and Zara to McQueen, but the lady is no clothes horse. The last thing she wants to be, it seems, is another Jackie, Grace or Diana."

Norborne was born June 5, 1922 in Bethlehem, PA, the only son of Norborne Berkeley and Dorothea Randolph Berkeley. His one sister, Dorothea Berkeley Brush, died in 1991. Mr. Berkeley was President of Chemical Bank and Chemical NY Corporation (now JPMorgan Chase) from 1973-1982. He was a Director of both the Corporation and the Bank since 1972, and had been with Chemical since 1950, serving in a variety of positions before becoming President. From January, 1982 until June, 1982 he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee, at which time he retired at the age of 60. Mr. Berkeley was a graduate of the Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia (1941), Yale University, BA, (Class of 1945), where he was a member of the Senior Society, Scroll and Key. He held an LL.B. degree from the University of Virginia (1949) and completed the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in 1966.

Mr. Berkeley was an avid and accomplished sportsman throughout his life, including baseball at Yale, squash, skiing and golf. He enjoyed playing his father's ukelele and singing old, family songs; the cultural opportunities in New York City, especially the theatre; and travel around the world. His friendships formed at Yale were very special to him throughout his life and his sense of humor, value system and compassion for his fellow man will always be remembered by his many, many friends and family.

Fortunately, I'm not reflecting on the whole messy enterprise of life itself. I'm concerned with drinking. Can I, should I, really keep going after a season of festive drinking that ended a little too festively? Before I go on, a disclaimer: You should not have cause to make a habit of the hair of the dog. And if you're under the impression it will truly help KO your hangover, you're standing on shaky scientific ground. Moving on, then: When it comes to picking a next-day drink, I enjoy making bloody marys a good deal more than I like drinking them. A pint of Guinness frequently feels like just the thing, but it's not as nourishing as it looks. What I really want is protein and a bit of effervescence."

2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,"This most uncertain political year starts with something we know: Nearly one in five members of the Texas House will not be coming back. Whether they are running for higher office (about half) or because they have had quite enough for now (the rest), almost 30 members of the 150-member House will not seek re-election. Couple that with the high number of freshmen elected in 2010, and you can bet that the next legislative session will have an abundance of inexperience. What amounts to huge turnover in the State Senate is small by any other standard, with four of the 31 members saying they will not be back. The rest -- and perhaps the new replacements -- might see the most political fallout after the November elections. If Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst is elected to the United States Senate, the senators will elect his replacement from their own ranks in a process that is like a professional version of a race for student body president. Every candidate knows every voter, and everyone will know how everyone else voted."
2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,"Budget constraints brought on by the bad economy have already made it more difficult for Albany to bail out failing hospitals in the city. North General in Harlem, propped up for years by the local political establishment, closed in 2010. So did St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, and two hospitals in Queens closed in 2009. Brooklyn is next. In the coming year, the state will have to decide how to deal with a few struggling hospitals serving poor communities there. Mergers and reorganizations are on the table, and thousands of jobs and the welfare of tens of thousands of patients are at stake."

Some posit that if President Obama is re-elected, he may finally act on his 2008 campaign promise to fix the country's immigration system. He has called for this for years, but has simultaneously deported more illegal immigrants than any other president. Between Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.'s recent visit to Texas and the United States Justice Department's crackdown on enforcement of Arizona's controversial immigration law -- which Texas lawmakers continue to toy with -- his administration appears to be working to counteract this reputation."

The goal is to speed the deportations of convicted criminals while sparing many illegal immigrants who have no criminal records and have deep roots in the community. In the absence of comprehensive revisions to federal immigration law, meanwhile, state governments will continue to move unilaterally on immigration issues. New York remains one of the nation's friendlier states to immigrants, and some legislators are seeking to expand educational opportunities for illegal immigrants by making them eligible for state financial aid and scholarships. The idea has received the backing of the Board of Regents, and a related bill may come up for a vote in 2012."

This is my last post for 2011, an eventful year in fashion, a most peculiar year that saw a feverish spread of luxury brands in places like China and Brazil, chasing new wealth, even as insiders saw the Galliano scandal as a sobering episode for an industry that tends to push its talent hard. I wonder, though, if the insider's influence hasn't waned. To be sure, people admire the genuinely talented, and we're attracted to star personalities both on the runway and in the front row. It's also true that fashion, like everything else, runs in cycles - one moment it's guilty of gluttony, the next it regrets the whole thing. But outsiders seldom feel these mood swings; they just know what they want, and the business side of fashion houses (along with the more astute creative directors, like Christopher Bailey of Burberry) has seen to it that they get what they want."

2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,"After an astonishingly quick and robust recovery from the recession, the city's financial industry was hit hard in 2011. The big American and foreign banks that dominate the action on Wall Street resharpened their axes and cut even more staff members last year than in 2009: more than 200,000 jobs were lost, many of them in the city. Whatever New Yorkers think of bankers, the city's economy relies on their outsize compensation. The city's Independent Budget Office forecasts that the financial companies will continue to shed jobs through the first half of 2012. And then the hiring will be grudging: Marisa Di Natale, an economist at Moody's Analytics, predicts that Wall Street will not regain all its lost jobs for more than a decade."

Rick Perry has credited with creating nearly half of the jobs in the national work force since mid-2009, may have dominated headlines in 2011, but heading into 2012 the state's job growth should look far more routine. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, said Texas job growth was likely to remain at about 1.5 percent to 2 percent. While the state gained 289,900 private-sector jobs in the last year, Texas' news is not all good. The state's unemployment rate hovered above 8 percent in 2011, while the rest of the nation improved, and the national unemployment rate dropped to 8.6 percent by November. According to the latest statistics from the Texas Workforce Commission, the state lost 63,900 public-sector jobs, largely as a result of lawmakers' budget cuts, and mostly in public education. Texas is only a few months into those cuts."

2012-01-02T00:00:00Z,"3. NEW ORLEANS SAINTS (13-3, South) 6. DETROIT LIONS (10-6, wild card) The Saints are the team nobody wants to play, particularly at the Superdome, where they have rewritten large sections of the offensive record book this season. The Lions have the battle scars to prove it. On Dec. 4, Detroit ventured into New Orleans and fell behind, 17-0, and trailed at halftime, 24-7, on the way to a 31-17 New Orleans victory. It's no secret why. The Saints, with the top passing offense, have more weapons than any other team in the N.F.L. The 6-foot-6 tight end Jimmy Graham is practically uncoverable, and when teams try to double-team him, they leave somebody like Marques Colston alone. When the Carolina Panthers tried to blanket Graham on Sunday, Colston had 145 yards receiving and 2 touchdowns. Drew Brees merely set the single-season mark for passing yards and broke his own record for completion percentage."

Family, friends, colleagues, bridge partners, mystery lovers, Democrats, agitators, and loyal Californians all mourn the sudden passing of Helen Palmer, December 30, 2011 at Cedars-Sinai Hospital. Our ""Iron Lady"", Helen lived to a spirited 94 and thrived in robust health, sharp wit, and open heart throughout. She was born in Lennox, South Dakota, raised throughout the Midwest, started her family with the late B. Mitchell Palmer in San Francisco and moved to Los Angeles where she remained for the rest of her years. Irrepressibly enterprising, she enjoyed an expansive career spanning advertising sales at the Los Angeles Times and a series of creative businesses launched with her sister-in-law, best friend and confidant, Rita Corwin. In later years, she turned this energy to serving as a scion of the Beverly Hills Bridge Club, where she rose to the rank of Silver Master and competed without mercy, even to her last hand. Above all, Helen's greatest passion was her family. Her marriage to Mitch was a true partnership, ahead of its time, and the two stood side-by-side at the head of a still-expanding family. They are survived by their son Mark J. Palmer of Beverly Hills, their daughter Stephanie Palmer McClelland and her husband Carter McClelland of Manhattan; Mark's daughter Jenni Palmer and her husband Sam Gall of greater Los Angeles; Stephanie and Carter's children Cary McClelland, Spencer McClelland and his wife Eliza, all of New York; Rita Corwin and Rita's children Leni Corwin, Miles Corwin, his wife Diane, and their son Marius of Pasadena and Altadena. Helen's delight in our accomplishments was the fire that drove us forward, and her counsel the light that shone the way. She remains in our memory - scotch in one hand, sudoku in the other, and smiling always. A memorial will be scheduled, and, in lieu of flowers, the family requests that gifts in Helen's name be sent to the West Hollywood Library and Susan G. Komen for the Cure."

2012-01-03T12:01:08Z,"The conventional wisdom holds that Rick Santorum's last-minute bid to consolidate the not-Mitt Romney vote in Iowa is, like so many other developments in this election season, nothing but good news for Romney - because Santorum's rise is preventing Rick Perry or Newt Gingrich from gaining ground instead, and in a drawn-out campaign Romney would ultimately ""be more threatened by Gingrich or Perry"" (as HotAir's Ed Morrissey puts it) than by the former Pennsylvania senator. ""On record, on economic conservative credibility, on ties to big donors,"" Dave Weigel writes, ""Santorum's not the opponent Romney feared most."" ""If Perry or Gingrich are in the top three, we have a real race headed into South Carolina,"" Erick Erickson suggests. But if Santorum wins Iowa, ""we might as well sit back and declare Mitt Romney the nominee."" (Judging by these quotes, the Romney camp seems to agree.)"

2012-01-03T00:00:00Z,"IF you want to know what is wrong with American health care today, exhibit A might be the two new proton beam treatment facilities the Mayo Clinic has begun building, one in Minnesota, the other in Arizona, at a cost of more than $180 million dollars each. They are part of a medical arms race for proton beam machines, which could cost taxpayers billions of dollars for a treatment that, in many cases, appears to be no better than cheaper alternatives. Proton beam therapy is a kind of radiation used to treat cancers. The particles are made of atomic nuclei rather than the usual X-rays, and theoretically can be focused more precisely on cancerous tissue, minimizing the danger to healthy tissue surrounding it. But the machines are tremendously expensive, requiring a particle accelerator encased in a football-field-size building with concrete walls. As a result, Medicare will pay around $50,000 for proton beam therapy for a patient with prostate cancer, roughly twice as much as it would if the patient received another type of radiation."

2012-01-03T00:00:00Z,"IF you want to know what is wrong with American health care today, exhibit A might be the two new proton beam treatment facilities the Mayo Clinic has begun building, one in Minnesota, the other in Arizona, at a cost of more than $180 million dollars each. They are part of a medical arms race for proton beam machines, which could cost taxpayers billions of dollars for a treatment that, in many cases, appears to be no better than cheaper alternatives. Proton beam therapy is a kind of radiation used to treat cancers. The particles are made of atomic nuclei rather than the usual X-rays, and theoretically can be focused more precisely on cancerous tissue, minimizing the danger to healthy tissue surrounding it. But the machines are tremendously expensive, requiring a particle accelerator encased in a football-field-size building with concrete walls. As a result, Medicare will pay around $50,000 for proton beam therapy for a patient with prostate cancer, roughly twice as much as it would if the patient received another type of radiation."

2012-01-04T00:00:00Z,"One of the major casting questions pending on Broadway is whether ''Newsies,'' this spring's new Disney musical, will star Jeremy Jordan, whose performance as the newsboy Jack Kelly drew critical acclaim in the show's premiere in New Jersey last year and helped persuade Disney Theatrical Productions to transfer it to New York. Now that Mr. Jordan is free from the Broadway musical ''Bonnie & Clyde,'' which closed on Friday, it's a good bet that he'll be hawking ''papes'' as Jack on Broadway. The director of ''Newsies,'' Jeff Calhoun, who also directed Mr. Jordan in ''Bonnie & Clyde,'' recently told BroadwayWorld.com that ''it'll be fun to be with Jeremy again'' - which was apparently an inadvertent slip on his part, since a moment later Mr. Calhoun lamented that he might get ''in trouble'' for saying that. Speaking of the actor and Disney, Mr. Calhoun added, ''I'm sure they'll work out things, and he'll be back as Jack Kelly.'' Mr. Jordan, when told of Mr. Calhoun's remarks, laughed and then came close to confirming the scoop to that theater Web site: ''I think it's safe to say that I will probably be on board with that. It's not 100 percent by any means yet, but I imagine pretty soon things will all get worked out.''"

Watching the final games of the regular season to see who wins the last few playoff berths is one of the most exciting times for a football fan.

After graduating from the High School of Commerce, he fought with distinction as an infantryman in WWII, volunteering for reconnaissance duty ahead of the front lines in France and Germany. After the war, he worked as a diamond cutter in Manhattan, and rose to the highest echelons of the diamond industry, principally during his long tenure at Zale Corporation, where he served as a Director and as President of the International Diamond Division. Mr. Ginsberg's influential role in the world's diamond markets on behalf of Zale took him around the globe twice a year and on numerous overseas trips in between--this son of the Great Depression a regular, esteemed visitor to the Far East, Russia, India, Africa, Israel and Europe. Mr. Ginsberg was a serious reader, an avid golfer, a staunch supporter of Israel and the ADL, a sparkling conversationalist who loved to laugh, and, perhaps most strikingly of all, a world-class listener.

2012-01-06T00:00:00Z,"The case of the vacant ''Star Trek'' role appears to be solved - or has it? The ''Sherlock'' star Benedict Cumberbatch, who offers a contemporary portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's consulting detective, Sherlock Holmes, on that BBC and PBS series, has been cast in a major role in a sequel to ''Star Trek,'' the cinematic reimagining of James T. Kirk's outer-space adventures from J. J. Abrams and his crew. But just what role Mr. Cumberbatch will play in the new movie is a mystery all its own. The Web site Deadline.com wrote that there was ''no word yet on whether he'll be a hero or villain'' in the ''Star Trek'' sequel, while the Showblitz blog of Variety wrote that Mr. Cumberbatch would ''play the villain,'' in a role that the ''Carlos'' star Edgar Ramirez previously auditioned for. The film journalist Devin Faraci wondered if Mr. Cumberbatch would be playing Sybok, who is Spock's half-brother (and apparently named for a random assemblage of Scrabble tiles), though he acknowledged this was highly illogical speculation."

''For the July 18 concert,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, Paul McCartney ''miraculously appeared, having been whisked through customs at Kennedy International Airport after a flight from London that had been allowed to land early. He was sped to the stadium by a motorcade in 11 minutes and driven onto the field in time to perform by Pete Flynn, the dedicated groundskeeper who had driven the Beatles to the same stage 43 years earlier.'' Mr. Holden added: '' 'If it weren't for the Beatles,' Mr. Joel declares, 'I wouldn't do what I do.' Call it perfect symmetry. The final number, 'Let It Be,' rings as a sweet valedictory to all the struggle, the teamwork and the glory captured in this wonderful film.'' In the film ''The Love We Make'' (2011), at 11 on Showtime, Albert Maysles, Bradley Kaplan and Ian Markiewicz capture Mr. McCartney's experiences in New York City after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and his performance the next month with Elton John, Mr. Joel and David Bowie in the ''Concert for New York City'' at Madison Square Garden. Mr. McCartney had been on the runway at Kennedy when the attacks occurred."

No other performances have been scheduled in the United States. The show had its premiere at the Manchester International Festival in England and has received ecstatic reviews from critics. Performed in the round, it features a 24-woman choir, giant Tesla coils and several large custom-built instruments that Bjork and her collaborators invented: a portable pipe organ, four 10-foot pendulums that play harp notes as they swing, a gramophone-like contraption called a ''Sharpsichord'' and another piece called a ''gameleste,'' which is a fusion of a celesta and a gamelan. The songs are eerie and convoluted, with usual melodies and fluctuating meters, meant to capture the patterns in natural phenomena like those of gravity, lunar cycles, DNA and crystals.

That was a 6.3 percent increase from 2010, when the lagging economy and a number of weak summer lineups caused sales to drop by as much as 15 percent, the concert industry's first decline in 15 years."

Tolkien's latest detractor, according to a report in a Swedish newspaper, is the jury for the 1961 Nobel Prize in literature, which dismissed him as a candidate for the honor, saying Tolkien wasn't up to snuff. BBC News, citing recently disclosed papers that were printed in the Sydsvenska Dagbladet newspaper, said that C. S. Lewis, the essayist and author of his own ''Chronicles of Narnia'' fantasy books, tried to nominate Tolkien, his friend and fellow Oxford faculty member, for the Nobel.

2012-01-08T00:00:00Z,"PALMER--Helen G. Family, friends, colleagues, bridge partners, mystery lovers, Democrats, agitators, and loyal Californians all mourn the sudden passing of Helen Palmer, December 30, 2011 at Cedars-Sinai Hospital. Our ""Iron Lady"", Helen lived to a spirited 94 and thrived in robust health, sharp wit, and open heart throughout. She was born in Lennox, South Dakota, raised throughout the Midwest, started her family with the late B. Mitchell Palmer in San Francisco and moved to Los Angeles where she remained for the rest of her years. Irrepressibly enterprising, she enjoyed an expansive career spanning advertising sales at the Los Angeles Times and a series of creative businesses launched with her sister-in-law, best friend and confidant, Rita Corwin. In later years, she turned this energy to serving as a scion of the Beverly Hills Bridge Club, where she rose to the rank of Silver Master and competed without mercy, even to her last hand. Above all, Helen's greatest passion was her family. Her marriage to Mitch was a true partnership, ahead of its time, and the two stood side-by-side at the head of a still-expanding family. They are survived by their son Mark J. Palmer of Beverly Hills, their daughter Stephanie Palmer McClelland and her husband Carter McClelland of Manhattan; Mark's daughter Jenni Palmer and her husband Sam Gall of greater Los Angeles; Stephanie and Carter's children Cary McClelland, Spencer McClelland and his wife Eliza, all of New York; Rita Corwin and Rita's children Leni Corwin, Miles Corwin, his wife Diane, and their son Marius of Pasadena and Altadena. Helen's delight in our accomplishments was the fire that drove us forward, and her counsel the light that shone the way. She remains in our memory - scotch in one hand, sudoku in the other, and smiling always. A memorial will be scheduled, and, in lieu of flowers, the family requests that gifts in Helen's name be sent to the West Hollywood Library and Susan G. Komen for the Cure."

It is Mr. Hunt's own uncanny eye that allows him to pull off this quirky conceit so well. His selections run from virtually unknown 19th-century works by Fratelli Alinari, featuring a man covered by a blanket walking on a high wire, to Richard Avedon's picture of Sophia Loren throwing her head back, taken around 1970. At right, Seymour Sheer's ''There's a Girl Under There,'' from 1967, is at once whimsical and nerve-racking. Works by Diane Arbus, Weegee, Edward Steichen and William Eggleston are included.

As recently as 1997, it was still possible for Jeff George to lead the league with less than 4,000 yards passing: 3,917, to be exact. For most of football's history, a 3,000-yard season was an accomplishment, 4,000 yards were a feat and 5,000 yards marked the distance from home to the nearest hardware store, not an attainable passing goal."
2012-01-08T00:00:00Z,"SCHIFFRIN--Milton J. (""RED""), PH.D. Milton Schiffrin (""Red"" to most of his friends) passed away quietly December 2, 2011 at age 97. Born on the East Coast to Russian immigrant parents, and to very modest circumstances, Red was the oldest of three brothers. During the Great Depression, Red temporarily dropped out of college to help support his parents and siblings, working in a sweat shop for $8 a week. Although he originally had majored in music, when he returned to college he completed his BS in chemistry and math. However, music always remained a special passion of his. He particularly enjoyed opera and classical music, and with his basso profundo voice, he loved to sing. Red completed his formal education in Montreal, Canada, at McGill University, where he received his Ph.D. in physiology, studying under Pavlov's number one disciple, Leo Babkin. In 1942 he joined what was then the Army Air Force and the same year, he met and married his British bride, ""Phemie."" They enjoyed a marriage lasting almost 50 years, ending only with her passing. In 1946 Red became a clinical research associate at Hoffman-La Roche, a large pharmaceutical company based in Basel, Switzerland. He stayed with ""Roche"" throughout his working career, ultimately assuming the position of Vice President and head of ""Drug Regulatory Affairs."" Red became a recognized expert in the ins and outs of obtaining FDA approval of new drugs. Red also taught at three medical schools, wrote or contributed to several medical textbooks, and contributed more than 40 articles to medical journals. He was inducted into several prestigious professional and scientific societies, and in 1973, was greatly honored to be made President of the American Medical Writers' Association. Despite many lifetime accomplishments and honors, Red's greatest pleasure was in helping and bringing joy to others. He loved poetry and prose, politics and humor, and he read extensively. He retained his extremely sharp mind and rich memory to the end, easily reciting long passages from favorites such as Shakespeare. Recently, his brother Harold and he challenged each other to remember stanzas of the poem, ""Invictus."" They exchanged recitations, line by line, and Harold noted that the poem's famous closing line, ""I am the Master of my fate, I am the Captain of my soul"" could have been written to summarize Red's character and strength. Red is survived by his brother, Harold, his two children, Hilary Greenstreet and David Schiffrin, two granddaughters, Kari and Brooke Schiffrin, and the second love of his life, ""June"" Davis."

It was considered backward music for tourists; it was Dixie Beatlemania. And yet. Fifty years later, there is no other place like Preservation Hall.

The line, Mr. Wu's first in collaboration with a mass retailer, possesses a lot of his label's familiar feminine spirit but takes more direct inspiration from French New Wave films and the actress Jean Seberg.

Carey was born in New York City on October 28, 1970, and died there on December 28, 2011. He grew up largely in Providence, Rhode Island, graduating from the Wheeler School in 1988, and then cum laude from Harvard, where he studied English and American Literature as a member of the class of 1992. He formed many close friendships in his school years-and everywhere he went-which endured throughout his life. Carey was a writer, editor, poet, and musician. He lived with an openness to the world and to the experiences of others: born Catholic, he considered himself culturally Jewish and spiritually Zen Buddhist. In Red Hook, Brooklyn, he was well known as a community activist, engaged with his neighbors on issues ranging from helicopter-noise pollution to economic justice; he was also the founding manager of the Red Hook Wobblies softball team. He would cook for friends and loved ones or gather them for expeditions to Chinatown restaurants, and talk with them for hours around the table. His conversation, like his correspondence and his kindness, could lighten their darkest moments. Carey took his own life. His mother, Rose Monserrate, mourns the loss of her beloved son.

(13, 49) DOWNTON ABBEY ''Masterpiece Classic'' inaugurates a new chapter in this soap opera, created by Julian Fellowes, about masters and servants at the twilight of the British Empire. Hugh Bonneville returns as Lord Grantham, who, with three daughters and no direct male heir, is being forced to hand down his beloved ancestral home to a middle-class third cousin, Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens), along with the fortune of his American-born heiress wife (Elizabeth McGovern, above). Maggie Smith is his imperious mother, and Siobhan Finneran is Miss O'Brien, Lady Grantham's Machiavellian maid. The story reopens in 1916 at the Battle of the Somme, where Matthew -- his romance with Lord Grantham's eldest daughter, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), derailed -- is now an officer trying to keep his troops alive. ''As the dowager countess, Ms. Smith has many of the best lines and usually the last word,'' Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. ''When her middle granddaughter, Lady Edith, frets that she will end up a spinster, Lady Violet says briskly, 'Don't be defeatist, Dear, it's very middle class.' There is nothing middle class about 'Downton Abbey.' Even a world war can't sever the bond between aristocrats and the servants who love them.'' 9 A.M.

2012-01-08T00:00:00Z,"LEVINE--Sanford C.,89, of Dobbs Ferry died on January 6th after a heroic struggle with multiple illnesses. His wife of 65 years, Laurel (Gottlober) mourns and misses him. For the last six years of his life, she cared for all of his needs during his serious illness. He is mourned also by his daughters Linda and Amy, a grandaughter, Leah, and another daughter Elizabeth. Born in New York City, Mr. Levine grew up in the Inwood section of New York. He graduated from Clinton High School and the New York University School of Law. Mr. Levine was the original renaissance man. No piece of masking tape or stray wire in his home went unused. He cherished every drill, wrench and soldering gun; if a tool or cable did not exist to meet his needs, he fashioned it himself, employing tubing, duct tape, electrical connectors, solder, and whatever else was at hand. His motto seemed to be don't buy it before you try to make it. In the attic of his large home, Mr. Levine built a darkroom and for many years he had a tidy retreat from the four females in his life there he could develop his photos and employ his creativity to create beautiful pictures of his of his wife and daughters to whom he was devoted; A lover of music and literature, Mr. Levine worked for a time at the record label, Allegra, owned by his uncle, Sam Puner, where he pressed records, and wrote liner notes. He also worked as a chemist, audio-visual technician, prosthesis designer and writer among other endeavors, until he finally attended New York University Law School. He passed the New York Bar in 1957. Mr. Levine lost a leg when he was a young man. His parents were concerned he would never marry, but he met Laurel Gottlober in 1946 when he was playing chess outside the tennis court where Miss Gottlober was playing. He proposed a month later. Miss Gottlober's mother had had other plans for her daughter, and had the new fiance followed, particularly to his favorite jazz clubs on 52nd Street. However, the mother-in-law to be grew to revere her son in-law, whose talent and skill with bricks and mortar, and later, the law, were shared with gentility. Though considered disabled, Mr. Levine never filed for disability to sustain him, but worked throughout his life, as a family practice lawyer, and later as an Administrative Law Judge for the state of New York. He retired in 1993. Mr. Levine loved books and words; in his older years, as his tight circle of friends passed away, he found some solace writing poetry and studying mathematics. He loved to travel and even journeyed twice on trips where dialysis was provided. Ultimately those trips had to stop. Before they did, The Levine couple explored most of Europe, Israel, Egypt, and parts of South and Central America. A faithful New Yorker, a younger Mr. Levine loved prowling Canal Street for tools and stereo equipment., and shmoozing in delis with his friends. One of his final requests, from his hospital bed, was via a note handed to his wife. It read ""egg cream."" Services will be private. A memorial is planned for the spring."

They represent diametrically different points of view on the subject, and they were not speaking in response to each other, but it was as good as a point/counterpoint presentation of dueling editorials. ''I would abolish fighting, like today,'' Devellano, the Red Wings' senior vice president, said on a podcast for the New York cable network SNY. ''I would eliminate it immediately.

A survey conducted in August by New American Dimensions, a marketing research company, of 1,000 car owners with vehicles registered in California found that about half changed their oil every 3,000 miles or less, although very few automakers call for such frequent intervals. It also found that less than 10 percent consulted their car manuals for recommended oil-change schedules."

2012-01-08T00:00:00Z,"HOW do you make the experience of live theater pop on film in a way that makes a potential ticket buyer say, ''I've got to see that''? Television commercials are a mainstay, but expensive. Trailers -- which can run longer than 15 or 30 seconds and be widely distributed -- are increasingly being used to promote theater, but producing them is still a challenge in terms of style, access and cost. ''Everybody is trying it, and I don't think anyone has nailed it,'' said Thomas Weitz, the director for digital assets at Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago. The result, he said, is a grab bag of approaches that hasn't yet been codified into the voice-of-God style that makes movie trailers so easy to parody."

Responses reflected an unusually wide array of ideas, from the conviction that nothing in the world could justify experiments like those in question to the equally impassioned conviction that nothing should get in their way. Similarly, some argued that the data these experiments produced are of only marginal usefulness, while others felt they would prove as invaluable as Galileo's discovery.

(The issue of whether Mr. Muskie actually won Iowa is a longstanding one. On Jan. 26, 1972, The Times declared Mr. Muskie the ''victor'' in a story on Page 16.

He also played football (QB) at Georgia Tech for a year during ROTC in 45 (not the Bulldogs best year). He was a long-time resident of Westfield, NJ and New York City. He is predeceased by his wife Margaretha of 42 years and his brother, Marvin and two sisters, Miriam and Leonore. He is survived by his two children, Steven Kantor (who resides with his wife Jane in New York City) and Clarissa Taylor (who resides with her husband BJ in Westfield). He also is survived by his four grandchildren who he adored Chloe, Caroline, Ben and Jack as well as his devoted friend of recent years Andrea Berger. In 1960, Norm took over United Supply Co. from his father and grew it into the largest family-owned HVAC and plumbing supply house in NJ. Known nationally throughout the industry as a great innovator, Norm introduced the first retail plumbing showrooms, Kitchen & BathWorks, in 1982. The company is celebrating 100 years of success and continues to be owned and run by the family an accomplishment in which he took great pride. But his priorities were never financial success, they were much richer goals and, by example, he taught us all. He saw everyone as a friend and treated everyone with dignity, respect and empathy. Each person he met was important to him and if they had time to listen, he had a story for them sometimes even if they didn't have time to listen. Optimism was his religion. He taught us life was a wonderful gift and each day was another chance to do good and enjoy it. He put family and friends first and as everyone he met quickly became his friend, his life was busy and full until his last months. Norm also was gifted with many passions and talents. A jack-of-all-trades, he was an accomplished fine artist and sculptor, a film producer (Pretty Boy Floyd, Black Like Me), and a great writer who never published. He had a great love for and knowledge of tennis and Shakespeare. He was a memorable dancer (crazy legs) but not a great singer although that never stopped him. He was truly one of those rare people who lived his life the way we all hope to, but rarely do with unstoppable optimism, an undeniably warm smile and happy laughter through thick and thin. This was his gift to us all. We love you Dad"

An appeals court denied him much of that claim under tax and pension laws and reduced it further, saying he had to repay United Way for the harm he inflicted through his fraud and to cover punitive damages, taxes and lawyers' fees; the court did not say he ''had to repay the money he stole.''

Schizer and the Columbia Law School community mourn deeply the loss of Hans Smit, a distinguished professor and a leading scholar and practitioner in the field of international arbitration and international procedure. For more than 50 years, Hans was a powerful presence at Columbia Law School, where he made a remarkable contribution to the institution, to generations of students, and to the field of international arbitration. After earning his LL.B. and LL.M. from the University of Amsterdam in 1946 and 1949, respectively, Hans worked in private practice in The Hague and New York City. He earned a master's degree at Columbia in 1953 and graduated first in his class with an LL.B. from the Law School in 1958. Hans joined the Columbia Law School faculty in 1960, where he directed the Project on International Procedure, which attracted top legal minds such as Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who served as a research associate and associate director. He also directed other pioneering international law programs at Columbia, including the Parker School of Foreign and Comparative Law and the Center for East European Law. In 1965, Hans helped establish the Law School as a global hub for the study of international law by serving as director of the Project on European Legal Institutions. The project yielded a seminal work, The Law of the European Economic Community. Hans was a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and the International Academy of Comparative Law, and he was knighted by the Queen of the Netherlands. Our hearts go out to his wife, Beverly; their son, Robert H. Smit, and their daughter, Marion Smit, for this great loss."

For the last several years, Roku has been one of the companies selling devices that let users stream Internet video to their televisions from a big lineup of programming sources, including Netflix and Hulu Plus.

Based on album sales, Adele was the top artist, followed by Justin Bieber, above, and Michael Bublé. Digital album sales rose 19.5 percent from 2010, to 103.1 million. Again, Adele was tops, but a different audience buys digital music rather than CD albums, so ''Under the Mistletoe'' and ''Own the Night'' were not among the top 10, but ''Mylo Xyloto'' by Coldplay and ''Torches'' by Foster the People were.

''The Devil Inside,'' acquired by Paramount Pictures for $1 million, was a strong No. 1, taking in an estimated $34.5 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. That surprisingly robust result, attributed largely to an aggressive online marketing campaign, reinforces Paramount's status as the current kingpin of the horror genre, which has sagged of late with the exception of the studio's ''Paranormal Activity'' franchise. But don't expect ''The Devil Inside'' to have a long life in theaters: Buzz quickly turned negative over the weekend, with the exit polling company CinemaScore giving the film an F grade."

(Sho2) THE KING'S SPEECH (2010) Colin Firth, left, in an Oscar-winning role, portrays Albert Frederick Arthur George, or Bertie, as his family called him, the shy second son of George V of Britain (Michael Gambon) in this film from Tom Hooper. Geoffrey Rush is Lionel Logue, the speech therapist who helps him conquer his debilitating stutter. And Helena Bonham Carter is Elizabeth, Bertie's wife and staunch support system, who can't quite stomach Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), the American divorcée who derails Bertie's older brother, David (Guy Pearce), from his position as Edward VIII. ''It isn't exactly 'Pygmalion,' not least because Mr. Hooper has no intention of satirizing the caste system that is one of this movie's biggest draws,'' Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, said of the film, which earned Mr. Hooper an Oscar as best director. ''Each character has his moments, instances when Bertie the closed book tentatively opens and Logue's arrogance gets away from him, but both are too decent, too banal and the film too ingratiating to resonate deeply.'' In the end, she added, ''like many entertainments of this pop-historical type, 'The King's Speech' wears history lightly no matter how heavy the crown.'' The film also received Academy Awards for best picture and original screenplay (David Seidler). 8 P.M.

Horse-drawn fire trucks clattered to the scene from around Manhattan and thundered to the island over the Brooklyn Bridge, but to no avail, as temperatures dipped to 16 degrees and winds gusted up to 68 miles an hour.

But the 2012 Republican presidential contest will not proceed in a straight line, evenly spaced out over the next six months. Rather, it is broken up into different phases, each of which will have its own, interesting political dynamic that will affect how the candidates campaign, how they hoard their cash and how they travel. Mitt Romney's lead in New Hampshire - he is ahead of his nearest competitor,Ron Paul, by 20 points in most polls - may prove decisive. Consecutive Romney victories in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina would be unprecedented for a Republican candidate, and could prompt the others to drop out quickly.

Although this might seem self-evident, it can also be quantified. The Times's FiveThirtyEight blog has developed a measure of poll volatility that calculates how much a candidate's polling shifted month to month, above and beyond random variance. Since 1984, when primary polling became widespread, the candidates with the three highest volatility scores have been Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, and Herman Cain, all of whom ran this year."

2012-01-10T00:00:00Z,"Already, the benches in gym locker rooms and beside basketball courts are filling with 2012's early casualties, those of us who, goaded by New Year's resolutions, are exercising a bit too enthusiastically and developing sore muscles. Many of us will then drape ice packs over our aching muscles. But a new review article published this month in the journal Sports Medicine suggests that for sore muscles, ice is not always the panacea that most of us believe it to be and that, in some instances, it can be counterproductive. For the study, researchers at the University of Ulster and University of Limerick in Ireland reviewed almost three dozen earlier studies of the effects of using ice to combat sore muscles, a practice that many who exercise often employ. Ice is, after all, the ''I'' in the acronym RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation), which remains the standard first-aid protocol for dealing with a sports-related injury. Icing is also widely used to deal with muscles that twinge but aren't formally injured. Watch almost any football, basketball or soccer game, at any level, and you'll likely see many of the players icing body parts during halftime, preparing to return to play."

The study concluded that such a project would significantly increase Helsinki's efforts to become a cultural capital. Among the recommendations: to build the museum on a city-owned site on Helsinki's South Harbor waterfront; to have an international architecture competition to decide who should design the building; to create a midsize museum of about 129,000 square feet, with 42,000 square feet of exhibition space; and to set it up largely as a noncollecting institution. The estimated cost would be around $178 million. Richard Armstrong, director of the Guggenheim Foundation, said of the study's results: ''It's one of those courtship moments when you look at one another and say let's see how we can complement each other. It's a big next step.'' The study is now in the hands of the City Board and the City Council of Helsinki, which will review the material over the next few weeks and decide whether to proceed. If they do then they will begin an architectural competition. In a telephone interview, Mayor Jussi Pajunen called the study ''very valuable.''"

But I loved the sport. I carried my football everywhere, just in case anyone wanted to play catch. I slept with it to prevent fumbling. And even more important, I loved the New York Giants.

Judge Becky Dean-Walker of Hudspeth County told The A.P. that these cases are usually resolved by a no-contest plea and a mailed-in fine of up to $500."

(13, 49) KANGAROO MOB In the last 50 years, the population of eastern gray kangaroos around Canberra, the capital of Australia, has multiplied from a few hundred to tens of thousands. Forced to search for food beyond the city's drought-stricken hills, the hungry creatures have moved into urban territory, dining on parkland and lawns -- and dying by the thousands in run-ins with cars. That has led the government to reduce herds through extermination, prompting an emotional backlash. This ''Nature'' episode follows a gang of street-wise kangaroos to reveal how they survive in the city. Among them are Black Spot, above, at more than 6 feet tall the mob's dominant male and the father of most of the joeys in his group, and Madge, who teaches her son Sonny about survival among humans while carrying a nursing joey named Alice in her pouch.

2012-01-11T00:00:00Z,"KOENIG--Dr. Leonard Eli, much loved husband, father, grandfather, and great grandfather, in Los Angeles of natural causes on Sunday, January 8, 2012. He was 97. Len was born May 25, 1914 on Selwin Avenue in the Bronx, NY to Oscar and Becky Koenig from Strch, Austria. He had one sister, Helen. Len graduated from Indiana University in 1937 with a BA in science and math, then attended Colombia University Dental School where he graduated in 1942 with honors. He went on to complete a residency at New York Hospital for Joint Diseases, and opened his own practice in 1946. On April 11, 1948 Len married the love of his life, Pauline Ladin, a French teacher at Hunter College. Dr. Koenig served in the Korean War, and was stationed at Fort Sam Houston and later at Fort Bragg. Leonard and Pauline had two daughters, Carole June Koenig, May 2, 1952, and Phyllis Ann Koenig, September 22, 1955. The family moved to Dumont, New Jersey in 1957 to raise the girls. There they lived a life fully engaged, with extended family always at hand and yearly trips with their daughters each summer. Their joy came from sharing and being with family and friends. Despite always saying that parents shouldn't chase their kids, they broke their own rule and moved to California to be near their daughters in 1984. They lived in Leisure Village in Camarillo, where they were active as ever in the community and Len found time to tutor illiterate migrant workers. Len was an accomplished violinist and pianist, having studied since age three. He was blessed with a wonderful singing voice and was active for 16 years in the Channel Island Clippers, a barbershop ensemble. When Pauline died on October 30, 2008, Phyllis and Carole moved Leonard closer to them in Los Angeles, to The Village at Sherman Oaks. Dr. Koenig is survived by his daughters, his son-in-law Reuben Aaronson, his grandchildren Sophie Jaffe, Zach Aaronson, and Kathryn Stull, his grandson-in-law Dr. Adi Jaffe, his great-grandchildren Kai Jaffe, Sonny Walker Siemenski, and Sadie Pearl Siemenski, his nieces Orlean Shimberg and Zara Abel, his great nieces Michelle Schader and Jessica Shimberg Lind, and his great nephews Mark and Brian Abel. Leonard was a delight to all those who met him. His love of life and his compassion for others shone bright and pure and inspired everyone around him. He is remembered as one of the kindest, gentlest people we've known. Words cannot convey our gratitude at receiving the gift of his presence and care. May we all remember him by striving to extend this gift of joy and love to all those we meet in his honor. Thank you Len. Services will be held at Riverside Chapel and Cemetery in Saddlebrook, New Jersey at 11am on Friday, January 13, 2012. A gathering for family and friends will take place at Avalon Bowery, 11 East First Street, New York, NY 10003."

That same week, Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch and most likely overpaid by tens of billions."

2012-01-11T00:00:00Z,"''Duck really is the other pork, isn't it?'' my friend Cathy asked last week. And of course, she's right. The two animals meander aimlessly around the barnyard, grazing and grunting and generally acting like hungry teenagers. But all the while they are building up a formidable cushion of sweet fat that has the miraculous quality of improving just about any food it touches. No wonder Momofuku Ssam Bar settled on duck as a focus for its lunch menu last spring. That restaurant didn't come into its own until it introduced its bo ssam dinners, where groups can feast on a whole pork shoulder slowly roasted until it is as spoonable and irresistible as cake frosting. What do you do after you've started a citywide pork frenzy? Rotisserie duck wouldn't strike everybody as the obvious answer, but it's the one that occurred to Ryan Miller, Ssam's chef de cuisine. Whole roast ducks are served to groups, bo ssam-style, but the solo diner can get a few slices in a bowl with rice and watercress. And the Ssam Bar team took advantage of this great new supply of cooking fat to come up with a few other duck-centric menu items. In the early days, the restaurant called this its Duckaholic Lunch, but that name seems to have passed out of use."

2012-01-12T00:00:00Z,"Adele's ''21'' (XL/Columbia) is officially the fastest-selling record in seven years, so it's not a surprise that this week the album tops Billboard's chart for the 15th time. What is notable -- and a relief for the music industry -- is that it continues to rack up significant sales at a time of year that has been embarrassingly slow in recent years. Adele's album sold 124,000 copies last week, according to Nielsen SoundScan. That is a healthy number in any week. But it's miraculous given the abysmal sales last January and February, when the industry's record for the lowest sales for a No. 1 album was broken again and again buy a string of releases, culminating with just over 40,000 sales for Amos Lee's ''Mission Bell.'' Once again, Adele's success is giving the music business something to celebrate."

This show at La MaMa E.T.C. opens in smoky darkness as a band called the Natural Born Chillers lays down a pounding bass line while two silhouetted figures dance.

It will be a trip of cheap hotels and high hopes, cramped rental cars and unexpectedly good seats at the game. The men - they will be joined by two pals in Milwaukee - have agreed to create a Titletown travelogue. Their hopes are to stay friends, keep their jobs and, well, see the Giants win.

In a newsletter sent to friends and colleagues and some journalists on Tuesday night about her current projects, Ms. Roth wrote that there should be news shortly on ''Leap of Faith'' and that ''hopefully'' it will open in the spring. The musical, which is expected to star four-time Tony Award nominee Raul Esparza as an evangelical con man, has been rumored recently as the next tenant for the St. James Theater, given the possibility that its current musical, ''On A Clear Day You Can See Forever,'' will close soon. ''On A Clear Day,'' starring Harry Connick Jr., opened in December to mostly negative reviews and has been selling modestly at the box office.

Pops of maroon (on a printed sheer dress) and a greenish mustard (on a ruched skirt dress) emerge among all of the black, white and gray, carrying over into accessories. A soon to be coveted pointy-toe heel with mesh detailing and tight ankle strap demonstrates Wang's ability to evolve ideas from one season to the next.

Over many visits and phone conversations, Robbins explored Clark's life behind bars and her slow transformation from unrepentant young radical to a reflective, deeply regretful model inmate. Clark talks a great deal about the importance of her relationship with her daughter - who was 11 months old at the time of the crime - in changing her. And the role her parents played in nurturing that relationship."

Broadway producers usually delay such announcements until a couple of days after the current show has posted a closing notice, but in this case the ''Faith'' producers quickly announced their plans for the St. James, even as the producers of ''On a Clear Day'' were notifying cast members and investors. They did so because word has been spreading that their show would open at the St. James and that ''On a Clear Day'' would close. It will have played for two and a half months when it closes on Jan. 29. ''Leap of Faith'' will star Raúl Esparza as a con man who faces a Kansas sheriff (played by Jessica Phillips) as he tries to fleece townspeople. ... To no one's surprise, Disney Theatrical Productions has announced that Jeremy Jordan, who earned good notices when the musical ''Newsies'' played at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J., last summer, will star in the Broadway version, opening at the Nederlander Theater on March 15.

Today, with tickets available online and frequent-flier miles accruing with every credit-card purchase, fans can dare to dream a little more boldly. Six members of a Chatham, N.J., softball team - a mix of lawyers, Wall Streeters and computer software salesmen - are set to travel to Lambeau Field for Sunday's showdown between the Giants and the Packers. It will be a trip of cheap hotel rooms and high hopes, cramped rental cars and unexpectedly good seats at the game. The men - they will be joined by two pals in Milwaukee - have agreed to create a Titletown travelogue. Their hopes are to stay friends, keep their jobs and, well, see the Giants win. A Giants-Packers playoff game was even more improbable in 2008 than it was this season. For the Giants to get to Green Bay, they had to win road playoff games against Tampa Bay and heavily favored Dallas. So the idea of going to Green Bay wasn't even on my radar. Until the Giants beat the Cowboys, that is, and Wilson, my law school roommate, called to say he had an extra ticket. Luckily my wife understood, and I was able to find a Sunday morning flight that got me into Milwaukee in time to drive to Green Bay with Wilson, his wife, Lisa, and one of her good friends."

(49) LET ME DOWN EASY Anna Deavere Smith, below, examines human resilience through the lens of the national debate on health care in this ''Great Performances'' presentation, taped in February at Arena Stage in Washington. From a roster of 300 people interviewed on three continents Ms. Smith depicts 19 characters, including a rodeo bull rider, a New Orleans doctor during Hurricane Katrina, former Gov. Ann Richards of Texas and the cyclist Lance Armstrong. ''Let Me Down Easy'' was inspired by Ms. Smith's work at the Yale School of Medicine, where she was a visiting professor. ''Instead of devising an organized primer on issues pertaining to health care in America,'' Charles Isherwood wrote in The New York Times when he reviewed this one-woman show in October 2009, ''Ms. Smith has created a loosely framed but vivid compendium of life experienced at its extremes, drawn about equally from the suffering and the ministering sides of the story.'' 8 A.M. (TCM) THE APARTMENT (1960) Five Oscars -- including best picture, best director (Billy Wilder) and best screenplay (Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond) -- were bestowed on this romantic comedy starring Jack Lemmon as an aspiring executive who lets his bosses use his apartment for assignations, only to fall for the big chief's mistress (Shirley MacLaine, left with Lemmon). Lemmon and Ms. MacLaine also earned Oscar nominations. The film kicks off a daylong tribute to bachelorhood, which continues with ''Any Wednesday'' (1966), about a businessman (Dean Jones) who catches his boss (Jason Robards) keeping a mistress (Jane Fonda) in the company apartment, at 9:15; ''Sunday in New York'' (1963), about a philandering pilot (Cliff Robertson) who becomes moral when his sister (Ms. Fonda) contemplates a premarital fling, at 11:15; ''Boys' Night Out'' (1962), in which a sociology student (Kim Novak) works as a kept woman to four friends (James Garner, Tony Randall, Howard Duff and Howard Morris), at 1:15 p.m.; ''Bachelor in Paradise'' (1961), with Bob Hope as an author who seduces suburban women (Lana Turner and Paula Prentiss) for a new book, at 3:30; and ''The Tender Trap'' (1955), with Frank Sinatra as a swinging theater agent who finds love with an actress (Debbie Reynolds) immune to his charms, at 5:30."

And weekends meant diving into the delightful late-night abyss of monster movies like ''Them!'' and ''The Thing From Another World.'' And I don't know about you, but I (mostly) dream in black and white. Even our first forays into writing and drawing were in black and white (or black and buff, if your grammar school went for the cheap paper).

When economists estimate the elasticity of father-son income to be 0.5, it means that for every 1 percent increase in a father's income, his sons' income can be expected to increase by about 0.5 percent. It does not mean that if one man earns $100,000 more than another, his sons would earn $50,000 more on average than the sons of the poorer man."

Seattle's passing game was a donkey cart compared to the Drew Brees Lamborghini, but the Seahawks made the most of their few assets: a bruising running back, a defense full of sure tacklers and a fiery coach, fresh from the college ranks, who provided an extra jolt of rah-rah motivation. Seattle stunned the defending-champion Saints, proving that discipline, determination and home-field advantage can still defeat one of the N.F.L.'s next-gen passing games. Once in a while, anyway."

Transportation officials said it was the best alternative to their standard approach of sending workers in to repair tracks while the trains were still running, usually on weekends. Better, they argued, to do all the work at once rather than a little at a time.

(TCM) STARRING SPENCER TRACY Katharine Hepburn, who starred in nine films with Tracy and had a relationship with him for 25 years, called him ''the greatest movie actor'' and said that she had heard that Laurence Olivier, Lee Strasberg and David Lean agreed. Tracy seemed a natural on the screen and would advise young actors, ''Never let them catch you at it'' and ''Show up on time, know your lines and don't bump into the furniture.'' But if acting was easy, life was not. Born in 1900, Tracy died at 67 after years of depression and alcoholism, and the cause of his afflictions was never clear to those closest to him. Hepburn surmised it was his Roman Catholic guilt. Tracy never divorced his wife, and he and Hepburn were able to keep their liaison private with the cooperation of the news media. Tracy was nominated for nine Oscars, including a posthumous nod for ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' which he finished only 15 days before dying of a heart attack; he won for ''Captains Courageous'' and ''Boys Town.'' This tribute begins with ''Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo'' (1944), about the first American strike on Japan in retaliation for the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It continues with ''Adam's Rib'' (1949), with Tracy and Hepburn, above, as husband-and-wife lawyers on opposite sides of an explosive case, at 10:30; ''The Last Hurrah'' (1958), about a longtime mayor up for re-election, at 12:15 a.m.; ''Father's Little Dividend'' (1951), the sequel to ''Father of the Bride,'' in which Tracy's curmudgeonly patriarch copes with becoming a grandfather, at 2:30; and ''Cass Timberlane'' (1947), about an aging judge who sets tongues wagging when he marries a young beauty (Lana Turner) from the wrong side of the tracks, at 4.

The orchestra's longtime conductor, Benjamin Zander, above, who is also a motivational speaker and the conductor of the Boston Philharmonic, said he had been fired for hiring the videographer, Peter E. Benjamin, The Boston Globe reported. The conservatory acknowledged that Mr. Zander, 72, stopped working there on Thursday, the day it said a ''senior member of the faculty'' had been disciplined for hiring Mr. Benjamin. It did not identify the faculty member, but The Globe said it was Mr. Zander. Mr. Zander conducted the Youth Philharmonic Orchestra, which is part of the conservatory's preparatory division, serving students ages 5 to 18. A letter went out to 6,500 parents of past and present students of the prep school describing the matter so they could ask their children about any incidents. None were reported. Mr. Benjamin was banned from the conservatory, said a spokeswoman, Karen Schwartzman. He also recorded a class taught by Mr. Zander at the Walnut Hill School, an affiliate of the conservatory in Natick, Mass., she said. In December, she said, someone reported his presence at the conservatory. He had been videotaping the orchestra since about 2002. Mr. Zander did not respond to a phone message left at his office on Friday. ''It's a tragedy, an absolute tragedy, that I've been fired for an absolute nothing,'' he told The Globe. He said Mr. Benjamin's conviction had come nearly 20 years ago. ''He's been blameless for 20 years,'' Mr. Zander added. Mr. Benjamin told The Associated Press that Mr. Zander's reported firing was ''a huge overreaction.''"

George McClellan was at best a reluctant warrior, gave rise to a growing claque of congressional critics. On Dec. 10, 1861, they had established the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, designed to examine every aspect of the war effort and empowered to ""send for person and papers"" as needed. Far from being a dispassionate check on the Executive Branch, however, the committee was, from the very beginning, a tool for partisan politics, a weapon forged out of, in Senator Charles Sumner's words, ""a strong desire to hold someone responsible"" for the Union Army's recent misfortunes."

2012-01-15T17:00:21Z,"Might the miserly use of neural resources be one of the essential keys to understanding how brains make sense of the world? Some recent work in computational and cognitive neuroscience suggests that it is indeed the frugal use of our native neural capacity (the inventive use of restricted ""neural bandwidth,"" if you will) that explains how brains like ours so elegantly make sense of noisy and ambiguous sensory input. That same story suggests, intriguingly, that perception, understanding and imagination, which we might intuitively consider to be three distinct chunks of our mental machinery, are inextricably tied together as simultaneous results of a single underlying strategy known as ""predictive coding."" This strategy saves on bandwidth using (who would have guessed it?) one of the many technical wheezes that enable us to economically store and transmit pictures, sounds and videos using formats such as JPEG and MP3."

Six members of a Chatham, N.J., softball team - a mix of lawyers, Wall Streeters and computer software salesmen - are set to travel to Lambeau Field for Sunday's showdown between the Giants and the Packers. It will be a trip of cheap hotel rooms and high hopes, cramped rental cars and unexpectedly good seats at the game.

2012-01-15T00:00:00Z,"KANTOR--Norman. 1927 2012. Born and raised in Plainfield, NJ to Abraham and Rose Kantor. He graduated from Plainfield High School in 43 and Cornell University in '47. He also played football (QB) at Georgia Tech for a year during ROTC in 45 (not the Bulldogs best year). He was a long-time resident of Westfield, NJ and New York City. He is predeceased by his wife Margaretha of 42 years and his brother, Marvin and two sisters, Miriam and Leonore. He is survived by his two children, Steven Kantor (who resides with his wife Jane in New York City) and Clarissa Taylor (who resides with her husband BJ in Westfield). He also is survived by his four grandchildren who he adored Chloe, Caroline, Ben and Jack as well as his devoted friend of recent years Andrea Berger. In 1960, Norm took over United Supply Co. from his father and grew it into the largest family-owned HVAC and plumbing supply house in NJ. Known nationally throughout the industry as a great innovator, Norm introduced the first retail plumbing showrooms, Kitchen & BathWorks, in 1982. The company is celebrating 100 years of success and continues to be owned and run by the family an accomplishment in which he took great pride. But his priorities were never financial success, they were much richer goals and, by example, he taught us all. He saw everyone as a friend and treated everyone with dignity, respect and empathy. Each person he met was important to him and if they had time to listen, he had a story for them sometimes even if they didn't have time to listen. Optimism was his religion. He taught us life was a wonderful gift and each day was another chance to do good and enjoy it. He put family and friends first and as everyone he met quickly became his friend, his life was busy and full until his last months. Norm also was gifted with many passions and talents. A jack-of-all-trades, he was an accomplished fine artist and sculptor, a film producer (Pretty Boy Floyd, Black Like Me), and a great writer who never published. He had a great love for and knowledge of tennis and Shakespeare. He was a memorable dancer (crazy legs) but not a great singer although that never stopped him. He was truly one of those rare people who lived his life the way we all hope to, but rarely do with unstoppable optimism, an undeniably warm smile and happy laughter through thick and thin. This was his gift to us all. We love you Dad"

They started jamming together at parties, realized they had a lot in common and ultimately settled any remaining differences in a drum war in front of the Ballroom, a local cultural arts space, late one night during an open-house weekend hosted by Chinati, the foundation created by the artist Donald Judd.

Today, it is a haven for artists, environmentalists and local foods activists. Despite all this activity, the neighborhood is serene: mesquite trees -- the product of regular community plantings -- droop over narrow sidewalks, which wind past painted murals; sometimes the only sound is the crackle of lizards darting over the trees' dry pods.

She served on the Museum's Community Committee for over a decade in capacities including cultural tours, fund raising for the annual Museum Ball, and originating the Women in the Arts Program. An avid traveler, she explored many countries on five continents, and transmitted her love of travel to her husband and son. With an extremely generous heart and a genuine love of people, she made friends everywhere and captured the hearts of all whom she encountered. She filled her family and friends with joy and kindness, and so while her loss is deeply felt, she has left the world a sweeter place. A Memorial Service will be held on Saturday, February 4 from 2-3pm in the chapel at Green-Wood Cemetery, 500 25th St., Brooklyn, NY."

From Friday night, when the world's top riders came out of the chutes, to Sunday afternoon, when Cody Nance of Paris, Tenn., took first place on Sticker Shock, the dirt-flinging, cowboy-tossing spectacle -- born, it is said, in 16th-century Mexico -- lived up to its trademarked name as the Toughest Sport on Earth. For those unfamiliar with such things, the Professional Bull Riders -- also known as P.B.R. -- have been around since 1992 and, each year since, have held events at locations around the country, from Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Tex., to the Pit in Albuquerque, N.M.

She studied at Barnard College and Black Mountain College, an institution celebrated as a refuge for major European artists fleeing fascism, and later lived in New York and Pawling. She is preceded in death by her husbands, Tasker Howard, a renowned jewelry designer, and Albert Halper, a distinguished novelist and playwright, as well as by her parents, her brothers Harrison Tweed Blaine and Graham Burt Blaine, Jr., and by her sisters Katherine Winthrop Blaine Swan and Charlotte Blaine Vaughn. Lorna is survived by her stepson Thomas Halper and her step granddaughter Pauline Halper and by several nieces and nephews. Lorna's paintings, drawings, and sculptures have been exhibited nationally and internationally, and are housed in many private and public collections, perhaps most prominently at the Black Mountain College Museum and Art Center. Her work is characterized by a technical virtuosity that never called attention to itself, a sensitive appreciation of the past that fed a bold insistence on trying new things, and a matchless integrity that left her impervious to the appeals of passing ephemera. She was always and in all things very much her own person, and yet she was entirely without arrogance or self-righteousness and known for her extraordinary generosity. Her friends and family regard her as unique and therefore unforgettable and irreplaceable."

For example, a treated metallic tweed T-shirt revived a mainstay staple, while an entrancing kaleidoscopic print (evident on everything from dresses to shorts, in muted hues of browns and blush inspired by the muddied, grittier side of India) demonstrates the progress Mr. Gurung has made evolving beyond his pretty confections for the party set.

2012-01-15T00:00:00Z,"It's hard to believe that anyone but scholars of modern literature or paid critics have read W. H. Auden's dramatic poem ''The Age of Anxiety'' all the way through, even though it won a Pulitzer Prize in 1948, the year after it was published. It is a difficult work -- allusive, allegorical, at times surreal. But more to the point, it's boring. The characters meet, drink, talk and walk around; then they drink, talk and walk around some more. They do this for 138 pages; then they go home. Auden's title, though: that people know. From the moment it appeared, the phrase has been used to characterize the consciousness of our era, the awareness of everything perilous about the modern world: the degradation of the environment, nuclear energy, religious fundamentalism, threats to privacy and the family, drugs, pornography, violence, terrorism. Since 1990, it has appeared in the title or subtitle of at least two dozen books on subjects ranging from science to politics to parenting to sex (''Mindblowing Sex in the Real World: Hot Tips for Doing It in the Age of Anxiety''). As a sticker on the bumper of the Western world, ''the age of anxiety'' has been ubiquitous for more than six decades now."

The year began in inspiriting fashion, with the Green Mountain Project's superb annual presentation of Vespers music by Monteverdi, sponsored by Trinity Church at the Church of St. Jean Baptiste. Then, days later, a bleak midwinter seemed to settle in, when Trinity declared a hiatus in its own music program, suspending the activities of its excellent Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra at least until March. Now, on Tuesday, the Juilliard School is announcing a $20 million gift to endow its graduate-level program in historical performance.

2012-01-16T15:00:06Z,"In a year in which nine of the top 10 movies at the box office have been sequels, perhaps it was appropriate that Ricky Gervais served up a slightly less compelling version of last year's Golden Globe Awards. NBC said on Monday that its live Globes telecast on Sunday night drew 16.8 million viewers, down a whisker from last year's 17 million. About 4 percent fewer people in the target demographic, adults age 18 to 49, tuned in, as measured by raw ratings points. (A 5.0 this year compared to a 5.2 last year.) NBC had heavily promoted Mr. Gervais's acerbic comedic style as a reason to watch. As promised, he delivered a crude monologue - a repeat performance of 2011, when his remarks drew gasps - but shocking people twice with the same shtick is hard to pull off. Other factors possibly affecting interest in the show: NBC has limited ability to promote itself (the network's overall schedule remains in the ratings basement), and the Globes also celebrated a batch of smaller films like ""The Artist"" that have produced limited box-office results. Still, the telecast was a win for NBC, delivering the network's biggest audience, excluding sporting events, since last year's Globes."

2012-01-16T11:06:23Z,"Jon Huntsman had a more impressive resume, a better policy shop, better odds in November and stronger conservative bona fides than many of the candidates vying for the Republican nomination. But several of them are still running while he's dropped out, and that almost all of them enjoyed temporary surges in the polls while he always languished at the bottom of the pack. For this, there's plenty of blame to go around: Huntsman can blame the mainstream media, for constantly depicting him as the ""sane Republican"" tragically doomed to irrelevance by the folly of his party's base; he can blame his own advisers, for embracing that self-defeating image and trying to re-run John McCain's 2000 campaign in a very different climate; he can blame Republican voters for dismissing him because of symbolism and identity politics rather than judging him on his record; he can blame conservative machers and opinion-makers for doing the same. (He can even blame his father, who declined - or wasn't asked, or both - to play Sheldon Adelson to his son's cash-poor campaign.)"

All of these operations and many more require a valid internal passport, a peculiar document that may be the most significant vestige of the U.S.S.R. in modern Russian society.Back when we lived behind the Iron Curtain, these passports entitled us to travel only within the confines of the Soviet Union. Anyone lucky enough to be allowed to travel abroad was issued a special foreign-travel passport just for the occasion and had to surrender it upon returning home. When Russians acquired the right to travel freely, they got to keep their foreign-travel passports. But the internal passport refused to die. So now each adult Russian citizen has two passports. The documents look alike, except that the one for internal use is printed on lighter paper stock, making it feel less substantial."

This openness might seem odd given what Square does. It manages more than $2 billion a year in credit card transactions made through mobile phones. But the company is set up this way by Jack Dorsey, Square's chief executive and co-founder, for a reason: to promote trust and transparency in its employees, which it hopes will translate to its customers. Design, he believes, has the power to determine a distinct mind-set, something he needs if Square is to succeed as a mobile payment system."

Now they have to worry about an offense that can win a shootout with one of the game's most productive teams? Uh-oh. Until the divisional round, the 49ers were generally thought of as an outstanding defensive team - Justin Smith is the terrorizing pass rusher who dominated the Saints' offensive line - with an offense that too often settled for field goals. So much for that. Now San Francisco has a balanced offense and a shutdown defense."

''Contraband,'' starring Mark Wahlberg as an ex-smuggler forced to fix a botched drug deal, was No. 1 and took in about $24 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. Universal Pictures and Relativity Media spent about $25 million to make the film. Disney's ''Beauty and the Beast 3-D'' was second; the gussied-up version of this 22-year-old film sold about $18.5 million in tickets.

A few days ago Mr. Hamm let it slip in a podcast interview that the long-awaited season premiere of ''Mad Men,'' the AMC period drama on which he plays the advertising executive Don Draper, would be shown on March 25. Though a few days of radio silence from the network followed Mr. Hamm can now wipe those beads of sweat from his Brylcreemed brow: AMC has confirmed the news, announcing over the weekend that Season 5 of ''Mad Men'' would begin on that date, with a two-hour episode written by the series' creator, Matthew Weiner, and directed by Jennifer Getzinger, who directed the episode ''The Suitcase'' last season. For fans of ''Mad Men'' this premiere has been a long time coming.

Corneliani started off the Milan season with a group of guys hitting the runway en masse in gray flannel double-breasted suits with tonal shirts and ties; Brioni, newly part of France's PPR family of luxury fashion houses, showed a boardroom-appropriate light gray version with a faint windowpane during its presentation in, fittingly, an ersatz boardroom; and Massimiliano Giornetti featured a sexy, low-slung four-button navy take in his show for Salvatore Ferragamo. Meanwhile, Canali favored a higher, more dandified 6-button model in mourning stripes with a contrasting velvet collar. Paul Surridge's first collection at Z Zegna also preferred this higher button stance - a crisp white shirt and dark tie peeked out just the slightest from underneath the jacket. The sharp lapels of the graphic Prince of Wales plaid suit in Sarah Burton's Alexander McQueen collection looked positively lethal. And Giorgio Armani, always seeking perfection, showed off his model's gym-toned body with a lower cut and softer shoulder. Definitely a powerful suit."

But, experts say, creating them will be challenging. Other than intensive hospital-based programs, few proven models exist for helping children and adolescents achieve and maintain a healthier weight, and researchers do not even fully understand the factors that contributed to the rapid rise in childhood obesity in recent years.

2012-01-17T00:00:00Z,"Devotees of early music in New York may be experiencing whiplash. The year began in inspiriting fashion, with the Green Mountain Project's superb annual presentation of Vespers music by Monteverdi, sponsored by Trinity Church at the Church of St. Jean Baptiste. Then, days later, a bleak midwinter seemed to settle in, when Trinity declared a hiatus in its own music program, suspending the activities of its excellent Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra at least until March. Now, on Tuesday, the Juilliard School is announcing a $20 million gift to endow its graduate-level program in historical performance. The sheer size of the gift is enough to make heads snap in the early-music world, whose practitioners typically struggle to stay a step ahead of poverty. The donor is Bruce Kovner, the chairman of the school's board, who recently retired as chairman of the $10 billion hedge fund Caxton Associates. Mr. Kovner, 66, has already financed the curriculum in period performance, which began in 2009, through its development and several academic years costing, he said in a telephone interview, $500,000 to $1 million each. The program, which is directed by the English violinist Monica Huggett and has attracted guest luminaries like the conductor-instrumentalists William Christie and Jordi Savall, has had a significant impact on the New York scene by presenting its own public concerts and furnishing performers for groups like Trinity's."

2012-01-17T00:00:00Z,"In a year in which nine of the top 10 movies at the box office have been sequels, perhaps it was appropriate that Ricky Gervais served up a slightly less compelling version of last year's Golden Globe Awards. NBC said on Monday that its live Globes telecast on Sunday night drew 16.8 million viewers, down a whisker from last year's 17 million. About 4 percent fewer people in the target demographic, adults age 18 to 49, tuned in, as measured by raw ratings points. (A 5.0 this year compared to a 5.2 last year.) NBC had heavily promoted Mr. Gervais's acerbic comedic style as a reason to watch. As promised, he delivered a crude monologue - a repeat performance of 2011, when his remarks drew gasps - but shocking people twice with the same shtick is hard to pull off. Other factors possibly affecting interest in the show: NBC has limited ability to promote itself (the network's overall schedule remains in the ratings basement), and the Globes also celebrated a batch of smaller films like ''The Artist'' that have produced limited box-office results. Still, the telecast was a win for NBC, delivering the network's biggest audience, excluding sporting events, since last year's Globes. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Called ''Battleground,'' the new series is described as a faux documentary-style political drama-comedy set in Wisconsin-- which in real life has emerged as a frontline in combat between liberals and conservatives since Republican governor Scott Walker took office a year ago. The new show, which is to have 13 episodes, will be directed by J.D. Walsh, a Wisconsin native known from acting appearances in ''Two and a Half Men,'' and will be produced by Marc Webb (''The Amazing Spider-Man'') and Hagai Shaham (''The Details''). Hulu is said to be aiming ''Battleground'' at the same kind of audience that watches popular programs like ''The Office'' and ''The Colbert Report.''"

Born Hope Chandler in 1921 in New York City, Hearst was a child actress and model, and famously graced a 1937 cover of LIFE Magazine as the ""Prettiest Girl in Paradise."" In 1938, in New York's Grace Church, she married the late David Whitmire Hearst, son of William Randolph Hearst and a vice president and director of Hearst Corporation. The young couple moved to Beverly Hills, Calif., where Hearst's husband began his career with the Los Angeles Evening Herald-Express. Hearst gave birth to two children, Millicent Hearst Boudjakdji and David Whitmire Hearst, Jr. ""Together, David and Hope Hearst exhibited the highest level of support as Hearst Corporation grew and changed,"" said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., CEO of Hearst Corporation. ""And long after her husband's death, Hope regularly assumed the role of cheerleader, encouraging Hearst management in every way."" After her husband's death in 1986, Hearst moved permanently to Hawaii, a place the Hearsts first visited as a newly married couple. She loved Hawaii and her many friends and family members there. Hearst was happiest surrounded by her family and adored pets in the living room of her Honolulu home. ""She was a remarkable, loving, and joyful woman,"" said her granddaughter Anissa B. Balson, a director of Hearst Corporation and a trustee of the trust established under the will of William Randolph Hearst. ""We will all miss her very, very much."" Hearst is survived by her brother, Warren Coley of Hawaii; her son, David W. Hearst, Jr., of California and Hawaii; her grandchildren, Balson, Cherif Boudjakdji and Samia Staehle; and her four great-grandchildren. In addition to her husband, she is predeceased by her daughter Boudjakdji, who was president of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, a director of Hearst Corporation and trustee of the trust established under the will of William Randolph Hearst.

2012-01-17T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (13) NUCLEAR AFTERSHOCKS In the 10 months since an earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex in Japan (above, a woman who lived near the plant being checked for radiation), that country has closed all but a handful of its 54 reactors. Germany has decided to phase out its 17 nuclear power plants by 2022. Should the United States follow suit? In this ''Frontline'' episode, Miles O'Brien examines the future of nuclear energy around the world and asks whether any of the 104 reactors in the United States could suffer a Fukushima-type accident. He also investigates a controversial decision facing nuclear regulators: whether to relicense the nearly 40-year-old Indian Point plant, 38 miles north of Manhattan. Critics, like Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, insist that the risks are too great. But proponents, including former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, argue that the plant should remain open because it provides about a quarter of New York City and Westchester County's power while producing few greenhouse gas emissions. 2 P.M. (HBO) TEMPLE GRANDIN (2010) Claire Danes earned an Emmy for her role as Ms. Grandin, the autistic animal behaviorist who helps design slaughterhouses. The director, Mick Jackson, who also won an Emmy, used snapshot images that track Ms. Grandin's self-perceptions from her condition's early diagnosis through her turbulent school years and the unwavering support of her mother (Julia Ormond), aunt (Catherine O'Hara) and science teacher (David Strathairn). ''Hers is a tale that could be easily played up for drama, intrigue and weepy reconciliations, but this narrative is loyal to Ms. Grandin's credo: emotions are secondary to tangible results,'' Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. ''And the result is a movie that is funny, instructive and also intangibly charming.''"

Leading the list, not surprisingly, was ''Someone Like You,'' a hit single from the CD ''21,'' which was chosen by one in four karaoke singers and is also up for a Grammy next month in the best pop performance category. In second place, with 10 percent of the three million total performances tabulated, was her cover version of Bob Dylan's ''Make You Feel My Love,'' a track from her debut CD, ''19.'' The top non-Adele karaoke song was ''Heroes,'' a track written by David Bowie and Brian Eno in the 1970s that enjoyed a resurgence of popularity after it was featured on the television program ''The X Factor.''

(BBC America) MISTRESSES This soap opera about four women in Bristol, England, balancing friendship and extramarital intrigue, left American viewers dangling when Season 2 wrapped in May 2009. Now it returns for a four-episode finale. When last we saw the girlfriends, Katie (Sarah Parish), the doctor who helped her terminally ill married lover commit suicide in Season 1 (and then went on to have an affair with his son and then with an old, also-married flame), was about to find out if her latest beau would sweep her off to Australia in an act of forgiveness. Trudi (Sharon Small), who thought her husband had died in the terror attacks of Sept. 11 and discovered that he was in fact still alive, had gotten married to a man who also wasn't what he seemed. Jessica (Shelley Conn, above), a pregnant event planner in an open marriage, learned that her spouse had decided to be monogamous. Or so he said. And Siobhan (Orla Brady) was relegated to single-mother status after struggling with infertility in her marriage, then getting pregnant by a colleague -- which sent her husband packing. In this Season 3 premiere the women are summoned to Katie's house, where their icy demeanor suggests that they are friends no more. Joanna Lumley joins the cast as Vivienne, Katie's imperious mother. 1 P.M. (HBO Signature) SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE (2003) In this double bill from the director Nancy Meyers, a music executive in his 60s (Jack Nicholson) with a fondness for young women finds the rug pulled out from under him when he falls for the mother (Diane Keaton, above) of a woman he's dating (Amanda Peet). Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that Mr. Nicholson and Ms. Keaton sparred ''with the freedom of professionals with nothing left to prove, and Mr. Nicholson has the gentlemanly grace to step aside and let Ms. Keaton claim the movie.'' He added, ''She in turn brings out the best in everyone around her.'' At 3:15, in ''It's Complicated,'' Meryl Streep plays Jane Adler, a successful California restaurateur who is about to settle into life as an empty nester when she is blindsided by advances from her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin), who had left her a decade earlier for a pretty young thing (Lake Bell). Steve Martin is thrown into the mix as the architect overseeing the renovation of Jane's house, and he is not without his own charms. The truth, Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times, is ''that everyone needs a little coddling, which could be the key to Ms. Meyers's peculiar talent: She pampers her audience shamelessly.''"

2012-01-18T00:00:00Z,"The series premiere of ''Alcatraz'' -- which features a crack investigative team tracking former inmates of the infamous prison -- managed to capture a large portion of the broadcast audience for Fox on Monday night. The new drama averaged 10 million viewers and outperformed the premiere of the previous time slot occupant, ''Terra Nova,'' in the 18-to-49 demographic, according to Nielsen data. The numbers also remained consistent throughout the two-hour period, suggesting viewers liked what they saw. But no show could hold a candle to the overall audience numbers for NBC's ''Betty White's 90th Birthday: A Tribute to America's Golden Girl.'' An average of 13.9 million people tuned in to the 90-minute special, although the audience skewed older.

2012-01-18T00:00:00Z,"ASCHKENASY--Herbert. Herbert (Herb) Aschkenasy passed away on January 12, 2012, while at home with his family by his side. Herb was a beloved longtime president and, most recently, chairman and CEO of Oregon Freeze Dry Inc., based in Albany, Oregon. Born in Vienna, Austria, Herb was nine years old when the Aschkenasy family came to New York in 1941. He grew up in the Bronx and attended the Bronx High School of Science, graduated from the City University of New York (now City College of New York) with a Bachelor of Science, received a Ph.D. in chemistry from the Polytechnic Institute of New York, and did postdoctoral research at Cambridge University. He served in the U.S. Army during the Korean conflict. Herb married Ruth Kurland on July 11, 1954 in The Bronx, New York. Ruth and their three children survive, Leah Reid of New York City, David Aschkenasy of San Diego, and Dr. Miriam Aschkenasy of Massachusetts, as well as four grandchildren. Herb's parents preceded him in death. Herb and Ruth lived in Philadelphia, Kentucky, and Wisconsin while Herb held technical, sales, and management positions with Celanese Corporation and Rohm & Haas. Herb transferred to Oregon Freeze Dry in 1981 from the Chemical Group of Philip Morris Industrial, where he served as president. Oregon Freeze Dry Foods (as it was then called) had fallen on hard times. After a period of rebuilding the company, in 1986 he led a management team in the purchase of Oregon Freeze Dry (OFD) from Philip Morris Incorporated. Herb remained president until he was appointed chairman in January of 2011. Under his leadership the company grew by adding facilities in Albany and acquiring companies with manufacturing facilities in England and Denmark, and establishing a sales office in Japan. Herb was especially proud of the growth of the company's Mountain House brand and when the OFD logo was added to packaging for General Mills Berry Burst Cheerios, Lipton cup-a-noodle soup, and most recently Costco's Kirkland Signature brand of real sliced fruit. Herb received a gubernatorial appointment to the board of the State-owned workers' compensation company (SAIF) and was elected chairman from 1988 through 1993. He was subsequently appointed to the Oregon State Board of Higher Education in September 1993 and served until September 2001, including a term as president. He was also on the board of Associated Oregon Industries, was a past chairman of the Northwest Food Processors Association, and served on other religious and charitable boards. In November of 2011 his alma mater, City College of New York, awarded Herb the Townsend Harris Medal for outstanding entrepreneurship. Herb was also a pillar of the Salem Jewish Congregation (Temple Beth Sholom), serving as president and trustee for many years. His contributions to Jewish Life and presence in Salem were exemplary. His commitment to the community was unconditional and honored his family heritage honorably. Herb was a respected and trusted sage to rabbis, leaders and staff. Memorial contributions may be made to OHSU Knight Cancer Institute or to Temple Beth Sholom."
2012-01-18T00:00:00Z,"After two decades of steady increases, obesity rates in adults and children in the United States have remained largely unchanged during the past 12 years, a finding that suggests national efforts at promoting healthful eating and exercise are having little effect on the overweight. Over all, 35.7 percent of the adult population and 16.9 percent of children qualify as obese, according to data gathered by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published online Tuesday by The Journal of the American Medical Association. While it is good news that the ranks of the obese in America are not growing, the data also point to the intractable nature of weight gain and signal that the country will be dealing with the health consequences of obesity for years to come."

2012-01-19T00:00:00Z,"Last week we published a case study about William Burris, one of 10 franchisees who learned that their Australia-based franchiser, Rent Your Boxes, had gone bankrupt. Mr. Burris, who had invested more than $100,000 to purchase three territories in the Washington area, rallied by creating a new company, Rent Our Boxes, for himself and his nine fellow franchisees. But getting the franchisees to agree on how to run the new company proved problematic, and Mr. Burris started thinking about going it alone. There seemed to be safety in numbers, especially if the jilted franchisees wanted to continue pursuing legal action against their original franchiser, but relations among the franchisees continued to go from bad to worse. ''You had 10 franchisees who had paid money to follow someone else's system and who expected someone else, me in this case, to do the work for them,'' said Mr. Burris, a former director of advertising and media sales at the International Franchise Association. ''In my time at the I.F.A., I learned that the No. 1 reason franchises fail is because their owners fail to market their own business.''"

Carlyle has also deliberately limited other rights of shareholders that are typically present in public companies. The question, the Deal Professor says, is whether prospective shareholders protest and refuse to participate in Carlyle's public offering. STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF"

The rodeo term is not one I have used in running my business. At least not until recently. When I started my advertising business 17 years ago in Austin, Tex., I knew I needed to learn some things about running the business. A steady diet of self-help, business and motivational books taught me just enough, and my instincts took over from there. And then luck kicked in. We eventually grew to more than $8 million a year in annual revenue. But the lingering effects of the recession left me scrambling a bit late last year when many of our clients cut their ad budgets for the second year in a row."

Since 2008, the rapper and actor has been the host for the televised nominations concert the Grammys produces in the fall. This is the first time, however, he will be asked to keep the main ceremony moving along. The awards will be announced on Feb. 12 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. CBS will broadcast the show, which will feature performances by Nicki Minaj, Foo Fighters, Taylor Swift, Kelly Clarkson, Jason Aldean and Bruno Mars. The last time the awards program had a single host was in 2005, when Queen Latifah, another rapper turned actress, played that role. In the past, the producers have relied on comedians as hosts, among them Jon Stewart, Billy Crystal, Ellen DeGeneres and Rosie O'Donnell."

Aggressively attacked by a super PAC supporting Newt Gingrich, Mr. Romney stands accused of being a rapacious capitalist intent on destroying jobs for personal gain.

2012-01-19T00:00:00Z,"9 A.M. (MoreMax) GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING (2003) This feature directorial debut from Peter Webber, based on the novel by Tracy Chevalier, imagines the life of Griet (Scarlett Johansson, right), a teenage maid in the Netherlands in the 1660s who becomes the muse for Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth) and is immortalized in one of his most famous paintings. ''Ms. Johansson is photographed so that her skin is as opalescent as her earring, but the movie is opaque,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. ''It is an earnest, obvious melodrama with no soul, filled with the longing silences that come after a sigh.'' Yet, he added, the film is ''a dexterous and absorbing visual re-creation of the lighting and the look that Vermeer achieved in his work.'' The movie received Oscar nominations for art direction, set decoration, cinematography and costume design. 9:15 A.M. (HBO2) CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS (1989) When the mistress (Anjelica Huston) of Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau, in an Oscar-nominated performance), a Manhattan ophthalmologist, threatens to go public with their affair and his unethical financial dealings, he hires his mobster brother (Jerry Orbach) to kill her in this movie from Woody Allen, who received best director and best screenplay nominations. Mr. Allen also plays Cliff Stern, a married documentarian infatuated by another woman (Mia Farrow). Sam Waterston is Judah's best friend, a rabbi; Alan Alda is a successful television producer and Cliff's brother-in-law. ''The wonder of 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' is the facility with which Mr. Allen deals with so many interlocking stories of so many differing tones and voices,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The Times. ''The film cuts back and forth between parallel incidents and between present and past with the effortlessness of a hip, contemporary Aesop.''"

Literally: This week Adele's ''21'' (XL/Columbia) notches its 16th No. 1, the first time since the ''Titanic'' soundtrack in 1998 that a release has topped the list as many times. As Billboard notes, only three albums in the last 20 years have had more weeks at No. 1: Billy Ray Cyrus's ''Some Gave All,'' which had 17 in 1992; Garth Brooks's ''Ropin' the Wind,'' with 18 in 1991 and 1992; and the soundtrack to ''The Bodyguard,'' with 20 in 1992 and 1993.) Adele's ''21,'' out since last February and a safe bet to sweep the Grammy Awards next month, sold 104,000 copies last week, according to Nielsen SoundScan, bringing the album's total to just over six million. Its weekly sales have not dipped below 100,000 since August. It was also only a matter of time before an Adele song also reclaimed No. 1 on Billboard's digital songs chart. This week ''Set Fire to the Rain,'' the third single from ''21,'' rose two spots to the top with 193,000 downloads, while last week's No. 1 download, Jason Mraz's ''I Won't Give Up,'' fell to No. 9 with 127,000 sales, a 44 percent drop."
