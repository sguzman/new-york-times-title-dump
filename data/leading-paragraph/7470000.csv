2011-03-01T00:00:00Z,"BATTAILE--Janet White. A memorial service was held at St. Columba's Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, February 24, to honor a dear colleague and friend, Janet White Battaile, a longtime editor of The New York Times. Ms. Battaile, 63, died on Friday, February 18, succumbing to multiple myeloma after keeping the disease at bay through successful, and at times experimental, drug treatments for nearly 11 years. Throughout a decade since the diagnosis in 2000, Ms. Battaile displayed courage and tenacity, using her journalistic reportorial skills to research and pursue new and innovative medicines. For example, she first volunteered for a clinical trial of thalidomide at the Mayo Clinic, becoming a ""data point"" in the study that led to approval of the drug as the first new myeloma treatment in many years. It wasn't until this last year that Ms. Battaile was unable to fend off the disease's progression. In her professional life, Ms. Battaile worked for more than 25 years as an editor for The New York Times, in its Washington bureau, and earlier for its News Service. Before she took early retirement in 2005, she worked with The Times's video and multi-media units, after inaugurating the paper's pioneering online video endeavor, Political Points, with ABC News during the 2000 presidential election. During Ms. Battaile's tenure as a deputy editor in the Washington bureau, she shepherded and coordinated significant policy and political coverage. She oversaw national news coverage through parts of four presidential administrations, from Ronald Reagan's through George W. Bush's, and edited countless Page One articles of legislative battles in Congress over domestic issues as well as those on wars, terrorism and numerous scandals. Her colleagues tell tales like this one: She once alerted staff to missile strikes against Iraq by getting a message posted on a billboard at Camden Yards to those attending a ballgame. Throughout the impeachment scandal during the Clinton administration, Ms. Battaile coordinated news coverage of the events, editing major investigative works as well as profiles of prominent officials. She often spent hours into the late nights preparing and perfecting articles for the newspaper. Ms. Battaile was beloved by many for her attention to detail, and her deft touch that improved reporters' copy on a daily basis. She was also appreciated for her buoyant, cheerful personality, someone whose smile and laughter lifted the bureau's spirits time and again. She has been sorely missed in the bureau these last few years. After her retirement from The Times, she also wrote and edited for Politics Daily, the Web site that is part of AOL. Between her stints at The Times's News Service, which began in 1974, and her return to the newspaper's Washington bureau in 1987, Ms. Battaile served as the deputy Washington bureau chief of The Dallas Morning News from 1981-1987. Ms. Battaile began her career with The Associated Press, in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1969. She was transferred to the New York General Desk in 1971, and worked there until she joined The Times. She was born in Winchester, VA, on March 2, 1947. Ms. Battaile was educated at St. Catherine's School in Richmond, VA, and Lake Erie College in Painesville, OH, where she received a bachelor of arts degree in English. While there, she did a semester at the Universite de Nancy in Nancy, France. She is survived by her husband, Jerry Knight, the retired financial columnist for The Washington Post; their three children, Jesse of Salt Lake City, Erin of Yardley, PA, Marc of Parkesburg, PA; her siblings Jeannie Battaile of Winchester, VA, John Battaile of Stanardsville, VA and Lawrence Battaile of Collington, NC, and eight grandchildren."

2011-03-01T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (13); 11 P.M. (49) ME FACING LIFE: CYNTOIA'S STORY In August 2004 Cyntoia Brown, 16, shot and killed Johnny Allen, a 43-year-old Tennessee real estate agent she said had picked her up for sex. Two years later Ms. Brown -- who had been born to a 16-year-old and adopted as a toddler -- was tried as an adult, found guilty of first-degree murder and especially aggravated robbery, and sentenced to life. In this ''Independent Lens'' presentation, Daniel H. Birman follows Ms. Brown, above, for six years, starting the week she was arrested, in the hope of exposing the reasons for violence among youth. What he discovered was a history, seemingly shaped by heredity and circumstance, that had repeated itself through each generation of Ms. Brown's biological family. 5:30 P.M. (Cinemax) FUNNY PEOPLE (2009) In this film from Judd Apatow, Adam Sandler plays George Simmons, a stand-up comedian turned Hollywood star and jerk, who discovers that he has a rare, potentially fatal blood disease. Seth Rogen is Ira, the fledgling comic George hires as an assistant, who for the time being seems only too content to accept scraps from his employer. Mr. Apatow's wife, Leslie Mann, plays Laura, the love who got away from George, and the one he wants back now that he's dying. (The Apatows' daughters play Laura's children.) Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said there was ''something irritatingly self-satisfied'' about the film, partly stemming from the autobiographical touches. ''Watching 'Funny People,' you get the sense that Mr. Apatow, one of the most successful filmmakers working in Hollywood, is very happy,'' she wrote. ''Bummer.''"

The wages of celebrity are being assessed all over this city in productions that should give weighty pause to those who would be stars. Most conspicuously, there's ''Anna Nicole,'' the title character of the new opera about the perils of Ms. Smith (the chest that launched a thousand tabloid covers) and the hardest ticket in town to wrangle. But audiences are cramming into smaller theaters to watch other figures grow, shrink and generally agonize in the spotlight. Among them is one Judy Garland (incarnated with uncanny fierceness by Tracie Bennett), whose calamity-filled visit to London a few months before her death has been re-created in the inevitably titled ''End of the Rainbow'' at Trafalgar Studios."

2011-03-01T00:00:00Z,"LUBRANO--David Gordon, died on Wednesday, February 23, 2011 in Boston, MA, surrounded by his family; he was eighty years old. Mr. Lubrano was born on October 19, 1930 in Providence, RI. He completed his secondary school education at Moses Brown School in Providence. He then graduated from Brown University in 1952, where he was a member of Delta Upsilon fraternity, a writer for the school newspaper, a member of the orchestra, and on both the tennis and ski teams. In 1956, he received his Master of Business Administration degree with distinction from The Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. After college and prior to graduate school, Mr. Lubrano served in the US Army with the Military Police during the Korean conflict, where he was stationed in Seoul for which he received his combat infantry badge. He began his career as a certified public accountant for Arthur Anderson's Boston Office. He left the firm in 1968 and co-founded National Medical Care, a provider of kidney dialysis services, which ultimately went public and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. During the course of his 12 years of service at National Medical Care, Mr. Lubrano acted as Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Director of the firm. In 1980, Mr. Lubrano joined Apollo Computer Inc., one of the first vendors of graphical workstations that dominated the corporate landscape around Chelmsford, MA and helped establish Route 128 as the east coast challenger to California's Silicon Valley. He ultimatley served as its Chief Financial Officer. From 1980 to 1987, Apollo was the country's largest manufacturer of network workstations. Mr. Lubrano resigned from Apollo in 1986 to found his own venture capital firm, 21st Century Ventures Inc. Over decades, Mr. Lubrano served on the Board of Directors of numerous corporations including Staples Inc. and Bitstream Inc. He also served on the Board of Trustees of each of the educational institutions of which he was a graduate, including the Moses Brown School, Brown University, and the Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College. At the time of his death, Mr. Lubrano served on the Board of Trustees of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Mr. Lubrano was the son of the late Jack and Ruth Lubrano of Providence, RI. Before he was stricken by Mesothelioma in 2010, he fully intended to break their record for longevity (102 and 107 years, respectively.) He was predeceased by his wife of 43 years, Jean Hambleton Lubrano, with whom he raised a family of five. Mr. Lubrano resided in Hingham, MA; Bridgton, ME; and Vero Beach, FL. For a period of time in the mid-1980's, he was the co-owner of the Pleasant Mountain Ski Resort in Bridgton, Maine and helped install the mountain's first triple chair. He was an avid skier, hiker, camper, canoeist, golfer and tennis player. He had a great love of music and was a long-time supporter of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He married Jean Keyo of Hingham, MA in 2005, and the couple split their time between Massachusetts, Maine, and Florida. In his last years, Mr. Lubrano was happiest piloting his boat, The Satin Doll, on the waters of Moose Pond in Maine with his wife. Mr. Lubrano is survived by his wife, Jean Keyo Lubrano, and his five children: Beth Dwyer (Paul) of Pembroke, MA; Stacy Lamson (Timothy) of Amesbury, MA; Steven Lubrano (Allegra) of Hanover, NH; Jennifer Clayton (Mark) of Hingham, MA; Kathryn Robinson (Kenneth) of Providence, RI; and 11 grandchildren.

Adele's new album, ""21"" (XL/Columbia), opened with 352,000 sales, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Thanks to a blitz of television appearances to promote the album, that was the best opening-week sales of any album in three months. (In the interim, there have been some painfully low numbers.) And her debut album, ""19,"" bolted 34 spots to No. 16, with 18,000 sales. But almost everything else on the chart is a loser. Last week's No. 1, Justin Bieber's ""Never Say Never: The Remixes"" (Island), fell to No. 2 with 102,000, a 38 percent decline, and Mr. Bieber's ""My World 2.0,"" at No. 5, lost 22 percent. Mumford & Sons' ""Sigh No More"" (Glassnote), at No. 3, dropped 46 percent; ""Now That's What I Call Music!"" Vol. 37 is No. 4 with a 38 percent loss; Bruno Mars's ""Doo-Wops & Hooligans"" (Elektra), at No. 6, lost 40 percent, and so on. Last week's numbers were higher than usual because of the traditional retail boost the week after the Grammys. But that only underlines the scale of Adele's success. On the digital singles chart, Lady Gaga's ""Born This Way,"" which was enormously popular out of the gate, lost 44 percent of its sales in its third week, with 286,000, although that was enough for it to hold at No. 1."

The roster of semi- and never-were-celebs for the 12th season of that popular reality competition may not include anyone as instantly fascinating as, say, Bristol Palin, who danced her way to a third-place finish on the show last fall, and producers were apparently unsuccessful in casting their spell over Christine O'Donnell, the Republican senatorial candidate from Delaware, to take part in the new cycle. But when the new season of ''Dancing'' makes its debut on March 21, the contestants will include Kirstie Alley, the ''Cheers'' and ''Look Who's Talking'' star; Ralph Macchio, the original ''Karate Kid''; the talk-show host Wendy Williams; the hall of fame boxer Sugar Ray Leonard; and the Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Hines Ward. The people we had to Google include Chris Jericho, a professional wrestler; Chelsea Kane, a Disney Channel actor; Kendra Wilkinson, a Playboy model and reality television star; and ''Psycho'' Mike Catherwood, a co-host of the radio program ''Loveline.'' Also competing this season is the rapper Romeo, who was scheduled to be part of the show in 2006, but dropped out because of an injury and was replaced by his father, the rapper Master P."

Their friendship had been cemented in November 1970, when they performed together at the Troubadour, the West Hollywood, Calif., club that figured prominently in the careers of some of the decade's most significant singer-songwriters. (Ms. King and Mr. Taylor, above, would reunite there in November 2007 in honor of the club's 50th anniversary.) This ''American Masters'' presentation explores that movement through archival film footage and new interviews with Ms. King, Mr. Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, David Crosby, Jackson Browne, Kris Kristofferson, Steve Martin and Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong.

True, it took hours of pushing and pressing by David Frost to get Nixon to apologize for Watergate - ""I let the American people down, and I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life"" - and he could have apologized for so much more. But watch Nixon's face. Something is there. Could it be contrition?"

2011-03-03T13:15:20Z,"There are certain things that all creative people share in common - and lately a chat with the artist Doug Aitken seems to be one of them. Aitken's 2006 book ""Broken Screen,"" which featured interviews with everyone from Robert Altman to Rem Koolhaas, challenged the convention of the linear narrative. Now, with his latest video project, Patterns & Repetitions [http://www.patternsandrepetition.com], the artist sits down with a whole new cast in an attempt to put the pieces of the creative puzzle back together again. There's Jacques Herzog on instinct and architecture; LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy on the sound of snow; and Jack White weighing in on Michelangelo as a modern-day blogger. This week, The Moment features the artist Mike Kelley talking about Detroit, his hometown. But don't be fooled by the coffee mugs and the California sunshine. Aitken doesn't do anything casually. The subtext of the conversations is nothing less than the future of art itself."

I rushed home and devoured the 17-page cover package on the Smiths, marking the 25th anniversary of ""The Queen Is Dead"" (which, interestingly, Mojo ranks as only their second-best album). Though it's largely about the rock music of years gone by, Mojo steers clear of sentimentality and cheap nostalgia by sheer, unabashed devotion to its subject.

And more important, when can they buy tickets for the first ""Star Wars"" movie to be released in 3-D? Lucasfilm and 20th Century Fox answered one of those questions on Thursday, announcing that ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,"" the first of the six space-adventure films that George Lucas and Industrial Light & Magic are converting for 3-D presentation, will be released in theaters next year on Feb. 10. In a statement, the studios said the 3-D conversion is ""being done with utmost respect for the source material, and with a keen eye for both technological considerations and artistic intentions.""

""Could there be a starker illustration of just how mistaken the neocon-Israeli conflation always was?""

And now - as the muse for Formichetti's new vision for Thierry Mugler - she's come full circle. Let it be said, Gaga makes for a pretty sick model. Sometimes even the most captivating show can drag on, and rarely does the audience of editors walk out laughing about the good time they just had. Even the models appeared to be having a blast.

2011-03-03T00:00:00Z,"PARIS -- The regime of the Libyan leader, Col.

They caution that the situation on the ground is both fluid and confusing. But they emphasize that tribal loyalties remain an important indicator, and that there is no clear geographical dividing line between the opponents to Colonel Qaddafi and his supporters."

He has since published at least four novels, a couple of story collections and has collaborated on a monthly comic book. On Wednesday, Scribner, his publisher, announced that in the fall it will bring out yet another King novel, called ''11/23/63.'' The new book is 1,000 pages long - enormous by most standards, but cruising length for Mr. King - and is apparently a ''counterfactual,'' a novel that imagines what would have happened had history turned out differently. It's the story of a Maine high school teacher named Jake Epping who discovers a portal back to 1958 in a storeroom at a local diner. He travels back there and, while enjoying some sex and rock 'n' roll, finds himself with a chance to thwart the assassination of John F. Kennedy."

In fact, it's not surgery, but an in-office procedure that entails having blood drawn from your arm, then spun in a centrifuge to separate the platelets. They are then injected into your face, with the hope of stimulating new collagen production. Selphyl, as the system is called, arrived on the booming facial-rejuvenation market in 2009, and is now used by roughly 300 doctors nationwide in the name of beauty, said Sanjay Batra, the chief executive of Aesthetic Factors, which manufactures the Selphyl system."

2011-03-03T00:00:00Z,"Adele, the British singer who won the best new artist Grammy Award two years ago, is the big winner on the Billboard chart this week, with a No. 1 opening for her new album and a rebound for her last one. Adele's new album, ''21'' (XL/Columbia), opened with 352,000 sales, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Thanks to a blitz of television appearances to promote the album, that was the best opening-week sales of any album in three months. (In the interim, there have been some painfully low numbers.) And her debut album, ''19,'' bolted 34 spots to No. 16, with 18,000 sales. But almost everything else on the chart is a loser. Last week's No. 1, Justin Bieber's ''Never Say Never: The Remixes'' (Island), fell to No. 2 with 102,000, a 38 percent decline, and Mr. Bieber's ''My World 2.0,'' at No. 5, lost 22 percent. Mumford & Sons' ''Sigh No More'' (Glassnote), at No. 3, dropped 46 percent; ''Now That's What I Call Music!'' Vol. 37 is No. 4 with a 38 percent loss; Bruno Mars's ''Doo-Wops & Hooligans'' (Elektra), at No. 6, lost 40 percent, and so on. Last week's numbers were higher than usual because of the traditional retail boost the week after the Grammys. But that only underlines the scale of Adele's success. On the digital singles chart, Lady Gaga's ''Born This Way,'' which was enormously popular out of the gate, lost 44 percent of its sales in its third week, with 286,000, although that was enough for it to hold at No. 1. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
2011-03-03T00:00:00Z,"LONG BEACH, Calif. - Julie Taymor, the director of the new Broadway musical ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,'' said on Wednesday that she was currently ''in the crucible and the fire of transformation'' as she and her collaborators continue to work on improving the show. Addressing a live audience of more than 1,000 people at the TED2011 conference here, and many more through streaming video, Ms. Taymor was humble as she acknowledged the turbulence surrounding the ''Spider-Man'' project, the most expensive in Broadway history (at $65 million and counting) and technically ambitious. And she graciously praised her cast and collaborators for sticking with the show in spite of the intense media spotlight and the steady negative jabs, particularly from theater critics.''Anyone who creates knows - when it's not quite there,'' Ms. Taymor, a Tony Award winner for the blockbuster musical ''The Lion King,'' said. ''Where it hasn't quite become the phoenix or the burnt char. And I am right there.'' The producers of ''Spider-Man,'' along with Ms. Taymor and her co-creators, U2's Bono and the Edge, are now deciding whether to open the musical as scheduled on March 15, or delay the opening for a sixth time to continue making changes to the script, music, direction, and other elements of the show. Bono attended Tuesday night's performance of ''Spider-Man,'' his first viewing since mid-January, to inform his opinion about opening or delaying. Ms. Taymor is to fly back to New York shortly. The production is expected to announce this week that opening night is confirmed for March 15 or will be delayed."

That feat has been accomplished seven times, not three.

In recent years, in fact, the French capital has become home to an unusual number of classic French restaurants run by Japanese chefs, along with a slew of new Franco-Japanese hybrids. And while the food at Michelin-starred, Japanese-run veterans like Hiramatsu (52, rue de Longchamp; 011-33-1-56-81-08-80) and Stella Maris (4, rue Arsene Houssaye; 011-33-1-42-89-16-22) is very classically French, many of the newer arrivals are letting their Japanese heritage come through clearly."

The latter case applies to Gregory Euclide's work which, at a glance, looks like an elegant spill of paint but on closer inspection reveals a carefully executed diorama. Euclide's inspiration is drawn from the land, but that is not to say he paints landscapes. ""I know that I am simply using the landscape to reach something more complicated,"" he says. Two of his pieces - made of a heady blend of plant life (blackberry lily seed, sedum, sagebrush, moss) and other materials (hair, polymer resin, mylar) - are on view this weekend as part of PULSE, the contemporary art fair at the Metropolitan Pavilion. The Milwaukee-born Euclide is anticipating a prosperous year. He is now collaborating with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver on the artwork for the band's forthcoming album and will show more of his work in June at the Museum of Arts & Design ""Otherworldly"" exhibition. ""With these works I often do a painting then crumple it up,"" he says. ""The paper becomes the topography of the land."""

In other words, what if -- instead of fighting for good -- the smartest, toughest, richest man were a champion of evil? ""Nemesis"" was written by Mark Millar, who was also behind ""Kick Ass,"" and illustrated by Steve McNiven.

And more important, when can they buy tickets for the first ''Star Wars'' movie to be released in 3-D? Lucasfilm and 20th Century Fox answered one of those questions on Thursday, announcing that ''Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,'' the first of the six space-adventure films that George Lucas and Industrial Light & Magic are converting for 3-D presentation, will be released in theaters next year on Feb. 10. In a statement, the studios said the 3-D conversion is ''being done with utmost respect for the source material, and with a keen eye for both technological considerations and artistic intentions.'' (We assume that means artists won't overemphasize the adorable chipmunk cheeks of a young Natalie Portman.)

On Wednesday night, Warner Brothers Pictures said Ms. Lane, whose more recent movies include ''The Perfect Storm,'' ''Unfaithful'' and ''Secretariat,'' would play the mother of the film's title character - not the Kryptonian mother of Kal-El, who arrives on earth from a dying alien planet, but Martha Kent, an adoptive parent who raises him in his guise as Clark Kent. Mr. Snyder, the director of previous comic book adaptations like ''Watchmen'' and ''300,'' said: ''This was a very important piece of casting for me, because Martha Kent is the woman whose values helped shape the man we know as Superman. We are thrilled to have Diane in the role, because she can convey the wisdom and the wonder of a woman whose son has powers beyond her imagination.''"

2011-03-04T00:00:00Z,"GOTTSEGEN--Robert, D.D.S.,Professor Emeritus of Dental Medicine of the Columbia University College of Dental Medicine, passed away on March 1, 2011. Dr. Robert Gottsegen was born on June 21, 1919, the son of a dentist. He and his wife Rita (Gillette) Gottsegen had three sons, David, Daniel, and Jonathan. Bob graduated from the University of Michigan in 1939, where his skill as a caricaturist made him the sports cartoonist for the college newspaper. He entered Columbia's School of Dental and Oral Surgery (now the College of Dental Medicine) in 1940 and was in one of the classes that had an accelerated program due to the war, graduating in 1943. After an internship at Mt. Sinai Hospital, he spent two years in the Army and then an additional two years as a Public Health Service/NIH Research Fellow in Dentistry. In 1947, he entered the first class in what was then known as the Advanced Specialty Training Program in Periodontics, also known as the ""Certificate"" program. He graduated in 1948 and started a private practice limited to periodontics in New York City. Dr. Gottsegen became active in both academic dentistry and organized dentistry almost immediately, holding offices in the American Society of Periodontists, the Executive Council of the American Academy of Periodontology, as Consultant to the National Commission on Diabetes, and as Director and later Co-Chairman of the American Board of Periodontology. He rose through the academic ranks, first to Associate Professor at Columbia, then moving to the University of Pennsylvania, where he was Postgraduate Periodontics Director, and then back to Columbia in 1969 as Professor of Dentistry, Director of the Division of Periodontics, and head of the Postgraduate Program in Periodontics. He held those titles until his retirement in 1988. Dr. Gottsegen rose to become President of the American Academy of Periodontology (1970-71), receiving the Gold Medal Award of the Academy in 1988. He received numerous other awards, including Fellow of the American Academy of Periodontology, Distinguished Alumnus Award of Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery, and the Isadore Hirschfeld Award of the Northeastern Society of Periodontists. He was a member of honor societies Omicron Kappa Upsilon and Sigma Xi, Fellow of the American College of Dentists, and Fellow of the New York Academy of Dentistry. He always maintained an interest in research and published on a wide variety of topics, including the relationship of diabetes to periodontal disease and periodontal diagnosis and therapy. In 2006, he was the first recipient of the College of Dental Medicine Lifetime Achievement Award. Above all, Dr. Gottsegen was an educator. His lectures were remarkably well organized and coherent, his clinical demonstrations flawless, his questions of students designed to bring out the best in those he taught, and his knowledge of the relevant literature encyclopedic. He was often in demand as a lecturer, presenting continuing education courses to many local dental societies, dental schools, and regional dental meetings throughout the United States. Bob will be remembered for his prodigious intellect, sharp wit, and his devotion to Columbia. We extend our deepest condolences to his three sons and to members of his family. The memorial service for Dr. Gottsegen will be held on Sunday, March 6, at 2:30p.m., as follows: Zion Memorial Chapel, 785 East Boston Post Road, Mamaroneck, NY 10543; 914-381-1809 www.zionmemorialchapel. com.

2011-03-04T00:00:00Z,"The Parisian street artist known as JR -- a peripatetic figure who has made a name for himself by plastering urban areas around the world with huge photographs of the downtrodden residents who live there (above, works of his in Clichy-sous-Bois, outside Paris) -- became the unlikely winner several months ago of the 2011 TED Prize (the name stands for Technology, Entertainment, Design). The philanthropic honor gives the winner (past recipients have included Bono and Bill Clinton) the chance to make a grand wish. On Wednesday at the TED organization's annual conference in Long Beach, Calif., the artist revealed his wish -- which the group's backers will help finance. And the wish, perhaps not surprisingly, is to try to turn the entire world into a socially conscious graffiti collective. The artist has started a project called Inside Out that allows people to upload a photo of themselves (or of families or groups of people) free to a Web site, insideoutproject.net. JR and a team of aides then make those photographs into large posters that are mailed back to the senders of the photographs, with the hope that that they will display the posters in public. Whether the posters are displayed with the permission of property owners or are pasted up in a more guerrilla fashion seems to be up the poster owners. ''Posters can be placed anywhere, from a solitary image in an office window to a wall of portraits on an abandoned building or a full stadium,'' says the project's Web site, which already reported 500 uploaded photographs by 6 p.m. Wednesday, just after the project was announced. The goal, JR says, is to transform ''messages of personal identity into pieces of artistic work.'' RANDY KENNEDY"

2011-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LIBYA: As rebels in the oil town of Brega celebrated a victory over forces loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, two working-class neighborhoods in Tripoli that were in open revolt just a week ago were silent and fearful after a clampdown by militiamen and the disappearances of several people who were involved in the protests. That climate of fear suggests just how effectively Colonel Qaddafi's harsh methods to crush dissent in Tripoli, the capital, have sealed off that city. EGYPT: Egypt's ruling military council forced the resignation of Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq on Thursday, which had long been a goal of the protest movement. Borrowing a tactic from the movement, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces announced the resignation on Facebook. The generals were evidently trying to head off another huge demonstration on Friday in Tahrir Square by naming a new prime minister, Essam A. Sharaf, who was endorsed by the protesters a day before. Mr. Shafiq seemed to have sealed his fate during a televised confrontation with opponents on Wednesday night when he said that the secret police could be renamed rather than disbanded. Yet even as celebrations ensued, there was a painful awareness that enormous questions remained unanswered for the country. Also on Thursday, Zahi Hawass, Egypt's chief antiquities official for almost a decade and since January a cabinet minister, said that he would not stay on in a newly formed government. On his blog, he posted a list of about two dozen sites that have been looted or vandalized since the uprising."

It was nearly 8 a.m., the streets were quiet, and as the taxi approached the cafe, I noticed that the metal grilles of the buildings next to Brasserie Lipp shimmered pale pink; and when I looked further down the boulevard, there was a chalky haze. I wondered where the sun was. Then, suddenly, it was there, enormous, rising above the church next to the Cafe Deux Magots."

There were also capes and loose-back jackets, all in matte black leather that didn't look rigid and wasn't embellished. Another way he kept things contemporary was to put the molded jackets with A-line or softly gathered wool skirts that didn't enhance your rear in a regrettable way.

For one thing, the Republican-crafted House bill also dismantles a second expanded 1099 reporting requirement directed at landlords that was part of the small-business jobs act. But the crucial difference, as Robert reports, is over how to pay for the repeal.

(HBO) ROBIN HOOD (2010) The director Ridley Scott and the actor Russell Crowe, above, -- collaborators on ''Gladiator,'' ''A Good Year,'' ''American Gangster'' and ''Body of Lies'' -- team up once again in what A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called a ''long, bloody, self-serious new version of the legend.'' This Robin is not a ''Hood'' but rather Longstride, an archer in the army of King Richard the Lionheart, on his way home from the Crusades. ''You may have heard that Robin Hood stole from the rich and gave to the poor, but that was just liberal media propaganda,'' A. O. Scott said. ''This Robin is no socialist bandit practicing freelance wealth redistribution, but rather a manly libertarian rebel striking out against high taxes and a big government scheme to trample the ancient liberties of property owners and provincial nobles. Don't tread on him!'' Cate Blanchett plays Marion; Eileen Atkins is Eleanor of Aquitaine; and Matthew Macfadyen is the sheriff. The Times review added that, in true Ridley Scott form, there are enough large-scale action sequences ''to keep you alert and fitfully engaged.'' 8 P.M. (TCM) ON THE CHAIN GANG Five films depict life in shackles, starting with ''Cool Hand Luke'' (1967), starring Paul Newman as a war hero sentenced to jail after cutting the tops off parking meters. Mr. Newman earned an Academy Award nomination for his turn as a prisoner who refuses to break under a brutal system. George Kennedy won the Oscar for best supporting actor for his role as Dragline, the gang's top dog. The evening continues with ''The Defiant Ones'' (1958), at 10:15, with Sidney Poitier as an uneducated convict who goes on the lam with his ''other half,'' a white Southern bigot portrayed by Tony Curtis; ''I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang'' (1932), at midnight, in which Paul Muni plays a World War I veteran and drifter sentenced to 10 years of hard labor for a crime he did not commit; ''Hell's Highway'' (1932), at 1:45 a.m., about a convict (Richard Dix) who learns that his younger brother (Tom Brown) will be joining him behind bars; ''Chain Gang'' (1950), at 3, with Douglas Kennedy as a reporter who gets a job as a prison guard to document inhuman conditions; and ''Deep Valley'' (1947), at 4:15, starring Ida Lupino as an abused farm girl who takes in an escaped convict."

Mr. Dylan, who has previously performed in Hong Kong, is to play at the Workers' Gymnasium in Beijing on April 6 and the Shanghai Grand Stage on April 8, according to Gehua Live Nation, the Beijing organizers of these concerts.

Tickets for Mr. Dylan's Chinese concerts will cost between 280 yuan (about $42) and 1,961.411 yuan (about $300), an amount chosen to commemorate the April 11, 1961, date of his breakthrough show in New York, when he opened for John Lee Hooker at Gerde's Folk City in Greenwich Village.

2011-03-05T00:00:00Z,"GOTTSEGEN--Dr. Robert, born in New York on June 21, 1919, was a pioneer in the field of Periodontal Dentistry. An alumnus of Townsend Harris High School, Dr. Gottsegen graduated from the University of Michigan in 1939. Exhibiting his lifelong passion for art, he was the sports cartoonist for the college newspaper, and also studied set design. He entered the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery (now the College of Dental Medicine) in 1940 in a program accelerated due to the War. He graduated in 1943. After an internship at Mt. Sinai Hospital, he served in the U.S. Army, where he earned a U.S. Army Commendation Medal, European Theatre of Operations. He then spent an additional two years as a Public Health Service/ N.I.H. Research Fellow in Dentistry. In 1947 he entered the first class in what was then known as the Advanced Specialty Training Program in Periodontics, also known as the ""Certified"" program. Graduating in 1948, he started a private practice limited to Periodontics in New York City. Dr. Gottsegen became active in academics and organized dentistry almost immediately, holding offices in the American Society of Periodontists, the Executive Council of the American Academy of Periodontology, and serving as Consultant to the National Commission on Diabetes and as Director and later Co-Chairman of the American Board of Periodontology. He earned the rank of Associate Professor at Columbia University, then moved to the University of Pennsylvania as Postgraduate Periodontics Director before returning to Columbia to serve as Director of Postgraduate Periodontics. Dr. Gottsegen rose to the presidency of the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) from 1970-71, receiving the Gold Medal Award of the Academy in 1988. He received numerous other awards, including, Fellow of the AAP, Distinguished Alumnus Award of Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery, and the Isadore Hirschfeld Award of the Northeastern Society of Periodontists. He was a Fellow of the American College of Dentists and Fellow of the New York Academy of Dentistry. He was always interested in research, including diabetes as it relates to periodontal disease, systems of health care delivery and metabolic influences on periodontal disease. Above all, Dr. Gottsegen was a teacher and mentor to hundreds of students. His clinical demonstrations were works of dental art, and his knowledge of the relevant literature was encyclopedic. He was often in demand as a lecturer at other schools and in many foreign countries, presenting more than 650 courses over 38 years. Dr. Gottsegen was a connoisseur of fine wines and dining. He had lifelong passion for travel, visual arts, music and theatre. Most of all he loved spending time with his six beloved grandchildren, Jessica, Liza, Sam, Ben, Kate, and Gardner. Dr. Gottsegen was predeceased by his wife of 54 years, Rita Gillette. He is survived by his sons David (wife Shelly), Daniel, and Jonathan (wife Mindy), and his practice partner and devoted friend Dr. Susan Karabin. A Memorial Service in his honor will be held at Zion Memorial Chapel of Westchester, 767 East Boston Post Road, Mamaroneck, NY (914) 381-1809, on Sunday, March 6 at 2:30pm. Contributions may be made in his honor to the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery or the American Academy of Periondontics."

2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"''A book itself threatens to kill its author repeatedly during its composition,'' Michael Chabon writes in the margins of his unfinished novel ''Fountain City'' -- a novel, he adds, that he could feel ''erasing me, breaking me down, burying me alive, drowning me, kicking me down the stairs.'' And so Chabon fought back: he killed ''Fountain City'' in 1992. What was to be the follow-up to his first novel, ''The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,'' instead was a black mark on his hard drive, five and a half years of work wasted. That's why you've never read ''Fountain City,'' just as you've never read John Updike's ''Willow,'' Junot Díaz's ''Dark America'' or Jennifer Egan's ''Inland Souls'' -- all abandoned by their authors after years of toil and piles of pages. Chabon, though, has recently published the first four chapters of ''Fountain City'' in the literary magazine McSweeney's, complete with annotations that in turn bemoan and belittle the book that stole so much of his life before he put his misery out of its misery."

2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"Vallejo, a city about 25 miles north of San Francisco, offers a sneak preview of what could be the latest version of economic disaster. When the foreclosure wave hit, local tax revenue evaporated. The city managers couldn't make their budget and eliminated financing for the local museum, the symphony and the senior center. The city begged the public-employee unions for pay cuts -- all to no avail. In May 2008, Vallejo filed for bankruptcy. The filing drew little national attention; most people were too busy watching banks fail to worry about cities. But while the banks have largely recovered, Vallejo is still in bankruptcy. The police force has shrunk from 153 officers to 92. Calls for any but the most serious crimes go unanswered. Residents who complain about prostitutes or vandals are told to fill out a form. Three of the city's firehouses were closed. Last summer, a fire ravaged a house in one of the city's better neighborhoods; one of the firetrucks came from another town, 15 miles away. Is this America's future? Cities across America are facing dire financial distress. Meredith Whitney, a banking analyst turned independent adviser who correctly predicted the banking meltdown, has issued an Armageddon-like prediction of mass municipal defaults. Others -- notably Newt Gingrich -- have suggested that state governments as well as cities should be allowed to file for bankruptcy. Congress held a hearing to examine the idea."

The same day, HBO first broadcast the play ''Thurgood'' starring Laurence Fishburne. Both featured a conversation in which President Johnson called Judge Marshall of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and asked him to become solicitor general of the United States. Art was the more vivid. The play turns the exchange into a two-day affair, with the judge asking for time to think it over because he would be giving up life tenure, the president saying he should take as much time as he needs -- and calling back the next morning. ''Mr. President, I thought you said I'd have time.'' ''You had time.''"

2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"THE clamor over ''last in, first out'' -- shorthand for the way union contracts provide for the layoffs of public-school teachers, according to seniority -- is anything but an esoteric political debate for the young teachers at the Academy for Language and Technology, a small high school that opened in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx in 2007. According to a list released by the city, the school stands to lose as many as 9 of 29 teachers if the predictions of 4,675 layoffs before the next school year come true. Many newer schools and those in poor neighborhoods, which tend to hire newer teachers, would lose a particularly large share of their staff members.

In a clear sign that Vieques is no longer off the radar, the first W Retreat and Spa in North America opened its doors there last March.

At first he didn't recognize it and then he couldn't believe it, because for years -- decades, really -- he maintained what was, in his immodest estimation, perfect health. But now there was this undeniable imperfection, a scratchiness and swollenness familiar only from the distant past. Incredibly, infuriatingly, he had a sore throat. ''I never have anything go wrong,'' he said later. ''Never have a backache. Never have a headache. Never have anything else.'' This would make him a lucky man no matter his age. Because he is 87, it makes him an unusually robust specimen, which is what he must be if he is to defy the odds (and maybe even the gods) and live as long as he intends to. He wants to reach 125, and sees no reason he can't, provided that he continues eating the way he has for the last quarter century: with a methodical, messianic correctness that he believes can, and will, ward off major disease and minor ailment alike."

2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"THE inferno that killed 146 people at the Triangle Waist Company 100 years ago occurred on March 25, but because 102 of the victims were Jewish, a date that is as significant is the 25th of Adar in the Hebrew calendar. That anniversary -- their yahrzeit -- occurred Tuesday. So on a sunny if bitingly cold morning, 50 people trooped across a muddy cemetery on Staten Island run by the Hebrew Free Burial Association to say kaddish over the graves of 22 of the fire's victims -- 4 men and 18 women -- who are buried on a hillside, most of them sewing-machine operators whose families had been too poor to afford grave sites and headstones."
2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"BARTLETT, N.H. -- As Mitt Romney travels the country lining up contributors and influential Republicans for a second presidential bid, he is presenting himself as a ready-to-lead executive, gambling that a fluency in economic matters distinguishes him from other candidates and can help overcome concerns about authenticity that dogged his first race. Mr. Romney makes the case, in private meetings with business owners and in appearances like a dinner speech here Saturday, that the halting economic recovery -- even after solid job growth in February, the unemployment rate remains at 8.9 percent -- provides a compelling rationale that he is the strongest candidate to create jobs and take on President Obama."
2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"An obituary last Sunday about Andy Jurinko, an artist known for his baseball paintings, misstated the score of a 1950 game between the Boston Red Sox and the St. Louis Browns that figured in one of his paintings. The Red Sox won that game 29-4, not 24-9. The obituary also referred incorrectly to the professional background of Marty Appel, who discussed the significance of Mr. Jurinko's work. While he did work for the Yankees for 25 years and was eventually chief publicist, he did not hold that position during his entire tenure. (He began as a publicist and later produced their games for television.)"

A new and disturbing video posted on YouTube that has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times shows a group of Afghan or Pakistani Pashtun boys role-playing the last moments in the life of a suicide bomber. Whether it is meant as a rehearsal or as a form of propaganda for the Taliban is impossible to say, but the message is clear: This is something to aspire to."
2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"WHEN it comes to Chris Rock, it's the gait above all. Sure, there's the voice too, a purring rasp that never sounds at peace, and the eyes, which are emphatic and precise. But anyone who's seen Mr. Rock walk the stage during one of his comedy shows knows his stride cold: the long, slightly jagged steps that seem to eat up the floor beneath him; the mild bop in his strut; the liquidity of his movement, as if he's engaged in one very long motion, not hundreds of small ones. So it's noticeable when Mr. Rock, 46, walks into the Harlem restaurant Sylvia's with small, quiet steps, as he did last month. A goatee shot out at an angle from his chin, and his head, from which no shortage of outlandish, blue insults have issued over the years, was tucked into a soft hat. This is Mr. Rock in repose."

2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"Lykke Li This Swedish indie-pop warbler has often done a lot with a little -- consider the suggestive wisps of melody all over ''Youth Novels'' (LL/Atlantic), her 2008 debut -- but she's no minimalist, at least not anymore. ''Wounded Rhymes,'' her follow-up on the same label, has thumping drums, Farfisa organs, girl-group vocal harmonies and darkly pealing guitars. It also has songs of desolate stoicism and disconsolate fury. Lykke Li wrote most of them alone in Los Angeles, on the mend from a broken relationship, and she put a lot of hurt into her lyrics. ''All my love is unrequited,'' she wails in one Phil Spector-ish set piece. ''Sadness is my boyfriend,'' she declares in another. But there's steel in her delivery. When she spits out the phrase ''I'm your prostitute,'' on ''Get Some,'' she's asserting control over her own exploitation. Speaking of which, this album has already yielded a cottage industry of remixes, including an especially brooding entry from Tyler the Creator, chief provocateur of the rap group Odd Future. Wringing a stream of watery invective out of ''I Follow Rivers,'' he could well be standing in for the guy who caused all this heartache in the first place."

He was once a young prospect who never lived up to expectations but who made his way around the major leagues -- from the Dodgers to the Mets and teams beyond -- and wound up figuring in some memorable moments in baseball history.

2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"CAIRO -- When the prime minister of Egypt stepped down on Thursday, Shereen Diaa, 32, was cooking lunch for her two young sons in a suburb on Cairo's outskirts. A veiled woman who molds her life around her children, Ms. Diaa had promised herself she would stop attending political protests and focus on her boys, ages 6 and 8. But when she saw on Facebook that the new prime minister himself would address the protesters the next day, in an unprecedented act, she could not resist. ''I will leave you only two hours,'' she said she told the children, dropping them off with her mother and then heading downtown to Tahrir Square."
2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"CRAIG--John S. Noted Photo-journalist, Photo-historian and Daguerreian Author John Scott Craig died of cancer peacefully at home Friday February 25, 2011. He is survived by his beloved wife, the Hon. Joyce Krutick Craig (Retired), and devoted children, Samuel Walker Craig of Hawaii, step-son Ian Barlow and wife Heather Tasker Barlow of Washington DC, and doting granddaughter, Harper Isabel Barlow. His daughter, Sarah Theresa Craig predeceased him in 1996. Born October 23, 1943 in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania to the late John S. Craig, II and Frances Craig (nee Gallagher), Craig graduated from the Shadyside Academy and went on to receive his BA from Wesleyan University in 1965. His interest in antique photography began about 1969; fueled from working as a photographer/reporter at the Hartford Courant while in college. After graduation, Craig spent another six years with The Courant, as well as owning his own retail camera store in Simsbury, and serving as a photographer with the Connecticut Army National Guard. One of the first ""professional"" full-time dealers in photographica in this country, Craig published a catalog in 1970 and inadvertently became a photographic historian. Craig was the Founding President of the New England Photographic Historical Society. He was active before SHUTTERBUG magazine's publication, and then wrote a column for them, opining about the various collector's shows around the country. Highlights of Craig's career came in three interviews and photo sessions with the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and a 1960s/1970s interview with the hugely controversial figure, Timothy Leary. During the August 1967 racial violence that erupted in New Haven, CT, Craig was deployed to cover the unrest with a camera. Craig's logo of the early photographer standing behind his camera, with the dark cloth over his head, was registered as his world-wide trademark in 1973. For years he has attended collector's shows from coast to coast; been the subject of mention in Popular Photography, The Rangefinder, Camera and Darkroom, and numerous other publications. As a photographic dealer, he carried more than 155,000 instruction booklets for thousands of cameras, accessories and projectors; and nearly 10,000 other interesting photography items. As early as 1971, Craig published reprints of early photographic catalogs, usable and classic camera instruction booklets, and worthwhile camera repair manuals. The distinguished Craig's Daguerreian Registry, the acknowledged reference work among dealers and collector's for identifying and dating the more than 12,000 photographers, who worked in the United States prior to 1860, was published in 1994 with two subsequent editions. Craig attended many collector's shows and flea markets since the early 1970's. Professionally, he was a faithful attendee and dealer at the annual Daguerreian Society Symposiums, most recently in Atlanta. In 2007, the Daguerreian Society awarded Craig its first Fellowship Award, inscribed with these words: For the advancement of scholarship in the field of photo history and the willingness to share that knowledge with his contemporaries and future generation of historians, scholars and collectors. A celebration of Craig's life will be held at his home in the early summer. His wife, Joyce Krutick Craig, is in charge of services. Donations in his memory may be made either to the Daguerreian Society, P.O. Box 306, Cecil, PA 15321-0306, or to the Lymphoma Research Foundation, 115 Broadway, Suite 1301, New York, NY 10006."

So he brought up the hottest topic he could think of: bicycle lanes, and the transportation commissioner who had nearly doubled the number of them, Janette Sadik-Khan.

The money, for medical equipment, training and logistical support, would help improve health care for Egyptian soldiers. Within a few years, though, an American training team realized that the Egyptian military was benefiting in a different way. The medical center was, as one Pentagon official called it, ''a commercial enterprise,'' and many of its patients were civilians, not Egyptian soldiers. The hospital was even venturing into medical tourism; its Web site promotes ''a lavishly furnished Royal Suite'' for international patients."

Or, in this case, three (Jimmi Simpson, Malcolm Goodwin and Serinda Swan), who receive upgraded accommodations and time shaved off their sentences in exchange for their efforts. ''Law & Order'' it's not. ''Matt and I really wanted to do a show where the heroes weren't earnest,'' Mr. Santora said, about the series's humor and verbal sparring, in an interview in The New York Times.

Twice democracy was overthrown: from the inside in 411 B.C. and by the Spartans in 404. The Spartans resembled the Nazis as much as any Greeks did in that period (and as with Vichy France, the Spartans had their Athenian sympathizers). The Thirty Tyrants, whom the Spartans installed to crush democracy, were the bloodiest rulers in Athenian history. The Thirty included Plato's upper-class circle of family and friends, several of whom had hobnobbed with Socrates, though he sought to dissociate himself from some of their brutality. The democrats overthrew the Thirty in 403; to prevent a bloodbath of recriminations, they passed an amnesty law regarding crimes committed during that time."

2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"BLOOD SIMPLE: By day, Deborah Harkness is a highly regarded historian of 17th-century science and proprietor of the award-winning blog Good Wine Under $20. By night, she's a crazed vampire compiling tasting notes on the blood of graduate students -- or so her first novel, ''A Discovery of Witches,'' might lead you to believe. The story of an American academic who finds a magic book (and some Château d'Yquem-soaked hot paranormal romance) in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, ''Discovery'' notches its second week at No. 2 on the hardcover fiction list. That's an impressive showing for a writer whose previous book, ''The Jewel House: Elizabethan London and the Scientific Revolution,'' had an initial print run in the mid-four figures. But then Harkness, who teaches at the University of Southern California, isn't the first academic to score with a heavily promoted mash-up of Stephenie Meyer's ''Twilight'' and A. S. Byatt's ''Possession.'' Back in 2009, Katherine Howe, a Ph.D. candidate in American and New England studies at Boston University, had a five-week run on the hardcover list with ''The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane,'' a historical mystery about a Harvard graduate student who discovers a mysterious key tucked in a musty family Bible and gets drawn into the story of an ancestor accused in the Salem witch trials. Diana Bishop, the heroine of Harkness's book, is also a direct descendant of an accused Salem witch -- though it should be noted that in contrast with Howe's protagonist, she hails from New Haven. Anyone taking bets on the outcome of a paranormal Harvard-Yale game? And which side would Daniel Drezner, the Tufts professor behind the recent study ''Theories of International Politics and Zombies,'' be on? Published in January by Princeton University Press, the book offers no clues, but Drezner does have this to say about a former Princeton wrestler who is still hanging around near the top of this week's hardcover nonfiction list: ''Zombies have been an obvious metaphor for medical maladies, mob rule and Marxist dialectics. Some international relations scholars would posit that interest in zombies is an indirect attempt to get a cognitive grip on what former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously referred to as the 'unknown unknowns' in international security.''"

Marvin was born July 22, 1926 in Bronx, NY. He was a graduate of Townsend Harris in January 1942; City College (where he was accepted and enrolled at age 15), receiving a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering from the School of Technology; and Columbia University, where he earned a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1949. Interrupting his education, he enlisted and served in the United States Navy during World War II. He was selected for a unit that specialized in the then-emerging field of radar technology and electronics. Marvin was the longtime President of International Casein Corp. Early in his professional career he worked at Emerson Radio, and then in research and development at Sperry Gyroscope Co., a division of Sperry Rand Corp., where he was involved in the development of automatic pilot technology used in aviation. A passionate skier and tennis player throughout his life, he actively pursued skiing and tennis into his early 80s. In addition to sports, he enjoyed playing bridge. Ever curious, he was an enthusiastic world traveler--especially fond of the Savoie region of France--who spoke fluent French and Spanish. A brilliant mind and a kind spirit, creative and inventive, a devoted husband of 50 years and a loving father, as well as a mentor to many, Marvin loved life completely and lived it intensely.

2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"ARTISTIC revolutions rarely happen overnight, and if they do happen quickly, they do not necessarily spread uniformly. In recent decades the early-music movement has provoked a radical shift in performance styles throughout much of the music world. As an eccentric, irrelevant outsider in cultural life, the movement has managed to transform attitudes toward tradition and has wrought major changes in orchestral practice. A movement that started in powerful opposition to modern conventions has become increasingly integrated with mainstream performance. But New York, an early leader in the movement through the medieval and Renaissance explorations of Noah Greenberg and the New York Pro Musica Antiqua in the 1950s and '60s, more recently lagged behind in crucial ways. Now, during the coming weeks, in a sort of serendipitous festival, the city plays host to some of today's outstanding early-music ensembles and conductors and puts forward a leading period-instrument ensemble of its own being nurtured at the Juilliard School, Juilliard415."

2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"Joshua Foer is right. In ancient times, memorization was a key skill vital to preserving knowledge. And it wasn't only the ancient Greeks who used their memories in such a fashion. There are still vestiges of the vast bodies of knowledge that must have been common place in preliterate cultures. There are still a handful of Pacific Islanders who can navigate based on the precise position and distance of the stars above the horizon and on their knowledge of tides and currents. In many Muslim countries, it is commonplace for children no older than 10 or 12 to have memorized the entire Koran. Such feats of memorization are also common among Orthodox religious students and among Hindus who memorize chanted prayers and scriptures. Religion was once the major institution for passing on vital cultural knowledge. We are no longer lonely bands of hunter-gather warriors, so this vast amount of informationis no longer necessary. But the capacity is there, in all of us. RUANNE Arkansas, Feb. 19, 2011, 9:56 a.m., nytimes.com Frances Yates's famous and influential book, ''The Art of Memory'' (1966), describes the building of a memory house. Excited by Yates's unfolding of the technique, I used it myself quite fervently for a few months around 1967, when I was a professor at the University of Washington. I was amazed at the result. The memory house (as I called it) worked like a charm. Unfortunately, it is still very much present in my mind, its various rooms still containing student names, weird artifacts and words from arbitrary lists."

Corn was so central to the existence of Native Americans that they considered it sacred. The Iroquois tribes of the Northeast personified it as one of the Three Sisters -- the other two were beans and squash -- and planted them together to sustain both life and spirit. But they could also hunt, forage and fish for other food. In the Southwestern desert, without such rich options, the Hopi, Zuni and Navajo looked to the Corn Maiden, symbol of corn and life, to keep them from starvation."

The show, which the group will perform at Zankel Hall on Thursday evening, is a tightly scripted, continuously morphing collage of music, dialogue and visual images that explores the compositional and political currents that swirled in the late 1960s and continue to resonate. Yet its conceptual starting point was a vague report, noted in Michael Kurtz's biography of the iconoclastic German avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, that Stockhausen had arranged to meet with one of the Beatles at the composer Lukas Foss's New York apartment on Feb. 9, 1969, to discuss a joint concert.

There have been persistent reports of big cat sightings in the East, but scientists say these were other subspecies that had been held in captivity and had escaped or had been released to the wild. They could also have been wild cougars of the Western United States subspecies that had migrated East to the Midwest. More of these cougars may find their way to the East from their strongholds in the West, where numbers have been growing.

Bluntly, the novella is in its Golden Age as a form right now because no one is beating it with a stick until nickels fall out. So my plan for the novella is -- drum roll: Do nothing. Or do whatever little is required to steward the status quo. Let's agree, shall we, to keep throwing around the inane term Great American Novel, and to never, ever utter the phrase Great American Novella. Let's agree not to remind California what it used to take for granted, that novellas, because of their length, can often be more handily adapted than novels into movies. Let us not remind New York what all the avid and demanding among us take for granted, that a volume of three novellas is more intriguing than one flabby novel. Let us downplay the novella in casual conversation. Writers, if you have a can't-miss commercially viable yarn a-brewing, be good enough to stretch it into a short novel or compress it into a long story. And look, let's keep the novella for ourselves, the adults. We deserve something, don't we? Let's free the novella of prizes and awards and citations and all manner of gold star. Let's fail to educate our students about the novella, fail to convince them of its charms. That way, we need never be nostalgic for the Golden Age of the novella.

Not only are we having a 1960s revival, but also the industry seems to be waking up with a crushing hangover or a severe case of doubts, and, well, people don't like the feeling. The book is actually a catalog of images -- and splendid they are -- from the archives of the Fondation Pierre Bergé-Yves Saint Laurent, where an exhibition about Rive Gauche and its first boutique will open on Saturday at the foundation's headquarters. (It runs through July 17.) The ''Beatle of Rue Spontini'' and Mr. Bergé, his business partner, opened the boutique on Sept. 26, 1966, at 21 rue de Tournon. Saint Laurent was a couturier, and he was going to offer fashion at roughly a 10th of the price of his haute couture. In a photograph taken around the time of the opening, Saint Laurent is seen making a mock adjustment to the bow tie of his friend Catherine Deneuve's tuxedo. The picture, made in front of a Niki de Saint Phalle sculpture, confirms how much of the YSL code was already in place: the modern but unfussy interior, the agitating squares of deep pink and bright orange and, of course, the forward-slanting logo by Cassandre."

But Wisconsin's beleaguered labor movement woke up and mobilized, through e-mail blasts, phone trees and Facebook, getting tens of thousands of supporters to rally in Madison against the legislation and surprising itself that it could muster such a show of force so quickly. For now, the two sides are at a stalemate, with protesters still swarming the Capitol and Democratic senators hiding in Illinois to deny the Republican majority the quorum needed to pass Mr. Walker's bill. Meanwhile, governors in other states, most notably New Jersey and Ohio, have gone on the offensive against labor, deriding teachers' unions, tenure and generous pensions."

A tailback for American Heritage in Plantation, Fla., Michel has rushed for 39 touchdowns and nearly 3,500 yards in two varsity seasons.

2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"As a reporter, I covered two of the greatest losers of the last century. The superlative ''greatest'' applies both to the scale of the loss -- Mikhail Gorbachev lost Russia and all of its colonies, F. W. de Klerk lost the richest country in Africa -- and to the manner in which they lost it. Our hearts understandably thrill to the courage of those who stand up to power -- from Tiananmen Square to Tahrir Square and all the streets that now teem with the young and freedom-hungry. But there is another heroism, scarce and undervalued, that accrues to those who know how to stand down."

What with despots, Charlie Sheen and rail riders who feel that quiet-car restrictions apply to everyone but them, it seems we already have plenty to go around. And yet advocating for more wickedness is exactly what I am forced to do after watching Season 1 of ''Dennis the Menace,'' which is being released this month on DVD by Shout! Factory. Dennis, who arrived on television screens on Oct. 4, 1959, and stayed for 146 episodes over four seasons, was evil incarnate, and he worked hard at it. He wasn't bad just once an episode so that he could receive some tidy life lesson in the final five minutes. He crammed as much wrongdoing into a half-hour as Lindsay Lohan manages in a year. Watching him in action, all I could think was: ''This kid is way more entertaining than the small fry on TV today. Nothing around in the last few decades but cutesy quip spewers like the Olsen twins. What the heck happened?'' The television ''Dennis the Menace,'' of course, was based on the comic strip by Hank Ketcham, and young Jay North, who had just turned 8 when the show had its premiere, memorably brought the character to life. Mischief making, it turns out, is something that needs to be heard and felt, not just sketched. Forget the comics-art purists; this was a television adaptation that ended up being far spunkier than its print-medium inspiration."

She is survived by her five children Gene, Jeffrey, Deborah, Beth and Laura; their spouses Travis, Gail, Steve and Reuf; her grandchildren Jessica, Sara, Melissa, Alyson, Jay, Ashley, Carey, Ben and Margo; and her great-grandchildren Jacqueline, Jody and Jamison. Dr. Marchi was a fourth generation San Franciscan whose great-grandmother crossed the plains in a covered wagon from New York City. She was an Alumna of Lowell High School, Stanford University and UC Berkeley. ""To Rest is to Rust"" is the title of her upcoming memoirs as Founder and CEO of National Association for Visually Handicapped (NAVH). In 1948, Dr. Marchi discovered the need to address the gap of services for people who were not classified as blind but did not have normal vision. For over 55 years, Dr. Marchi tirelessly dedicated herself to ensure that a wide variety of services would be available to clients with low vision, whom she trademarked ""Hard of Seeing."" Her mission in life was to help the ""Hard of Seeing"" overcome their challenges of vision impairment through educational materials, support groups, and counseling individuals, their family members and doctors. Through the support services offered, the clients would share their renewed hope and ability to continue their lives with dignity and independence. Recognized by 3M as an award-winning master printer, she used her acquired expertise to educate major publishers on the standards required to meet the needs of the ""Hard of Seeing."" In many large-print books printed today, publishers proudly display the NAVH Seal of Approval. Dr. Marchi has been the recipient of numerous awards and honors. In 1957 she was awarded the San Francisco Examiner's Phoebe Hearst Award. In 2006 she received the Special Recognition Award from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, whom she joined as an exhibitor displaying NAVH material and educating members for over 50 years. She is also the recipient of the 2009 Jefferson Award. Over the years she has received many personal congratulatory letters from distinguished politicians including many Presidents of the United States from Lyndon Johnson to Barack Obama, Mayors of San Francisco and New York, along with various United States and State Senators. In 2010, Lighthouse International, located in New York City, acquired NAVH and expanded their social services program with the addition of the Dr. Lorraine Marchi/NAVH Client Assistance Program. On January 11, 2011, Dr. Marchi made her final public appearance at a Lighthouse International event honoring her and dedicating the opening of the new program to her legacy. A private celebration of Dr. Marchi's life will be held in the spring. In lieu of flowers, memorials can be made to: Dr. Lorraine Marchi/NAVH Client Assistance Program, c/o Lighthouse International, 111 East 59th Street, New York, NY 10022"

When she was a high-school student in Manhattan in the mid-1980s, she walked home at night from her job at Pasta & Cheese, on the Upper East Side, to the apartment where she grew up, on East 25th Street. When she began her prison sentence in Peru, in 1996, for collaborating with a terrorist group, convicted terrorists had to spend 231/2 hours a day inside their cells. Even then, Berenson walked in the 6-by-9-foot space she and another woman shared -- two steps forward, two steps backward -- for hours. ''People ask, what did you miss most?'' she said in August, two and a half months after she was released on parole, having served nearly 15 years of a 20-year sentence. ''This was definitely it.'' It was after dark, and we were taking a rapid, circuitous walk through a park that clutches the crumbly cliff tops in the Miraflores district of Lima, where Berenson and her 15-month-old son, Salvador, had been living since her release. (Berenson's parole requires that she remain in Peru until 2015.) They were sharing an apartment with a family friend and, temporarily, Berenson's parents, who were visiting from New York. Berenson had recently separated from her husband -- Salvador's father -- whom she'd met in prison while he, too, was serving a sentence for terrorism. Soon after his release in 2003, they married, and Salvador was conceived during a conjugal visit. The boy spent his first year of life with Berenson in the women's prison in Chorrillos, Lima."

2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"THE designer Dror Benshetrit of Studio Dror recently unveiled QuaDror, a space truss geometry that he invented and patented. Its interlocking load-bearing members function at several scales, from the small (a table base or room divider) to the large (a bridge support or structure for a house). But the application about which Mr. Benshetrit is most excited is emergency housing. The QuaDror Home is a kit that includes instructions, tools and QuaDror universal joints -- to which structural members (of wood, bamboo, etc.) can be attached. Because they take up so little room, about 1,750 of the kits can be shipped in a single 40-foot container. Small, sturdy houses can be built with whatever local materials are available, making them cost-effective, not to mention sustainable. PILAR VILADAS"

The DVD isn't dead yet, but it's definitely looking a little peaked, at least in the eyes of the home-video industry. Sales continue to decline (volume is down about 40 percent from this time last year for the Top 20 titles, according to Home Media Magazine), the formerly ubiquitous neighborhood rental shops have all but vanished (Blockbuster, once the dominant franchise, has plunged into bankruptcy), and the major studios have drastically cut back on full-scale releases of library titles."

And though the establishment sells a large selection of coffee drinks, it also offers full breakfast, lunch and dinner menus. Seating (for about 50) is mixed, too, with four booths, a handful of small round tables and three game tables for checkers, chess and backgammon. One long wall is a painter's palette of colors (overlapping patches of purple, red, blue, yellow and green), with small oil paintings hung against it.

2011-03-06T00:00:00Z,"THE Jaguar E-Type can tick all the boxes for almost any car collector. Beautiful, fast and descended from a line of Le Mans-winning racecars, only their lack of rarity -- more than 72,000 were built from 1961-74 -- keeps them off the A-list of collectible European sports cars. But accessibility has always been part of the Jaguar equation: even new, the cars offered performance and looks on par with European exotics that cost much more. As one would expect of a car produced for more than a decade, some models are far more desirable than others. Collectors prize the Series I cars, made in 1961-68, because they are the most faithful to the original design, with attractive features like covered headlights and the elliptical front grille opening that became a Jaguar hallmark."

Despite an abundance of talent, the reconfigured Knicks will have to get through another week of jelling on the fly, especially on defense.

While organs from living donors are usually directed to a particular person, kidneys from the deceased are distributed under a formula devised by the network. The proposal is supposed to provide deceased-donor kidneys of higher quality to healthier, younger patients instead of to elderly ones who presumably have fewer years to live."

That oversight is about to be rectified: Ballet Theater announced Monday that Mr. Ratmansky would be creating a new version, with scenery by Simon Pastukh and costumes by Galina Solovyeva, to have its premiere next March during the company's Costa Mesa, Calif., engagement.

We know this because the Heat's coach, Erik Spoelstra, said so in his postgame comments: ""This is painful for every single one of us to go through this, there are a couple of guys crying in the locker room right now, it is not a matter of want."" As you'd imagine, the general reaction hasn't been one of extending gestures of comfort (for example). And you have to wonder what Spoelstra was thinking when he went all confessional, even if he didn't name names - didn't he learn anything from all that grief John Boehner recently had to put up with over his weepiness?

They were joined (with caveats) by an increasingly assertive Senator John Kerry, who insisted that a no-fly zone did not necessitate a military attack per se, contradicting Defense Secretary Gates's statement on March 2. The question of American policy on intervention in Libya has been murky; Hillary Clinton seemed a bit more hawkish than the president for a while, as did Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain. Obama has been getting real results on Libya at the United Nations - in the Security Council, at the General Assembly and even in Geneva at the Human Rights Council. But in American politics, successes at the U.N. are not to be spoken of. Americans may have lost their taste for unilateral actions, but they haven't gained one for multilateral actions either.Then how about some Special Forces sneaking about, as a sop to pride or at least an outlet for the national sense of adventure? Britain's experience last week suggests caution is in order. A report in The Guardian this morning says a fellow named only Tom, whom the paper believes to be a British intelligence agent, had been working at the Al-Khadra Farm Company - which raises wheat southwest of Benghazi, Libya - for five months, until last Thursday, when he drove off into the desert at 3 a.m. with another foreign national, later returning with ""large bags"" and six armed Special Air Service men. Guards at the farm arrested them. That must have had a wilting effect on the S.A.S. men's spirits. But farm personnel gave them a good hot breakfast and packed them off, and by Sunday the little band was safely away to Malta."

He went on to Dartmouth College, where his many college activities included serving as editor of Daily Dartmouth and as President of The Arts, The Round Table, and The Junto, and membership in Palaeopitus and Casque & Gauntlet. He graduated with honors in history in 1934. His business career led to his becoming a partner in Cresap McCormick & Paget, Management Consultants, and then vice president and director of American Securities Corp. In 1963, Mr. Hess conceived and created a new form of private investment firm which, in 1968, became American Euro pean Associates. Thus began his legendary career as a pioneer in private equity. Known since then as AEA Investors Inc., AEA, initially with financial support and endorsement of S.G. Warburg & Co. and shortly thereafter from senior members of the Rockefeller, Mellon, Harriman, Du Pont and other major families, was the first privately funded organization devoted solely to direct equity investment. From the outset and still today, its ownership and direction has been dominated by the chairmen and chief executive officers of many of America's leading corporations. The firm is now global in its reach with shareholder/participants of the same prominence and achievement in Europe, Asia, South and Central America, and the Middle East. As Chairman Emeritus, Mr. Hess remained active in the firm and was a regular presence in the AEA offices until shortly before his death. Ever loyal to Dartmouth College, he was a member of the Dean's Council and the President's Leadership Council. He was a member of The Rockefeller University Council and served on its Executive Committee. He was also on the Oversight Committee for Preservation of Objects at the Metropolitan Museum. He was predeceased by his beloved brother and friend, John D. Hess. He is survived by: his wife, Ludmila Schwarzenberg Hess; his son, Eric Hess and his daughter-in-law, June Hess; his daughter, Safiya Bonaventura; five grandchildren: Arden Hess Rowland and her husband Walter, and Aram, Joachim and his wife Kisha, Fleur and Claire Williams; one adored great-granddaughter, Wyatt Rowland; two nephews, Anthony and Oliver and his wife Leslie Hess; and two grand-nephews, John and Carl Hess. He is also survived by his first wife, Juliet Forbes. He was predeceased by his second wife, Desanka Pavlu, in 1990. Funeral services will be private.

Here he is yet to this day, all 22 marble tons of him, heroically stationed outside Queens Borough Hall with weapon in hand, quite unmistakably beating up on a couple of women who are cringing at his feet. And still to this day he remains sourly unloved by assorted indignants who deem him rude at the very least and want him gone. Now Representative Anthony D. Weiner has become the latest in a long parade of public scolds calling on the city to toss Rough Boy out. ''Ugly and offensive,'' declaims the art-critic congressman. ''It's time for him to go.'' For nearly 90 years now this has been going on. Rough Boy has never much enjoyed welcome-wagon hospitality, not since the day he was first unveiled in 1922. But perhaps he has found his home at last, now that the keepers of Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn -- recognizing that he is, of course, the last masterwork of the American sculptor Frederick MacMonnies -- are offering to salvage him from the pit and the abyss and give him shelter in their bosky glades."

Actually, on a recent weekday, Imrie, 39, was aboard a sailboat anchored somewhere in the French West Indies, when he was prompted, via e-mail, to recount his life thus far - a life that has been so peripatetic, romantic and unlikely that it's almost obnoxious. Imrie quit college to assist Bruce Weber, went on to work on a horse farm in Montauk, N.Y., then movedto Amish country, where he salvaged crumbling barns. He spent a year studying the New Testament (in Greek). Then he biked from Los Angeles, his current home base, to Brazil. At one point, he decided to start Julian Boots, his stylish take on 19th-century footwear (from about $700, at Barneys New York), but first he learned how to make molds in the English Midlands and to tan leather in a 250-year-old Swiss factory. Now he's an amateur boot historian, able to slip easily into a disquisition on what a 19th-century Cornish miner might wear. What his boots share with their fuss-free forebears, Imrie says, is that ''you can use them in your garden and then rub them off and go to a wedding.''"

2011-03-08T00:00:00Z,"American Ballet Theater is no stranger to ''The Firebird'': the troupe already has in its repertory several versions of the ballet set to Stravinsky's 1910 score. But none of those were by its artist in residence, Alexei Ratmansky. That oversight is about to be rectified: Ballet Theater announced Monday that Mr. Ratmansky would be creating a new version, with scenery by Simon Pastukh and costumes by Galina Solovyeva, to have its premiere next March during the company's Costa Mesa, Calif., engagement. New Yorkers will get to see the production during the spring 2012 season at the Metropolitan Opera House. For those keeping score at home, this will be Ballet Theater's fourth production of ''The Firebird'' and the choreographer's second -- he created a version for the Royal Swedish Ballet in 2002. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2011-03-08T00:00:00Z,"As the Green Day song in Broadway's ''American Idiot'' goes, ''give me novacaine'' - please. In its first week of performances without the band's frontman, Billie Joe Armstrong, as the special guest star in the cast, ''American Idiot'' saw a painful drop in its box office grosses, falling from $1.3 million to $395,275 for its standard eight performances through Sunday. While many musicals and plays also sold fewer tickets in what is typically a poor-selling week on Broadway's calendar, ''American Idiot'' declined the most and ran to only half-full houses. That sort of steep fall-off, with no obvious turnaround strategy in sight, usually leads a Broadway show to post a closing notice. Asked on Monday if one was coming for ''American Idiot,'' a spokesman for the show declined to comment. The lead producers were not immediately available for comment."

H.A.E.S. is based on the idea that ""the best way to improve health is to honor your body,"" and it supports the adoption of good health habits simply for the sake of health and well-being rather than weight control.Bacon and Lucy Aphramor, a National Health Service specialist dietitian and an honorary research fellow at the Applied Research Center in Health and Lifestyle Interventions at Coventry University in England, published a paper in Nutrition Journal earlier this year. It argues that a weight-focused approach geared toward losing weight is - surprise! - not especially effective in either reducing the weight or creating healthier bodies. In fact, they say, such an approach can unintentionally lead to weight gain and worse health."

2011-03-09T13:15:46Z,"""Maira Kalman: Various Illuminations (of a Crazy World),"" which opens Friday at the Jewish Museum, will be catnip to fans of the artist, whose books, New Yorker covers and illustrated online columns for The New York Times are beloved for their humor, whimsy and insight, and rendered with an irresistible eye for color and composition. The exhibition, which was curated by Ingrid Schaffner for the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia, features 100 of Kalman's paintings, drawings and sketches, along with photographs, embroidery and other works, including her fabric and digital wall covering for Maharam. The paintings take up two of the show's three galleries; the third is filled with objects that regularly find their way from Kalman's life to her art, like a jar of buttons, a Slinky or the pink-wrapped gift package from India that she deemed too beautiful ever to be opened. (Kalman's painting of that package can be seen in the first gallery.) An early version of the unforgettable ""New Yorkistan"" cover that she and Rick Meyerowitz did for The New Yorker is particularly fascinating, but then so is a broom that hangs - from a hardware-store clip - on the bright red wall that introduces the show. Next to it, Kalman wrote that when the broom was missing, viewers could find her sweeping the sidewalk on the park side of Fifth Avenue, a task she performs regularly as a volunteer for the Central Park Conservancy. Her accumulations of stuff, including chairs and ladders made by her children, Alex and Lulu, look oddly at home in the galleries, with their high ceilings and elaborately carved woodwork, and her decision to put two tufted poufs, covered in the Maharam fabric, in the middle of the second gallery adds to the show's hospitable air, as if Kalman might appear at any moment with tea and cookies. She will, however, be at the museum on March 11 and 18 from 2 to 4 in the afternoon, to sell (with the proceeds going to charity) some of her signature subject matter (like egg slicers or cans of mushy peas) as well as pieces from her own collection that, she said, ""no longer need to be owned by me."" The exhibition runs through July 31."

Or maybe he hasn't: it all depends how you interpret a statement Mr. Collins, one of the most popular performers of the 1980s and '90s, has posted on his Web site explaining why he is ''stopping'' his creative activities. Mr. Collins, who turned 60 in January, was responding to a flurry of reports over the weekend, mostly in the British media, that he was officially retiring, with the reasons supplied ranging from medical problems to his supposed disappointment with the performance of his last CD, ''Going Back,'' a Motown covers record released last year, which went to No. 1 in Great Britain. Many of those articles, ''have ended up painting a picture of me that is more than a little distorted,'' in which he ''sounds like a tormented weirdo,'' Mr. Collins writes, so ''I would like to add my comments and explain again why I am calling it a day.''

2011-03-09T00:00:00Z,"When Rosanne Olken walks into a new cafe, it is her vision that is on overdrive. She cannot take her eyes off a juicy hamburger. The details on the menu are more intriguing than the food itself. For as long as she can remember, Ms. Olken, 34, has not been able to taste or smell. While many people wonder how she feels about it, she does not miss what she has never known. She considers New York's restaurants, bakeries and food trucks to be atmospheric experiences. ''For me,'' she said, ''the excitement is about the company.'' Ms. Olken, a native of Manhattan, now works in market research. If there is a positive side to her sensory deprivation, it might be an absence of temptation. Food, for her, is functional. At new restaurants, she feeds on the excitement of others. But there are times when gastronomic trends do not translate. ''Truffle oil,'' she said. ''What is that all about?'' This series presents multiple-exposure portraits of perceptions of the city described by New Yorkers missing one or more senses. Earlier in the series: nytimes.com/lens."

U.A.W. members have worked at several joint ventures involving American and foreign carmakers and in a Volkswagen plant in Pennsylvania that operated from 1978 to 1988; it is not the case that the U.A.W. has yet to succeed in organizing American plants operated by foreign carmakers. One plant in Normal, Ill., started as a joint venture involving Mitsubishi and Chrysler, continues to operate under Mitsubishi's control alone. It is thus not the case that no plants operated by foreign carmakers are currently unionized."

Aitken’s 2006 book “Broken Screen,” which featured interviews with everyone from Robert Altman to Rem Koolhaas, challenged the convention of the linear narrative. Now, with his latest video project, Patterns & Repetitions, the artist sits down with a whole new cast in an attempt to put the pieces of the creative puzzle back together again. There’s Jacques Herzog on instinct and architecture; the artist Mike Kelley talking about Detroit, his hometown; and Jack White weighing in on Michelangelo as a modern-day blogger. This week, The Moment features LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy on the sound of snow. But don’t be fooled by the coffee mugs and the California sunshine. Aitken doesn’t do anything casually. The subtext of the conversations is nothing less than the future of art itself."

In France, he found more prosperous Roma, whose Gypsy caravans now include Ferraris and inflatable kiddie pools filled with ice and Kronenbourg beer. Meanwhile, Iain McKell's ""The New Gypsies"" (Prestel, $40) zooms in on a group unrelated to the Roma, the anarchic vagabonds known in Britain as ""horse-drawns,"" who coalesced with anti-Thatcherite movements in the 1980s.

2011-03-11T08:01:48Z,"It takes me, on average,  5.1 seconds to start and begin using my first-generation Apple iPad.

2011-03-11T07:30:54Z,"Alexander Wang is still flying high from the excitement of his newly opened SoHo flagship store. To keep the momentum going, Wang has introduced an exclusive all-leather collection of some of his favorite styles from the past. ""We wanted to create special product for the store that felt very classic and representative of our DNA,"" he says of the reinvented six best-selling silhouettes - the fishtail parka, tank bra, aviator jacket, trench vest, overall dress and tailored shorts. The skillful deployment of leather, the placement of smooth patched pockets and asymmetrical buckles, and the contour seaming reaffirms the young designer's uncanny eye for subtlety."
2011-03-11T07:30:44Z,"The other morning, I went for a grocery run. I parked my car and made a mental note of the aisle number, remembered to take in my reusable shopping bags, and although there was a ""slight hitch in my git-a-long,"" as the old saying goes, I was feeling pretty, pretty good."
2011-03-11T07:30:19Z,"The text you're reading right now is set in Georgia, one of the most common typefaces used online. You'll see it on countless other sites. It was released by Microsoft 15 years ago and was designed specifically for the screen by Matthew Carter, a legendary typographer and AIGA medalist. Five years ago, Alice Rawsthorn wrote a comprehensive article in The International Herald Tribune about the development of this face and its popularity. Despite vast developments in display technology and typefaces produced for use on screens since then, Georgia still proves to be so reliable and legible that, chances are, you haven't noticed it."

2011-03-11T06:31:11Z,"You know that $9 billion in annual N.F.L. revenue we keep hearing about, that the owners and players are bickering over? Tiki Barber wants some of that. The former New York Giants running back, who quit after the 2006 season, has turned in his unretirement papers. The widespread assumption is that the soon-to-be-36-year-old, whose broadcasting career and marriage have both foundered badly, needs the money. And that's a mercenary motive that makes some people mad, apparently, and some people sad. (If you're John Riggins, age 63, it makes you want to throw on the old leather helmet again.) It also prompts one Mike to ask the other Mike on ""Mike and Mike in the Morning,"" on ESPN Radio, if it's even possible for a football player like Barber to succeed in coming back if his primary motivation is money and not a raging love for the game. Mike (the former football-playing one) expresses doubt, says it would be hard. A coach in the N.F.L., Raheem Morris, who happens to coach Tiki's twin brother, Ronde, says you have to have ""the heart and the desire and the fire."""

2011-03-11T06:00:09Z,"This week's magazine column is a contemporary chicken dinner that doesn't waste a single part of the bird, at least the way most birds are packed. (It's best to make if you start with a whole chicken, one you take apart yourself: video here.) I make good stock in which I braise thighs and vegetables; on those I roast the breasts; and, for a snack, or salad, I make crispy chicken-skin croutons. I had two inspirations for the piece, both recipes from Minimalist columns I wrote years ago."
2011-03-11T06:00:09Z,"This past weekend, I went to Arizona with my colleague Chris Liss, who wrote a post about his American League team in the annual League of Alternative Baseball Reality auction. L.A.B.R. is the oldest industry league, and I was responsible for the N.L. side.

And that was the only direct reference to recent derailments: the fact that the band had to move elsewhere last year on its visit to New York, breaking a 20-year ritual for its annual string of gigs that have become the band's most important live shows, or that Gregg Allman, the keyboardist and principal singer, now 63, had undergone a liver transplant nine months ago. (The band's 2010 concerts took place instead at the United Palace Theater in Washington Heights, after Cirque du Soleil had booked the Beacon through the spring.)"

2011-03-11T04:00:08Z,"Lil B first hit in 2006, at 16, when his group the Pack and its song ""Vans"" lionized the eponymous skate shoe that had, until then, most definitely not been associated with hip-hop style. (The song was unsponsored, akin to what Run D.M.C. did in the '80s with their song ""My Adidas."") As a solo artist, the Bay Area rapper has continued against the grain. Last year's album ""Rain in England"" melded ambient with rap, perhaps for the first time. A collaborative track with the goth-y Chicago/Michigan trio Salem in late 2010 demonstrated refreshing cross-genre (or subgenre) knowledge. Without being politically correct, Lil B is adept at playing clever word games to undermine some of the negative tropes inherent to hip-hop; his trademark boast - the constantly recycled lyric ""I'm a pretty bitch"" - uses egotism to unravel misogyny. In three years he has posted enough clips to his YouTube page - more than 240 songs, videos, remixes, video remakes and rambling commentaries - to create something of a canon. Those who explore it tend to grow obsessed."

2011-03-11T00:00:00Z,"Brooklyn Heights, the brownstone and red-brick bastion of families new and old, has seen a crime spree of sorts: four burglaries in the past five days. But none of the burglaries came from a forced entry, a broken window. Instead, the burglars simply let themselves in through windows, or doors that residents, perhaps overly confident, had left open. Police officers from the 84th Precinct alerted the executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association about the burglaries, and the director, Judy Stanton, sent out an e-mail to 1,200 neighbors on Thursday morning. ''This neighborhood is so safe, but not everybody puts on their city smarts and remembers to do the common sense thing and lock their doors,'' she said. Not everybody thought they had to -- until Thursday."

2011-03-11T00:00:00Z,"The rap artist 50 Cent has made a donation to charity after revelations that he performed for the clan of Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Reuters reported on Thursday. ''In light of the ongoing events in Libya, 50 Cent will be making a donation to UNICEF, which is providing vital relief supplies to meet the needs of women and children at risk during this crisis,'' a spokesman for the artist told E! News. The rapper, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, joined what one entertainment Web site called the ''Qaddafi performance regret club'' - pop stars who sometimes earned seven-figure sums performing for members of Qaddafi's family at exclusive parties around the world. These include Beyonce, Nelly Furtado, Mariah Carey and Usher, all of whom have issued statements saying they would donate or had already given money to charities. The appearances have become a major source of embarrassment since the Libyan leader's brutal response to a popular uprising against him in Libya. 50 Cent earned an undisclosed amount from a private concert during the 2005 Venice film festival.

The proceeds from the sale at Bonhams - at which every lot sold -- will go to the 65-year-old rock star's Crossroads Center drug and alcohol treatment facility in the Caribbean. The auction - the proceeds of which totaled around $1.8 million without the buyer's premium - also included instruments donated by Mr. Clapton's musician friends Jeff Beck, J.J. Cale and Joe Bonamassa. Among the top lots was a 1948 Gibson L-5P, which was expected to bring $20,000 to $30,000 but raised $82,960; a 2005 Zemaitis S22BP 3S, estimated at $12,000 to $18,000, which sold for $75,640; and a pair of 1997 Fender Twin Amps, estimated at $9,000 to $12,000, which sold for $42,700.

2011-03-12T00:00:00Z,"The controversial National Portrait Gallery exhibition ''Hide/Seek'' may come to the Brooklyn Museum, the museum's spokeswoman, Sally Williams, said on Friday. The show, which examined gay and lesbian themes in American portraiture, won critical praise when it opened in October but later drew attacks from Republicans and religious conservatives over a video that included an image of ants crawling on a plastic crucifix. In response, the Smithsonian Institution removed the video from the show, prompting accusations of censorship and moving dozens of museums across the country to display the video and other works by the artist, David Wojnarowicz, in protest. ''Hide/Seek'' closed last month, but now the Brooklyn Museum and the Tacoma Art Museum in Washington State are collaborating to reconstitute it, Rock Hushka, the director of curatorial administration at the Tacoma museum, said. Mr. Hushka said that the planning was on a fast track, with an eye to the exhibition possibly opening in Brooklyn before the end of the year, and eventually going to Tacoma. Asked if the Wojnarowicz video would be included, Mr. Hushka and Ms. Williams both said yes. ''We are very keen on making sure that we represent the National Portrait Gallery's presentation as fully as possible,'' Mr. Hushka said."

But once back in time, before the plague has struck, James is considered a lunatic and begins to fear for his sanity. Dr. Kathryn Railly (Ms. Stowe), a psychiatrist in the mental hospital where he has been committed, starts to take his dire predictions for humanity seriously.

(HBO) THE BOX (2009) Working from a short story by the fantasy writer Richard Matheson, the director Richard Kelly (''Donnie Darko'') has written and directed what Manohla Dargis described in her review in The Times as a ''sincere and sinister and inevitably ambitious'' film that asks questions about the human condition. It is 1976, and a couple short of cash receive an offer: push a button on a curious box and receive a million dollars. There is one pesky problem: in doing so, they will murder someone. Cameron Diaz and James Marsden play the couple to whom a mysterious man (Frank Langella) proposes the deal.

2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"I have long enjoyed the magazine as the must-read component of your increasingly expensive publication. The Feb. 27 issue, however, was for me a barrage of bad news. First I read that this column would be Randy Cohen's last as the Ethicist. Cohen's elegant, understated responses to ethical quandaries were the first words I read in each edition of the magazine, and I am already wondering how Sundays will be the same without his work. Next I read that this would be the final column for Virginia Heffernan and The Medium. As the Internet becomes an ever-more integral part of our lives -- my wife and I often ask each other as we look up a recipe or bit of trivia, ''What did we do before the Internet?'' -- it would seem that such a column would be indispensable. Finally, and perhaps most troubling for a high-school English teacher and lover of language, was Ben Zimmer's announcement that this would be his final On Language column. Zimmer performed admirably in the unenviable task of replacing William Safire. In this time of rapid changes in the development of language -- the redefinition of what is acceptable, the spectrum of global influences and so on -- a column like this is essential. GLEN M. MARTIN Adamstown, Pa., e-mail"
2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"The Sports of The Times column last Sunday, about the Polytechnic Institute of New York University cricket team, which gathered on March 4 to watch the Cricket World Cup together, contained several errors. Sricharan Rangarajan -- not Raugarajan Sricharan -- was one team member who watched the matches. One of his teammates is Dhaval Dharaiya, not Dhaval Charaiya. Ricky Ponting, the captain of Australia's World Cup team is 36, not 39.

Chad Cunningham of IronHorse Capital Management, after stocks fell sharply worldwide Thursday."
2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"For seven years, Josh Winters partied with the Mideast elite and lived to tell about it. This is the story of a person who does not claim to be a fighter for patriotic causes, a political leader or diplomat, it is merely a story of an ordinary citizen, who found himself thrust into the midst of events he had no choice but to be a part of - events he could neither evade or distance himself from, as they unfolded. This is just a story of a Yemeni citizen.''- Mohsin Alaini from his book, '' 50 Years in Shifting Sands,'' translated by Hassan al-Haifi."
2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"You wrote these books quickly, in weeklong spurts of 10,000 words a day. Why the nom de plume? After ''The City and the Pillar,'' which was a cheery tale of two boys who were in love with each other, Orville Prescott of The New York Times, a very distinguished newspaper of yesteryear, said that he would never review a book by me, much less read one. And he said that to Nicholas Wreden, who was the head of E. P. Dutton, who was my publisher."
2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"The first sports work stoppage of the social networking era has left N.F.L. players concerned, confused and a little distracted. But they were chatty and -- at least temporarily -- united. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers sounded a one-word rallying cry on Twitter just minutes after union decertification became official: ''Unity.'' Moments later, Rodgers acknowledged that there were more important things happening in the world than a football labor dispute. ''Lots of stuff in the news today, but let's remember the people in Japan and keep them in our thoughts and prayers.''"
2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"Last summer, when Bruce Pask, our men's fashion director, returned from the European collections, we sat down to talk about what he had seen on the catwalk. There was a double-breasted jacket that had turned up everywhere. There were superskinny suits, which hadn't looked so good and so right since the photographer Hedi Slimane defined Dior Homme. There were black watches, white bucks, Breton stripes and goofy brights. We talked trend, and then we talked men. We weren't just after clothes with character; we were looking for character. Stephen Heyman found it in Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet cosmonaut whose life is brilliantly rendered in Jamie Doran and Piers Bizony's ''Starman.'' Jacob Brown brought in Rockstar Charlie -- a downtown boxing hopeful -- and a daring Californian who had had seven years of living dangerously in Yemen and the Horn of Africa. The entire team went mad for a pitcher with balletic form and skater hair. And a real skater -- the legendary Erik Ellington -- agreed to don double-breasted Tom Ford under the canny direction of Magnus Unnar and David Vandewal. Finally, Mikael Jansson and Bill Mullen, over a period of months and endless air miles, put the shrunken suit on the men who have earned the right to publicly flaunt their forms forever. (In addition to that noir watch and easy espadrilles, the real must-have for spring 2011? Iggy Pop's abs regimen. Tape the picture on Page 115 to fridge door now.)"
2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,An article last Sunday about Pat Summitt's pursuit of a ninth national championship with the Tennessee women's basketball team erroneously attributed a distinction to the team in some editions.

2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"Once a sleepy residential area, the Milan neighborhood of Isola, which translates as ''island'' (thanks, perhaps, to its once being relatively isolated from the rest of the city), is now attracting its share of artists, designers and young, newly married couples. Along with this shift, a homegrown boutique scene is emerging. Via Pastrengo and Via Pepe, two adjacent Isola streets, look unassuming and quiet but are in fact lined with chic stores tucked into apartment buildings. And since most shops do double duty as workshops for their artisan owners, shoppers can get a close-up view of the creative process behind the goods. SHIVANI VORA"

2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"An obituary last Sunday about the former major league baseball player Greg Goossen paraphrased incorrectly from a comment that the pitcher Jim Bouton made about Goossen in his book ''Ball Four.'' He said Goossen was the only one of a group of players released by the Seattle Pilots early in spring training who interested him -- not the only one of all his Seattle teammates. The obituary also gave the incorrect context for a statement by Howard Megdal in the introduction of his book ''The Baseball Talmud,'' about Jews in major league baseball. When Megdal said, ''I am a baseball expert, not a Judaism expert,'' he was referring to what he called the ''expansive definition of Jewish'' he used to decide who belonged in the book, which included ''a player whose father is Jewish,'' as was Goossen's. Megdal was not answering a question about why he included Goossen, a Roman Catholic, on a list of Jewish first basemen."

She was a former prime minister of Britain then, not the incumbent."
2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"The fashion shows in Paris last week were a profound change from the theatrics and wild exaggerations of the last two decades that had been spearheaded by British designers, some of whose lives ended in tragedy. The Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld's presentation in the Grand Palais seemed to capture the upheaval. His set of moldering ruins suggested the immolation of the gods in Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle, as did his Gothic palette. The self-destruction of John Galliano, the design director for Dior, intensified the gloom. But like a phoenix rising out of the ashes, the elegant jewel-toned collection of Haider Ackermann (top row) signaled fashion's new direction. Other houses that showed new creative fire include Balenciaga (on the tile floors, far left); Céline (the fantastic princess-seamed dress on the runway, left); Junya Watanabe (motorcycle jackets, left); Gareth Pugh (metallic coat, right), and Rick Owens (coat and blue dresses, far right)."
2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"What is it about rock stars and their hair? Since the Strokes burst onto the scene in 2001, reinvigorating rock 'n' roll with an injection of garage rawness, they've spawned as many imitators of their style as of their sound. (Their new album, ''Angles,'' is a welcome return to their signature muddy riffs and aloof vocals.) And even more than their perfect leather jackets and smoking hot girlfriends, their artfully undone manes scream rock hero status. Virtual hairdo deities, the band has no doubt inspired more than a few makeovers in its time. As evidenced by the photographs here, the five musicians have very different relationships with scissors. But all share the same D.I.Y. (or don't do much at all) attitude. There was no primping on set. In fact, they barely looked at themselves. ''I don't cut it. I don't wash it,'' says Nick Valensi, one of the band's guitarists, about his sexy shag. ''It looks weird when it's clean, so I only shampoo it about 10 times a year.'' Instead, he squeezes fresh lemons onto his scalp. ''I like to think it helps with the pH balance.'' This is typical rock-star hair behavior, according to April Barton, who tends to the tresses of Bono, Elvis Costello and Rufus Wainwright at Suite 303, her buzzy salon in Manhattan's Chelsea Hotel. ''The very purpose of rock hair is to be low maintenance,'' she says. ''The minute my guys leave me, they can go on tour for four months and not think about it.'' Barton, who considers herself the master of the rock cut, has been doing it for 25 years. ''I have a philosophy about it,'' she says. ''It all comes from somewhere. Look, the Stones had that great, greasy texture everyone still tries to copy because they were jamming, having sex, doing drugs and sweating for five days straight.''"

2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"Lin Gathright: I'm performing in a burlesque show, and so I look at the picture, and it's not Lin Gathright, it's a character I play, Bunny Love. I call it my ''Smoking Number'' because I hold the cigarette in my mouth the entire time, and with the feather boas involved, there's a sense of danger, like, ''Is she going to burn herself?'' Or, ''Is she going to catch on fire?'' And you never see anything until the very end, when I drop the boa and pose in all my glory, there with my glitter-covered nipples and my one feather and let the audience take that in. Then I take the cigarette out of my mouth and flick it at them and walk off. It's kind of mean-spirited, and I always feel a little bad about it after, but I think they love to hate me. Pari Dukovic: I was standing at the side of the stage, and you could feel the crowd's attention while she was doing this act. It's almost like the air got thicker. She was drawing them into her world. I've seen a lot of these shows, and people dance and they do all kinds of things. But she was just walking around like: ''I'm here whether you want it or not. I'm here.''"

The designer Richard Chai says its carefree attitude and eclectic fans have inspired his quirky urban version, which pairs patent leather with canvas in unusual colors like ultramarine and moss green. Lanvin's take looks like Transformers, with straps crisscrossing every which way. And Tomas Maier at Bottega Veneta took his jewel-toned leather Tevas on a trip, sporting gray dress socks for a high-luxe touristy look. I wouldn't recommend giving those a dunk in the deep end.

His hair, which he hadn't cut since leading the San Francisco Giants to their first World Series in more than 50 years - and didn't intend to cut anytime soon unless his manager, Bruce Bochy, ordered otherwise - was pulled back into a ponytail. A mustache, if the underseeded patch of grass beneath his nose could be called that, had sprouted up during the off-season, giving him the aspect of a teenager trying to avoid getting carded. ''That desk manager is really sexy,'' Lincecum's agent, Rick Thurman, who had flown up from Los Angeles for the day, volunteered from the back seat as we emerged from the basement garage of Lincecum's apartment building, a 30-story glass tower in downtown Seattle."

(The song was unsponsored, akin to what Run D.M.C. did in the '80s with their song ''My Adidas.'') As a solo artist, the Bay Area rapper has continued against the grain. Last year's album ''Rain in England'' melded ambient with rap, perhaps for the first time. A collaborative track with the goth-y Chicago/Michigan trio Salem in late 2010 demonstrated refreshing cross-genre (or subgenre) knowledge. Without being politically correct, Lil B is adept at playing clever word games to undermine some of the negative tropes inherent to hip-hop; his trademark boast - the constantly recycled lyric ''I'm a pretty bitch'' - uses egotism to unravel misogyny. In three years he has posted enough clips to his YouTube page - more than 240 songs, videos, remixes, video remakes and rambling commentaries - to create something of a canon. Those who explore it tend to grow obsessed. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"N.H.L. general managers will be under intense public scrutiny when they convene for their annual meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., beginning Monday. Under pressure from medical researchers, owners and even players, the general managers are expected to strengthen Rule 48, the league's bylaw governing checks to the head, which was instituted this season. But they will probably not establish a ban on head contact like the rule in the International Ice Hockey Federation, the Ontario Hockey League and the N.C.A.A. After speaking to all 30 G.M.'s last week, Bob McKenzie of the Canadian network TSN reported that they were likely to stop short of a ban, but the movement toward more stringency is palpable. At last year's meeting, the general managers came up with a draft form of what became Rule 48, which barred blindside hits to the head and checks that take aim at the head. A steady drumbeat of medical evidence from doctors and researchers showed the damage caused to hockey players from repeated blows to the head, and as recently as a few weeks ago, the league seemed satisfied with what it had done. Comments by the managers at the board of governors meeting in December indicated that Rule 48 was having the desired effect: deterring players from taking aim at one another's heads. At the All-Star Game at the end of January, Commissioner Gary Bettman said that although concussions were slightly up this season, the number resulting from head shots was actually down - and he credited Rule 48. At that time, the top agenda item for the Boca Raton meeting was shaping up to be a possible crackdown on checks from behind. But a recent pileup of unusually bad, headline-grabbing news put concussion prevention front and center again. The frightening injury of the Canadiens' Max Pacioretty after he was shoved into a stanchion by the Bruins' Zdeno Chara; a recent study that found concussion-induced chronic traumatic encephalopathy in Bob Probert's brain; and Sidney Crosby's two-month absence because of a concussion caused both by a hit to the head and by a later check from behind have led to a public outcry in favor of more stringent rules governing head shots, or at least stronger disciplinary measures to prevent them. In a letter to the N.H.L., Air Canada said that the airline would withdraw its sponsorship if the league did not improve player safety. And in an op-ed article published in Saturday's Globe and Mail of Toronto and Le Presse of Montreal, Ken Dryden called for the managers to do more to prevent concussions. ''Arguments and explanations don't matter anymore,'' wrote Dryden, the Canadiens' Hall of Fame goalie of the 1970s and a member of Parliament. ''The N.H.L. has to risk taking the big steps that are needed: if some of them prove wrong, they'll still be far less wrong than what we have now. It is time to stop being stupid.''"

''I thought the movie wasn't going to happen'' after Jesse Eisenberg dropped out to star in ''The Social Network,'' recalls Winkler (the son of Henry). Angarano, who originally had a supporting role, read for the part of Sam, and as clichéd as it may sound, the director cannot imagine making the movie, which opens April 8, with anyone else.

2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"LEXINGTON, Ky. - In the seemingly incomprehensible symbolism of alchemy, the copulation of kings and queens is viewed as a marriage of lower-value base elements like copper and iron to produce nature's most precious metal, gold. That such a crude commercial endeavor ultimately pushed the alchemists to the margins of the scientific community and earned them infamy as charlatans has not diverted the breeders of thoroughbred racehorses from undertaking a modern version of this murky, barely respectable and mystical art."

2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"In ''Gypsies'' (powerhouse Books, $45), out in May, the photographer Patrick Cariou retraced the migration of the Romany people from northern to southern Europe, the Middle East and ultimately to India, their ancestral homeland. Along the way, he encountered Gypsies making sausage on the floor of a Romanian hovel, and living in weirdly beautiful shantytowns in Slovakia and tents in Afghanistan. In France, he found more prosperous Roma, whose Gypsy caravans now include Ferraris and inflatable kiddie pools filled with ice and Kronenbourg beer. Meanwhile, Iain McKell's ''The New Gypsies'' (Prestel, $40) zooms in on a group unrelated to the Roma, the anarchic vagabonds known in Britain as ''horse-drawns,'' who coalesced with anti-Thatcherite movements in the 1980s. They have fair skin, and their wagons recall medieval fairs more readily than Romania, but the kinship between these Gypsy tribes, new and old, seems somehow more than contrived."

2011-03-13T00:00:00Z,"SOME may think maple-syrup-making can only happen in Vermont or Canada. But if last year's little experiment sugaring in Brooklyn proved anything, it was that fine maple syrup could be made in New York City as well. I recently located a healthy sugar maple in the Stapleton section of Staten Island, and although it was already a little late in the season, I set up shop, hoping for a good run. Temperatures have to be just right for quality sap flow: more than 40 degrees in the daytime, with temperatures dipping to freezing at night. The sugar maple was in the back of my friends' property, halfway up a hilly incline, and tapping it would require lugged boots, steady legs and the ability to drill while negotiating a fence. Although I had spiles (something like spigots) with hooks from Vermont -- and thoughts of using them to hang my bucket directly from the tree the old-fashioned way -- my ''Little House'' dreams were dashed by the realities of urban tapping (a wire fence). My tapping partner and I resorted to the tried-and-true do-it-yourself approach, involving steel pipes and PVC tubing from the local hardware store."

A learned and scholarly gentleman, Mr. Muensterberger held three doctorates, in medicine, anthropology and art history. Born in Dortmund, Germany, on April 15, 1913, he began collecting African art at the age of thirteen, having been inspired to do so by his uncle, the late Baron Eduard von der Heydt, and went on to become an expert with an important collection. Best known for ""Sculpture of Primitive Man"" (1955) and ""Collecting: An Unruly Passion"" (1994), Mr. Muensterberger's books were major contributions to the literature on African, Oceanic and Native American art and the psychology of art collecting. Through his scholarship and his contagious enthusiasm he played a key role in the appreciation of the art of primordial cultures as world art.

Your life entails daily interactions with George Plimpton - editing, writing, looking for the next Philip Roth. Then, for reasons that seemed reasonable at the time, you decide to pour your life savings into a cruddy bodega in the Boerum Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn for the sake of your Korean-American wife's parents. A New York story par excellence, Ben Ryder Howe's ""My Korean Deli"" is a hilarious account of clashing cultures and backbreaking, soul-squeezing vocational juggling. Here, Howe takes questions on his life post-deli and his relationship with his stubborn Korean mother-in-law (""the Mike Tyson of Korean grandmothers""), and even offers a few pointers on what to avoid at a convenience store."

Paterniti, who recently wrote about Haiti for this magazine, also compiled a partial but fascinating oral history of the camps, which accompanies his GQ article online."

Haley Barbour of Mississippi may not yet be a Republican presidential candidate, but his travel itinerary suggests that may be simply a formality, as he visited President Obama's hometown on Monday before flying to Iowa to begin testing themes of a probable campaign.-In a luncheon speech to the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Barbour delivered a sweeping indictment of the president's economic and energy policies, saying that expanding the size of government would not lead to the creation of more jobs in the United States.-''Let's look at their record,'' he said. ''In the last two years, the federal government spent $7 trillion and our economy lost seven million jobs. I guess we ought to be glad they didn't spend $12 trillion. We might have lost 12 million jobs.''-Mr. Barbour is among the wide field of Republicans who are considering entering the fight for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. He has said that he intends to make a decision after the Mississippi legislative session ends next month.-In a 30-minute address to business leaders, Mr. Barbour offered a preview to the message of his potential candidacy, with a heavy emphasis on traditional Republican themes of economic growth, job creation and increasing oil production through expanding drilling. He delivered more criticism than specific policy proposals. -''In fairness, the Obama administration arrived in office facing some of the worst economic conditions in decades,'' Mr. Barbour said. ''But for more than two years, this administration and its Congress has pursued policy after policy that created economic uncertainty or directly hurt the economy.''-As the country's energy policy takes on heightened importance with the turmoil in the Middle East and the nuclear disaster in the wake of the earthquake in Japan, he said: ''The Obama energy policy basically boils down to this: increase the price of energy so Americans will use less of it. That's an environmental policy, not an energy policy.'' He stopped well short of declaring his intentions. In a question following the speech, a man in the audience asked if Mr. Barbour was ready to announce his presidential bid."

After less than two hours of deliberation, jurors at Crown Court in Guildford, southwest of London, ruled unanimously that the effects coordinator, Christopher Corbould, was not guilty of failing to ensure the safety of the cameraman, Conway Wickliffe. Mr. Wickliffe was killed in 2007 on the set of ''The Dark Knight,''Christopher Nolan's sequel to his superhero film ''Batman Begins,'' as he rode in a pickup truck driving parallel to a stunt car; the pickup missed a 90-degree turn and crashed into a tree. Last week, prosecutors argued that Mr. Corbould, who won an Oscar for his work on ''Inception'' and whose filmography includes several ''James Bond'' movies, did not follow proper safety guidelines in planning the stunt and that the accident was foreseeable. Mr. Wickliffe was honored in the closing credits of ''The Dark Knight,'' along with the actor Heath Ledger, who died before the film's release.

The play, ""Imagining Madoff"" by Deborah Margolin, originally depicted a close relationship between Mr. Madoff and Mr. Wiesel, who in real life lost all his and his wife's savings and $15.2 million of his charitable foundation's assets in Mr. Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Before the play's premiere at Theater J in Washington, Ms. Margolin sent Mr. Wiesel a copy of the script, hoping he would like it. Instead, he threatened to have his lawyer halt the production. Ms. Margolin agreed to revise the play, but when Theater J's artistic director, Ari Roth, volunteered to show the revised script to Mr. Wiesel's foundation, she decided to back out of the production entirely. Instead, she took the rewritten version - with Mr. Wiesel's character replaced by a fictional Holocaust survivor and poet named Solomon Galkin - to Stageworks/Hudson, a small theater company in upstate New York, where it was performed last summer. Mr. Roth saw the play there and subsequently renewed a discussion with Ms. Margolin about producing it at Theater J. The play will open on Aug. 31 and run through Sept. 25."

The new editorial, though, takes a much more unpersuasive line. After arguing, reasonably, that there are good reasons for America to wish Qaddafi gone from power, the editors go on to argue that those reasons justify establishing an American protectorate around Benghazi, so that the rebels can live to fight another day:"

2011-03-16T14:17:13Z,"A mandoline seems to be one of the last frontiers for the home cook. Maybe it seems too fussy with all those different blades, or maybe people are under the impression that you have to buy the most expensive model, which can get extremely pricey. But even the cheapest mandoline will make your life so much easier in the kitchen. For example, while I could, with much time and a little effort, thinly slice the potatoes for a gratin (such as in my column on Wednesday), running them through a mandoline takes about three minutes and gives me perfectly even, gossamer slices, which melt into the cream while baking in the oven. I also rely on my mandoline for paper-thin slices of fennel and zucchini for salads, and lovely wafers of beets that I serve carpaccio-style with a walnut-mustard dressing on top. And then there's my recipe for French apple tart, which depends on uniform slices of apple that are a breeze with a mandoline. So here are a few tips for those of you ready to take the plunge. Mandolines range in price based on the sharpness of the blade, the number of different cuts the blades will make and the sturdiness of the base.  I have used the Super Benriner (about $50), but years ago, I had the most basic Benriner ($20) and it served me just fine until the blades grew dull.  If you just want something basic, go for a cheaper model - they start somewhere around $15 (Norpro and Kyocera, for example, make them). And if you want something a bit more substantial (able to handle a more diverse range of fruits and vegetables), go for a sturdier, more advanced model. Oxo and Swissmar Borner (both about $40) are two reliable brands in this price range. And if you are looking to invest in something that will last you a lifetime and give you the widest variety of blades for different cuts, stainless steel professional models go for around $100, but you probably won't ever have to replace them. Mandolines from MIU sell for about $110; Bron has one for $150 and De Buyer's model, $229, allows for left-handed users. Most of the mandolines are compact and collapsible, which is particularly useful if you're in a tiny kitchen and space is at a premium. And if you're worried about cuts and scrapes, consider this glove, which has saved my knuckles from many an injury."

And some of the animated shorts feature the voices of David Duchovny, Joseph Fiennes and Ian McKellen. The films were chosen out of 2,862 submissions; they represent 20 countries and include 22 world premieres. Documentary subjects include a Haitian community that joins together to build a movie theater, a rock musician who decides to have transgender surgery, and a motivational speaker privately battling bipolar disorder. The narrative films include one in which a character tries to atone for a car accident that left a girl in a vegetative state; one about a man seeking justice after he thinks his son has been sexually assaulted; and - for those in search of lighter fare - a film titled ""Mr. Stache"" and described as ""the awesome adventures of a man and his mustache."" The short films will compete for three awards - Best Narrative Short, Best Documentary Short and the Student Visionary Award - with combined cash and value-in-kind prizes totaling more than $15,000. The winner of Best Narrative Short will qualify for consideration in the short-film category of the Academy Awards without the standard theatrical run.

I love everything from brussels sprouts to chard to kohlrabi, so making meat-and-potatoes dinners is really tough. And really boring. I've tried asking him for ideas on how he might like to try green beans, for example, and I offer to give him recipes, but I always get the reply that nothing sounds appetizing.

The all-day tribute begins with ''Bringing Up Baby'' (1938), Howard Hawks's screwball comedy starring Cary Grant (above, with Katharine Hepburn) as a stodgy paleontologist seeking money for his museum, and Hepburn as an eccentric heiress who throws a wrench into his game. The prime-time portion includes Morris Engel's ''Weddings and Babies'' (1958), a naturalistic study of a New York photographer (John Myhers) struggling to become financially independent, at 8; and Otto Preminger's ''Bonjour Tristesse'' (1958), an adaptation of Françoise Sagan's novel about decadent lives on the French Riviera, starring David Niven, Jean Seberg and Deborah Kerr, at 9:30.

The book, which is planned for release next year and does not yet have a title, is the first acquisition for the publishing house by Jon Meacham, the author and former Newsweek editor, who was named an executive vice president at the Random House Publishing Group in January. Mr. Meacham, a Pulitzer Prize-winner for his Andrew Jackson biography ''American Lion,'' and, like Mr. Gore a Tennessean, said in a telephone interview that the former vice president's best-selling books ''An Inconvenient Truth'' and ''The Assault on Reason'' had established him as an author who ''has been early and right'' on anticipating global trends."

2011-03-17T09:00:15Z,"It has been almost one week since the devastating earthquake and tsunami struck Japan. If, like me, you love design, you probably have a favorite Japanese designer in fashion, architecture, graphic design or ceramics. Japan is a country that has always nurtured design, from handcraft to industrially produced goods; as a result, good design has become synonymous with Japanese design. Many of the country's designers have been affected by the disaster, which continues to unfold in ways that are unfathomable to most of us. In Kasama and Mashiko, centers of ceramic production that are about halfway between Tokyo and Sendai, potters were hard hit by the quake when brick kilns collapsed and years' worth of production shattered in minutes. Moved by the desire to support their fellow artists, three enterprising women in the United States have organized Handmade for Japan, an online auction of handmade work donated by Japanese artists and American artists with ties to Japan. Ayumi Horie, a Japanese-American potter who lives in Hudson, N.Y., recruited her friends Kathryn Pombriant Manzella and Ai Kanazawa Cheung to solicit donations and set up the auction, while the illustrator David Gordon designed a logo overnight. Offers of support, in-kind donations and handmade goods have poured in via Twitter, Facebook and e-mail. And artists including the illustrator Lisa Congdon, the textile designer Kaoru Oka and the ceramists Jun Kaneko, Justin Rothshank, Kathy Erteman and Diana Fayt, to name a few, have contributed paintings, shawls and, of course, pottery. The auction will go live on eBay on March 24 and will run through March 27. Through GlobalGiving, 100 percent of the auction proceeds will support relief efforts in Japan.

The grand jury prize for a documentary went to ''Dragonslayer,'' directed by Tristan Patterson and about the life and love of a skateboarder in Fullerton, a Southern California suburb. ''Natural Selection'' also received prizes for performances by Rachael Harris and Matt O'Leary, above, and for its script, editing and score, setting it up as the big winner at a festival that focused heavily on low-budget films with small, personal stories.

''Do you want to see a crime film that makes the characters of Mickey Spillane seem like sissies and, at the same time, gives you the thrill of being an inside participant in a terrific Parisian robbery?'' In what its fans consider to be the quintessential heist film, Jean Servais plays Tony le Stéphanois, a thief fresh from prison who took the fall to protect his young protégé, Jo le Suedois (Carl Mohner). But old habits die hard, and soon he is persuaded to join Jo, an Italian pimp (Robert Manuel) and a womanizing safecracker (Mr. Dassin, under the name of Perlo Vita, above right, with Mr. Servais) to rob a jewelry store in Paris in a scene staged ''like a ballet,'' Mr. Crowther wrote. There is a poetry about the film, ''and a poetic justice too,'' he added. ''Mr. Dassin has got the tender beauty of Paris at dawn, when there is no one stirring but milkmen, street cleaners, gendarmes -- and thieves. And he has ended his film with a feeling for the pathos of the comédie humaine that would do justice to a story with a more exalting theme.'' 7 P.M.

The play, ''Imagining Madoff'' by Deborah Margolin, originally depicted a close relationship between Mr. Madoff and Mr. Wiesel, who in real life lost all his and his wife's savings and $15.2 million of his charitable foundation's assets in Mr. Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Before the premiere at Theater J in Washington, Ms. Margolin sent Mr. Wiesel a copy of the script, hoping he would like it. Instead, he threatened to have his lawyer halt the production. Ms. Margolin agreed to revise the play, but when Theater J's artistic director, Ari Roth, volunteered to show the revised script to Mr. Wiesel's foundation, she backed out of the production. She took the rewritten version -- with Mr. Wiesel's character replaced by a fictional Holocaust survivor and poet named Solomon Galkin -- to Stageworks/Hudson, a small theater company in Hudson, N.Y., where it was performed last summer. Mr. Roth saw the play there and renewed a discussion with Ms. Margolin about producing it at Theater J. The play will run from Aug. 31 to Sept. 25."

I have competed against Jalen Rose and Chris Webber since the age of 13. At Michigan, the Fab Five represented a cultural phenomenon that impacted the country in a permanent and positive way.

On Wednesday, Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities released an illustrated list of 54 objects missing from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, which was looted on Jan. 28. The list is much longer than the list of 18 missing objects that Mr. Hawass released on Feb. 13. Mr. Hawass originally claimed that nothing was missing from the museum.

2011-03-18T00:00:00Z,"CHWASKY--Milton, died on Sunday, March 13, 2011 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in his 80th year, after a long and difficult struggle with cancer. He never complained and did all that was asked of him with dignity and humanity. His wife, Suzy Carija Chwasky, was his champion and shepherded him through the sorrow of sickness and the underbelly of the health care system. Suzy brought sunshine into the last 14 years of Milton's life and they were enormously happy together in sickness and in health. He is also survived by his three children from a previous marriage, Robert, Jennifer, and Michael, his son-in-law Niles and his grandchildren Jordana and Lauren and his beloved uncle Herb and aunt Rita. Milton was born in Brooklyn and raised in the Bronx in poverty. His father, Benny, delivered seltzer bottles to walkups. Milton went to the Bronx High School of Science (1944-48) where he was the 5'10"" power forward of a team that won one game per season but never stopped trying. After a short career in real estate he got his law degree from NYU after attending night classes. He worked for Alexander H. Cohen, the Broadway impresario, during the sixties, as production associate on IVANOV with John Gielgud and Vivien Leigh and THE DEVILS starring Ann Bancroft and Jason Robards, and handling negotiations with Marlene Dietrich. In 1978 the attorneys for Muhammad Ali asked him to fill in as the attorney for Ali's next opponent Leon Spinks. Spinks unexpectedly won, and Milton's career as ""Boxing's Barrister"" was launched. He became lawyer and adviser for numerous boxers, boxing promoters, managers and casinos. He was renowned as the honest and reliable stalwart in a field where few such were to be found. His charm and quick wit served him well. Milton loved to play tennis. Taking pictures and listening to jazz were also his pleasures. During his illness he made many 'girlfriends' of the wonderful women who cared for him both at home and in the hospital. He was loved by many and will be missed greatly. In lieu of flowers it is asked that a donation be made in his name to the Southern Poverty Law Center at splcenter.org. Funeral services will be at Riverside Memorial Chapel at 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue at 11:45am on Sunday, March 20th, 2011."
2011-03-18T00:00:00Z,"In 1949, the African-American painters Charles Alston and Hale Woodruff covered the lobby walls at a Los Angeles insurance company headquarters - a trapezoidal Moderne building designed by the African-American architect Paul Williams - with murals of early black Californians including explorers, cowboys and oil riggers. Now the original owner, the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company, is being liquidated, and the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture is planning to buy the works for $750,000 and remove them from the lobby. (They have been appraised for up to $5 million.) Preservationists have filed objections, to be aired at a public hearing on March 28, and the Los Angeles Conservancy has requested city landmark protections for the building and the murals. The state's Conservation and Liquidation Office has rebuffed philanthropists' offers to buy the paintings and keep them in the lobby, said Joshua Solomon, the interim executive director of the Golden State Mutual Legacy Foundation and a former consultant to the liquidation office. Scott Pearce, a senior estate trust officer at the liquidation office, said that it would welcome bidders with substantive counter-offers to the Smithsonian proposal. ''If they're prepared to write a check, they can have the murals,'' he said."

2011-03-18T00:00:00Z,"East As it begins its N.C.A.A. tournament run in Cleveland, OHIO STATE has been deemed the No. 1 overall seed. The Buckeyes, of course, want to remain at the top when the tournament ends. Their game against No. 16 TEXAS-SAN ANTONIO won't be much of a stumbling block. No. 8 GEORGE MASON is clearly a dangerous team in the tournament (see 2006). Will the Patriots begin another run with a victory over struggling VILLANOVA, seeded ninth? After missing the tournament last season, No. 2 NORTH CAROLINA is back again and playing in the friendly environs of Charlotte against No. 15 LONG ISLAND UNIVERSITY, which owns the nation's longest current winning streak at 13 games. Charlotte is not as friendly to No. 7 WASHINGTON, which won the Pacific-10 tournament and then had to travel roughly 2,800 miles for its game against No. 10 GEORGIA. West No. 4 TEXAS struggled at the end of the season, losing four of its final eight games. Coach Rick Barnes also has a troubling history in the tournament, with his teams often going out much earlier than expected. But the main reason that No. 13 OAKLAND has some thinking upset in Tulsa, Okla., is Keith Benson, a 6-foot-11 senior who averages 18 points and 10.1 rebounds a game and could impress N.B.A. scouts with a strong showing. No. 1 DUKE does not expect much trouble from No. 16 HAMPTON, but the Blue Devils will get some playing time for the freshman point guard Kyrie Irving, out most of the season with a toe injury."

He sailed here with his mother and sister and they didn't have a penny between them. Through various friends and charities they were able to survive on the Lower Eastside. Eric took up his first job at age 14 as a furrier, and he attended classes at night. He was married in 1949 and entered the plumbing business of his father-in-law. Through a series of happenstance, he ended up founding R&C Corporation in 1962. His love and the focus of his business, was to install plumbing in schools. His dream was for his two sons, Steve and Larry, to join him and his wife in business. That dream was fulfilled in 1975. After some very tough years, the business began to blossom in the early 1980's. It was sold in 1988 to JWP, a public company (and renamed WDF Inc.). Eric left for a few years and returned to the business he loved in the late 1990's. He continued to work there until his 80th birthday in 2008. Throughout his decades in the plumbing business, he made hundreds of friends due to his friendliness and his extraordinary generosity. The only thing he loved more than his business was his family, Steve, Larry, Julia, Kathy, Mark, Amy, Carly, Jordanna, Brian, Lizzy, and his friends. His constant desire was to be a burden to no one.

Mr. Aronofsky said in a statement: ''As I talked more about the film with my collaborators at Fox, it became clear that the production of 'The Wolverine' would keep me out of the country for almost a year. I was not comfortable being away from my family for that length of time. I am sad that I won't be able to see the project through, as it is a terrific script and I was very much looking forward to working with my friend, Hugh Jackman, again.''"

Though the original ''120 Minutes'' was shown on MTV from 1986 to 2000 and had several hosts in that time, the show is most closely associated with the loquacious and enthusiastic Matt Pinfield, whose tenure ran from 1995 to 1999, and who will host the new monthly ''120 Minutes'' on MTV2 as well as an online companion series, ''120 Seconds,'' on the mtvhive.com Web site."

(ABC) SUPERNANNY In this 117th episode and series finale, Jo Frost, right, travels to Houston to work with the family of a woman who died of breast cancer a year earlier; Ms. Frost lost her own mother to that illness. ''To me, this is the end of the world,'' says Michael, 6, who is devastated by his mother's death and feels his memories of her slipping away. His father, Gary, is doing his best to raise Michael and his brothers, Sean, 4, and Dylan, 3, but is overwhelmed and can't bring himself to enforce the rules his wife established for the boys. Dylan still isn't potty trained, and he and his brothers prefer candy bars to healthy food. In her ultimate mission Ms. Frost tries to help this grieving family find peace. 8 P.M. (TCM) STARRING JEANNE MOREAU Intelligent and offbeat, sensuous and austere, Ms. Moreau was a favorite of the New Wave directors François Truffaut and Louis Malle, first rising to prominence in ''Elevator to the Gallows'' (1958) and ''The Lovers'' (1958). But it was her free-spirited performance as Catherine, a tempestuous beauty who comes between college friends (Henri Serre and Oskar Werner, from left above, with Ms. Moreau) in Truffaut's ''Jules and Jim'' (1962), that sealed her stardom. That film will be shown at 12:15 a.m. as part of a three-movie tribute to Ms. Moreau. The evening begins with William A. Fraker's ''Monte Walsh'' (1970), with Ms. Moreau as the mistress of an aging cowboy (Lee Marvin) in the 1880s Wild West. Malle's ''Viva Maria!'' (1965) follows at 10, with Ms. Moreau as Maria I and Brigitte Bardot as Maria II, traveling performers who invent the striptease in Central America in 1910 and end up involved in a revolution."

It also shows that their symbiotic relationship was seriously strained in the weeks between the inaugural on March 4 and the outbreak of war on April 12.

But auctions are where museums most often decide to sell works of art, because public sales are widely considered the most transparent method of deaccessioning. So when the doors to the annual European Fine Art Fair here opened for an invitation-only-preview on Thursday afternoon, one of the most talked-about paintings on view was ''Woman Picking Flowers,'' a Renoir from 1874-1875 that is being sold by the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. The canvas, which is hanging as a centerpiece at the booth of Dickinson, a London gallery, depicts Camille Monet, the first wife of Renoir's friend and colleague Claude Monet, standing in a field and holding a bunch of flowers. Sterling Clark bought the painting from Durand-Ruel, the Paris dealer, in 1933. But since the Clark owns 32 other works by the artist, it is selling this one--with a price tag of $15 million--to raise money for future acquisitions."

Warner Brothers Pictures announced on Thursday evening that Mr. Costner, the star of ''Field of Dreams,'' ''Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves'' and ''The Untouchables,'' will play Jonathan Kent, one of two human parents who take in the Kryptonian baby Kal-El and raise him as their son, Clark, in the new Superman movie being prepared by the director Zack Snyder (the ''Watchmen'' and ''Sucker Punch'' filmmaker). It was previously announced that Henry Cavill (of ''The Tudors) will play Superman and Diane Lanewill play Jonathan's wife, Martha. In previous incarnations, Jonathan Kent has been something of a tragic figure in Superman's life, having died of a heart attack in Richard Donner's 1978 ''Superman'' film, the CW television series ''Smallville'' and the recent Superman comics. (Whereas it only sometimes seems like Mr. Costner rode off into the sunset after winning a boatload of Oscars for ''Dances With Wolves.'')"

Elvis Presley Enterprises, the company that manages that rock legend's licensing, publishing and merchandising, is hoping it can entice you to create some Elvis-oriented art, in return for a shot at a Presley-themed prize package. To mark the 55 years since 1956, the fateful year when Presley released his single ''Heartbreak Hotel,'' his album ''Elvis Presley'' and his movie ''Love Me Tender,'' the company said in a news release that it is seeking a ''a work of art that symbolizes Elvis' revolution in 1956.'' Entries can be provided in just about any medium (which would seem to include velvet paintings) and must be submitted in .jpeg or .pdf format at Elvis.com/revolution by April 28.

Beginning in the Lindsay administration, she served the city in numerous capacities including: press secretary of the 1975 Charter Revision Commission, member of the 1992 Democratic Convention Host Committee; and member of the Taxi and Limousine Commission.

She joined the Foundation's board in 1984 and its staff in 1993, serving as President until 2009.

She played a particularly significant role in the reproductive rights field, leading funder groups and inspiring frontline organizations.

2011-03-20T00:00:00Z,"EastBefore Saturday's game between Connecticut and Cincinnati, no teams from the same conference had ever played each other in the Round of 32. On Sunday in Cleveland, it will happen again. Third-seeded SYRACUSE will take on a Big East foe, No. 11 MARQUETTE. The Orange relies on a 2-3 zone to confuse teams in the tournament. Will that strategy work against a team that sees it every year? Marquette beat Syracuse, 76-70, in their lone meeting this season. No. 8 GEORGE MASON was the higher-seeded team when it beat Villanova in its opener, but any time the Patriots win in the tournament, it makes fans think about upsets. It would be a monumental surprise if George Mason managed to topple No. 1 OHIO STATE, the No. 1 overall seed. No. 7 WASHINGTON is a long way from home in Charlotte, which won't make things any easier against No. 2 NORTH CAROLINA. WestThe last two games fifth-seeded ARIZONA has played have ended with the score 77-75. The Wildcats lost the first, in overtime to Washington in the Pac-10 tournament championship. The next, they won, against Memphis in their opening game in Tulsa, Okla. It remains to be seen what the score will be when Arizona plays No. 4 TEXAS. The Longhorns stumbled a bit at the end of the regular season, but Rick Barnes has his team on the brink of reaching the Round of 16 for the sixth time in 10 years. In Charlotte, N.C., top-seeded DUKE will renew a rivalry with No. 8 MICHIGAN.

2011-03-20T00:00:00Z,"Coming out of the Miu Miu show on the last day of the Paris collections, I had the feeling I was connecting again with ordinary life. Energized by the early spring weather, or maybe the thought of going home, everybody had lightened up, retracted their claws. I thought about going for a drink or a manicure. Instead I went to Eric Kayser, bought my umpteenth cafe au lait, and took it back to my hotel room and started a review. Around 8:30 p.m., I went to Azzedine Alaia's place in the Marais. This has become almost a ritual, the late-night, last-day stop at Mr. Alaia's to see what he has been making. He doesn't have shows anymore. Sometimes I wedge in a studio visit during the collections, just as I do with other designers, but this time the Galliano-Dior business had kept me busy. I think it wore everyone down in the end - the disgust, the disappointment, the blitz of stories. Things were out of control, though the unraveling hardly began with a drunken rant by a designer in a bar. Strange to say, but I think this feeling of the industry operating under extreme pressure, like a valve, will be the condition and not the exception."

2011-03-20T00:00:00Z,"The name of Samcheong-dong, one of Seoul's most rapidly evolving neighborhoods, means ''three pure things.'' Originally, that referred to clean water, beautiful mountains and good citizens. Today, though, it might as well stand for organic coffee bars, Italian restaurants and art galleries. For those who equate Seoul with a sprawling metropolis of skyscrapers and malls, the intimate scale of Samcheong-dong is a pleasant surprise. Much of this old-monied neighborhood, in the north of the city, is a hilltop maze of one-story hanoks, small traditional courtyard houses with pagoda-style black slate roofs. In recent years, some of those hanoks have become galleries, Italian- and American-style cafes and wine bars. The latest word is that the Korean National Museum of Contemporary Art will open a satellite in 2013 in the area."

A proud daughter of Chicago, she embraced her adopted home of New York with characteristic passion and energy. Beginning in the Lindsay administration, she served the city in numerous capacities including: press secretary of the 1975 Charter Revision Commission, member of the 1992 Democratic Convention Host Committee; and member of the Taxi and Limousine Commission. In addition to a distinguished career in public relations (M. Booth, Soref and Silverman, etc.) she was the founding executive director of the Citizens Committee of New York City, the city's leader in supporting block associations and neighborhood revitalization. She joined the Foundation's board in 1984 and its staff in 1993, serving as President until 2009. Her dedicated and dynamic leadership increased both the effectiveness of our giving and the visibility of the Foundation. She played a particularly significant role in the reproductive rights field, leading funder groups and inspiring frontline organizations. Meetings with grantees were defined by her generosity and warmth, as well as her genuine curiosity. She loved politics, she loved do-gooders, and she deeply loved her colleagues and her gang of friends, who will all desperately miss her warmth and intelligence. We extend our love and condolences to her brother Marvin and sister-in-law Barbara of Jerusalem as well her many nieces, nephews and other family members whom she loved so much."

Now, his critically neglected oeuvre is receiving some attention, with a new monograph and show at Artists Space, at 38 Greene Street.

Rock crystals and diamonds are organically incorporated into the designs, using techniques employed by the Mughal Empire of Jaipur, India. ""Gold embraces a gemstone and assumes its form,"" says von Furstenberg of eye-catching pieces like the undulating teardrop crystal rings. ""The movement within the gold alludes to sensuality and natural feminine forms."" Inspirational inscriptions, like love, laughter, harmony and freedom, are engraved on the back of each pendant, earring droplet and ring, a tribute to the power von Furstenberg sees in both words and gold. (Prices range from $3,200 to $8,200). ""The combination not only adds beauty, but strength and empowerment as well,"" she explains. Indeed, the collection displays a majestic embodiment of the literal translation of ""sutra"" from Sanskrit: a line that holds objects together."

Instead, these candidates and nominees come from the most populous counties-in numbers significantly out of proportion to these counties' share of their state population. Gimpel, Lee and Thorpe argue that dense population fosters political ambition and provides candidates with the resources they need to pursue their ambition. The upshot is that rural areas are under-represented in state governments."

(13) NO TOMORROW (2011) In May 2005 PBS broadcast the documentary ''Aging Out,'' directed by Roger Weisberg and Vanessa Roth, about the challenges facing older teenagers who were forced to leave the foster care system and learn to fend for themselves. One subject was Risa Bejarano, above, who was abused and molested as a child and shuttled among foster homes in Los Angeles for six years. After becoming the first member of her family to graduate from high school and receiving scholarships for college, she eventually found herself battling drug addiction. By June 2004 she was living on the street. That month she was fatally shot by Juan Jose Chavez, who wanted to prevent her from talking to the police about two gang killings she might have witnessed. He was ultimately sentenced to death. In this new documentary Mr. Weisberg and Ms. Roth follow up on Ms. Bejarano's murder and the unexpected role that ''Aging Out'' played in the trial of her killer. 8 P.M.

(There were hints of a similar critique from Adam Serwer and Andrew Sullivan as well.) This was not my intention at all: As I've suggested before, I think that the Iraq War was a mistake in its conception and a botch in its execution, and I wouldn't be supportive of our Libya intervention if it were being undertaken à la Rumsfeld (or John Bolton) rather than à la Samantha Power. My point, rather, was to push back against the conceit that the form of a war can vindicate its strategy - that what matters most in warfare is whether you're ""part of U.N. Security Council approved action"" and whether the Arab League gives you the go-ahead, and that merely invoking the Obama White House's multilateralism is sufficient to prove that our Libyan venture is far more responsible than the invasion of Iraq. Too many liberal Libya hawks (the president included) seem bent on persuading themselves that a strategically dubious intervention is justified so long as its goals are sufficiently high-minded and the French and the United Nations are on board. But the history of such interventions doesn't bear their logic out."

With the victory, the seniors finished their careers with a record of 63-0 at Maples Pavilion. It was the first meeting between the teams, but the Cardinal, seeded No. 1 in the Spokane Region, had seen the St. John's type before: a young, hungry, scrappy squad playing as if it had nothing to lose. Four years ago, Florida State upset the Cardinal at Maples in a second-round game, a result that no doubt flashed before the eyes of the Cardinal faithful when the ninth-seeded Red Storm (22-11) jumped out to a 22-14 lead after 10 minutes 15 seconds."

The decision, handed down on Friday by Judge Deborah A. Batts, found in favor of Patrick Cariou, a photographer whose book ''Yes Rasta,'' featuring portraits he took during several months in Jamaica, was published in 2000. According to the suit, Mr. Prince used 41 or more of the pictures from the book as the basis for a body of work he called ''Canal Zone,'' which was shown in St. Barts and in a 2008 exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea. A gallery that was planning to show Mr. Cariou's photographs canceled that exhibition after learning that Mr. Prince had already created works based on the photographs."

The rationale seems to be that some other entity, in this case the paper, might be making some unauthorized money by appropriating a brand that belongs to someone else, in this case the team's owner, Daniel Snyder. No doubt he has the right to do so, but does that mean he's right to do so? Is it a smart business decision? You'd think that such vigorous policing of a brand's use in a case like this would threaten to make the brand less appealing to the fans who make that brand valuable in the first place. Apparently not. Snyder has a history of antagonisms - start here, then check out his current lawsuit against The Washington City Paper - and still his is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the world."

Mr. Pritchett served in World War II where he earned a degree in meteorology. He met his wife Cynthia as they starred together in a production of ""Guys and Dolls"" in her home state of Michigan.

On Tuesday, the first day of release for his new album, ''F.A.M.E.,'' Mr. Brown reportedly left behind a dressing room strewn with broken glass at ABC's ''Good Morning America'' after giving an uncomfortable interview to the ''G.M.A.'' co-anchor Robin Roberts. In the interview, Ms. Roberts asked Mr. Brown about a 2009 incident involving his ex-companion, the pop singer Rihanna, after which Mr. Brown pleaded guilty to a charge of felonious assault and was sentenced to five years of probation and six months of community labor. After Mr. Brown said that a restraining order against him had recently been relaxed, Ms. Roberts asked if he and Rihanna still saw each other; Mr. Brown replied, ''I mean, not really,'' and he avoided follow-up questions. Mr. Brown then performed a song from his new album and returned to his dressing room, where the ''G.M.A.'' morning staff members said they heard loud noises that prompted a call to security, according to a report on the ABC News Web site. It was later found that a window in the dressing room had been broken, leaving glass in the room and on the street outside ABC's studio in Times Square, and that Mr. Brown and his representatives had left the building. ABC declined to comment on the incident, beyond a statement from ABC News that said, ''As always, we ask questions that are relevant and newsworthy, and that's what we did in this interview with Mr. Brown.'' A telephone call to Jive Records, which released ''F.A.M.E.,'' went unanswered on Tuesday afternoon."

It surely has appeal also for the legions interested in the dynamic history of New York neighborhoods. Trees still grow in Williamsburg, of course, though now you are more likely to hear about the birth of boutiques with exposed brick. But the problem is that this is an awfully challenging musical to mount: a mix of peppy, melting-pot comedy and pitch-black tragedy, with a large cast. Like so many adaptations of novels, the show, which had its premiere in 1951, moves very quickly through time and plot. To make sense of this sprawling work, you need a firm hand."

''All my friends can see everything we're talking about,'' she wrote us via e-mail. ''I don't want them to even know I'm doing this. We need to go back to e-mail.'' You don't. Facebook has a privacy setting for groups that allows you to hide not only the group's activity, but its very existence. To set it, you need to be configured as an admin for the group. By default, the only admin for a group is the Facebook member who created it."

2011-03-24T00:00:00Z,"In the age of YouTube, Pandora and Spotify, fans can watch millions of videos or listen to endless hours of music for free. But do those services make significant money for artists and record companies? Those questions became all the more interesting last week with ''Friday,'' a song by Rebecca Black, a 13-year-old amateur from California whose YouTube video became a viral sensation. With heavily Auto-Tuned vocals and lines like ''Tomorrow is Saturday/And Sunday comes afterwards,'' critics abhorred it. Yet it had racked up more than 38.5 million views by Wednesday afternoon, and the single was slowly climbing iTunes's posted popularity charts. What does all of that attention mean in dollars and cents? Forbes jumped in quickly, estimating that the song had generated ''a few hundred thousand downloads'' and would earn Ms. Black millions. But music industry number-crunchers soon threw cold water on that assessment. Billboard, triangulating through the song's iTunes chart position, guessed that it had less than 40,000 downloads; adding in possible revenue from YouTube, and adjusting for royalties, it yielded a back-of-the-envelope total of about $40,000 for the week. ''The start of a great college fund,'' Billboard said, but not mega-millions. But if there is money earned, who keeps it is unclear. Ark Music Factory, the company that produced the songs -- the company specializes in ready-to-made pop songs for tweens, with parental payment made up front -- did not respond to a request for comment."

2011-03-24T00:00:00Z,"On Thursday, the mad scramble that is the opening week of the N.C.A.A. tournament makes way for a more orderly Round of 16: eight games in two nights to whittle the field to eight teams. But don't be fooled. There is plenty of opportunity for the unexpected. While spunky underdogs often face up to the reality that they are out of their depth in this round, teams with bushels of talent can ill afford to be caught looking ahead. WestThe Round of 16 is new territory for second-seeded San Diego State, but it is a trip down memory lane for Coach Steve Fisher. He led Michigan to the 1989 national championship as an interim coach and later returned to the Final Four twice with the Fab Five. Standing in the Aztecs' way in Anaheim, Calif., is No. 3 Connecticut. The Huskies have spent the past two weeks defying expectations. They won an unprecedented five games in five days to win the Big East tournament, then dismissed any thoughts that they would be tired from that feat by winning their first two games of the N.C.A.A. tournament. Their reward? They get to fly across the country to face a team that has lost twice this season."

2011-03-24T00:00:00Z,"TAYLOR--Elizabeth. amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, mourns the loss of its Founding International Chairman and cherished friend, Dame Elizabeth Taylor. As one of the earliest and most passionate advocates for people living with HIV/AIDS, Dame Elizabeth drew worldwide attention to the epidemic and helped raise millions of dollars for AIDS research. Spurred by anger at official inaction, undeterred by the stigma attached to AIDS, and above all motivated by her boundless compassion for those who were suffering, she did more in the early years of the epidemic than any other prominent figure to change the world's view of AIDS and those affected by it. Much of Dame Elizabeth's early work with amfAR involved speaking out about the realities of HIV/AIDS and lobbying aggressively for increased federal funds for research, education, treatment, and care. ""I will not be silenced and I will not give up and I will not be ignored,"" she once declared, and her determination brought hope to millions. Whether she was visiting patients in the hospital, headlining an amfAR benefit, or addressing the United Nations on the need for worldwide action, Dame Elizabeth always impressed those around her with her grace, dignity, and intelligence. For more than two decades she remained an active and visible leader in the fight against AIDS, chairing many of amfAR's successful Cinema Against AIDS benefits. While we grieve her passing, the board of trustees and staff of amfAR will remember and honor Elizabeth Taylor for inspiring us to continue working for an end to this devastating epidemic. We extend our deepest sympathy to Dame Elizabeth's family. Kenneth Cole, Chairman of the Board Mathilde Krim, Ph.D., Founding Chairman Kevin Robert Frost, CEO amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research"

The writer Wells Tower also takes a timely journey, this one through Humboldt County, the cannabis-growing hub of California (much in the news recently) with a lovably cantankerous local culture and an impossibly gorgeous landscape. Nature is also the lure in Newfoundland, Canada, which, as Mark Schatzker learns, is perhaps the best place to catch and eat a wild Atlantic salmon, a fish most of us have only eaten farmed. Elsewhere in the issue are more cerebral pleasures, as in Trieste, a legendary Italian redoubt for thinkers and flâneurs, and Beirut, Lebanon, where Joumana Haddad is creating a stir with her erotic writing - as well as plenty of sybaritic pursuits: a luxurious new boot-camp spa in Laguna, Calif.; a revived, post-recession London filled with new restaurants, shops and bars; and a lively music scene revolves around the beer halls and nightclubs of Hamburg, Germany, a playground forever enshrined by the Beatles."

The letters were in the hands of Laura Ciechomska, a grandniece of Chopin, until at least 1939, a museum curator, Alicja Knast, said, according to The Associated Press.

He was 36, broke, blocked, disconsolate and sickly, a saturnine man contemplating his fears and failures. Perhaps the princess had business elsewhere; perhaps she understood a poet's need for solitude; perhaps he was merely bad company. In any case, she left the castle, while Rilke remained, watched over by a staff who must have found him odd, at best. It was January, and Trieste's furious Bora wind was blowing; nevertheless, he liked to walk along the cliffs overlooking the Adriatic. On one such occasion, he was brooding about money, as writers will, when his thoughts were interrupted by a voice emerging from the gale: ""Who, if I cried, would hear me among the Dominions of Angels?"""

2011-03-25T10:45:17Z,"The Times's Bucks blog is hosting a timely discussion on the merits of taking on student loan debt for a four-year college versus paying the relatively inexpensive tuition of community college, perhaps with an eye on transferring later. As its jumping-off point, the blog post uses an article about ""an 18-year-old high school senior with a choice to make. Should he go into at least $6,500 in debt each year to attend a private college or university like Juniata or Clark, or is he better off working part time and attending community college for two years before transferring to one of those colleges?"""

A screening at MoMA of ""Hit So Hard,"" directed by P. David Ebersole, is set to be visited by its subject, Ms. Schemel, as well as the guitarist Eric Erlandson and the bassist Melissa Auf der Maur, not to mention a certain idiosyncratic front woman and fashion plate named Courtney Love. If we sound a little surprised by the gathering (which the film series organizers say is the first time these four musicians have been together at a public event in 13 years), consider such past events in the history of Hole as: Ms. Schemel's departure from the group in 1998 and the band's dissolution in 2002; Ms. Love's announcement of a Hole reunion in 2009 that seemed to surprise Ms. Auf der Mar; Mr. Erlandson's remarks that ""there is no Hole without me"" and Ms. Love's online reply that Hole is ""MY Band"" and ""MY name."" A Q. and A. with Mr. Ebersole and the band members is set to follow the screening; there was no mention of whether it would be conducted from within a steel cage."

The second, ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,"" created by Aaron Sorkin, was an hour-long drama about philosophical and aesthetic debates, the pioneering satire of Gilbert and Sullivan and, somehow, the delicacy of hostage negotiations during wartime.

2011-03-25T07:13:04Z,"The imperiled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan dates from the 1960s. Forty-plus years may not be a long time when it comes to radioactive decay - 300 years to go for the Switzerland-size contaminated area around Chernobyl - but it can feel like close to forever when you think about the engineering and technological advances since the pre-moon-landing days. Steven Chu, the secretary of energy, says that the 23 American reactors (more than 20 percent of our reactor fleet, by the way) built according to the same design as the Fukushima Daiichi station are continually ""upgraded"" to ensure their safety. But still. As one of our contributing writers, Jon Gertner, put it a few years ago, ""Nuclear power plants are arguably the most complicated machines in the history of civilization."" Even as that partly hints at why their failures can be so catastrophic, it also prompts the question: Shouldn't we have more than upgrades by now? Shouldn't we have much more advanced nuclear ""machines"" already?"

2011-03-25T06:00:51Z,"Whereas my colleague Jeff Erickson recently ranked closers, I'd like to take a step further and look over relievers who could end up factoring in your league's save category this season. Closers-in-waiting have become increasingly overpriced in recent years, which is a mistake, given how volatile relief pitching is year-to-year. Nevertheless, 20 to 30 percent of a typical fantasy league's saves during the season come off the waiver wire, so this aspect can't be ignored. Just let your own league dictate which middle relievers to grab. I'm not ranking the following for a reason - all are similar, so you might as well take those who come cheapest."

Born in Irvington, NJ on June 24, 1920, Mr. Faupel graduated from Irvington High School in 1937. At the outbreak of WWII, he enlisted in the Army Air Force and served in Intelligence for the 8th Air Force, earning a Bronze Star, a Presidential Citation (Division Award) and three campaign ribbons. Returning from the war in 1945, he went to work at P. Ballantine & Sons Brewery in Newark. There, Len fell in love with and married Jacqueline Kuett in 1947. The couple settled in Maplewood, NJ. Mr. Faupel's professional career in marketing and advertising spanned 40 years. At Ballantine, Len became Advertising and Public Relations Director. He oversaw Ballantine's sponsorship of the Yankees and football Giants, and helped pioneer the explosive growth of televised sporting events we take for granted today. From Ballantine, Mr. Faupel was hired as Senior Vice President at William Esty Co. in New York City. His creative talents promoted brands including Mastercard, Seagram, Colgate, Genesee Beer and SAS Airlines. Len was a dedicated family man and community servant. He chaired the Maplewood Recreation Committee for ten years and was President of the Maplewood Little Club. After retiring in 1985, Mr. Faupel moved with Jacqueline to Sea Girt where he served on the Planning Board. An avid craftsman, he and Mrs. Faupel built two homes in Sea Girt. Active and engaged all his life, Mr. Faupel directed considerable time and energy to organizations dedicated to special needs individuals; in particular, the Bancroft School, where he was a member of the Board of Trustees, Chair of the Board of Rehabilitation Services, and a member of several other boards. In recent years, Len served as a board member of Plan/New Jersey, an organization whose mission is to ensure lifetime good care for individuals with special needs. In addition to his beloved wife, Jacqueline, Len is survived by sons Mark and John, daughter Caroline Keating, granddaughters Erinn and Jessica, grandsons Matthew Devlin and Sean, sister Nancy Benner and family, and many more beloved extended family members and treasured friends.

Scott wrote in The New York Times that the movie was ''the finest post-Zionist action-hairdressing sex comedy I have ever seen. That it is the only one I have ever seen -- and why is that? what cultural deficiency or ideological conspiracy has prevented this genre from flourishing? -- does not much detract from my judgment.'' NOON (13) RICHARD HEFFNER'S OPEN MIND David Owen, the former British foreign secretary and a physician, discusses the ''hubris syndrome'' in world leaders, past and present, and the theory that it might be an acquired personality disorder. He also recalls what Lord Acton famously wrote in an 1887 letter: ''Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.''"

2011-03-26T00:00:00Z,"Cast members of ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark'' held their first organized reading on Friday of the Broadway musical's new script, which jettisons the directorJulie Taymor's Geek Chorus of narrators and reduces her villainess Arachne to a supporting character, according to two members of the production who attended the reading. The new script beefs up the role of another villain, the Green Goblin (near right, played by Patrick Page, battling Reeve Carney as Peter Parker/Spider-Man), who proved popular with focus groups that the producers convened after the onslaught of negative reviews by theater critics. Most of the changes will be implemented during the show's hiatus, which starts April 19, according to the two production members, who would only speak anonymously because the producers do not want the changes discussed publicly. On Thursday, the producers said that the choreographer Chase Brock would stage new musical numbers. Mr. Brock, 27, is best known for his choreography on a popular video game, the Broadway Experience. He takes over from Daniel Ezralow. The producers ousted Ms. Taymor this month; Mr. Ezralow said at the time that he was directly assured that he would continue with the show. Ben Brantley, the chief theater critic of The New York Times, wrote in February that the musical may ''rank among the worst'' in Broadway history and that Mr. Ezralow's choreography was ''pure vintage MTV.''"
