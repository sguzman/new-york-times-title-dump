2014-02-09T00:00:00Z,"LOCKSLEY--Gordon, private art dealer, contemporary art collector and bon vivant, passed away quietly in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on February 1, 2014. He was 84. Mr. Locksley is remembered for his keen wit and wry sense of humor, his thoughtful generosity and devotion to friends, family and the art world. He is survived by his spouse, Wayne Boeck and long time partner George Shea. Mr. Locksley was born in Chicago, Illinois on August 27, 1930 to Sheila and William Locksley (Lukowitz). Gordon's father worked in pharmaceutical sales for Max Factor and instilled a love of fragrances and their histories in his young son. His grandparents, Isadore and Ella Lukowitz, came from Poland, emigrating before World War II and were renowned for their bakery, which provided Chicago residents with their famous onion rye bread. As a teenager, Gordon developed a love of opera, through weekly radio programs and later, a passion for Broadway musicals. Surrounded by his mother and aunts, Gordon was tutored in the art of cooking and acquired a passion for fine dining and entertaining, which lasted throughout his life. As a young man, Mr. Locksley lived briefly in Columbus, Ohio and then moved to Minneapolis, where he arrived on a bus in a snowstorm, wrapped in an opera cape.and in 1954 met Dr. George Shea, a professor of Japanese language and literature at the University of Minnesota. Together they opened the Red Carpet Beauty Salon and College, where Gordon styled hair, and where he eventually began selling art, first on the salon walls and then in a private space which came to be known as Locksley Shea Gallery, one of the leading spaces for contemporary art in Minneapolis, in the 1960s and 70s. The Locksley Shea Gallery hosted exhibitions by many of the leading names in contemporary art; Christo, Andy Warhol, Donald Judd, Brice Marden, Ellsworth Kelly and Robert Rauschenberg all came for the opening night party of their exhibitions. Legendary parties; Christo wrapped two nude models in cellophane one night, Warhol and his entourage arrived by limousine, there were outrageous costume parties with live bands, multiple bars, dancing and gogo dancers. Gordon was a partner in Sutton Place, the first gay bar in Minneapolis. He and his attorney, Elliot Kaplan, worked tirelessly with local licensing authorities and the city council to create higher visibility for gay rights and equality. In 1974, following a downturn in the art market, a historic snowstorm and a notably large piece of business, Gordon and George Shea departed Minneapolis for Rome, Cannes and Paris where they lived until 1994, when they returned to the US and settled into an A. Quincy Jones designed estate, which was featured in the movie ""Oceans Eleven,"" in Palm Springs. In 1998, Mr. Locksley met Wayne Boeck and moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where they were married in November 2013. Selections from the Locksley Shea Art Collection are currently on view at the Minneapolis Art Institute. Mr. Locksley's ashes will be scattered on the mountainside above Palm Springs, California. There will be no memorial service."

2014-02-09T00:00:00Z,"HIRSCH--Shay Yandell. June 8, 1947 to February 3, 2014. A beloved mother, wife, grandmother, social worker, friend, marathon runner, skier, writer, advocate, hiker, traveler, defender of the vulnerable and cancer warrior, passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by family, on February 3rd. Shay grew up in Boise, Idaho, where she was a 1965 graduate of Boise High School. Her childhood in the American West sparked a lasting love of nature. She entered a career in social work after graduating from Whitman College in 1969, and she devoted her life to others. In 1973, she married Greg Scrivner; the couple's two sons, Ian and Sean, were born in Alaska. After living in France, Ireland, Colombia, and New Jersey, Shay returned to Boise, where she became the director of YWCA's shelter for battered women, now called the Women's and Children's Alliance. At the 1988 New Jersey Waterfront Marathon, George Hirsch, who had met Shay only the day before at a marathon expo, and who was irrevocably lovestruck, ran through the crowded field of a race for which he had not registered until he found her. They ran the remaining 21 miles together, and they married the next year. Shay relocated to New York City, but the Hirsches maintained strong ties to Idaho, and they kept a home in Sun Valley. For the past eleven years, Shay wrote eloquently of her fight against multiple myeloma, an incurable blood cancer. Through two stem cell transplants and through more recent encounters with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, Shay faced wave after wave of indignities with dignity and grace. She ended each post about her cancer battle by saying ""Onward!"" She embraced every part of life as an adventure, even the difficult ones. The impact of Shay's life is ""incalculably diffusive,"" as George Eliot once wrote. Shay's memory will be held closely in the hearts of her husband, George A. Hirsch, the chairman of the New York Road Runners; her son Ian Scrivner and spouse Cinzia Dinoi; her son Sean Scrivner and partner Rachel Teannalach; her stepsons David and William Hirsch; her father Robert Yandell, brother Robert Yandell, and brother John Yandell and spouse Julie Yandell; her grandchildren Anjali Hirsch and Rhys Scrivner; and her nephews Christopher and Nicholas Yandell. A celebration of Shay's life will be held in March."

2014-02-09T00:00:00Z,"CRARYHorace Ingraham, passed away peacefully in his home on February 7, 2014 at the age of 89. A resident of New Canaan for the past 58 years, he was President and co-founder, with Dr. David S. Brown, of the New Canaan Medical Group. From their initial partnership, the Group grew to include 11 physicians and a medical lab at the time of his retirement. House calls were made at all hours of the night and on weekends and were an important part of the practice. Born in Brooklyn, NY in 1924 to Miner D. Crary and Edith Ingraham Crary, he was the last surviving grandchild of Jerry, a Civil War veteran, and Antoinette Crary. He was raised in Warren, PA and their family home on Duck Island, in Northport, NY. He graduated from Deerfield Academy and received a B.A. from Amherst College in 1946. During World War II, and while at Amherst, he entered the Navy reserve, which included a year at Williams College as part of the wartime accelerated program. He obtained his Doctor of Medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, interned at Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, NY and did his residency at Rhode Island Hospital. His training was interrupted by the Korean War, during which time he served in Portland, OR as a Captain in the U.S. Air Force. Following military service, he completed his training with a cardiology fellowship at Johns Hopkins, before starting an internal medicine practice in New Canaan, CT. Horace was active in the medical community. He was the last volunteer Chief of Medicine at Norwalk Hospital and was instrumental in the founding of Waveny Care Center and was a member of its Board of Directors. In addition, he was chairman of the Medical Advisory Committee at the Visiting Nurse Association. He was also active in retirement, serving as President of the Greenwich Research Partners, a local investment club, and was a board member of the Senior Men's Club. His financial skills and interest in investments defied the common doctor stereotype. Being an avid athlete, he won tennis and squash tournaments in college and after, fly fished for salmon and took up paddle boarding in his 80's. In his later years golf became his passion. He had three hole-in-ones. He was predeceased by his loving wife of 61 years, Arline G. Crary, his brother Miner D. Crary, Jr. and his sister Winifred A. Valens. He is survived by his four children: Jane, Horace, Jr. and his wife Susan, Dianne and Robert, three grandchildren: Gardner, Nicholas and Ian, as well as his dear friend Margaret M. Campbell. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and former patients. Services will be held at 11am on February 13th at St. Marks Church in New Canaan, CT. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to Visiting Nurse and Hospice of Fairfield County (www.visitingnurse.net) or Waveny Care Center (www.Waveny.org)."
2014-02-09T00:00:00Z,"BONHEUR--Hooshang, PhD, of New York, passed away on January 29, 2014 with his family by his side. He was a man who had a lifelong passion for learning and stood by his principles with conviction and without fail. He had a gentle warmth that could easily be heard in his voice, felt in his touch and seen in his smile. An accomplished clinical psychologist, he dedicated his professional career to his work as a forensic psychologist at the Supreme Court of the City of New York. Most important to him, he was a devoted and loving father to Jennifer and Craig, an adored grandfather to David and Adam, a cherished brother, uncle, cousin and friend. He was the man who taught us to ""always do what you know and feel to be right"" and emphasized how important it is to ""make sure you leave this world a little better than how you found it"". He most certainly did just that. His legacy will live on in all who knew him. Thank you Baba Hooshie, for enriching our lives every day and for being the man you'll forever be in our hearts."

She grew up in Cambridge, and graduated from the Buckingham School '47 and Radcliffe College '51. Violinist, violist, teacher, conductor--classical music filled her life. During summers in Woods Hole she co-directed Gilbert and Sullivan operettas and conducted the Woods Hole Cantata Consort. Even as her health failed, she played quartets and attended music camps. Arguably, her greatest talent was making world-class 1:12 scale violins from rare woods and eye surgical thread, each outfitted with functioning tuning pegs and a tiny label bearing her name painted with a one-hair brush. Liz lived at the center of a rich social world, and many people thought of her as a second mother. The daughter and wife of renowned scientists, she maintained deep ties to the scientific community. Outspoken and widely read, she was also a fierce critic of the anti-science movement. Married to Bernard D. Davis (d. 1994), daughter of Donald H. and Florence K. Menzel, she is survived by sons Franklin and Jonathan of Newton, MA, daughter Kate of New York City, sister Suzanne Lindeman Snyder of Austin, TX, and six grandchildren, Juliet and Jonah Ryan-Davis, Jeremiah and Rowan Davis, and Quentin and Katrina Heilbroner.

2014-02-10T00:00:00Z,"CRARYHorace Ingraham, passed away peacefully in his home on February 7, 2014 at the age of 89. A resident of New Canaan for the past 58 years, he was President and co-founder, with Dr. David S. Brown, of the New Canaan Medical Group. From their initial partnership, the Group grew to include 11 physicians and a medical lab at the time of his retirement. House calls were made at all hours of the night and on weekends and were an important part of the practice. Born in Brooklyn, NY in 1924 to Miner D. Crary and Edith Ingraham Crary, he was the last surviving grandchild of Jerry, a Civil War veteran, and Antoinette Crary. He was raised in Warren, PA and their family home on Duck Island, in Northport, NY. He graduated from Deerfield Academy and received a B.A. from Amherst College in 1946. During World War II, and while at Amherst, he entered the Navy reserve, which included a year at Williams College as part of the wartime accelerated program. He obtained his Doctor of Medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, interned at Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, NY and did his residency at Rhode Island Hospital. His training was interrupted by the Korean War, during which time he served in Portland, OR as a Captain in the U.S. Air Force. Following military service, he completed his training with a cardiology fellowship at Johns Hopkins, before starting an internal medicine practice in New Canaan, CT. Horace was active in the medical community. He was the last volunteer Chief of Medicine at Norwalk Hospital and was instrumental in the founding of Waveny Care Center and was a member of its Board of Directors. In addition, he was chairman of the Medical Advisory Committee at the Visiting Nurse Association. He was also active in retirement, serving as President of the Greenwich Research Partners, a local investment club, and was a board member of the Senior Men's Club. His financial skills and interest in investments defied the common doctor stereotype. Being an avid athlete, he won tennis and squash tournaments in college and after, fly fished for salmon and took up paddle boarding in his 80's. In his later years golf became his passion. He had three hole-in-ones. He was predeceased by his loving wife of 61 years, Arline G. Crary, his brother Miner D. Crary, Jr. and his sister Winifred A. Valens. He is survived by his four children: Jane, Horace, Jr. and his wife Susan, Dianne and Robert, three grandchildren: Gardner, Nicholas and Ian, as well as his dear friend Margaret M. Campbell. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and former patients. Services will be held at 11am on February 13th at St. Marks Church in New Canaan, CT.

Most of all he loved spending time with his family, including attending annual family reunions. He was also extremely proud of establishing with Goldie the Goldie Brenner Swartz and Howard Swartz Scholarship Fund at SUNY Albany which provides scholarship assistance to disabled students, primarily to students with vision impairments. The scholarship has assisted many students who would otherwise have been unable to complete their undergraduate studies. The scholarship has provided a dozen students in the last six years the opportunity to complete their undergraduate studies.

He is survived by his son Mark and wife Iris of New City, NY, son Barry and wife Karen of Clarence, NY, grandsons Michael Swartz, Adam Swartz (and wife Melissa) and Jonathan Campbell (and wife Jenna), and many cousins, nieces, nephews and friends.

It's hard to sum up a life in two words, but if you could, for Cathy, it would be: strong heart. Cathy was an influential practitioner of the Alexander Technique whose diverse array of students included members of the Metropolitan Opera, players for the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team and important figures in contemporary jazz. Before receiving her multiple professional accolades in her field (including a Master's Degree in Kinesiology), Cathy was a dancer. She would often tell strangers, ""I was a dancer, you know,"" as if her graceful movements and radiant beauty weren't proof enough. For the last seven years of her life, Cathy was also admired for what she called ""dancing my way through cancer."" Having received a 6-months-to-live diagnosis nearly a decade ago, Cathy fought valiantly and beautifully and inspired countless patients, nurses and doctors to keep dancing. She died on her birthday. Like Moses. Cathy is survived by her two loving children Lukas Kaiser and Marissa Kaiser, as well as an insurmountable number of extended family and friends, colleagues and students who will feel her loss forever. Please send condolences to 344 Mill Road, Valley Stream, NY 11581."

2014-02-12T00:00:00Z,"MUSE--Martha Twitchell. The board and staff of the Tinker Foundation Incorporated mourn the passing of its former Chairman and President, Martha T. Muse. She died on Sunday, February 9th, in Stuart, Florida after a brief illness. Martha was born in Dallas, Texas in 1926, the daughter of John Blackburn Muse and Kathryn Poole Burbank, but lived in New York City for most of her life. She maintained residences in New York City, Connecticut and Florida. Her principal interests focused on Latin America, but she contributed substantially to educational, corporate and non-profit areas. Martha was a founding director of the Tinker Foundation. She served as its president for 27 years and its chairman for 33 years, retiring in 2008. It was under her direction that the Foundation became a leading funder of Latin American-related activities providing support for educational, environmental, security, economic, legal and governance issues. Martha received her undergraduate degree from Barnard College in 1948 and a master's degree in political science from Columbia University in 1955. In 1981 she received an honorary doctorate from Georgetown University. She was the first woman elected as a trustee to Columbia University and was among the first women named to the Board of the New York Stock Exchange and the Council on Foreign Relations. She served on numerous corporate boards including The Bank of New York, May Department Stores, Sterling Drug Inc., ASARCO, ACF Industries and Associated Dry Goods. Her non-profit boards included the Americas Society, the Spanish Institute, and the Luso-American Development Foundation. For her many contributions to the field of Latin American relations she received numerous awards: Orden del Sol del Peru, Order of Bernardo O'Higgins (Chile), Order de Mayo al Merito (Argentina); Ordem Nacional do Cruzeiro do Sul (Brazil), and awards from the Spanish Institute and the Americas Society. She was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Colony Club, the Huguenot Society and the National Society of Colonial Dames. One of her final directives to the Tinker Foundation was incorporating Antarctica-related subjects under its funding mandate. Her support of Antarctica was recognized in 2009 by the establishment of the Muse Prize for Science and Policy in Antarctica, an award for mid-career Antarctic scientists and policy makers. A memorial service will be held in New York City in the late spring. Letters of inquiry and condolence may be sent to the Tinker Foundation, 55 E. 59th St., New York, NY 10022."
2014-02-12T00:00:00Z,"DAWSON--Mary P. Passed away peacefully on February 8th, 2014 in Manhattan at the age of 89. Perpetually warm and gregarious, she spent her final days in the loving company of family and dear friends. Mary leaves behind an everlasting legacy of faith, compassion, love and selflessness that will continue to live in the hearts of those who hold her dear. She lived a meaningful and full life, at the center of which was her beloved family and countless friends. Of her friendships, many were old and dear; but, new ones were always being forged - few were impervious to her boundless charm. A woman of admirable spirit and energy, Mary will be remembered as a loving, dedicated and often whimsical mother, grandmother, great grandmother and cherished friend. Born in New York City, Mary was raised in Hollywood, CA and lived in Illinois, Oklahoma, and Washington, before raising her own family in Winter Park, FL. A strong and loving woman, Mary's dedication to her family was unwavering - she was an extraordinary caregiver to her mother and in turn, an outstanding mother to her children. In addition to family life, she also led a distinguished banking career, becoming one of the first female Vice Presidents of a Central Florida bank before retiring and returning to New York City. Incredibly well-read and an avid lover of music and the arts, Mary remained active in her later years. She dedicated her time to volunteer work at the Morgan Library and the Richard Tucker Music Foundation in addition to playing the occasional ""Mary Poppins"" to her grandchildren. She was predeceased by her husband Lt. Colonel William Dawson; survived by her two children and their spouses, Linda Sachs (and her husband, Michael), and Rodney Dawson (and his wife, Janet); her five grandchildren, Blake (and her husband, John Paul), Courtney and Steven Sachs, and John (and his wife, Christina) and David (and his wife, Shannon) Dawson (and their mother, Barbara); and four great-grandchildren, Cole, Dillon, Brody and Naomi Dawson.

Friends are invited to a Viewing with the family from 12:30 to 1:30pm immediately followed by a Memorial Service on Thursday, February 13th at the Church of St. Thomas More, 65 E 89th Street in Manhattan.

2014-02-12T00:00:00Z,"ZUBAY--Geoffrey Louis. Professor Geoffrey Louis Zubay, who pioneered early studies on gene expression after the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA and genetic code, died on February 5 in West Palm Beach, FL, where he and his wife resided since 2011. He was 82 years old. The cause of death was cardiac arrest. Born in Chicago November 15, 1931, Dr. Zubay had a very precocious youth and graduated from the University of Chicago with an A.B. in Philosophy at the age of seventeen. He received an M.A. in Physical Chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1952, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1957. He completed three years of post-doctoral study at Kings College of the University of London, and the Rockefeller Institute in New York. Dr. Zubay then established his own lab at the Biology Department of Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island in 1961. Three years later Dr. Zubay was recruited to Columbia University where he remained for 41 years. During his tenure at Columbia, Dr. Zubay's lab became renowned for the development of several cell-free systems for examining the expression of genes. This was during a time of great interest in gene expression following elucidation of the structure of DNA and genetic code. In addition to a long distinguished scientific research that included more than 160 publications, Dr. Zubay wrote a widely employed textbook in Biochemistry that survived four editions. He also wrote a Genetics textbook published in 1987. In his later career, his research interests shifted to the origins of life and prebiotic chemistry. This direction led to another text Origins of Life on the Earth and in the Cosmos, for which there were two editions published by Academic Press. In the aftermath of 9/11, Dr. Zubay compiled, along with othercontributing authors Agents of Bioterrorism: Pathogens and their Weaponization published by Columbia University Press. Athletically gifted, Dr. Zubay enjoyed playing basketball with colleagues, swimming daily on the University campus, and relaxed playing poker with friends. After retirement, Dr. Zubay and his wife relocated to San Diego, CA where he served for three years as a visiting research scholar at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla. Dr. Zubay is survived by his wife of 47 years, Bongsoon, his son Geoffrey Pyong, Director of Neurosurgery Department at Memorial Hermann The Woodlands Hospital in Houston, TX, his daughter-in-law, Erin, and three grandchildren, Ryan, Abby, and Geoffrey Mitchell."

2014-02-12T00:00:00Z,"HOFFMAN--Deborah, was Principal Harpist at the Metropolitan Opera. Being the youngest child in a famous musical family she grew up hearing superb string playing. This background gave her harp playing a singing tone, inflected phrasing, and variety of tone colors and voicing that transcended the usual limitations of the instrument. As a young child she had such a naturally gifted ear that she was able to memorize pieces on first hearing. Her keen awareness of orchestral texture enabled her to unfailingly know exactly when and how to fit it. Early in her professional career she discovered that she had somehow developed the capacity to mind-read conductors to know exactly what their intentions were. This made her the favorite of many maestros. ""I can always count of her for exactly what I want,"" said James Levine, Music Director at the Met. ""She's a great musician, she's a great harpist, she's a great colleague, she's a great citizen in the orchestra."" Those who knew her can never forget her delightful sense of humor, positive attitude, enthusiasm, animated facial expressions and intellectual curiosity. Ever-present and aware, she could remember details from conversations or events that took place years in the past. A person of impeccable integrity, she had that rare capability of always speaking the truth, yet almost never offending. She is survived by her mother, Esther Glazer, and father, Irwin Hoffman, her brothers, Joel, Gary and Toby, her husband, Roger Nierenberg, nephews and nieces Sascha, Benjamin, Natania, Nasu, Solomon and two step-children, David and Rachel Nierenberg.

He became the first Administrator of the Institute and Executive Director of the Foundation, positions he held until his retirement in 1990. He remained on the NFFR Board and organized the Institute archives. He would loyally attend Institute functions and was especially proud to participate in the ribbon cutting at the dedication of the new Institute. He was gracious and thoughtful and always projected an air of equanimity. No task was ever too great and he devoted his life to the Institute and its mission. He earned a national reputation as an advocate for patients with facial difference. The Institute and myFace have lost a steadfast friend."

2014-02-12T00:00:00Z,"BAKER--Edwin H.,on February 10, 2014. Beloved husband of Linda Lee Baker and devoted father of Stephen Baker, Audrey Baker Golden and Linda Skolnick and their mates, Claudia Cowan, Mitchell Golden and David Skolnick; loving grandfather of Sabrina and Benjamin Baker, Devin and Adam Skolnick, Dario & Carina Baker Golden. Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Ed Baker attended M.I.T., Harvard Law School and received his post-graduate degree in Tax Law at New York University. A gifted writer and thinker, he wrote professionally for ""Tax Management,"" and lectured in his field at various venues in New York and Connecticut. He was a partner at Epstein, Becker and Green's Manhattan office, when he retired from practice, in 2009. There, he had specialized in working closely with clients to determine what he deemed ""elegant solutions"" for especially complicated tax and estate problems that had often been deemed ""insoluble"" by other lawyers. In order to keep current in his field, he spent three, nightly hours on professional reading, no matter how exhausting his schedule. This left him too little time to read on other subjects that interested him, so when he retired, he read widely and voraciously on his ever-present ""kindle"" e-reader and relished taking courses in Politics, History, Science and Music at University of Southern Florida's ""Lifelong Learning Program."" (In his attempt to make up for lost years of reading in the liberal arts, he had enthusiastically registered for nine courses at USF, this semester, alone.) With friends he made in these courses, he co-founded the Lakewood Ranch History Club, where he was a very active member. Fiercely proud of his Brooklyn roots, he said that, after the Brooklyn Dodgers left Ebbetts Field, he no longer had the heart to watch baseball. Besides enjoying theatre, opera and jazz, he was an avid, lifelong tennis player and bicycle enthusiast. He was never happier than during his retirement years in Sarasota, Florida. A proud member of the Sarasota Jazz Club, he especially enjoyed accompanying his wife, Linda, to hear her sing with her jazz trio jazz at various venues around town, where he was always surrounded by a crowd of friends who shared his love of jazz. Ed was adored by all his family and friends and respected by his colleagues.

She died on Sunday, February 9th, in Stuart, Florida after a brief illness. Martha was born in Dallas, Texas in 1926, the daughter of John Blackburn Muse and Kathryn Poole Burbank, but lived in New York City for most of her life. She maintained residences in New York City, Connecticut and Florida. Her principal interests focused on Latin America, but she contributed substantially to educational, corporate and non-profit areas. Martha was a founding director of the Tinker Foundation. She served as its president for 27 years and its chairman for 33 years, retiring in 2008. It was under her direction that the Foundation became a leading funder of Latin American-related activities providing support for educational, environmental, security, economic, legal and governance issues. Martha received her undergraduate degree from Barnard College in 1948 and a master's degree in political science from Columbia University in 1955. In 1981 she received an honorary doctorate from Georgetown University. She was the first woman elected as a trustee to Columbia University and was among the first women named to the Board of the New York Stock Exchange and the Council on Foreign Relations. She served on numerous corporate boards including The Bank of New York, May Department Stores, Sterling Drug Inc., ASARCO, ACF Industries and Associated Dry Goods. Her non-profit boards included the Americas Society, the Spanish Institute, and the Luso-American Development Foundation. For her many contributions to the field of Latin American relations she received numerous awards: Orden del Sol del Peru, Order of Bernardo O'Higgins (Chile), Order de Mayo al Merito (Argentina); Ordem Nacional do Cruzeiro do Sul (Brazil), and awards from the Spanish Institute and the Americas Society. She was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Colony Club, the Huguenot Society and the National Society of Colonial Dames. One of her final directives to the Tinker Foundation was incorporating Antarctica-related subjects under its funding mandate. Her support of Antarctica was recognized in 2009 by the establishment of the Muse Prize for Science and Policy in Antarctica, an award for mid-career Antarctic scientists and policy makers. A memorial service will be held in New York City in the late spring. Letters of inquiry and condolence may be sent to the Tinker Foundation, 55 E. 59th St., New York, NY 10022."

2014-02-13T00:00:00Z,"DITTMER--Frances ""Frannie"" Ronshausen, died February 5 in Mexico when the small charter plane on which she was sole passenger crashed en route from Puerto Vallarta to Careyes, where she owned a house and visited often. She was 72. The pilot, Alberto Navarro, also perished. A longtime former resident of Chicago and latterly of Aspen, Colorado, Mrs. Dittmer was a philanthropist and collector admired in preeminent art circles and beloved by family and friends of all stripes. ""She was a force behind some of the most important institutions in this country,"" said Philippe Vergne, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. ""Frannie's impact on our museum and museums across the country has been profound,"" said Aspen Art Museum Co-Presidents John Phelan and Paul Schoor. ""We could count on Frannie to speak her mind and make sure we took the right direction. Her leadership, vision, and friendship will always be treasured, and we already miss her and her infectious laugh."" And said James Rondeau, Dittmer Chair and Curator of Contemporary Art at the Art Institute of Chicago, ""She was incisive and discerning, generous and glamorous, a radiant personality with a devilish sense of humor."" Blonde and statuesque, Frannie was stylishly self-possessed, plainspoken, and prone to call a spade a shovel. She talkedand laughedwith a lilting twang that she never tried to lose, but it was the laugh that was her trademark. An exuberant and unmistakable chortle, it was audible from astonishing distances and once heard, was not forgotten. Born and raised in Port Arthur, Texas, she was a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin and a Kappa Kappa Gamma. From 1964 to 66 she worked on Capitol Hill as personal secretary to Democratic Texas Senator ""Smilin'"" Ralph Yarborough, an extraordinary responsibility for someone in her early 20s. In Washington she caught the eye of Thomas Dittmer, a young lieutenant in the fabled Third Infantry and a White House Social Aide. In 1966, Frannie and Tom married and moved to Chicago, where they raised a family, built a business, and collected art. When Tom and stepfather founded R.E. Friedman commodities firm Refco in 1969, Frannie became one of the company's first five employees. Refco's success grew exponentially, and Frannie cultivated her passion and keen eye for art. In 1979 she met Sotheby's Vice Chairman Anthony Grant, then a young associate in contemporary art, and the two began a lifelong journey. Through the years the collection evolved and changed from Modern masters such as Pablo Picasso and Fernand Leger, to post war giants Willem DeKooning and Jackson Pollock, to the art of our time by Cy Twombly, Brice Marden, and Christoper Wool. Concurrently Frannie also built a world class portfolio at Refco, with Adam Brooks as curator. Grounded in contemporary photography and in the works of master printmakers such as Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, the collection was preserved after Tom sold the company to private shareholders in 1999. The Dittmers were involved in numerous Chicago civic and arts organizations, including the Chicago Lyric Opera and Providence St. Mel School, but Frannie's heart lay most fondly with the visual arts. In addition to her AIC trusteeship, she and Tom endowed there the Frances and Thomas Dittmer Chair of Modern and Contemporary Art. She was also a life trustee at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago where, together with Tom, she was one of six board members seminal to fundraising for that institution's expansion in 1991, leading to the first major museum building in Chicago in 65 years. Throughout her life, Frannie participated substantively in many of the nation's most prestigious arts organizations, including in New York the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney, the Drawing Center, Dia Art Foundation, the Menil collection in Houston, and the Aspen Art Museum. Her magnanimity extended to animals, dogs in particular, and she supported a number of shelters and rescue organizations. Her cherished Chihuahuas once graced the cover of the Aspen Animal Shelter calendar, which made her immensely proud. Generous as well in their spirited entertaining of friends and associates, the Dittmers hosted famously creative and occasionally lavish parties. Her houses were always comfortable and beautifully designed, befitting her longtime collaboration and friendship and with designer David Easton. Not everyone knew she had her pilot's license and played the piano by ear, but her reputation as a football aficionada and Bears fan was well established. In the early days she and Tom played flag football with friends, and she was invariably the first one picked. ""She was a master of the quick kick,"" Tom boasts. ""And hell, she could throw the ball 50 yards."" More recently her children recall their fashionably clad mother loping across the lawn in Hermes sandals, manicured nails rasping on the pigskin as she threw perfectly spiraling passes to her grandsons. In 1994, as winds of business and finance shifted, the Dittmers left Chicago for New York, and after 33 years of marriage the formidable couple went their separate ways, divorcing amicably in 1999. Frannie moved permanently to Aspen, where they had long had a second home and where she was, not surprisingly, active in the community. The family nonetheless remained close and often spent holidays together. Surviving are son Jason and his wife Allison of Park City, Utah; grandsons Casey and Jesse; daughter Alexis Gaughan and her husband Chris of Santa Monica, California; and Chris's daughters Casey and Peyton. A sister, Marilyn, and her husband Warren ""Dutch"" Holland, live in Durango, Colorado. Frannie also counted as family Matthew Morris, who for 25 years faithfully headed her household staff. The family respectfully suggests that gifts in Frannie's memory go to a charity of the giver's choice. Afternoon services will be held both in Aspen on Wednesday, February 19, in Aspen, and in Chicago on Friday, February 21, details to be announced."
2014-02-13T00:00:00Z,"ADLER--Marion (Stern) died on Tuesday, February 4th, 2014 in Boca Raton, Florida, (former resident of Harrison, Westchester County) after a long battle with breast cancer. She was still able to celebrate her 90th Birthday on January 19th with her family members and friends. Marion was born in Hamburg, Germany, of Alice Stern-Nathan and Leopold Stern who was a well to-do business owner, and lost it all when he was picked-up by the Gestapo and incarcerated for six weeks until Alice and Walter were able to free him by presenting a cablegram from the relatives in the U.S. who deposited the money for their departure. Traumatized Marion was finally able to leave the only homeland she knew behind and leave Nazi Germany via Cuba. After six months in Cuba the Visas to the United States had been obtained and the family traveled to New York City. Poor but alive, young Marion did her part in helping the family to make a living by taking on live-in baby sitting jobs and also finishing her education. Her older brother, Walter, two years her senior joined the army and helped the family become financially independent. Young Marion fell in love with a handsome young man, George Adler of Switzerland, who became successful on his own merits. Marion started her new life by giving birth to her three sons in short intervals. She raised her family with devotion and found time to become a successful travel consultant as well. Marion is survived by her brother Walter Stern of Englewood, NJ, her children, Gary, Andre and Roger, Vicki Adler, daughter-in-law and wife of Roger, her joy in her later years, grandsons, Jason and Spencer and Michelle Stern, niece."

2014-02-13T00:00:00Z,"HOFFMAN--Deborah, was Principal Harpist at the Metropolitan Opera. Being the youngest child in a famous musical family she grew up hearing superb string playing. This background gave her harp playing a singing tone, inflected phrasing, and variety of tone colors and voicing that transcended the usual limitations of the instrument. As a young child she had such a naturally gifted ear that she was able to memorize pieces on first hearing. Her keen awareness of orchestral texture enabled her to unfailingly know exactly when and how to fit it. Early in her professional career she discovered that she had somehow developed the capacity to mind-read conductors to know exactly what their intentions were. This made her the favorite of many maestros. ""I can always count on her for exactly what I want,"" said James Levine, Music Director at the Met. ""She's a great musician, she's a great harpist, she's a great colleague, she's a great citizen in the orchestra."" Those who knew her can never forget her delightful sense of humor, positive attitude, enthusiasm, animated facial expressions and intellectual curiosity. Ever-present and aware, she could remember details from conversations or events that took place years in the past. A person of impeccable integrity, she had that rare capability of always speaking the truth, yet almost never offending. She is survived by her mother, Esther Glazer, and father, Irwin Hoffman, her brothers, Joel, Gary and Toby, her husband, Roger Nierenberg, nephews and nieces Sascha, Benjamin, Natania, Nasu, Solomon and two step-children, David and Rachel Nierenberg. A funeral will be held on Thursday, February 13 at 3pm at the Riverside Memorial Chapel at 180 West 76 Street."

Martha was born in Dallas, Texas in 1926, the daughter of John Blackburn Muse and Kathryn Poole Burbank, but lived in New York City for most of her life.

Her non-profit boards included the Americas Society, the Spanish Institute, and the Luso-American Development Foundation. For her many contributions to the field of Latin American relations she received numerous awards: Orden del Sol del Peru, Order of Bernardo O'Higgins (Chile), Order de Mayo al Merito (Argentina); Ordem Nacional do Cruzeiro do Sul (Brazil), and awards from the Spanish Institute and the Americas Society. She was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Colony Club, the Huguenot Society and the National Society of Colonial Dames.

Her support of Antarctica was recognized in 2009 by the establishment of the Muse Prize for Science and Policy in Antarctica, an award for mid-career Antarctic scientists and policy makers. A memorial service will be held in New York City in the late spring. Letters of inquiry and condolence may be sent to the Tinker Foundation, 55 E. 59th St., New York, NY 10022."

2014-02-15T00:00:00Z,"DELL--Lorraine Langfan, passed away peacefully at home on Thursday morning, February 13, 2014. She was born in New York City on August 5, 1937. Lorraine is survived by her husband Alex, her son Steven and his wife Jamie, her son Michael and his wife Susan, her son Adam, and her ten grandchildren: Jordan, Kira, Madeline, Alexa, Olivia, Zachary, Juliette, Jacob, Krishna and Julian. She is also survived by Marci Dell and by her uncle, William K. Langfan. Lorraine graduated from Baruch College in New York City, with a major in economics. After Lorraine and Alex married in 1959, Alex enlisted in the Army and they were stationed in Killeen, Texas. There was no employment for an economist in Killeen, so Lorraine became a second grade teacher. After Killeen, Lorraine and Alex lived in New York City for one year and then moved to Buffalo where their first son, Steven, was born. Lorraine and Alex lived the life of graduate students and enjoyed raising their newborn son. In 1962, Lorraine and Alex packed their bags and headed to Houston. Lorraine blossomed there and had a second son, Michael, followed by a third son, Adam. She and Alex developed friendships in Houston that would last the rest of their lives. Lorraine later returned to her interest in economics and became a stock broker. She was the first woman broker at her Paine Webber office in Houston and one of the most successful. Lorraine was active in the community, chairing programs at the Jewish Community Center, and serving on the boards of the Anti-Defamation League, MD Anderson, The Aspen Institute and the Houston Symphony. Throughout their lives Lorraine and Alex traveled the world but what she loved most was returning to New York City to connect with friends and family. She also loved Aspen where they have a home and many friends. She was the guiding light that steered her family and set it on an admirable path. Lorraine easily made friends who remain deeply devoted to her, because she was happy, perceptive, caring and loyal. Grandma Lorraine, as she is known by her grandchildren, was preceded in death by her parents, Hilda and Rubin Langfan and her sister, Judith Shilling. Her entire family, including numerous nieces, nephews and cousins mourn her passing. Each one adores her and always looked to her for guidance in their lives. Lorraine's final three years were plagued with serious illness and various medical challenges. Lorraine was brave, tenacious and tough through all she endured. Her children, grandchildren, everyone who knew her were inspired by her constant positive attitude and her intellect. She pushed herself to overcome many obstacles and challenges. Lorraine was nick-named ""Mama Warrior"" by her family, because she was fierce and determined. The family wishes to express gratitude to all of the nursing and medical staff at Methodist Hospital, as well as Dr. Kim Bloom, Dr. Stuart Dobbs and Dr. Stuart Yudofsky. Special thanks go to her caregivers, Melly Rocha, Consuela Medrano, Maria Martinez, Solange Mariani, Tracie Hartman and to her longtime friend and companion Malua Barnes. The funeral service will be held on Sunday, February 16, 2014 at 10:30am at Congregation Beth Yeshurun. After the Synagogue service a private interment will take place at Beth Yeshurun Post Oak Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, Lorraine would be honored if donations were made to The Jewish Federation of Houston or the Houston Symphony."

She was living in Florida with her daughter and son-in-law, Vanessa and Winthrop Wassenar, at the time. She was an extraordinary woman of academic achievement and wide-ranging interests. She was born in Philadelphia, graduated from Sarah Lawrence College at the age of 19, and was among the first cohort of Presidential Scholars. In the last years of WWII, she was placed as a desk officer in the State Department in Washington DC, where she met and married her husband, Walter. They then lived in New York City, Pittsburgh, and ultimately moved back to New York, but enjoyed extensive world-wide travel throughout the years. Her PhD in Spanish Literature, from the University of Pittsburgh, was evidence of her desire to broaden her horizons, and also utilize her exceptional talent for mastering languages. This gift was of benefit to her, her many friends who cherished her, and also her 27-year volunteer service to the Hospitality Committee for United Nations Delegations. She was a long-time member of the Colony Club, Union Club, Foreign Policy Association, Modern Language Association, St. George's Society, and many other charitable organizations, and her volunteer service to them was a great joy to her. She and her husband were deeply devoted to each other and celebrated their golden anniversary in the year he died. They were members of the congregation of St. Thomas Church, their spiritual home, for more than 60 years. She was a loving mother and grandmother, and her death leaves us all in sorrow.

2014-02-16T00:00:00Z,"STEVENS--Joseph C.,a prominent experimental psychologist and longtime member of the Yale University faculty, died unexpectedly but peacefully on February 7, 2014, at his home in New Haven, CT. He was 84. Dr. Stevens was widely known for his work investigating human sensory perception using principles of psychophysics. Psychophysics refers to methods for quantifying what a person can perceive through the senses, such as the smallest noticeable concentration of an odor or the physical intensity of a sound perceived to be louder than another. Dr. Stevens was born on February 28, 1929 in Grand Rapids, MI, and graduated from Calvin College in Grand Rapids with an A.B. in Biology in 1951. He began his graduate studies at Michigan State University, earning an M.A. in psychology in 1953, and continued them at Harvard University, where he worked under the supervision of S.S. Stevens (not a relation), a founder of modern psychophysics. He received a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1957, and then continued at Harvard as an instructor and assistant professor of psychology until 1966, when he joined the John B. Pierce Laboratory, an independent research institute in New Haven affiliated with Yale University. Dr. Stevens was appointed as fellow at the Pierce Laboratory and as research associate (later, senior research scientist) and lecturer in psychology at Yale. At the Pierce Laboratory, he established its psychology-psychophysics group, which expanded under his leadership to six faculty scientists plus numerous supporting scientists, staff and students. The group quickly became recognized as a world-class center for research on human sensory processes, publishing, over a period of three decades, more than 500 articles, books, and other scientific and scholarly works. Notable among Dr. Stevens's many scientific findings was evidence of how aging blunts sensory perception, especially in touch, taste, and smell. Dr. Stevens found, for example, that many elderly individuals cannot detect the odor-warning agent added to natural gas. For his work on aging in smell and taste, Dr. Stevens received a special Merit Award Grant from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health. In addition to these scientific activities, Dr. Stevens taught and mentored scores of students at Yale. Dr. Stevens led an active life in New Haven surrounded by many friends and coworkers. Shortly after joining the faculty at Yale, he became a fellow of its Jonathan Edwards College, where for two decades he lived as a resident fellow. He is remembered for his loyalty to the college and for reaching out to its undergraduate students and counseling them. He was also a devout member of Christ Church, New Haven, and enjoyed the Yale Repertory Theater, the Yale Cabaret, good restaurants, classical music and Shakespeare's plays. An avid bike rider who also enjoyed hiking and skiing, he nevertheless donated considerable time to many causes, actively helping others. He was also devoted to his large extended family. He was one of six siblings, who included the late Joan Stevens VanderPloeg, Esther Stevens Wisse and Henry Ghysels Stevens. He is survived by two sisters, Miriam Stevens Loomis of East Lansing, MI, and Judith Stevens Hooker, and her husband, Robert L. Hooker, of East Grand Rapids MI, as well as fifteen nieces and nephews and 35 great-nieces and nephews. They, as well as his colleagues and friends, will miss his warmth, his kindness and his generosity of spirit.

She was born March 8, 1932, in New York City where she was a life long resident. She had a loving and devoted marriage to Jim Ruth, a professional cartoonist and a Vice President at Manufacturer's Hanover Bank in charge of artwork and video presentations. Gerry's professional career was as a librarian. With her husband she was actively involved in the entertainment and social life of New York. Their clubs included The Lambs, The Sons of the Desert. At her passing she was an officer of The Lambs, its Historian. She was a longtime active member of the Ziegfeld Club, serving as its treasurer, and of the Twelfth Night Club where she was a member of its board of directors. During a low period in the fortunes of The Lambs, she worked with her husband to help keep this venerable club alive. When financial difficulties during the 1960's forced the suspension of its newsletter, The Lambs Script, which had been founded in 1932, she and Jim produced an interim publication to keep club members informed. With the reinstatement of The Lambs Script in the 1990's, they contributed a regular column, ""News of The Lambs."" After Jim's passing in 2005 she continued the column under her own by-line. A very social person, she met regularly with friends at The Lambs or Sardi's Restaurant. An avid movie buff, she went with friends on Turner Classic Movie cruises, and at the drop of a hat it was like her to fly off to Hollywood for a movie festival. This kindly, caring, gifted and giving lady will be sorely missed and never forgotten by her many friends, one of whom once told her, ""You know, Gerry, you are not just loved. You are beloved."" She is survived by a brother-in-law, Jack Ruth, of Queens. Her many friends were her family. A memorial service will be held at the Three West Club in New York, to be announced.

2014-02-17T00:00:00Z,"LEAVY--H. James, of Westport, CT, died peacefully on February 10, 2014, at the age of 83. Born on May 29, 1930, in New York, NY, James was the son of entrepreneur Samuel Leavy and social columnist Lena L. Leavy, and brother to predeceased Gerald Leavy, who passed away in 2012. Too young to enlist during WWII but greatly motivated to serve his country, James accelerated his studies by graduating from the Milton Academy one year early and matriculated to George Washington University. Upon graduation, James quickly enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, eventually rising to the rank of Lieutenant. James was stationed and fought in Korea during the first years of the Korean War and was later stationed in Tokyo and Hawaii. He was a proud Veteran who always extolled the greatness of America and its promise of freedom and democracy around the world. Upon returning to the United States, James began a successful career in the fashion industry serving in executive positions, first at Stern Brothers where he met a beautiful retail buyer, Emilia Anne Zemo, who went on to be his wife of nearly 60 years. James later worked at Colonial Corporation of the Gulf and Western Corp., and later in his career, at Mast Industries in Brookline, MA, where he was the Executive Vice President of Asian Operations. James was a loving husband, son, brother, father, and grandfather. He is survived by his wife Emilia Anne, five children Donald Leavy, Dana Langham, Daniel Leavy, Douglas Lowell, and David Leavy, and nine healthy and happy grandchildren Emily, Wesley, Jeremy, Caitlin, Megan, Christopher, Edward, Gavin and Gardiner. James was a voracious reader whose passions included history, politics, national security, international travel, horse racing, and his favorite New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle. James had a passion for Winston Churchill, whom he greatly admired for his mastery of emotive language, and was always handy with an appropriate Churchill quote for whatever the moment required. He was known to family, friends and colleagues for his sharp wit, booming voice, superior vocabulary, and cultured intellect. He will be greatly missed."

2014-02-17T00:00:00Z,"STEVENS--Joseph C.,a prominent experimental psychologist and longtime member of the Yale University faculty, died unexpectedly but peacefully on February 7, 2014, at his home in New Haven, CT. He was 84. Dr. Stevens was widely known for his work investigating human sensory perception using principles of psychophysics. Psychophysics refers to methods for quantifying what a person can perceive through the senses, such as the smallest noticeable concentration of an odor or the physical intensity of a sound perceived to be louder than another. Dr. Stevens was born on February 28, 1929 in Grand Rapids, MI, and graduated from Calvin College in Grand Rapids with an A.B. in Biology in 1951. He began his graduate studies at Michigan State University, earning an M.A. in psychology in 1953, and continued them at Harvard University, where he worked under the supervision of S.S. Stevens (not a relation), a founder of modern psychophysics. He received a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1957, and then continued at Harvard as an instructor and assistant professor of psychology until 1966, when he joined the John B. Pierce Laboratory, an independent research institute in New Haven affiliated with Yale University. Dr. Stevens was appointed as fellow at the Pierce Laboratory and as research associate (later, senior research scientist) and lecturer in psychology at Yale. At the Pierce Laboratory, he established its psychology-psychophysics group, which expanded under his leadership to six faculty scientists plus numerous supporting scientists, staff and students. The group quickly became recognized as a world-class center for research on human sensory processes, publishing, over a period of three decades, more than 500 articles, books, and other scientific and scholarly works. Notable among Dr. Stevens's many scientific findings was evidence of how aging blunts sensory perception, especially in touch, taste, and smell. Dr. Stevens found, for example, that many elderly individuals cannot detect the odor-warning agent added to natural gas. For his work on aging in smell and taste, Dr. Stevens received a special Merit Award Grant from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health. In addition to these scientific activities, Dr. Stevens taught and mentored scores of students at Yale. Dr. Stevens led an active life in New Haven surrounded by many friends and coworkers. Shortly after joining the faculty at Yale, he became a fellow of its Jonathan Edwards College, where for two decades he lived as a resident fellow. He is remembered for his loyalty to the college and for reaching out to its undergraduate students and counseling them. He was also a devout member of Christ Church, New Haven, and enjoyed the Yale Repertory Theater, the Yale Cabaret, good restaurants, classical music and Shakespeare's plays. An avid bike rider who also enjoyed hiking and skiing, he nevertheless donated considerable time to many causes, actively helping others. He was also devoted to his large extended family. He was one of six siblings, who included the late Joan Stevens VanderPloeg, Esther Stevens Wisse and Henry Ghysels Stevens. He is survived by two sisters, Miriam Stevens Loomis of East Lansing, MI, and Judith Stevens Hooker, and her husband, Robert L. Hooker, of East Grand Rapids MI, as well as fifteen nieces and nephews and 35 great-nieces and nephews. They, as well as his colleagues and friends, will miss his warmth, his kindness and his generosity of spirit. Memorial Services will be held at Christ Church (Episcopal) in New Haven on April 5 at 11:00am and in Grand Rapids at a later date. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Community Foundation of Greater New Haven or Calvin College."

2014-02-17T00:00:00Z,"DORFMAN--Sid, Celebrated sports writer Sid Dorfman, whose career covering New Jersey high school sports spanned 79 years and made him an enduring fixture in the states sports community, died Saturday at his home. He was 94. Dorfman was only 15 when he went to work as a high school sports correspondent for the Morning Ledger, predecessor to The Star-Ledger. Three years later, in 1938, at the behest of The Star-Ledger, he took over an independent bureau in Newark that was providing the newspaper with coverage of local sports and news. He would run it for the next 76 years. Today, that bureau, Dorf Feature Service, continues to service The Star-Ledger, its sister regional New Jersey newspapers, and its digital property, NJ.com, with what has long been regarded as the most comprehensive high school sports coverage in the country. In addition to chronicling the accomplishments of student-athletes and coaches, Dorfman wrote a general sports column for The Star-Ledger and won numerous writing awards. In 1998, he was inducted into the New Jersey Sports Hall of Fame. Early in his career, while also running Dorf Feature Service, he was a makeup editor and sat on the sports copy desk at The Star-Ledger. He also covered boxing and became the newspaper's first golf writer. As a general sports columnist, he wrote frequently on local and national amateur and professional sports. He retired as a columnist only several months ago due to declining health. Dorfman influenced generations of journalists who started their careers at Dorf Feature Service. The bureau's versatile coverage also included New Jersey college sports, town news, education, harness and thoroughbred racing, amateur and professional golf and tennis, New Jersey society, and obituaries. In the 1970s, he successfully campaigned for a high school football playoff system that would identify sectional state champions on the field of play, replacing ranking systems that declared champions on the basis of mathematical formulas. He also pushed for a realignment of high school sports conferences to promote a more fair and demographically balanced competitive environment. Led by Dorfman, The Star-Ledger was the first newspaper in the metropolitan area to provide comprehensive coverage of girls' high school sports. He also introduced Top 20 team rankings and All-State honor teams to the coverage. Dorfman, a former president of the New Jersey Sports Writers Association and a recipient of its Distinguished Service Award, was inducted into the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association Hall of Fame in 1999. The NJSIAA isstate's governing body of high school sports. Surviving are his wife, Marianne; his daughter, Rhoda; his son, Gary, and his wife, Marianne Dorfman; his son, Joseph; his grandson, Scott, and his wife, Elana Dorfman; and grandchildren, Jessica Dorfman and Lael Dorfman.

2014-02-18T00:00:00Z,"ZECKENDORF--William Jr.,84, died on February 12, 2014 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Born in Manhattan on October 31, 1929, William Zeckendorf transformed the skyline of New York City and pioneered in changing the urban landscape of the city from Union Square to the Upper West Side. It is with deep love and admiration that we honor the life of our father and celebrate him as our devoted mentor. His brilliance in defining the future for neglected and decaying urban neighborhoods is legendary. When the Upper West Side was far distant from what it is today, William Zeckendorf built The Columbia at West 96th Street and Broadway, a development that undeniably helped to spur a West Side residential renaissance that continues today. He also built some of New York City's finest luxury developments including the Park Belvedere, Vanderbilt and Central Park Place. In midtown, William Zeckendorf built the elegant Four Seasons Hotel, and 4 Columbus Circle, a commercial building that stood alone, long before the successful destination that Columbus Circle has become. Downtown, Union Square could hardly be seen as the vibrant area that it is now. Zeckendorf Towers, envisioned by William Zeckendorf in the 1980's, led the way for the thriving 21st Century commercial and residential neighborhood that Union Square is today. The flourishing Eighth Avenue corridor is due in large measure to what William Zeckendorf saw and accomplished in his development of Worldwide Plaza, well before others followed with new developments now lining the Avenue. Worldwide Plaza was perhaps New York City's first genuine modern mixed use development combining corporate office headquarters with residential, cultural and theater facilities along with a mid-block public plaza. Other major projects included the Ronald Reagan Office Building in Washington, D.C. He was a man of great taste and culture, having served for over 50 years as an esteemed member of the Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin. His passion for the arts and education leave a lasting legacy from New York to Santa Fe. His quarter century of service to Long Island University preceded his deep commitment to philanthropy in his role as Founding Director of the Lensic Performing Arts Center in Santa Fe and his passionate support of The Santa Fe Opera, the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, Christus St. Vincent Hospital and the College of Santa Fe. William Zeckendorf contributed his great vision to the City of New York and its residents, who benefit enormously every day from his lifetime of achievements. He is survived by his wife, Nancy, his sister Susan Zeckendorf Nicholson, his sons Arthur Zeckendorf and William Lie Zeckendorf and two grandchildren. We are forever thankful and grateful for the wonderful lesson your life has been for us. A memorial service will be held in New York City on March 5th, and on March 29th in Sante Fe, New Mexico. Donations in his memory may be made to the Lensic Performing Arts Center, 211 West San Francisco Street, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87501. Arthur Zeckendorf William Lie Zeckendorf"

2014-02-18T00:00:00Z,"DORFMAN--Sid, Celebrated sports writer Sid Dorfman, whose career covering New Jersey high school sports spanned 79 years and made him an enduring fixture in the states sports community, died Saturday at his home. He was 94. Dorfman was only 15 when he went to work as a high school sports correspondent for the Morning Ledger, predecessor to The Star-Ledger. Three years later, in 1938, at the behest of The Star-Ledger, he took over an independent bureau in Newark that was providing the newspaper with coverage of local sports and news. He would run it for the next 76 years. Today, that bureau, Dorf Feature Service, continues to service The Star-Ledger, its sister regional New Jersey newspapers, and its digital property, NJ.com, with what has long been regarded as the most comprehensive high school sports coverage in the country. In addition to chronicling the accomplishments of student-athletes and coaches, Dorfman wrote a general sports column for The Star-Ledger and won numerous writing awards. In 1998, he was inducted into the New Jersey Sports Hall of Fame. Early in his career, while also running Dorf Feature Service, he was a makeup editor and sat on the sports copy desk at The Star-Ledger. He also covered boxing and became the newspaper's first golf writer. As a general sports columnist, he wrote frequently on local and national amateur and professional sports. He retired as a columnist only several months ago due to declining health. Dorfman influenced generations of journalists who started their careers at Dorf Feature Service. The bureau's versatile coverage also included New Jersey college sports, town news, education, harness and thoroughbred racing, amateur and professional golf and tennis, New Jersey society, and obituaries. In the 1970s, he successfully campaigned for a high school football playoff system that would identify sectional state champions on the field of play, replacing ranking systems that declared champions on the basis of mathematical formulas. He also pushed for a realignment of high school sports conferences to promote a more fair and demographically balanced competitive environment. Led by Dorfman, The Star-Ledger was the first newspaper in the metropolitan area to provide comprehensive coverage of girls' high school sports. He also introduced Top 20 team rankings and All-State honor teams to the coverage. Dorfman, a former president of the New Jersey Sports Writers Association and a recipient of its Distinguished Service Award, was inducted into the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association Hall of Fame in 1999. The NJSIAA isstate's governing body of high school sports. Surviving are his wife, Marianne; his daughter, Rhoda; his son, Gary, and his wife, Marianne Dorfman; his son, Joseph; his grandson, Scott, and his wife, Elana Dorfman; and grandchildren, Jessica Dorfman and Lael Dorfman. Sid was also predeceased by his grandson, Jason. Services will be held Tuesday at 1pm at Temple Beth AhmYisrael, 60 Temple Drive, Springfield, NJ. Services are by BernheimApterKreitzman Funeral Chapel, Livingston, NJ."

Born in the East Bronx on November 18th, Jay was a scientist, a psychoanalyst, and an artist. In a long scientific career that included a 17 year directorship of the Institute of Animal Behavior at Rutgers, Jay received numerous honors and awards. Among the first to study the role of hormones, the brain and experience in the regulation of mothering, Jay laid the groundwork for a field of inquiry, the psychobiology of mammalian maternal behavior. His many students, post-docs, and younger colleagues benefited enormously from his professional and personal guidance, and his influence continues through them and their students. For much of his career Jay also saw patients in his Upper West Side apartment, wishing to maintain a balance between the theoretical and practical aspects of psychology. As a high school student, Jay studied art through the Works Progress Administration. He served in WWII as a camouflage artist, and painting remained important to him throughout his life. Jay was married to Gilda Rosenblatt (nee Rosen) until her death in 1999. He is survived by his second wife, Pat, his children Daniel and Nina, and his grandchildren Olivia and Susannah.

2014-02-20T00:00:00Z,"ZECKENDORF--William Jr.,84, died on February 12, 2014 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Born in Manhattan on October 31, 1929, William Zeckendorf transformed the skyline of New York City and pioneered in changing the urban landscape of the city from Union Square to the Upper West Side. It is with deep love and admiration that we honor the life of our father and celebrate him as our devoted mentor. His brilliance in defining the future for neglected and decaying urban neighborhoods is legendary. When the Upper West Side was far distant from what it is today, William Zeckendorf built The Columbia at West 96th Street and Broadway, a development that undeniably helped to spur a West Side residential renaissance that continues today. He also built some of New York City's finest luxury developments including the Park Belvedere, Vanderbilt and Central Park Place. In midtown, William Zeckendorf built the elegant Four Seasons Hotel, and 4 Columbus Circle, a commercial building that stood alone, long before the successful destination that Columbus Circle has become. Downtown, Union Square could hardly be seen as the vibrant area that it is now. Zeckendorf Towers, envisioned by William Zeckendorf in the 1980's, led the way for the thriving 21st Century commercial and residential neighborhood that Union Square is today. The flourishing Eighth Avenue corridor is due in large measure to what William Zeckendorf saw and accomplished in his development of Worldwide Plaza, well before others followed with new developments now lining the Avenue. Worldwide Plaza was perhaps New York City's first genuine modern mixed use development combining corporate office headquarters with residential, cultural and theater facilities along with a mid-block public plaza. Other major projects included the Ronald Reagan Office Building in Washington, D.C. He was a man of great taste and culture, having served for over 50 years as an esteemed member of the Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin. His passion for the arts and education leave a lasting legacy from New York to Santa Fe. His quarter century of service to Long Island University preceded his deep commitment to philanthropy in his role as Founding Director of the Lensic Performing Arts Center in Santa Fe and his passionate support of The Santa Fe Opera, the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, Christus St. Vincent Hospital and the College of Santa Fe. William Zeckendorf contributed his great vision to the City of New York and its residents, who benefit enormously every day from his lifetime of achievements. He is survived by his wife, Nancy, his sister Susan Zeckendorf Nicholson, his sons Arthur Zeckendorf and William Lie Zeckendorf and two grandchildren. We are forever thankful and grateful for the wonderful lesson your life has been for us. A memorial service will be held in New York City at 4pm on March 5th. Please call 1-212-508-7273 for details. A memorial service will be held on March 29th in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Donations in his memory may be made to the Lensic Performing Arts Center, 211 West San Francisco Street, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87501. Arthur Zeckendorf William Lie Zeckendorf"

2014-02-21T00:00:00Z,"BLOEDE--Merle Huie. Mickey died February 18th, 2014 in Dallas, TX after a remarkably courageous six year struggle with cancer. She was born in Lohn, TX, on May 4th, 1921, a town founded by her great-grandfather in the 1890s. She was the daughter of Hulon William Huie and Anna (Lohn) Huie. She graduated from Lohn High School in 1938. Despite her academic achievements she was unable to continue her education due to the effects of the Great Depression. She was very proud of her work in management at the Office of Censorship during the war. After the war she married a young 8th Air Force Bombardier, named Vic Bloede, on March 11, 1945. Shortly thereafter they started their life together in New York, where Vic began his remarkable career in advertising, ably aided by Mickey. Her insight into people, personalities, and business helped propel Vic to the very top of the advertising world where he retired as chairman of Benton & Bowles, one of the largest international agencies at that time. He always said he couldn't have done it without her. Outside of advertising Mickey had a wide variety of interests including significant philanthropic pursuits and charitable activities. Her achievements included the founding of North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, and service on the executive board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Society, NYC, and work with American Cancer Society, among many others. In the social realm she served as President of the North Shore Southern Society. Also, Mickey was a member of a number of clubs: Sands Point (NY) Bath & Tennis, Manhasset Bay Yacht Club, Flower Hill Garden, Delray Dunes (FL) Golf and Country, and The Ocean Club of Florida. She was a member of the Community Reformed Church, Manhasset, NY, First Presbyterian Church, Delray Beach, FL, and later Highland Park Presbyterian Church, Dallas, TX. Throughout Mickey's life her intellect, wide ranging curiosity, keen wit, and fondness for a good debate were her hallmarks. It is worth noting because of her self-taught business acumen, her stock broker often consulted her. Mickey joked that he should be paying her. But beyond all her experiences and accomplishments clearly the most important thing in her life was the love of her family, by whom she will be dearly missed. Mickey was preceded in death by her husband of fifty four years, Victor G. Bloede. Survived by her three children, Dee Anna Smith Willis, Victor G. Bloede IV, and Susan Lohn Quaid, and grandchildren Elizabeth Murphy, Amy Arata, Lindsay Carneal, Alexandra Quaid, Victor G. Bloede V, Forrest Bloede, Laura Bloede, sister- in-law Rama Huie, a dozen grandchildren, and many nieces and nephews. Memorial service February 24th, 4pm at Highland Park Presbyterian Church, Dallas."

2014-02-21T00:00:00Z,"BALDWIN--David M.,85, of Vero Beach, Florida and Short Hills, New Jersey, died peacefully at his Florida home on February 16, 2014. David will be remembered as a caring gentleman, a loving husband and father, a hugely accomplished New York real estate investor and a champion in athletics, philanthropy and community enrichment. David was born in East Orange, New Jersey in 1928, and was raised in South Orange, New Jersey. The memorable summers of his early years were at the Baldwin family compound at Northampton Shores of Southampton Township. He graduated from the Pingry School in 1947 before attending William and Mary College and graduating in 1951 from Lehigh University with a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration. David served his country in the counterintelligence unit of the army and in 1954 became a real estate broker with the former Charles F. Noyes Company, Inc. In 1964, at the age of 35, he became President and Chief Executive of the company, the youngest chief executive officer of a major national real estate company. He negotiated the sale of the Noyes Company, together with Brown, Harris and Stevens to Mr. Harry Helmsley. This vital partnership lead to responsibility with Mr. Helmsley for many notable properties in New York City and across the country. Among the many awards that recognized his personal accomplishments: in 1964 The Real Estate Board of New York's ""Young Man of the Year Award""; in 1966 its ""Most Ingenious Deal in Manhattan"" award, and in 1977 ""Man of the Year"" award from the Realty Foundation of New York. David exclusively represented many major corporations for their headquarters and staffing space. In 1994 following the winding down of the Helmsley portfolio, the David M. Baldwin Realty Company, Inc., was formed to specialize in the management of real estate in downtown Manhattan. David served on numerous real estate boards and foundations including the Real Estate Board of New York where he was governor and director and the Realty Foundation of New York. He was also the former Chairman and President of the Public Development Corporation of New York City. Throughout David's career, he instinctively sought to share his personal prosperity with many institutions and worthy initiatives in education, health care and the arts as a trustee and philanthropist. He was a founding member of the board of the Henry Stifel Spinal Cord Injury Foundation and ultimately a Vice-Chair of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation; at Lehigh, he enabled the renovation of The Taylor Gym and created an endowed scholarship fund; at the Pingry School, his generosity helped enable a new campus and he commissioned a monumental bronze replica of Dr. John Pingry; he served as a longstanding Chair of the Strang Cancer Prevention Center in New York and was a member of the board of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; he also served as Vice Chairman of The Riverside Theatre in Vero Beach and he generously supported Overlook Medical Center in Summit, New Jersey, the Indian River Medical Center in Vero Beach, Florida and The Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey, among other charities. David Baldwin was an accomplished athlete. At Pingry he was an all-star fullback and state ranked track star. Golf, however, was his keenest talent. He was a co-captain of the golf team at Lehigh and in 1954, he won the New Jersey State Open Championship and was runner-up in the National Lefthanders Golf Championship. He twice qualified for the U.S. Amateur and was also Club Champion at Baltusrol, Rock Spring and Essex County in New Jersey. In 2000, he was included in the ""Team of the Century"" by the New Jersey Star Ledger. He was a longstanding member of the United States Senior Golf Association. Club memberships included: in New Jersey Baltusrol Golf Club, where he was President, and The Short Hills Club; in Florida The John's Island Club, The Red Stick Golf Club and The Windsor Club in Vero Beach; and in New York Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, National Golf Links Club of America, The Meadow Club, The Bathing Corporation of Southampton, The University Club, and Doubles. Magic was David's fascination since early childhood. He assembled one of the most prominent personal collections of magic apparatus in the world. As a member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, David published biographies of the Great Raymond and of Del-Ray-America's Foremost Magician. He enabled the creation of a new headquarters for The Magic Circle in London, among the most exclusive clubs in the world. In 1977, David commissioned a bronze figure of David Deviant that has become a coveted award for distinguished magicians around the world. In 2006 as an Honorary Lifetime Member he was awarded the Magic Circle's Silver Wand for outstanding service. As a devoted husband and father, he is survived by his loving family which include his wife of thirty-seven years, Barbara M. Baldwin; three sons, David Jr. of Basking Ridge, New Jersey; Alfred of Port Orange, Florida; William of Sag Harbor, New York; two stepchildren, Martin ""Fritz"" Stein III of Landing, New Jersey, Kimberly Paige Fleming of Aspen, Colorado; three grandchildren Liam Fleming, Alexander and Paulina Stein and a twin brother Theodore Baldwin of Summit, New Jersey. David was pre-deceased by his youngest son Ted and a brother, Cyril. Contributions as a memorial may be made in David's name to The Pingry School, 131 Martinsville Road, Basking Ridge, New Jersey 07920; Lehigh University, 27 Memorial Drive West, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania 18015; or The Riverside Theatre, 3250 Riverside Park Drive, Vero Beach, Florida 32963.

2014-02-22T00:00:00Z,"BLOEDE--Merle Huie. Mickey died February 18th, 2014 in Dallas, TX after a remarkably courageous six year struggle with cancer. She was born in Lohn, TX, on May 4th, 1921, a town founded by her great-grandfather in the 1890s. She was the daughter of Hulon William Huie and Anna (Lohn) Huie. She graduated from Lohn High School in 1938. Despite her academic achievements she was unable to continue her education due to the effects of the Great Depression. She was very proud of her work in management at the Office of Censorship during the war. After the war she married a young 8th Air Force Bombardier, named Vic Bloede, on March 11, 1945. Shortly thereafter they started their life together in New York, where Vic began his remarkable career in advertising, ably aided by Mickey. Her insight into people, personalities, and business helped propel Vic to the very top of the advertising world where he retired as chairman of Benton & Bowles, one of the largest international agencies at that time. He always said he couldn't have done it without her. Outside of advertising Mickey had a wide variety of interests including significant philanthropic pursuits and charitable activities. Her achievements included the founding of North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, and service on the executive board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Society, NYC, and work with American Cancer Society, among many others. In the social realm she served as President of the North Shore Southern Society. Also, Mickey was a member of a number of clubs: Sands Point (NY) Bath & Tennis, Manhasset Bay Yacht Club, Flower Hill Garden, Delray Dunes (FL) Golf and Country, and The Ocean Club of Florida. She was a member of the Community Reformed Church, Manhasset, NY, First Presbyterian Church, Delray Beach, FL, and later Highland Park Presbyterian Church, Dallas, TX. Throughout Mickey's life her intellect, wide ranging curiosity, keen wit, and fondness for a good debate were her hallmarks. It is worth noting because of her self-taught business acumen, her stock broker often consulted her. Mickey joked that he should be paying her. But beyond all her experiences and accomplishments clearly the most important thing in her life was the love of her family, by whom she will be dearly missed. Mickey was preceded in death by her husband of fifty four years, Victor G. Bloede. Survived by her three children, Dee Anna Smith Willis, Victor G. Bloede IV (Nancy), and Susan Lohn Quaid, and grandchildren Elizabeth Murphy, Amy Arata, Lindsay Carneal, Alexandra Quaid, Victor G. Bloede V, Forrest Bloede, Laura Bloede, sister-in-law Rama Huie, a dozen grandchildren, and many nieces and nephews. Memorial service February 24th, 4pm at Highland Park Presbyterian Church, Dallas."

2014-02-23T00:00:00Z,"LOW--Robert Allen, former New York City Council member and mayoral candidate, died in San Francisco on January 3, 2014 at the age of 94. Bob Low was born in Scarsdale, NY on June 6, 1919 and raised in New York City. He and his siblings, Stuart and Doris, were the children of Clarence Low, former Treasurer of the Democratic State Committee, and Madeleine Low (nee Mayer), daughter of Levy Mayer, one of America's most distinguished lawyers of the early twentieth century and co-founder of the global law firm Mayer Brown LLP. Bob attended Collegiate School and Choate. He was the youngest tennis player ever to compete in a National Tournament at the age of nine, as a teenager won numerous titles and captained the men's varsity tennis team at Stanford University. The day after his graduation from Stanford in 1941, Bob entered the US Navy and served in the Pacific during World War II. He became one of the youngest Lieutenant Commanders ever and won nine battle stars during his service, fighting at Iwo Jima, Midway and Okinawa. After the war, Bob moved to Washington, D.C. where he worked at the Saturday Review Magazine and graduated from George Washington University Law School. Public service was deeply ingrained in Bob and guided his professional life. He served in the State Department and worked for Senators Herbert Lehman and Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson (a lifelong friend and mentor), handling congressional relations. In 1952 he met Frances Delia Levison, one of the first female reporters for Time-Life Magazine, and they were married for 60 years until her death in 2012. Bob would often say that she was ""the most remarkable woman I ever knew"". In 1954 the couple moved back to New York City where Bob was appointed assistant to Mayor Robert Wagner. In 1961, Bob was elected to the New York City Council where he served two terms, representing the ""Silk Stockings"" District of Manhattan's Upper East Side, East Harlem and Yorkville--a true cross section of upper, lower and middle income families. He co-authored one of the first anti-pollution laws in the United States. Bob was subsequently featured in a New York Times article entitled ""Pollution's Nemesis"", detailing his critical role in the fight for clean air, which eventually led to the federal Clean Air Act. Bob was also chairman of New York City's Buildings Committee oversaw the first major revision of the building code controlling construction in almost seventy years. Bob disguised himself as a struggling writer and moved into a slum in East Harlem for a week to experience first-hand the living conditions. On another occasion, he moonlighted as a taxi driver to understand their challenges and advocated for higher wages. He studied Spanish in order to communicate and connect with the growing Puerto Rican population. In 1969 he entered the New York City race for mayor and president of city council and, although the campaigns were unsuccessful, he proved to be a progressive and political maverick. In the 1970's Bob was appointed Regional Administrator for the Environmental Protection Administration and then Regional Representative for the U.S. Department of Energy, overseeing the growth and development of the New York City water system, and policing air pollution laws, waste water and nuclear waste in the region. In 1980, Bob returned to civilian life and a small private law practice. Bob and Frances pursued their passion for people, food and wine, founding ""Le Cercle de Gastronomes"", a precursor to contemporary ""pop-up"" restaurants, at their house in Dutchess County, where Bob served French haute-cuisine paired with fine wines. He was a food critic and an editor for the French restaurant guidebook ""Gault et Millau"". In 2002, he and Frances moved to San Francisco to be with their sons and grandchildren. Bob is survived by his brother, Stuart, as well as his sons, Allen and Roger, six grandchildren, and several nieces and nephews. ""The Low Family asks that donations be made to The East Harlem School, an organization close to the Family's heart that serves low income students in New York City.""

2014-02-23T00:00:00Z,"BALDWIN--David M.,85, of Vero Beach, Florida and Short Hills, New Jersey, died peacefully at his Florida home on February 16, 2014. David will be remembered as a caring gentleman, a loving husband and father, a hugely accomplished New York real estate investor and a champion in athletics, philanthropy and community enrichment. David was born in East Orange, New Jersey in 1928, and was raised in South Orange, New Jersey. The memorable summers of his early years were at the Baldwin family compound at Northampton Shores of Southampton Township. He graduated from the Pingry School in 1947 before attending William and Mary College and graduating in 1951 from Lehigh University with a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration. David served his country in the counterintelligence unit of the army and in 1954 became a real estate broker with the former Charles F. Noyes Company, Inc. In 1964, at the age of 35, he became President and Chief Executive of the company, the youngest chief executive officer of a major national real estate company. He negotiated the sale of the Noyes Company, together with Brown, Harris and Stevens to Mr. Harry Helmsley. This vital partnership lead to responsibility with Mr. Helmsley for many notable properties in New York City and across the country. Among the many awards that recognized his personal accomplishments: in 1964 The Real Estate Board of New York's ""Young Man of the Year Award""; in 1966 its ""Most Ingenious Deal in Manhattan"" award, and in 1977 ""Man of the Year"" award from the Realty Foundation of New York. David exclusively represented many major corporations for their headquarters and staffing space. In 1994 following the winding down of the Helmsley portfolio, the David M. Baldwin Realty Company, Inc., was formed to specialize in the management of real estate in downtown Manhattan. David served on numerous real estate boards and foundations including the Real Estate Board of New York where he was governor and director and the Realty Foundation of New York. He was also the former Chairman and President of the Public Development Corporation of New York City. Throughout David's career, he instinctively sought to share his personal prosperity with many institutions and worthy initiatives in education, health care and the arts as a trustee and philanthropist. He was a founding member of the board of the Henry Stifel Spinal Cord Injury Foundation and ultimately a Vice-Chair of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation; at Lehigh, he enabled the renovation of The Taylor Gym and created an endowed scholarship fund; at the Pingry School, his generosity helped enable a new campus and he commissioned a monumental bronze replica of Dr. John Pingry; he served as a longstanding Chair of the Strang Cancer Prevention Center in New York and was a member of the board of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; he also served as Vice Chairman of The Riverside Theatre in Vero Beach and he generously supported Overlook Medical Center in Summit, New Jersey, the Indian River Medical Center in Vero Beach, Florida and The Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey, among other charities. David Baldwin was an accomplished athlete. At Pingry he was an all-star fullback and state ranked track star. Golf, however, was his keenest talent. He was a co-captain of the golf team at Lehigh and in 1954, he won the New Jersey State Open Championship and was runner-up in the National Lefthanders Golf Championship. He twice qualified for the U.S. Amateur and was also Club Champion at Baltusrol, Rock Spring and Essex County in New Jersey. In 2000, he was included in the ""Team of the Century"" by the New Jersey Star Ledger. He was a longstanding member of the United States Senior Golf Association. Club memberships included: in New Jersey Baltusrol Golf Club, where he was President, and The Short Hills Club; in Florida The John's Island Club, The Red Stick Golf Club and The Windsor Club in Vero Beach; and in New York Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, National Golf Links Club of America, The Meadow Club, The Bathing Corporation of Southampton, The University Club, and Doubles. Magic was David's fascination since early childhood. He assembled one of the most prominent personal collections of magic apparatus in the world. As a member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, David published biographies of the Great Raymond and of Del-Ray-America's Foremost Magician. He enabled the creation of a new headquarters for The Magic Circle in London, among the most exclusive clubs in the world. In 1977, David commissioned a bronze figure of David Deviant that has become a coveted award for distinguished magicians around the world. In 2006 as an Honorary Lifetime Member he was awarded the Magic Circle's Silver Wand for outstanding service. As a devoted husband and father, he is survived by his loving family which include his wife of thirty-seven years, Barbara M. Baldwin; three sons, David Jr. of Basking Ridge, New Jersey; Alfred of Port Orange, Florida; William of Sag Harbor, New York; two stepchildren, Martin ""Fritz"" Stein III of Landing, New Jersey, Kimberly Paige Fleming of Aspen, Colorado; three grandchildren Liam Fleming, Alexander and Paulina Stein and a twin brother Theodore Baldwin of Summit, New Jersey.

2014-02-23T00:00:00Z,"BLOEDE--Merle Huie. Mickey died February 18th, 2014 in Dallas, TX after a remarkably courageous six year struggle with cancer. She was born in Lohn, TX, on May 4th, 1921, a town founded by her great-grandfather in the 1890s. She was the daughter of Hulon William Huie and Anna (Lohn) Huie. She graduated from Lohn High School in 1938. Despite her academic achievements she was unable to continue her education due to the effects of the Great Depression. She was very proud of her work in management at the Office of Censorship during the war. After the war she married a young 8th Air Force Bombardier, named Vic Bloede, on March 11, 1945. Shortly thereafter they started their life together in New York, where Vic began his remarkable career in advertising, ably aided by Mickey. Her insight into people, personalities, and business helped propel Vic to the very top of the advertising world where he retired as chairman of Benton & Bowles, one of the largest international agencies at that time. He always said he couldn't have done it without her. Outside of advertising Mickey had a wide variety of interests including significant philanthropic pursuits and charitable activities. Her achievements included the founding of North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, and service on the executive board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Society, NYC, and work with American Cancer Society, among many others. In the social realm she served as President of the North Shore Southern Society. Also, Mickey was a member of a number of clubs: Sands Point (NY) Bath & Tennis, Manhasset Bay Yacht Club, Flower Hill Garden, Delray Dunes (FL) Golf and Country, and The Ocean Club of Florida. She was a member of the Community Reformed Church, Manhasset, NY, First Presbyterian Church, Delray Beach, FL, and later Highland Park Presbyterian Church, Dallas, TX. Throughout Mickey's life her intellect, wide ranging curiosity, keen wit, and fondness for a good debate were her hallmarks. It is worth noting because of her self-taught business acumen, her stock broker often consulted her. Mickey joked that he should be paying her. But beyond all her experiences and accomplishments clearly the most important thing in her life was the love of her family, by whom she will be dearly missed. Mickey was preceded in death by her husband of fifty four years, Victor G. Bloede. Survived by her three children, Dee Anna Smith Willis, Victor G. Bloede IV (Nancy), and Susan Lohn Quaid, and grandchildren Elizabeth Murphy, Amy Arata, Lindsay Carneal, Alexandra Quaid, Victor G. Bloede V, Forrest Bloede, Laura Bloede, sister-in-law Rama Huie, a dozen grandchildren, and many nieces and nephews. Memorial service February 24th, 4pm at Highland Park Presbyterian Church, Dallas."

Over the years, the Baldwin family donated close to a million dollars to safeguard the growth of the Reeve Foundation's research programs.

2014-02-24T00:00:00Z,"GREENMAN--Charles. Beloved husband, father, friend, attorney and advisor dies at 66. Charles Preston Greenman, a commercial litigator at the law firm of Troutman Sanders LLP, where he was a partner and defended numerous class actions relating to a wide variety of consumer and securities issues, died on Saturday, February 22, 2014, at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. He was respected both in and out of the courtroom as a force to be reckoned with. He served as Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs for the City of New York and Consumer Advocate for the City--charting new ground for aggressively protecting consumers' rights. Much beloved husband of Jane, father of Margot, Jaclyn and Danielle, proud grandfather of Seymour (Simi), father in-law of Caio and son-in-law of Isabelle, as well as adored brother, friend, uncle, and godfather, Charles was larger than life. Charles was a graduate of Albion College in Michigan where he played college football, Boston University, where he earned a master's degree in history and New York University School of Law, from which he graduated with honors. He served as Chairman of the Robinson-Patman Act Subcommittee of the New York State Bar Association and Chairman of the Committee on Consumer Affairs of the New York County Lawyers' Association. In addition, he taught Consumer Law at NYU School of Law for more than a dozen years and wrote numerous articles on consumer law issues for the New York Law Journal and similar publications. His outsized physique, spirit and uncanny intelligence made people cling to him, looking for protection and guidance in a perilous and sometimes uncontrollable world, a responsibility naturally bestowed upon him that he embraced and enjoyed. Charles loved to travel, play tennis, bicycle, and to be doted upon by his adoring wife and daughters, who will miss him more than he could have ever imagined. We are better human beings today for knowing Charles and being part of his life. He made his home a welcome haven to all comers--friends, family and all their friends and children--all of whom came to him to seek advice and companionship. His giant personality was contagious and inspiring. He made his mark on the world and leaves a gap that can never be filled. Funeral services will be held on Monday, February 24, 2014 at 11:45am at Riverside Chapel in New York City, and the family will be receiving guests at home from Monday early evening until Friday, February 28, 2014."

The devoted and enchanting husband of Mimi Sheraton for 58 delicious years, he loved and was beloved by his son Marc and daughter-in-law Caitlin Halligan and shared a special bond with his adored granddaughter, Anna, the greatest wonder his bright blue eyes ever gazed upon. The youngest of three siblings (all deceased), he was born in the Arthur Avenue section of the Bronx on April 12, 1918, to Giovannina and Francesco Falcone, immigrants from Puglia and Abruzzo who instilled a lasting love of the Italian language, opera, wine and all things pasta. A graduate of St. Martin of Tours and De Witt Clinton High School, Dick was a Morse Code radio operator during World War Il, landed at Gold Beach, spent 45 days in a foxhole during the Bulge and was in one of the first reconnaissance tanks to cross the Remagen Bridge before serving in a United States Army cultural exchange office in Paris where he was befriended by Gertrude Stein as one of her Gl's. A long-time executive at Gimbels where he began as a stockboy, he later was president of Garcia Ski and Tennis, the first to import Rossignol skis. As president of Cafco, NY, he represented Puiforcat silver and other fine French and Italian tableware. He retired to join Mimi in her work that was their pleasure, eating their way around the world and having many wonderful parties at home that were his pride. In addition to music, art, and walking New York City, he remained loyal to the Yankees and the Jets. Vigorous and fastidious, he was a wonderful dancer, a skilled and speedy driver, and a dedicated community activist. A hero for his time as celebrated by Lermontov, darling Richard will be missed forever by all who loved and enjoyed him. Death did not take him too young - only too young.

2014-02-28T00:00:00Z,"LOW--Robert Allen, former New York City Council member and mayoral candidate, died in San Francisco on January 3, 2014 at the age of 94. Bob Low was born in Scarsdale, NY on June 6, 1919 and raised in New York City. He and his siblings, Stuart and Doris, were the children of Clarence Low, former Treasurer of the Democratic State Committee, and Madeleine Low (nee Mayer), daughter of Levy Mayer, one of America's most distinguished lawyers of the early twentieth century and co-founder of the global law firm Mayer Brown LLP. Bob attended Collegiate School and Choate. He was the youngest tennis player ever to compete in a National Tournament at the age of nine, as a teenager won numerous titles and captained the men's varsity tennis team at Stanford University. The day after his graduation from Stanford in 1941, Bob entered the US Navy and served in the Pacific during World War II. He became one of the youngest Lieutenant Commanders ever and won nine battle stars during his service, fighting at Iwo Jima, Midway and Okinawa. After the war, Bob moved to Washington, D.C. where he worked at the Saturday Review Magazine and graduated from George Washington University Law School. Public service was deeply ingrained in Bob and guided his professional life. He served in the State Department and worked for Senators Herbert Lehman and Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson (a lifelong friend and mentor), handling congressional relations. In 1952 he met Frances Delia Levison, one of the first female reporters for Time-Life Magazine, and they were married for 60 years until her death in 2012. Bob would often say that she was ""the most remarkable woman I ever knew"". In 1954 the couple moved back to New York City where Bob was appointed assistant to Mayor Robert Wagner. In 1961, Bob was elected to the New York City Council where he served two terms, representing the ""Silk Stockings"" District of Manhattan's Upper East Side, East Harlem and Yorkville--a true cross section of upper, lower and middle income families. He co-authored one of the first anti-pollution laws in the United States. Bob was subsequently featured in a New York Times article entitled ""Pollution's Nemesis"", detailing his critical role in the fight for clean air, which eventually led to the federal Clean Air Act. Bob was also chairman of New York City's Buildings Committee oversaw the first major revision of the building code controlling construction in almost seventy years. Bob disguised himself as a struggling writer and moved into a slum in East Harlem for a week to experience first-hand the living conditions. On another occasion, he moonlighted as a taxi driver to understand their challenges and advocated for higher wages. He studied Spanish in order to communicate and connect with the growing Puerto Rican population. In 1969 he entered the New York City race for mayor and president of city council and, although the campaigns were unsuccessful, he proved to be a progressive and political maverick. In the 1970's Bob was appointed Regional Administrator for the Environmental Protection Administration and then Regional Representative for the U.S. Department of Energy, overseeing the growth and development of the New York City water system, and policing air pollution laws, waste water and nuclear waste in the region. In 1980, Bob returned to civilian life and a small private law practice. Bob and Frances pursued their passion for people, food and wine, founding ""Le Cercle de Gastronomes"", a precursor to contemporary ""pop-up"" restaurants, at their house in Dutchess County, where Bob served French haute-cuisine paired with fine wines. He was a food critic and an editor for the French restaurant guidebook ""Gault et Millau"". In 2002, he and Frances moved to San Francisco to be with their sons and grandchildren. Bob is survived by his brother, Stuart, as well as his sons, Allen and Roger, six grandchildren, and several nieces and nephews. ""The Low Family asks that donations be made to The East Harlem School, an organization close to the Family's heart that serves low income students in New York City."" A gathering of friends and family to celebrate Bob's life will be held at a later date."

2014-02-28T00:00:00Z,"BAHNA--Ralph M. 71, of Stamford, CT passed away peacefully surrounded by family on February 24, 2014. A global leader and entrepreneur in the travel industry, Ralph launched major innovations and businesses in hotels, ocean cruising and airline travel. He was the founder of the Club Quarters hotel chain; original investor and Chairman of Priceline.com; Chairman of Cunard Lines, Ltd.; and senior executive of Trans World Airlines. In both his business and private life, Ralph combined integrity and modesty with constant drive and passionate commitment to public service and the public good. Soft-spoken, with a gentle manner and an unfailingly cheerful sense of humor, Ralph commanded attention, respect and loyalty through the clarity, forcefulness and originality of his thinking and leadership. His business philosophy emphasized ""problem definition,"" which he said must always precede successful problem solutions. Born 1942 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Ralph received a BA from the University of Michigan '64, and MBA from UC Berkeley '66. At TWA he invented the idea of business class service (""Ambassador Service""), as well as curbside check-in. Credited with turning around the troubled airline, The New York Times acclaimed him a ""marketing genius"" while still in his twenties. At age 30, Ralph became the president of Cunard Lines. There he reinvented luxury cruise travel in the age of airline competition. He recast the company's flagship, the QE2, as a vacation destination by itself with the first-ever spas and computer centers on an ocean liner. Instead of competing with airlines, he partnered with them to offer Atlantic crossings via sea for one leg of the voyage and via supersonic Concorde flights for the return. Cunard became the world's largest buyer of supersonic airline seats. Cunard made luxury cruises accessible to middle-class consumers, quadrupling sales. Ralph became the first U.S.-born Chairman and CEO of Cunard Lines from 1980 to 1989. In 1990 Travel Trade Magazine named him ""Cruise Industry Leader of the Decade"". In the '90s Ralph created Club Quarters, a global chain of full service hotels for business travelers in major city centers. Club Quarters serves many Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 companies as members of this private organization. The chain's prime city-center locations include Rockefeller Center and the World Trade Center in NYC; Chicago River at Michigan Ave.; Embarcadero Center in San Francisco; Washington, DC (one block from the White House); and Trafalgar Square, London. Ralph was a pre-IPO investor in Priceline, the revolutionary, name-your-own-price web platform. He helped lead Priceline from its 1998 launch to an historic $1 billion in sales in 18 months. A board member, he became non-executive Chairman from 2004 until 2013. During his tenure, Priceline expanded worldwide, joined the S&P 500 and became the #"

His sister, Bridget, who married his Oxford friend James Collier and passed away in 2013, remained in England with his parents, and his two nieces Caroline and Lucy and their families live there. Walter served as a Trustee of the New School University for 39 years where he was instrumental in preserving the legacy of the University in Exile and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in 1996. As President of the Northside Center for Child Development, Board Member of the American Council on Germany, Chairman of the Martha's Vineyard Preservation Trust, Board Member of the St. Bernard's School, and Chairman of the Advisory Board of the World Policy Institute, Walter guided great institutions with wisdom and acumen. He had an elegant way about him, and delicate matters benefited from his respectful and diplomatic approach. During his last 10 years, The Frick Collection, where he served as a Trustee, becoming Vice Chair of the Board, was his great passion. He supported many exhibitions and scholarly endeavors at both the museum and the library, and he constantly enlarged the circle of supporters of the Frick through his sheer enthusiasm and love of the institution. In his many international business and volunteer activities, Walter built bridges between his three countries of citizenship, and he was honored with both an OBE from England and the Order of Merit from Germany. Walter had a keen intellect and wide range of interests in literature, music, and art. He authored ""Whence We Came, Where We Went"" (2002), a book tracing the history of his remarkable family back to its origins in Germany. He had a special passion for sailing, centered in Edgartown on Martha's Vineyard, where he and his family spent happy summers for nearly fifty years. He was always open to new things. He was at home everywhere, and exuded charm and a profound love of and pride in his family. Everyone who came into his world was touched by his generosity of spirit and love of life. His many friends will miss his conversational wit, kindness, and resilient spirit. Contributions in Walter's memory may be made to the Frick Collection frick.org/support/annual--fund and the New School www.newschool.edu/eberstadt There will be an open memorial service on Monday, March 3 at 11am at the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street."

2014-03-02T00:00:00Z,"ZECKENDORF--William Jr.,84, died on February 12, 2014 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Born in Manhattan on October 31, 1929, William Zeckendorf transformed the skyline of New York City and pioneered in changing the urban landscape of the city from Union Square to the Upper West Side. It is with deep love and admiration that we honor the life of our father and celebrate him as our devoted mentor. His brilliance in defining the future for neglected and decaying urban neighborhoods is legendary. When the Upper West Side was far distant from what it is today, William Zeckendorf built The Columbia at West 96th Street and Broadway, a development that undeniably helped to spur a West Side residential renaissance that continues today. He also built some of New York City's finest luxury developments including the Park Belvedere, Vanderbilt and Central Park Place. In midtown, William Zeckendorf built the elegant Four Seasons Hotel, and 4 Columbus Circle, a commercial building that stood alone, long before the successful destination that Columbus Circle has become. Downtown, Union Square could hardly be seen as the vibrant area that it is now. Zeckendorf Towers, envisioned by William Zeckendorf in the 1980's, led the way for the thriving 21st Century commercial and residential neighborhood that Union Square is today. The flourishing Eighth Avenue corridor is due in large measure to what William Zeckendorf saw and accomplished in his development of Worldwide Plaza, well before others followed with new developments now lining the Avenue. Worldwide Plaza was perhaps New York City's first genuine modern mixed use development combining corporate office headquarters with residential, cultural and theater facilities along with a mid-block public plaza. Other major projects included the Ronald Reagan Office Building in Washington, D.C. He was a man of great taste and culture, having served for over 50 years as an esteemed member of the Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin. His passion for the arts and education leave a lasting legacy from New York to Santa Fe. His quarter century of service to Long Island University preceded his deep commitment to philanthropy in his role as Founding Director of the Lensic Performing Arts Center in Santa Fe and his passionate support of The Santa Fe Opera, the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, Christus St. Vincent Hospital and the College of Santa Fe. William Zeckendorf contributed his great vision to the City of New York and its residents, who benefit enormously every day from his lifetime of achievements. He is survived by his wife, Nancy, his sister Susan Zeckendorf Nicholson, his sons Arthur Zeckendorf and William Lie Zeckendorf and two grandchildren. We are forever thankful and grateful for the wonderful lesson your life has been for us. A memorial service will be held in New York City at 4pm on March 5th. Please call 1-212-508-7273 for details. A memorial service will be held on March 29th in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Donations in his memory may be made to the Lensic Performing Arts Center, 211 West San Francisco Street, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87501. Arthur Zeckendorf William Lie Zeckendorf"

Charles Preston Greenman, a commercial litigator at the law firm of Troutman Sanders LLP, where he was a partner and defended numerous class actions relating to a wide variety of consumer and securities issues, died on Saturday, February 22, 2014, at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. He was respected both in and out of the courtroom as a force to be reckoned with. He served as Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs for the City of New York and Consumer Advocate for the City--charting new ground for aggressively protecting consumers' rights. Much beloved husband of Jane, father of Margot, Jaclyn and Danielle, proud grandfather of Seymour (Simi), father in-law of Caio and son-in-law of Isabelle, as well as adored brother, friend, uncle, and godfather, Charles was larger than life. Charles was a graduate of Albion College in Michigan where he played college football, Boston University, where he earned a master's degree in history and New York University School of Law, from which he graduated with honors. He served as Chairman of the Robinson-Patman Act Subcommittee of the New York State Bar Association and Chairman of the Committee on Consumer Affairs of the New York County Lawyers' Association. In addition, he taught Consumer Law at NYU School of Law for more than a dozen years and wrote numerous articles on consumer law issues for the New York Law Journal and similar publications. His outsized physique, spirit and uncanny intelligence made people cling to him, looking for protection and guidance in a perilous and sometimes uncontrollable world, a responsibility naturally bestowed upon him that he embraced and enjoyed. Charles loved to travel, play tennis, bicycle, and to be doted upon by his adoring wife and daughters, who will miss him more than he could have ever imagined. We are better human beings today for knowing Charles and being part of his life. He made his home a welcome haven to all comers--friends, family and all their friends and children--all of whom came to him to seek advice and companionship. His giant personality was contagious and inspiring. He made his mark on the world and leaves a gap that can never be filled.

Cherished father, beloved friend and lifelong scholar, he possessed a charming, vital and generous spirit as well as a driving intellect. Walter Sokel was born in Vienna, Austria in December, 1917. He fled soon after the Nazi Anschluss of Austria in 1938, and arrived in New York at the age of 21. On the basis of a letter of recommendation from the revered German author Thomas Mann, he received a scholarship from Rutgers University, and went on to become a prominent professor and scholar who bridged cultural boundaries, explaining the best of German and German-Jewish culture to an American audience. In a career spanning almost 50 years, Professor Sokel was connected to many top US, German and Austrian universities. He spent the last 20 years of his teaching career at the University of Virginia as Commonwealth Professor in the German and English Departments. Known for his work on 20th century European literature, German intellectual history, Expressionism, and in particular Kafka, two of Professor Sokel's books published in 1964 and 1966 were the first to put Kafka into his proper place as a giant of European literature. Among other honors, Professor Sokel was the recipient in 1998 of the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art. He was preceded in death by his wife of 41 years, Jacqueline P.

Professor Emeritus in Pharmacology, Long Island University, Arnold & Marie Schwartz School of Health Sciences (formerly Brooklyn College of Pharmacy) died in New York City at age 94. Dr. Kraus was born December 24, 1919 in New York City to Michael and Hannah Dushkind. She attended Hunter College BA ('40), Cornell University MA ('43) and the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, where she was granted a Ph.D. in Physiology in 1946. Entering a scientific and academic world where few women colleagues existed, Dr. Kraus held positions at Harlem Hospital, New York University College of Dentistry and Howard University Medical School before accepting a position at Brooklyn College of Pharmacy in 1957 where she remained for 25 years actively conducting research and teaching physiology and pharmacology.

A global leader and entrepreneur in the travel industry, Ralph launched major innovations and businesses in hotels, ocean cruising and airline travel. He was the founder of the Club Quarters hotel chain; original investor and Chairman of Priceline.com; Chairman of Cunard Lines, Ltd.; and senior executive of Trans World Airlines. In both his business and private life, Ralph combined integrity and modesty with constant drive and passionate commitment to public service and the public good. Soft-spoken, with a gentle manner and an unfailingly cheerful sense of humor, Ralph commanded attention, respect and loyalty through the clarity, forcefulness and originality of his thinking and leadership. His business philosophy emphasized ""problem definition,"" which he said must always precede successful problem solutions. Born 1942 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Ralph received a BA from the University of Michigan '64, and MBA from UC Berkeley '66. At TWA he invented the idea of business class service (""Ambassador Service""), as well as curbside check-in. Credited with turning around the troubled airline, The New York Times acclaimed him a ""marketing genius"" while still in his twenties. At age 30, Ralph became the president of Cunard Lines. There he reinvented luxury cruise travel in the age of airline competition. He recast the company's flagship, the QE2, as a vacation destination by itself with the first-ever spas and computer centers on an ocean liner. Instead of competing with airlines, he partnered with them to offer Atlantic crossings via sea for one leg of the voyage and via supersonic Concorde flights for the return. Cunard became the world's largest buyer of supersonic airline seats. Cunard made luxury cruises accessible to middle-class consumers, quadrupling sales. Ralph became the first U.S.-born Chairman and CEO of Cunard Lines from 1980 to 1989. In 1990 Travel Trade Magazine named him ""Cruise Industry Leader of the Decade"". In the '90s Ralph created Club Quarters, a global chain of full service hotels for business travelers in major city centers. Club Quarters serves many Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 companies as members of this private organization. The chain's prime city-center locations include Rockefeller Center and the World Trade Center in NYC; Chicago River at Michigan Ave.; Embarcadero Center in San Francisco; Washington, DC (one block from the White House); and Trafalgar Square, London. Ralph was a pre-IPO investor in Priceline, the revolutionary, name-your-own-price web platform. He helped lead Priceline from its 1998 launch to an historic $1 billion in sales in 18 months. A board member, he became non-executive Chairman from 2004 until 2013. During his tenure, Priceline expanded worldwide, joined the S&P 500 and became the #"

2014-03-03T00:00:00Z,"ROSS--Jesse Simmons, died unexpectedly at his home on January 11, 2014. He was thirty-six years old. A lifelong New Yorker, Jesse was born in Chelsea, raised in Tribeca, and happily returned to the city after graduating from Skidmore College with a degree in business. He centered his professional life around his love of fashion and hip-hop design. We see his unique tee shirts worn all around the city. Jesse was a natural athlete, an expert in tennis, skiing and basketball. As an adult, he developed a passion for mixed martial arts and was preparing to become an instructor in the field. Jesse was handsome and sweet, he had an amazing smile, warmth, natural intelligence and remarkable charm. Jesse's life dramatically changed in 2007 with the birth of his son. Damien, his ""mini-me"" and ""little ninja"" instantly became the center of his world and remained the focus until the day Jesse died. Jesse is survived by his adored son Damien Ross; his parents Dr. Bonnie Simmons and Roger Ross; his sister Julie Ross; step-father Bart Wenrich; and grandparents Dorothy Simmons and Itta and Donald Ross. He will also be missed by his aunts, Laurie and Susan Simmons, and uncles Carroll and Jeff; and by his cousins Jenna, Lena, and Grace.

One of the iconic leaders and characters of the maritime industry during the last half of the 20th century, Conrad, or Connie, as he was known to his many friends in the industry and elsewhere, is survived by Yolanda, his devoted wife of 58 years, and by his three children.

Her childhood was in Vienna where she and her parents resided at the same address with her Uncle Wilhelm Teitelbaum, Aunt Josephine and her beloved cousin Kurt. Austria and Vienna were the center of their universe. However, World War II changed everything. She and her mother found their way to Palestine while her father took refuge in the Shanghai Colony. They survived and resettled in Munich, however her cousin Kurt chose to take his family to America. Years later Trude would visit Kurt and his family on Long Island every summer. When travel was no longer possible, trips were taken to Munich, most recently for her 100th, 101st and 102nd birthdays. She died on March 1, 2014, with her only surviving relative Peter with her, in what turned out to be her last hours. Her long life was her victory over the tyranny of 1936-1945. With the lens of life upon her we ride on the shoulders of her history. Our love goes with her always as we honor her.

2014-03-07T00:00:00Z,"EVERHARD--Coenraad. Age 83, passed away on February 25, 2014, at his California retirement home after a brief battle with cancer. One of the iconic leaders and characters of the maritime industry during the last half of the 20th century, Conrad, or Connie, as he was known to his many friends in the industry and elsewhere, is survived by Yolanda, his devoted wife of 58 years, and by his three children. Born in 1930 in Holland, he witnessed first-hand the horrors of the Nazi invasion. He came to the US in the 1950s and graduated from Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. He then started his long and distinguished career in the maritime industry, first with United States Lines and then with the Massachusetts Port Authority where he served as Director General for Europe and Africa for eight years in Brussels, Belgium. In 1973, Conrad became CEO of Dart Container Line and OOCL (USA), Inc., a position that he held for more than a decade. In the 1980s, Conrad served as a founder of American Hawaii Cruises. In the 1990s, Conrad served as Chairman of Cho Yang Line (USA), Inc. Conrad retired in 1998. An adamant defender of the US Merchant Marine, Conrad was a much sought-after speaker on maritime subjects for both his knowledge and his humor. Conrad Everhard epitomized a generation of transportation leaders who were deeply concerned about the US Merchant Marine, the necessity of fair play in maritime transportation, the maintenance of stability in management/labor relations in that industry, and the role of the US in international commerce. His leadership and his humor will be sorely missed."

2014-03-08T00:00:00Z,"DILEO-KORFF--Virginia Katherine (nee Errera) beloved wife of Joseph Korff, both of Jupiter Florida, passed away peacefully at her home on March 6, 2014 with her family at her side after a three year courageous fight with cancer. She was 65. She was preceded in death by her father Salvatore Errera and her mother Mary Yuhoss Errera, and is survived by her husband, Joseph Korff, sister Phyllis Errera Punk, brother Nicholas Errera, sons Daniel Dileo and Phillip Christopher Dileo, granddaughters Aria Dileo, Olivia Dileo, and Giana Dileo, grandson Giancarlo Dileo, and stepchildren Christopher Korff, Penelope Korff, Jason Korff, Geoffrey Korff, and Mark Korff; many relatives in Sicily including cousin Enzo Errera who she considered her brother, Antonella Errera, Antonino Errera, Guissepe Cavasino, Bice Cerami, and dear friend Mimma Puma, as well as many loving friends in New York, Italy and the Jupiter area. Virginia was born in New York City on July 5, 1948 and attended catholic schools and the New School for Social Research where she became an expert in handwriting analysis. Her practice included forensic analysis and pre-employment screening. She owned the company Character Profiles and was a Certified Forensic Graphologist by the American Board of Forensic Examiners. She authored the book ""Exposing Drug Addiction in the Handwriting of Adolescents and Young Adults,"" and achieved level 5 in Homeland Security where, up to her illness, she was actively involved. She wrote children's books exclusively for her children with the titles ""Rob the Slob, Louise's Sneezes, Pat the Rat, Mister Tinkles Tickle, Tom Tom Meets Bullyboots, and Jake the Snake."" Virginia loved art and beauty. Her home in Jupiter and her yacht, The Virginia Mia, reflected the Italian Renaissance with commissioned frescoes depicting Greek mythology, Roman Centurions, and Egyptian scenes. Scenes in which, if she didn't like the original historically correct character, she directed the artist to insert one more friendly. Most of the furniture in her home is of her design including a wood sculpted Cleopatra bed for which Virginia holds a patent. Her taste for beauty and her eye for detail and her insistence that work is done precisely challenged the most practiced artisans. She owned the art gallery Le Pitit Musee d'Art in Palm Beach Gardens and commissioned many artists and sculptors. Virginia had a gentleness that was coupled with a Sicilian intensity. Her quick wit meant that there was laughter around her, and her approachable beauty convinced bystanders that they had seen her in a movie, on TV, or somewhere; and many asked for her autograph. Her husband Joseph, family, and friends are saddened beyond words at losing her, and we pray she is with God in heaven finding the peace and comfort the past three years have denied. We know that all is well with her soul, and that the constant prayers for her healing by friends and family during her three year battle will comfort her on her journey. If there were an Olympic Gold Medal for Love, Virginia Dileo-Korff would have won it. Visitation in Virginia's honor will be held on Monday, March 10, from 6pm to 8pm, and a service on Tuesday, March 11, at 10am at Aycock Riverside Funeral and Cremation Center, 1112 Military Trail, Jupiter, FL 33458.

A winner of many honors and awards, Stephen was also an author of over 80 scientific papers and holder of several patents. A more comprehensive list of his accomplishments can be found at StephenUdem.com.

A longtime member of our Women's Division and one of its most ardent supporters, she was a dynamic and inspirational leader. Over the years, she served as the division's president and as an executive vice president, and on the executive committee of its New York chapter's board. In 2005, the Women's Division honored her with its highest accolade, the Lizette H. Sarnoff Award for Volunteer Service. A trained actress and award-winning film producer, Rita contributed her time, passion and creativity to making nearly 20 films for Einstein that would help tell the College of Medicine's story, highlight the importance of medical research and inspire others to become involved. Her documentary about our Children's Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center received a prestigious Clarion award. Rita joined Einstein's Board of Overseers in 1983 and was a vibrant, creative and active member. Along with Philip, she was recognized by the College of Medicine for her extraordinary service with both its Humanitarian and Lifetime Achievement awards, and by Yeshiva University with an honorary doctorate. Tireless champions of Einstein and its mission to improve human health, this remarkable couple used their many talents to help the College of Medicine grow and flourish; our Department of Communications and Public Affairs is named in their honor and has benefited greatly from their support and vision. We will miss Rita's elegant and spirited presence and extend our heartfelt sympathy to Phyllis, Michael, Robert, Richard, Stephanie and the entire family. Yeshiva University Richard M.

Sadly Rita was predeceased by her daughter Wendy Landes on March 14, 2013 and her beloved husband Philip on January 19, 2014. Born in Pittsburgh, PA. to Anne and Max Pochapin, Rita excelled in the theatre arts. After receiving the Best Actress Award from Great Neck High School, Rita went on to study with Sanford Meisner, Martha Graham and Lee Strassberg at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Upon graduation she was invited by Rabbi Steven Wise to dramatize ""Behold The Jew"", the plight for a Jewish National Homeland, at The World Jewish Congress. This became the platform for her life of volunteerism. She created ""Theatre for a Cause"", which presented dramatizations in support of civic, philanthropic and humanitarian causes. Guidance Center, UJA, National Conference of Christians and Jews, Union of American Hebrew Congregations, United Way, New Rochelle Hospital, American Jewish Committee, Family Service of Westchester, Jewish Braille Institute and Temple Israel of New Rochelle, were among the organizations Rita and Philip supported. Highlights: In 1973 Rita and Rabbi Amiel Wohl of Temple Israel, began broadcasting a radio program for High Holy Days and Sabbaths to those who could not physically attend worship services. That program continues, bringing comfort to the homebound of all faiths. Rita and Philip devoted a large portion of their time and energy to The Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Rita used her talents to create over 20 films, telling the college of medicine's story and highlighting the importance of medical research. Rita became a member of the Board of Overseers in 1983.

Known as Rudy, she was born on September 11, 1924 in Chicago, one of five daughters of James Ewing Bennett and Mary Mable Dwyer. She attended the Girls' Latin School in Chicago and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College with a B.A. in 1946. Rudy served as a volunteer ambulance driver for the Red Cross Motor Corps in Chicago during World War II. She volunteered as a nurse's aide during and after college. A long term member of The Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, New York, New York, and St. John's Episcopal Church, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, Rudy was a person of strong values and a leader in ethics. Rudy studied at Columbia University Teacher's College towards a Master's degree in Teaching and taught English and American History for 10 years at The Lenox School in Manhattan. She subsequently earned her Juris Doctor from New York Law School in 1981, and was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1982 at the age of 57. She worked as an assistant in the Law Department at the New York County Surrogate's Court, and later at a law firm and also volunteered in the field of environmental law.

She was a long term member of the Colony Club, The New York Junior League, the Cold Spring Harbor Beach Club and The Colonial Dames of America.

She was interviewed by Dan Rather on CBS 60 Minutes II, and by others on television, on the topic of the Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco International Ltd. trial, in which she was involved. She advocated that as there was not sufficient evidence in the initial trial to establish the defendant's guilt, as she saw it, the presumption of innocence must prevail. Rudy was an optimist and an idealist; a person of great fortitude and original thought. Always supportive of her children and grandchildren, and an extremely warm and devoted mother, she set an example of determination and creative solutions in the face of adversity. Rudy is survived by her two children, Jennifer Jordan McCall and William Winston Jordan, a daughter-in-law, Denise A.

2014-03-13T00:00:00Z,"SIVE--David, (1922-2014) Sive, Paget & Riesel mourns the passing of our founding partner, David Sive. David was a great friend to his colleagues, an exceptional litigator, and a loving husband, father, and grandfather. As an intellectual and spiritual leader of the modern environmental law movement, he devoted his energies and passion to protecting the environment. Our hearts go out to David's family in this difficult time. A veteran of World War II, David fought in the Battle of the Bulge. After graduating from Columbia Law School in 1948, he emerged as an authority on administrative law. However, his love of the wilderness soon led him into the then-nascent field of environmental law. He quickly became an authority in this new field, and was often referred to as the father of modern environmental law. His sustained success in the courtroom over decades established vitally important precedents for later generations of environmental lawyers. David was one of the first lawyers to bring litigation effectuating the ""forever wild"" provisions of the New York State Constitution, and litigated a number of cases protecting the environment in his beloved Adirondack and Catskill Mountains. In the 1960's, he played a leading role in the administrative and judicial proceedings that prevented the construction of a power plant on Storm King Mountain along the Hudson River, and helped to establish aesthetics as a recognized environmental value. In subsequent decades David litigated numerous important environmental cases. He prevented the construction of the proposed Hudson River Expressway (a precursor of the ill-fated Westway Project). He challenged up to the U.S. Supreme Court the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's testing of atomic weapons off Alaska's Amchitka Island, and litigated the principal case establishing that the military is subject to the National Environmental Policy Act. In a landmark case decided by the New York Court of Appeals, David established that the preservation of wilderness areas for the benefit of the public serves charitable, educational, and moral purposes and entitles nature preserves to the tax-exempt status that is essential to their survival. David was proud of his role as a teacher, introducing generations of young lawyers to the emerging field of environmental law, both as a member of the adjunct faculty of Columbia and Pace Law Schools, and as the founder of several continuing legal education courses for the Environmental Law Institute and the American Law Institute- American Bar Association. David's lectures and written scholarship, including an environmental column in the National Law Journal and articles in numerous law reviews, helped to shape the field of environmental law. David also played a critical role in the creation of the Environmental Law Institute, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and other prominent national environmental organizations, as well as scores of regional and local entities. His legacy is permanently embedded in innumerable precedent-setting cases. But to those who knew David well and worked with him closely, his gentle way and kind soul will be missed most of all. We will miss David greatly."

2014-03-13T00:00:00Z,"JORDAN--Ruth Bennett, died on March 8, 2014, peacefully in New York City. Known as Rudy, she was born on September 11, 1924 in Chicago, one of five daughters of James Ewing Bennett and Mary Mable Dwyer. She attended the Girls' Latin School in Chicago and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College with a B.A. in 1946. Rudy served as a volunteer ambulance driver for the Red Cross Motor Corps in Chicago during World War II. She volunteered as a nurse's aide during and after college. A long term member of The Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, New York, New York, and St. John's Episcopal Church, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, Rudy was a person of strong values and a leader in ethics. Rudy studied at Columbia University Teacher's College towards a Master's degree in Teaching and taught English and American History for 10 years at The Lenox School in Manhattan. She subsequently earned her Juris Doctor from New York Law School in 1981, and was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1982 at the age of 57. She worked as an assistant in the Law Department at the New York County Surrogate's Court, and later at a law firm and also volunteered in the field of environmental law. Rudy was a direct descendant of Thomas Soule and Richard Warren of the Mayflower. She was a long term member of the Colony Club, The New York Junior League, the Cold Spring Harbor Beach Club and The Colonial Dames of America. She was a champion bridge player, representing the bridge team for the Colony Club for many years. She was interviewed by Dan Rather on CBS 60 Minutes II, and by others on television, on the topic of the Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco International Ltd. trial, in which she was involved as the sole ""hold out"" juror against conviction. She advocated that as there was not sufficient evidence in the initial trial to establish the defendant's guilt, as she saw it, the presumption of innocence must prevail. Rudy was an optimist and an idealist; a person of great fortitude and original thought. Always supportive of her children and grandchildren, and an extremely warm and devoted mother, she set an example of determination and creative solutions in the face of adversity. Rudy is survived by her two children, Jennifer Jordan McCall and William Winston Jordan, a daughter-in-law, Denise A. Walter, three grandchildren, Caroline Debevoise Clark, Hillary Sage Clark and Samantha Marie Jordan, and by a sister, Joan Bennett Gordon of Glenview, Illinois. A Memorial Service will be held at 10:30am on Saturday, March 15 at St. John's Episcopal Church, Cold Spring Harbor, New York."

Born in Pittsburgh, PA. to Anne and Max Pochapin, Rita excelled in the theatre arts. After receiving the Best Actress Award from Great Neck High School, Rita went on to study with Sanford Meisner, Martha Graham and Lee Strassberg at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Upon graduation she was invited by Rabbi Steven Wise to dramatize ""Behold The Jew"", the plight for a Jewish National Homeland, at The World Jewish Congress. This became the platform for her life of volunteerism. She created ""Theatre for a Cause"", which presented dramatizations in support of civic, philanthropic and humanitarian causes. Guidance Center, UJA, National Conference of Christians and Jews, Union of American Hebrew Congregations, United Way, New Rochelle Hospital, American Jewish Committee, Family Service of Westchester, Jewish Braille Institute and Temple Israel of New Rochelle, were among the organizations Rita and Philip supported. Highlights: In 1973 Rita and Rabbi Amiel Wohl of Temple Israel, began broadcasting a radio program for High Holy Days and Sabbaths to those who could not physically attend worship services. That program continues, bringing comfort to the homebound of all faiths. Rita and Philip devoted a large portion of their time and energy to The Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Rita used her talents to create over 20 films, telling the college of medicine's story and highlighting the importance of medical research. Rita became a member of the Board of Overseers in 1983. In 2000 Rita received an Honorary Doctorate from Yeshiva University. In 2005 The Women's Division honored her with its highest accolade, The Lizette H. Sarnoff Award for Volunteer Service. Along with Philip, Einstein bestowed upon them their Humanitarian and Lifetime Achievement Awards. Rita fell in love with and married Philip Rosen in 1947. They built their home and raised their family on the shores of the Long Island Sound in New Rochelle, NY where they lived until this day. As important as her volunteerism became, nothing was more important to Rita than her family. The tradition of her holiday dinners with children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins and friends were legendary, spanning more than three generations. Rita was a strong, loving and fiercely dedicated matriarch. She celebrated life to the fullest, savoring each moment, turning every occasion into something special. She will be greatly missed.

Hal once said, ""The real art is the art of life - the art of living.""

He spent the last 15 years recording from his home studio at the horse farm he shared with his beloved wife, Ruth, in Northern Virginia. Hal was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2010, and thanks to his treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital's Pancreatic Cancer Multidisciplinary Clinic and additional support from The Block Center for Integrative Cancer Treatment, he and his family were able to enjoy another four years of his exquisite life.

2014-03-19T00:00:00Z,"DENIHAN--Charles Tully. May 24, 1985 to March 16, 2014, 28, of New York City, passed away suddenly on Sunday evening, March 16, 2014. Charlie was the loving son of Benjamin and Barbara Denihan; brother of Kate and Tully Denihan and Chrissy Denihan O'Donovan; brother-in-law to Kevin O'Donovan; godfather to Bud O'Donovan, and loving uncle, as well as friend to all. Charlie was a third generation member of the family's hotel investment and management company, Denihan Hospitality Group, founded by his grandfather Benjamin J. ""Bud"" Denihan in New York City in 1963. Although the youngest of four siblings, Charlie had an extraordinary bond with his slightly older, special needs brother Tully, and was a 'big' brother to him from the moment he was born. Charlie grew up in Manhattan where he attended St. David's School, and later graduated from Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Mass. where as both a peer counselor and cheerleader he became known for his larger-than-life personality, a trait that followed him through the rest of his life. Charlie earned his Bachelor of Science degree from the Cornell School of Hotel Administration with a concentration in Finance, Accounting and Real Estate. In addition to his involvement in the family business, Charlie was passionate about music, musical artists and technology. He took an avid role in various start-up technology and ventures, as a founder of Silver Lake to Soho, a cross-platform digital promotion and tour operator for emerging musical artists and as CO-CEO of Vokoder FM, a music web application. Charlie lived life to the fullest and found a way to look at the brightest side of everything. He believed in the possibilities of the dreams of those he knew and loved as fervently as he believed in his own. Those who met Charlie consistently walked away moved by his presence, knowing well that he was a friend who would always be there when it really counted. Charlie's zest for life was contagious and he could light up a room with his smile. Handsome, genuine, funny and magnetic, he inherited his family's generosity, and as many say, would gladly give anyone the shirt off his back. His philanthropic interests included The Benedictine Foundation, The Miami Project, Operation Smile and The Fresh Air Fund. In repose at Frank Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue, New York, NY, 10028, Friday March 21 from 2-5pm and 7-9pm. Mass of Christian Burial will be held at St. Ignatius Loyola, 980 Park Avenue, New York, NY, 10028, Saturday at 9:30am. The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to The Benedictine Foundation, 14299 Benedictine Lane, Ridgley, MD, 21660; foundation@ benedictineschool.org"

2014-03-19T00:00:00Z,"LANDAU--Gerald Leonard, 95. Loving husband of 67 years of Miriam Landau, proud father of Jonathan Landau, and wife Barbara, David Landau, and wife Gretchen, loving grandfather to Kate Downey Landau, and Charles Downey Landau, and Jennifer Yankeliovich, and, in the last four months of his life, great- grandfather to Gerald Yankeliovich Landau. The second of four children, he was predeceased by his older brother Herb, younger brother Martin, and younger sister Bernice. Born in 1919, in his early years he developed a passionate interest in jazz and baseball. Among his many heroes were Louis Armstrong, whose music he was still listening to just last month, and Willie Mays. During World War II he served as a paratrooper, and made 22 jumps during the war. After the war, he attended Brooklyn College and became a school teacher and historian until he was blacklisted by the New York City school system in 1952 for his political activities. In 1959, he began a second career when he joined the new Acoustic Research company and went on to be become its Vice President before retiring. Gerald was a lifetime student of language and always spoke with precision and clarity. He was an intellectual who followed the news and history of the world around him with great care and understanding. He had a talent for inventing children's stories and his tales about ""Bruin the Bear"" are considered classics, especially by his grandchildren. A charming and handsome man, with a twinkle in his eyes, a relaxed and friendly manner, he was always a natural, interesting, and witty conversationalist. Over the course of his 95 years, the most important thing to him was the love he shared with Miriam, Jonathan, Barbara, David, Gretchen, Kate, Charles, and young Gerald--his family, who loved him with all their heart. Plans for a memorial will be announced at a later date. Donations may be made to Doctors Without Borders."

2014-03-22T00:00:00Z,"STRAUSS--Robert P. Longtime Manalapan, Florida resident, Pep Boys executive and scion, renowned arbitrageur, and beloved father and husband Robert Perry Strauss passed away peacefully on March 20th, at his home surrounded by family. He was 82. Born in Philadelphia, Robert ""Bob"" was raised in Merion, PA, where he was a graduate of the Episcopal Academy. An outstanding athlete Robert led Episcopal in Varsity basketball and alone, was chosen All-Philadelphia in years 1948 and 1949, awarding him honor athletic scholarships to both Brown and Duke University. He chose Duke where he was coached by the legendary Red Auerbach, and quickly named ""All Southern Conference"" during his Freshman year. During college Bob helped his father, Maurice ""Moe"" Strauss, Founder of Pep Boys Auto Stores - Manny, Moe and Jack move the family out to California, where they purchased the famed ""Vistra Bel-Air"", a former 60 acre estate in Bel Air. Known for his ""Cary Grant"" strikingly handsome good looks, sharp wit, romantic charm and distinguished reserve, it was in Los Angeles where after a brief audition, Robert was discovered for his stage acting ability also and was cast in the starring role of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"". In 1952 he met dancer/movie and television actress and co-star of Walt Disney's ""Mark of Zorro"" Eugenia (Popova) Paul during a celebrity party at the Hollywood Bowl. They were married in 1958, until her death in 2010. Robert and Eugenia relocated to Dallas, Texas where Bob became regional Vice President for Pep Boys and in 1970 returned to Philadelphia again, making Bryn Mawr his home to join Pep Boys' board of directors and serve as an executive at company headquarters for the next 30 years. In the mid-1980s when financial leveraging was all the rage, Robert's conservative business philosophy, like that of his father's, inspired Bob to sell his share of company stock at its all time high and leave Pep Boys to foray into his own capital investment management, namely risk arbitrage wherein he amassed a greater fortune, revered and respected by those known to him in the industry. His oldest daughter Kimberly explains: ""Even those with whom he clashed, admired and respected him both personally and professionally. He was strong, resolute and steadfast, and also very sweet. He let his business acumen speak for itself and despite his accomplishments my father was never too proud, nor pretentious. Instead he was always genuine and sincere. He had values; he personified nobility."" In 1985 he and Eugenia retired to Boca Raton, Florida and in 1987 they purchased the magnificent c.1925 ocean side estate ""Mia Encantada"" in Manalapan, Florida. A long time, ardent philanthropist, both personally and through his trusteeship of the national Strauss Foundation, Robert's charitable contributions were broad and vast. Most recently he and Eugenia were best known for their leadership contributions to Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, Miami City Ballet, Palm Beach Opera, and the Jewish Federation in Palm Beach County. Robert is survived by his children: Kimberly V. Strauss of New York, NY, Wendy L. Strauss, of Winnetka, IL, Baron K. Strauss, of Calabasas, CA, and grandchildren: George, Ryan and Brody Dowd."
2014-03-22T00:00:00Z,"WEINBERG--Robert S. Son of Norman and Beatrice Weinberg, born in New York City on November 17 1927, died in St. Louis, Missouri on February 27, 2014 from an acute myocardial infarction. Robert served as a Naval Aviator during WWII, earned a DFC as an Air Force fighter pilot during the Korean War, and worked as an economist for the DoD throughout the Cold War. From 1951-1953 he was assigned to Project SCOOP where he helped George Dantzig's team pioneer the use of high speed computers in large scale national security planning problems. From 1953-1956 he worked for the Naval Warfare Analysis Group and was the first economist on a team of MIT analysts that helped the Chief of Naval Operations formulate U.S. military needs on both a nuclear and conventional level. In 1956, Robert joined IBM and, over ten years, became IBM's chief management scientist. During this period he wrote the first paper ever published to discuss an actual integrated corporate planning model and one of the first books to apply mathematical models to marketing problems. In 1966 Robert joined Anheuser-Busch as the VP of Corporate Planning. He established AB's long term strategic planning programs, built the first three generations of their planning models, and spearheaded key strategic shifts. His efforts are credited by Beer Marketers Insights editor Ben Steinman for helping AB lead beer industry growth for decades. August Busch III, was quoted by Mr. Steinman as saying that Bob was a ""Good friend with a great mind"". Pat Stokes, told Mr. Steinman that ""Bob came to AB from IBM at a time when the company was moving from family management to a more professional management structure. He brought along many innovations, a fresh way of thinking and was responsible for recruiting many of AB's future leaders. In his short time with AB Bob made a major impact"". During the following 34 years, Robert became the foremost analyst for the brewing industry. Beer industry economist Lester Jones said ""There are literally decades of research and insights from Bob in the Beer Institute archivesHis work on the beer industry will be a must have...for a long time to come"". Although Robert made a living as an applied economist, his true vocation was as a student, a teacher, and a mentor. He studied philosophy, mathematics, physics, economics, and corporate strategy. Every room of his home was filled with books. He taught at the university level on a part time basis throughout his career, and eventually took a permanent position as a Professor of Marketing and Management at Washington University. He enjoyed adopting bright young minds, and delighted in watching them grow into powerful intellects. His stories and jokes captured our imaginations and inspired us to pursue greatness. Robert was preceded in death by his wife Lois Nelson Weinberg. Robert is survived by a community of acolytes who he lovingly adopted, and a body of intellectual work that will endure for generations. He will be remembered for his stories, wisdom, generosity, and massive book collection. A memorial service is scheduled for Saturday, May 3, 2014 at Washington University in St. Louis.

2014-03-23T00:00:00Z,"HAVEMEYER--Horace, III, died March 19, 2014, in his home in New York City of complications from CIDP, a chronic neurological disorder that rendered him quadriplegic in mid-2011. He was 72. He is survived by his beloved and loving wife Eugenie Cowan Havemeyer, his mother Rosalind E. Havemeyer, his siblings Rosalind H. Roosevelt, William E. Havemeyer, and Christian Havemeyer, and his uncle Harry W. Havemeyer. He was a lifelong sailor and a watercolorist. Horace achieved his life-long goal of being a publisher. His trajectory lead from his childhood on a family farm in Dix Hills, Long Island, where sailing became a passion, and the family summer home in Islip designed by Grosvenor Atterbury. He went to East Woods School on Long Island, graduated from Pomfret School and from Hobart and William Smith Colleges, in Geneva, New York, in 1964. He served on the Hobart Board of Trustees from 1980-85 and 1991-97. After college, as the fourth generation of eldest sons, he joined the family business, the National Sugar Refining Company; he began in the Philadelphia factory, learning the chemical processes. When the family business was sold in 1969, he moved to New York City and was Production Planning Supervisor at Doubleday book publishers for a decade. There he learned the editorial and business operations of book publishing and nurtured his thirst for learning, from medieval to contemporary, which he stored in his immense memory bank. Courses at the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies led to his working for Skyline, the IAUS journal, until it closed. In 1981, he founded Bellerophon Publications and served as Publisher of Metropolis magazine and of Metropolis Books, a joint venture with DAP since 2002. From its first issue, Metropolis was in the vanguard of architecture and design, encompassing environmental sustainability, and ranging from preservation to contemporary planning. Horace's intellectual and practical curiosity framed his vision for Metropolis: to posit and answer the questions what, why, how, and to focus on the collaborations and challenges involved in any project. Its editorial perspective has been described as ""the conscience"" of the field. The magazine's reach now includes educational tours led by long-time Editor-in-Chief now Publisher - Susan S. Szenasy. Its competitions, such as Next Generation, discover new talent and new resources, such as the 2013 focus on low-cost solutions for the disabled. Through Metropolis, Horace was instrumental in developing the annual International Contemporary Furniture Fair, held each May at the Javits Center, and included a vanguard lecture series sponsored by Metropolis. In 2006 the American Society of Interior Designers, New York Metro Chapter, created the Horace Havemeyer III Award to honor his on-going dedication to the design community. Its annual State of Design lectures provide a platform for an open, constructive dialogue on what shapes 21st century design. In December 2006, Horace and Susan were awarded honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degrees by the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. In 2007 Horace, Susan and Metropolis received the August Heckscher Award from CIVITAS ""for their twenty-five years pursuing enlightened and intelligent documentation of life in urban America, especially New York City"". In 2009 the American Institute of Architects awarded Horace, in behalf of Metropolis magazine, the Institute Honor for Collaborative Achievement, ""reaching a broad cross-section of design disciplines, touching all elements of design excellence, it speaks to elemental and contextual innovation, including, but not limited to ecological insight, livability, and community development; in short, the spectrum of all goals of the architectural profession."" He was a co-founder and director of Exploring the Metropolis, Inc., a non-profit organization led by his wife Eugenie Cowan, focused on the built environment, specifically solving workspace issues facing New York's performing arts and cultural communities. A memorial service will be held on May 2, 2014, at 11:00am at St. James' Church. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions in Horace's memory be made to Exploring the Metropolis, Inc., 61 West 23rd Street, New York 10010, or to Hospital for Special Surgery: ALS Research c/o Dr. Dale J.

A highly-regarded scholar and teacher, he joined the University of Chicago faculty in 1967 and taught there until his death. He received his PhD from Harvard in 1972, studying with the analytic philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine. Cohen's own scholarly interests were wide-ranging; he published four books and more than sixty scholarly articles, focusing most recently on how we use art, narrative, and even sports and jokes to create empathy and connection (""Becoming the Other,"" and ""Thinking of Others"" are two recent titles). His many awards include the Quantrell, the University of Chicago's award for excellence in teaching. His elegant thinking and writing brought him the Pushcart Prize in 1991 for ""There Are No Ties at First Base."" His role in Chicago's famous annual ""Latke-Hamantash Debate"" led to the 2006 book, The Great Latke-Hamantash Debate, in which Cohen both explicates and sends up analytic philosophy. Famous as a joke teller, his 1999 book, Jokes: Philosophical Thought on Joking Matters, explored the role of humor in creating intimacy and community.

2014-03-23T00:00:00Z,"BELKNAP--Robert Lamont. Professor Emeritus of Slavic Languages and Literatures at Columbia University, died on March 17 after a month of fighting idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Fortunately, he experienced no pain or discomfort, so he retained his signature smile, genial personality, and brilliant mind to the end. Bob has long figured as an internationally renowned Dostoevsky scholar, especially for his monumental studies of The Brothers Karamazov. Remarkable for the depth, breadth, and nuance of his knowledge, Bob wrote dozens of articles that elucidated diverse corners of 18th- and 19th-century Russian literature. His work always reflected a passionate, comparative quality, and he possessed encyclopedic knowledge of European ancient and modern literature. His ability to relate one work of literature to another will be amply demonstrated in his last book, Literary Plots (forthcoming from Columbia University Press). His was a beautiful, labyrinthine mind. Professor Belknap was magisterial--and fun--in the classroom. The intellectual excitement he generated among students was legendary. Figuratively and in reality, at 6'5"", he was a towering presence. At Columbia for over fifty years, he championed the teaching of Literature Humanities and co-authored a book on the subject, Tradition and Innovation: General Education and the Reintegration of the University. Just last month, his colleagues and graduate students honored him with a festschrift, Teaching Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature: Essays in Honor of Robert L. Belknap. Bob was a good citizen of the many communities to which he belonged. He was chairman of the board at the Brearley School, which his daughters attended, and he served as president of the Giles Whiting Foundation. At Columbia, among other posts, he was department chair, director of the Harriman Institute, and acting dean of the College. His last position, Chair of the University Seminars, combined his zeal for interdisciplinary studies with his ability to get people to work together harmoniously, even if they warmly despised each other. Bob, a native New Yorker, was born on December 23, 1929. He was educated at the Buckley School, Philips Exeter Academy, and Princeton University, from which he graduated summa cum laude in 1951. After serving in the U.S. Army, he completed his doctorate at Columbia in 1960 and also studied at the University of Paris and Leningrad State University. During summers, Bob loved the ongoing project of building his house on Cliff Island, Maine. There was a sense of nobility about Bob, and perhaps his best achievement was never to have faltered at being honest, fair, wise, of good will and good cheer and thoroughly decent. He was the perfect gentleman. His survivors include: his wife, Cynthia Hyla Whittaker, a Russian historian; his daughters from his previous marriage, Lydia Duff of Baltimore, Ellen Belknap of Portland, Maine, and Abigail Krueger of Boston; his stepchildren, Erica Whittaker of Windsor, England and Andrew Whittaker of New York; and his sisters, Louise Belknap Carter of New Haven and Barbara Belknap of New York. A memorial service will be held at St. Paul's Chapel, Columbia University, on September 12 at 2pm."

As a member of the bylaws committee of the New York State Nurses Association, she was an acknowledged leader in the development and revision of by-laws for nursing organizations. Sylvia was an active member and leader for sixty years of The Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, United Methodist, in Manhattan. In the 1970s she helped found there both the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, now the largest emergency food program in New York City and a pioneering Meals on Wheels Program now serving 500 seniors six days a week. She was also instrumental in founding the church's homeless shelter for women and after-school tutoring program. Sylvia was a national leader in the United Methodist denomination in civil rights, gay rights and interfaith work. She will be missed by all whose professional and personal lives were touched by her brilliance and generosity of spirit. Donations in her memory may be sent to The Alumnae Association, The Mount Sinai Hospital School of Nursing, 1 Gustave Levy Place, P.O. Box 1143, New York, NY 10029-6574; and The Church of St. Andrew, United Methodist, 263 West 86th Street, New York, NY 10024. A memorial service will be held at Mount Sinai Medical Center at a future date. A memorial service will be held at the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew on May 10 at 5pm.
