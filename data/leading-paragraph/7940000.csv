2016-06-16T00:00:00Z,"SILVERMAN--Gilbert. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the death of Gilbert Silverman. A longstanding member of the Museum's Trustee Committee on Archives, Library, and Research, Gilbert, along with his wife Lila, began collecting works by Fluxus artists in 1978. In 2008 the Museum acquired, through the generosity of Gilbert and Lila, the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection and Archives, widely considered the largest and most important collection of its kind in the world. Assembled in Detroit over three decades by the Silvermans, the collection comprises over 4,000 works in mediums ranging from printed ephemera, multiples, drawings, and sculptural objects, to photographs and film. The Silverman Collection also incorporates an archival and library component of over 5,500 files containing artists' correspondence, notebooks and scrapbooks, and publications, as well as documents and photographs related to Fluxus performances and events from the 1960s to the 1990s. Gilbert and Lila's collecting was iconoclastic, as much as the movement of Fluxus was itself. With a love of experimentation, chance operation and unceasing inventiveness, Gilbert's vision embraced the lives of artists whose works he collected, as much as the works themselves. We extend our deepest sympathies to Lila, a member of the Museum's Trustee Committee on Archives, Library, and Research, his children, and their families.

Jane was a wife, mother, friend and educator of boundless love, devotion and generosity.

In appearance, Jane personified elegance, but her legacy consists of the grace, magnanimity and nobility of spirit that she exemplified, and by which her family and countless friends will remember her.

2016-06-17T00:00:00Z,"HODGE--Jerrick, an ardent advocate for people in recovery whose positive energy and kindness made him a much loved staple at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and throughout the recovery community, died on June 5 at his home in Canaan, CT. He was 61. The cause was lung cancer. His death was announced by Mountainside Treatment Center, where he had worked for more than 15 years. One of Mountainside's first clients, Mr. Hodge joined the treatment center's staff in 1998. A key, informal position that Mr. Hodge held was as the Ambassador of Mountainside. Tasked with handing out coins to celebrants at the Friday night AA meeting at Mountainside, Mr. Hodge forever transformed the traditional ceremony by injecting his positive energy and showmanship. Thousands of clients and other attendees from across the globe have a special place in their hearts for Mr. Hodge, as he not only gave them their first coin of sobriety but showed all of those in the room on Friday evenings that in sobriety you can have fun, laugh, and love. As a person in recovery, Mr. Hodge would pass on to others lessons he had learned about life beyond addiction, helping others to understand that being flawed was not only acceptable in life but is part of being human, a message that resonated with those in early recovery. Mr. Hodge, a former Non-Commissioned Officer with the United States Marine Corps, was always willing to share his story of addiction, so that others would feel comfortable sharing theirs. ""Addiction took things I didn't know I had. Recovery gave me things I didn't know I wanted,"" Mr. Hodge would often say. Mr. Hodge is survived by his soulmate Eliza Raphael-Hodge and his four children - Jerrina Lashely, Tanika Hodge, Jerrick Hodge, Jr, all of Baltimore, MD, and Victor Hodge. Jerrick is also survived by his sister Patricia Carter, his brother Reggie Hodge and several grandchildren. He was predeceased by his two brothers, Ronald Carter and Carl Hodge.

A longstanding member of the Museum's Trustee Committee on Archives, Library, and Research, Gilbert, along with his wife Lila, began collecting works by Fluxus artists in 1978. In 2008 the Museum acquired, through the generosity of Gilbert and Lila, the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection and Archives, widely considered the largest and most important collection of its kind in the world. Assembled in Detroit over three decades by the Silvermans, the collection comprises over 4,000 works in mediums ranging from printed ephemera, multiples, drawings, and sculptural objects, to photographs and film. The Silverman Collection also incorporates an archival and library component of over 5,500 files containing artists' correspondence, notebooks and scrapbooks, and publications, as well as documents and photographs related to Fluxus performances and events from the 1960s to the 1990s. Gilbert and Lila's collecting was iconoclastic, as much as the movement of Fluxus was itself. With a love of experimentation, chance operation and unceasing inventiveness, Gilbert's vision embraced the lives of artists whose works he collected, as much as the works themselves. We extend our deepest sympathies to Lila, a member of the Museum's Trustee Committee on Archives, Library, and Research, his children, and their families.

Dave was much loved by his colleagues and by generations of Stern students for his strength of character, his generosity and kindness, and his sharp wit. Dave was a gifted teacher. Driven by his own deep intellectual curiosity, he developed and spearheaded many visionary courses for both undergraduate and graduate students. Dave was the consummate modern academic. He loved research, teaching, and students. He was also a skilled leader who valued and strengthened the culture of academic institutions. Dave was never happier than when he could bring people together socially to share a beer and talk about research and ideas. Dave, you will be deeply missed, you left us too soon. Friday afternoons will never be the same. Prior to joining Stern in 1990, Dave studied at Hamilton College (BA, 1975) and Yale University (PhD, 1981), taught at Queen's University and the University of British Columbia, served at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and was a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research.

2016-06-19T00:00:00Z,"RILEY--George A.,of San Francisco, California, formerly of Memphis, Tennessee, age 59, died on June 8, 2016, after a determined and courageous fourteen-month battle with leukemia. He will be deeply missed by his sister, Peggy Thomson (Tim) of Germantown, Tennessee; his brother, John Riley (Maryellen) of Arlington Heights, Illinois; and his six nieces and nephews. George was preceded in death by his parents, Dr. Frances Riley and Dr. George A. Riley, both physicians in Memphis for many years. George was born on March 9, 1957, and grew up in Memphis. In 1975, he graduated from Whitehaven High School, where he was an active student leader for civil rights causes--a commitment to justice and public service he maintained throughout his life. George attributed that commitment to his chance meeting, as a young boy, with civil rights activist James Meredith shortly before Meredith was shot on June 6, 1966, while marching from Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi. In 1979, George graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and began working with consumer advocate Ralph Nader. During that time, George and Carl J Mayer co-authored the book Public Domain, Private Dominion: A History of Public Mineral Policy in America, about land use regulation by the Department of the Interior. In 1983, George graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he was instrumental in establishing the Harvard Fellowship in Public Interest Law. After law school, George returned to Memphis to clerk for the Honorable Judge Bailey Brown (U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit). In the mid-1980's, George moved to San Francisco, where he became special assistant to the San Francisco City Attorney and handled many of the city's most significant cases, including an action to open a local social club's membership to women and minorities. In 1993, George joined the San Francisco office of O'Melveny & Myers, an international law firm, becoming a prominent partner and one of the country's top intellectual property litigators. Known for his inexhaustible preparation and his eloquence in the courtroom, George was an invaluable global advisor to many iconic companies, including Apple, Samsung and Tesla. He shared an extremely special bond with Apple founder Steve Jobs and his family. George's high-profile clientele never diminished his commitment to the less fortunate. He donated hundreds of hours working with the Mississippi Center for Justice to help individuals displaced by Hurricane Katrina and others who faced seemingly insurmountable challenges. Throughout his life, George's love of running fueled his participation in countless long-distance races, creating many lasting friendships along the way. A cherished friend to so many, George always carved out time in his demanding schedule to counsel them on personal matters and share his passions for classical and sacred music, literature and Civil War history. Despite traveling the world, George's humility and Southern grace never waned. He returned to Memphis every February to run his favorite race, the Mike Cody Four Mile Classic, benefiting Rhodes College. George's premature passing is a tremendous loss to all who knew him. He defined generosity in mind, body and soul. A memorial service will be held Saturday, June 25, at 1pm in the auditorium at Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, with a reception to follow. Burial will be private. Memorial donations may be made to the Mississippi Center for Justice at mscenterforjustice.org. 1/3"

Pioneer in Design Journalism and Marketing Linda Rimanich Foa passed away peacefully at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan on June 17, 2016 after a long battle with cancer. She is survived by her husband, Conrad, their sons, Justin and Barrett, and grandchildren, Max and Luke. Her abiding interest in others, her incomparable style, and her take no prisoners demeanor, meant that everyone knew that she was ""in the room"". Her always-positive impact on her family and friends will be sorely missed. The stars were already aligning because Linda and Conrad were both born in Wickersham Hospital (across the street from Bloomingdale's); Linda was born there 51 weeks after her future husband. Her family resided in Jamaica Estates, New York City, where she graduated from The Mary Louis Academy. Linda majored in Fashion and Fine Arts at Parsons/NYU. Linda's sense of style, superb writing ability, and natural beauty were a unique combination that was unleashed on the world of design journalism. Linda began her professional career at Fairchild's Home Furnishings Daily and HFN where she was an editor, and penned the still-remembered FYI column. While mothering, she wrote several lead cover articles for New York Magazine, articles for The New York Times Style Section, and co-authored Kids' Stuff, the definitive furnishings guide to children's furniture and home environments [Pantheon/Random House]. In the 1990s, Linda headed and brought Designer's Saturday to prominence; producing a world-renowned annual contract furniture show in New York City that featured over 100 participating showrooms. The food and ambiance offered in the showrooms were even reviewed by Mimi Sheraton in The New York Times. For the past 11+ years, Linda was the Marketing Director of the Architects & Designers building at 150 East 58th Street. She is credited with burnishing the building's ability to attract high-end kitchen, bathroom and furniture showrooms. She contributed to a soaring occupancy rate and was instrumental in partnering with The New York Times to host the building-wide Taste of T foodie event for over a decade. Walking through the building with her, it was obvious that she was loved by tenants and co-workers alike. Linda, along with her spouse, were prominent members of the Lexington Democratic Club. She rose to the party post of District Leader and was a fierce proponent of the Club's role in forwarding and bettering the Democratic agenda. It was with great pleasure that she witnessed the presumptive nomination by the Democratic Party of the first female presidential nominee. The success of her children, Justin [fifth generation owner and CEO of 155 year-old international insurance brokerage firm, Foa & Son] and Barrett (respected, multi-talented lead actor, singer, dancer in two Tony Award-winning Broadway shows, with an eight year series-regular role on CBS's ""NCIS: Los Angeles"") speaks volumes about her exceptional mothering. Linda and her husband, Conrad, did everything together and were rarely apart during their 50 year relationship. A memorial service for Linda will we held at the Unitarian Church of All Souls at 1157 Lexington Avenue (80th Street) on July 28, 2016 at 11:00am. There will be a reception for Linda's friends after the service. 1/3"

In emotionally direct prose and watercolors full of tiny, charming details, Bagley (“Boats for Papa”) turns two of the forest’s less charismatic creatures into heart-stealing stars. Zelda, a hedgehog, looks forlorn as she tells Aaron, an anteater, he can’t come along to her family’s new house.

2016-06-20T00:00:00Z,"LEDBETTER--Myron C. died at his home in Belle Terre, NY on June 1, at the age of 92. He had been an active and well-known member of his community for many years. Myron was born in Ardmore, OK on June 25, 1923, the son of the late Robert and Adeline Ledbetter. Myron was a freshman at Oklahoma State when World War II began. During the summer of 1942 he earned a commission as an ensign in the United States Navy and was assigned to LST 947. His ship was part of the invasion of Okinawa and occupation of Japan. Upon his discharge Myron returned to Oklahoma to finish his studies in plant biology at Oklahoma State, then realizing he needed further education in his chosen field of plant biology, went to UC Berkeley for a Master's Degree. Myron worked as a Research Assistant at Boyce Thompson Institute in Yonkers, NY while pursuing his PhD work in botany at Columbia University. To further his specialized work on the plant cell research, Myron then went to Rockefeller Institute to work with Dr. Keith Porter to develop new techniques on the electron microscope. A year later to continue his research, he went to Harvard University with Dr. Porter's team. Working with the electron microscope, Myron and Dr. Porter published many new important findings, ultimately resulting in the publication of an atlas of plant cells ""Introduction to the Fine Structure of Plant Cells."" Finally in 1965 Myron accepted a position as a cell biologist and ultimately senior cell biologist at Brookhaven National Laboratory where he stayed until his retirement in 1989. Myron was a highly respected cell biologist and well known for his work on the electron microscope. He and Dr. Porter published research in 1963 on the discovery of a new organelle in plant cells, the microtubule, which initiated a whole new area of plant cell biology research, a discovery so significant that fifty years later the July 2013 issue of the scientific journal ""Plant Journal"" devoted its entire issue to the importance of this finding. Myron, and another colleague Robert Dell, invented a self-cleaning aperture to correct a problem with the electron microscope, a gad- get which saved hours of down time of the microscope and is still widely in use. Myron was elected as the president of the Electron Microscopy Society of America for 1978. That Society also awarded him the Distinguished Scientist Award, Biological Sciences, for 1996. Myron possessed a keen inquiring intellect and had a seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of and interest in many areas. He was particularly interested in social justice and human rights and established the Myron C. Ledbetter Diversity Scholarship at Oklahoma State University. In 2000 he was given the OSU Distinguished Alumni Award. Myron enjoyed theater and classical music, travel, reading, book discussion groups, entertaining and dining out. He and his life partner of over 55 years, John D'Aquila who predeceased him in 2014, had been subscribing members of the Metropolitan Opera and the Roundabout Theater Company for many years. In Port Jefferson they particularly enjoyed Theatre Three. Myron was a co-founder of OLLI (Osher Lifelong Learning Institute) at Stony Brook University and participated in many of its programs. He became interested in stained glass and created many beautiful imaginative pieces, some even based on his own microscopic plant cell enlargements. He was an active member of the memoirs group and continued as long as his health permitted. Myron traveled extensively. He and John had friends everywhere, including the group with whom he served in WWII. In 2012 Myron and John were married, an event which gave great joy to their family and friends. Myron was predeceased by his brother Robert. He is survived by a sister-in-law Marcia Ledbetter and by a cousin Margaret Garland, and by many loving nieces and nephews and by a host of lifelong friends. Myron Ledbetter was a gracious and kind man and a thoughtful friend. He will be greatly missed. Memorial donations in Myron's name may be made to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, NY, NY 10065. Expressions of condolence may be sent to the family of Myron C. Ledbetter c/o www. obdavisportjefferson.com A celebration of Myron's life will be held on June 26, at the Belle Terre Community Center, Cliff Road at 11am. 1/3"

2016-06-20T00:00:00Z,"FOA--Linda. Pioneer in Design Journalism and Marketing Linda Rimanich Foa passed away peacefully at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan on June 17, 2016 after a long battle with cancer. She is survived by her husband, Conrad, their sons, Justin and Barrett, and grandchildren, Max and Luke. Her abiding interest in others, her incomparable style, and her take no prisoners demeanor, meant that everyone knew that she was ""in the room"". Her always-positive impact on her family and friends will be sorely missed. The stars were already aligning because Linda and Conrad were both born in Wickersham Hospital (across the street from Bloomingdale's); Linda was born there 51 weeks after her future husband. Her family resided in Jamaica Estates, New York City, where she graduated from The Mary Louis Academy. Linda majored in Fashion and Fine Arts at Parsons/NYU. Linda's sense of style, superb writing ability, and natural beauty were a unique combination that was unleashed on the world of design journalism. Linda began her professional career at Fairchild's Home Furnishings Daily and HFN where she was an editor, and penned the still-remembered FYI column. While mothering, she wrote several lead cover articles for New York Magazine, articles for The New York Times Style Section, and co-authored Kids' Stuff, the definitive furnishings guide to children's furniture and home environments [Pantheon/Random House]. In the 1990s, Linda headed and brought Designer's Saturday to prominence; producing a world-renowned annual contract furniture show in New York City that featured over 100 participating showrooms. The food and ambiance offered in the showrooms were even reviewed by Mimi Sheraton in The New York Times. For the past 11+ years, Linda was the Marketing Director of the Architects & Designers building at 150 East 58th Street. She is credited with burnishing the building's ability to attract high-end kitchen, bathroom and furniture showrooms. She contributed to a soaring occupancy rate and was instrumental in partnering with The New York Times to host the building-wide Taste of T foodie event for over a decade. Walking through the building with her, it was obvious that she was loved by tenants and co-workers alike. Linda, along with her spouse, were prominent members of the Lexington Democratic Club. She rose to the party post of District Leader and was a fierce proponent of the Club's role in forwarding and bettering the Democratic agenda. It was with great pleasure that she witnessed the presumptive nomination by the Democratic Party of the first female presidential nominee. The success of her children, Justin [fifth generation owner and CEO of 155 year-old international insurance brokerage firm, Foa & Son] and Barrett (respected, multi-talented lead actor, singer, dancer in two Tony Award-winning Broadway shows, with an eight year series-regular role on CBS's ""NCIS: Los Angeles"") speaks volumes about her exceptional mothering. Linda and her husband, Conrad, did everything together and were rarely apart during their 50 year relationship. A memorial service for Linda will we held at the Unitarian Church of All Souls at 1157 Lexington Avenue (80th Street) on June 28, 2016 at 11:00am. There will be a reception for Linda's friends after the service. 1/3"

2016-06-21T00:00:00Z,"FOA--Linda. Pioneer in Design Journalism and Marketing Linda Rimanich Foa passed away peacefully at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan on June 17, 2016 after a long battle with cancer. She is survived by her husband, Conrad, their sons, Justin and Barrett, and grandchildren, Max and Luke. Her abiding interest in others, her incomparable style, and her take no prisoners demeanor, meant that everyone knew that she was ""in the room"". Her always-positive impact on her family and friends will be sorely missed. The stars were already aligning because Linda and Conrad were both born in Wickersham Hospital (across the street from Bloomingdale's); Linda was born there 51 weeks after her future husband. Her family resided in Jamaica Estates, New York City, where she graduated from The Mary Louis Academy. Linda majored in Fashion and Fine Arts at Parsons/NYU. Linda's sense of style, superb writing ability, and natural beauty were a unique combination that was unleashed on the world of design journalism. Linda began her professional career at Fairchild's Home Furnishings Daily and HFN where she was an editor, and penned the still-remembered FYI column. While mothering, she wrote several lead cover articles for New York Magazine, articles for The New York Times Style Section, and co-authored Kids' Stuff, the definitive furnishings guide to children's furniture and home environments [Pantheon/Random House]. In the 1990s, Linda headed and brought Designer's Saturday to prominence; producing a world-renowned annual contract furniture show in New York City that featured over 100 participating showrooms. The food and ambiance offered in the showrooms were even reviewed by Mimi Sheraton in The New York Times. For the past 11+ years, Linda was the Marketing Director of the Architects & Designers building at 150 East 58th Street. She is credited with burnishing the building's ability to attract high-end kitchen, bathroom and furniture showrooms. She contributed to a soaring occupancy rate and was instrumental in partnering with The New York Times to host the building-wide Taste of T foodie event for over a decade. Walking through the building with her, it was obvious that she was loved by tenants and co-workers alike. Linda, along with her spouse, were prominent members of the Lexington Democratic Club. She rose to the party post of District Leader and was a fierce proponent of the Club's role in forwarding and bettering the Democratic agenda. It was with great pleasure that she witnessed the presumptive nomination by the Democratic Party of the first female presidential nominee. The success of her children, Justin [fifth generation owner and CEO of 155 year-old international insurance brokerage firm, Foa & Son] and Barrett (respected, multi-talented lead actor, singer, dancer in two Tony Award-winning Broadway shows, with an eight year series-regular role on CBS's ""NCIS: Los Angeles"") speaks volumes about her exceptional mothering. Linda and her husband, Conrad, did everything together and were rarely apart during their 50 year relationship. A memorial service for Linda will we held at the Unitarian Church of All Souls at 1157 Lexington Avenue (80th Street) on June 28, 2016 at 11:00am. There will be a reception for Linda's friends after the service. 1/3"

Kenworth (Ken) was born in East Orange, NJ, the son of Kenworth Alvin Moffett and Kathryn Lily Moffett. Moffett earned his bachelor's degree from Columbia University in 1960 and his doctorate in art history from Harvard University in 1968, where he became an expert on 19th- and 20th-century art and art criticism, and an advocate of abstract expressionism and color field painting in particular. Early in his career, Moffett achieved full professor of art history at Wellesley College, where he taught from 1969 to 1978. While a professor, he started his tenure as the first Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, a role he held from 1971 to 1984. After five years spent advising art collectors on impressionist, early modern, and contemporary art acquisitions from 1984 to 1989, he served as Director of the Fort Lauderdale Museum from 1989 to 1997 and helped found the Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver, CO in 1998. Over the course of his prolific career, he organized or supervised more than 100 exhibitions; built public, private, and corporate collections; co-curated the first large exhibition of American art to tour China; and wrote monographs on Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Fairfield Porter, and Odd Nerdrum, as well as a volume, New New Painting, which he co-authored with the Belgian critic Marcel Paquet. His dissertation was also published as a book, Meier-Graefe as Art Critic, by Prestel Verlag (Munich) in 1973. During the eighties, he published Moffett's Artletter, which contained news and opinion about the art world and art market, and more recently had an online version, Moffett's Artletter 2.0. For the last 25 years of his life, he championed a group of artists called the New New Painters, who he considered to be the successors of Jackson Pollock and the New York School of abstract expressionism and color field painting. He is survived by his wife Cynthia Horvath Moffett, daughter Kathryn (Kay) Moffett, son-in-law Neil Parker, granddaughter Matilda Moffett Parker, and hundreds of friends and artists who loved him. 1/3"

2016-06-26T00:00:00Z,"BERLINER--Rena. Rena Berliner, beloved wife of the late Moses Berliner, passed away peacefully on June 21, 2016, after a brief illness. She was surrounded by her family, daughter Rochelle Berliner, son Sherwin Borsuk and his wife, Ruth, and her cherished grandchildren Declan Kurant, Ethan Borsuk and wife, Maritza and Amaranth Borsuk and husband, Brad Bouse. She leaves behind her Canadian nephews and nieces, Sam and Betsy Berliner, Assaf and Betty Drori and their families. She also leaves her beloved and closest friend of 80 years, Clara Lato. Rena and her mother, Clara Schoenthal, survived the Holocaust but lost the rest of their immediate family: father, grandmother and sister. She spent part of the war in the Lvov ghetto, under Russian and, later, Nazi control. She escaped the ghetto by selling her Mother's diamond ring so the two could pay to be smuggled out. They spent the rest of the war hidden in a sub-cellar. A Mrs. Tokazewicz was paid to hide them and another family. When they ran out of funds they were helped by an underground Polish organization, Zegota, which aided many Jewish fugitives. While in hiding, Rena met her first husband, Mathias Borsuk, whom she thought the last living Jewish young man in Europe. After the war Rena and her mother lived in the Neu Freimann displaced persons camp in Munich, where Rena studied voice at the Handel-Konservatorium and helped found a touring musical group, which performed at DP camps and brought pleasure to many fellow survivors. After emigrating to the U.S. in 1949, she divorced Mathias, and she and her mother settled in Rego Park, NY, where Rena continued singing for Jewish organizations while raising her infant son, Sherwin. She soon met her second husband, Moses Berliner, a survivor from Lodz, Poland. Because of his mechanical expertise, Moses and his brother Jack survived the Holocaust and Auschwitz as slave laborers fashioning propellers for the Nazis. Rena and Moses were the adoring parents of a daughter, Rochelle, and were very proud of their children's careers as a radiologist and lawyer, respectively. Though Rena lost her faith in God during the war, she never lost her connection to Judaism. She was president of the Tel Chai Chapter of Hadassah, and its area Vice President, in Queens, NY. She loved opera, which she once sang professionally, and despite paraplegia, which left her wheelchair-bound for the last fifteen years, her kindness and bright spirit remained undimmed. She was an inveterate dispenser of chocolate to everyone she met. She loved to read, and her home was filled with books. She read The New York Times daily, and was honored to be profiled on January 15, 2000. She loved all animals, plants, and children, and her dog, Mimi, was a source of much joy.

She was 92. Anita was born in 1924 in Brooklyn and raised in the Bronx. Her father, Alexander Alpert, owned a yarn importing business and was a respected oil painter. Although she showed early talent as a singer and artist, Anita did not actively devote herself to singing until after her marriage. Anita made her debut as a mezzo-soprano at Carnegie Hall in 1948 under the stage name Anita Alpert, and first sang in the chorus at the City Center and the Metropolitan Opera. She sang for many years on Broadway, including the 1959 production of Once Upon a Mattress with Carol Burnett, where, as understudy to the Queen, she performed the role when the lead fell ill. She was the understudy for Lady Thiang in the King and I, and sang in Bajour with Chita Rivera and Herschel Bernardi in 1964. She also appeared in the 1964 revival of The King and I, and in the 1965 revival of Kismet at Lincoln Center's New York State Theater, where she performed the role of Zubedya. After moving to Long Island, Anita sang at the Jones Beach Marine Theatre with Guy Lombardo and his orchestra in the 1956-57 production of Show Boat, where she was the understudy for Julie, and in the Song of Norway in 1958. In addition to her work on the stage, she formed a folk singing duo, Allan & Arden, with her friend and neighbor, Sherry Arden, the President of William Morrow & Company. Anita married Samuel Herman in 1946. They moved to Merrick, Long Island in 1953, where they raised two children. Anita relished her role as glamorous entertainer, throwing lavish parties and cooking international food not yet familiar in suburban Long Island. Through her singing on Holland America cruise ships, they were able to travel extensively. Their most memorable cruise was to Cuba during Castro's revolution, where they shared a hotel with machine gun carrying revolutionaries. After her singing career, Anita attended Fordham College and graduated summa cam laude at the age of 56. She worked as an intern for the McNeill Lehrer Report, and then worked for several years as a paralegal for the firm of Squadron Ellenoff.

Until her final few days, she was alert and interested in family, politics and life in general. She and her late husband were longtime residents of Oyster Bay, NY, where they raised seven sons and a daughter. Her earliest years as an Army child included three years in Germany where her father John L. Pierce (husband of Kate Bodine Stone) served in the Occupation.

She demonstrated an early proficiency in art, which she studied at Texas State College for Women and Auburn; to the amazement of friends, she continued to paint amid the clatter of a growing houseful of children. She was an avid reader of fiction and nonfiction, and she encouraged each of her children to keep an open and expanding mind.

2016-06-26T00:00:00Z,"PARK--Dorothy Dent, died quietly at her home in Ithaca, New York, on Saturday, June 18, 2016 among her family and devoted staff and nurses dedicated to her care and well-being. Known as ""Dottie"" she was preceded in death by her husband Roy Hampton Park, founder, chairman and CEO of Park Communications whose broadcast, newspaper and outdoor media conglomerate reached 25 percent of the American public when he died in 1993. Growing up in Raleigh, North Carolina, she met her husband, a graduate of North Carolina State University, on a blind date. They moved to Ithaca, New York when her husband was hired to run the ad agency for the Grange League Federation, one of the largest farm cooperatives in the world, which later became Agway. Through this Agricultural Advertising and Research agency, Dottie's entrepreneurial husband went on meet Duncan Hines at the Waldorf Astoria to co-found Hines-Park Foods with 124 companies licensed to use the gourmet Duncan Hines name on 250 products, of which the cake mix line survives today. During the launch of the Duncan Hines food line, Dottie and Roy traveled with Duncan Hines for months at a time to just about every major city in America to meet with mayors and dignitaries for Duncan Hines Days. After Proctor & Gamble approached Park and purchased the company, Mr. Park used the stock to launch into the media business. With his wife's devotion and support, and always at his side, they met and charmed legions of prospective businesses in the media field across the country. Her husband's job was to acquire properties and Dottie's job was to host the wives of the owners of the properties he acquired. Dottie constantly entertained during their travels and at home, being always the consummate southern lady, but more than once thought of as a steel magnolia. After all the years of helping her husband through his separate careers, Dottie and Roy joined Walter Cronkite and his wife, Betsy, at the Waldorf to celebrate their joint 50th wedding anniversaries. When Walter asked Dottie what her husband had given her, she proudly replied ""One thousand dollars for each year we've been married."" To which Cronkite said ""That's all he gave you? That's awful. If you figure it out, it only comes to $2.74 a day."" One can imagine the repercussions from that. During his career her husband was a trustee of the Museum of Broadcasting in New York City, president and treasurer of the Sales Executive Club of Greater New York, a member of the New York Athletic Club, the Cornell Club of New York, the Union League Club of New York City and owner of WPAT-FM serving the greater New York City area. Upon the death of her husband, Dottie decided to sell Park Communications in its entirety with the proceeds going to the Park Foundation that she and her husband had founded 29 years earlier. With her husband's will designating her President of the newly funded Park Foundation, Inc. It was agreed by its Board of Trustees its core mission was to fund the academic institutions with which her husband had been affiliated during his lifetime. Park Scholarships were established for four- year undergraduate programs at North Carolina State University and Ithaca College as well as graduate Roy H. Park Fellowships for MBAs at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University, and Master's and PhD Park Fellows at the School of Media and Journalism at the University of North Carolina. Initial core grantees also included the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in Ithaca, the only board position her husband retained until he died, and Public Broadcasting Service programming such as Nova and Nature. Under her leadership as President of the Park Foundation, Dottie's philanthropy was also spread far and wide, from the country's first no-kill animal shelter, to Ithaca College, home of the Roy H. Park School of Communications, to the Park Atrium addition to the Cornell School of Hotel Administration, and the Roy H. Park Library at the School of Media and Journalism in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In 2003 members her son along with his son and daughter created a second foundation, Triad Foundation, Inc., which permitted both foundations to pursue the philanthropic objectives that best reflected the diverse needs of their respective Boards. To date, between the two Foundations over 2,000 students have graduated from the four Universities with full tuition paid. Since 1995 charitable grants given by both Foundations have totaled over half a billion dollars. All in all, Dottie was an ardent lover of nature, animals and mankind. Numerous people received hospitality in this transplanted Southerner's northern home. She will be missed. Surviving are her son, Roy Hampton Park, Jr. and his wife Tetlow, her daughter Adelaide Park Gomer, all of Ithaca, New York; her grandchildren: Elizabeth Park Fowler and husband Troy of Tampa, Florida, Roy Hampton Park III and his wife Laura of Charlotte, North Carolina and Alicia Park Wittink and her husband Mark of Ithaca, New York. Also surviving are nine great grandchildren: Noble Brooks Fowler, Chase Hampton Fowler, Elizabeth Sumner Park, Samantha Tetlow Fowler, Roy Hampton Park IV, Lawson Brooks Park, Cameron Parham Park, Anneke Dickson Wittink, and Mathijs August Park Wittink. A Memorial service will be held at 1:00pm on Thursday, June 30 at the First Presbyterian Church of Ithaca with a reception to follow at the Country Club of Ithaca.

2016-06-26T00:00:00Z,"YOUNG--Patricia Morris. September 16, 1919 - June 8, 2016. Asian art historian, founding director of the Asia Society Texas Center, long-time resident in Thailand, wife and mother, Patricia Morris Young's life revolved around her passion for art history, her deep commitment to passing her knowledge on to others, and her unalloyed delight in the wonders of other cultures. From an early age she enjoyed visual expressions of beauty particularly painting and sculpture. Refining this sensibility became a lifelong pursuit. She began with a foundation in European art history which led to her vocation as a lecturer and writer on Southeast Asian art. Born in Washington, DC, she was educated at the Potomac School, Miss Hall's School in Massachusetts, and graduated from Vassar College in 1941 with a degree in History. In 1943 she married Kenneth T. Young, Jr. She raised four children in Washington and New York before moving the family to Bangkok, Thailand, where her husband served as American Ambassador from 1961 to 1963. Her encounter with Asia changed her life. She traveled extensively in Southeast Asia, began her study of Southeast Asian art, and worked to promote contemporary Thai artists. Returning to the United States she combined her roles as wife and mother with graduate studies in Asian art. In 1976 she went to work for the Asia Society, running the Society's Asian tour programs. In 1979 she moved to Houston to become the founding director of the Asia Society Texas Center. She retired in 1986, returning to Bangkok where she spent seventeen years deepening her knowledge of Asian art and culture, traveling widely from Japan to India. Thai art and culture were her special areas of interest and expertise. For many years she pursued a fascination with Thai Buddhist lacquer murals, writing several articles on her findings. A member of the Association of Asian Studies and the Siam Society since the early 1960s, she worked tirelessly to promote an understanding of Asian cultures. Her gifts were her ability to listen, to establish friendships, and to connect like-minded individuals who shared her passion. She was particularly interested in bringing Thai and Western art historians together. She loved learning and encouraged others to do so through teaching and lecturing in Asia and the U.S. She wanted to help others see and appreciate the beauty she saw in Asian painting, sculpture, music, dance, crafts, and architecture. Her graciousness and kindness won her friends wherever she traveled. She is survived by her four children, six grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

2016-06-26T00:00:00Z,"JONES--Randy. British-born, New York Citybased drummer Randy Jones passed away in Calvary Hospital on Monday, June 13, 2016, of heart failure. Known as one of the most versatile drummers of his time, he was 72 years old. Randy began as a drummer in an English rock-and-roll band and became a session drummer in London before joining the Maynard Ferguson Big Band. He came to the United States in 1972, and was soon recognized for his work with such noted jazz greats as Chet Baker, Gerry Mulligan and Bill Watrous. In 1978 he joined the Dave Brubeck Quartet, with which he toured and recorded for more than three decades. Randy was a passionate collector of classical records, and his drum solos reflected that interest. He is survived by his son, Thad Jones; grandsons Bryce and Peyton Jones; sister, Christine Wickham-Jones; and former wife and close friend, Laurie Beckelman. A memorial service will be held in the fall. 1/3"

Okoronkwo, Kanu David Okoronkwo, Ifeoma Okoronkwo and daughter-in-law, Nieves Chevalier Okoronkwo were all present at her bedside as she was ushered from this world to the next. Also, present were her grandson, Jean Pierre Hernandez who represented all of her eight grandchildren, as well as two of her most beloved caregivers, Carol Blair and Synetta Smith. Sylvia Okoronkwo was born in Weldon, North Carolina to Wilbert Johnson and Pauline Stith. After gaining the highest accolades in academics, she went on to study nursing where once again she excelled. While pursuing graduate studies in nursing at Columbia University she met Kanu Okoronkwo, Sr., and in May, 1959 the two were married at St. John's Cathedral in New York City. The young couple returned to Kanu Okoronkwo Sr.'s native land, Nigeria, where Sylvia Okoronkwo pursued volunteerism at the local hospitals and played hostess to various actors and dignitaries, while her husband became the head of telecommunications of southeast Nigeria. Sylvia and Kanu Okoronkwo brought three children into the world, Chinyere, Kanu and Ifeoma. But, at the climax of the Biafran War in 1967, with their lives in danger, Sylvia Okoronkwo fled Nigeria with her three children in tow and one suitcase in hand to her birth land of the United States of America. Still known for her excellence in nursing and having kept her credentials active, Sylvia Okoronkwo was appointed surgical nurse to the newly opened cardiothoracic unit at the New York Hospital. Mrs. O, as she was famously known, ended up working for New York Hospital for almost 40 years in the pediatric urology unit and finally as the medical nursing supervisor of the evening shift. It was her love of nursing, and the love of her grandchildren, that truly sustained her throughout her life. Sylvia Okoronkwo is survived by her children Chinyere Okoronkwo, Kanu David Okoronkwo, Ifeoma Okoronkwo, her daughter-in-law, Nieves Chevalier Okoronkwo, her dear Yeimi Chevalier and her grandchildren, Anastasia Williams Okoronkwo, Aaron Hernandez, Kate Aitkenhead, Jean Pierre Hernandez.

Wilson, Jr., M.D., who made outstanding contributions to the hospital's growth, work and mission over five decades. He led Hospital for Special Surgery in advancing the field of joint replacement and orthopedic research, fostering the hospital's development as a worldclass center for patient care. As an educator and innovator of new techniques, Dr. Wilson introduced total hip replacement to the hospital in 1967, a new surgical procedure at the time. He went on to serve as the hospital's surgeon-in-chief from 1972 to 1989 and was recognized not only for his surgical skill, wisdom, integrity and sound judgment, but also for his compassion and thoughtfulness. His leadership and dedication helped transform Hospital for Special Surgery from an institution of local recognition to one of international acclaim. During his 17-year tenure as surgeon-in-chief, he developed a robust research department that brought together engineers and orthopedic surgeons and ushered biomechanics into the computer age. During this time, he held the dual role of Director of Resident Training, fostering innovation in graduate medical education and serving as a role model and inspiration for young, aspiring orthopedic surgeons. Dr. Wilson will be remembered as a leader in orthopedics, as an innovator, a mentor and a friend. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his entire family. Kendrick R.

2016-06-30T00:00:00Z,"MORRIS--Irving Nathaniel. Irving Morris, an attorney known for his tenacious representation of plaintiffs across a broad range of litigation over a five-decade career, died on Tuesday at his home in Palm Beach, Florida. He was ninety years old. Irving Nathaniel Morris was born in Trenton, New Jersey, on December 18, 1925, the third of Abraham and Katie Morris' four children. The family moved to Wilmington, Delaware, when Morris was two years old. He lived, practiced law and raised a family there until his retirement in 2001. Morris turned nineteen in a foxhole, was captured during the Battle of the Bulge, and spent six weeks as a ""guest of the Germans"" before being liberated in 1945. After completing studies at the University of Delaware and Yale Law School on the GI Bill, Morris served for two years as a law clerk to U.S. District Court Chief Judge Paul Leahy, before entering private practice in 1953. Morris specialized in representing shareholders injured by corporations' misstatements and misconduct, and spent decades fighting segregation and pursuing equal opportunity in education for Delaware's school children. He was a member of the American College of Trial Lawyers, the American Bar Foundation, the American Bar Association, and served as President of the Delaware Bar Association. He was awarded the Delaware Bar Association's highest award for leadership and service, The First State Distinguished Service Award. He was also a leader in his community, serving as President of Congregation Beth Shalom, where he was a lifelong member, and chairing fundraising campaigns for The United Way and the Jewish Federation of Delaware. Morris retired from the practice of the law on September 11, 2001, directing his energy to ""The Rape Case"", a book chronicling his successful 1950s defense on appeal of three accused rapists. The case established the principal that the presence of police perjury renders a trial fundamentally unfair, denying due process as guaranteed in the Constitution. Morris was predeceased by his siblings, Melvin, Sylvia Rochlin and Herbert; his son, Jonathan; son-in-law, Bruce Zakheim; and by Doris, his wife of 58 years. He is survived by his daughters, Deborah Zakheim and Karen Morris (Alan Levenson); and his son, David; and by nine grandchildren who were enriched by years of Grandpa's unwavering attention and unquestioning love: Jonathan (Amanda), Adam, Benjamin, Tyler, Joshua, Devin, Samuel, Shelby, and Peyton. Funeral services will be 11:00am, Friday, July 1, 2016 at Congregation Beth Shalom, 1801 Baynard Boulevard, Wilmington, DE 19802. Shiva will be observed 7:30pm, Saturday, July 2 through Thursday, July 7 at the home of Karen Morris and Alan Levenson.

2016-07-01T00:00:00Z,"NOTKIN--Darcie Denkert. Darcie Denkert, longtime MGM executive and female pioneer in entertainment law, passed away at her home in West Los Angeles on June 10 after a long struggle with cancer. She was interred at Hillside Cemetery on June 13. Denkert became the first female lawyer at United Artists (UA) when she started her tenure there in 1976. She later moved on to become one of the first women in the industry to lead a business and legal affairs department at a major studio with her role at MGM. Denkert was a graduate of the NYU School of Law when she began her entertainment industry career as a Broadway theatre lawyer in New York City. With the exception of a short stint at ICM and Embassy Pictures in the mid-1980s, she spent 26 years at UA and its successor company MGM in various senior business and legal affairs positions. In 1997, she was named head of the department at MGM and served in that position for the next five years. In 2002, Denkert combined her love of Broadway theatre and film, and formed MGM ON STAGE with her longtime business associate and friend Dean Stolber. The new enterprise was aimed at exploiting MGM's film library in the theatrical world and its success inspired many other studios to take their films to Broadway. Together, Denkert and Stolber produced 10 shows using MGM's film library, creating such Broadway show hits as ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"" ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"" ""Legally Blonde,"" and ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert."" In 2005, Denkert wrote ""A Fine Romance: Hollywood/Broadway (The Magic, The Mayhem, The Musicals),"" a beautifully illustrated and insightful text on the great shows of Broadway and their translation to the screen. True to her commitment to the film and theatrical industries, Denkert donated all of the royalties from ""A Fine Romance"" to the Motion Picture & Television Fund (MPTF) and The Actors Fund. Denkert's ""A Fine Romance"" became the foundation for an annual musical fundraiser produced by MPTF to celebrate the intersection of Broadway and Hollywood and raise millions of dollars for the charity. Denkert was a board member of MPTF for five years and an outstanding contributor to serving the organization's mission of taking care of its own. In 2002, Denkert became the chair of its Case Committee where all key decisions about charitable support for industry members are adjudicated. She was also a board member of the Simms/Mann Centre at UCLA, from which she received invaluable care from a dedicated staff throughout her illness. Additionally, Denkert was a tireless advocate for the welfare of neglected and abused dogs. In August 2002, Denkert married Allen Susman, founding partner of the law firm Rosenfeld, Meyer and Susman. Susman passed away in January 2007. In 2011, Denkert married Shelby Notkin, chairman of the private client services division at Capital Group. Denkert is survived by her husband Shelby, her mother Renee, her stepdaughter Michelle, a step grandson, as well as four stepchildren from her marriage to Susman. At the family's request, donations can be made to the CPMC Foundation/Notkin Family Breast Cancer Recovery Program or JCCF Simms/Mann Center. 1/3"

2016-07-01T00:00:00Z,"MORRIS--Irving Nathaniel. Irving Morris, an attorney known for his tenacious representation of plaintiffs across a broad range of litigation over a five-decade career, died on Tuesday at his home in Palm Beach, Florida. He was ninety years old. Irving Nathaniel Morris was born in Trenton, New Jersey, on December 18, 1925, the third of Abraham and Katie Morris' four children. The family moved to Wilmington, Delaware, when Morris was two years old. He lived, practiced law and raised a family there until his retirement in 2001. Morris turned nineteen in a foxhole, was captured during the Battle of the Bulge, and spent six weeks as a ""guest of the Germans"" before being liberated in 1945. After completing studies at the University of Delaware and Yale Law School on the GI Bill, Morris served for two years as a law clerk to U.S. District Court Chief Judge Paul Leahy, before entering private practice in 1953. Morris specialized in representing shareholders injured by corporations' misstatements and misconduct, and spent decades fighting segregation and pursuing equal opportunity in education for Delaware's school children. He was a member of the American College of Trial Lawyers, the American Bar Foundation, the American Bar Association, and served as President of the Delaware Bar Association. He was awarded the Delaware Bar Association's highest award for leadership and service, The First State Distinguished Service Award. He was also a leader in his community, serving as President of Congregation Beth Shalom, where he was a lifelong member, and chairing fundraising campaigns for The United Way and the Jewish Federation of Delaware. Morris retired from the practice of the law on September 11, 2001, directing his energy to ""The Rape Case"", a book chronicling his successful 1950s defense on appeal of three accused rapists. The case established the principal that the presence of police perjury renders a trial fundamentally unfair, denying due process as guaranteed in the Constitution. Morris was predeceased by his siblings, Melvin, Sylvia Rochlin and Herbert; his son, Jonathan; son-in-law, Bruce Zakheim; and by Doris, his wife of 58 years. He is survived by his daughters, Deborah Zakheim and Karen Morris (Alan Levenson); and his son, David; and by nine grandchildren who were enriched by years of Grandpa's unwavering attention and unquestioning love: Jonathan (Amanda), Adam, Benjamin, Tyler, Joshua, Devin, Samuel, Shelby, and Peyton. Funeral services will be 11:00am, Friday, July 1, 2016 at Congregation Beth Shalom, 1801 Baynard Boulevard, Wilmington, DE 19802. Shiva will be observed 7:30pm, Saturday, July 2 through Thursday, July 7 at the home of Karen Morris and Alan Levenson. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions in memory of Irving Morris to the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law (www.brennancenter.org) or to HIAS (www.hias.org).

Jay was a first generation American, born in Brooklyn and raised in Long Beach, New York. He attended the University of Vermont and, after a year there, attended the University of Wisconsin and its Law School, where he achieved top tier ranks while attending only a few lectures, as he was busy driving back and forth selling real estate in Chicago resulting in becoming a millionaire before he graduated. He also received three degrees at the same time, in Law, Psychology and History. His wealth of intellectual talents and ability led him to pursue a career in law, where he was hired on the spot in an interview at the prestigious New York City law firm of Cravath Swaine & Moore. Jay's ambitions led him to later become an entrepreneur with various business successes, including forming and growing his real estate firm with its portfolio of properties across the United States. Jay enjoyed yearly trips to Sun Valley for skiing and the beauty of its slopes. He also enjoyed traveling to Paris and throughout Europe, as well as a safari to Botswana. He had a vast knowledge of numerous topics, one of which was World War II, where he could recite the key invasion dates, battles, defeats and the like, as he was an avid reader. He enjoyed the arts, especially ballet, and regularly attended the theater and opera. Jay thoroughly enjoyed many aspects of his life, and people he encountered from all walks of life all found him to be exceptionally charming, witty and a great raconteur. Wherever he went, he owned the room with his charm, elegance, brilliance, and modesty. He enjoyed spending his weekends at his beautiful property in Southampton. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and business colleagues. Jay is survived by his devoted wife of 34 years, Maria Kimberly Landesman, whom he cherished, and by his sister, Rochelle Landesman Millen, his brother, Sheldon Landesman and many of his siblings' children and grandchildren. A funeral service will be held at Frank Campbell's Funeral Chapel at 1076 Madison Avenue, New York, New York on July 6, 2016 at 11:30am.

There he quarterbacked the high school football team, winning a championship, before he decided to become a doctor with a loan from an uncle. He went to Emory University for his undergraduate and medical degree and began his rotation as an intern at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta from 1940-41. He then joined the Army Air Corps in 1941 serving in Panama. Discharged in 1945, having achieved a rank of Lieutenant Colonel, he went to Boston to do his residency at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary from 1946-48. Also he worked at the ENT laboratory at Harvard Medical School which he described as the happiest year he ever had in medicine. There he met and married Kathleen Foreman from Regina, Saskatchewan. They had two children, Michael and Tracy. After his residency in Boston he joined Dr. Julius Lempert at the Lempert Institute of Otology in New York City. Dr. Lempart was considered the father of otology, and Dr. Rambo became his associate and stayed at the Institute for many years, learning all he could along with the best otologists in medicine. It was at the Institute that he developed his own techniques in the field of middle-ear and mastoid surgery. His modesty, scrupulous attention to detail and fierce focus made him a much sought after surgeon. He loved his profession and was proud of it. He appeared on the cover of Modern Medicine in 1958. In 1957, he joined the staff of Lennox Hill Hospital in New York City where he said the generous support of his fellow doctors made it a joy for him. In 1958 he was invited to Alaska to lend his surgical skills to the native peoples of Pt. Barrow near the Arctic Circle. Flying by bush pilot he said it was an adventure and they were lucky to escape with their lives. He pursued golf and won a doctor's championship in 1973. He retired in 1983. He was fascinated by the family's civil war history and by the Rambo family origins, discovering that one young man who arrived from Sweden in 1640 helped start, and become the father of the New Sweden colony. Dr. Rambo died in New York City at his home on his 101st birthday. 1/3"

2016-07-03T00:00:00Z,"BREEN--Daniel Anthony, Jr. Of Houston, TX and East Hampton, NY, passed away peacefully on Monday, the 27th of June 2016, at the age of 87. A nationally recognized pioneer in the field of investment management, Dan was a larger than life personality. He loved sports, he loved music - he never passed up the chance to sing ""Danny Boy"" and ""My Way"" before an audience - and he had an enormous capacity for friendship. Above all, Dan loved his family, his beloved wife Pat, his six sons, and his nine grandchildren. Dan was born in Minneapolis, MN, in 1928, the son of Dan Breen, Sr. and Helen Frances Brady. Dan took great pride in his Irish-Catholic heritage and was a great fan of Notre Dame sports. From his father he learned to respect all people, regardless of their station in life. From his mother, who dabbled in the stock market, he developed an early interest in investments. He attended Rockhurst University in Kansas City, MO, where he was two-time captain of the basketball team. After earning a degree in business administration Dan entered the Army, mustering out in 1953. He then joined IBM as a marketing representative, the first step in a long and successful career in business. While working for IBM in New York City, Dan noticed a strikingly beautiful young woman, Pat McCloskey. On the 11th of February 1961, they were married in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. This past February they celebrated their 55th wedding anniversary. At IBM Dan rose through the ranks, eventually serving as director of sales promotion and co-director of industry marketing at the firm's world headquarters in New York. But the then-nascent field of investment management outside bank trust departments fascinated Dan, and in 1968 he joined National Securities and Research, a Wall Street mutual fund company, as senior vice president. Two years later, in a pivotal development in Dan's professional life, Fayez Sarofim, a rising young money manager in Houston, persuaded Dan to join him as a partner in Fayez Sarofim & Co. The two formed a close, complementary professional relationship, with Sarofim's stock-picking acumen complemented by Dan's management and marketing skills. When Dan joined the firm it had $600 million in assets under management. Over their 13 year association, during which Dan served as President of the company in addition to being Chairman of its Portfolio Management Group and a member of the Board of Directors, that figure grew to $14.5 billion. Dan took great pride in his association with Fayez Sarofim & Co. and in its accomplishments, but he always nursed the ambition of owning his own firm, and in 1983, at the age of 54, he struck out on his own, founding Daniel Breen & Co. By 1997 Daniel Breen & Co. and Breen Trust Co. had close to $3.5 billion assets under management. Major clients included Rice University, Rockhurst University, Davidson College, Wesleyan University, Rockefeller Dodge Foundation, Lincoln Center, New York Telephone, and Coca-Cola of New York. In that year Dan sold the two firms to Banque Indosuez. Some years later he started Breen Investors LP, transitioning ownership to two sons. At the time of his death he was Chairman Emeritus and adviser. During his career, Dan managed assets for more than 25 of the top 100 companies in the world. In the last years of his life he took particular pride in organizing the Our Future Speaker Series, in which he and his professional and personal friends - all high-achievers in their fields - traveled to Houston-area schools to offer career-development advice to kids graduating from high school and college. Left to mourn Dan's passing are his wife Pat; his sons Daniel Breen III and wife Dionne and their children Diandra and Daniel IV; John Breen and wife Zoe and their sons Jack and Dashiell; Thomas Breen and wife Chesie and their daughters Virginia, Eliza and Margaret; Brian Breen; Patrick Breen and wife Erin and son Declan; and Michael Breen and wife Erin and son Andrew. Survivors also include his brother Michael Breen and sister Nancy Creel and husband Walter; sister-in-law Jackie Donovan; and many nieces and nephews. Dan's professional affiliations over the years included: Member, Knights of Malta; Georgetown University Board of Regents; Rockhurst College Board of Trustees; Chairman of the Board, Strake Jesuit College Preparatory; President of the Board, St. Joseph's Hospital; Board of Houston Museum of Natural Science; and Pacific Rim Board, Banque Indosuez. He was a member of the Houston Country Club; Maidstone Club, East Hampton, New York; National Golf Links of America, Southampton, New York; Lyford Cay Club, Nassau, Bahamas. Family and friends gathered in Houston this past Thursday, the 30th of June, to celebrate Dan's life during a Mass of Christian Burial at St. Anne Catholic Church, followed by the Rite of Committal at Glenwood Cemetery. Honored to serve as casket bearers during the services were Milton Carroll, Donald Chapoton, Gordon Johnson, Johnny Johnson, Anthony Petrello, and Robert Whilden.

He received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from our institution where he served as the Professor of Professional Rabbinics in the Chair established by members of Beth Jacob Congregation of Beverly Hills, where he served from 1972 to 1985 as spiritual leader before retiring from the congregation. He then established the Palm Springs Desert Synagogue and served as its rabbi for several years. Earlier, after graduating from RIETS, he started as a Chaplain in the United States Armed Forces and following that began his career as a pulpit rabbi in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Earlier, while in New York, he served as Rabbi of the Floral Park Synagogue and the Hebrew institute of University Heights in the Bronx. While there, he helped the other rabbis in the Bronx/Riverdale area and their lay leaders to establish the SAR Academy. His rabbinic career was capped by his founding and serving as the President of the National Institute of Jewish Hospice in 1985, in which his beloved wife, Shirley Lamm, assisted him. He was world renowned as the author of some five significant books; the first and most famous is The Jewish Way in Death and Mourning, of which 275,000 copies were sold, helping many more thousands of families cope with their bereavement. His other books are The Jewish Way in Love and Marriage, Becoming a Jew, The Power of Hope and Consolation. His kindness, warmth, wisdom and genuine concern for strengthening Jewish life was shared with young rabbinic colleagues in the field, whom he visited as a consultant under the Jack E. and Rachel Gindi Rabbinic Mentoring Program at RIETS. He was the proud younger brother of Rabbi Dr. Norman Lamm, President Emeritus of Yeshiva University, who served for 27 years as President, and of their cherished sisters, Tzibby Citner and Miriam Auslander. He was devoted to his beloved wife, Shirley Lamm, his Ayshet Chayil, a veritable ""Woman of Valor,"" who helped him survive serious illness for many years. He was the revered father of his loving children, David Lamm, Judith Young, of blessed memory, and Dodi Lee Lamm, and the doting grandfather of 18 grandchildren and 35 great- grandchildren, all of whom carry on his legacy of love and concern for their Torah heritage, which he inspired. Heartfelt condolences are extended to Shirley Lamm, their wonderful children and all their progeny and their former congregants whose lives were touched by this unique leader of the Jewish people. May they be comforted among all who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, President Emeritus 1/3"

Richard Blaine Madden, a resident of Ross, California for the past 40+ years, died peacefully at home, surrounded by his loving family on Saturday, June 25, 2016. He is survived by his wife of 58 years Joan Madden, his children John Madden, Lynne McDonough, Kathryn Pandes, Andrew Madden, and their spouses and 10 grandchildren. Dick was born in Short Hills, New Jersey, attended Portsmouth Abbey School and graduated from Princeton University with a BSE degree in 1951. Following his graduation he served in the U.S. Navy from 1951-54 as a LTJG. Dick then attended the University of Michigan Law School, where he received his J.D. degree and met his wife Joan. They were married in 1958. He began his business career with Mobil in New York City while attending NYU at night, receiving his graduate business degree and later teaching there. Early in his 15 years with Mobil, he and his family moved to Rochester, NY where Dick served as President of Mobil-Plastics. He moved back to New York to become Group V.P. of MobiI Chemical and head of the company's Virginia Carolina Chemical Corp. He then served as Assistant Treasurer of Mobil Oil and Chairman of Mobil Oil Estates. In 1971, Dick, Joan and their family moved to Ross, California and Dick became President and Chief Executive Officer of Potlatch Corporation, a Fortune 500 company in the forest products industry. In 1977 he became Chairman and CEO. Dick ran Potlatch for 23 years. The Corporation consistently outperformed the S&P 500 and forest products return on investment indexes throughout this period. In 1972, Dick joined the Board of the American Enterprise Institute and served there until his death. He was Chairman of AEI for six years in the 1980's. Also, in 1972, Dick joined the San Francisco Symphony Board. He first chaired the long-range planning committee that established the need for a symphony hall and went on from there to chair and serve on many other committees until he retired in 2014 as a Life Governor. Dick also served on numerous other corporate and nonprofit boards.

He served as President of the Western Association for six years. He became Vice-Regent of the Order's Sub-Priory of Our Lady of Philermo and was awarded the Grand Cross in Obedience and the Grand Cross of Merit. He often said that the most rewarding aspect of membership in the Order of Malta was helping others in need. Dick was a member of the Metropolitan Club in Washington D.C., the Bohemian Club, The Villa Taverna, Lagunitas Country Club, and San Francisco Fly Casting Club. With all this, Dick found the time to be a loving husband and father to his family. His wife and children remember fondly his help and advice in projects great and small. He will be sorely missed.

2016-07-03T00:00:00Z,"KOBLINER--Shirley (nee Cohen), passed away on July 1, surrounded by her loving family: her husband of 65 years, Harold Kobliner, who was her best friend, confidant and soul mate; her son, Perry Kobliner; her son and daughter-in-law, Kenneth and Miriam Kobliner; and her daughter and son-in-law, Beth Kobliner Shaw and David Shaw. Shirley was a spectacular wife, mother and grandmother, who cherished, more than would seem humanly possible, her husband, children, children-in-law and six grandchildren, Rebecca, Adam, Benjamin, Joshua, Sarah and Jacob. Shirley and Harold's marriage was a miraculous one in their unwavering support and admiration for each other. Theirs was a true love. He was her number one, and she was his. Anyone who ever crossed paths with them knows how extraordinary their beautiful union was. Shirley adored being a wife, mother and grandmother, and relished that experience with genuine joy, humor and zest. She was good, honest and kind, and encouraged her children always. Born in 1929 in Astoria, Queens, Shirley treasured childhood days spent with her mother Belle, father Ben, sister Betty, and brother Murray, who died at age 10. It was a time when resources were scarce, but love was abundant. Shirley would often recall fondly how much she loved helping her father weigh and measure the medications he dispensed at his business, Cohen's Pharmacy, and it was there that her love of chemistry took root. Shirley graduated with a Bachelor of Science in chemistry from Queens College in 1951. When she was 16 years old, at the encouragement of her mother, she attended a dance at the 92nd Street Y, where she met Harold Kobliner, then 17, who was from the Bronx. It turned out to be well worth the three subway trains and a bus that Harold had had to take to get there, since he won Shirley over, and they were married in 1951. Shirley taught chemistry in the New York City public high schools, and she was a wonderful support to Harold as he went on to get his Ph.D. in education. ""I could never have done it without her,"" he would say to everyone they met, adding that she was his inspiration. After raising their three children in Bayside, Queens, Harold and Shirley moved to Great Neck, Long Island. As a member of Temple Israel, Shirley embarked on a series of roles in the Temple Israel Players' productions such as Oklahoma!, Fiddler on the Roof and Guys & Dolls, in which she played a Hot Box girl. Shirley also volunteered countless hours for the Association for Neurologically Impaired Brain Injured Children (ANIBIC) in Queens, where she was honored for her hard work and dedication. Funeral services will take place at 11am on Sunday, July 3, at Riverside-Nassau North Chapel, 55 North Station Plaza, Great Neck, New York. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research by mail at P.O.

He enjoyed the arts, especially ballet, and regularly attended the theater and opera. Jay thoroughly enjoyed many aspects of his life, and people he encountered from all walks of life all found him to be exceptionally charming, witty and a great raconteur.

2016-07-05T00:00:00Z,"TAYLOR--Jack Crawford, of St. Louis, Missouri, died July 2, 2016, at the age of 94. Beloved father of Andrew C. (Barbara) Taylor and Jo Ann Taylor Kindle (Tom Caruso); devoted grandfather of Alison Kindle (Kyle) Hogan, Carolyn Kindle (Adam) Betz, Christine Taylor (Lee) Broughton, Kelly Taylor and Patricia Taylor (Andy Magee); and cherished great- grandfather of Grace and Amelia Broughton and Kylie Hogan. Taylor was the founder of Enterprise Holdings, which through its Enterprise Rent-A-Car, National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car brands is the largest and most comprehensive service provider in the car rental industry. Born and raised in St. Louis, Taylor served his country as a decorated Navy fighter pilot in World War II before returning home to build the company his family still owns and operates. In 1957, he launched a small, auto leasing operation with seven vehicles in the lower level of a Cadillac dealership--expanding to daily car rental a few years later as an additional service to customers. In the decades to come, he turned his start-up into one of the business world's greatest success stories. As the rest of the industry focused on serving airports, Taylor pioneered the ""home city"" car rental market. By renting cars from convenient, neighborhood locations to meet a variety of customer needs, Enterprise quietly but steadily developed a market segment that grew to be as large as or larger than the airport-based rental market. Today, Enterprise Holdings owns three of the most successful car rental brands in the world, a fleet of 1.7 million vehicles and offers extensive car rental and car-sharing services, truck rental, corporate fleet management and retail car sales. Taylor built his company on a simple philosophy: ""Take care of your customers and your employees first, and the profits will follow."" And indeed they did. Over the years, his passion for the business was equaled only by his devotion to his family and his generosity to his beloved home town. Through the years, Taylor--whose charitable giving ranked him No. 11 on The Chronicle of Philanthropy's 2015 ""Philanthropy 50"" list of America's top donors--made many notable private contributions to several of St. Louis's leading civic and cultural not-for-profit institutions, notably the St. Louis Public Schools Foundation, the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, the Missouri Botanical Garden, Forest Park Forever and the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. Other local beneficiaries of his family's and his company's generosity have included St. Louis Children's Hospital, the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis, the St. Louis Zoo, the St. Louis Art Museum, the St. Louis Science Center, Harris-Stowe State University, Saint Louis University, the University of Missouri-St. Louis, Our Little Haven and Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital. In his integrity, optimism and spirit of service, Jack Taylor was a shining example of the ""Greatest Generation."" With his passing, St. Louis has lost one of its greatest friends and benefactors.

2016-07-05T00:00:00Z,"OLICK--Arthur, died on July 2 in Bethesda, Maryland of multiple sclerosis (M.S.). He was 85. He will be remembered as a loving husband, devoted father, grandfather, and brother, and an attorney with few equals. Rising from modest beginnings in the Bronx in New York City, he forged a legal career of unusual accomplishment that included study at Yale University (B.A. 1952; J.D. 1955), public service in the U.S. Army (1956-57) and the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York (1962-68), and private practice at several Manhattan law firms, most notably Anderson, Kill & Olick from which he retired. Through the course of a wide-ranging career he represented both local municipalities and prominent cultural figures, became one of the nation's leading experts on insurance coverage litigation, and was known to many as a lawyer's lawyer, as evidenced by his representation of law firms in high-profile bankruptcy proceedings. Arthur Seymour Olick was born on June 15, 1931 to Anita Babsky and Jacob (Jack) Olick, both first generation Americans born in New York City. Jack was a technical writer who was also what is now called an ""early adopter"" of new technologies, thanks to which Arthur was one of only a handful of Americans who learned of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 via television. He graduated from Evander Childs High School at age 16 before going on to study political science at Yale where he graduated magna cum laude and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He also excelled at Yale Law School where he was a moot court champion. It was at Yale where Arthur met and, in 1954, married Selma Ada Kaufman of New Haven. They were married for 62 years, during which Selma was Art's constant companion, mother to the couple's two children, Robert (born 1957) and Karen (born 1961), and, in later years as his M.S. progressed, Art's caregiver and advocate. Upon relocating to New York following his Army service, Art entered private practice for several years before joining the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York under Robert Morgenthau, where he worked for six years (1962-68), the last three as Chief of the Civil Division. He returned to private practice as a partner at several law firms before joining the firm of Gene Anderson, his former colleague at the U.S. Attorney's Office. Together, Anderson, Olick, and other attorneys at the firm became nationally recognized for their innovative litigation strategies on behalf of insurance policyholders seeking coverage for personal injuries and other damages related to exposure to asbestos. He also served as managing partner of the firm, lectured frequently on trial practice, partnerships, product liability, and business bankruptcy, and represented Zsa Zsa Gabor, Peter Max, Don McLean, Meatloaf, and Gloria Swanson on various commercial matters. Throughout his years of private practice, however, Arthur was continually inspired by the call of public service. He was very active in civic affairs in Westchester County where the family lived for most of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, serving as attorney for several local townships. It was in this capacity that he engaged in a series of court cases to deny tax-exempt status under state and local laws for Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church. In one case, Arthur won a court order to cross-examine Moon, leading the Unification Church to quickly settle. In addition, he served as president of the Greenburg Central Seven School District, leading the implementation of a controversial busing program in the 1970s. He and Selma were also founding members of Bet Am Shalom, a Reconstructionist temple in White Plains. The family built a weekend home in Putnam Valley where they spent many weekends with family and friends, and where, true to his deep sense of patriotism, Art raised and lowered the American flag on national holidays to recorded military music. In retirement, Art and Selma spent part of the year in Florida and as much time as possible every year enjoying theater, opera, and their grandchildren. Arthur was defined by a lifelong drive to learn, to lead, and to serve. He pursued great passions with great energy, led nearly every institution in which he served, set high standards and expectations for colleagues and his family members alike, and, by any measure, achieved the success associated with the American Dream in which he so fervently believed. Arthur is survived by his children Robert (Manlius, NY) and Karen (Washington, DC), her husband John Gibson, and five grandchildren, Joshua, Sarah, Rachel, Stephen, and Grant, and his brothers Phillip (New York City) and David (San Francisco). His wife Selma preceded him in death earlier this year. Services Thursday, July 7th, at 11am at Riverside Chapel, Manhattan. Family will be receiving at the Yale Club at 50 Vanderbilt Avenue on Thursday from 5-8pm. Donations may be made in Arthur's name to the Multiple Sclerosis Society. 1/3"

2016-07-06T00:00:00Z,"CARR--Helen B.,(nee Trainer), beloved wife, devoted mother, nurturing grandmother, loving sister, thoughtful aunt and faithful friend, died peacefully at her home in Southampton, NY on June 11, 2016, just 12 days before her 95th birthday. Helen was born June 23, 1921 in Central Falls, CT to Harold A. Trainer and Sarah E. Trainer (nee Fraser). Her family moved to Coventry, RI, where she graduated from Coventry High School, earning the senior superlative of ""Miss Dependable"". As an active 4H member, Helen was featured on radio programming as ""Peggy Clover"". Choosing to study nursing, she graduated from The Memorial Hospital School of Nursing in Pawtucket, RI. Helen garnered special recognition for her speed and proficiency administering The Sister Kenny treatment to patients victimized by Polio. While visiting family in Helen's care, Peter F. Carr asked Helen to a hospital dance. They would later marry January 30, 1945. Helen chose a career as a public health nurse, visiting neighborhoods and homes in service of the poor and disadvantaged. Peter, Helen and their son Peter, Jr. traveled The Thoroughbred Racing circuit eventually settling in New York. After welcoming a second child, Helen stopped working outside the home in nursing. However, she did become the ""neighborhood nurse"", ready to provide first aid, wipe a tear or apply a Band-Aid. As their family grew, they continued to travel for Peter's career in racing. This took them to Hialeah, Florida in the winter and Saratoga, NY during the summer but Long Island was home. Along with her husband, Helen conceptualized and created a health care insurance program for the New York State Jockey Agent's Benevolent Association. A program Helen administered long after her husband's death. Although she hadn't played for years, Helen developed a love of golf which she shared with her husband. Whether attending a symphony at Carnegie Hall, a ballet at The Met, cabaret at The Algonquin or a Broadway show, Helen loved music and the arts. Her love for poetry, both reading and writing lasted throughout her lifetime. With her ability to make friends easily, she was treasured by everyone who knew her. Dedication to her family was at the core of everything she did throughout her life. She was an extraordinarily caring person. Helen will be sadly missed by her daughter Karen and her wife Yvette Christofilis of Westchester, NY, her daughter Sharon of Southampton, NY, her cherished brother Arthur of Coventry, RI, grandson Kevin of Arkansas, dear friends and relatives. Helen was predeceased by her husband, Peter Sr. in 1985 and her son, Peter Jr. in 2014. A Funeral Mass and graveside memorial service in Coventry, RI, will be announced at a future date.

2016-07-06T00:00:00Z,"OLICK--Arthur, died on July 2 in Bethesda, Maryland of multiple sclerosis (M.S.). He was 85. He is remembered as a loving husband, devoted father, grandfather, and brother, and an attorney with few equals. From modest beginnings in the Bronx, NY, he forged a legal career of unusual accomplishment that included study at Yale University (B.A. 1952; J.D. 1955), public service in the U.S. Army (1956-57) and the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York (1962-68), and private practice at several Manhattan law firms, most notably Anderson, Kill & Olick from which he retired. During his wide-ranging career he represented both local municipalities and prominent cultural figures, became one of the nation's leading experts on insurance coverage litigation and bankdruptcy law, and was known to many as a lawyer's lawyer, as evidenced by his representation of law firms in high-profile bankruptcy proceedings. Arthur Seymour Olick was born on June 15, 1931 to Anita Babsky and Jacob (Jack) Olick, both first generation Americans born in New York City. Jack was a technical writer and an ""early adopter"" of new technologies, thanks to which Arthur was among a handful of Americans who learned of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 via television. He graduated from Evander Childs High School at age 16 before going on to study political science at Yale, graduating magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. He also excelled at Yale Law School where he was a moot court champion. While at Yale, Arthur met and, in 1954, married Selma Ada Kaufman of New Haven. They were married for 62 years, during which Selma was Art's constant companion, mother to the couple's two children, Robert (born 1957) and Karen (born 1961), and, in later years as his M.S. progressed, Art's caregiver and advocate. Following his Army service, Arthur entered private practice in New York City for several years before joining the U.S. Attorney's Office under Robert Morgenthau, where he worked for six years, the last three as Chief of the Civil Division. He returned to private practice as a partner at several law firms before joining the firm of Gene Anderson, his former colleague at the U.S. Attorney's Office. Together, Anderson, Olick, and their colleagues became nationally recognized for their innovative litigation strategies on behalf of insurance policyholders seeking coverage for personal injuries and other damages related to asbestos exposure. Arthur also served as managing partner of the firm, lectured frequently on trial practice, partnerships, product liability, and business bankruptcy, and represented Zsa Zsa Gabor, Peter Max, Don McLean, Meatloaf, and Gloria Swanson on various commercial matters. Throughout his years of private practice, however, Arthur was continually inspired by the call of public service. He was very active in civic affairs in Westchester County where the family lived for most of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, serving as attorney for several local townships. It was in this capacity that he engaged in a series of court cases to deny tax-exempt status under state and local laws for Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church. In one case, Arthur won a court order to cross-examine Moon, leading the Unification Church to quickly settle. In addition, he served as president of the Greenburgh Central Seven School District board of education, leading the implementation of a controversial busing program in the 1970s. He and Selma were also founding members of Bet Am Shalom, a Reconstructionist temple in White Plains. Arthur was defined by a lifelong drive to learn, to lead, and to serve. He pursued great passions with great energy, led nearly every institution in which he served, set high standards and expectations for colleagues and his family members alike, and, by any measure, achieved the success associated with the American Dream in which he so fervently believed. Arthur is survived by his children Robert (Manlius, NY) and Karen (Washington, DC), her husband John Gibson, and five grandchildren, Joshua, Sarah, Rachel, Stephen, and Grant, and his brothers Phillip (New York City) and David (San Francisco). His wife Selma preceded him in death earlier this year. Services Thursday, July 7th, at 11am at Riverside Chapel, Manhattan. Family will be receiving at the Yale Club at 50 Vanderbilt Avenue on Thursday from 5-8pm. Donations may be made in Arthur's name to the Multiple Sclerosis Society. 1/3"

2016-07-06T00:00:00Z,"TAYLOR--Jack Crawford, of St. Louis, Missouri, died July 2, 2016, at the age of 94. Beloved father of Andrew C. (Barbara) Taylor and Jo Ann Taylor Kindle (Tom Caruso); devoted grandfather of Alison Kindle (Kyle) Hogan, Carolyn Kindle (Adam) Betz, Christine Taylor (Lee) Broughton, Kelly Taylor and Patricia Taylor (Andy Magee); and cherished great- grandfather of Grace and Amelia Broughton and Kylie Hogan. Taylor was the founder of Enterprise Holdings, which through its Enterprise Rent-A-Car, National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car brands is the largest and most comprehensive service provider in the car rental industry. Born and raised in St. Louis, Taylor served his country as a decorated Navy fighter pilot in World War II before returning home to build the company his family still owns and operates. In 1957, he launched a small, auto leasing operation with seven vehicles in the lower level of a Cadillac dealership--expanding to daily car rental a few years later as an additional service to customers. In the decades to come, he turned his start-up into one of the business world's greatest success stories. As the rest of the industry focused on serving airports, Taylor pioneered the ""home city"" car rental market. By renting cars from convenient, neighborhood locations to meet a variety of customer needs, Enterprise quietly but steadily developed a market segment that grew to be as large as or larger than the airport-based rental market. Today, Enterprise Holdings owns three of the most successful car rental brands in the world, a fleet of 1.7 million vehicles and offers extensive car rental and car-sharing services, truck rental, corporate fleet management and retail car sales. Taylor built his company on a simple philosophy: ""Take care of your customers and your employees first, and the profits will follow."" And indeed they did. Over the years, his passion for the business was equaled only by his devotion to his family and his generosity to his beloved home town. Through the years, Taylor--whose charitable giving ranked him No. 11 on The Chronicle of Philanthropy's 2015 ""Philanthropy 50"" list of America's top donors--made many notable private contributions to several of St. Louis's leading civic and cultural not-for-profit institutions, notably the St. Louis Public Schools Foundation, the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, the Missouri Botanical Garden, Forest Park Forever and the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. Other local beneficiaries of his family's and his company's generosity have included St. Louis Children's Hospital, the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis, the St. Louis Zoo, the St. Louis Art Museum, the St. Louis Science Center, Harris-Stowe State University, Saint Louis University, the University of Missouri-St. Louis, Our Little Haven and Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital. In his integrity, optimism and spirit of service, Jack Taylor was a shining example of the ""Greatest Generation."" With his passing, St. Louis has lost one of its greatest friends and benefactors. Funeral service private. The family requests that donations be made to the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, 975 N. Warson Road, St. Louis, MO 63132; Forest Park Forever, 5595 Grand Drive, St. Louis, MO 63103; or the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, 718 North Grand Blvd., St. Louis, MO, 63103.

Born in New York City in 1946 to Whit and Hallie Burnett, Whitney began her career as an opera singer, performing as a mezzo-soprano in houses that included her cherished Santa Fe Opera. She then became the casting director for the soap operas The Edge of Night and Search for Tomorrow, where she took joy in casting young aspiring actors. Later, building on her experience as a board member for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and while raising three sons, she served as a fundraiser for The Women's Project Theater, as the development director of the Harlem School of the Arts, and finally, for 13 wonderful years, as the executive director of The National Foundation for Facial Reconstruction, where she supported treatment for children with facial differences. Tireless even as she battled cancer, Whitney continued to serve those in need as a tutor and mentor to homeless youth through The Doe Fund. Only months ago, and just a week removed from a hospital bed, Whitney even traveled to Jordan to work with torture victims in refugee camps. Having lovingly raised three sons, in 2005 Whitney met her beloved husband Michael MacLeod, whom she cared for devotedly until he died in 2014. Whitney is survived by her three sons, McCaleb Burnett, Philip Voss, and Jeremy Voss; daughter-in-law, Brooksie Voss; and brother, John Burnett.

2016-07-07T00:00:00Z,"MARSHALL--Louis, age 93, died in his home in Houston, TX on July 5, 2016. He was born in Manhattan, NY November 22, 1922, the third child of Bessie and Max Marshall. He was raised in Brooklyn, NY. He completed his B.S. in Chemical Engineering at City College of New York in 1944 with highest honors. At CCNY he served as president of the student chapter of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and as treasurer of the Tau Beta Pi chapter (the honorary fraternity for engineering). Lou had two extraordinary passions, engineering and family. Lou approached engineering with an abiding curiosity that drove him to unravel phenomena that many would not even notice. He had a methodical attention to detail - careful analysis of multiple possibilities - and a keen awareness of how a given plant design could go wrong. As a chemical engineer, he initially worked as a plant operator for Shell Oil, but moved to a position with Lummus Engineering in 1950 to focus on petrochemical plant design, his passion. He remained with Lummus for 35 years, where he became known as the ""Engineer's Engineer."" His colleagues looked to Lou as a trouble shooter who could determine the source of problems and devise solutions. At his retirement dinner, a younger colleague said that he learned more about engineering from Lou Marshall than from his entire university training. Early on, Lou recognized the power of the digital computer to transform the practice of chemical engineering. He pioneered some of the first uses of linear programming to optimize petrochemical plant operation, and did initial work applying nonlinear programming to similar problems. After retiring from Lummus in 1986, he continued an extensive consulting practice applying linear optimization techniques to petrochemical plant operation. Lou's other great passion was his family. In 1945 he married his best friend and college sweetheart, Faith Gladstone. Their 71 years of marriage were an inspiration to all who knew them. In addition to being survived by Faith, Lou is also survived by their two children, Ellen Ruth Marshall, attorney in Orange County, CA (Robert Arnold, attorney), and David Aaron Marshall, economist in Chicago, IL (Maija Freimanis, physician) and their two grandchildren, Astrid Carla Marshall, medical student in Manhattan, NY (Jefferson Li, business student) and Max Benjamin Marshall, jazz pianist in New York. Lou served as a role model for his children and grandchildren, encouraging a passion for science and math, and conveying his deep love of music, photography, and woodworking. In a letter to his children on the occasion of his 90th birthday, he wrote, ""If Mom and I have been examples to you in the way we have lived our lives, then I am doubly satisfied."" The family acknowledges with special gratitude the loving care provided by Catalina Alvarez in recent years. The funeral will be held Friday, July 8, 2016 at 11am at the Proler Family Chapel at Beth Israel Memorial Gardens Cemetery, 1101 Antoine, Houston, TX. The family requests that any remembrances be made as memorial contributions to Congregation Beth Israel, Houston, TX, or to an educational or charitable organization of your choice. 1/3"

2016-07-07T00:00:00Z,"DUGGAL--Baldev. The Passing of a Visionary New York Businessman. Baldev Duggal (August 17, 1937 - June 29, 2016), a visionary entrepreneur, who over five decades built several iconic NYC businesses, including Duggal Visual Solutions and The Duggal Greenhouse, passed away peacefully in his sleep early last Wednesday morning, only days after an advance celebration of his upcoming 79th birthday with his family. Duggal was a proud New Yorker and a living manifestation of the American Dream. An immigrant, he came to the United States by himself from India in 1957 with only $200 in his pocket and managed to translate his last name into a global brand in the arts, graphics and media world. Made in India: In 1947, in Duggal's formative years, India won its independence. During the struggles that preceded independence, his father, Biasdev Duggal, an insurance manager, was imprisoned as a local leader for peaceful resistance to British rule. As a boy, Duggal learned a powerful lesson on the power of individuals to make change against the odds. The Land of Opportunity: Duggal arrived in New York Harbor in 1957, alone and with $200 in his pocket to start his new life. Coming from a then small village in India, far from being intimidated by the size and vibrancy of New York City he was energized by it. It began a lifetime love affair with the city he lived in until his death. He managed to get work in photo print shops and as a cameraman for famed NYC television correspondent Gabe Pressman. Whatever barriers existed for young 'third-world' immigrants in the 1950s, he simply couldn't afford to be hindered by them. It wasn't long before he started his own business, Duggal Color Projects. He was hand developing film in a bathtub in a basement apartment in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Soon the legends like Marcel Duchamp, Bert Stern, and Richard Avedon were giving him jobs. His lab was the go-to place for artists in the 1960s. One of his favorite anecdotes of those days was when Andy Warhol's studio once offered to pay him in-kind with original paintings, but he declined as he needed the cash for his struggling small business. The new challenge for Duggal became how to scale his business. Hand-processing film was slow and tedious but was far superior to the automated processes of the day which yielded dull whites. He knew there could be something better and he invented a revolutionary process for film development, the ""dip-and-dunk"" machine, that combined the quality of hand processing with the efficiency and consistency of a mechanical process. This marriage of art and science would be something he would repeat and be known for throughout his life. Vision, Timing and Tenacity: By 1970, his business had grown so much he needed more space. Seeking lower real estate prices, he moved to a 12-story building in Chelsea that he later purchased, in an area that later became 'The Photo District', as other labs and camera shops opened around him to share in the market Duggal was building. At this point, Duggal Color Projects had already expanded into a comprehensive film processing, printing and finishing company that could handle a wide range of jobs for photographers, advertising firms, museums, and corporations. To stay on top, Duggal kept innovating and adding new services for his burgeoning clientele. In the 1980s Duggal saw the potential for Digital services to transform the industry, and he pioneered early electronic retouching services and became the first commercial lab to feature drum scanning technology. While that business took a long time to grow, his early investments gave him a head start and experience no one else had. In the last decades, while many others, including Kodak, failed to make the transition to Digital, Duggal was already an established industry leader with a litany of pioneering firsts. Along the way, Duggal had to ride out many economic downturns, 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Events that would take him and his Company to the brink, but he embodied the toughness New Yorkers are famous for and kept coming back stronger. Today Duggal Visual Solutions, Inc. employs over 350 dedicated employees and boasts over 250,000 square feet of production space in New York City. Green Fields: Never one to stand still, in his 70s, Duggal began to start other businesses. Notably 'The Duggal Greenhouse', formerly a dilapidated warehouse at the Brooklyn Navy Yard he had rehabilitated with an eco-friendly design, and transformed into the pre-eminent event space in New York. The huge, column free space with tremendous views of the New York City skyline has attracted the likes of Beyonce, Nike, Christian Dior and CNN, which recently hosted a Democratic Party Debate at the facility. Duggal's interest in Green Technology as both an opportunity and a way to make a positive impact led him to start Lumisolair. The Man: Baldev Duggal was an upbeat charismatic man, always scanning the horizon for what came next. He took on each day with boundless energy and an optimism, which challenged individuals and teams to achieve more than they believed possible. His dreams found their ideal home in New York City, a place that allowed him to experiment without restraint and bring together his love for art and science into a platform that fundamentally transformed how artists and marketers would communicate with the world. Baldev Duggal is survived by his three children Sue, Dave and Michael and eight grandchildren. He is also survived by his brother Sukhdev Duggal. 1/3"

2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,"POWERS--Peter J.,former First Deputy Mayor of New York City, died this morning (July 7, 2016) at age 72, after a long and valiant fight against cancer. Peter served as the First Deputy Mayor of the City from 1994 to 1996. He is widely credited with initiating and leading the reform of the City under the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. He was also Mayor Giuliani's campaign manager, most important political advisor, and life-long closest friend. Peter James Powers was born in Queens, NY on April 9, 1944 to Thomas and Florence Powers. Peter's dad was Delegate/Organizer for the Retail Clerks' Union. Although Peter came from a union background, he described himself and was a Goldwater Republican and a very proud one. Peter graduated from Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in 1961, Manhattan College in 1965 and New York University Law School in 1968. He also earned an LL.M in taxation from N.Y.U. Law School and he was a Certified Public Accountant. He practiced tax law in New York City for many years before he began his involvement in politics. He was one of the foremost tax lawyers and had a thriving practice, when he left to take over Mayor Giuliani's 1989 run for Mayor at a time of real difficulties. He and Roger Ailes, then Mayor Giuliani's political consultant, are widely credited with guiding the campaign to a landslide victory in the Republican primary and, after beginning the general election run 29% behind, brought the campaign to within 2% of victory. Peter, this time teaming with David Garth, led Mayor Giuliani's campaign to a 2% victory in 1993. The victory was all the more remarkable because it was the largest percentage a Republican had received since Mayor LaGuardia. Peter's organization of a much more effective ground game is considered the difference that led to victory. After Peter Powers left City Hall he remained a close political advisor to Mayor Giuliani and his close friend and, later on, a very trusted business advisor. They handled a number of legal and business engagements together. Peter formed Powers Global Strategies. Through that company he and his partner -- later his wife -- Sylvia Ng, advised many multi-national corporations on government -relations matters. Peter was one of the most sought after consultants in the country. He also served on too many boards to list but, most notably, the boards of Fox Entertainment Group, Manhattan College, and Mutual of America Life Insurance, GFI Corporation, and the Partnership for New York City. He also served as Chairman and Director of Giuliani LLC and as Chairman of the New York City Public Initiatives Corporation. Mayor Giuliani said, ""Peter Powers is one of the main reasons New York City is such a great city today. Without him my administration could not have achieved the reforms and the Bloomberg administration could not have continued and improved on them. He was a great leader, my most important advisor and my friend for 58 years. Everyone in our city owes a debt of gratitude to Peter and today we lost a great American. Judith and I lost a beloved friend, and I lost a brother."" Peter died surrounded by his wife Sylvia, who hadn't left his side during his six week hospitalization, and his loving family. He is survived by his wife, soul-mate, and business partner, Sylvia Ng, his daughters Heather McBride and Krista Harvey, daughters from his previous marriage to Kathleen Ingrassia, his grandchildren Eve, Catalina, Luke and Patrick, his sons-in-law, with whom he had a very close relationship, Scott McBride and Jeff Harvey and two older brothers Don and Jack. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, The Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, NYC, NY on Saturday, July 9th and Sunday, July 10th, 2pm-5pm and 7pm-9pm. The Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Monday, July 11 at 10 am.

2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,"GRAHAM--John Lawrence, passed away on July 5, 2016, having succumbed to the ravages of ALS, with which he struggled for the past two years. He died as he lived his life: on his own terms, surrounded by family and friends, and with a slight grin on his face as he savored the memories of a life well lived. John is survived by his two sons, JW and Rome, of New York City, whom he loved eternally and unconditionally; his mother Barbara Graham Williams of Houston, Texas; his father Jack Graham, of Austin, Texas; his sister Mary Margaret Graham and her wife Sheree Adams of Austin, Texas, who dedicated themselves to supporting John and his boys through this terrible disease and as his life came to a close; and his former wife and the mother of his boys, Michelle Gauthier of New York City. He is also survived by hundreds of friends and colleagues who will miss his quick wit, his hearty laugh and his unfiltered and unapologetic observations on life and the myriad circumstances in which we all find ourselves. The only thing that surpassed John's generosity was his loyalty; and if you were fortunate enough to get into his circle, you soon came to understand that you would never leave it. He will be deeply, deeply missed by all of us, but never forgotten. John was born on October 10, 1962, and grew up in Houston, Texas, where he attended The Kinkaid School and excelled at debate and was a multisport athlete. Following high school, John attended Princeton University, where he will forever be remembered for having founded one of the first Greek fraternities at Princeton in the modern era, the Princeton chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. John was immensely proud of having founded the SAE chapter and to this day, his fraternity brothers remain among his most cherished and loyal friends. After graduating from Princeton with honors, John went to law school at the University of Texas at Austin where he earned his J.D., cum laude. John practiced law for 28 years; first with Baker Botts in Houston, Texas, and New York City; then with King & Spalding in New York City; and ultimately with Clifford Chance in both Abu Dhabi and New York City. He was a highly regarded and accomplished attorney, who focused on mergers, acquisitions and divestitures principally in the telecom and media sectors. John lived in the Tribeca neighborhood for much of the last 15 years, and he could often be found in the bar area of his beloved Wolfgang's sharing a steak dinner with his boys or his friends. Frequently, John presided over late afternoon weekend lunches at Felix on West Broadway, which were the stuff of legend and often extended until the early evening. He traveled extensively throughout his life, spearheading annual guys trips that took John and his cast of characters throughout Europe, including numerous trips to the Greek islands, the Caribbean, Mexico and Central America, Brazil, Africa and the Middle East. His antics and appetite for fun earned him the eternal moniker ""the Crowd Pleaser."" John spent his summers over the past twenty years in the Hamptons where he enjoyed fishing on his boat and relaxing with family and friends on the beach in Amagansett. It was within sight of this beach he loved that he gave his final breath and said goodbye. At John's request, there will not be a public service. A private wake will be scheduled at a future date.

Peter James Powers was born in Queens, NY on April 9, 1944 to Thomas and Florence Powers. Peter's dad was Delegate/Organizer for the Retail Clerks' Union. Although Peter came from a union background, he described himself and was a Goldwater Republican and a very proud one. Peter graduated from Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in 1961, Manhattan College in 1965 and New York University Law School in 1968. He also earned an LL.M in taxation from N.Y.U. Law School and he was a Certified Public Accountant. He practiced tax law in New York City for many years before he began his involvement in politics. He was one of the foremost tax lawyers and had a thriving practice, when he left to take over Mayor Giuliani's 1989 run for Mayor at a time of real difficulties. He and Roger Ailes, then Mayor Giuliani's political consultant, are widely credited with guiding the campaign to a landslide victory in the Republican primary and, after beginning the general election run 29% behind, brought the campaign to within 2% of victory. Peter, this time teaming with David Garth, led Mayor Giuliani's campaign to a 2% victory in 1993. The victory was all the more remarkable because it was the largest percentage a Republican had received since Mayor LaGuardia. Peter's organization of a much more effective ground game is considered the difference that led to victory. After Peter Powers left City Hall he remained a close political advisor to Mayor Giuliani and his close friend and, later on, a very trusted business advisor. They handled a number of legal and business engagements together. Peter formed Powers Global Strategies. Through that company he and his partner -- later his wife -- Sylvia Ng, advised many multi-national corporations on government -relations matters. Peter was one of the most sought after consultants in the country. He also served on too many boards to list but, most notably, the boards of Fox Entertainment Group, Manhattan College, and Mutual of America Life Insurance, GFI Corporation, and the Partnership for New York City. He also served as Chairman and Director of Giuliani LLC and as Chairman of the New York City Public Initiatives Corporation. Mayor Giuliani said, ""Peter Powers is one of the main reasons New York City is such a great city today. Without him my administration could not have achieved the reforms and the Bloomberg administration could not have continued and improved on them. He was a great leader, my most important advisor and my friend for 58 years. Everyone in our city owes a debt of gratitude to Peter and today we lost a great American. Judith and I lost a beloved friend, and I lost a brother."" Peter died surrounded by his wife Sylvia, who hadn't left his side during his six week hospitalization, and his loving family. He is survived by his wife, soul-mate, and business partner, Sylvia Ng, his daughters Heather McBride and Krista Harvey, daughters from his previous marriage to Kathleen Ingrassia, his grandchildren Eve, Catalina, Luke and Patrick, his sons-in-law, with whom he had a very close relationship, Scott McBride and Jeff Harvey and two older brothers Don and Jack. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, The Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, NYC, NY on Saturday, July 9th and Sunday, July 10th, 2pm-5pm and 7pm-9pm. The Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Monday, July 11 at 10 am. Peter asked that anyone wanting to make a contribution send it to Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School or Manhattan College. 1/3"

The Board of Directors, Overseers and staff of the International Rescue Committee are deeply saddened by the loss of Elie Wiesel, Holocaust survivor and memory keeper of the victims of Nazi persecution who used his moral authority as a Nobel Laureate to focus attention on global atrocities and the plight of refugees. He was a longtime supporter of the IRC, an organization founded in 1933 to aid victims of the Nazis, joining the IRC Board in 1985 and the IRC Overseers in 2004. Before joining the IRC Board, Mr. Wiesel was a member of the IRC's Citizens Commission on Indochinese Refugees--a group whose advocacy work helped lead to the passing of the U.S. Refugee Act of 1980. In 1980, Commission members visited a Cambodian refugee camp, where Mr. Wiesel explained, ""I came here because nobody came when I was there. One thing that is worse for the victim than hunger, fear, torture, is the feeling of abandonment, the feeling that nobody cares, the feeling that you don't count."" In 1987, the IRC honored Mr. Wiesel with the Freedom Award, presented by Liv Ullmann, for his ""extraordinary service to humanity, freedom and the cause of refugees.""

2016-07-10T00:00:00Z,"WILSON--Philip D.,Jr., M.D., died peacefully at home on June 29, 2016. He was 96. A man of unbounded wit and charm, Dr. Wilson possessed a warmth of character and caring for others that deeply endeared him to patients, colleagues, friends and family alike. Dr. Wilson was born in 1920 in Boston. His father was a prominent surgeon, his mother a native of France and the daughter of well-known French actress and comedienne, Rejane. His parents met in Paris during World War I. The second of three, Philip and his siblings often travelled to France with their mother on summer holiday. A graduate of the Kent School, ""Ox"" Wilson rowed on the varsity heavyweight crew that won the Thames Challenge Cup at Henley in 1938. Dr. Wilson's collegiate career started as a member of the Harvard class of 1942, but the onset of the Second World War led him to an accelerated MD program at Columbia. Although he will no longer take his daily walk in Central Park, Dr. Wilson is responsible for thousands who still can. He was a pivotal figure in the development and improvement of total hip replacement in the United States. Under his stewardship as Surgeon in Chief from 1972 to 1989, the Hospital For Special Surgery attained international prominence as a leading center of orthopedic care, research and clinical training. In an era when medical practice grew increasingly fast-paced, Dr. Wilson is universally lauded for maintaining a primary emphasis on the personal and human side of patient care. Leisure time often found him on the tennis court or golf course with his beloved late wife of 42 years, Katherine S. Wilson, who died in 2005. Nowhere were his recreational talents more readily apparent, however, than on the water, where the love of sailing he discovered cruising the coast of New England in his youth continued into his last years. Dr. Wilson will long be remembered for his immense love of family, his compassion, intelligence, wisdom, unassuming charm and limitless generosity. He is survived by two daughters, Lucy Watson, Elizabeth Watson and her husband Marc Sydorak, and two sons, David and his wife Janet, and Patrick and his wife Nina. He was preceded in death by his daughter Nicole Beebe and son William Watson. Philip leaves nine grandchildren, Mercy Watson, Brooke Noble, Peter Beebe, Erica and Matthew Wilson, and Gardner, Katherine, Harrison and Leverett Wilson; and two great-grandchildren Callie and Taylor Noble.

The name was later changed to Warwick Advertising, and finally, Warwick, Baker, O'Neill. John served as Chairman and CEO for 33 years and retired in 1991. With over 250 employees at their height in their New York City office, and 75 in their European offices, Warwick became an internationally recognized agency with offices in Paris, London, Frankfurt & Brussels.

She was named to the Board of Trustees at age 22, the youngest person ever to hold that position. The then President Simpson noted on her appointment: ""If anyone can mediate between hairy youth and hoary age, it is Alison Bernstein."" Following Vassar, Alison entered a Ph.D. program in history at Columbia University. In 1974, while working on her dissertation on federal policy and Native Americans, Alison took a position with the Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education [FIPSE] in the US Department of Education. This launched her into a career in education and educational policy. In 1983, Alison joined the Ford Foundation, first as program officer and later as Vice President for Knowledge, Creativity and Freedom. At Ford, Alison became a leader in higher education and a voice for justice across the globe. She was the architect of countless initiatives that promoted a higher quality of education for diverse and marginalized populations. Alison was a vibrant presence; fostering the talents of others and encouraging bold programming pursuits and innovative thinking. Over the course of her life, Alison wrote and co-wrote five books on topics ranging from difference and diversity in South Africa and the United States to the role of philanthropy in higher education. In 2011, after a year at Spelman College, Alison became Director of the Rutgers' Institute for Women's Leadership where she focused particularly on Women and Health and Women, Media and Technology. Alison spent the last years of her life spearheading a campaign to endow the Gloria Steinem Chair in Media, Culture and Feminist Studies. Alison had a recognized jaunty and ebullient style; in moments of passionate conviction, she would wave her eyeglasses, usually perched atop her head. She adored her twins, Emma and Julia and instilled in them both her social justice values and also her unflagging love of life. Alison knew how to throw a party and organized her friends to travel with her. She cultivated a wide range of interests, from musical theater and romantic comedies to book clubs and bird watching. Alison was curious, perceptive and ferociously intelligent, adding a zest for life to every group she joined.

His road to Broadway began in the theater of the Carnegie Library, Homestead, PA, where, from the wings, Tom watched his big sister Vernie perform. As part of the ""Greenfield Gang"" at Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, Tom acted, put on shows, and made lifelong friends. He worked ore boats on the Great Lakes, served in Japan with the US Army, graduated from UCLA, and launched his professional acting career. Swept into the growing regional theater movement, Tom performed all over the country, and was a long time company member at the Alley Theater, Arena Stage and Old Globe. Even as a young actor, his strong talent, plus expertise at make up and wigs brought Tom plum character roles. His special treat was playing the maid or maiden aunt, then thrilling audiences with his curtain call ""reveal."" Tom moved to New York, performed in plays on and off Broadway (notably, A Texas Trilogy, The Good Doctor, The Elephant Man), appeared in film (including multiple Coen Brothers movies) and TV. Then, to his great delight, found himself reborn in middle-age as a ""Song and Dance Man!,"" continuing his career in Broadway musicals, including The Secret Garden, Me and My Girl, and Ragtime. Tom was known for his ability to bring acting companies together, but as a consummate storyteller, he sometimes caused fellow actors to linger too long, and race from the Green Room, barely making their entrance. He loved walking to work from his Manhattan Plaza home, or watching the glow of Times Square and Broadway from the ""tropical retreat"" of his balcony. If ""all the world's a stage,"" Tom designed the set for his own world, magically magnifying his tiny apartment to suit his vision. The fifth of nine children, Tom grew up in a rambunctious, joy-filled, Irish family. His eccentric, free spirit will be forever celebrated by his remaining siblings, Betty Jean, Mary Alice, and Bob, dozens of loving nieces and nephews, his cherished confidants, friends and colleagues.

She was born July 31, 1919 in New York City to Theresa LaGumina Barbieri and Frank Barbieri, both of whom were born in Italy. Frances was raised in Queens, New York and was an honors graduate of Richmond Hill High School, Hunter College and New York University. She played a piano recital at Carnegie Hall in 1933, worked at the 1939 World's Fair and helped ship tanks from New York to Europe during WW II. Frances was predeceased by her parents, her beloved sister Eleanor, and her loving husband of 55 years, Rocco J. Sergi. She leaves her two devoted sons and their spouses, Vincent A.F. Sergi and Debbie (Chicago), Theodore S. Sergi and Barbara (West Hartford, CT), four treasured grandsons: Nicholas and spouse Jennifer Mabary (San Antonio), Gregory (Los Angeles), Justin (New York City) and Julian (Hollywood) and one very wonderful great-granddaughter, Carolyn Marcella Sergi (San Antonio). Frances was one of the greatest school teachers of modern history; elected as the first recipient of the Kew Forest School Hall of Fame in 2004 after 40+ years of teaching fourth grade. Her teaching of reading, writing, math, the multiplication tables, nature (bird projects), the arts, and thesis-like projects for 10-year-olds is legendary. She has been described by her former students as ""stern but loving, tough but fair, demanding but praising"" with a ""no-nonsense classroom atmosphere that demanded that one must respect all others."" Her philosophy was always one of ""You can do it."" The Sergi family would like all her former students to know that she was as great a mom and grandma as she was a teacher. At age 81 she retired from teaching and joined the Kew Forest School Development Office, working until age 88 cajoling her former pupils into making contributions. Frances loved music of all kinds: classical, opera, Frank Sinatra and The Mills Brothers. She was passionate about musical theater and made costumes for school play productions for decades. She loved history and her visits with Rocco to America's great historical sites. And she was proud of her hometown of New York City, its excitement and its international sounds and flavors. She also believed in the curative powers of witch hazel. Frances made a lasting impression on everyone she met, making everyone around her feel included and happy. Frances was devoted to the Church of the Resurrection, Richmond Hill and St. Luke's Church, Forest Hills, and served both in many capacities. Frances was very thankful to the devoted staff of The McAuley and St. Mary Home, West Hartford, CT. where she spent the last eight good years of her 97.

2016-07-12T00:00:00Z,"LOWE--William Webb II, 95, a pioneer in the introduction of nuclear electric power plants in the United States and abroad, died July 4, 2016, at his home in Alexandria, Virginia of cancer. He was a graduate of Purdue University in Chemical Engineering, a Fellow of the American Institute of Chemists, and a member of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the American Chemical Society and the American Nuclear Society. He was also an independent scholar of 17th century English merchant marine history. Lowe was born on December 18, 1920, in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, the son of William Webb Lowe and Grace Evans Lowe. In 1944 he married Mary Jean Sanford of Webster Groves, Missouri. He was preceded in death by his ex-wife, Mary Jean Sanford Lowe; his brothers Lt. Col. Richard Wyche Lowe and Robert Evans Lowe; and one grandchild. He is survived by five children: William Lowe III of Lutz, FL; Judith Lowe of Vienna, VA; Dr. Barbara Lowe-Fierke of Northfield, MN; Dr. Robert Lowe of Lansdale, PA; and Jennifer Lowe Foley of Catlett, VA; fourteen grandchildren; four great grandchildren; his second wife of 42 years, Sylvia Stallings Lowe; and three stepchildren: Dr. Sarah Morris of Los Angeles, CA, Julia Morris Kashkashian of Boulder, CO, and Dr. Michael Morris of Falls Church, VA. In February 1942, two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Lowe volunteered for Army service and was assigned to continue chemical engineering studies at Purdue. In May 1943, he and three others were withdrawn from their units and sent to the University of Pennsylvania for additional engineering courses. In March 1944, with sealed orders, he took seventeen soldiers, all engineers, by train from Philadelphia to Lamy, New Mexico. They were taken by night in an unmarked bus to the now historic 109 East Palace Street atomic bomb project receiving station in Santa Fe, and then to Los Alamos to provide engineering support for scientists. Lowe was chosen by Dr. Arthur Charles Wahl, co-discoverer of plutonium, to help develop methods for producing the extremely pure plutonium thought to be essential for a successful plutonium weapon. Lowe was then 23 years old. Dr. Wahl was 25. Purifying plutonium was considered the second most difficult problem at Los Alamos. Wahl specified the chemistry, Lowe led the team that developed the equipment. By October 1944, they had a process and equipment that worked and Lowe was put in charge of operations. Lowe later wrote: ""I was assigned to supervise receipt and purification of essentially all plutonium made during WWII. In July 1945, I walked down the hall to the metallurgy lab to view with long thoughts the first hemisphere of plutonium, about the size of a baseball, silver coated and resting on a tripod in a dry box."" Dr. Wahl's group was a very small but important part of the enormous enterprise centrally directed and logistically supported by the Manhattan District of the U.S. Corps of Engineers. The project had the highest War Production Board priority. After the war, Lowe received letters of commendation from Major General Groves, leader of the Manhattan Project, and J. Robert Oppenheimer, Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory. He was authorized by the Secretary of War to wear the U.S. Army commendation ribbon. As the Cold War and then Korean War began, Lowe moved to Richland, Washington as Chief of the Nuclear Engineering Section of the Hanford office of the newly created U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. There he initiated a series of critical mass experiments that provided the basis for doubling the plutonium production rate of the original plants. In 1954, he became Chief Nuclear Engineer at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. In 1956, Lowe joined James K. Pickard and Frederick H. Warren as a partner of the engineering firm Pickard, Warren and Lowe and eventually became chairman of it and its successor organizations. In 1960, he and his two partners were cofounders of the Nuclear Utilities Service Corporation. During his career, Lowe worked on behalf of electric power company clients to help select sites, set major design parameters, train people, and conduct safety oversight for a quarter of the 104 nuclear electric power units built in the United States and for several abroad. In the early 1960s, he pioneered the use of quantitative probabilistic risk analysis for choosing nuclear power plant sites and advocated its use for design, construction and operation to identify and reduce the probability of significant accidents. However, when concluding a talk about nuclear power in 1971, he said no new technology had evolved without there being accidents and that ""We must be careful what we do."" After the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident in March 1979, Lowe went to the site at the request of the owners, and was the first to recognize that a massive hydrogen ignition had occurred in the containment, that there was a hydrogen bubble in the primary system, and that the fuel core had been destroyed. He specified procedures for removing the hydrogen bubble in the primary system and other actions to stabilize and analyze the condition of the unit. Aside from his substantial contributions to science and humanity, William Webb Lowe leaves behind a legacy of a generosity of spirit, an unwavering sense of responsibility to those he loved, a firm belief in the importance of honesty, a curiosity about and respect for the forces of nature, a sense of fun and accomplishment in mastering nature, and a fascination in the history of those who have gone before. He now joins his ancestors and though he will be sorely missed, these legacies will live on in those who knew him, and will be passed on to the generations to come. Funeral services will be held on Friday, July 15, 2016 at 2pm at Christ Church, 118 North Washington Street, Alexandria, VA. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Christ Church Foundation Fund: HistoricChristChurch.org. 1/3"

2016-07-12T00:00:00Z,"BRADEMAS--John. The NYU Community deeply mourns the loss of President Emeritus John Brademas, a great humanitarian, statesman, and educator whose vision and leadership helped to fundamentally transform this University. An Indiana native, John joined the US Navy officers training program after high school in 1945, was a Rhodes scholar, worked as an aide to Illinois governor and presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson, and taught political science at Notre Dame before going on to represent Indiana's Third Congressional District in Washington, D.C. for more than two decades, distinguishing himself as a champion of progressive legislation, education, and the arts. When he became the 13th President of NYU in 1981, it was a time of uncertainty for the University, which was only a few years removed from serious financial difficulties. But John did not shrink from the challenge: in 1984, he launched a major, transformative fundraising campaign that succeeded in raising more than $1 billion. He also oversaw the opening of a number of major campus programs and learning centers, including the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, the Casa Italiana Zerilli- Marimo, and the Center for Japan-US Business and Economic Studies. His presidency marked the start of NYU's transformation from a regional university to its present status as a nationally and internationally renowned scholarly and research institution - one of the great success stories in higher education. He continued to be active in public life after stepping down as president - he served as chair of President Clinton's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities and as a member of the New York State Board of Regents. Deeply interested in Spanish history and culture, he was the driving force behind the creation of the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center at NYU, which promotes research and scholarship on Spain and the Spanish- speaking world, and became the Center's first president. He served on NYU's Board of Trustees for 35 years. He was recognized by the University in 2001 with the Albert Gallatin medal, and the John Brademas Center for the Study of Congress was established at the NYU Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service in his honor. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Dr. Mary Ellen Brademas; his sister, Eleanor Brazeau; his stepchildren - Katherine Goldberg, Jane Murray, and John Briggs - and their children - James and Briggs Goldberg, Cameron and John Murray, and Alexandra and Molly Briggs - as well as all of his loved ones and friends. For his leadership, wisdom, dignity, commitment to service, and record of achievements, he will be sorely missed by the NYU community.

2016-07-12T00:00:00Z,"DEUTSCH--Joan. Over the past 18 months, with the support of her family, friends and a dedicated medical team, Joan finally with grace succumbed to brain cancer at age 80 on Sunday, July 10th at her home in Irvington, NY. Joan was born and raised in Brooklyn. She graduated from Erasmus High School and then Brooklyn College with a degree in molecular biology, followed by additional courses at New York University. 60 years ago, at age 21, she was selected by The Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research to join their tumor screening department under the supervision of two early prominent cancer pioneers. As a young woman, Joan too, was also then recognized as a cancer pioneer. During her 18 years there, she co-authored and published 10 scientific papers and contributed to important inter-department research. She was an inspiration and example for her daughters and other young women to emulate her in the field of science. Joan then continued her career at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Einstein College of Medicine. Over the next 14 years, she co-authored and published 11 research papers while collaborating in many other scientific projects. Upon retirement from Einstein she dedicated her remaining years to volunteer work in animal preservation and nature. She spent five years in nutrition research at the Bronx Zoo Veterinary Hospital, followed by 14 years at the Bronx Botanical Garden Research Center conducting a program for the gene sequencing of plants, while mentoring graduates and interns. Joan was a voracious reader who traveled extensively with Marty and friends from Tibet to Alaska and points beyond, enriching her passion for music and the arts while also sampling the local cuisines. She was a skilled cook, a gracious hostess known for her gourmet dinners and daily family meals. She was reserved regarding her many accomplishments and considered them private. Joan was ahead of her time in many ways. All who knew this elegant and beautiful woman loved and admired her. She made the world a better place and her legacy will live on. She is survived by Martin, her husband and companion of 58 years, her devoted children Aline and Scott Hillman, Madeline and Scott Kerbel four precious grandchildren, Mathew, Amanda, Michelle, and Samantha and many other loving nieces and nephews. Her parents Louis and Esther Friedman and older sister Arline Rosenberg predeceased her. Burial will be private at gravesite. In lieu of Shiva, a memorial will be held at 11am on July 24th at Temple Beth Abraham located at 25 Leroy Avenue in Tarrytown, NY followed a light meal. Donations in her memory can be sent to The Jamie Deutsch Cancer Foundation, 146 Hardscrabble Road, Briarcliff Manor, NY 10510. 1/3"

Brown Jr., 94, a Tuskegee Airman in World War II, an educator, and mentor to a generation of African-American policy makers and civic leaders. Among his many achievements, he was the first U.S. pilot to shoot down a German fighter jet. A remarkable feat considering he did it from the cockpit of a propeller plane. At the time, the accepted view of blacks in the military was that they were not equally capable as their white counterparts. Brown, who received his doctoral degree from NYU, shattered that myth. Despite being subjected to vicious bigotry and racism, he went on to fly 68 combat missions, was heralded as a war hero along with his fellow Tuskegee Airmen and received the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Congressional Gold Medal and numerous other awards. Over his illustrious career in public service Brown worked tirelessly to address educational inequities and expand access to educational opportunities in New York's poor communities. With great sadness we mark his death, and extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends. 1/3"

2016-07-14T00:00:00Z,"BROWN--Roscoe C.,Jr. The Community Service Society (CSS) and its President and CEO David R. Jones mourn the death of Roscoe C. Brown Jr., 94, a Tuskegee Airman in World War II, an educator, and mentor to a generation of African-American policy makers and civic leaders. Among his many achievements, he was the first U.S. pilot to shoot down a German fighter jet. A remarkable feat considering he did it from the cockpit of a propeller plane. At the time, the accepted view of blacks in the military was that they were not equally capable as their white counterparts. Brown, who received his doctoral degree from NYU, shattered that myth. Despite being subjected to vicious bigotry and racism, he went on to fly 68 combat missions, was heralded as a war hero along with his fellow Tuskegee Airmen and received the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Congressional Gold Medal and numerous other awards. Over his illustrious career in public service Brown worked tirelessly to address educational inequities and expand access to educational opportunities in New York's poor communities. With great sadness we mark his death, and extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends. 1/3"

2016-07-17T00:00:00Z,"LOWE--William Webb II, 95, a pioneer in the introduction of nuclear electric power plants in the United States and abroad, died July 4, 2016, at his home in Alexandria, Virginia of cancer. He was a graduate of Purdue University in Chemical Engineering, a Fellow of the American Institute of Chemists, and a member of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the American Chemical Society and the American Nuclear Society. He was also an independent scholar of 17th century English merchant marine history. Lowe was born on December 18, 1920, in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, the son of William Webb Lowe and Grace Evans Lowe. In 1944 he married Mary Jean Sanford of Webster Groves, Missouri. He was preceded in death by his ex-wife, Mary Jean Sanford Lowe; his brothers Lt. Col. Richard Wyche Lowe and Robert Evans Lowe; and one grandchild. He is survived by five children: William Lowe III of Lutz, FL; Judith Lowe of Vienna, VA; Dr. Barbara Lowe-Fierke of Northfield, MN; Dr. Robert Lowe of Lansdale, PA; and Jennifer Lowe Foley of Catlett, VA; fourteen grandchildren; four great grandchildren; his second wife of 42 years, Sylvia Stallings Lowe; and three stepchildren: Dr. Sarah Morris of Los Angeles, CA, Julia Morris Kashkashian of Boulder, CO, and Dr. Michael Morris of Falls Church, VA. In February 1942, two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Lowe volunteered for Army service and was assigned to continue chemical engineering studies at Purdue. In May 1943, he and three others were withdrawn from their units and sent to the University of Pennsylvania for additional engineering courses. In March 1944, with sealed orders, he took seventeen soldiers, all engineers, by train from Philadelphia to Lamy, New Mexico. They were taken by night in an unmarked bus to the now historic 109 East Palace Street atomic bomb project receiving station in Santa Fe, and then to Los Alamos to provide engineering support for scientists. Lowe was chosen by Dr. Arthur Charles Wahl, co-discoverer of plutonium, to help develop methods for producing the extremely pure plutonium thought to be essential for a successful plutonium weapon. Lowe was then 23 years old. Dr. Wahl was 25. Purifying plutonium was considered the second most difficult problem at Los Alamos. Wahl specified the chemistry, Lowe led the team that developed the equipment. By October 1944, they had a process and equipment that worked and Lowe was put in charge of operations. Lowe later wrote: ""I was assigned to supervise receipt and purification of essentially all plutonium made during WWII. In July 1945, I walked down the hall to the metallurgy lab to view with long thoughts the first hemisphere of plutonium, about the size of a baseball, silver coated and resting on a tripod in a dry box."" Dr. Wahl's group was a very small but important part of the enormous enterprise centrally directed and logistically supported by the Manhattan District of the U.S. Corps of Engineers. The project had the highest War Production Board priority. After the war, Lowe received letters of commendation from Major General Groves, leader of the Manhattan Project, and J. Robert Oppenheimer, Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory. He was authorized by the Secretary of War to wear the U.S. Army commendation ribbon. As the Cold War and then Korean War began, Lowe moved to Richland, Washington as Chief of the Nuclear Engineering Section of the Hanford office of the newly created U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. There he initiated a series of critical mass experiments that provided the basis for doubling the plutonium production rate of the original plants. In 1954, he became Chief Nuclear Engineer at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. In 1956, Lowe joined James K. Pickard and Frederick H. Warren as a partner of the engineering firm Pickard, Warren and Lowe and eventually became chairman of it and its successor organizations. In 1960, he and his two partners were cofounders of the Nuclear Utilities Service Corporation. During his career, Lowe worked on behalf of electric power company clients to help select sites, set major design parameters, train people, and conduct safety oversight for a quarter of the 104 nuclear electric power units built in the United States and for several abroad. In the early 1960s, he pioneered the use of quantitative probabilistic risk analysis for choosing nuclear power plant sites and advocated its use for design, construction and operation to identify and reduce the probability of significant accidents. However, when concluding a talk about nuclear power in 1971, he said no new technology had evolved without there being accidents and that ""We must be careful what we do."" After the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident in March 1979, Lowe went to the site at the request of the owners, and was the first to recognize that a massive hydrogen ignition had occurred in the containment, that there was a hydrogen bubble in the primary system, and that the fuel core had been destroyed. He specified procedures for removing the hydrogen bubble in the primary system and other actions to stabilize and analyze the condition of the unit. Aside from his substantial contributions to science and humanity, William Webb Lowe leaves behind a legacy of a generosity of spirit, an unwavering sense of responsibility to those he loved, a firm belief in the importance of honesty, a curiosity about and respect for the forces of nature, a sense of fun and accomplishment in mastering nature, and a fascination in the history of those who have gone before. He now joins his ancestors and though he will be sorely missed, these legacies will live on in those who knew him, and will be passed on to the generations to come. Funeral services will be held on Friday, July 15, 2016 at 2pm at Christ Church, 118 North Washington Street, Alexandria, VA. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Christ Church Foundation Fund: HistoricChristChurch.org. 1/3"

The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of our dear friend and colleague Stewart Pearce, whose Met career spanned 39 years from 1976, when he began at the Metropolitan Opera Guild as an intern, to his retirement in 2015 as Managing Director of the Guild. From 1982 he worked for the Metropolitan Opera Association in various business-related capacities, and was Assistant Manager of the Met from 1997 to 2014. The wide scope of his experience with the company included finance and budgeting, marketing, fundraising, and operations management. Few administrators in the Met's history have had such varied responsibilities, and Stewart's knowledge of the Met and how it worked was second to none. He was tapped by succeeding general managers to tackle some of the company's biggest administrative challenges, and he consistently carried out his tasks with efficiency, tact, precision, and an unflappable calm that earned him everyone's admiration and affection. Stewart loved opera and loved the Met. He played one of the most important roles in the Met's administration, perhaps invisible to the general public, but essential to making our company run smoothly. Stewart's passing came much too soon, and his many friends and colleagues express their deepest condolences to his husband, Kevin, and to all those in and outside of the Opera House who will miss him dearly.

Borough of Manhattan Community College/CUNY and the BMCC Foundation mourn the passing of our friend and longtime supporter Herbert Rosenfield, a founding member of the BMCC Foundation Board of Directors, on which he served for more than 30 years. Mr. Rosenfield, who passed away on Wednesday, July 20, 2016 at the age of 97, was a strong ally to the College. ""Sadly today we've lost a true hero of Downtown Manhattan and a friend that will be missed by many,"" said BMCC President Antonio Perez. ""Herb had a deep concern for those in need and a willingness to help make a difference in their futures."" In the 1960s, the City of New York acquired 24 square blocks along West, Washington and Greenwich Streets. This area has since become, in large part, the Independence Plaza residential project and BMCC, whose 27,000-member student body has become a major force in Lower Manhattan. In addition, Public School 234 took up residence on Chambers and Greenwich Streets, while farther west on Chambers, an additional building for Stuyvesant High School was constructed. Mr. Rosenfield was serving as president of the Chambers Canal Civic Association during the 1980s when the city was looking to sell property in TriBeCa to encourage large-scale developments. The plan was protested by many, including Mr. Rosenfield, who spoke out as an ally in support of small businesses and neighborhood schools, including BMCC. In 1984, Mr. Rosenfield was presented with the BMCC Distinguished Service Award at BMCC's Commencement. The Abner B. Rosenfield Award Fund, which Mr. Rosenfield established to honor the memory of his father, has provided financial support and recognition to numerous BMCC students who exemplify academic excellence and participate in community service.

2016-07-24T00:00:00Z,"POTTER--Priscilla Bowden, died after a brief illness on July 19th in New York City. A fine arts painter, her landscapes of Eastern Long Island where she spent much of her adult life were lauded. In the words of the former art critic for the East Hampton Star, ""Priscilla Bowden had such a knack for capturing the very essence of the East End that to see her paintings, with their misty tones and sense of space and distance, meant that afterwards you went out to the woods and bays and beaches with a renewed appreciation of their beauty. She painted what she saw, but she conveyed so much more."" Born in Glen Cove, Long Island in 1940 she graduated from Radcliffe College going on to the Art Student's League in New York to study painting. New York became her - as a gifted young woman she explored her passions - fashion, romance, far-flung travel. Yet painting was always in the forefront. In 1970 she won the Chaloner Prize awarding her further art studies in Paris but after a few years in France she returned to the landscape she loved most settling into the famed art colony of East Hampton. It was there she met and married the late Jeffrey Potter, the friend and biographer of Jackson Pollock. Together they were at the center of the artistic and literary world's heyday on the South Fork. As her reputation as a painter grew, her work was shown in numerous galleries and museums on Long Island and in New York with shows also in Washington, DC, Florida, Virginia, Connecticut and Oxford, England. Her first gallerist remembers, ""Bowden shared with her contemporary, Jane Wilson, the quality of mystery when dealing with the sky and fog. She was a strong and gifted artist who created works of lasting beauty."" Friends will remember her generous involvement in the East End community -- she played flute in a chamber group, loved the opera, donated her art and her name to charitable fundraisers, and for a while lent her unique talents to making quirky video ""shorts"" for East Hampton's local television. She is survived by two sisters, Linda Laux of Washington, DC and Mary Beth Bowden of New York City, and two nieces, and she enjoyed a close relationship with her husband's four adult children. She will be dearly missed by all who will long remember her gracious and hospitable company, her artistic talent and her wry sense of humor. A memorial service will be held at The Cathedral of St. John the Divine at a later date. 1/3"

A 60-year veteran of the chemical industry, he was the inventor of the yellow Hi-Liter, introduced by Carter's Ink Co. in 1963. He holds over 25 patents. Born in Syracuse, NY and raised in Ohio, he earned a B.S. from John Carroll University, M.S. from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, and Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of Pittsburgh. Beginning his career in wartime research for General Cable Corp., he worked on substitute materials for natural rubber and subsequently developed wire insulation from newly invented synthetic plastics and elastomers. Following the war, he became a Fellow of the Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh where he conducted research for the Quartermaster Corps, the Office of Rubber Reserve and Armstrong Cork Co. His optical cement, designed to overcome the deficiencies of heat-sensitive Canada balsam, was adopted by the military. From the Mellon Institute, Honn joined M.W. Kellogg Co. where he pioneered the development of fluoroelastomers for use at high temperatures in missile and aerospace applications. When the Kellogg division was acquired by the 3M Company, he moved into the role of chemical industry executive, a path he followed with various global chemical companies for the next thirty years. His experience includes serving as vice president of technology for Carter's Ink, vice president of commercial development for the chemical division of Olin Mathieson, vice president of new products for the Mennen Co., and a number of positions with BASF Corporation, ending as director of corporate planning, development and marketing and a member of the executive committee. After retiring from BASF, he served as an outside director of Henkel Corp., the U.S. subsidiary of Henkel KGaA, until 1992. Never content to be anything other than active, in 1988 Honn accepted the Alfred Driscoll Chair and Professor of PharmaceuticalChemical Studies in the Business School at Fairleigh Dickinson University. For 15 years, he taught courses on managing research and technology, strategic management, and international business to MBA candidates employed by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. While there he wrote three textbooks. Honn joined the American Chemical Society in 1944 and remained an active member for his entire career. Another long-term commitment was to the Commercial Development Association, for which he served as president in 1974-75. He was awarded the Golden C for his invention of the Hi-Liter and pioneering work in fluoroelastomers. He was founding chairman of the CDA Educational Foundation. Beyond his professional accomplishments, Honn shared a lifelong love of opera and classical music with his beloved wife of 66 years, Alyce.

He served as trustee and trustee emeritus of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra for thirty years, and was a steadfast and enthusiastic supporter.

Ever intellectually driven, he leaves behind a stack of bedside reading that includes books on the Federal Reserve, materials science, and Harry Truman, as well as carefully catalogued copies of ""Chemical and Engineering News."" Throughout his long and productive life, he remained devoted to his family.
