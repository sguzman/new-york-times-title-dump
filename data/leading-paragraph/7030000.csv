Dr. Ali Abdul Wahed, a surgeon and one of the few staff members to allow his image to be used in the film, said: ''Whoever is on duty, if they don't have to deal with an explosion or a shooting, we say that they're not really living the real Al Yarmouk.''

2008-01-30T09:06:53Z,"For the New York papers, the focus today is on Rudolph W. Giuliani’s precipitous political free fall, after his third-place finish in the Republican presidential primary in Florida on Tuesday night. “Rudy’s Ruin,” says the front of The Post. “The Fat Lady’s Singin’,” declares The Daily News. In The Times, Michael Powell and Michael Cooper dissect what is called a “dizzying free-fall” for the ex-mayor, noting that just a few months ago a senior Giuliani aide had surveyed the Republican field and said: “I don’t believe this can be taken from us. Now that I have that locked up, I can go do battle elsewhere.”Instead, hubris and strategic miscalculations plagued his campaign, political observers say. For one, he allowed a tight coterie of New York aides, none with national political experience, to run much of his campaign. And while he accumulated a fat war chest — he had $16.6 million on hand at the end of September, more than Mitt Romney ($9.5 million) or Senator John McCain ($3.2 million) — he spent vast sums on direct mail instead of building strong organizations on the ground in South Carolina and New Hampshire."

2008-01-30T00:00:00Z,"In a spat between partners who have shared a lot of success, NBC Universal has filed suit against Dick Wolf, the prolific producer of the network’s three “Law & Order” series. The suit, filed last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, centers on complex terms in Mr. Wolf’s contract. NBC argues that Mr. Wolf, right, is misinterpreting them to demand millions of dollars in executive-producer fees for two years after his shows leave the air. NBC’s interpretation is that if the network produces a sufficient number of episodes it can fulfill the contract and not owe Mr. Wolf for work he is no longer doing. Mr. Wolf’s side contends that the contract guarantees the money as a kind of termination payment, or “kill fee.” No matter when NBC decides to end his series, Mr. Wolf argues, he is to be paid for 48 more episodes. NBC asks that if the court finds the contract language ambiguous, it direct that the errors be fixed rather than force NBC to pay the money. A representative of Mr. Wolf, who like other Hollywood writers is on strike, said he was traveling on Tuesday and could not be reached. But Mr. Wolf issued a statement last week saying: “NBC Universal is trying to rewrite an existing contract. Apparently, our partner is willing to commission rewrites during the strike.”."

2008-01-30T00:00:00Z,"It can be a challenge to properly hard-cook an egg. Guess incorrectly on the timing and you might end up with either a soft-cooked egg or a piece of rubber. The guesswork is gone with this new microwave egg boiler. To cook, one needs to fill the bottom with tap water, replace the aluminum rack, add up to four eggs, cover, put the boiler in the microwave and set the timer. A guide suggests times according to oven power. I should have left the eggs in about a minute longer for hard-boiled on my first attempt. But I was guessing about the power on my fairly ancient microwave oven; newer ovens state the power on a sticker. The eggs were very easy to peel; I could even peel a medium-boiled egg to serve on a salad. It's important to leave the egg boiler in the oven for two minutes after the time is up and to use potholders (the outside gets hot)."

2008-01-30T00:00:00Z,"CHRISTOPHERSON--William Martin, M.D. 91, of Louisville, Kentucky, died December 21, 2007. Born in Salt Lake City the son of a mine supervisor, Dr. Christopherson was an undergraduate at the University of Utah, took his M.D. from the University of Louisville in 1942 and his residency in pathology at City Hospital of Akron. He was among a pioneering cadre of young pathologists who sought specialized training in neoplastic diseases under the celebrated Dr. Fred Waldorf Stewart at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (1949-50). Returning to the University of Louisville School of Medicine, Dr. Christopherson rose to Professor and Chairman of the Department of Pathology (1956-1974) and was named Distinguished Professor in 1979. His early investigations included novel research into the tissue biology of interstitial irradiation. He went on to contribute landmark cytologic and epidemiologic studies of precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix as well as experimental cervical carcinogenesis in animal models. His efforts proved invaluable in determining the impact of cytologic screening (the ''Pap test'') on the detection of cervical cancer and ''Dr. Chris,'' as he was affectionately known, came to be justly credited for a significant role in reducing the death rate due to this disease. He provided seminal descriptions of various human cancers, most notably the study, written with Drs. Stewart and Frank Foote, establishing alveolar soft part sarcoma as a distinct entity. The recipient of numerous awards, Dr. Christopherson served as President of The American Society of Cytology, The Arthur Purdy Stout Society of Surgical Pathologists and The International Academy of Pathology. In 1971, he was made Honorary Life Member of the Board of Directors of the American Cancer Society. A dedicated mentor, Dr. Chris continued to teach until his retirement in 2001. Our condolences to his wife of 64 years, Kathryn, and entire family. He is survived, as well, by many admiring colleagues, grateful students and an incalculable number of patients whose lives his labors helped preserve. Marc K.

It is, in a sense, like planning your own funeral, and I'm sure it feels that way, or at least for a while. I can remember sitting with Bill Bradley in his bare campaign office just after his withdrawal speech in 2000. Everyone was already gone except for a few loyal staff members and the last two Secret Service agents guarding the door. All the noise from all the rallies had subsided, and all that remained were a few empty cubicles and the occasional unanswered phone. I will never forget how one of the agents, checking his watch, offered the candidate a ride home before the final shift came to an end. It's not just the candidate, though, who suffers the trauma. For all the people who work on a campaign, who share cramped apartments with other true believers and keep most of their belongings in a car, the end really does feel like The End. I stood in the Ohio headquarters of America Coming Together, the massive Democratic voter turnout operation, as John Kerry and John Edwards gave their concession speech the day after the 2004 election. A smart young organizer was weeping on her boss's shoulder. I knew that if she lived to be 90, no matter what else she did or how successfully, the memory of that moment would probably still feel like a kick in the gut."

In my youth, women were forever collecting the equivalent of iron deer, or auditioning and being discovered and going off to Biloxi or maybe even New York or Busch Gardens. They certainly did - and do - a fair share of ""going off to Natchez,"" of checking in and out of nuthouses, and all such activities were usually reported or repeated at the dinner table. Percy and his brothers believed that their own mother's accident was likely no such thing, that, despite the fact that youngest brother Phin was in the car with her, she drove off the road intentionally.

2008-01-31T00:00:00Z,"PETERSON--Vera Joseph, died peacefully Saturday, January 26, 2008, in Springfield, Massachusetts. She was 98. Born in a small village in St. Ann's Parish, Jamaica, WI, Dr. Joseph, as she was known professionally, came to the United States through Ellis Island in 1919. She attended George Washington High School in New York City and won a scholarship to Barnard. She was one of the first African-American graduates of Barnard College where she earned Phi Beta Kappa as a junior and graduated in 1932. Dr. Joseph earned her medical school degree at the College of Physicians & Surgeons at Columbia University graduating AOA in 1936. She subsequently did an internship at Harlem Hospital. In 1938, she married Dr. Jerome S. Peterson, also a graduate of Columbia University Physicians & Surgeons graduate of 1931. From 1940 to 1942, they lived in Puerto Rico where they managed several tuberculosis clinics. Returning to New York, Dr. Joseph was a physician and assistant to the director at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union Health Center. In 1950 the family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, where Dr. Joseph was an assistant professor of medicine at the American University of Beirut while her husband worked with the United Nations. The family relocated to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1953 when her husband accepted a position with the World Health Organization. In Geneva, Dr. Joseph was active with the Medical Women's International Association and served as its honorary secretary. She was a member of the Governing Board of the International School, and in 1958 became consultant to the European regional Office of WHO for the advisory group on public health and aging. The couple returned to the United States in 1964, settling in Amherst, Massachusetts. Dr. Joseph assumed a position with the Smith College Health Service, where she eventually rose to become Director. In 1974 she and her husband were co-recipients of the Ira Hiscock award for contributions in public health from the New England Public Health Association. She retired in 1975 from Smith College Health Service. Dr. Joseph served as a Trustee of the Jones Library and the Amherst Savings Bank, Board of Overseers of Williston-Northampton School and on the Health Services Advisory Council of the College of Physicians & Surgeons. Her husband died in 1987, and she founded the Vera Joseph/Jerome S. Peterson Fund for Minority Students at the College of Physicians & Surgeons to honor his memory. Dr. Joseph eventually moved from Amherst to Reeds Landing, a retirement community in Springfield. Vera Joseph Peterson is survived by three daughters; Jane Peterson of Seattle, Washington, Danna Peterson of Worcester, Massachusetts, and Carla Rosenbloom of Washington, D.C., four grandchildren; Claire Roberts of Spokane, Washington, Sarah Rosenbloom of New York City, Julia Rosenbloom of Philadelphia, and Philip Peterson of Worcester, and one greatgrandchild, Jacob Roberts of Spokane.

For now, Mr. Balazs is lending it for public view; beginning Tuesday, it can be seen outside the Tate Modern museum in London. One of only three such structures built by Prouvé for French colonial officers in Africa, the aluminum-paneled building, above, was originally installed in Brazzaville, the Congo Republic. Propped on stilts, it was intended for industrial manufacture as well as a tropical climate -- to which Mr. Balazs, who paid $4.97 million for the house, hopes to return it. ''The idea is it will eventually end up as the centerpiece of some sort of environmentally sound resort,'' said Mr. Balazs, who is planning to develop such a property in Central America. The house will be at the Tate Modern (011-44-20-7887-8888 or tate.org.uk) until April 13, in conjunction with a Prouvé exhibition at the Design Museum in London (011-44-870-833-9955 or designmuseum.org)."

The surge is driven in large part by a major overhaul in the city’s campaign finance law, which, starting this month, will cap contributions from people who do business with the city at less than a tenth of what is now permissible. That means many developers, brokers, landlords and contractors will be limited to giving $400 to a mayoral candidate, compared with $4,950 now."

No matter the destination - from Qatar to the Caribbean - there's some attendant glamor shot of a zero-edge pool or a honeymooning couple kicking at shells on the beach at dusk. It's mind numbing. Then the other day a book passed our desk called South Africa, by a new publishing venture called Well Souled. The volume is a hefty and, yes, glossy 312 pages: images of the country's people, landscape, architecture, food, fashion, iconography. The founder and editor Mital Shah, a 31-year-old former executive at Vera Wang, says she came across all her subjects solely through word of mouth. ""I didn't cast a wide net. I just let one person lead to the next. And I tried to meet everyone, but I didn't try to cover everything."" (To document her far-flung network, there's a ""map"" of her contacts at the end of the book.) The result is a seductive but not synthetic portrait of a place; we encounter musicians, athletes, and designers, along with children orphaned by AIDS, ordinary citizens, and pinup girls from the pages of 1950s Drum magazine. ""I wanted this project to be about being well-traveled but always being soulful about how you travel,"" says Shah, who will release books on more countries and who has plans to apply the concept to other media, along with fashion and home design. ""We want to offer luxury and culture at the same time - and always be giving back."" To put its money where its passport is Well Souled will give 20 percent of the sales of South Africa to organizations that help AIDS orphans; the same percentage from a book about India will go toward rural education. ""It's a big number, but we wanted to put that stake in the ground."" We're feeling that. To order a copy, go to www.wellsouled.com."

2008-02-01T00:00:00Z,"DEEP IN THE SHED: A BLUES SUITE When the pianist Marcus Roberts recorded ''Deep in the Shed,'' his second album, at the close of the 1980s, he was best known as a sideman with Wynton Marsalis. In some ways the album seemed a natural outgrowth of the Marsalis credo. It was an earnest and self-conscious meditation on the blues, composed and loosely organized in suite form. Implicit in the music was an assertion that the blues is serious business, better understood as a feeling than as a form. And though he was trafficking in traditions, Mr. Roberts, then in his late 20s, made the argument feel contemporary as well as personal. (He had learned a lot from Mr. Marsalis, who appeared pseudonymously on the album.) These days ''Deep in the Shed,'' originally released on RCA, is out of print and unavailable on iTunes or other online services. And Mr. Roberts, above, is largely associated with a more historical approach to his craft. In the mid-'90s he released ''Portraits in Blue'' (Sony Classical), an interpretive orchestral reading of Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue.'' His efforts over the last decade have followed a similar course; he has probably been heard by more symphony and Pops subscribers than dedicated jazz fans. This isn't true of his old boss, now the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center."

2008-02-01T00:00:00Z,"'DOUBLE FEATURE' When the Tony Award-winning director and choreographer Susan Stroman returned to the New York City Ballet to whip her 2004 work ''Double Feature'' into shape for this season, there were many familiar faces at rehearsals, including those of the lead men Damian Woetzel and Tom Gold, who are reprising their roles in this two-act homage to silent movies. But the shimmering soloist Tiler Peck, still at the School of American Ballet when ''Double Feature'' had its premiere, was familiar from a far different relationship. Ms. Peck, something of a Broadway baby, played Gracie Shinn in ''The Music Man,'' which Ms. Stroman directed and choreographed in 2000. Now she will dance the lead role in the second-act ballet, ''Makin' Whoopee,'' opposite Mr. Gold as a Buster Keaton-type character (right). Alexandra Ansanelli, now a principal at the Royal Ballet, originated the role, but Ms. Peck is perfect for it, Ms. Stroman said. ''She learned the choreography so quickly that she has time to feel the character,'' she said, adding that ''I remember her being quick to learn.'' Ms. Stroman had no idea that Ms. Peck was classically trained during ''The Music Man.'' Seeing her ''now as a ballet star was actually emotional,'' she said. While Ms. Peck's star is rising, Mr. Woetzel, who stars in the first-act ballet, ''The Blue Necklace,'' is retiring this spring. Ms. Stroman, like many others, said she will miss this wonderfully nuanced principal dancer. But she also has plans for him."

2008-02-01T00:00:00Z,"INTRODUCING BERT WILLIAMS Here's to movies and records! Without them the vaudeville comedian Bert Williams would have a secure place in theater history, but he would be present to us only through the rapturous descriptions of critics and contemporaries like W. C. Fields, who called him ''the funniest man I ever saw and the saddest man I ever knew.'' Williams (1874-1922), above, is generally considered America's first black star. He broke vaudeville's color line and recorded hit after hit for Columbia, though he made only a few movies. Two Biograph shorts from 1916 -- ''Fish,'' a dramatization of one of his comic stories, and ''Gambler,'' which ends with one of his famous vaudeville bits (a wonderful pantomimed poker game) -- are basically it. But if you haven't seen them, get yourself to the Museum of Modern Art, which is showing new 35-millimeter prints on Saturday, along with a special treat: unedited footage from a mysterious romantic comedy featuring Williams. (Steven Higgins, the MoMA curator organizing the show, said not much was known about this film, from who made it to whether it was released.)"

2008-02-01T00:00:00Z,"'COLLAGE: THE UNMONUMENTAL PICTURE' ''Unmonumental: The Object in the 21st Century,'' the inaugural exhibition at the new New Museum of Contemporary Art, seems to be widely, and unfairly, unloved. But the addition of its second phase, ''Collage,'' with works by 11 more artists, to the museum's previously bare walls may change a few minds. It certainly warms up the galleries. The works affirm the show's focus on artists who work by hand, usually with salvaged materials, to make explicitly mongrel artworks that don't need electricity. Several of the collages aren't so unmonumental at all: Thomas Hirshhorn's vehement ''Tattoo Series'' climbs the wall, linking violence, pornography and tattooing in a scary mélange of bodies, drawings and ideological symbols. Wangechi Mutu has turned one long wall and part of the floor into an immense desert landscape, with a possibly environmental subtext, overseen by a bulbous, found-object moon. Mark Bradford has contributed a mural-size circulation system (map? skin? ant tunnels?) layered with eroded posters (above, on large wall)."

2008-02-02T00:00:00Z,"The retrial of six construction workers accused of conspiring to join forces with Al Qaeda and blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago began in Miami, seven weeks after the jury in the first trial deadlocked on those defendants and acquitted a seventh. In opening statements, prosecutors and defense lawyers hewed to essentially the same arguments they had made in the first trial, the outcome of which was widely regarded as a significant defeat for the government. Prosecutors insisted that even though the plot did not evolve beyond initial planning stages, the men avidly sought backing from Al Qaeda and demonstrated a determination to carry out their plan. The men, who lived in the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami, were indicted after a nine-month investigation in which a paid informant for the F.B.I. posed as a Qaeda operative sent from the Middle East to help them plan and carry out attacks. Defense lawyers said the whole plot was scripted by F.B.I. agents determined to make a terrorism case at any cost in the charged post-9/11 environment."

APPROVES STENT Medtronic said it had received federal approval to sell its drug-coated stent, the first to enter the United States market since safety concerns sank their popularity two years ago. The Food and Drug Administration said it cleared the company's Endeavor stent for use in patients with clogged arteries. Medtronic said it expected to ship 100,000 units to hospitals in February.

Butts III, the pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and one of New York’s most influential clergymen, endorsed Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton two weeks ago, on the eve of the holiday marking the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday. Speaking to the congregation that day, Mrs. Clinton paraphrased Frederick Douglass, the 19th-century black abolitionist, telling the congregation: “Right has no sex and truth has no color.” But at the church this morning, there was little agreement on who would be the best candidate to carry the Democratic flag into the general election in November."

2008-02-03T19:06:55Z,"Well, Super Tuesday is finally upon us, and it must be comforting to Democrats in their 22 primary states to know that their votes will, you know, count. As you're no doubt aware, Florida and Michigan, also known as ""the bad boys of statedom,"" moved their primaries ahead of Feb. 5 to gain influence and campaign dollars. Tragically, they were punished by the Democratic National Committee by having their delegates denied seats at the party's national convention. (Even more tragically, they lost the chance to sample D.N.C. chairman Howard Dean's homemade ice cream in either of its two flavors, Facial Pink and Grassroot.) But all this could have been avoided if Michigan and Florida hadn't miscalculated the real reason that Super Tuesday carries so much clout: its cool name."

Von Furstenberg loves an historical theme to sell contemporary clothes. Lots of layers here, to a vague 1940s slant. In fact, I kept thinking during the show that if I put that black polo sweater I have over that ruffled cream Blass blouse that's been lurking in the back of my closet for ages, and fish around for a slim skirt, I'd have the look.

But the Giants have three of the best pass rushers in the N.F.L., and they are sure to go after Brady to test his sprained right ankle. The Patriots may have the best offensive line in the game, so inside pressure from Justin Tuck will be critical if the Giants hope to collapse the pocket and force Brady to throw quickly. The problem for the Giants is that Brady is brilliant at reading defenses and quickly finding an open receiver like Wes Welker if the rush is coming. The Patriots could put Brady in the shotgun to give him a bit more time. This will be the most important matchup of the game."
2008-02-03T00:00:00Z,"MALOTT--Mary, Myart also known as Mary McIntyre: 1928-2008. Mary was an Austin, Texas and New York City painter, sculptor, assemblage artist, art critic, and diarist whose artistic bent also led her into unpredicted success in real estate development.

2008-02-03T00:00:00Z,"NECARSULMER--Henry, life long New Yorker, loving husband of Elizabeth Louise and adored father of Susan N. Goldsmith and John B. and Peter B. Necarsulmer, passed away peacefully on January 31, 2008 in his Manhattan home at the age of 93. A man who combined integrity, precision and the highest personal standards with great wit and an extraordinary commitment to family and friends, Henry was respected by all who knew him as a gentleman in the truest sense of the word. His family, and most especially Betty, his life partner for 61 years, celebrate in Henry a life well lived as husband, father, grandfather, family patriarch, respected role model and trusted friend. In 1935, Henry began his distinguished 62 year career on Wall Street as an investment banker with Kuhn, Loeb & Co., where he served as Managing Partner from 1969 to 1977. He was an architect of the creation of Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb, Inc. in 1977, one of the earliest mergers of two major Wall Street investmentbanking institutions. From 1977 until 1990, Henry served as a Managing Director and Advisory Director of Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb, Inc., and as a Consultant to Lehman Brothers, Inc. until 1997, when he retired at the youthful age of 82. During his career, Henry was the principal investment banker for, among others, Westinghouse Electric, Bethlehem Steel, Rockwell, Polaroid, Uniroyal and GATX. He served on many corporate boards, but none gave him more pleasure than his two decades of service to Polaroid where he was also a valued friend of inventor and company founder Dr. Edwin H. Land. Henry graduated from Dartmouth College in 1934, and served to Captain, Finance Department, in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1946. Like his father Edward before him, he served for many years as a Director of the Jewish Child Care Association of New York. Henry was the son of Edward Necarsulmer and Manuela Maas, and brother of Edward Jr. and Robert, previously deceased. In addition to his wife and three children, he is survived by son-in-law John S. Goldsmith, daughters-in-law Helene Calvet and Susan A. Thurman, grandchildren Alison B. Ferrer, Matthew A. Dallin, Amanda M. Necarsulmer and Alexis M. Necarsulmer, and many loving nieces and nephews. Henry's life will be celebrated at a family gathering. The family requests that, in lieu of flowers, friends of Henry consider making a donation either to the Jewish Child Care Association, 120 Wall Street, NY, NY 10005, or to Dartmouth College Alumni Association, 6068 Blunt Alumni Center, Hanover, NH 03755."

Can he find an open receiver against the Giants' weak spot, the secondary, before he is consumed by the Giants' greatest strength, the pass rush? With a relentless front four and a dizzying mix of blitzes, the Giants led the N.F.L. in sacks. But the Patriots often deploy five receivers, which will strain the secondary. When the teams played in December, the Patriots had only 44 rushing yards on 26 rushes but still rolled up 38 points and 27 first downs. Brady completed 76.2 percent of his passes for 356 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Giants, who sacked him only once in 43 pass plays, cannot afford a repeat performance."

The financial relief comes from the redefinition of jumbo loans, a category that currently includes all mortgages greater than $417,000.

Barbara spent the latter part of her life living with her sister in Prairie Village, KS. Barbara's beauty, wit, intelligence, generosity, compassion, friendship and creative abilities were legendary.

''Elegy'' is a fitting excerpt from Thin Mask, a book of her poems (published by Crown, New York in 1939): ''When you are dead. I say. I shall not weep. I say that I shall be as I have been before. I wonder if I shall. I shall remember vividly, I know, The many little things you did, And I shall wonder, Ceaselessly, If you are laughing now, If you at last are glad. Forever.'' Barbara's life is not defined by the list of her accomplishments, but rather by the many lives she touched and influenced. She loved her parents, Karl Middendorf and Ethel Bown Middendorf and her stepmother, Olive. She treasured and loved her friends Jane Blaffer Owen, Frank Kelly and Philip Hughes.

2008-02-03T00:00:00Z,"FERRARI--Frank. Frank Ferrari passed away in early January of prostate cancer. Elsewhere, according to Ted Smyth, the Chief Administrative officer of Heinz World Headquarters, ''He was a courageous giant of diplomacy, who did so much to end the scourge of apartheid and to promote good relations between the United States and Africa.'' Born in 1928 in Jersey City, NJ, Frank Ferrari received a degree in business from New York University and settled in the Town of Mamaroneck in 1960. For 30 years he worked for the African-American Institute retiring as the vice president of the non-profit organization that promotes development in Africa, primarily through education and training. At the time of his death he was the president of Proventures, Inc., an international advisory group, which he had founded in 1995. ''We have lost a dear, a wonderful friend in the passing of Frank Ferrari,'' said Bishop Desmond Tutu. ''I seem to have known him forever. He was deeply committed to struggle against injustice and racism and was a superb ally in our anti-apartheid struggle. As a Vice President of the AfricanAmerican Institute he knew many of Africa's current crop of leaders, having known most of them when they were fighting against their colonial masters. He used to advise me about strategies for our own struggle and would arrange for me to see the UN Secretary General in NY and then set up meetings with Congressional leaders in Washington, D.C. I would have been totally out of my depth without him as my chaperone.'' Mr. Ferrari's international work brought him in contact with those fighting for independence in Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa and also with those fighting for civil rights in the United States. His son said he knew everyone--John Lewis, Julian Bond, Jesse Jackson, David Dinkins, Andrew Young, and Harry Belafonte. ''Everybody went to him, including Senator Ted Kennedy.'' President Thabo Mbeki wrote: ''For many of us, Frank's departure seems to mark the end of a particular epoch in the evolution both of our country and Africa. This is because as Africans, we have had the privilege of working with Frank over many decades.'' Mr. Ferrari is survived by his wife of 53 years, Mary Selby Ferrari; his four children: Paul, Maryann, John and Jim; and five grandchildren.

A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Rutgers University in 1975, Pospisil began his career in energy and environmental journalism in 1981 working for Fairchild Publications.

Until his death, he worked chiefly for McGraw-Hill's stable of energy publications, although throughout his career he worked for other publishers in the United States and the United Kingdom. It was poetry, though, that was his passion. Pospisil's poems, which he often read for audiences in the East Village and elsewhere in Manhattan, were intensely personal, filled with vivid imagery and ranging from the humorous to the harrowing. His work has been published by Lyric, Iambs & Trochees, The Newport Review, Rogue Scholars and others. In 2006, his chapbook of poems, Some Time Before the Bell, was published by Modern Metrics Press. A collection of his work is scheduled to be published in Ireland by Seven Towers Publishing in 2009.

2008-02-04T09:54:02Z,"The New York papers, not surprisingly, provide heavy coverage of the Giants’ improbable 17-14 victory in the Super Bowl, which denied the New England Patriots (and their quarterback with the supermodel girlfriend, Tom Brady) a chance at historic perfection and gave the New York team its first Super Bowl championship since 1991. The New York Post praises them as “Supermen!” while The Daily News blares “Champs” on their front covers. Giants quarterback Eli Manning, arguably played more like Brady than Brady himself, and was awarded the most valuable player award only a year after his older brother, Peyton Manning, won it while leading the Indianapolis Colts to the championship.The newspapers dissect the heart-stopping game (the lead switched three times during the final quarter). The Patriots defense crumbled in the fourth quarter, which proved telling given that the Giants’ aggressive defense shut down what was perhaps the best offense in the history of football. While the Giants were universally deemed the underdog, Plaxico Burress, who caught the game-winning touchdown, exhibited prescience in his pre-game prediction of a low-scoring game with a small margin of victory in favor of the Giants (off by the winning margin, off by the exact score, but close enough that everyone is praising him).

2008-02-04T15:51:51Z,Every championship contender arrives at the chaotic intersection of luck and skill. Whether the result is a crash or an escape often makes the difference between falling short and standing tall.
2008-02-04T15:50:51Z,Brian Stelter writes on the TV Decoder blog:
2008-02-04T15:36:55Z,"More campaign-related opinion for Monday, Feb. 4:"
2008-02-04T15:35:13Z,"Three months into the writers' strike, newsmagazines are still relatively rare on prime time schedules, despite pre-strike predictions that news would fill some of the scripted programming holes. ""Dateline"" is only being shown once this month, and ""48 Hours"" is often being shown on Saturdays, the least lively night of the week on TV."
2008-02-04T15:07:28Z,"I hate to turn every discussion of ""The Moviegoer"" into a discussion about New Orleans. It minimizes Walker Percy to perceive him as purely a Southern writer, or someone who just happened to write the greatest book about the city. But I can't resist pointing out in this final posting just how much of a love poem this book is to New Orleans, which could use one just about right now. ""The streetlights make golden spaces inside the wet leaves of the live oaks,"" he writes, describing a parade night Uptown. ""A south wind carries the smell of coffee from the Tchoupitoulas docks."" Here's Percy on nightfall in Gentilly: ""The sky is a deep bright ocean full of light and life. A mare's tail of cirrus cloud stands in high from the Gulf. High above the Lake a broken vee of ibises points for the marshes; they go suddenly white as they fly into the tilting salient of sunlight."""
2008-02-04T15:05:29Z,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Despite the brutal schedule of the pre-Super Tuesday endgame, Senator Barack Obama seemed crisp and inspired this afternoon throughout his 35-minute address at the Meadowlands here. The audience of more than 3,000 did not fill the 20,000-seat stadium and was smaller than crowds of 12,000 to 20,000 that he has drawn in other states. (Later in the day, in Hartford, where new Connecticut voters were still registering in large numbers, an estimated 17,000 turned out to hear Mr. Obama speak.)"

As always, we invite you to take part in the conversation in the comments section below."
2008-02-04T14:54:00Z,"The tenor of the negotiations in the writer's strike seems to have changed, but Michael Cieply reports that even if the writer's do well in getting a deal, they will likely confront an altered landscape, one in which studios have gotten used to employing workarounds to marginalize the value of original content from writers."
2008-02-04T14:51:02Z,"Next Sunday, the BAFTA's, usually a by-the-way event here in Oscar-land, will go off amid heightened interest, in part because there has been so little hoopla on the home front. Daniel Kenealy at Award's Daily spends some time staring at the English tea leaves and says advises that we look for mischief in the interplay of the top two categories -- best film and best director-- in spite of ""Atonement's"" commanding presence in both of them."

2008-02-04T11:43:03Z,"There's been talk here about what ""The Moviegoer"" generated. But I think it's also worth considering how it represents the end of something. As we've seen, Aunt Emily - standing in for William Alexander Percy - stands for the end of the Southern Way, for a certain noblesse oblige that had already been swept aside by history by the time the book was written, and which Percy can only salute in passing. And Binx himself represents a certain kind of self-conscious Southern protagonist who isn't quite an anti-hero but is self-conscious, well aware of his limitations and foibles - if he doesn't in fact revel in them. He's wounded and he knows it and he loves himself for it - he's a noble Confederate junior officer ill-equipped for life in the squalid Union, and proud of it. He too has been swept away by the tides of progress - and Percy's later fiction, from the perfectly-titled ""The Last Gentleman"" on, bears witness to his noble, doomed trajectory."

During his career, Henry was the principal investment banker for, among others, Westinghouse Electric, Bethlehem Steel, Rockwell, Polaroid, Uniroyal and GATX. He served on many corporate boards, but none gave him more pleasure than his two decades of service to Polaroid where he was also a valued friend of inventor and company founder Dr. Edwin H. Land. Henry graduated from Dartmouth College in 1934, and served to Captain, Finance Department, in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1946.

2008-02-04T00:00:00Z,"The 2008 presidential race has featured an early field of candidates in both parties, and a monumental block of early primaries. Those factors have produced an unprecedented level of fund-raising and spending in the year leading up to the election. President Bush, the only Republican candidate in 2004, was able to spend conservatively through 2003. A competitive field of Democratic candidates was reflected in earlier fund-raising and more aggressive spending through early 2003. Increased receipts may also be partly due to contribution limit increases. In 2004, individuals could give a candidate up to $2,000 in the primary; for 2008, the limit is $2,300."

There's nothing in my review tomorrow about Jil Sander, though I did wonder if the tulle-veiled tweed and embroidered skirts, etc. at Herrera and Oscar started with Raf Simons' transparency collection for spring. I think the only point of comparison between Sander and Halston is that both designers had to clean house a bit with their brands, find the main points. (I hate that dreaded word DNA; I expect to find bodies.) After two or three seasons of establishing a line and his tailoring, as well as the great dresses, Simons has felt free to do more with Jil. I suspect Marco Zanini will do the same thing. The guy is smart, and not affected by the side-show dramas. And look at all the boxy, flaring and embellished jackets we've seen on the runways this week-the oversized grunge plaid at Preen, the A-line shapes at Herrera, the tweed numbers at Oscar. And who does a super-simple, sharp-shouldered, one-button jacket with a slim skirt (on Freja) and makes it look new? Mister Zanini. That was my favorite look in the show. It's all about knowing what to eliminate. I agree with Marco about the 70s context thing, though I looked at it differently in the review. Halson was not about the furnishings; he was about the architecture: line and cut, and color for visual impact and warmth. So what was Liza M. doing in the front row? Why do the new owners feel they have to sell Halston by telling the history? It's such an old approach."

2008-02-05T00:00:00Z,"LEDERBERG--Joshua S. The Rockefeller University community deeply mourns the loss of our beloved friend and colleague Joshua S. Lederberg, fifth President of The Rockefeller University and recipient of the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. His seminal discovery, while a doctoral student, that a form of sexual reproduction occurs in bacteria, demonstrated that bacteria possess a genetic mechanism similar to that of higher organisms, including humans. This work earned him the Nobel Prize at the age of 33 and helped lay the foundation for the current revolution in molecular biology and biotechnology. He was President of The Rockefeller University from 1978 to 1990. During that time, the University recruited many world-class faculty, created the University Fellows Program, which brought outstanding young scientists to campus, and constructed a major new research building. Throughout his career, Dr. Lederberg took on important advisory roles in government. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine. He served as scientific counselor to nine U.S. presidential administrations and many world leaders on issues ranging from cancer and emerging infectious diseases to space exploration and biological weapons disarmament. He was honored with the National Medal of Science and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Dr. Lederberg was a gifted teacher and mentor, and he will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife of 40 years, Dr. Marguerite S. Lederberg, his children, Anne Lederberg and David Kirsch, and his many colleagues on campus. Russell L. Carson, Chairman David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Richard M. Furlaud, Chairman Emeritus Paul Nurse, President Frederick Seitz and Torsten N. Wiesel, Presidents Emeriti LEDERBERG--Joshua. The Ellison Medical Foundation, its Scientific Advisory Board, its staff and its more than 300 present and former Ellison Scholars mourn the loss of Dr. Joshua Lederberg. Dr. Lederberg died Saturday, February 2, 2008 at the age of 82. Dr. Lederberg was instrumental in the creation of The Ellison Medical Foundation. His great foresight and creative approach to scientific progress and his close relationship with Larry Ellison, Founder and CEO of Oracle Corporation led Mr. Ellison to fund scientists in basic research whose approach was innovative, often risky, and under-funded, but which would prove beneficial toward eliminating human disease and disability. In a series of wide ranging conversations Mr. Ellison and Dr. Lederberg discussed different fields of scholarship as a focus for the nascent foundation -''and aging was one that stuck,'' Dr. Lederberg said. ''It was clear it was an area that was not quite integrated into what most molecular biologists were doing.'' The result of these conversations was the creation of The Ellison Medical Foundation, the single largest philanthropic funding source for research on aging. Dr. Lederberg served as Chair of The Ellison Medical Foundation from its inception in 1998. The program has funded promising junior investigators as well as leading senior investigators, a number of whom, such as the late Seymour Benzer, were new to this field of research. Ellison Scholars have produced exciting new findings and have trained outstanding new investigators dedicated to research on basic mechanisms of biological aging. Dr. Lederberg, more than most of his contemporaries, realized that an understanding of these mechanisms had the potential to lead to rational preventive and therapeutic interventions for a very large number of major diseases of aging. He recruited a stellar group of fellow scientists for this effort by exhorting them ''Our job is to fund the new, the unconventional and to take chances that others won't. Our only criterion will be the best science and the best of scientists.'' Dr. Lederberg was President - Emeritus and Sackler Foundation Scholar at The Rockefeller University, New York. His life long research, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1958, was on the genetic structure and function of microorganisms. Among his many honors, he was a member of the National Academy of Science, and was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1989. He long had a keen interest in international health, and was actively engaged in the building of international collaboration and collective defenses against emerging infections of global impact. His numerous awards, in addition to the Nobel Prize, included membership in the National Academy of Sciences, The National Medal of Science, and a Research Award of Distinction from the American Federation for Aging Research. He was particularly pleased to have been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. The text of the formal citation presented at a ceremony held in the White House on December 15, 2006, succinctly summarized his amazing versatility and legacy: ''Dr. Joshua Lederberg has devoted his life to the advancement of human knowledge across a remarkable range of scientific endeavor. His work in bacterial genetics earned him a Nobel Prize and laid the groundwork for future progress in the study of genetics. He has helped develop advanced computer technology, worked with NASA in the search for life on Mars, and served as a distinguished scientific advisor to our Nation's policymakers. The United States honors Joshua Lederberg for his achievements in scientific discovery and his commitment to improving the lives of others.'' (From The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, December 15, 2006) The Ellison Medical Foundation will miss Josh's vision and great humanity. We convey our most sincere condolences to his wife, Dr. Marguerite Lederberg, whom we all love and admire, and his children, Anne Lederberg and David Kirsch. George M. Martin, M.D. Acting Chair, Scientific Advisory Board The Ellison Medical Foundation Richard L. Sprott, Ph.D. Executive Director, The Ellison Medical Foundation"

2008-02-06T00:00:00Z,"Lyrics about drugs, alcohol and tobacco pervade popular music in the United States, according to a study published in the journal Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, Reuters reported. The report of a team led by Dr. Brian Primack of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and released on Monday calculated that Americans from ages 15 to 18 listening to 2.4 hours of music a day hear 84 references to substances daily and more than 30,000 annually. About two-thirds of the references put drugs, alcohol and tobacco in a positive light by associating them with sex, partying and humor, the study said. Some genres, like rap and country in comparison with pop, have more references than others. The team used Billboard charts to identify the most popular songs of 2005, based on sales and airplay. They selected the 279 most popular from country, pop, R&B, rap and rock to examine for references to drugs, alcohol and tobacco. One third had explicit references; 42 percent had some kind of substance abuse reference. Jonathan Lamy, a spokesman for the Recording Industry Association of America, said, “While we have not had the opportunity to thoroughly assess the study, it’s important to note that music is generally a reflection of society.” He noted that albums carry parental advisory logos."

2008-02-06T00:00:00Z,"ROMIGUIERE--Annalee Kiernan Cutrone, ''Lee'', traded the catwalks of Paris for a diner under the viaduct on 125th street. Afterall she was born and raised on the Upper Westside, the eldest of nine, daughter to Bertha and Peter, a NYC fireman. Her glamorous escape to the city-of-light merely set the scene for her homecoming and marriage to a streetwise local boy. A ''creature des reves,'' to debonair Frenchmen, Annalee Cutrone became a familiar face in the neighborhood as both a mother and entrepreneur. When she wasn't volunteering at Columbia Greenhouse Nursery, the April 1962 Playboy covergirl could be found slinging hash at her 125th St. Diner, or up the block pouring a stiff drink at her bar the 712. When a small, below street level location at the corner of Amsterdam and 116th opened up, Annalee's The Restaurant moved in. Across from the Columbia gates, Annalee's was a crossroads where students could afford to dine with the likes of Edward Said and Zbigniew Brzezinski to name a few. Annalee herself was a true neighborhood personality; not the sort broadcast indiscriminately and everywhere, but one who is well known to you if you happened to have been there. Any passerby seeing such a classic beauty stepping out of the AMC Pacer she won in a Fuji Photo contest had in their memory an unforgetable snapshot. We shall always remember Annalee moving blithely among us, an ethereal blonde with a delicate toeto-heel gait, gliding, it seemed, a feather's breath off the ground. Her soothing voice and blue-eyed gaze touched with a loving caress, so tangible were the affections she held in her heart. Indeed, Annalee was the very personification of the gentlest love to the families Agnez, Attardo, Cutrone, Dajani, Drelich, Duff, Kiernan, Romiguiere and Sadlon, and to her dear friends Madeleine, Ingrid, Joyce and Rosemarie. She leaves behind a husband and an ex-husband both devoted to her and remaining steadfastly by her side until her passing in Connecticut where the family used to spend their summers. Her daughterOona and her son Don were also her neighbors, as adoring of her as her grandsons Drew and Shane. Annalee, a woman of pure grace, always seemed a diamond in the rough where the rough, in her mind, could glisten just as brightly as the streetlamps along the Champs-Elysses. And so she passed kissing her husband with a last breath while he sang the same Estonian lullaby her mother used to sing while rocking infant Annalee to sleep. Remember Annalee as you will, and always."

Mary was an Austin, Texas and New York City painter, sculptor, assemblage artist, art critic, and diarist whose artistic bent also led her into unpredicted success in real estate development. She died January 21, 2008, at the age of 79 at the Cobble Hill Nursing Home in Brooklyn, NY after a protracted period of suffering from Alzheimer's. Born Mary Eleanor Harrell in Indiana, she was the daughter of Mary Evans Harrell and Samuel Runnels Harrell who once ran for governor of Indiana.

From 19801981 Mary provided weekly commentary for Artbeat, a show on KLRU-TV in Austin. She also taught art classes at colleges in Austin and for Laguna Gloria Art Museum. Ms. Malott ventured into real estate with her award-winning preservation and development of Austin's Pecan Square. Next, with her daughter Sylvia she rehabilitated the historic Gilfillan House. In the early 1980's, after a divorce from her second husband, Dr. Frances McIntyre, Ms. Malott moved to New York City's SoHo. Ms. Malott's longtime companion in New York was Tim Yohn. ultimately incapacitated by Alzheimer's, Ms. Malott painted her last large painting, a Slices of the Forrest painting, in 1993 at her Marcel Breuer country residence and studio in Clinton Corners, NY.

2008-02-06T00:00:00Z,"MASSACHUSETTS A Generation Gap Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York won in a tight race that was marked by sharp generational divides, with voters ages 45 and older supporting Mrs. Clinton, and younger voters choosing Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, according to exit polls. Many voters had waited until the last minute to make a decision about whom they would support, with about one-third saying they did not decide whom to vote for until the final week of the campaign. Although Mrs. Clinton had held a lead for months, Mr. Obama appeared to get a significant bounce after receiving the backing of the state's senior senator, Edward M. Kennedy. One local poll this week showed Mr. Obama slightly edging ahead of Mrs. Clinton. The state's 93 pledged delegates are allocated proportionally between the two candidates, with 31 based on the statewide results and the remainder divided based on the vote in each of the congressional districts. Each candidate had raised considerable money in the state -- Mr. Obama $1.98 million, and Mrs. Clinton $1.88 million."

Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, matched Senator John McCain in attracting voters who identified themselves as moderate and took the vast majority of those who identified themselves as conservative. Mr. McCain surprised many by making a campaign stop in Boston on Sunday, where he watched the Super Bowl in a hotel lobby. Polls showed the contest tightening, and Mr. McCain told audiences that he believed he had a chance of winning the state's 43 delegates. Mr. Mc- Cain won the primary in 2000, defeating George W. Bush by nearly two to one. But Mr. Romney dismissed the 11th hour visit by Mr. Mc- Cain, saying, ''I've got a lot of friends there.'' Many observers had said that if Mr. Romney lost his home state, it would signal the end of the campaign.

In 1992, it was sold to restaurateurs who turned it into Grange Hall. In 2004, under more new owners, it briefly reverted to Blue Mill Tavern. Now the space will incorporate design elements that reflect its past. The owners, Tony Zazula and Harold Moore, commissioned David Joel, who had painted a mural in 1993 for the owners of Grange Hall (which they removed when they left), to create a new one. In oil and gold leaf, and measuring 4 by 16 feet, it is similar to the previous work, depicting sleepy workers after a harvest. Mr. Zazula also found a 1941 Art Deco bar."

Lederberg, fifth President of The Rockefeller University and recipient of the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. His seminal discovery, while a doctoral student, that a form of sexual reproduction occurs in bacteria, demonstrated that bacteria possess a genetic mechanism similar to that of higher organisms, including humans. This work earned him the Nobel Prize at the age of 33 and helped lay the foundation for the current revolution in molecular biology and biotechnology. He was President of The Rockefeller University from 1978 to 1990. During that time, the University recruited many world-class faculty, created the University Fellows Program, which brought outstanding young scientists to campus, and constructed a major new research building. Throughout his career, Dr. Lederberg took on important advisory roles in government. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine. He served as scientific counselor to nine U.S. presidential administrations and many world leaders on issues ranging from cancer and emerging infectious diseases to space exploration and biological weapons disarmament. He was honored with the National Medal of Science and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Dr. Lederberg was a gifted teacher and mentor, and he will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife of 40 years, Dr. Marguerite S. Lederberg, his children, Anne Lederberg and David Kirsch, and his many colleagues on campus. Russell L.

Our culture does not encourage anyone to accept adversity. On the contrary, we habitually declare war on the things that afflict us, whether it's drugs, terrorism, or cancer. Our media fetishizes the heart-warming stories of those who, against all odds, never lose hope and fight their way to triumph over poverty, addiction, disease. The person who lies back and says, ""This is my lot. So be it,"" is a quitter, a passive, pessimistic, spineless loser who deserves only our contempt.

2008-02-07T18:05:22Z,"The modern nomination system was designed to prevent us from getting to exactly where we are right now; the point of moving up the first few contests every four years, soon followed with a Super Tuesday payoff, was to try to head off the kind of protracted fights to the convention that had doomed the Republicans in 1976 and the Democrats in 1980. And for the last few decades, at least, it worked. But here, once again, come the chaotic winds of democracy to derail the efficient engine of party politics. The Democratic race, in particular, could go all the way to Denver, and it could end ugly-perhaps with super delegates hijacking the convention, or with lawyers arguing about whether Florida and Michigan should be seated.The accepted wisdom about such drawn-out, titanic clashes-and the reason that insiders have worked so hard to preclude them-is that they are ruinous for a party. The failures of sitting presidents like Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter (as well as challengers like Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale) are said to have proven that parties riven by internal disputes in the summer are incapable of reuniting in the fall; a nominee needs time before the convention to soothe feelings, raise money and recast himself for the general election. This year, though, the accepted wisdom is at least half wrong. That is, it probably still holds true for Republicans, but it could be a mistake to assume the same about Democrats."

While the greenhouse basics remain clear (more CO2 = warmer world), the connection between the trend and dramatic events on short time scales -- the kind that catch our attention -- remains murky, at best. None of this means global warming is unimportant to address. All of this, though, does illustrate the challenge facing those trying to jog the public to respond now to limit a long-term risk. There is no single smoking gun. It remains more a Seurat-style pointillist canvas of evidence. And pointillism does not have the potent punch of, say, ""The Scream.""Tornadoes: There was a spate of Instanet attacks on Senator John Kerry yesterday for discussing projections of stronger storms in a warming world in the context of the catastrophic tornado strikes. His comment was nuanced, but by even bringing climate policy into a conversation on severe weather, he was probably destined to get roughed up. The reason? The science remains utterly equivocal on how global warming might boost the longstanding peril from tornadoes in the storm belt."

The building will house a 262-seat theater, a 71-seat screening room, an education center, expanded gallery space and a courtyard.

The suit, now owned by Zlatko Nedanovski and on display in a second-hand store in Eslov, a town in southern Sweden, will go to the highest bidder when the sale finishes on Saturday. Mr. Nedanovski, 32, bought the swimsuit for $778 after the staff at the pool turned it over to a local radio station. Ms. Kidman, an avid swimmer, forgot the suit at a pool she had reserved for her use in the town of Vanersborg in 2002 while in Sweden to film Lars von Trier’s “Dogville.” Mr. Nedanovski said he hoped to raise $1,400 to buy five cows through the Swedish aid organization Erikshjaelpen. “Today,” he said, referring to an early bid, “we have enough for three cows.”."

Mr. Gwaltney, a makeup artist, showed off his austere half-bowl cut backstage at the BCBG Max Azria show last Friday at the start of New York Fashion Week. He shared with the models and the armies of stylists a penchant for barbershop architecture. Many seemed to personally favor precision-cut bangs, squared crowns, spiky flattops and wildly cresting mohawks, that last looking oddly fresh on Carlos Sanchez (above). One visitor to Bryant Park (right) updated his classic Prince Valiant bob by having it streaked the color of flax and shearing the ends into wisps. Brenna Wallace (below left), a fashion designer, dispensed with the rigors of upkeep by shaving one side of her head. She liked the look's asymmetry, she said, ''but really I did it because I was bored.''"

Unlike shows in the recent past, where home furnishings followed fashion, and color palettes were bright and changed radically from season to season, many of the products at last week's show seemed to suggest a desire for staying power. Fewer designers and home furnishings manufacturers were covering their work in explosions of chartreuse and orange or pink and turquoise, colors that would look outdated after a single season. Instead, there was plenty of black and white, and a few shades of gray, though what inspired the sudden sobriety was unclear."

Predeceased by his wife of 60 years, Florence, he is survived by his son, Michael (wife Lisa Gould), daughter Judith Paley (her husband Bill), and grandsons Adam and Matthew Paley. Known for his wicked and irreverent sense of humor, Harry was much beloved by family and friends. Harry was particularly proud of his service in WWII, having served in the U.S. Army's 29th Infantry Division and having landed in the first wave at Omaha beach in the Normandy Invasion of D-Day. Up from the beachhead, he moved across France in combat and was severely wounded in Belgium in November 1944. Later asked why he never went back to visit, he said, ''I walked across France once. Had I received better treatment, I might have gone back.'' Back home after the war, he quietly and diligently worked hard to raise and support his family, just like many vets who preferred to put their horrific war experiences behind them. Upon retirement, he reconnected with his ''Band of Brothers'' whom he loved as family. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that comparable donations be made in his memory to Hospice of Palm Beach County, 5300 East Avenue, West Palm Beach, FL 33407-2387."

After focusing on Ms. Lee, the protest rallies spread to the Upper East Side home of Philippe Dauman, the president and chief executive of Viacom, which owns BET. The Rev. Delman L. Coates, pastor of the Mount Ennon Baptist Church in Clinton, Md., and the protest organizer, said on Thursday that the rallies brought attention and were one weapon in their battle."

While trainers and patrons say that it’s a lot of fun, group training sessions can also feel a bit like being back in the proverbial sandbox. Competitive streaks can turn friendly companions into huffy ones. Those hoping to impress the trainer cut corners to complete assignments first.

Unlike Anne Frank, she did not keep a diary about her experiences as a Jew in hiding. Her life has never been a subject for Broadway. But her story and that of Monique, a Roman Catholic girl who befriended her, is finding a widening audience, thanks to Patricia Polacco and the organization Making Books Sing. Ms. Polacco, a children's author, knows the background well: Monique is her aunt. The girls' entwined histories first appeared in Ms. Polacco's book ''The Butterfly'' (Philomel, 2000), and they have come to the stage through Making Books Sing, which turns literary works for the young into musicals. In the midst of a three-week run across New York City, ''The Butterfly,'' directed by David Schechter, is a Holocaust drama that moves and inspires but does not lead inexorably toward heartbreak: Sevrine survived the war."

2008-02-08T00:00:00Z,"MYERS--Kenneth Holston. ''I Think I Can'' July 11, 1919 to February 1, 2008. Kenneth Holston Myers (Ken), longtime Ithaca, NY resident passed away peacefully on February 1, 2008. Ken is survived by his three children, Jim, Susan and Jon and his six grandchildren, who reside in Boulder, CO; Redmond, WA; and San Rafael, CA. Ken was a devoted husband, father and grandfather and found great joy and nourishment in his marriage and family. Ken's beloved wife, Bee, whom Ken lovingly referred to as his ''soul mate'', passed into eternity, January 13th, 2006. Ken's life reflects his belief that one can do what one puts one's mind to. Ken loved the book intended for young children, ''The Little Engine That Could''. The story's message is: ''I think I can, I think I can''. Ken's life is characterized, in large part, by Ken's indomitable will to succeed and contribute. Ken and his family lived in Illinois, Japan, California, and Massachusetts, before finding their true home in Ithaca, NY in 1973. The Ithaca community became very dear to Ken, Bee and the Myers family. Ken wrote in 1975, ''We have arrived. We are only too glad to spend all four seasons right here in our home overlooking Cayuga Lake''. Ken contributed greatly to the Ithaca community. Such contributions included his service as President of Citizens Savings Bank, President of the Cayuga Lake Intermunicipal Water Commission, Founder and President of Ithaca Memorial Society, President of Ithaca Housing Authority, Board member of Ithaca City School District Board of Education, and member of Ithaca Rotary Club, City Club of Ithaca, and the First Congregational Church of Ithaca. Ken's pursuit of an Engineering degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology was cut short by two years due to the onset of World War II. He enlisted in U.S. Naval Reserve in 1938. His Reserve unit was mobilized in 1940. Ken's primary service in the War was aboard the destroyer, USS Madison, on which he served as the ship's Chief Engineer and Lieutenant Commander, until the War ended in 1945. The USS Madison was awarded five combat stars for her courageous service in European-African-Middle Eastern Campaigns, including courageous service in the invasion of Southern France in August of 1944. After the War, Ken finished his college degree at Harvard in 1947, graduating with a B.A. in American Government. Upon attainment of his undergraduate degree, Ken enrolled in the Harvard Business School from which he received an MBA with distinction in 1949. He thereafter returned to the city of Chicago, where he had spent the majority of his childhood. He elected to return to school and attended Northwestern University, where he was granted a Ph.D. in Business Administration University in 1956. His primary courses of study in the Doctorate program included Economics, Industrial Management and Operations Management. He authored and published several books including his thesis which was titled, ''Design for Digging, the First Seventy-Five years of the Bucyrus-Erie Company''. He also authored numerous scholarly articles and case studies appearing in a number of scholarly Business Journals. Ken became full Professor at Northwestern in the School of Business just three years after completing his Ph.D. In 1959, Ken split time between his professorship at Northwestern University and his post as Program Director for the Japan Productivity Center in Tokyo. The Center was associated with the University of Tokyo. There he developed the first Japanese Executive Program for Presidents and Directors of major Japanese corporations. Ken later served as visiting full professor at University of Southern California School of Business, where he was responsible for the Executive Development Programs. In 1966, Ken took the position of Dean of the School of Business at Southern Illinois University (SIU) at Edwardsville, where he was responsible for the development of graduate and undergraduate programs in Business Administration. While serving at SIU he also was Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. Ken's consulting and government service as Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago from 1968-1970 led to his decision to leave academia and accept a position to become President of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, where he served from 1970 to 1973. Ken and Bee concluded in 1973 that their family may find greater fulfillment in a smaller community. Thus it was fortuitous that Ken was approached by the Board of Citizens Savings Bank located in Ithaca, NY. The Bank was seeking to replace the outgoing President, who was retiring. Ken accepted the position and served until his retirement in 1985. Ken will be remembered by his loved ones for creating a good life for his family. His children will further remember him for his empathy for those who are underserved by their communities, for his progressiveness, his long range thinking, his questioning of and not infrequent dissatisfaction with the status quo, his memory, the precision with which he used language, his expansive knowledge and interest in the social sciences, law, business, medicine, history, philosophy, religion, anthropology and other fields of study. His friends will remember him for his far-ranging intellect and kindness. The community will remember him for his compassionate action directed to those less fortunate. A Memorial Service will be held on Sunday, February 10th, at 2pm at the First Congregational Church in Ithaca, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Hospicare of Tompkins County, or to the First Congregational Church of Ithaca. Please share thoughts, condolences, and memories by emailing to: Kennethmyers1@gmail.com."

2008-02-08T00:00:00Z,"'JULY RAIN'/'WALKING THE STREETS OF MOSCOW' After the first 15 minutes of Marlen Khutsiyev's ''July Rain'' you may be tempted to pack a suitcase and catch a plane to Moscow, 1966. Like Godard and Truffaut's black-and-white Paris, it's where the cool kids seem to be -- talking, arguing, dancing to jazzy records and trying to construct modern lives. Showing in the invaluable ''Envisioning Russia'' series at the Walter Reade Theater, ''July Rain'' has a loose, improvisatory style, influenced by the Nouvelle Vague and punctuated with lyrical passages in which the camera restlessly probes city streets. About a group of young intellectuals, in particular Lena (an expressive Yevgeniya Uralova, above, with a Julie Christie bob) and her boyfriend, Volodya (Aleksandr Belyavsky), the film has more parties and picnics than plot. But like many Russian movies from the 1960s, it tries to paint an honest picture of daily life and real people. You can feel its internal tug of war between optimism and melancholy: the filmmaking may be exciting -- there's always something interesting to look at -- but melancholy wins hands down. (Not surprisingly, it was criticized for being too dark. Mr. Khutsiyev's previous film, the brilliant ''I Am Twenty,'' had to be reshot and edited after Khrushchev attacked it.)"

2008-02-08T00:00:00Z,"DAVID YAZBEK The demands of musical theater -- beeline storytelling and transparent prosody among them -- usually crush indie-rock songwriters into miserable bits of limp pulp. If David Yazbek has been an exception (his scores for ''The Full Monty'' and ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' are superbly cut gems), that's partly because he sees his Broadway work, including his next project, ''Bruce Lee: Journey to the West,'' as an exacting if lucrative day job. ''When you write for the theater, some of it comes from the gut,'' he said recently, ''but often it's someone else's gut.'' Fans of his Frank Loesser dexterity and Jule Styne savvy will find that Mr. Yazbek's night job has a rather different cast. At his American Songbook concert on Saturday night, he shares the stage not only with the longtime backup band he calls His Warmest Regards but also with special guests who exemplify his range: from the world of opera, the adventurous soprano Lauren Flanigan, and from the world of bizarro, the singer-songwriter Nellie McKay. When it comes to inspiration, Mr. Yazbek, above, half Jewish and half Arab, is something of a pantheist, drawing on sources as diverse as Captain Beefheart, the German group Can, early Godard movies and Tin Pan Alley."

2008-02-08T00:00:00Z,"'THE SLUG BEARERS OF KAYROL ISLAND (OR, THE FRIENDS OF DR. RUSHOWER)' The cartoonist Ben Katchor, best known for his urban tales ''The Jew of New York'' and ''Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer,'' once dropped a princess telephone to the floor. In the wreckage he found a small lead weight, a slug, and wondered where it had come from. The thought prompted a short comic strip that he later expanded into a story about ''an ethical question of what happens when you make things in the world,'' he said. He teamed up with the composer and performer Mark Mulcahy, and eventually the tiny slug and the random query that it inspired led to a genre-defying musical that's unconventional in several ways. ''Even operas have recitatives, but this has singing from one end to the other,'' Mr. Katchor said. ''Everything is elevated to song. Nothing is just stated as words.'' The language is unusual too (one character is obsessed with the poetry he finds in instruction manuals), and so is the scenery, all projected, animated images of Mr. Katchor's drawings. In scenes like the one above, the audience essentially watches actors and musicians navigating onstage with -- and seemingly within -- a graphic novel."

They may be works deemed trivial by the lofty day-to-day standards of the art, performances that are dated and thus scorned or condescended to, manifestations of musical personalities that attract a fascination bordering on unseemly obsession. In any case, these are items that get no respect from the critics' high-minded colleagues, their families, even their pets. Or at least not enough respect."

2008-02-09T00:00:00Z,"Almost 5 percent of the flu samples tested in the United States this season were resistant to the antiflu drug Tamiflu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Tamiflu resistance has been previously almost unknown in the United States. It is more common in Japan, where the drug, also known as oseltamivir, is heavily prescribed. The reason for the increase in resistance is “still under investigation,” said Dr. Joseph Bresee, chief of prevention in the agency’s flu division. All strains tested were susceptible to a related drug, Relenza, or zanamivir. After a slow start to the flu season, the illness is now being reported in all 50 states, Dr. Bresee said. Doctors’ visits and deaths attributable to flu are slightly above normal and increasing, but “not atypical” compared with some of the last 25 years, he said."

First, Mr. Huckabee won the Iowa caucuses, sending Mitt Romney into a tailspin that gave Senator McCain the opening he needed to win New Hampshire. Mr. Huckabee then took enough votes from Mr. Romney in South Carolina and Florida to allow Senator McCain to win both states with scant support from conservative Republicans."

Such a moment was mine as I walked up the side of the River Moskva late in the afternoon of my second day in Russia. The Red Capital in winter is a silent place. Like black ghouls on the soundless snow, the Muscovites went their way, hatted in fur, lamb, leather, and velvet, each with a great collar turned up against the wind that sweeps down the river from the east. ... This, at last, was Red Russia; this horde of sable ghosts, the Bolshevists, the cynosure of an agitated world.

An estimated 20 million Americans were spared additional tax burdens by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2007, known less formally as ''the A.M.T. patch,'' signed by President Bush on Dec. 26. The change means that they will escape the alternative minimum tax, though it is still expected to snare more than 4 million other taxpayers. The patch is effective only for the 2007 tax year, however. A major overhaul of America's complex tax system isn't likely at least until a new Congress and a new president have been elected."

Without fanfare, she gave generously of her time, ingenuity and resources to the people and institutions she valued. Mrs. Miller was born November 12, 1921 in New York City. She received a bachelor of arts degree in art from Hunter College and a masters degree in education from the Bank Street College and had a varied career that included editing, comic book writing, bookkeeping, publicity direction, and occupational therapy, but found her true calling in writing. In 1962, she married the late Richard McDermott Miller, the prominent sculptor, and they enjoyed a loving and mutually supportive marriage until his death in 2004. Mrs. Miller's classic The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook, published in 1966, remains in print. Craig Claiborne wrote that it should be treasured by anyone with a serious interest in the Chinese cuisine and named it to his Recommended Cookbook Library. She wrote or collaborated on several other books, including, with her dear friend Freddie Mae Baxter, The Seventh Child in 1999, and was at work on her latest, her own memoir of her friendship with the writer Grace Paley, at the time of her death. Mrs. Miller traveled extensively throughout her life and collected art and crafts from around the world. She was a fixture in her West Village neighborhood and in her beloved Chinatown, which she visited weekly to shop and eat. She was a benefactor to several non-profits, but especially valued the Authors Guild, of which she was a member since 1977. Her friends loved her for her kindness, humor, intelligence and loyalty, and they miss her tremendously. A memorial service will be held at a time and place to be determined.

2008-02-11T18:01:30Z,What we’re looking at on the Web today…
2008-02-11T11:05:42Z,"Updated, 12:37 p.m. | Addressing the United Nations General Assembly this morning, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg reiterated his call for a carbon tax in the United States, suggested that congestion pricing could be a model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in other world cities and announced a plan to reduce the city’s use of tropical hardwoods, calling tropical deforestation an “ecological calamity.” And of course, he managed to throw in a boast about the city’s 311 line."
2008-02-11T09:00:06Z,"Only three weeks after presenting its budget, Gov. Eliot Spitzer’s administration is lowering projections for tax revenue by $384 million, because of increasingly ominous reports of distress on Wall Street and in the nation’s economy, Danny Hakim reports. To keep the budget in balance, the governor is proposing several new spending cuts, including further paring back increases in Medicaid reimbursements and dipping into the state’s environmental protection fund. While the changes represent a fraction of New York’s $124 billion budget, they are a sign of how rapidly shifting economic forecasts are causing havoc with the state’s fiscal planning. It is rare for a governor to second-guess his own budget, especially so soon after releasing it."

On a pair of startling mixtapes -- ''We Got It 4 Cheap,'' Volumes 1 & 2 -- the pair emerged sounding meaner, slicker and smarter than ever. The two members, Pusha-T and Malice, rhymed almost exclusively about selling crack. They were criminal-minded formalists, and it wasn't exactly clear how their obsessions fit together. Did they care only about selling cocaine and making money? Or did they care only about rhyme schemes and wordplay? And was there a connection?"
2008-02-11T00:00:00Z,"THE WHIGS ''Mission Control'' (ATO) Parker Gispert, the Whigs' guitarist and songwriter, never sounds complacent. His songs are ruthlessly concise, geared to what guitar, bass and drums can play onstage. The Whigs' new album, ''Mission Control,'' rarely digresses from its hooks -- tightly chorded guitar parts and tense but tuneful vocals -- as it dips into rock from the 1960s to the 2000s, from garage-rock to post-punk. Mr. Gispert yowls with a torn, raspy edge in rockers, and when he decides to croon more smoothly, in the same register as Neil Young or Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters, there's still an inner agitation. Underneath, Julian Dorio wallops his drums and splashes cymbals all over the place, making the dynamics erupt."

Dr. Ferrell pleaded guilty in October to a misdemeanor count of “mailing an injurious article.” Mr. Kurtz, a member of the faculty of the University at Buffalo, faces trial on federal mail and wire-fraud charges.

Former Professor of Dermatology at his beloved New York University Skin and Cancer Unit where he taught and was a Chief of Service at the Clinic for many years. Dr. Andrew Franks celebrated his hundredth birthday on June 12 with more than 150 family and friends in Pelham, NY, where he lived with his family, and was an active member of the American Legion, Pelham Post 50, and the Senior Citizens Center. Dr. Franks was born 1907 in the coal mining town of Leckrone, PA, the son of Italian immigrants from Pisa, Italy. Despite his humble beginnings as a coal miner's son, he became a legend in Dermatology. He attended West Virginia University in Morgantown for his pre-medical studies, and because of his extraordinary academic excellence was recruited by New York University School of Medicine into an accelerated six year program graduating in 1932. That year he married Lydia Benigno his beloved wife for 70 years, who died in 2002. Throughout his career, he contributed to three textbooks and over 60 peer-reviewed scientific articles. Dr. Franks served as a medical officer in the United States Army as Colonel and was stationed at Lawson General Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, during WWII. While performing his medical service during the day, he completed a law degree at night upon the Army's request at Woodrow Wilson College of Law (now part of Emory University) in order to best represent those wounded and disabled during the war. He was recently awarded the Greatest Generation Medal in acknowledgement of his service for World War II. As one of the first M.D., LLB graduates in the United States, he and his colleague, and friend, Howard Rusk, along with others, founded the American Academy of Occupational Medicine in the United States where he served as Governor and was a medical legal expert in occupational medicine. He was also active in the Dermatologic Society of Greater New York and hosted its 50th anniversary, and published its Proceedings of 50 years. This past April he received a wonderful recognition from the NYU Alumni Association Annual Meeting for his 75 years of service to the Medical School. Dr. Franks was predeceased by his wife Lydia in 2002 and his daughter Norma in 1998. He is survived by his daughter Joy Catapano, his son and daughter-in-law Drs. Andrew G., Jr. and Linda K. Franks, who both practice in his original office at Gramercy Park, the longest operating family Dermatology practice in the United States. He is also survived by his 11 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. In his most recent years as a resident of Pelham, NY, he was active in the community and neighborhood, and loved by all, both young and old. In 2005, he was honored as the Grand Marshall and led the Memorial Day Parade. He will be remembered for his unwavering optimism, integrity, compassion, and boundless sense of humor which inspired not only his family, but all those who came in contact with him. In celebration of his life, viewing will be at Pelham Funeral Home, 64 Lincoln Ave. on Wednesday, February 13th, 2-4pm and 7-9pm, 914-738-1060 and services held at at Parish of Christ the Redeemer at 10am, 1415 Pelhamdale Avenue in Pelham on Thursday morning, February 14th.

The woman, Banita Jacks, 33, is being held on murder charges. The bodies of the girls, ages 5 to 16, were found Jan. 9 when United States marshals served an eviction notice at the family's apartment in southeast Washington. The medical examiner's office has said that there is evidence that the oldest girl had been stabbed and that the other three girls had markings on their necks and other signs of trauma. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty fired six child welfare workers shortly after the girls were found, a move criticized by union officials who say the employees have excessive caseloads and other problems. A school social worker initially raised concerns about the family in April 2007 after she visited the home and thought Ms. Jacks was holding the girls hostage."
2008-02-13T09:08:53Z,"From his perch at the Manhattan Institute, the right-leaning research group, Sol Stern, 72, has reveled as the city’s cantankerous provocateur against liberal education policies, criticizing reading curriculums that de-emphasize phonics as well as public schools that focus on social justice, Jennifer Medina writes. Like many of his intellectual allies, he had ardently supported school vouchers as a way to give poor and minority children better educational choices and to create competition that would help improve public schools. Although colleagues long thought they had him pegged, he made an abrupt about-face on vouchers in the most recent issue of City Journal, the institute’s magazine, saying there was little evidence they had done much to improve public education across the country. In the circles Mr. Stern inhabits, such a sentiment is a kind of heresy, and his essay has set off a firestorm. But he is relishing the attention."

One of the ordinance’s biggest supporters was the retired game show host Bob Barker, above, who for 25 years concluded the “Price Is Right” by urging viewers to spay or neuter their pets. He has put about $35 million of his own money toward programs that subsidize those operations. Mr. Barker, who will be named by Mr. Alarcon to an outreach committee, said the statute would not be a burden on poor residents because the city offered about 11,000 vouchers for free operations a year and 20,000 for discounts.

A grand jury in Sandusky indicted Mr. Riems, 49, on Monday on charges of rape, sexual battery and patient abuse. Mr. Riems told investigators after his arrest last month that he had abused almost 100 patients since the 1980s, but that he could remember specific information on only about two dozen, the police said.

The Game, 28, above, whose real name is Jayceon Terrell Taylor, was accused of pulling a gun on an opposing player during a pickup basketball game at a south Los Angeles school nearly a year ago. ... A three-judge court in Los Angeles has denied an appeal by the R&B singer Ronald Isley of his 37-month federal sentence for tax evasion. Mr. Isley, 66, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and one of the Isley Brothers, whose hits included “Twist and Shout,” argued that his sentence was unreasonable because of his age and poor health. The appellate court said the trial judge correctly “balanced the need to sanction Mr. Isley’s ‘pathological’ tax evasion against the need to accommodate Mr. Isley’s poor health.” Mr. Isley is in the Federal Correctional Institution in Terre Haute, Ind.

2008-02-13T00:00:00Z,"The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted on Tuesday to give landmark designation to Congregation Tifereth Israel (1911), believed to be the oldest structure in Queens built as a synagogue. Estée Lauder attended services there as a young woman, and in 1979 and 1980 Madonna lived nearby in a building that used to be a yeshiva affiliated with the congregation. The two-story, wood-frame synagogue, right, designed by Crescent L. Varrone, at 109-18 54th Avenue in Corona, combines Gothic and Moorish design elements with Judaic ornaments: pointed-arched windows, a roundel with a Star of David in colored glass, and a gabled parapet. The original wooden stoop and railing have been replaced with a brick porch with an iron railing, and the wood clapboard siding has been covered with stucco. The design was modeled after synagogues on the Lower East Side, where the founders of the congregation, established in 1907, had originally lived. In 2002 the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also on Tuesday, the commission voted for a third time to designate the Jamaica Savings Bank building, an 1898 Hough & Duell Beaux-Arts structure at 161-02 Jamaica Avenue, in Jamaica, as a landmark. Twice previously, the commission’s landmark designation for that building has been overturned: by the Board of Estimate in 1975, and by the City Council in 1992. The building’s owner has agreed to support the current designation, which is expected to meet with Council approval."

Then would come the payoff: the next shot that seemed to arise organically, naturally; and the path from one shot to the next was illuminated by that gentle, soothing voice, caressing the transition: ''...and disoollvve...''; and sometimes we would all join in, six or eight people in the TV truck, all crooning along with our Maestro: ''...and disoollvve...'' To us he was our touchstone, our benchmark. He was the way we measured ourselves. Everything we do from now on will bear his imprint. He showed us the way for more than 30 years, and now we have to mark a path without him, but the path ahead would not exist without the path behind. We were his ''darlings'', and the touch of his hand on our shoulders told us of his faith in us. With his gentle voice he moved us to the creation of beauty. The sounds and sights of the great performers of the age were somehow magnified by his craft and dedication. Now his next great transition is ready, and we hear him as we call the next shot: ''...and disoollvve... Great job, Kirk. Rest well.''

Former Professor of Dermatology at his beloved New York University Skin and Cancer Unit where he taught and was a Chief of Service at the Clinic for many years. Dr. Andrew Franks celebrated his hundredth birthday on June 12 with more than 150 family and friends in Pelham, NY, where he lived with his family, and was an active member of the American Legion, Pelham Post 50, and the Senior Citizens Center. Dr. Franks was born 1907 in the coal mining town of Leckrone, PA, the son of Italian immigrants from Pisa, Italy. Despite his humble beginnings as a coal miner's son, he became a legend in Dermatology. He attended West Virginia University in Morgantown for his pre-medical studies, and because of his extraordinary academic excellence was recruited by New York University School of Medicine into an accelerated six year program graduating in 1932. That year he married Lydia Benigno his beloved wife for 70 years, who died in 2002. Throughout his career, he contributed to three textbooks and over 60 peer-reviewed scientific articles. Dr. Franks served as a medical officer in the United States Army as Colonel and was stationed at Lawson General Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, during WWII. While performing his medical service during the day, he completed a law degree at night upon the Army's request at Woodrow Wilson College of Law (now part of Emory University) in order to best represent those wounded and disabled during the war. He was recently awarded the Greatest Generation Medal in acknowledgement of his service for World War II. As one of the first M.D., LLB graduates in the United States, he and his colleague, and friend, Howard Rusk, along with others, founded the American Academy of Occupational Medicine in the United States where he served as Governor and was a medical legal expert in occupational medicine. He was also active in the Dermatologic Society of Greater New York and hosted its 50th anniversary, and published its Proceedings of 50 years. This past April he received a wonderful recognition from the NYU Alumni Association Annual Meeting for his 75 years of service to the Medical School. Dr. Franks was predeceased by his wife Lydia in 2002 and his daughter Norma in 1998. He is survived by his daughter Joy Catapano, his son and daughter-in-law Drs. Andrew G., Jr. and Linda K. Franks, who both practice in his original office at Gramercy Park, the longest operating family Dermatology practice in the United States. He is also survived by his 11 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. In his most recent years as a resident of Pelham, NY, he was active in the community and neighborhood, and loved by all, both young and old. In 2005, he was honored as the Grand Marshall and led the Memorial Day Parade. He will be remembered for his unwavering optimism, integrity, compassion, and boundless sense of humor which inspired not only his family, but all those who came in contact with him. In celebration of his life, viewing will be at Pelham Funeral Home, 64 Lincoln Ave. on Wednesday, February 13th, 2-4pm and 7-9pm, 914-738-1060 and services held at at Parish of Christ the Redeemer at 10am, 1415 Pelhamdale Avenue in Pelham on Thursday morning, February 14th.

She was much beloved by all members of the Kinsolving family. Born in Luxembourg in 1936, she came to this country in 1941 aboard the troop ship USS Exeter, sailing from Lisbon. Returning to Europe after World War II she attended the American School in Paris and then studied art in a Parisian atelier for three years. She later taught art at the Dalton School in Manhattan. Living in New York and East Hampton, she earned her B.S. in Political Science from Columbia University's School of General Studies and was a tireless fundraiser for the school. She served on the board of her apartment building and on the board of the Art Barge in East Hampton. Her many friends will remember her shining smile, her impish smirk, her generosity of spirit, her diplomacy, her steadfast support of those in need, her sense of humor, her boundless energy and optimism and her cosmopolitan sophistication.

2008-02-14T00:00:00Z,"The United States has won a preliminary ruling in a World Trade Organization case over Chinese tax policies that restrict imports of auto parts, a United States trade official said. The final report in the case is expected to be made public this year. The United States and the European Union filed the case in March 2006 and were later joined by Canada. They complained that China’s tax treatment of auto imports discouraged Chinese automobile manufacturers from using them. China’s commitments to the trade organization require it to set a lower tariff on imported auto parts than it does on finished vehicles, but it had been charging the same tariffs, the United States trade representative’s office said at the time it filed the case. Once a final report is issued, China can appeal the decision."

I’ve had that violin for eight years. It was like losing a friend.” Repairs will take eight months and cost close to $120,000, and the violin may never sound the same. Mr. Garrett is scheduled to perform a Bruch violin concerto on Thursday night at the Barbican on a borrowed Stradivarius. A three-member security team will be helping him watch his step."
2008-02-14T00:00:00Z,"China has blocked production of “Shanghai,” a Hollywood film about an American who investigates a friend’s death in Japanese-occupied Shanghai, The Associated Press reported. Luan Guozhi, the director of international cooperation at the Chinese Film Bureau, declined to reveal the government’s concerns, but said the filmmakers could alter the script and resubmit their application. The Japanese invasion of China during World War II remains a sensitive topic, and other filmmakers have had difficulty winning approval from China for projects set in the same era. Variety has reported that the cast includes John Cusack, Gong Li, right, and Ken Watanabe. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have already been spent on production, and the director, Mikael Hafstrom, has been in China since September preparing to film. Variety reported that he planned to move the production to Hong Kong."

Without fanfare, she gave generously of her time, ingenuity and resources to the people and institutions she valued. Mrs. Miller was born November 12, 1921 in New York City. She received a bachelor of arts degree in art from Hunter College and a masters degree in education from the Bank Street College and had a varied career that included editing, comic book writing, bookkeeping, publicity direction, and occupational therapy, but found her true calling in writing. In 1962, she married the late Richard McDermott Miller, the prominent sculptor, and they enjoyed a loving and mutually supportive marriage until his death in 2004. Mrs. Miller's classic The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook, published in 1966, remains in print. Craig Claiborne wrote that it should be treasured by anyone with a serious interest in the Chinese cuisine and named it to his Recommended Cookbook Library. She wrote or collaborated on several other books, including, with her dear friend Freddie Mae Baxter, The Seventh Child in 1999, and was at work on her latest, her own memoir of her friendship with the writer Grace Paley, at the time of her death. Mrs. Miller traveled extensively throughout her life and collected art and crafts from around the world. She was a fixture in her West Village neighborhood and in her beloved Chinatown, which she visited weekly to shop and eat. She was a benefactor to several non-profits, but especially valued the Authors Guild, of which she was a member since 1977. Her friends loved her for her kindness, humor, intelligence and loyalty, and they miss her tremendously. A memorial service will be held at the Century Association, 7 West 43rd St., NYC on March 19th at 5pm. In lieu of flowers a donation can be made to the Authors Guild Foundation (31 East 32nd Street, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10016)."

2008-02-15T08:54:55Z,"E-mail messages and phone records led detectives to a Pennsylvania man who was questioned for eight hours and then released as part of the investigation of the killing of an Upper East Side psychologist, Kathryn Faughey. The man, William Kunsman, had met Dr. Faughey and her husband at a guitar camp six years ago and had recent contact with her via e-mail, according to Al Baker. While newspapers observed that Mr. Kunsman had little resemblance to the man in the videotape (Mr. Kunsman appeared to have a full head of hair, while the killer had a bald spot), he had been identified in a picture lineup by Dr. Faughey’s colleague, Kent D. Shinbach, a psychiatrist who was in the office during the murder and was critically injured. A patient who was in the office and tried to stop the assailant as he was leaving did not identify Mr. Kunsman."

2008-02-15T12:10:38Z,"Updated, 1:38 p.m. | The morning after the shootings at Northern Illinois University, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg rattled off a grim list of gun rampages across the country that have left at least 18 people dead in February alone, not counting the gunmen who in some cases killed themselves or were killed by police. Mr. Bloomberg’s comments on his weekly radio call-in were part of his crusade to get illegal guns off the streets.“This month John, so far, has just been wretched,” the mayor told John Gambling, his host on WABC-AM (770). He said he had asked his press secretary, Stu Loeser “to get me a list of things that occurred just this month alone. Yesterday, Northern Illinois University, six people, another one died this morning, six people killed. Last Friday in Baton Rouge, a college student shot and killed two people then took his own life. Last Thursday, a gunman shot and killed five people in Kirkwood, Mo., in the City Hall, killed two City Council members and two police officers, and the mayor was very seriously wounded, and he’s hanging in there. And Feb. 2, just a week ago, in the Lane Bryant store in Illinois, a gunmen shot and killed five customers and employees, all in their 20s and 30s.” (The Lede blog has a list of recent campus rampages.)"

If I were to engage in some speculative biography, I'd say that the five young men who make up the Whitest Kids U'Know, a comedy troupe with a new sketch show bearing its name (Sundays on IFC), grew up on Mr. Sandler's dopey, brilliant cultural-pride lyrics and thought: ''Law school?

It may be the way Mr. Duenyas, above, hops about and gurgles with glee after a conquest. Or maybe it's his mildly crazed eyes, or the pale, flat expanse of his stomach, which seems to be entirely muscle free. Whatever the reason, he's irresistible, as is the play. It is possible that you, an ardent New York theatergoer, are not aware that this great country possesses a national theater company, just as it is within the realm of possibility that you have yet to visit the Chocolate Factory, in Long Island City, Queens, where ''Don Juan'' is running.

2008-02-15T00:00:00Z,"MODELL--William D. It is with profound sorrow that we mourn the passing of our beloved Chairman of the Board. Bill Modell was more than a brilliant businessman; he was an enlightened leader who not only created the largest, privately owned sporting goods chain in America, but created a business environment that respected and cared for all its associates. Bill's word was his bond and his integrity was legend. He encouraged the best in each of us and mentored the careers of many. By example, he taught us to care for our city, our country and our fellow citizens. With unquenchable optimism and humor, he worked tirelessly to heal the suffering of others through philanthropic work. He was deeply committed to Gilda's Club New York and Worldwide, which he helped to found, and raised millions of dollars for research, especially for the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America. When our co-president and his son, Michael, died, he took up the reins and led us with unassuming courage. Throughout his own painful battle with cancer, he continued to work for Modell's and for the many research foundations that he co-founded. With kindness, dedication and goodwill, Bill made our world a better place in which to live. Our friend and colleague has been taken from us, but the inspiring legacy of his life will remain with us forever. The Officers and Associates of Modell's Sporting Goods MODELL--William D. The love of my life is gone. We began our journey together with laughter. Now it has ended in tears. My precious, beloved husband devoted his life to me, our children and grandchildren, and his sister and brother-in-law and gave us the most precious gift of all, his love. He became a legend in his own time, building Modell's Sporting Goods into the largest, privately owned sporting goods chain in the country. His brilliant business acumen earned him many honors and awards. Yet, his greatest pleasure was seeing all those he mentored succeed in their careers. During World War II, he proudly served in the Army's Ninth Air Corps and continued to serve his country and New York City throughout his life, as a member of the negotiating committee for the Panama Canal Treaty under President Jimmy Carter, as New York City's Commissioner of Public Affairs for Mayor Abe Beame, and as a founding patron of the Metropolitan Opera House and Lincoln Center for Performing Arts. Though he met world leaders, celebrities and many of America's greatest athletes, he was at heart a down-toearth man, who cared deeply about his family, friends, and . Associates. A humble and gentle man, he helped countless individuals in their time of need. He was the founder of American Digestive Disease Society, a co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation for Immunological Research and the Hewlett House for breast cancer survivors, and was especially dedicated to Gilda's Club of New York and Worldwide which he helped found. No cause meant more to Bill than finding a cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In 1967, when our son Michael was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, he co-founded the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America and raised many millions of dollars for research. Bill never realized his dream to find a cure, and we lost our darling Michael to complications caused by Crohn's disease six years ago. Yet, despite his unspeakable sorrow, Bill never gave up hope. He continued to raise millions to save others from the suffering that our son endured. For me, his children and grandchildren, his friends, and all those who knew him, Bill was a man who filled the world with his vibrant presence, his compassion and love, his sense of humor, his wisdom and integrity, his quiet courage, and his abundant goodwill. The services will be held on Sunday, February 17, 2008, 11am, Temple Emanu-El, 5th Ave at 65th St., New York. I have lost my best friend and partner in life and I am shattered with sorrow.

You lose the intimacy of the close-ups with the cheery characters, and the noise -- including the loud bangs of containers of confetti bursting over the audience's heads -- may make you long for a remote control. But enough Oscar-like grouchiness. None of this seems to bother the energetic toddlers who throng Madison Square Garden every year for the 90-minute live extravaganza. The latest, ''Ready for Action!,'' begins with a topic dear to small children: superheroes. Grover, whose self-description as Super Grover is treated tongue-in-cheek on TV, has lost his ''superness''; when he tries to fly, he collapses in a heap (hilarious if you're under 6). Some of his fellow Muppets -- Telly, Zoe (and her pet rock), Elmo and Rosita -- step in as the Fabulous Five (above, flanking Grover), accepting assignments from the Big Cheese (a talking cheese wedge, of course) until Grover recovers."

2008-02-15T00:00:00Z,"'NINA IN POSITION' Maybe as fallout from last summer's liberatingly eccentric Documenta 12, we've seen a handful of intriguing and enigmatic group shows in New York this season, spun around opaque themes and designed to generate psychic atmosphere. The persuasive ''Nina in Position'' at Artists Space, organized by Jeffrey Uslip, is the latest. The title, characteristically oblique, is a line in the film ''Point of No Return,'' the American remake of ''La Femme Nikita,'' Luc Besson's cult film about assassination, government surveillance and shape-shifting identities, set in a world -- much like our own, Mr. Uslip suggests -- where amorality rules, and nothing is quite what it seems. Pretty little stainless-steel tabletop sculptures by Marco Rios are cast from beefsteaks. A vivid abstract floor piece, below, by Anya Gallaccio isn't all that abstract: it is made of animal blood poured over salt. A Barkley Hendricks photograph of a Ku Klux Klan gathering was shot, not in the deep South, but in the artist's home state, Connecticut."

Beloved wife and best friend for 65 years to Henry Addis, whom she met at a Valentine's Day dance in wartime, married three months later, and remained ''welded to'' for the rest of her life. She was a devoted mother to Joan Gordon, Paul Addis, and Deborah Madison and a cherished grandmother to Gina Gordon, Victoria, Michael, Claire, and Robert Addis, and Kimberly, Charles, and Emily Madison. One of five sisters, she was predeceased by Eleanor Gordon and Selma Waldman and is survived by Marion Rose and Shirley Chesney.

She graduated in 1943 from Mount Sinai School of Nursing in Philadelphia, PA. For many years she worked as an intensive care and emergency room nurse at Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow, NY, carefully scheduling her hours around her family, for, most important, she dedicated her life to her husband, children, and grandchildren. She instilled in her family a life-long passion for reading, words, and the importance of living a moral and full life. She touched everyone she met with her goodness, warmth, wit, and intelligence. An avid crossword puzzler, she only used ink to complete the weekly New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle. Bernice Addis was an inspiration to her adoring family, and she will live on in our hearts.

She is survived by her husband Walter, whom she loved and cared for over the twenty-five years of their marriage. She also leaves a tightknit family of six siblings: Kevin, Owen, Mary, Eileen, Michael, Bernadette, their spouses, seven nieces and nephews, and a grand-niece. Kathryn grew up in Sunnyside, Queens and moved to Manhattan where she established her Clinical Psychology practice, after obtaining her doctorate in Psychology from Yeshiva University. Kathryn's choice of career in a helping profession benefitted her patients, to whom she had an unfailing dedication. She was a spiritual person with a wide variety of interests, including music, writing, and art. Her love of the excitement of Manhattan was matched by her love of the beauty of Paris, which she visited often. Anyone who knew Kathryn was truly blessed.

2008-02-15T00:00:00Z,"RYAN BLOTNICK Ryan Blotnick, a guitarist in his mid-20s, plays with a warm tone, a relaxed cadence and a smart but unassuming air. Born and reared in Maine, he made his run at New York only after graduate studies at a conservatory in Copenhagen. (He was the first American to complete the program.) More recently, from a home base in Brooklyn, he has made inroads within the increasingly amorphous zone that now represents the modern jazz mainstream, earning respectful endorsements from John Abercrombie and Ben Monder, guitarists whose thoughtful styles he has effectively absorbed. On his engagingly pensive debut, ''Music Needs You'' (Songlines), Mr. Blotnick, above, presents a handful of original compositions for contemporary jazz quintet. He seems to write his music as a means of exploring images or ideas -- in the album notes he describes the opening track, ''Winter Melt,'' as ''a portrait of a sunny February morning through a coffee shop window'' -- but the results don't feel plotted or excessively conceptual. There's a sense of something natural unfolding as he and his band mates, notably the alto saxophonist Pete Robbins, elaborate on his themes. That same feeling is likely to prevail next week, when he celebrates the album's release in the company of Mr. Robbins, the pianist Jacob Sacks, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer R. J. Miller."

For more than 30 years, Dr. Sassa was a vital member of our community, and he held a number of key positions at The Rockefeller University Hospital.

We send our sincerest condolences to his life's partner Shelby; to our dearest friend and business associate, his son Mitchell who carries forward his father's legacy in commerce and kindness, in business and philanthropy, with dignity and grace; his sister Doris; his daughter Leslie and to all the members of the Modell Family who we know will feel an emptiness and a void that has been created by the passing of a very special human being who graced this Earth and all of us with his presence. Bill, we too will miss you greatly. Sol and Esther Werdiger & the entire Outerstuff Family MODELL--William D. A giant of a man and a legend in his own time has left this earth for greener pastures. Our beloved friend ''Billy'' will be remembered always as a maven in the retail business. He represented the best values as a husband, father and grandfather. He was loved and admired by those who worked for him. He was loved and admired by those who did business with him. He was loved and admired by those who knew him. He had a big heart, always willing to help others. Along with his wife, Shelby, they created charitable organizations to help those with disease and those less fortunate. He had a wonderful, dry sense of humor and knew how to put a smile on your face. Our entire family will mourn the loss of this dear, wonderful, loving giant of a man. Our condolences are extended to Shelby, Leslie, Mitchell, Doris, and Bill's entire family. Evelyn and Benjamin Kerr, Carol and John Harrison, and Susie and Michael Kerr MODELL--William D. The love of my life is gone. We began our journey together with laughter. Now it has ended in tears. My precious, beloved husband devoted his life to me, our children and grandchildren, and his sister and brother-in-law and gave us the most precious gift of all, his love. He became a legend in his own time, building Modell's Sporting Goods into the largest, privately owned sporting goods chain in the country. His brilliant business acumen earned him many honors and awards. Yet, his greatest pleasure was seeing all those he mentored succeed in their careers. During World War II, he proudly served in the Army's Ninth Air Corps and continued to serve his country and New York City throughout his life, as a member of the negotiating committee for the Panama Canal Treaty under President Jimmy Carter, as New York City's Commissioner of Public Affairs for Mayor Abe Beame, and as a founding patron of the Metropolitan Opera House and Lincoln Center for Performing Arts. Though he met world leaders, celebrities and many of America's greatest athletes, he was at heart a down-toearth man, who cared deeply about his family, friends, and . Associates. A humble and gentle man, he helped countless individuals in their time of need. He was the founder of American Digestive Disease Society, a co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation for Immunological Research and the Hewlett House for breast cancer survivors, and was especially dedicated to Gilda's Club of New York and Worldwide which he helped found. No cause meant more to Bill than finding a cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In 1967, when our son Michael was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, he co-founded the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America and raised many millions of dollars for research. Bill never realized his dream to find a cure, and we lost our darling Michael to complications caused by Crohn's disease six years ago. Yet, despite his unspeakable sorrow, Bill never gave up hope. He continued to raise millions to save others from the suffering that our son endured. For me, his children and grandchildren, his friends, and all those who knew him, Bill was a man who filled the world with his vibrant presence, his compassion and love, his sense of humor, his wisdom and integrity, his quiet courage, and his abundant goodwill. The services will be held on Sunday, February 17, 2008, 11am, Temple Emanu-El, 5th Ave at 65th St., New York. I have lost my best friend and partner in life and I am shattered with sorrow. Billy, you were and always will be my soul mate. I will love you and miss you forever. Your Shelby MODELL--William.

The unraveling of the case against Mr. Brooks began after a DNA test showed that the man convicted in the 1992 case, Kennedy Brewer, was not responsible for the rape. A later test showed that the DNA from the rapist matched that of Mr. Johnson. There is no DNA evidence in the Brooks case.

You're practicing identity politics when you vote for or against someone because of his or her skin color, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or any other marker that leads you to say yes or no independently of a candidate's ideas or policies.

2008-02-17T00:00:00Z,"SPRUCE--Barbara Blue Spruce, ''New Mexico Farm Girl'', dies at 74. Barbara Blue Spruce, a native of Santa Fe, NM and a longtime resident of Staten Island, NY, died recently on Staten Island at the age of 74. Barbara died in the early morning on February 13, after being afflicted with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease). Barbara, the daughter of Carmel Lujan and Amalia Gomez, was born in Jaconita, NM. After her father died when she was very young, she was also raised by her stepfather, Paul Martinez. Some of her fondest memories were of her life as a ''farm girl'' on her family's farm near El Rancho. Her well-known love of roosters could be traced to the rooster pattern on a favorite childhood dress that was given to her by her uncle. Shortly after graduating from Loretto Academy, Barbara married George Blue Spruce Jr. at the Santa Fe Cathedral and they moved to Omaha, NE where George was attending dental school at Creighton University. After his graduation from Creighton, they lived in Santa Fe, NM, Vallejo, CA and Harlem, MT, before settling on Staten Island in 1960. They were divorced in 1968. Once in New York, Barbara took advantage of all of New York's cultural offerings and shared these with her three children. Barbara began working at the U.S. Public Health Hospital (later Bayley Seton Hospital) in the mid-1960's. She worked as a receptionist, administrative assistant and director of volunteers. With her lively personality and wide range of interests, she was beloved by all the people who came in contact with her at the hospital. She retired in 1999 at age 65. Outside of work, Barbara's many interests included opera and classical music, ballet and modern dance, art, architecture, gardening, sewing, knitting, baking, reading books and newspapers, cutting out articles for family and friends, watching tennis, figure skating, basketball and almost anything on PBS. Barbara loved, and is survived by, her two daughters, Sharon Blue Spruce and Reni Siefer, her son, Duane Blue Spruce, her sister, Gloria Holladay, her brother, Leo Martinez, four grandchildren, Shaylyn and Alli Siefer and Miles and Milena Blue Spruce as well as nieces and nephews.

2008-02-17T00:00:00Z,"MIGRAINE Though migraine causes great suffering for millions of people, there has been much success, in the last decade or two, in understanding what goes on during attacks, and how to prevent or minimize them. But we still have only a very primitive understanding of what, to my mind, are among the most intriguing phenomena of migraine -- the geometric hallucinations it so often evokes. As a child, I was fascinated by patterns, starting with the patterns in our house -- the square colored floor tiles on the porch, the tessellation of small pentagonal and hexagonal ones in the kitchen; the herringbone pattern on the curtains in my room, and the pattern on my father's check suit. When I was taken to the synagogue for services, I was more interested in the mosaics of tiny tiles on the floor than in the religious liturgy."

Some elevator companies say we need to replace them with steel rails, an expensive proposition. Others say we don't have to. Who is right? A ''This question comes up frequently,'' said Martin A. Walsh Sr., president of Walsh Associates, an elevator company in Manhattan. Mr. Walsh recommends that wood rails be replaced for a couple of reasons."
2008-02-17T00:00:00Z,"What were you are looking at here is different from the ''lingerie dressing'' of seasons past, a formula of satiny slip dress, fishnet stockings, maybe a bit of lace or fur trim, that left little to the imagination and required still less imagination to conjure in the first place. No, the new reveal as proposed by designers as far apart in their thinking as Akris and Rodarte does not trade in those sorts of sexual clichés. It doesn't even have much to do with actual nudity; it merely offers it up as a suggestion. For the Dutch artist Arno Nollen, who took the photographs on these pages, a series of random intimate encounters provided the basis for a book of portraits published in 2004. Those portraits, of ordinary young women on the streets of European cities, are considerably more revealing than what we can show here. But if there were ever a season to re-examine our ideas of what is considered risqué, indecent or even just plain sexy, it is spring 2008. As the New York Times fashion critic Cathy Horyn wrote of the designer Marc Jacobs, whose collections both for his own label and for Louis Vuitton perhaps raised the most eyebrows, ''There is more beauty and modesty in the way Mr. Jacobs exposes a bra strap than you see most days on the subway.''

But as Mark Twain might have put it, reports of the V-8's death were greatly exaggerated."
2008-02-17T00:00:00Z,"WADSWORTH--John (''Jack'') Taylor of Delhi, NY (formerly of Manhattan), passed away on February 9 following complications of lung cancer. Born on February 4, 1940 in New York City, he was the son of the late Robert L. and Elma Taylor Wadsworth. He received his primary and secondary education at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, his bachelors degree from New York University (mathematics) followed by graduate studies at Columbia University (linguistics). He served two years in the Army. Before his retirement, Jack had been an executive with Bankers Trust Company / Deutsche Bank in New York for 35 years. A true Renaissance man, he held positions there first in computer programming, then in finance and, finally, in corporate taxation, ultimately becoming Managing Director and head of the Bank's Tax Department. He was largely self-taught in all these fields. Despite possessing a towering intellect and being extremely articulate, he was unpretentious, giving equal respect to all, from the Chairman of the Board to the most junior employee. He was known for his easy wit, business savvy, dedication, and a mind that was a storehouse of knowledge on virtually every topic under the sun. Jack's devotion to his passions of music, woodworking, gardening, literature, and the wider worlds of the arts and sciences brought him and those around him much enjoyment and enlightenment, and gave him, during his retirement, incredible value as a member of many Delhi area non-profit organizations. He served as president of the Little Delaware Youth Ensemble, Friends of Music, and Delaware County Historical Association, as well as on the board of directors of Honest Brook Musical Festival, Delhi Senior Housing, and the Meredith Dairy Fest Committee. Surviving are his wife of 40 years, Rose Cupaiuolo Wadsworth, three nieces-in-law, other relatives and numerous friends. He was predeceased by a fosterbrother, Theodor Bicos, who is survived by his wife, Maria, and family of Utah. Jack was dearly loved by his wife, his extended family and his friends, all of whom will greatly miss him. A memorial service will be held later in the spring. Contributions in Jack's memory to Little Delaware Youth Ensemble, P.O. Box 206, Oneonta, NY 13820 will be appreciated."

Several years ago, I went to Cambodia to see the ruins at Angkor Wat, and after I went back to China I realized that there were actually three places in the world with these kinds of pyramid ruins: Cambodia, Mexico and Egypt.

2008-02-17T00:00:00Z,"KRECH--Dr. Shepard Jr., of Easton, MD, died February 11, 2008, at the age of 89. The son of the late Dr. Shepard and Mary Stevens Chapin Krech, he was born in New York on April 24, 1918. He graduated from Groton School in 1937, Yale College in 1941 where he was a member of Scroll and Key and the 150pound Football Team, and the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, in 1944. Following service as a Lieutenant in the Medical Corps, U.S. Naval Reserves, 1943-1945, and further medical training at Presbyterian, Roosevelt, Bellevue and Lenox Hill Hospitals from 1944-1948, he moved with his family to Easton, MD where, except for 1953-1954 in the Naval Reserves stationed in Guam, he was a general practitioner and family doctor until he retired in 1974. An avid sportsman and dedicated conservationist, he spent the years following his retirement from the medical profession working on behalf of non-governmental organizations and on gubernatorialappointed commissions. Dedicated to the preservation of farmland and the health of the Chesapeake Bay, he was an early proponent of minimizing the use of herbicides and insecticides, buffering their impact on watersheds, and controlling residential development along the shores of the bay and its tributaries. In 1995, the Maryland Chapter of the Nature Conservancy awarded him its Conservation Achievement Award for extraordinary contributions to Conservancy goals. A cofounder of the Maryland chapter of the Nature Conservancy, he served as trustee and chairman of that organization, president of the Wildfowl Trust of North America, chairman of Ducks Unlimited in Talbot County, and trustee of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the Chesapeake Wildlife Heritage, and the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy. In the 1970s he was appointed to the Wye Island Advisory Committee after the state of Maryland halted a major developer's plans for a dense waterside village on this island (his role in the controversy is detailed in the book Wye Island), and from 1984-1996 he served as a member of successive Chesapeake Bay Critical Areas Commissions. He also served as President of the Talbot County Board of Education during the implementation of Brown v. Board of Education, chief of staff of the Memorial Hospital, Easton, Vice-President of the Interstate PostGraduate Medical Society, and he taught anatomy and physiology at the School of Nursing at Memorial Hospital, Easton. He was a member of the American Medical Association, Blue Hill Country Club, Boone and Crockett Club, Chesapeake Bay Yacht Club, and a founding member of the Legal Limit Dove Club. For over 20 years he was president of the Board of Trustees of the American Memorial Hospital in Reims, France, and in 1976 was awarded the Legion of Honor. He will be remembered as a physician who opened his office to all regardless of race when he arrived in Talbot County in 1948, and who worked with others to make Memorial Hospital in Easton available to black people in its entirety, not just in the basement; as a family doctor who took great pride in house calls at all hours, by boat if necessary, and who accepted payment in kind; as an accomplished fisherman who, on the Spey River, unfailingly paid his bar bill with salmon; as a crack shot, second to none in his prime on upland and water birds as well as big game; as fiercely competitive in sports, games, and life, and never shy about voicing opinions; and as a tireless and passionate advocate for the environment. His wife Nora Potter Krech, whom he married on August 14, 1940, predeceased him, as did his sister, Mary Krech Gould and his brother Alvin W. Krech. He is survived by a brother, Merrill Chapin Krech of Coral Gables, FL, a daughter, Amy K.

My precious, beloved husband devoted his life to me, our children and grandchildren, and his sister and brother-in-law and gave us the most precious gift of all, his love. He became a legend in his own time, building Modell's Sporting Goods into the largest, privately owned sporting goods chain in the country. His brilliant business acumen earned him many honors and awards. Yet, his greatest pleasure was seeing all those he mentored succeed in their careers. During World War II, he proudly served in the Army's Ninth Air Corps and continued to serve his country and New York City throughout his life, as a member of the negotiating committee for the Panama Canal Treaty under President Jimmy Carter, as New York City's Commissioner of Public Affairs for Mayor Abe Beame, and as a founding patron of the Metropolitan Opera House and Lincoln Center for Performing Arts. Though he met world leaders, celebrities and many of America's greatest athletes, he was at heart a down-toearth man, who cared deeply about his family, friends, and . Associates. A humble and gentle man, he helped countless individuals in their time of need. He was the founder of American Digestive Disease Society, a co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation for Immunological Research and the Hewlett House for breast cancer survivors, and was especially dedicated to Gilda's Club of New York and Worldwide which he helped found. No cause meant more to Bill than finding a cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In 1967, when our son Michael was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, he co-founded the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America and raised many millions of dollars for research. Bill never realized his dream to find a cure, and we lost our darling Michael to complications caused by Crohn's disease six years ago. Yet, despite his unspeakable sorrow, Bill never gave up hope. He continued to raise millions to save others from the suffering that our son endured. For me, his children and grandchildren, his friends, and all those who knew him, Bill was a man who filled the world with his vibrant presence, his compassion and love, his sense of humor, his wisdom and integrity, his quiet courage, and his abundant goodwill. The services will be held on Sunday, February 17, 2008, 11am, Temple Emanu-El, 5th Ave at 65th St., New York. I have lost my best friend and partner in life and I am shattered with sorrow. Billy, you were and always will be my soul mate. I will love you and miss you forever. Your Shelby MODELL--William D. Dearest Bill, I will miss the good times we shared, especially reminiscing about our growing up years. You will always be my ''Bart Simpson'', charming and smiling while getting into so much mischief and I, your ''Lisa'', ''the goody, goody two shoes'' of the family. The story of how my name, Doris, became your middle initial, as in Wm. D. Modell, always brought a smile to our faces. I will love you forever, ''Big Bro''. ''Little Sis'' Doris MODELL--William. We have lost a very special brother-inlaw and friend, whom we loved. He was a wonderful husband, son, father, grandfather and mentor to many. Our entire family will sorely miss him.

Our heartfelt condolences go out to Shelby, Mitchell, Leslie, Doris and all of his grandchildren. We shall always remember Bill with love in our hearts. Paula, Jerry, Gregg, Steven, and Eric Modell MODELL--William. It is with much sadness that we recognize the grief my sister Shelby and her family are experiencing on the loss of their beloved Bill.

Our condolences to his loving wife Shelby, and the entire Modell family. Lisa & Norwood Richardson MODELL--William D. Bill Modell was a wonderful man and an inspirational leader. He and his wife Shelby have been our role models as patient advocates. Their work on behalf of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation serves as an example of the positive impact that an individual can have on the lives of others. There was no better team then Shelby and Bill Modell. Bill, you will be missed by all the people whose lives you touched. We will miss you. Mark and Diane Goldman MODELL--William.

Linda, Nina and I extend our heartfelt condolences to Shelby, Leslie, Mitchell, Doris and the entire Modell family. Bill, you are my hero. Gary J. Galperin MODELL--William. Dearest Bill (brother, brother-in-law, uncle, great-uncle, next door neighbor and friend). You always made us laugh, and today we weep. You were larger than life and today our hearts are broken. We are so proud of what you have accomplished. A humble man, you never boasted. You did it all with quiet dignity. The love we shared will remain with us forever. ''Goodnight sweet Prince may flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.'' The Tipograph Clan Doris, Norman, Lew, Sandi, Neil, Jill, Joe, Stu, Rachel, Ross, Lindsey and Austin MODELL--William D. Herb Pardes and Nancy Wexler, on behalf of the mental health community, mourn the loss of William D. Modell, a wonderful friend for more than two decades. Bill played a key role in advancing development of a new research building for the New York State Psychiatric Institute. A brilliant leader known for integrity, humor, and altruism, he endured much personal tragedy. But, through extraordinary dedication, he worked to lessen the suffering of others. He supported countless people and organizations that aid individuals struggling with Illness. We offer heartfelt condolences and affection to his wife, Shelby; daughter, Leslie; son, Mitchell; nine grandchildren; and other members of his family.

Yesterday, shortly after I pulled the covers over my head for a little nap, I received an email from Robert Triefus, who is Armani's head of communications. It was marked urgent and inquired if I had received a letter from Armani. I had not, but it didn't take a genius to know what the letter was about. Armani had decided not to invite me to his show and, of course, that was the intent of the letter, once I had read it. He didn't like the tone of my comments about his January couture show in Paris; specifically, he thought I was ""belittling"" of his family and friends. I had described their appearance and manner in the moments before the show. It was pretty innocuous stuff. Armani, though, didn't think so. I asked Triefus why Armani had waited until just before today's show to say something; the couture reviews had come out two or three weeks ago. Triefus said Armani had become preoccupied with his ready-to-wear show-we're up to fall 2008-and hadn't had time to return to the matter until now. ""That's our fault,"" Triefus said."

Born on August 9, 1921 to Meyer and Ethel Nebenzahl in Far Rockaway, NY, Paul grew up a devoted son and a loyal older brother to Kenneth Nebenzahl. Paul was the grandson of A. Louis Nebenzahl, founder of the Nebenzahl Department Store. Mr. Nebenzahl began his career in advertising at age 16 working as a mail clerk. Self educated after graduating from Lawrence High School, his career was interrupted by his distinguished service as a paratrooper and a member of the SF during WWII. Just before D-Day Mr. Nebenzahl participated in a covert operation led by the French underground to destroy all avenues of transportation available to the Germans, thus preventing them from reinforcing the western front. He was decorated for heroism by the United States, France, and China. He retired from advertising as the Chairman of Harrison Services after 56 years in the business. He spent his retirement traveling around the world spending time with his beloved family on Twin Lakes and at the Hodge Podge Lodge, campaigning for the Democratic party, taking gorgeous photographs, volunteering as a docent at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and occasionally enjoying a game of golf. He married Nancy Baar Nebenzahl, deceased, in 1947 and together they raised three children: Marcie, James, and Andrew. He is remembered as the most gracious man with a happy and warm smile. He leaves behind a legacy of great values, intellectual curiosity, political activism, commitment to family, and they hunger for adventure.

2008-02-18T00:00:00Z,"Despite Senator Barack Obama's strong showing in recent primaries, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton continues to hold onto more support from superdelegates, the Democratic Party elites, according to a survey by The New York Times and CBS News. The current count is 189.5 superdelegate votes for Mrs. Clinton and 142.5 for Mr. Obama. But in a similar survey conducted last month, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Obama by 204 to 99. About 8 percent of the total 795 superdelegates changed their minds over the last few weeks, as many states held their primaries and caucuses. Few delegates switched allegiance from one candidate to the other; the main changes were among the undecided delegates. Among the previously undecided delegates who now are endorsing a candidate, Mr. Obama got more of their support. Some of Mrs. Clinton's previous supporters are now undecided."

He came to Einstein as a postdoctoral research fellow when the College opened in 1955, and for more than a half-century our medical school has been the fortunate recipient of his scientific talent and creativity and his thoughtful, humane and compassionate leadership. He was among the most devoted, selfless and dedicated members of our community, willing to assume any role that was important to advancing the mission of our College of Medicine, its faculty and its students. A gentleman at all times, his equanimity, his soft-spoken manner and sense of fairness endeared him to one and all. He was named Professor of Medicine in 1969 and a year later became Einstein's first Chief of the Division of Hematology, a position he held until 1982. He twice served as interim Dean of the medical school, from 1972-1974, and from 1983-1984. He also served the medical school as Senior Associate Dean, Associate Dean for Faculty, and Director of our Belfer Institute for Advanced Biomedical Studies. Dr. Jaffe was widely recognized as one of the founders of modern hematology. He was the quintessential clinician and investigator-scholar, and made significant contributions to the understanding of hereditary anemias due to enzyme deficiencies and hereditary methemoglobinemia. One of the best-known hematologists in the country, he served as President of the American Society of Hematology; Editor-in-Chief of Blood, the Journal of Hematology; and Co-Editor of Seminars in Hematology. Albert Einstein College of Medicine was built on the shoulders of giants. Dr. Ernst Jaffe was one of those giants. His kindly and gracious presence in our lives is already greatly missed. We extend our very deepest condolences to his beloved wife of 57 years, Jayne; his daughter, Stephanie Anne Jaffe Green, M.D., Einstein Class of 1981, and her husband, Stephen; his son, Richard Jaffe and his wife Gwendolyn; and grandchildren Andrew, Christopher, Cortland, and Caroline.

Elsewhere, a chimp and a human toddler are taught the same technique for obtaining a piece of candy, only the chimp masters it more quickly. These are just a couple of findings about ape behavior that are causing scientists to rethink the intellects of chimpanzees, bonobos (like the one above), gorillas and orangutans. This ''Nova'' episode examines some of these discoveries, which are illuminating the differences between great apes and humans, and explores why apes never made the breakthrough into a human-style culture that builds on the achievements of past generations. 8 P.M.

But, as Paul Gambaccini points out in a comment, she is essential to the symmetry of the play. In the prologue, Beverly quotes T.S. Eliot's poem ""The Hollow Men"" to her: ""Life is very long."" And in that final scene, when Violet has finally driven the last of her daughters away, Johnna sings to her from the last lines of the same poem: ""This is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends."" (Eliot's punchline, not spoken in the play but entirely relevant: ""Not with a bang but a whimper."")"

It is also the region where women remain the farthest behind by any objective yardstick.""

Other pasta dishes - penne with seafood, garlic and chili, for example - cost slightly more: 95 baht. Chef Joe has the right credentials: he used to work at Gianni's one of the better and long-standing Italian restaurants in Bangkok. Bring your own bottle of wine to Jo-Joe Pasta (no corkage!) They also have beer for 55 or 65 baht a bottle.

The decision should pave the way for sale of the book in Japan for the first time in eight years. Although it decided that the book was not indecent, the Supreme Court rejected a demand by the publisher, Uplink, for government compensation of $20,370, according to Takashi Ando, a spokesman for the court. Takashi Asai of Uplink had been contesting the confiscation of the book in 1999 and his voluntary suspension of its sales in 2000 in response to police warnings. In the Supreme Court decision, by a majority of the five-judge bench, Justice Kohei Nasu wrote that the 384-page volume of black-and-white portraits, including 20 close-ups of male genitalia, “compiles work from the artistic point of view, and is not obscene as a whole.” Mr. Asai sold about 900 copies of the Japanese version of “Mapplethorpe,” originally published in Japan by Random House in 1994 without objection from the authorities. But airport customs officials, declaring the book obscene, confiscated Mr. Asai’s copy when he returned from a trip to the United States in 1999. He called the Supreme Court decision “groundbreaking” and said it “could change the obscenity standard” used for banning foreign films that depict nudity and for censoring photographs in books."

Born in 1928 in the Netherlands, recently of Cedarhurst, Long Island. Frieda passed away peacefully surrounded by her loving children on February 18, 2008, after a courageous battle with cancer. She is the daughter of the late Chief Rabbi of the Sephardic community of the Netherlands, HACHACHAM Rabbi Salomon Rodrigues-Pereira and his wife Henriette Emilia and devoted wife of the late Dr. Melvin M. Kramer and loving partner of Hans Werthauer. Frieda is the sister of deceased siblings, Martinus Rodrigues-Pereira, Miriam Van den Bergh, and Caro Zivi. She is survived by her brother Arnold RodriguesPereira and his wife Trudi, and sister-in-law Theresia Rodrigues-Pereira. She is also survived by her four children and their spouses: Carol Ruchelsman and her husband, Manny; Jonathan Kramer, M.D. and his wife Maria; Nancy Karp and her husband, Lloyd; and Salomon Kramer and his wife, Marci.

Frieda escaped Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in 1942 and came to settle in New York years later. Deeply proud of her Sephardic roots, she dedicated her life to caring for the world through volunteer work in hospitals and nursing homes, through the care of friends and community members, and through loving-kindness toward animals of every kind. She delighted in sharing laughter and food with friends and was known for her welcoming and abundant shabbos table. Frieda taught all of those she touched to celebrate life through her irrepressible joie de' vivre.

He came to Einstein as a postdoctoral research fellow when the College opened in 1955, and for more than a half-century our medical school has been the fortunate recipient of his scientific talent and creativity and his thoughtful, humane and compassionate leadership. He was among the most devoted, selfless and dedicated members of our community, willing to assume any role that was important to advancing the mission of our College of Medicine, its faculty and its students. A gentleman at all times, his equanimity, his soft-spoken manner and sense of fairness endeared him to one and all. He was named Professor of Medicine in 1969 and a year later became Einstein's first Chief of the Division of Hematology, a position he held until 1982. He twice served as interim Dean of the medical school, from 1972-1974, and from 1983-1984. He also served the medical school as Senior Associate Dean, Associate Dean for Faculty, and Director of our Belfer Institute for Advanced Biomedical Studies. Dr. Jaffe was widely recognized as one of the founders of modern hematology. He was the quintessential clinician and investigatorscholar, and made significant contributions to the understanding of hereditary anemias due to enzyme deficiencies and hereditary methemoglobinemia. One of the best-known hematologists in the country, he served as President of the American Society of Hematology; Editor-in-Chief of Blood, the Journal of Hematology; and Co-Editor of Seminars in Hematology. Albert Einstein College of Medicine was built on the shoulders of giants. Dr. Ernst Jaffe was one of those giants. His kindly and gracious presence in our lives is already greatly missed.

He was born in Chicago, Illinois, a long time resident of Tenafly, NJ, and, more recently, a resident of Port Washington, NY. Alma maters included Francis W. Parker School and the University of Chicago as an undergraduate and medical student. He was an intern and resident at Columbia University Presbyterian Hospital in New York.

2008-02-21T11:24:11Z,"When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, he talked, memorably and incessantly, about protecting those families who ""worked hard and played by the rules."" Sixteen years later, it appears ever more likely that the outcome of this year's Democratic nomination fight will rest, in the end, on how party leaders interpret the rules. As I've written here before, there is no real ideological divide in the party; most Democrats would seem to be satisfied with either Hillary Rodham Clinton or Barack Obama, so there's no reason to think either candidate's followers will automatically revolt if they lose. But no matter who wins, if the process itself ends up confirming the growing suspicion among voters that the rules are only there to be rigged, then the outcome could devastate a party whose central argument is all about fairness. Much has been written about the possible permutations in the Democratic race from here on out, but at this point it's fairly simple. After his victories Tuesday, Mr. Obama now has a slim but hard-to-surmount lead in ""pledged delegates"" - those awarded in state contests. If Mrs. Clinton were to win the trio of Texas, Ohio and Pennsylvania by huge margins, then she might be able to overtake him, but that doesn't seem terribly likely, given the dynamic of the race right now. Even so, neither candidate has much chance of emerging from the primaries with the 2,025 delegates needed to lock up the nomination, which means that even if Mr. Obama maintains his lead, Mrs. Clinton can-and probably will-fight on."

Minnesota and North Dakota are some of the current snowkiting hotspots where beginners, using their own skis, boots and snowboards along with the specialized kites, can figure out how to harness the breezes in just a few hours.

The police would have the option to send written notification to Immigration and Customs Enforcement on people detained but not arrested.

2008-02-21T00:00:00Z,"People who had surgery for spinal stenosis, a common back ailment, had less pain two years later than those who decided to skip the surgery, researchers said. They said the study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, should help patients make an informed decision when they develop the painful condition. “This study says surgery is better,” said the lead author, Dr. James Weinstein of Dartmouth. Spinal stenosis is caused by a narrowing of the spinal canal that gradually pinches off nerves in the spine, making it painful to stand or walk. The findings are part of a five-year, 11-state study looking at the effectiveness of common back surgery."
2008-02-21T00:00:00Z,"Heart surgery patients were more likely to die if given an antibleeding drug, Trasylol, two new studies have found. The manufacturer, Bayer, stopped selling the drug after a Canadian study was halted because of deaths. The research reignites a controversy over Trasylol, which was on the market for 14 years. The studies are being published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine. The first looked at about 10,000 patients who had bypasses at Duke University Medical Center from 1996 through 2005. It found that 6.4 percent of patients who were given Trasylol died within 30 days of the surgery, a rate nearly 2.5 times higher than patients who got another drug or who received no treatment for bleeding. The second study, financed by Bayer, looked at about 78,000 patients nationwide from 2003 to 2006. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers found the risk of death was 64 percent higher in the Trasylol group than in those taking a comparison drug."
2008-02-21T00:00:00Z,"Older Americans are having less trouble with their memories, and it may be because they spent more time in school, researchers said. They found that the rate of cognitive impairment fell 3.5 percentage points among people 70 and over from 1993 to 2002. “We found a clear relationship,” said Dr. Ken Langa of the University of Michigan, whose study appears in the journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia. “The more education people had, the better they performed on cognitive tests.” The researchers used data on 11,000 people from the Health and Retirement Study and compared data gathered in 1993 with data from 2002."

2008-02-21T00:00:00Z,"More than six months after the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles agreed to hand over 40 artifacts to Italy, the criminal trial of its former curator of antiquities lumbers on in Rome. A prosecution witness painstakingly presented the court with photographs and documents on Wednesday in an effort to establish that more than a dozen looted artifacts had made their way into the Getty’s collection. Marion True, the former Getty curator, is charged with conspiring to acquire illicitly excavated antiquities for the museum. Several of the pieces discussed on Wednesday by the prosecution witness, Daniela Rizzo, are now on view at the presidential palace in Rome as part of an exhibition of objects recovered from American museums in the last two years. Ms. Rizzo repeatedly projected an image of an artifact onto a screen next to a photograph of the same piece in a dirt-encrusted, unrestored state. For most of the pieces, she said, acquisition documents provided by the Getty did not cite the object’s provenance. “If it came from an authorized dig, it would say so and give a date,” she said. “The fact that it doesn’t makes you think, doesn’t it?” Ms. True and the American dealer Robert Hecht, who is on trial with her on similar charges, have both proclaimed their innocence. The next trial hearing is scheduled for mid-March."

On the interior surfaces, the bronze gleams a burnished coppery-gold.

He was born in Frackville, PA on April 1, 1921, the son of Charles and Mary Chevins, both deceased. His parents were immigrants from Lithuania and his father, a coal miner, died around the time of Tony's birth. He was the youngest of 10 siblings and his mother singlehandedly raised the seven children who survived to adulthood. During WWII, Tony joined the U.S. Navy and served as a pilot, flying a fighter plane from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. Following the war, he attended college on the G.I.

He rose to become Creative Director, and ultimately earned the position of President, then CEO and Chairman of the Board. When Cunningham & Walsh later merged with N.W.Ayer, he served as Vice Chairman. Anthony was active in numerous advertising organizations, including as Director of the National Advertising Review Board, the American Association of Advertising Agencies, and Speaker for the Advertising Educational Foundation's Ambassador Program. He served on the Board of Directors of the Medic Alert International Foundation and the Mickelberry Corporation. Tony remained an active alumnus of Syracuse University and also served on the S.U.D. Advisory Board, the Community and Publication Issues Council, the Newhouse Board and the Alumnae Club. He received the George Arents Pioneer Medal from Syracuse in 1987 as well as awards from Tau Beta Epsilon and Phi Beta Kappa. Tony was an avid golfer, belonging for many years to Woodway Golf Club in Darien, CT, National Golf Links in Easthampton, NY and the Card Sound Golf Club at Ocean Reef in Key Largo, FL.

Tony loved to be with people and made friends wherever he found himself. He will be grievously missed. He is survived by his wife, Margaret Macy Chevins, of Key Largo, FL, two children, Cheryl L. Davis (Jeffrey Noe) of Rhinebeck, NY and Christopher M. Chevins (Cheryl Peterka) of New York, NY, as well as several grandchildren; Jennifer Davis, Chelsea Noe, and Garrett, Corinna and Travis Lander. His daughter, Cynthia M.

He even had a film called “New York, New York” (though admittedly a box-office and critical failure).So it was rather disappointing that, after being shut out numerous times, the movie that won him an Academy Award for best director was “The Departed,” which (gasp!) is set in Boston.

If the two detectives can prove that they were not acting recklessly or with criminal intent in firing their first shots at Mr. Bell and his friends in Queens on Nov. 25, 2006, then the shots that followed — 40 more rounds between them — could be determined to be justified as well, said lawyers who have represented police officers in the past and people who have been briefed on the case.

Then his rustiness kicked in. Norman’s concentration wavered when a clump of grass blew across his ball in a greenside bunker on his 16th hole. Instead of pausing, he hit anyway — and failed to make it out, the ball rolling back to nearly the same spot. Then it happened again. Norman, making his second PGA Tour start of the year but only his fifth in four years, wound up with a double bogey. Another lapse of concentration on the next hole resulted in a three-putt from about 12 feet for a bogey. After coming up inches short of a birdie on the final hole, Norman walked off with an even-par round of 70 — tied for 40th.“I pretty much let a good one get away,” Norman said. “You need the feel for tournament play and I don’t have it. At the end of the day, I did hit some quality shots out there, so you know they’re still in the system.”The field was chasing John Merrick, who holed a roughly 50-foot putt on his final shot for a six-under-par 64 and a one-stroke lead."

For them every show is a playground, stretching the imaginations and the muscles of those who come to frolic as well as to watch. By the end of the next hour, the girl and her fellow pupils had been encouraged to shout directions, make swimming motions, sneeze loudly, twist like boiling pasta and sing ''On Top of Spaghetti'' at a volume that would make heavy metal seem like Bible study.

2008-02-22T00:00:00Z,"In its sweet, lackadaisical way, Michel Gondry's ''Be Kind Rewind'' illuminates the pleasures and paradoxes of movie love. Its two main characters, a pair of Passaic, N.J., loafers named Mike and Jerry, are devotees of the Hollywood mainstream, paying tribute to well-worn classics like ''Ghostbusters,''''Driving Miss Daisy,''''Rush Hour 2'' and ''The Lion King.'' The way they express this affection lands Mike and Jerry in a spot of copyright trouble, but they (and Mr. Gondry) provide a welcome reminder that even the slickest blockbuster is also a piece of handicraft, an artifact of somebody's nutty, unbounded ingenuity and the potential object of somebody else's innocent, childlike fascination. Mike (Mos Def) works in a shabby video store whose owner, Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover), has not yet made the leap to DVD. His business threatened by the dubious improvements of a city-backed redevelopment scheme, Mr. Fletcher sneaks away on a mysterious trip, leaving the blundering, well-intentioned Mike in charge of his stock of battered VHS cassettes. Jerry (Jack Black), an avant-garde auto mechanic and tireless tinkerer, suffers an accident that magnetizes his body, causing him to accidentally erase all the tapes."

2008-02-22T00:00:00Z,"Visitors to the annual orchid show at the New York Botanical Garden are accustomed to seeing and sniffing more than 8,000 blooms from all over the world. This year they will do so in a setting inspired by Singapore, a center of flower growing and hybridizing with a $20 million orchid industry. (Its national flower, the Vanda Miss Joaquim, is a native orchid hybrid discovered on the island by a Miss Agnes Joaquim in 1893.) An orchid-covered pagoda resting in a pool leads the way to an alley of orchid-covered arches; the designers looked to the Singapore Botanic Garden for ideas, said Francisca Coelho, a curator of the exhibition. This Sunday and next, Michael A. Morales, a founder of the Manhattan Orchid Society, will give a talk on the species cultivated in Asia, focusing on the dendrobium, cymbidium, phalaenopsis and vanda families of Singapore. The display also includes a hundred or so of the approximately 30,000 Old World and naturally occurring orchid species, as well as many of the 150,000 man-made ones. ''There's new stuff that's created every year,'' Ms. Coelho said. ''We have the parents of the plants that we're using to make new ones. Go smell the generations.''

A mobster trying to escape the underworld with his sweetheart is struck down on a train platform by a roving pack of trench coats. These are not scenes from a jazzy French New Wave film or an American Mafia tragedy, but from the violent and highly Westernized crime movies that flourished in Japan in the 1960s under Nikkatsu, one of the country's oldest studios. Unlike the sober historical work by Kurosawa and Mizoguchi, the Nikkatsu action pictures -- called akushon, they were churned out by the hundreds -- are quick-cut, intoxicating rides through noirish city alleyways and bars where gangsters order whiskey and take home the waitresses. Since September Japan Society has been presenting a monthly series of these films, none of which have been screened in the United States before."

Thankfully, the shows in that category -- which often have a leg up on their proscenium competition in terms of offering alcohol and a festive but seriously experimental atmosphere -- aren't as frequent. Take ''Live ****,'' situated in the unfinished basement of the Chocolate Factory in Long Island City, Queens. The artists who run it, Chris Peck and Chase Granoff, describe the series as ''an intermittent performance party situation.'' The next installment, on Saturday, features the wonderfully uncategorizable Karinne Keithley, whose talents run from choreography to publishing to film; the composer Jon Moniaci, whose movement and sound installation with Mr. Granoff, ''Boredom!!! (as an amplifier)'' (above, Mr. Granoff, top, and Mr. Moniaci) was one of 2007's most charming performance pieces; and Bárbara Bañuelos Ojeda, a Spanish choreographer whose work Mr. Granoff has never seen but whose ideas about performance intrigued him."

2008-02-22T00:00:00Z,"CHEVINS--Anthony C. (''Tony''), 86, of Key Largo, Florida and Quechee, Vermont, died Tuesday, February 12, 2008 at Mariners Hospital in Tavenier, FL, following a short illness. He was born in Frackville, PA on April 1, 1921, the son of Charles and Mary Chevins, both deceased. His parents were immigrants from Lithuania and his father, a coal miner, died around the time of Tony's birth. He was the youngest of 10 siblings and his mother singlehandedly raised the seven children who survived to adulthood. During WWII, Tony joined the U.S. Navy and served as a pilot, flying a fighter plane from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. Following the war, he attended college on the G.I. Bill, earning a Bachelors Degree in English and Journalism at Syracuse University, graduating Magna Cum Laude. He began work in the advertising industry in New York City in 1949, first with BBD&O and then in 1951, joining Cunningham & Walsh as a copywriter. He rose to become Creative Director, and ultimately earned the position of President, then CEO and Chairman of the Board. When Cunningham & Walsh later merged with N.W.Ayer, he served as Vice Chairman. Anthony was active in numerous advertising organizations, including as Director of the National Advertising Review Board, the American Association of Advertising Agencies, and Speaker for the Advertising Educational Foundation's Ambassador Program. He served on the Board of Directors of the Medic Alert International Foundation and the Mickelberry Corporation. Tony remained an active alumnus of Syracuse University and also served on the S.U.D. Advisory Board, the Community and Publication Issues Council, the Newhouse Board and the Alumnae Club. He received the George Arents Pioneer Medal from Syracuse in 1987 as well as awards from Tau Beta Epsilon and Phi Beta Kappa. Tony was an avid golfer, belonging for many years to Woodway Golf Club in Darien, CT, National Golf Links in Easthampton, NY and the Card Sound Golf Club at Ocean Reef in Key Largo, FL. He was an avid and accomplished photographer, a fisherman, an amateur gardener and an international traveler. He was actively involved after his retirement with public service work in the various communities in which he and his wife, Margaret, lived; publishing newsletters, managing an interdenominational chapel, running prayer groups and taking on whatever other organizational tasks were needed. Tony loved to be with people and made friends wherever he found himself. He will be grievously missed. He is survived by his wife, Margaret Macy Chevins, of Key Largo, FL, two children, Cheryl L. Davis (Jeffrey Noe) of Rhinebeck, NY and Christopher M. Chevins (Cheryl Peterka) of New York, NY, as well as several grandchildren; Jennifer Davis, Chelsea Noe, and Garrett, Corinna and Travis Lander. His daughter, Cynthia M. Chevins, predeceased him last year. Memorial services will be held in the Chapel at Ocean Reef, Key Largo on Sunday, March 30, at 4 PM. The family requests that memorial donations be made to The Cathedral of St. John the Divine, in New York (stjohndivine.org) or The Nature Conservancy (nature.org)."

For an emerging artist, a list like that might sound pretentious, but Ms. Root has been around long enough to get away with it. Her eight recent paintings, all made with enamel on shaped aluminum panels (and untitled, like the one at left), exhibit combinations of geometric forms and saturated colors -- a toothpaste green and a crocuslike violet, a warm gray and a wan chartreuse. It is probably no accident that they resemble comic-strip speech bubbles; in the past, Ms. Root has adorned her compositions with pairs of tiny eyes and trompe l'oeil cigarettes."

In a three-day trial that ended on Thursday, lawyers for the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, N.M., argued that Fisk lost the right to the prized collection and violated the terms of the 1949 gift when it took the works off display and tried to sell some. Fisk countered that it had never tried to sell the whole collection and that it now had the money to display the works according to the artist’s wishes. Seeking to shore up its finances, Fisk agreed in principle last fall to sell a 50 percent stake in the collection to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark., for $30 million. But on Feb. 8 Ellen Hobbs Lyle, a Davidson County Chancery Court judge, struck down that proposal, saying it went against the donor’s wishes. Now the judge will rule on whether Fisk has forfeited its right to the art and whether it should go to the O’Keeffe Museum, which represents the artist’s estate."
2008-02-23T00:00:00Z,"Odeon, Britain’s largest chain of moviehouses, will not show “Rambo” at its theaters this weekend, citing “commercial reasons,” Variety reported. This is the film’s opening weekend in Britain. The news has enraged fans of Sylvester Stallone, right, especially those who live in rural areas where their only local cinema is an Odeon. The company said “the decision not to screen ‘Rambo’ will free up screens to show alternative popular new films such as ‘Jumper,’ ‘Be Kind Rewind’ and ‘Juno,’ ” but there was speculation among British movie exhibitors that the cause of the abrupt move was a disagreement over terms between Odeon and Sony, the film’s distributor. “I can’t remember the last time this happened in the multiplex era,” one film booker said.

But what could have been a gracious ingress and egress was marred earlier when he busted a move down the carpet to leave a little early. Two guys came up on either side and walked him to a gate. They told him he could go in through the adjacent hotel. The Bagger knew better. He was ejected. The guys with the headpieces can smell fear, and the Bagger knew what was coming. He has finally hacked his way back in."
2008-02-24T21:48:58Z,"""'Who in the world am I?' Ah, that's the great puzzle!"" says Lewis Carroll's Alice after experiencing a sudden, disorienting growth spurt. While she meditates on this philosophical conundrum, her body changes again. The girl shrinks. I have asked myself the same question many times, often in relation to the perceptual alterations, peculiar feelings, and exquisite sensitivities of the migraine state. Who in the world am I? Am ""I"" merely malfunctioning brain meat? In ""The Astonishing Hypothesis"" Francis Crick (famous for his discovery of the DNA double helix with James Watson) wrote, ""You, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are, in fact, no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules."" Mind is matter, Crick argued. All of human life can be reduced to neurons."
2008-02-24T21:47:44Z,"The press room may be the worst place in the world to watch the Oscars, but the Bagger is beginning to notice a trend. Even though the strike lifted and the whole show is back on, Jon Stewart and the producers continue to insist on showing filmed segments that would have been broadcast, as if to menace the crowd with what might have been. Maybe it would have been worse, but for the time being, there seems to be an odd juxtaposition of hackery -- a filmed riff on telescopes and binoculars -- sentiment -- Jon Stewart going so sweet on the kids from ""August Rush"" -- and vamping -- pregger jokes about Cate Blanchett and Jessica Alba."
2008-02-24T21:25:34Z,"The press room generally likes a surprise as much as the next person -- ""Golden Compass for effects!????"" -- because it makes for a story that has a few twists and turns. But the newsies like a front-runner because it makes them feel smug and knowing. Which is why they yelled like 8-year-olds when the Javier Bardem won for best supporting male."

2008-02-24T21:21:01Z,"Philip Seymour Hoffman is under very little pressure this year, having been nominated for best supporting actor for his role in ""Charlie Wilson's War"" -- and it shows.

2008-02-24T19:54:22Z,"As John McCain comes ever closer to securing the Republican nomination, his age has remained notably absent as a campaign issue. So far it has attracted so little attention that the network exit pollsters have not included even one question on the subject in 23 state surveys - an extraordinary occurrence given that Senator McCain would be the oldest man ever to take office, if he were to win the presidency."

It was a stunning day, cloudless and mild. The first show for most of the editors and buyers was Balmain (the tightest, smallest pants and club tops in leather and metal mesh, nothing surprising) and a number of the guests had brought their young children. In the course of the day I heard a lot of things. Will Robert Rimondi and Tommaso Aquilano of 6267 take over Ferre? Is Hedi Slimane in negotiations for his own men's and women's label? Time will tell. I thought Slimane's pictures (in New York Magazine) of Carine Roitfeld were terrific, and evocative of her.

2008-02-24T15:44:33Z,"Carine Roitfeld, the editor in chief of Vogue Paris, bequeathed her children her soigné style as if it were their birthright. Her daughter, Julia Restoin-Roitfeld, is a freelance art director for the likes of Jean Paul Gaultier and was the face of Tom Ford's latest fragrance; her son, Vladimir Restoin-Roitfeld, is a film school graduate and a sometime model. Going to a fashion shoot when they were young, says Mom, was as normal as tarte Tatin. (The photographer Mario Testino is their godfather.) Many consider Roitfeld the stilettoed embodiment of modern dressing: she describes her style as ''tacky chic.'' Never afraid to take a risk, she has put a bearded drag queen on a cover and printed a fashion story with a model dressed as an Anna Wintour clone. After 20-plus years in the business, certain things have changed: ''I don't go too much to the parties now, but my kids do.'' Like their mom, they're always on the list."

2008-02-24T12:22:18Z,Crunch time. The Bagger picked the following in the biggies.
2008-02-24T12:03:50Z,"Over the past few days, unseasonable cold and rain in Los Angeles has occasionally given way to some moments when the sun breaks through, bathing the city in welcome light and flicking at the dampness. People will scan the sky, turning their face toward sun that is generally a prerogative of living here. (Update: 11:30 PST. Sunny but chill.)"
2008-02-24T12:02:13Z,"The Bagger's more carefully considered doppelganger has a point-counter point about the cultural value of the Oscars in the newspaper today with A. O. Scott, a real, actual movie critic. The package includes an audio file of the throw-down, but the overlords at the House of Many Doors edited out the part where Scott called the Bagger an ""ignorant slut,"" but it is still a lively and blessedly brief - the Bagger's voice has been compared to the sound cows emit when they get a batch of bad feed - podcast about the worthiness of the national bonfire of glitter and gamesmanship."
2008-02-24T11:54:29Z,"Every year, the Oscars pay a visit to that mid-Atlantic place where British and American culture mash up into something that combines Yankee rigor with English refinement. This year, that phenomenon shows up in the form of ""Atonement,"" with a young British director, Joe Wright, and ingénue Keira Knightley defining Anglophilian upper crust lust. And in the acting categories, you've also got your Tilda Swintons - who could win this year, btw - and Julie Christies, who is favored to win. Cate Blanchett is nominated, twice in fact, a sorta Brit from Australia."
2008-02-24T11:53:33Z,"Dan, the Bagger's digital peer, has been crunching some data: For the third straight year, our readers have weighed in on the race. The first year ... well, we let people vote more than once, so the results were just a tad skewed. But this year, the numbers look right, and in more ways than one. NYTimes.comers' votes align nicely with the general zeitgeist (though not necessarily with the Bagger's picks), though there are a few surprises. ""No Country"" gets picture, director, supporting actor and screenplay. But Daniel Day-Lewis is neck and neck with Johnny Depp for Best Actor. Cate Blanchett would win both actress awards if the readers were in charge."
2008-02-24T11:53:23Z,"When he learned I wanted to write a play, Jon Jory, who was then Artistic Director of Actors Theatre of Louisville, took me out to lunch and said, ""OK, here are the three mistakes you don't have to make."" And that's pretty much the way I teach to this day - telling writers the traps they don't have to fall into, not saying how it has to be done, just trying to save them some of their precious time. Over the years people have yelled at me for teaching the rules, or even for suggesting that there are rules. But I never expect these rules to be followed absolutely. They serve the same purpose as the boundary flags in ski resorts. You can ski in the ungroomed powder if you want, but you'd better know what you're doing, and be willing to take the risk. Still, we do not turn on the television to watch average skiers take safe trips down the green trails. We turn on the X Games to see heli-skiers land on the top of glaciers and shoot off the edges of the cliffs, or watch the great Shaun White ""shred some gnarly terrain"", as my son says. And that brings us to ""August: Osage County,"" a play that only seems traditional, but actually creates its excitement by breaking the rules."
2008-02-24T11:45:06Z,"This year's Oscars would have seemed to be a great time to innovate, to put together a show on the fly that perhaps attacks some of the creakiness and convention that is part of Oscar gospel. Ain't. Gonna. Happen. In spite of the fact that organizers had little more than a week to put together the show, this will be no ad-hoc Oscars. Look for the same glorious goo to be poured into the extant template. People who have seen the auditions say that there is a palpable desire for normalcy, for business as usual, but that means the same brutal copy will show up on the teleprompter and be beamed straight at you."
2008-02-24T11:43:58Z,"At yesterday's rehearsals, according to The Associated Press, Cameron Diaz, in a gray sweater, skinny black jeans and towering high heels, opened a prop winner's envelope and said, ""The Oscar goes to - your mama. No, I'm just kidding."""
2008-02-24T11:42:57Z,"Yesteday, Tom O'Neil took a seat on the high wire, suggesting that George Clooney could sneak past Daniel Day-Lewis in the best actor category. He got some company yesterday. The Bagger bumped into Tom Bernard, the co-chief honcho at Sony Pictures Classics, at the Spirit Awards. Bernard has a pretty good record in Oscar matters and has good sources among old members of the Academy, although he was wearing sunglasses that play MP3's, so there is that. (Dog the Bounty Hunter, who is staying at the Bagger's hotel, has a similar pair.) And Bernard said that Day-Lewis may not be the lock we have all said he was. ""You're probably right about Daniel Day-Lewis, but I wouldn't be surprised to see Clooney sneak in."""

2008-02-24T11:40:52Z,"Last night's Miramax party had all the trappings of a major Oscar bacchanal. Tight door, movie stars, even an appearance by the elusive Cormac McCarthy (the author of ""No Country for Old Men""). The Soho club here offered a great space and amazing views and even a smoking cage, a place where the muse often hunts the Bagger down, but no one wants to put both pom poms in the air - not the night before, and maybe not the night after. Strike, rain, macro-business problems, the death of Heath Ledger, blame it on whatever you want, but no one is doing the backstroke in Oscar froth this year."
