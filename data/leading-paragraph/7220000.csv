''Five of us were traveling -- we're all photographers and we all like to go to unusual places. We would never go to Rome, that's just too boring. This was our first trip that we organized by ourselves without a guide, truly based on five people's wants and desires. Seeing a desert was one of our big goals, and we all felt the desert in one area did not resemble the desert in another area, which was really surprising. The sand was different, the horizons even looked different. The oases that we visited were such pleasurable stops. You could see why caravans really looked out for these things, because there's nothing else around. You wonder how palm trees could possibly be in this location because there doesn't seem to be any source of water, but there is. The other thing was: you really do see mirages. I mean, that sparkling water in the distance, you swear it's there and you'll walk and you'll walk and after a half a mile, you'll realize, maybe it's really not there.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

2009-05-24T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''It's No Time to Stop This Train'' (Economic View, May 17), which argued that the Obama administration needs to avoid a mistake made by the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936: reversing the stimulus program too soon over a fear of inflation. Although there are some similarities between the economic crises of the 1930s and today -- both were systemic failures rather than mere cyclical downturns -- there are also huge differences. One of the biggest is in the monstrous and rapidly growing government debt. If the next crisis is precipitated by the Chinese declining to purchase United States government debt, some people will argue that we should have seen it coming and will criticize government for not cutting deficits sooner. I think that no one knows the correct course of action, and that the best we can hope for is that government doesn't make the situation worse, as it did in the 1930s. I'm not optimistic."

BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Obama sought to rebut criticism from all sides -- from fellow Democrats in Congress, who blocked money for closing the center and want detainees kept out of the United States; from rights advocates, who want an end to indefinite detention and military trials; and from former Vice President Dick Cheney, who called Mr. Obama's policies ''recklessness clothed in righteousness.''"

2009-05-24T00:00:00Z,"The rookie right-hander Ricky Romero was a big reason that what figured to be a mess of a Toronto rotation at the start of the season quickly turned into a strength. Romero, left, won two of his three starts, with a 1.71 earned run average, before straining an oblique muscle and going on the disabled list. Even though three minor league rehab starts were less than scintillating, the Jays will look to Romero to help settle things down after the rookies Brett Cecil and Robert Ray were exposed by the Red Sox. The Mets' John Maine took a step back in his loss to the Dodgers last week, but he has a chance to get healthy again with two starts at Citi Field. Maine has allowed four hits in his last 12 innings at home, and he draws the Nationals and Marlins this week."

The company said in a news release that it was looking for craftsmen to work in its paint, leather and woodworking shops. Although the company laid off several dozen temporary workers late last year and idled its factory for a few weeks as orders slowed slightly around the holidays, a rush of orders has been received for its new, smaller Ghost model. The concept was unveiled last month at the Shanghai auto show, and the production version should be ready to make its official debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September."

Born Paula Sherzer in Brooklyn, New York on March 23, 1911, she began working in the coal business in the 1930s. She started the Susquehanna and Chesapeake Coal Companies in the late 30s and as the first woman owner of a coal company, she disarmingly signed her name ""Paul Sherzer."" After the war, Paula moved to Los Angles, California where she spent most of her life, never losing her Brooklyn accent or New York sense of humor. She was a life force and the center of action for a large group of friends and family. Her zest for life was total and Paula got great joy from any child within reach, making a point of squeezing every tusch, cheek or body part close by. An incredibly positive attitude was her hallmark and she never waivered in her acceptance and love of everybody she encountered. Affectionately known as Grandma Paula or ""GP,"" she will be missed but never forgotten."

Cynthia had been ill for some years with primary progressive aphasia. She was valiant at every turn. Cynthia leaves many loving friends and family members, including two nieces and two nephews: Susan Lefferts of Salem, OR; Sarah Lefferts of Portland, ME; Thomas Lefferts of South China, ME; and Nicholas Lefferts of Denver, CO. Independent in mind and spirit, Cynthia had a keen interest in politics and in the life of the nation. Her working life was marked by high ideals. She began her career in 1951 as an administrative assistant at the Ford Foundation; she went on to serve as executive secretary of the New York State Commission on Government Operations of the City of New York and later of the New York State Moreland Commission on Welfare. She was a special assistant to Governor Nelson Rockefeller from 1963 to 1966, and then worked devotedly for Common Cause, serving in the 1970s as executive director of its New York office. Cynthia was born in Santa Barbara, CA, in 1928, while her parents, Halleck Lefferts and Sarah Barney Lefferts, were on the faculty of the Thacher School in nearby Ojai. Her brothers Barney and Charlie died before her, in 1976 and 1995. Cynthia was educated at Concord Academy and the Winsor School, and graduated from Vassar College in 1951. From an early age, Cynthia loved the mountains, lakes, and streams of the Adirondacks, where she had a second home. When the effects of polio kept her off the highest peaks, she continued to walk, hike, and swim with vigor, and she took up tennis with a gracious tenacity. She was a longtime member of the Ausable Club in St. Huberts and a trustee of the related Adirondack Mountain Reserve. In 2007 Cynthia was given the Harold Weston Award for ""personal dedication to the unique spirit and qualities"" of the AMR. She also served on the board of managers of the Havens Relief Fund Society in New York. She was especially proud to be a trustee of the Pomfret School in Pomfret, CT, where her father had been headmaster. Cynthia's grace and courage were inspiration and example to her friends and family. She had steel in her sinews, but she was never hard. She was kind and fair-minded, and naturally elegant.

The director Fran Rubel Kuzui’s production company, Kuzui Enterprises, has owned the rights to the franchise since producing the original 1992 feature film (which was written by Mr. Whedon and directed by Ms. Kuzui). Ms. Kuzui, who was also an executive producer on the “Buffy” television series, told The Hollywood Reporter that she was looking into a new film that would continue the idea of a guardian who protects the world from undead villains, but would not use the existing characters from the “Buffy” movie or television shows. Ms. Kuzui said the possibility of involving Mr. Whedon (the creator of the television shows “Firefly” and “Dollhouse”) had not been ruled out, and that the project had not yet been discussed with him.

Button and his teammate, Rubens Barrichello, dominated the race, from wire to wire, with a Ferrari driver, Kimi Raikkonen, finishing third for the team's first podium of the season. Ross Brawn, the owner and team principal of Brawn GP, was the technical director at Ferrari during its glory years with Michael Schumacher, and this season is reminiscent of those Ferrari days. Brawn has even begun comparing Button to Schumacher, reports the BBC. ""Rubens has had his occasions when he beat Michael and he was a pretty strong reference,"" Brawn said.

Throughout his illness Jack never lost the dignity, gallant courage, or determination that so marked his life. He is deeply mourned by his loving wife of 47 years, Eileen, and by their children, Cecilia Owen and Jennifer Powers. From his previous marriage, he is survived by John Powers, Jr. and Maribeth Moody. Born in New York, Jack served his country in WW II and later graduated from St. Peter's College. During his career in advertising, Jack served as President of McCann-Erickson in Europe and America, ultimately leaving that post to become the Chairman and COO of Heublein, Inc., now Diageo. He served on various boards and dedicated himself to charitable interests, particularly in education and medicine. Devoted to family and friends, Jack's life was shaped by perseverance. We will remember his integrity, his business acumen and his enchantment with his family and grandchildren. Jack was a memorable presence, with limitless vitality and a keen intellect, who sought challenges in every aspect of life. Friends knew him to be engaging, loyal, and unflagging in his support.

2009-05-26T00:00:00Z,"When North Korea suddenly announced Monday that it had conducted a second nuclear test, the initial view across the region was that this had been yet another defiant gambit by the North to extract more concessions from Washington. That has been the oft-repeated pattern in the past, and is likely to be one motivation now as well, say North Korea watchers. But this time around, North Korea's succession crisis is the primary impetus, many experts believe, suggesting that the audience for the test is its own population as much as the United States."

Scientists can judge the size of an underground nuclear blast by how violently it shakes the earth, although this method is not foolproof because conventional explosives can mimic the rumble. Experts can confirm the atomic origin by detecting the signature of radioactive gases and particles that a nuclear blast emits."

Ms. Kuzui, who was also an executive producer on the &#8220;Buffy&#8221; television series (starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, below left, with David Boreanaz), told The Hollywood Reporter that she was looking into a new film that would continue the idea of a guardian who protects the world from undead villains, but would not use the existing characters from the &#8220;Buffy&#8221; movie or television shows. Ms. Kuzui said the possibility of involving Mr. Whedon (creator of the television shows &#8220;Firefly&#8221; and &#8220;Dollhouse&#8221;) had not been ruled out, and that the project had not been discussed with him.

2009-05-27T00:00:00Z,"PATRICK--Julian. American baritone Julian Patrick died peacefully Thursday, May 7, 2009. A versatile singer, Patrick had a prolific fifty-year career singing concerts, musicals, cabaret, and opera, and towards the end of his life teaching. Born in Meridian, Mississippi, in 1927, Patrick came to music early in his childhood. After high school, he joined the Navy and served as a singer with Special Services. At 23, in 1951, he made his operatic debut in Mobile, Alabama, in La traviata. Shortly thereafter Patrick was drafted into the Army and was stationed in New York where he sang with the first Army Band. When he completed his service, he sang in night clubs and began auditioning for Broadway, where he made his debut in 1954 in Jerome Moross's The Golden Apple. Patrick was in the original companies of Once Upon a Mattress, Ziegfeld Follies, Bells are Ringing, and Fiorello. He revisited the musical stage often in his career for roles in works like 1776, Sweeney Todd, The Most Happy Fella, and South Pacific. In the mid-1960s, Patrick returned to opera as a principal of the Metropolitan Opera National Company (Figaro in The Barber of Seville and the Count in The Marriage of Figaro, among others) and toured the nation for two years; after it's demise, in 1967, he joined New York City Opera, making his debut in Douglas Moore's Carrie Nation the next year. Patrick sang in world premieres at City Opera of The Tempest by Lee Hoiby, Nine Rivers From Jordan by Hugo Weisgall, and Leonard Bernstein's Trouble in Tahiti. He worked with Dominick Argento on two world-premieres, singing the lead in Cassanova's Homecoming and a role specifically written for him in The Dream of Valentino. Mr. Patrick's most prominent work in contemporary American opera was with Carlisle Floyd in Of Mice and Men. Patrick sang the role of George in the world premiere of Of Mice and Men in 1970 at Seattle Opera. Patrick sang performed eighteen roles in nearly thirty productions with Seattle Opera, including Alberich in The Ring of the Nibelung in five different series of cycles over an eleven year period, as well as such comic roles as Dr. Dulcamara in The Elixir of Love. He also sang Alberich at the Metropolitan Opera on several occasions. Patrick sang at many other major U.S. opera houses, including San Francisco Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Washington National Opera, and Lyric Opera of Chicago. Overseas he was heard in many theaters, including the Netherlands Opera, Grand Theatre de Geneve, and the Vienna Volksoper. Mr. Patrick served as a professor of voice at the University of Washington from 1990 until 2005. He served as head of the vocal department from 1996 until 2005. He continued to teach and coach young singers until his passing. Mr. Patrick's work was recorded for RCA, Columbia, Desto, and various other labels. Mr. Patrick is survived by his partner of fifty-six years, Donn Talenti. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorials and tributes be made to Seattle Opera. A memorial service will be held at 2pm on June 27 at the Nesholm Lecture Hall of McCaw Hall at Seattle Center."

2009-05-28T00:00:00Z,"A federal district judge in Manhattan said Tuesday that a class-action lawsuit charging fraud and other misconduct could proceed against the Andy Warhol Foundation and the board that authenticates Warhol’s work. The suit was filed by a filmmaker, Joe Simon-Whelan, who bought a Warhol painting, above, in 1989 only to see it later declared inauthentic on two occasions by the board, even though, he contends, Warhol’s estate determined earlier that it was real. Mr. Simon-Whelan maintains that beyond his case the foundation and board have conducted a 20-year conspiracy to inflate the prices for Warhol works — and thus the value of the foundation’s holdings — by denying the authenticity of a certain number as a way to create artificial scarcity. The board and foundation have denied the accusations and sought to have the suit dismissed. Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled that Mr. Simon-Whelan had asserted his allegations “plausibly” enough for the case to continue to the discovery phase on many of its claims."

The basswood model takes the house's components - from its window frames to its innovative copper-piped radiant-heating system - and explodes them, so that they seem to hang in midair.This and five other models in the exhibition were designed and made by Situ Studio, a four-year-old Brooklyn multidisciplinary firm known for its cutting-edge approach to digital design and fabrication technologies. It's current projects include fabricating a bamboo and birch lobby for One Jackson Square, a soon-to-be-completed building by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates. The Guggenheim curators chose Situ because they were determined not to go the usual architectural-model route and they even put a clause in Situ's contract forbidding the use of those fuzzy little hobby-shop trees."

In ''The Great Train Robbery'' (1979), above, at 10:15, a couple of crooks (Mr. Connery and Donald Sutherland) plot to steal a fortune in gold from the safe of a moving train. And in ''Robin and Marian'' (1976), at 12:15 a.m., an aging Robin Hood (Mr. Connery) returns to Sherwood Forest to pick up where he left off with Maid Marian (Audrey Hepburn) and the Sheriff of Nottingham (Robert Shaw).

2009-05-30T00:00:00Z,"PEARLMAN--Amalia (""Mali"") Cecile Rapaport, internationally acclaimed artist, died peacefully at home on May 27, 2009, at the age of 90. Mali was born October 10, 1918, in Zborov in what would become Czechoslovakia. The youngest of four sisters, she moved to Brooklyn, NY with her family in 1920, where her father, scholar Charles David Rapaport (""Pop""), helped found a shul and she became an avid Dodgers fan. She graduated from Brooklyn College and later earned a Ph.D in Fine Arts from NYU. In a match of opposites, she married engineer and inventor Lester Pearlman in 1939; they would complement each other for over 50 years. In 1949, the Pearlmans moved to Bethel, CT where they spent 20 years raising their five children. They next lived in Israel before moving to Sunnyvale, CA. In 1992 after Lester died, Mali moved to San Francisco, where she rooted for the Giants against the traitor Los Angeles Dodgers and established an art studio. Pencil or brush always in hand, Mali saw the world through artist's eyes. Known best for her authoritative watercolors and calligraphy, Mali exhibited in shows throughout New England as well as in Paris, Palm Beach, Jerusalem, San Francisco and New York. Her work won her numerous prizes and acclaim from the New York Times and other art critics for its ""unliteral lyricis[m],"" ""lightness and sparkle"" and ""elusive washes of pure jeweled color."" She proclaimed: ""My goal is to express the inexpressible the universe within me because I must."" The Norwalk Hour noted ""Dr. Pearlman has a rare gift in arriving at the essence of the matter in a most poetic fashion."" Mali is a founding member of the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. An extraordinary caricaturist, among her courtroom sketches is one of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg; the Justice called it a ""gem"" and proudly features a print of it in her private collection. Mali was also a member of the Rocky Neck Artists Association, the oldest artist colony in the country, in Gloucester, MA, where she often spent summers with her elder daughter, Leslie, painting and showing her work. Mali taught her children contour drawing, poker, how to make an adventure of a misadventure. A natural wordsmith, she enjoyed Scrabble and solving acrostic puzzles, once discovering her father was quoted in the solution. Her creativity was contagious. She wrote and directed family silent films of Shakespeare. She also loved chess, baseball, tennis, her family, and anything beautiful. She was a unique Mom and Bubba and a world class inimitable artist with an unpresumptuous presence. She survived her husband Lester and two of her five children, Austin and Jared. Her unfailing honesty, quick wit, flawless style and bright smile will be missed by her daughters Leslie and Lise, her son Justin; her grandchildren Aram, Naomi, Rebecca, Jessica, Anna, Jamie, Amalia, David, David and Laura; her great-grandchildren Ben, Tim, Zack, Allison, Mian, Abe, Gary, Maggie, Avila and Safara, and many other family and friends. Funeral services will be held at noon on Sunday, May 31 at the Children of Israel cemetery, Miry Brook Road, Danbury, CT. A memorial exhibit is planned for later this year in San Francisco, CA. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Sinai Memorial Chapel (925) 962-3636"

2009-05-31T00:00:00Z,"Niall Ferguson claims “that crises are more often caused by bad regulation than by deregulation” (May 17). Our current credit problems have been caused by both. Only a few commentators remember that it was Henry Paulson, who then was chief executive at Goldman Sachs, who led the 2004 request for the S.E.C. to exempt investment banks’ brokerage units from the old net-capital rules that limited their debt leverage. Furthermore, William H. Donaldson, who was the S.E.C. chairman, and his staff decided to rely on the investment firms’ own computer models to measure investment risk. A recipe for disaster was in place. One can hope that Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, and Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary, as well as Mary Shapiro, the current S.E.C. chairwoman, will reinstate some effective form of the old net-capital rules. The “haircuts” required worked well for many years. They can and must do so again.james zucker."
2009-05-31T00:00:00Z,"The idea of relocating an entire island population is radical and may at some point become unavoidable (Nicholas Schmidle, May 10). The Maldives are a unique place of beauty and serenity, however, and giving them (and a couple of dozen other island states) up to global warming and rising sea levels must be a last resort and not a first best option. We have caused global warming, and we should take responsibility for it now and come up with a lot more ideas, efforts and resources to contain its negative effects. Many ideas have been floated by more or less qualified individuals and organizations. We can try to seed algae growth in the South Pacific with iron powder to extract carbon from the atmosphere. We might pump large amounts of seawater into the Saharan desert to create a huge salt lake, which would potentially feed underground aquifers and natural rainfall in Northeast Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Or we could cover vulnerable glaciers in Greenland with reflective tin foil during the summer months. These are just a few ideas that might help and would not cost billions. Is there an international discussion forum for scientists from different disciplinary and national backgrounds to exchange their views on the feasibility and side effects of existing and new ideas? Have we even started to seriously dedicate our minds to the matter? Or are we still stuck in the Bush administration attitude that global warming is either not happening or not as bad as it sounds or at least not going to strike in our lifetime?."
2009-05-31T00:00:00Z,"Myron Scholes, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and arguably the inventor of credit-default swaps, refers self-assuredly and guiltlessly in his interview with Deborah Solomon (Questions for Myron Scholes, May 17) to the Black-Scholes equation used to measure risk and transfer risk and to banks that need models to measure risk. This past year illustrates the irony of even a trace of confidence in such models. The influential British statistician (and chemist) George Box — a pioneer in the areas of quality control, time series analysis, design of experiments and Bayesian inference — is noted also for his warning about models: all models are wrong, but some are useful. That caveat should be a warning plastered across every forecast on risk, public or private."
2009-05-31T00:00:00Z,"Regarding William Safire’s On Language column (May 10): Necessity, which John Milton aptly called “the tyrant’s plea,” is a word beloved of political leaders who seek to evade responsibility for their acts. When our Great Decider chose to invade Iraq without clear proof that it threatened either us or its neighbors, he called it “a war of necessity . . . we had no choice.” But in October 1962, when surveillance photographs clearly showed that Soviet missiles deployed in Cuba threatened the American mainland, President John F. Kennedy overruled all those — and there were many — who thought war was necessary. Choosing instead to blockade Cuba until the Soviets withdrew their missiles, he showed what can be freely done by a commander in chief bent on avoiding war until it becomes absolutely necessary."

A graduate of the New York City public schools and City College, Morris served in WWII in the European Theater as an officer in Patton's 3rd army. He attended NYU Law School on the GI Bill, which brought him an education and a life he'd never dreamed of. Morris taught taxation at NYU Law where he received an LLM, and for 50 years practiced tax law in New York. In June 1949 he married the beautiful Norma Luloff, later a fashion writer at Vogue, with whom he lived for 58 years. Morris was absolutely devoted to his wife and two children. He had a lifelong passion for Beethoven, Mozart and Brahms, 19th century literature, old film, amateur singing, proper grammar, and progressive politics. He was predeceased by his wife Norma and son Philip, both of whom he tended with loving care. Morris is survived by his adoring daughter Ruth, his loving niece Lorna Peterson and her family, Dale, Zach and Seth, and by his faithful caregivers and friends. Morris Friedman was a generous, honorable, and humble man. His memory can be honored by donations to the Equal Justice Initiative, 122 Commerce Street, Montgomery, Alabama. A memorial celebration of his life will be held in the coming months."

2009-05-31T00:00:00Z,"The 1974 adventure series about three companions trapped in a prehistoric world (whose working titles included ''Lost'') spawned a 1991 remake that ran for two seasons on ABC's Saturday morning schedule. In the mid-1990s the Kroffts struck a deal with the Walt Disney Company for a film adaptation of the show; two different scripts were prepared by two different writers, but the Kroffts were disappointed with both. ''Everybody wanted to do another episode, and that just really didn't work,'' Sid Krofft said. ''It needed something special.'' The brothers moved the property to Sony's family division, which the studio shut down on the day a new ''Land of the Lost'' script was delivered. Finally they joined up with Mosaic Entertainment Group, the powerhouse management company, whose clients Jim Carrey and Will Ferrell were considered for the lead role. (Mr. Ferrell, a ''Land of the Lost'' fan since childhood, got the job.) The project landed at Universal, where Mr. Ferrell's longtime collaborator Adam McKay (the director of ''Anchorman'' and ''Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby'') considered directing, as did Robert Rodriguez (''Sin City''), before Brad Silberling (''Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events'') was signed. The film cost an estimated $100 million, or as Marty Krofft said, ''more, probably, than the whole career we did.''"

''I had been wanting to go to Maui for about 30 years because my husband comes from a very famous Hawaiian family, the Charles Brewer family. They were originally whalers; his great-great-grandfather arrived in Hawaii on a clipper ship in the 1840s, and the next generation had plantations and ran C. Brewer & Company. So I wanted to explore that and see if I could find remnants. I've got 12 books in print including the ''Mind Chronicles'' trilogy, an exploration of my own past lives. I did 100 sessions under hypnosis, and this is where it gets interesting: I discovered that I was my husband's grandmother. The deepest reason I went to Maui was to see if it was one of those places that felt like I'd been there before. And it was. Now that I dragged him there we're going to go back every two years; it's just exquisite.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

It was relative, though: While cabins are a step up from tents, they generally have no electricity, indoor plumbing or heat other than a wood or oil stove. They do have bunks, but no mattresses, cooking stoves or utensils. Plan on bringing sleeping bags, pads, a cookstove and cooking gear, and all necessary food and drinking water (or a water purifier).

The towers beckoned to the working class as a coveted antidote to some of the city's unlivable residential spaces and, later on, its unfathomable rents. These were not the projects of idle, stinky elevators, of gang-controlled stairwells where drug deals go down. In the 1940s, '50s and '60s, when most of the city's public housing was built, a sense of pride and community permeated well-kept corridors, apartments and grounds. Far from dangerous, the projects were viewed as nurturing. There are more than 400,000 residents in the New York City Housing Authority's 2,611 buildings at any given time.

A dedicated son of City College, Mr. Ross created the Michael and Irene Ross Program in Jewish Studies at his alma mater early last year. ""Mr. Ross' generosity and vision in coupling his love for his alma mater with his love for Judaism and Yiddish culture has enabled City College's thriving Jewish Studies program, which gives students from diverse backgrounds new insights into their own experiences, to become even stronger,"" President Williams said. The Michael and Irene Ross Program in Jewish Studies includes new offices, conference space and a library, and supports scholarships, publication of a newsletter, and a wide range of activities, including conferences, lectures, visiting professorships and student and faculty trips to places of significance in Judaism and Jewish culture. Close to 100 majors and 500 other students are taking coursework in the area. In addition to endowing the Program in Jewish Studies, the gift from Mr. Ross establishes the Michael and Irene Ross Chair in Hebrew and Yiddish. The College will conduct a national search for a prominent scholar to fill this position. A graduate of Seward Park High School, Isadore Rovinsky, as he was known then, majored in social science at City College. He also participated in intramural swimming and was vice president of Theatron. Early in his career, he formed a comedy partnership with a CCNY classmate, Bernard West, Class of 1939. Together, they created and produced some of the most famous shows in television, including the breakout sitcom ""All in the Family,"" which explored prejudice and the social mores of the 1970s, and earned Mr. Ross and Mr. West an Emmy for Outstanding Writing Achievement in Comedy in 1973. Other shows Mr. Ross worked on include ""The Jeffersons"" and ""Three's Company.""

Just bike east to the Klickitat River, she said, turn left, and you'll be there in no time. I was skeptical. To my right was the Columbia River, wide and as steely as the clouds above. To my left, a sheer rock face, behind which rose yet more hills -- the hills that led to my ultimate goal, three promising wineries in the Columbia River Gorge. Back in Oregon, the wines, particularly down in the Willamette Valley but also along the Columbia, were well-known, easier to reach and, thanks to a decade-plus of buzz, not exactly affordable."

Based on a mix of vetiver and tonka (a vanilla substitute), with notes of amber and lemon, the warm, citrusy fragrance has sold out twice since hitting Barneys last month. Ben Gorham, an art school graduate who founded Byredo in 2006, isn't all that surprised. ''It has a power and character,'' he said. ''People have just fallen for it.'' Come the end of June, Byredo will introduce its next fragrance, Blanche, a soft clean scent based on the idea of innocence -- loosely translated."

2009-05-31T00:00:00Z,"The 1969 television series, about a boy (Jack Wild of ''Oliver!'') in a magical realm run by a dragon mayor, established the trippy bona fides of the Kroffts, who say they were inspired by the era's colorful counterculture but never indulged in it. It gave birth to a 1970 feature film whose cast included Cass Elliot of the Mamas and the Papas. Sony attempted a big-budget remake around 2001, with Julian Fellowes (''Gosford Park'') attached to write the script, but dropped the project. (The lesson learned: ''Don't have anybody around who didn't grow up with the shows,'' Marty Krofft said.) The studio is now looking to revive ''Pufnstuf,'' with Dennis McNicholas (a screenwriter of ''Land of the Lost'') writing and Conrad Vernon (''Shrek 2,'' ''Monsters Vs. Aliens'') directing. The Kroffts hope Johnny Depp plays the villainous sorceress Witchiepoo, though they emphasize that Mr. Depp is not attached to the film."

This season it is popping up all over the place, in a slew of bright summery hues: bubblegum pink and turquoise at Lanvin (pictured here on the Teen Vogue editor Amy Astley, inset); lavender and acid yellow at Just Cavalli; electric blue at Temperley. For her latest Topshop collection, which arrived in the New York store on May 25, Kate Moss did a swingy cocktail dress in a baby blue variation. ''There must be something in the air,'' said Ulrika Lundgren, the stylist turned designer behind the Swedish label Rika.

At 23, in 1951, he made his operatic debut in Mobile, Alabama, in La traviata. Shortly thereafter Patrick was drafted into the Army and was stationed in New York where he sang with the first Army Band. When he completed his service, he sang in night clubs and began auditioning for Broadway, where he made his debut in 1954 in Jerome Moross's The Golden Apple. Patrick was in the original companies of Once Upon a Mattress, Ziegfeld Follies, Bells are Ringing, and Fiorello. He revisited the musical stage often in his career for roles in works like 1776, Sweeney Todd, The Most Happy Fella, and South Pacific. In the mid-1960s, Patrick returned to opera as a principal of the Metropolitan Opera National Company (Figaro in The Barber of Seville and the Count in The Marriage of Figaro, among others) and toured the nation for two years; after it's demise, in 1967, he joined New York City Opera, making his debut in Douglas Moore's Carrie Nation the next year. Patrick sang in world premieres at City Opera of The Tempest by Lee Hoiby, Nine Rivers From Jordan by Hugo Weisgall, and Leonard Bernstein's Trouble in Tahiti. He worked with Dominick Argento on two world-premieres, singing the lead in Cassanova's Homecoming and a role specifically written for him in The Dream of Valentino. Mr. Patrick's most prominent work in contemporary American opera was with Carlisle Floyd in Of Mice and Men. Patrick sang the role of George in the world premiere of Of Mice and Men in 1970 at Seattle Opera. Patrick sang performed eighteen roles in nearly thirty productions with Seattle Opera, including Alberich in The Ring of the Nibelung in five different series of cycles over an eleven year period, as well as such comic roles as Dr. Dulcamara in The Elixir of Love. He also sang Alberich at the Metropolitan Opera on several occasions. Patrick sang at many other major U.S. opera houses, including San Francisco Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Washington National Opera, and Lyric Opera of Chicago. Overseas he was heard in many theaters, including the Netherlands Opera, Grand Theatre de Geneve, and the Vienna Volksoper. Mr. Patrick served as a professor of voice at the University of Washington from 1990 until 2005. He served as head of the vocal department from 1996 until 2005. He continued to teach and coach young singers until his passing. Mr. Patrick's work was recorded for RCA, Columbia, Desto, and various other labels. Mr. Patrick is survived by his partner of fifty-six years, Donn Talenti. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorials and tributes be made to Seattle Opera. A memorial service will be held at 2pm on June 27 at the Nesholm Lecture Hall of McCaw Hall at Seattle Center."

The bride's mother had gathered a swath of organza at the hip with a feathered flower. The train fell to the side. The dress had the spirit of the silent movie era and recalled an autumn bride, top right, with a band of heirloom lace covering her forehead. I saw many bridesmaids in black, some carrying black calla lilies, and young men in rakish fedoras. But some things never change: after the posed photos, it's off with the elegant shoes, and on with the flip-flops."

On one taping with him on my old PBS show, the news had just broken of the attempt to ban the teaching of ''the theory of evolution'' in schools. I archly asked him if he would submit his own children to the ''poisonous teachings of Charles Darwin.'' He said he would as readily as he would expose them to ''the poisonous teachings of Isaac Newton.'' He stated his ''respect for people's religious beliefs'' but not for ''this particular bit of nonsense.'' Jonathan observed that referring to the ''theory'' of evolution is like saying the ''theory'' of gravity. Jonathan spouts original insights and observations on just about anything. Once, as we waited backstage to go on together at the 92nd St. Y, I pointed disapprovingly at his lit cigarette, causing him to talk entertainingly about some of the ironic rationales of the smoker who's aware he's doing wrong: ''I know these will kill me. I'm just not convinced that this particular one will kill me.''"

He was 55 years old. Mr. Stabile, a senior vice president in charge of Human Resources for the ""People"" department as it is called by the airline, was part of the team that fostered the company's culture and oversaw the growth of JetBlue from 1,600-11,500 crewmembers during his eight year tenure. Recently he assumed a senior advisory role with the corporation. Known for his interpersonal skills, Vinny, as everyone called him, began his career as an Executive Trainer and Employment Manager with Macy's New York and then continued in the retail world with Saks Fifth Avenue from 1981 forward in various Human Resource positions both at the flagship store and in the corporate offices before moving to Ziff Davis Publishing in 1996 as the Director of Human Resources.

Finally, on September 11, 2001, he joined JetBlue as ""Vice President of People."" Vinny Stabile was passionate about music and a gifted, self-taught guitarist and singer. He played solo and in numerous bands during his life, joining a Mamaroneck- based group called ""The Circuit Riders"" in 1995. This band performed for over twelve years at charitable events in the tri-state area as well as venues such as the New York City Marathon, The Bitter End, corporate retreats, private parties and numerous other community events. When the Circuit Riders ended their run in 2007, Vinny joined Free Lunch Rock Band also based in Mamaroneck. Vinny's priorities in life were always clear to anyone he met: his love for his family, his positive, down to earth attitude, extraordinary work ethic and his playfulness. Vinny was a devoted husband and father, a special friend, trusted colleague, mentor and advisor who touched the lives of so many. Vincent J. Stabile was born in the Bronx, graduated from Regis High School in Manhattan in 1971 and received a BS from Fordham University in 1975.

The museum, designed by the American architect Richard Meier, has been a source of controversy since its 2006 opening. At that time, it was the first major civic building completed in the city’s historic center in more than a half-century, but critics said that its angular modern design clashed with the classical architecture surrounding it. The vandals pelted the museum’s white wall with balloons filled with red and green paint. They also left a porcelain toilet and two packs of toilet paper nearby. The museum houses a carved sacrificial altar that was built in 9 B.C. for the emperor Augustus as a symbol of Roman peace and restored in the 1930s by Mussolini."

The Queen Charlotte Track, located on the South Island, is sometimes compared to the Appalachian Trail, but as Angus Phillip wrote, ""The Queen Charlotte Track is to the Appalachian Trail what the Ritz-Carlton is to a homeless shelter."" Among its calling cards: easy access to overnight lodgings like the No Road Inn, in which for about the equivalent of $240 a night, you get a spacious room with a flat-screen TV, terrycloth robes and ""a steaming hot tub made from an old wine barrel,"" as well as superbly prepared meals, including a boxed lunch to take with you when you head off toward your next refueling (and pampering) spot. Mr. Phillip does point out that there are less expensive lodging options for hikers who insist on roughing it, but that he prefers ""walking in the finest way, with full stomachs, no heavy packs on our backs, soft beds and crisp sheets waiting. It sure beats the Appalachian Trail."""

In an interview in The Telegraph, the author John David California said that his coming novel, called “60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye,” would feature a 76-year-old character called Mr. C, who wanders the streets of New York after he escapes his nursing home, in a manner similar to Holden Caulfield’s escape from an elite prep school. In The Telegraph, Mr. California said that Mr. Salinger was “a great writer who influenced the entire world with the words he made up” and said that his novel was “a tribute the way Holden would have said it.” In the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, lawyers for Mr. Salinger said, “The sequel is not a parody and it does not comment upon or criticize the original. It is a rip-off pure and simple,” according to Reuters."

The rapper then stormed out of the ceremony. In a post on his blog, Scott Aukerman, a writer for the event, said: “Yes, the Bruno/Eminem incident was staged. That’s all anyone wants to talk about, so let’s get it out of the way. They rehearsed it at dress and yes, it went as far as it did on the live show then.” The post on Mr. Aukerman’s blog was later taken down."

Probably the most thematically appropriate — given the shaken state of the art market and the art world as a whole — is the schoolchild’s maxim on a huge sign dangling from a sun-bleached facade near St. Mark’s Square: “I will not make any more boring art.” John Baldessari, whose influence over many of the artists showing this year makes him one of the event’s presiding deities, first made the statement in prints almost 40 years ago.

In the course of researching America's most distinctive contribution to drink culture, he delved into the newspaper accounts, memoirs, and cocktail recipe books that describe this strange interlude in American history, as well as searching the archives of Joseph Urban, the Ziegfeld Follies designer who created some of New York's lavish speakeasies, and savored the gin-soaked fiction of writers like John O'Hara (""Butterfield 8""), Elmer Davis (""Friends of Mr. Sweeney""), and Dashiell Hammett (""The Thin Man'') to get the full flavor of the period. He has come to the firm conclusion that Americans looking for a good cocktail should zero in on 1909 or 2009 as their best bet, and write off the Roaring 20s. Great jazz, bad booze. If you'd like to ask Mr. Grimes a question about Prohibition or speakeasies submit it as a comment below and he'll respond in a later post."

She was the beloved wife of Fred Weiss, mother of Ron, Toby and John Weiss and mother-in-law of Jocelyn and Teri Weiss and Alison Stone. Dorothy was adored by her four grandchildren; Meredith Levy, Jennifer Weiss, Rebecca Weiss, and Michael Weiss, and by her two great-grandchildren, Andrew and Jane Levy. Dorothy was a dear and loving sister to Pauline Sinow and husband Dr. Garland Sinow, of Long Beach, California, and aunt to their children, Dr. Jordan Sinow and Elisabeth Hutchinson, as well as to Fred's niece, Linda Spencer, of Philadelphia. Dorothy was born on October 2nd, 1920 in St. Paul, Minnesota. Her family moved to Los Angeles where she met and married Fred Weiss in 1940. They lived in Cambridge, MA and St. Louis and eventually settled in Piedmont, California in 1946. While in Piedmont raising their three boys, Dorothy worked for the Women's League of Voters and began what would become her long relationship with the Oakland Museum. She established its Gallery Shop in 1959 and in 1961 initiated the Museum's docent program. In 1977 she joined her two dear friends Virginia Breier and Sue Meyer to create the Meyer, Breier, Weiss Gallery on Fillmore Street in San Francisco, which later moved to Fort Mason. When the gallery was established, Dorothy and Fred were living in Houston as part of Fred's long career with Shell Oil, but they moved back to Piedmont permanently in 1980. The Dorothy Weiss Gallery opened in 1984 at 256 Sutter Street and focused on contemporary ceramic and glass sculpture with an emphasis on non-functional, sculptural work. The Gallery closed in 2000 but Dorothy took great pleasure in maintaining her relationships with her many artists, collectors, and longtime supporters. In 2001 Dorothy received a Visionary! award from the Museum of Craft and Folk Art (now called The Museum of Art and Design) in New York for her contribution of ""exciting exhibitions of some of the best contemporary work in clay and glass in the United States at her gallery which was a mecca for art collectors and artists from all over the country.""

Services will be held on Wednesday June 3rd at 1:00pm, at Temple Sinai, 2823 Webster Street, (at 28th St.) Oakland, 94609.

Professor Katzir was the fourth President of Israel and one of the Weizmann Institute of Science's founding faculty members. He founded and headed the Department of Biophysics, and in doing so, laid the foundation for enzyme engineering today a critical component of the food and pharmaceutical industries. In addition to his scientific research, Professor Katzir was a pioneer in the social and educational aspects of science. His attention to these issues did not wane when he was elected President of Israel, in 1973; nor did his curious spirit rest when his term ended, in 1978. Rather, he returned to his work at the Weizmann Institute and was given the prestigious title of Institute Professor. Professor Katzir was fundamentally dedicated to the mission of bettering humanity; he enacted this commitment through his impressive achievements in science, culture, education, and politics; he embodied and pursued what he called the ""universal human values that emphasize the kinship of the human race,"" among them freedom, peace, honesty, respect, and love. Professor Ephraim Katzir engendered these qualities. He succeeded in benefiting the human race. We send heartfelt condolences to the entire Katzir family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Lawrence S. Blumberg, Chairman American Committee Pennie Abramson, President American Committee Marshall S.

In the suit, filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Cher said that executives at the label had “engaged in wrongful tactics” that prevented her and Mr. Bono’s heirs from receiving revenues they are owed from compilation albums. Under the terms of her recording contracts with two labels that were absorbed by Universal, Cher said that she is supposed to receive up to 50 percent of net royalties from the label; Mr. Bono was also entitled to a share of royalties under one of the deals. The suit says that Universal funneled profits on a 1999 album, “Cher The Greatest Hits,” through its international division to avoid paying these royalties. A Universal spokesman told The Hollywood Reporter that the claims were “meritless.”"

He added: “We did our background checks and we were very impressed. Nothing was brought to our attention.” Mr. Walcott is to teach a master class in poetry there starting in the fall."

""Crazy Good"" is ""not a harness racing book -- that would be the road to poverty and bankruptcy,"" he said. Instead it's a history lesson of sorts, recounting a time when horses were part of everyday life and how one world-record-setting horse in particular captured the attention of the nation. Leerhsen's two and a half years of painstaking ""detective work,"" as he calls it, contributes to the vividness of the story of a racing hero from the early 1900s and the colorful characters associated with him. Many lessons and themes from ""the age of endurance"" resonate today: think the beginnings of the steroids era and the concept of marketing athletes as brands. Leerhsen will be reading from ""Crazy Good"" at 7 p.m. Thursday at BookCourt in Brooklyn."

Lynch is currently collaborating with the music producer and artist Danger Mouse on the installation ""Dark Night of the Soul,"" which is on view at the Michael Kohn Gallery in Los Angeles through July 11.Fifty of Lynch's photographs, some straightforward (a pair of dice sitting on a green shag carpet) and some quite bizarre (a giant man's head being served on a platter in what appears to be a '70s family dining room), are mounted in this two-room installation. The works create a visual narrative for the album ""Dark Night of the Soul,"" by Danger Mouse and the recording artist Mark Linkous (a k a Sparklehorse) with a host of other vocalists including Iggy Pop and Suzanne Vega. Visitors will get a simultaneous aural and visual experience that can continually change their perceptions of these photographs. A shot of a surge protector at the base a night stand takes on many meanings; it could be a fire hazard, a future murder weapon or just a source of electricity. A bobby-soxer grilling on the beach becomes sinister when you consider they way she holds that two-pronged fork. As with much of Lynch's work, you will think about it for a long time."

2009-06-03T00:00:00Z,"In an unusual but welcome development for theatergoers hoping to see “God of Carnage,” the Tony Award-nominated comedy by Yasmina Reza, its producers announced on Tuesday that the play would extend its run through Nov. 15 with its cast intact — after shutting down for part of the summer. The play, which stars James Gandolfini, Marcia Gay Harden, Hope Davis and Jeff Daniels as two Brooklyn married couples who gather to settle a playground fight between their sons and share an afternoon of philosophy and violence, opened at the Bernard Jacobs Theater on Broadway in March. All four actors have been nominated for Tony Awards; Matthew Warchus has been nominated for best director of a play; and the production is up for best play. The cast members were under contract through late July, and it had been unclear if any would stay on if “God of Carnage” extended its run. In a statement, the lead producers Stuart Thompson and Robert Fox said the show would shut down after the July 26 performance so that its stars could fulfill other commitments, and resume on Sept. 8. Tickets for the new set of performances will go on sale Wednesday."

Bob was also an accomplished professional photographer, whose images have been publicly exhibited in New York City and Putnam County, New York, and published in books and magazines.

Tolkien, who say they are owed profits from New Line Cinema’s film adaptations of the “Lord of the Rings” novels, Variety reported. Judge Ann I. Jones of Los Angeles County Superior Court denied a motion by lawyers for New Line asking her to decide on the suit’s claims, clearing the way for a trial to begin in October. Last year, trustees of the Tolkien Trust, a British charity, joined trustees of a private family trust of Tolkien heirs and the British arm of HarperCollins Publishers in suing New Line for breach of contract, saying they are owed at least $150 million from the movies’ gross receipts. In their complaint, the plaintiffs said the three movies generated about $6 billion in box office receipts and revenues from DVD sales."
2009-06-04T11:09:12Z,"When Whitney Houston released her last studio album of original material, “Just Whitney,” in 2002, she was still the happily married spouse of Bobby Brown who had never starred in a reality television series and had never been impersonated by Maya Rudolph on “Saturday Night Live.” Needless to say, much has changed since then. Now Ms. Houston, the best-selling R&B and pop star, is planning to put out a new studio album. In a news release, Arista Records said it would release the album, whose title was not given. The label has handled all of Ms. Houston’s releases dating to her self-titled 1985 debut, and it said she had sold more than 170 million albums, singles and videos since then. In 2007, Ms. Houston was said to have started work on a new album that would include material from R. Kelly, Diane Warren and other producers. It is not known if any of this material will appear on her new record."

Since at least 2007, the game developer Double Fine Productions has been at work on Brutal Legend, a game that features Mr. Black (“School of Rock”) as a heavy-metal roadie in a fantasy land. It was originally to be released by Vivendi Games, now part of Activision Blizzard, which apparently dropped the title. In December, Electronic Arts announced that it had acquired the game. In its suit, Activision said that it still has a contract to release the game and had invested about $15 million in its development, according to The A.P.

2009-06-04T15:20:51Z,"Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan, the newly installed archbishop of New York, plans to see the Broadway play “Irena’s Vow” on Saturday night, according to a publicist for the show. Written by Dan Gordon, “Irena’s Vow” centers on the story of a real life Polish Catholic housekeeper (played by Tovah Feldshuh) who protected Jews during World War II. “He chose ‘Irena’ because of all the clergy who have glowed to him about it, and he is particularly interested in Judeo-Catholic relations,” said the publicist, Rick Miramontez. The attendance of the archbishop, who took up his post in New York in April, is a well-timed boost for the show’s supporters: The Tony Awards ceremony is on Sunday night, and “Irena’s Vow,” which received mixed reviews from critics, did not draw any Tony nominations."

In the suit, filed on Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Cher said executives at the label had &#8220;engaged in wrongful tactics&#8221; that prevented her and Mr. Bono&#8217;s heirs from receiving the revenues that they are owed from compilation albums. Under the terms of her recording contracts with two labels that were absorbed by Universal, Cher said she was supposed to receive up to 50 percent of net royalties from the label; Mr. Bono was also entitled to a share of royalties under one of the deals. The suit says Universal funneled profits on a 1999 album, &#8220;Cher the Greatest Hits,&#8221; through its international division to avoid paying these royalties. A Universal spokesman told The Hollywood Reporter that the claims were &#8220;meritless.&#8221;."

2009-06-04T00:00:00Z,"GLOVES are as integral to boxing as sneakers are to running. Just as shoes protect the feet and absorb shock while running, so too do gloves cushion and shield the hands while punching. And as sneakers have become complex highly engineered human-propelling devices, the technology that goes into a pair of boxing gloves has improved beyond a couple of inches of foam padding. Features like interior contouring to help position the thumb, moisture-wicking liners, supportive wrist cuffs and gel padding maximize hand and wrist protection and comfort. Technology's improvements have grown alongside an increase in the sport's popularity. The number of amateur boxers registered as members of USA Boxing, the national governing body for the sport, was 29,986 in 2008, up 28 percent from the 23,436 registered in 1999."

The Veuve Clicquot Manhattan Polo Classic, held on May 30 at Governors Island, drew a tradition-minded straw-hat-and-seersucker crowd and with it more than its share of self-styled eccentrics. Intent on upending convention, guests like Chloë Sevigny (far right) softened the patrician cast of her ivory Chloé blazer with playfully scalloped shorts, while the racily turned out young women below subbed little black dresses for the customary lawn-party whites. In homage perhaps to Prince Harry (atop his pony, bottom left), others at the match, a benefit for the orphans of Lesotho, affected a sportingly upper-crust look. Among them was LL Cool J (bottom center), in a tailor-made fawn-colored suit, and Michael Arenella, (in seersucker, below), who showed off white braces and ascot, which he imagined might capture the mood. After all, as Mr. Arenella noted, smiling broadly, ''I'm here rubbing elbows with the beautiful people.''"

The multiplex owners had wanted revenue-sharing to be based on factors like a film’s budget and the stars in its cast. After about eight hours of talks on Thursday, the two sides struck a deal."

Since the release of the movie, Rubina Ali has accumulated enough material for a second book: a British tabloid said her father had tried to offer her for adoption in exchange for money (the police in Mumbai said they could not found evidence of this); and her family's shanty home was demolished by authorities in preparation for India's monsoon season (state officials said the family would be given a new home in suburban Mumbai).

2009-06-05T00:00:00Z,"JONES--Robert Wagenseil, 76, of Westbrook, CT, died in Middlesex Hospital on May 15, 2009, after a brief illness. Robert was born on March 22, 1933, in Providence, RI. He was descended from Governor William Bradford of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and preceded in death by his parents, Robert Bradford Jones and Hazel Wagenseil Jones, and by his beloved son, Adam Simmons Jones, in 1984. A graduate of Moses Brown School in Providence, Robert received his Bachelor of Architecture degree from Cornell University in 1956, where he was a member of Psi Upsilon fraternity. He was elected to membership in Tau Beta Pi and Phi Kappa Phi, scientific and engineering honor societies, and was awarded the Alpha Rho Chi architecture medal and an AIA second grant. He was an associate of Charles Luckman Associates, and director of architecture for Donald Deskey Associates in New York. In 1965, he and Serge Petroff founded a partnership and, in 1970, merged with Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon Associates, builders of the Empire State Building. Their plan to add ten stories to the building in order to maintain its status as the tallest building in the world created much controversy. The firm won a Progressive Architecture award for its proposed addition to the United States Embassy in Paris. Robert was later director of architecture for Rockefeller Center. His own firm, Robert Wagenseil Jones and Associates subsequently won a Progressive Architecture award for its design for the Goebel Collectors Club. Robert continued his practice when he moved to Connecticut in 1980 to concentrate on residential and commercial development. A past member of the New York chapter of the AIA and the New York Society of Architects, Robert served for many years on the board of Moses Brown, and was deeply involved with its master plan and the design of new buildings. A passionate yachtsman all his life, with a particular love of wooden boats, Robert was a member of the Grand Banks Owners Association and a past member of the New York Yacht Club. The sight of another boat however distant anywhere on the Sound was Robert's signal to start racing in earnest, whether the other boat was aware of it or not. Robert is survived by his long-time companion, Elinor T. Fine of Connecticut and New York, his daughter, Sarah Winifred Wagenseil Jones, and three grandchildren Alyona Grace Jones, Pavel Henry Jones, and Anderson Pavel Jones, all of Mebane, North Carolina. Truly larger-than-life in every way, Robert was a uniquely talented and creative visionary with fearless opinions and an irreverent wit. He will be forever missed by those who loved and cherished him. In lieu of flowers, a donation may be made to Mystic Seaport, 75 Greenmanville Avenue, Mystic, CT, 06355. A memorial ceremony will be held on July 19, 2009, at 2pm, at Brewer Pilots Point Marina, 63 Pilots Point Drive, Westbrook, CT."

Mr. Bonnard was a founding member of the Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce in New York in 1969. His contributions to the growth and development of the Chamber, and to the creation of stronger business relations between Brazil and the United States in general, were far reaching and will be deeply missed. In 1970 Mr. Bonnard instituted the ""Man of the Year"" award, now known as the ""Person of the Year"" award, to honor two innovative and forward-thinking leaders (one from Brazil and one from the U.S.) who have made extraordinary contributions to the forging of closer ties between the two nations. He served as Chairman of its Organizational Committee until his passing. From 1948 to 1967 Mr. Bonnard was Head of the Brazilian Aeronautical Commission's New York Office. From 1960 to 1967 he was accredited to USIS and to the UN as representative and correspondent for the Rio de Janeiro newspapers ""O Dia"" and ""A Noticia"".

Almost immediately, I started working on multi-portrait drawings from those photographs. I went on to make a series of drawings based on a 1964 yearbook from the Bronx, then I turned to my wife's 1972 yearbook from her high school in Cheyenne, Wyo. When I make these drawings, I can't help but think about the people I'm depicting. I make up stories in my head about them, wondering what they were like (or are like), calculating how old they'd be now and the chances that they're still alive. Before long, I started acquiring yearbooks. I found that the older ones, especially, have wonderful quotations to go with the pictures. The drawings below come from two yearbooks in my collection; the names and quotations are verbatim. -- JEFF ZENICK, an artist"

The physicians and staff of the Continuum Cancer Centers of New York (CCCNY) join with the entire St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center family in acknowledging with sadness the passing of our dear friend and generous benefactor, Paul Nicholls, an inspiration to all who were touched by his extraordinary spirit. Paul did not see cancer as an obstacle, but rather as an opportunity to help others. Despite dealing with life-threatening Stage 3 myeloma, he first began raising money to fight this dreaded disease in 2003 when he first ran the New York City Marathon. This effort led to the establishment of Team Continuum, through which others joined with him to support a wide variety of important programs at the CCCNY sites. He will forever be remembered by all whose lives were touched by his efforts.

During his long career at Allegheny, Mr. Kern served as Chairman of the English Department, Dean of the College and held the Frederick F. Seeley Chair.

Among the many people he touched are the hundreds of students and young writers he taught and mentored, many of whom remained devoted friends throughout his life. Born in Alliance, Ohio, in 1924, Mr. Kern served in the U.S. Army Air Corps in the Pacific Theatre during World War II, returning to Allegheny to finish his degree. It was there he met and married Carole Franklin, his wife of nearly 62 years.

2009-06-06T00:00:00Z,"JONES--Robert Wagenseil, 76, of Westbrook, CT, died in Middlesex Hospital on May 15, 2009, after a brief illness. Robert was born on March 22, 1933, in Providence, RI. He was descended from Governor William Bradford of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and preceded in death by his parents, Robert Bradford Jones and Hazel Wagenseil Jones, and by his beloved son, Adam Simmons Jones, in 1984. A graduate of Moses Brown School in Providence, Robert received his Bachelor of Architecture degree from Cornell University in 1956, where he was a member of Psi Upsilon fraternity. He was elected to membership in Tau Beta Pi and Phi Kappa Phi, scientific and engineering honor societies, and was awarded the Alpha Rho Chi architecture medal and an AIA second grant. He was an associate of Charles Luckman Associates, and director of architecture for Donald Deskey Associates in New York. In 1965, he and Serge Petroff founded a partnership and, in 1970, merged with Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon Associates, builders of the Empire State Building. Their plan to add ten stories to the building in order to maintain its status as the tallest building in the world created much controversy. The firm won a Progressive Architecture award for its proposed addition to the United States Embassy in Paris. Robert was later director of architecture for Rockefeller Center. His own firm, Robert Wagenseil Jones and Associates subsequently won a Progressive Architecture award for its design for the Goebel Collectors Club. Robert continued his practice when he moved to Connecticut in 1980 to concentrate on residential and commercial development. A past member of the New York chapter of the AIA and the New York Society of Architects, Robert served for many years on the board of Moses Brown, and was deeply involved with its master plan and the design of new buildings. A passionate yachtsman all his life, with a particular love of wooden boats, Robert was a member of the Grand Banks Owners Association and a past member of the New York Yacht Club. The sight of another boat however distant anywhere on the Sound was Robert's signal to start racing in earnest, whether the other boat was aware of it or not. Robert is survived by his long-time companion, Elinor T. Fine of Connecticut and New York, his daughter, Sarah Winifred Wagenseil Jones, and three grandchildren Alyona Grace Jones, Pavel Henry Jones, and Anderson Pavel Jones, all of Mebane, North Carolina. Truly larger-than-life in every way, Robert was a uniquely talented and creative visionary with fearless opinions and an irreverent wit. He will be forever missed by those who loved and cherished him. In lieu of flowers, a donation may be made to Mystic Seaport, 75 Greenmanville Avenue, Mystic, CT, 06355. A memorial ceremony will be held on July 19, 2009, at 2pm, at Brewer Pilots Point Marina, 63 Pilots Point Drive, Westbrook, CT."

The young Dutchwoman Etty Hillesum wrote that in a Nazi transit camp in 1943, on her way to her death at Auschwitz two months later. Towards the end of his life, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""All I have seen teaches me to trust the creator for all I have not seen,"" though by then he had already lost his father when he was 7, his first wife when she was 20 and his first son, aged 5. In Japan, the late 18th-century poet Issa is celebrated for his delighted, almost child-like celebrations of the natural world. Issa saw four children die in infancy, his wife die in childbirth, and his own body partially paralyzed.I'm not sure I knew the details of all these lives when I was 29, but I did begin to guess that happiness lies less in our circumstances than in what we make of them, in every sense. ""There is nothing either good or bad,"" I had heard in high school, from Hamlet, ""but thinking makes it so."" I had been lucky enough at that point to stumble into the life I might have dreamed of as a boy: a great job writing on world affairs for Time magazine, an apartment (officially at least) on Park Avenue, enough time and money to take vacations in Burma, Morocco, El Salvador. But every time I went to one of those places, I noticed that the people I met there, mired in difficulty and often warfare, seemed to have more energy and even optimism than the friends I'd grown up with in privileged, peaceful Santa Barbara, Calif., many of whom were on their fourth marriages and seeing a therapist every day. Though I knew that poverty certainly didn't buy happiness, I wasn't convinced that money did either."

2009-06-07T15:30:40Z,"Neither rain nor pressure nor the startling, scary appearance on Court Chatrier of an idiot fan could keep Roger Federer from his appointed round with tennis history Sunday, as he dispatched the up-and-coming Swede Robin Soderling in three straight sets.On Saturday I alluded to the fact that, throughout the spring season, Federer worked on patterns that would be effective against Rafael Nadal. In many ways, this led to Federer's getting into trouble in some earlier rounds, especially against Jose Acasuso and Tommy Haas. He returned to some of his tried-and-true patterns Sunday, working his forehand crosscourt to perfection and opening the court to either play an inside-out forehand, or his preferred shot to the forehand corner, whipping the ball with blinding racket-head speed and wrongfooting his opponent. He did this countless times against Soderling, but he also employed a tactic he's honed to take on Nadal: the drop shot. The shot was first suggested by Jose Higueras before last year's French Open, but it took a while for the stubborn artist in Federer to buy into the tactic.With today's players playing so far back in the court to defend, the drop shot would be wide open, or so thought Higueras, one of the game's top coaches and a great clay-courter in his day. Notice where Fed dropped those shots: down the line on his backhand and crosscourt on his forehand. This, of course, would be on Nadal's backhand, forcing him to play a one-handed slice approach. An effective drop shot would also prevent Nadal from playing so deep on defense."

I don't know what more is to be done, given that I have already submitted my resignation. I just hope that when all of this comes out, this institution doesn't take the hit, but rather the hit is taken by those individuals who occupied positions at O.L.C.

His writings and lectures on the relation of humans with the cosmos and the earth have notably influenced the intellectual and spiritual history of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Originally named after his father, William Nathan Berry, founder of Berico Fuels Company (1924), this second of eight sons in a family of thirteen children adopted the name Thomas (after philosopher-theologian Thomas Aquinas 1225-1274) following 1933 entry into the Passionist Religious Order. Thomas began doctoral studies in history at the Catholic University of America, writing on the historical theory of Italian philosopher- historian Gianbattista Vico 1668-1744, published by the Catholic University of America Press in 1951. Thomas's awards include seven honorary doctorates; the United States Catholic Mission Association Award (1989); the 1992 James Herriot Award of the Humane Society of the United States; Honorary Canonship of the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine (1992); the 1993 Bishop Carroll T.

(The Shelburne Museum was founded by Electra Havemayer Webb and her husband J. Watson Webb whose parents were Dr. William Seward Webb and Lila Vanderbilt Webb.

It might seem synergistic for ABC to replay taped features that ran earlier on ESPN's hours of pre-Belmont coverage. It might seem like a reasonable redeployment of resources to show the ABC audience what it might not have seen on ESPN. But it was lazy. A friend alerted me that he had seen all these elements, which made up the guts of ABC's nonlive coverage: features on the influence of horse-racing lexicon; on long shots; on Calvin Borel, Mine That Bird's jockey; and Kenny Mayne's wearisome attempt at wringing humor out of singing and playing 20 questions in a pickup truck with Mine That Bird's trainer, Chip Woolley, who sounded as if he had barely memorized a poorly written script."

He was never heavy handed; sometimes it worked. He was invited to join the ""Young Presidents Organization"" and soon became its president. He brought vitality and innovation to that organization. He was passionate about everything Jewish. He became a benefactor of the National Committee on Furtherance of Jewish Education and Chairman of the Chassidic Art Institute.

His death was announced on his WWII unit's memorial website: ixengineercommand.com. Sandy Conti was born on December 17, 1918 in Brooklyn, NY. From an early age, Sandy's classmates and teachers recognized his talent for learning foreign languages. Despite the Great Depression, he graduated from New York University with a degree in French Literature. Sandy served with the U.S. Army Air Corps, 834th Engineer Aviation Battalion, Company C from April 1942 to October 1945. On the morning of D-Day +1, Sandy and his unit landed in Normandy on Omaha Beach. Before D-Day, the Office of Strategic Services tried to recruit Sandy, but the officers of the 834th--knowing that his linguistic skills would be needed after the invasion-- would not relinquish him. During his service as a translator, he regularly worked with members of the French Resistance. As a reward for his services, the U.S. Army assigned him to the University of Grenoble for additional language training. Among his fondest memories of the war were talking with Ernest Hemingway at Mont Saint Michel, and flying in an airplane for the first time over the French countryside. After the war, Sandy resumed his education at Columbia University and received a Masters in French Literature; Dwight Eisenhower signed his diploma. He was an instructor and a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. Because of his close friendship with William Dean Fausett, the painter, Sandy split his time between New York City and Dorset, Vermont. During his time in Dorset, Sandy worked as a set designer and photographer for numerous opera productions. After spending 17 years teaching Foreign Languages for the New York City Board of Education, Sandy spent his retirement learning about emerging digital technologies, trading investments online, attending productions at the Metropolitan Opera, and contributing information to World War II historians and journals."

2009-06-07T00:00:00Z,"JONES--Robert Wagenseil, 76, of Westbrook, CT, died in Middlesex Hospital on May 15, 2009, after a brief illness. Robert was born on March 22, 1933, in Providence, RI. He was descended from Governor William Bradford of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and preceded in death by his parents, Robert Bradford Jones and Hazel Wagenseil Jones, and by his beloved son, Adam Simmons Jones, in 1984. A graduate of Moses Brown School in Providence, Robert received his Bachelor of Architecture degree from Cornell University in 1956, where he was a member of Psi Upsilon fraternity. He was elected to membership in Tau Beta Pi and Phi Kappa Phi, scientific and engineering honor societies, and was awarded the Alpha Rho Chi architecture medal and an AIA second grant. He was an associate of Charles Luckman Associates, and director of architecture for Donald Deskey Associates in New York. In 1965, he and Serge Petroff founded a partnership and, in 1970, merged with Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon Associates, builders of the Empire State Building. Their plan to add ten stories to the building in order to maintain its status as the tallest building in the world created much controversy. The firm won a Progressive Architecture award for its proposed addition to the United States Embassy in Paris. Robert was later director of architecture for Rockefeller Center. His own firm, Robert Wagenseil Jones and Associates subsequently won a Progressive Architecture award for its design for the Goebel Collectors Club. Robert continued his practice when he moved to Connecticut in 1980 to concentrate on residential and commercial development. A past member of the New York chapter of the AIA and the New York Society of Architects, Robert served for many years on the board of Moses Brown, and was deeply involved with its master plan and the design of new buildings. A passionate yachtsman all his life, with a particular love of wooden boats, Robert was a member of the Grand Banks Owners Association and a past member of the New York Yacht Club. The sight of another boat however distant anywhere on the Sound was Robert's signal to start racing in earnest, whether the other boat was aware of it or not. Robert is survived by his long-time companion, Elinor T. Fine of Connecticut and New York, his daughter, Sarah Winifred Wagenseil Jones, and three grandchildren Alyona Grace Jones, Pavel Henry Jones, and Anderson Pavel Jones, all of Mebane, North Carolina. Truly larger-than-life in every way, Robert was a uniquely talented and creative visionary with fearless opinions and an irreverent wit. He will be forever missed by those who loved and cherished him. In lieu of flowers, a donation may be made to Mystic Seaport, 75 Greenmanville Avenue, Mystic, CT, 06355.

Elsie's and Sam's passion for travel took them to more than 125 countries, an interest that Elsie continued to pursue after Sam's death in 1980. During her travels, Elsie amassed a collection of 350 dolls, favoring examples of local craftsmanship over what she called ""tourist dolls."" The couple contributed actively to their community as volunteers, lovers of the arts and philanthropists. A long history of support of Glen Cove Hospital most recently included funding for the Wunsch Center for Rehabilitative Therapies, an 8,200-square-foot inpatient rehabilitation and spa center. Elsie volunteered with the Glen Cove Hospital Auxiliary for more than 30 years, following Sam's treatment there in the 1970s. Even as she entered her 90s, Elsie's pink-smocked presence continued to lend assistance and comfort to countless patients and visitors. She was recognized as an exemplar of citizen volunteerism in a 2006 profile by The Daily News. Elsie was also active in teaching English as a Second Language in the Glen Cove School District, and contributed to the Glen Cove Council of the Arts, the Glen Cove Community Scholarship Fund, the Girl Scouts and local animal welfare causes. She attended, with enthusiasm, the Metropolitan Opera and the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts on Long Island. Elsie is survived by members of the Wunsch and Durando families.

And yet the unwavering A-game that he brings to his adenoidal American inflections every week, still supplies only the most meager reason to keep praising this former sketch comic. Portraying mental breakdowns rarely inspire economy in actors, but Mr. Laurie made real a whole universe of misery and disconnection in a simple series of dreamy, delusional expressions and gestures during House's drug-aggravated unraveling, proving that he is far more than a gifted satirist. Mr. Laurie isn't God -- his character's fierce atheism precludes any such deification -- but every Monday night he makes it unfathomable to imagine that he is anyone other than the broken, defended rationalist he so ingeniously plays."

2009-06-07T00:00:00Z,"CARRINGTON--James H. On June 1, 2009 CDR James H. ""Jim"" Carrington, 84, passed away peacefully at home in Atlantic Beach, FL surrounded by his beloved family. He was an accomplished athlete, educator and a successful businessman. Commander Carrington, a graduate of Phillips Academy, Andover and the U.S. Naval Academy class of 1948, was a six-time, three-sport All-American in football, swimming, and lacrosse, earning thirteen varsity letters at Fordham, Cornell, and Navy. He was a recipient of the Naval Academy Athletic Association Sword for Athletic Excellence and was inducted into the Naval Academy's Athletic Hall of Fame. During his 19 years of commissioned service, he served on the carrier USS Leyte CV-32, the USS Plymouth Rock LSD-29 and the USS Hanson DDR-832 which saw action in the Korean War. After his Navy career he earned a Ph.D. in Business Administration at The American University and joined its faculty as an Associate Professor. Two years later he became Director of Budget and Management at Georgetown University. His final academic assignment was at George Washington University where he taught small business administration, and wrote the business management text: Command, Control, and Compromise. For fifteen years, CDR Carrington was a nationally-ranked squash player, winning both the national hardball and softball championships and a World Masters doubles title. His passion for sports led him to coach teams from the grammar school to the NCAA level. Jim Carrington was a devoted husband, father and friend, as well as a learned counselor and a tenacious competitor. Above all, he was a good and just man who will remain a source of inspiration to his family and friends. Jim is survived by his loving wife, Kathleen Connell Carrington of Sea Girt, NJ, his five children: James H. H. Carrington, Jr. of Rome, Italy, Wendy Carrington of Southbury, CT, Timothy Carrington of Marietta, GA, Nancy Crown of Winnetka, IL, Kathleen Anderson of Greer, SC and ten grandchildren. He will be sorely missed. The Memorial Mass was held at St. John's Catholic Church in Atlantic Beach, FL on Saturday, June 6, 2009 at 11:00am.

2009-06-07T00:00:00Z,"ZOOM Imagine these two explanatory models. One model tells you: Hitler, Göring -- pick any highly placed Nazi -- liked these paintings because they saw themselves in them. The other model tells you that they wanted to enhance their stature by owning a work of one of the greatest Dutch masters, by owning a Vermeer. Of course, it could be both. When Göring says, ''I want that,'' what exactly is it that he wants? Does he want ''Christ and the Adulteress,'' the Vermeer? Or ''Christ and the Adulteress,'' the Nazi Vermeer? The Vermeer that is designed to appeal to him. If Jonathan Lopez's theory is right, then the van Meegeren Vermeers are possibly more attractive to Göring than a real Vermeer because he sees himself in them. Christ pardoning the adulteress.

A former It Girl, muse and mediocre actress, she had become best known for performing fellatio on Vincent Gallo in his lambasted directorial effort, ''The Brown Bunny.'' During the show's third season, though, Ms. Sevigny humanized Nicki to the point that she became its heartbreaking epicenter, a mother who sought and failed to find her voice and independence, a woman who had managed to spend her whole life neither loved nor desired. The layers of witchy armor seemed to evaporate, and in an ensemble cast in which talent reigns, Ms. Sevigny emerged as the real thing, the one to watch."

Mr. Bernstein was perhaps best known for two books he wrote at a stage in life when most people are retired: ""Against The Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk,"" and ""Capital Ideas: The Improbable Origins of Modern Wall Street."" As my colleague Louis Uchitelle noted in his affectionate obituary, Mr. Bernstein was a firm believer in the efficient market theory -- the subject of my column last Saturday -- and especially the power of diversification, which he touted constantly. He founded The Journal of Portfolio Theory. Harry Markowitz, who was awarded a Nobel Prize, for, essentially, creating portfolio theory, was one of his heroes. Mr. Bernstein's last book, ""Capital Ideas Evolving,"" published two years ago, was an attempt (more successful than not) at incorporating some of the ideas of behavioral finance into the broader efficient market theory championed by the likes of Mr. Markowitz and Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago."

2009-06-11T00:00:00Z,"AUSTIN--John, M.D.,64, Oakland, California resident. Died in an airplane accident on May 29, 2009. Dr. Austin was a pioneer in bringing high-quality health care services to rural communities. He was the founder, executive chairman and chief medical officer of Arcadian Management Services, an Oakland California-based provider of high-quality, cost-effective administrative infrastructure and management services to health care provider groups, hospitals and health plans. Since 2005, Arcadian Health Plan has continued to live his vision to provide health care needs of traditionally under-served members of rural communities, with 46,000 members in 11 states. As a young doctor, Dr. Austin worked in the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic in San Francisco and, later, helped develop Rockridge Clinic, one of the early community health plans in the Bay Area. He went on to serve other health care companies in executive roles for more than 20 years. Dr. Austin also was a dedicated conservationist. Most recently, he restored Boulder Creek Canyon Ranch in Utah to have the ranch placed under conservation easement; it now is preserved in perpetuity as an organic working ranch. Dr. Austin received his undergraduate degree and M.D. degree from the University of California in San Francisco, and his Masters in Public Health from Harvard University. Described as a ""Renaissance Man"" by friends, Dr. Austin excelled not only professionally, but also at most trades mechanic, carpenter, electrician and plumbing. He was well-read, and found the time to continue to read and learn, to accrue knowledge deeply and broadly. Dr. Austin is survived by his loving wife, Jacqui Smalley. A memorial service to honor Dr. Austin will be held on Saturday, June 13, 2009 from 1pm to 4pm at the Claremont Country Club, 5295 Broadway Terrace, Oakland, California.

Before he thinks about doing so again, his agent will try to wring a record signing bonus out of the Washington Nationals. The agent, Scott Boras, set the stage for that Wednesday, calling Strasburg a premium-level player, the kind who presents ''little to no risk'' to a team if it signs him to a big contract. Boras also said Strasburg's value should not be measured against other No. 1 draft picks but against players who have entered the league in other ways. Pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka, for example, was given a six-year, $52 million contract when he signed with the Boston Red Sox out of Japan before the 2007 season."

Mr. Hitchcock is never at a loss for snappy patter. On Saturday afternoon, he claimed that the last rock fest he attended was the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, where Jimi Hendrix played. “Things look almost exactly the same,” he claimed. But Hendrix, he noted, now plays on YouTube."

Most of its equipment was on tabletops, along with microphones and some percussion, and its songs floated up out of an electronic haze: samples and maybe synthesizer parts that looped and burbled, clinked and scraped, arpeggiated and whizzed upward, the makings of songs from its latest album “Merriweather Post Pavilion.” When enough of them are interlocked, band members started singing the handful of lyrics in each song, sometimes overlapping or staggering them for another layer of counterpoint. It seemed open-ended; when they were done, they just let the mix dissolve back into the electronic ooze and teased out a new collection of song parts."

Sales of hardware (consoles and handheld devices) dropped by 30 percent, while sales of software fell by 17 percent, to $449 million.

Sales also fell sharply in March and April. But the NPD Group noted that those drops might have causes other than recession.

But for May, NPD offered little other rationale for the trend."

2009-06-14T00:52:10Z,"MANCHESTER, Tenn. — Friday at Bonnaroo was dominated by New York City, from Dirty Projectors to the Beastie Boys. On Saturday, Tennessee took over. The Other Tent was full of Tennessee pickers, musicians with deep bluegrass roots, open ears and flying fingers. The Tony Rice Unit, led by the guitarist who has been a prime mover in new acoustic music, opened its set with “My Favorite Things,” and proceeded to alternate old Appalachian songs and excursions toward jazz. The Del McCoury Band clustered around one microphone, in old-time radio and recording style. Cherryholmes sparkled with rhinestones, but broke into group clog-dancing at the end of one song. These musicians could sound deeply traditional, or not at all, with each item in a setlist."
2009-06-14T09:14:32Z,"MANCHESTER, Tenn. — Someone came to Bonnaroo well prepared. Bruce Springsteen has been taking requests on his current tour from fans who bring handmade posters, and at Bonnaroo he got close enough to the crowd to collect them. Onstage, he unfurled a man-sized poster of Santa Claus, with a request for his version (which is modeled on Phil Spector’s production) of “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.” Sure, it’s June. But for Mr. Springsteen, it’s not too early to tell the little girls and boys to be good for goodness’ sake."

2009-06-14T13:43:54Z,"MANCHESTER, Tenn. — Sometime around 2 a.m., during a ferocious and meticulous set by his band, Nine Inch Nails, Trent Reznor made an announcement: that it would be “our last show ever in the United States.” The band is headed to Europe on tour. Mr. Reznor went on, “Don’t be sad. I’ll keep going. But I think I’m going to lose my” mind if “I keep doing this, and I have to stop.”"
2009-06-14T15:02:55Z,"BOSTON — At an early-music festival, you expect to see antique instruments: pegless cellos, gambas with ornate scrolls, wooden recorders and tranverse flutes of every size, and perhaps an occasional shawm, rebec or vielle. And you expect to see re-creations of ensembles that composers no longer write for (although a few composers seem to be gravitating toward the gamba now)."
2009-06-14T19:00:43Z,"President Barack Obama‘s half brother, George, is writing a memoir to be published by Simon & Schuster in January of next year , The Associated Press reported. Mr. Obama, who is 27 and lives in Huruma, Kenya, has the same father as the president. The two half brothers did not meet until they were adults. The book is tentatively titled “Homeland” and will be written with Damien Lewis, an author and journalist. George Obama fell into crime and poverty as a teenager, before finding a passion for community organizing. “Even had George Obama not been our President’s half brother, his story is moving and inspirational,” David Rosenthal, Simon & Schuster publisher and executive vice president, said in a statement Sunday. “It is an object lesson in survival, selflessness and courage.” The publisher would not reveal how much it paid for the book, but someone with knowledge of the negotiations said it was in the six figures."

There are some light-hearted options among the 12, but some would have some serious bite, even if at first glance they seem to be harmless. Forcing assistants off the recruiting trail or barring a team from holding summer football camps could do some serious damage to its recruiting. And could you imagine how quickly teams would fall in line if the N.C.A.A. started away taking home games, and the millions of dollars of revenue they provide for universities and their communities?"

Walking even 20 minutes is well worth it because you can only get a feeling for the grandeur and size of the canyon from down below the rim. A helicopter tour is no substitute; the visitor would completely miss out on the solitude and quiet of the canyon. Walking is free, and can easily be done from the South Rim; a gently graded trail starts just west of the Bright Angel Lodge, beside the Kolb Studio."

2009-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Many postindustrial cities have abandoned the notion of the waterfront as a place of commercial and social activity. This project would enable cities to re-establish this connection by emphasizing the intersection of three powerful aspects of urban life: infrastructure, public space and sustainability. Wheels installed at derelict piers or on permanently moored barges along the riverfront harvest energy, effectively converting kinetic energy to zero-carbon electrical energy. They do so by relying on the time-tested technology of undershot water wheels: the river’s current applies a force to the submerged blades of each wheel, and this force spins the wheels, which, in turn, drive electricalgenerators. The electricity produced is then used to illuminate a system of L.E.D. streetlights. Controllers sense when surplus electricity is available and divert it to the city’s electrical grid. At the same time, the wheels enliven the water’s edge and serve as a place for the public to gather, taking infrastructure and sustainability into the realm of celebration."

In 2011, a new privately owned high-speed train company, Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori, will introduce a stylish, candy-apple-red fleet of 25 trains collectively known as Italo. The trains' interiors will be designed by the Italian car designer Giorgetto Giugiaro. Called Automotrice Grande Vitesse (A.G.V.; an updated version of the French high-speed T.G.V.), Italo trains will provide service to locations between Naples and Turin. Company officials estimate that a trip from Rome to Milan, about 350 miles by rail, will last three hours and that trains will be able to travel up to speeds of 225 miles an hour. The billion-euro project, spearheaded by the head of Fiat and Ferrari, Luca di Montezemolo, includes investors like the French rail company S.N.C.F., and hopes to produce trains that are mostly constructed from recyclable materials and consume 15 percent less energy than current high-speed trains."

The crust may be light and thin, but it's not charred to blistering by a 900-degree wood-fired oven. The sauce, though tomato-sweet, is not made from prized San Marzano fruits. The cheese binds the pizza together well enough, but you'd never mistake it for mozzarella di bufala."

2009-06-14T00:00:00Z,"HAMMERSLEY--Frederick, abstract painter, born in 1919, died on May 31 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Hammersley gained international attention through the 1959 exhibition Four Abstract Classicists which was shown at the Los Angeles County Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, and Queen's University in Belfast, Ireland. The term ""hard edge"" was coined at the time to describe the geometric, abstract paintings by Hammersley, Karl Benjamin, Lorser Feitelson and John McLaughlin. Hammersley formed the edges of the shapes in his paintings with a palette knife, often adding unique, handmade frames and giving them titles with clever word plays, both of which he considered part of each work. During the 1940's Hammersley attended Chouinard and Jepson Art Schools and served in the U.S. Army in World War II. In 1946, he studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris where he met Picasso, Braque, and Brancusi. He later taught at Jepson, Pomona College, Chouinard, and the University of New Mexico until 1971 when he left teaching to devote himself full-time to painting. His best known works are oils on canvas comprised of ""hunch"" paintings, ""geometrics"", and ""organics"", however, he also took photographs, experimented with computer-generated art, and made prints and drawings throughout his life. Hammersley's paintings were included in the Museum of Modern Art's ""Responsive Eye"" exhibition in 1965 and in the 35th Corcoran Biennial in 1977. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1973. His works are in the collections of the Albright Knox Museum, Corcoran Gallery of Art, High Museum of Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Santa Barbara Museum of Art, The Albuquerque Museum, New Mexico Museum of Art, and the University of New Mexico Art Museum, among others. Over the past decade Hammersley enjoyed a renewed interest in his strictly modernist yet playfully intuitive hard-edge paintings, which were exhibited in Site Santa Fe's ""Fourth International Biennial"" in 2001, a retrospective at Pomona College Museum of Art in 2007, and Orange County Museum's ""Birth of the Cool: California Art, Design, and Culture at Mid-century"" in 2008. Hammersley is survived by his sister Susie H. Stone, of Santa Fe."

2009-06-14T00:00:00Z,"HAPPY DAYS I had been lucky enough in my 20s to stumble into the life I might have dreamed of as a boy: a great job writing on world affairs for Time magazine, an apartment on Park Avenue, enough time and money to take vacations in Burma, Morocco, El Salvador. But every time I went to one of those places, I noticed that the people I met there, mired in difficulty and often warfare, seemed to have more energy and even optimism than the friends I'd grown up with in privileged, peaceful Santa Barbara, Calif., many of whom were on their fourth marriages and seeing a therapist every day. Though I knew that poverty certainly didn't buy happiness, I wasn't convinced that money did either. So, as post-1960s cliché decreed, I left my comfortable job and life to live for a year in a temple on the back streets of Kyoto. My high-minded year lasted all of a week, by which time I'd noticed that the depthless contemplation of the moon and composition of haiku I'd imagined from afar was really more a matter of cleaning, sweeping and then cleaning some more. But today, more than 21 years later, I still live in the vicinity of Kyoto, in a two-room apartment that makes my old monastic cell look almost luxurious. I have no bicycle, no car, no television I can understand, no media -- and the days seem to stretch into eternities, and I can't think of a single thing I lack."

2009-06-14T00:00:00Z,"WUNSCH--Elsie, nee Rubin, 97, of Glen Cove, NY died peacefully at Glen Cove Hospital on June 5, 2009. Elsie was born on June 23, 1911 in Manhattan and attended Columbia University. She married her beloved Samuel, a mechanical engineer, in 1934. The couple built a home (which they named Elsam) overlooking Long Island Sound on East Island in Glen Cove, moving in on V-J Day in 1945, and spent their lives there. Elsie's and Sam's passion for travel took them to more than 125 countries, an interest that Elsie continued to pursue after Sam's death in 1980. During her travels, Elsie amassed a collection of 350 dolls, favoring examples of local craftsmanship over what she called ""tourist dolls."" The couple contributed actively to their community as volunteers, lovers of the arts and philanthropists. A long history of support of Glen Cove Hospital most recently included funding for the Wunsch Center for Rehabilitative Therapies, an 8,200-square-foot inpatient rehabilitation and spa center. Elsie volunteered with the Glen Cove Hospital Auxiliary for more than 30 years, following Sam's treatment there in the 1970s. Even as she entered her 90s, Elsie's pink-smocked presence continued to lend assistance and comfort to countless patients and visitors. She was recognized as an exemplar of citizen volunteerism in a 2006 profile by The Daily News. Elsie was also active in teaching English as a Second Language in the Glen Cove School District, and contributed to the Glen Cove Council of the Arts, the Glen Cove Community Scholarship Fund, the Girl Scouts and local animal welfare causes. She attended, with enthusiasm, the Metropolitan Opera and the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts on Long Island. Elsie is survived by members of the Wunsch and Durando families. A tiny woman who possessed an encyclopaedic memory and told a good joke, she will be lovingly remembered and missed by all whose lives she touched. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, June 20, from noon-2:30pm. Beginning on Monday, June 8, please call 212-889-8790 for information. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Glen Cove Community Scholarship Fund, P.O. Box 453, Glen Cove, NY 11542."

2009-06-15T12:20:58Z,"A sculpture intended to celebrate the European Union but that offended several of its member countries is on display uncensored in Prague, Agence France-Presse reported. The sculpture, called Entropa, was commissioned to mark the start of the Czech Republic’s six-month presidency of the European Union. Each of its interlocking segments was supposed to celebrate the union’s 27 member nations but instead offered satirical depictions: Italy was represented with a soccer field; Romania was shown as a Count Dracula theme park; a series of toilets stood in for Bulgaria. (The toilets were covered up after a protest by the Bulgarian permanent representative to the European Union.) Each piece of the sculpture was to be produced by a different artist, but Entropa was later revealed to be the work of the Czech sculptor David Cerny and two friends. At an unveiling at a private gallery on Thursday, Vaclav Havel, the former Czech president, said jokingly that the sculpture had been made by him and Jiri Paroubek, a Czech politician who initiated a no-confidence vote against the government in March."
2009-06-15T12:56:50Z,"MANCHESTER, Tenn. — Erykah Badu came onstage about as incognito as a headliner could, wearing a hoodie (Public Enemy logo) with shades over artfully ripped and paint-spattered blue jeans. At one point, she even had a hat on top of the hoodie. But even before she showed her face, her songs were tell-alls: about her age, her babies, her gap between albums, her body, her first romance, with each revelation drawing approving oohs from women in the audience. Her band played serenely undulating vamps as Ms. Badu sang, rhymed and scat-sang what might have been a stream-of-consciousness autobiography. But it wasn’t; her backup singers, both rehearsed and attentive, underlined selected phrases with neat harmonies, proof that Ms. Badu had her story all planned out.Merle Haggard‘s anti-hippie broadside from 1969, “Okie from Muskogee,” is his signature song; his band plays it for his entrance and exit onstage. By now, he’s played it in all sorts of places. But there was still a little piquancy to see him sing “We don’t smoke marijuana in Muskogee/We don’t take our trips on LSD” to a tie-dyed crowd with, shall we say, a different lifestyle. And while it was drinking songs and Johnny Cash hits that got the crowd whooping loudest, Mr. Haggard also set out his down-to-earth populism, starting his set with a trenchant song about debt: “A Working Man Can’t Get Nowhere Today.”"
2009-06-15T15:09:34Z,"MANCHESTER, Tenn. — Snoop Dogg turned Bonnaroo’s hippie party into a “gangsta party,” all about sex, drugs and cash. Taken as anything but an X-rated cartoon, his songs are virtually nonstop sleaze, detailing a life of arrogant excess and giving explicit instructions to an endless supply of willing women. (It’s impressive that he has come up with enough variations to sustain a career since 1993.) The bounce of the music and his nonchalant delivery combine to come across as amiable, and his set on Bonnaroo’s largest stage drew a crowd ready to sing along and raise a middle finger in the air on cue. The biggest smiles and loudest singalongs came from “the ladies” for whom he usually uses a different word."
2009-06-15T18:00:48Z,"Having scared the pants off us with his film adaptation of “The Silence of the Lambs,” the director Jonathan Demme has decided to turn his attention to something truly frightening: directing for the theater.

2009-06-15T15:55:14Z,"MANCHESTER, Tenn. — Phish’s Sunday-night sets, closing out Bonnaroo, were the kind that drive jam-band haters crazy. The setlist was mostly light-hearted, two-chord and three-chord songs, unlike Friday’s set, which had a higher proportion of Phish’s more elaborate compositions. And there’s nothing like a long two-chord vamp to tempt a jam band into noodling territory. But Phish didn’t succumb; the songs were varied ones, like the swaggering “Bathtub Gin” (with Page McConnell pounding free-jazz clusters and glissandos on piano) and the bluesy “Character Zero.” And Trey Anastasio — no doubt aware of Bruce Springsteen in the wings — aimed for ascending, guitar-hero solos that the band could push into crescendo after crescendo. (The crowd did a mass glowstick toss at each crest.) Near the end of the second set, in “Farmhouse,” concentration did give way to noodling, though Phish played on, eventually shaping up for encores. Maybe it was Bonnaroo fatigue setting in."
2009-06-15T17:00:39Z,"MANCHESTER, Tenn. — Is Bonnaroo too retro? It does rely on touring veterans and longtime favorites, threatening to turn it into an oldies extravaganza — though they’re good oldies like “Born to Run” and Public Enemy’s full-length performance of the 1988 album “It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back” (one that I unfortunately missed)."

This year the U.S.G.A. has made some modifications to the Black Course. Many of the fairways are wider, many tee locations are new, the greens are likely to be faster and a graduated rough will be used. The course will also play 212 yards longer than in 2002. The U.S.G.A. has made these changes to introduce more risk-reward options for players, rewarding them for well-played strokes and penalizing them for bad shots. The following holes highlight some of the changes from 2002. 10 - In 2002, some players had difficulty reaching the fairway. To ensure this doesn't happen again, it has been brought closer to the tee by about 35 yards. Another change is a closely mowed area created behind the green to allow balls to roll out and give players more short-game options on their recovery shots."

2009-06-16T11:35:19Z,"Whether you believe the animated series “South Park” is crude and obnoxious or a cleverly pointed satire (or possibly both), there is at least one court in Russia that says the show does not provoke religious hatred. The Moscow Times reported Tuesday that on June 2, Moscow’s Basmanny district court canceled a warning it had issued to the Russian television channel 2×2, which broadcasts “South Park,” after complaints by a religious group that said the show was insulting to religiously observant viewers. The group, the Union of Evangelical Christians, was specifically objecting to an episode titled “Mr. Hankey’s Christmas Classics,” a compilation of bawdy parodies of Christmas carols. In September, Russian prosecutors issued an official warning to 2×2, saying that a panel of experts had determined that the episode promoted “hatred between religions,” according to The Moscow Times. Prosecutors had also warned 2×2 in connection with the animated series “Family Guy” and “The Simpsons.” In response, the channel pulled several episodes of both shows but continued to broadcast each series."

Mr. Rogers, who won the Pritzker Prize in 2007, had been working on plans for 552 new homes to be built on the site of a former army barracks in London’s Chelsea district. The project was being managed by a division of Qatari Diar, the property investment arm of the Qatar emirate. But last week, Qatar withdrew its planning application for Mr. Rogers’s design after Prince Charles wrote to Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, the prime minister of Qatar. According to The Guardian, the prince wrote that Mr. Rogers’s designs were “unsuitable” for a site so close to the Royal Hospital designed by Christopher Wren. The Prince’s Foundation for the Built Environment, a charity that Prince Charles oversees as president, has been appointed to help produce a new design for the project."
