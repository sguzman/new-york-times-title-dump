1989-09-17T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Mixed media in the theater can be a mixed blessing. In ''Anulah, Let Them Eat Cake'' at the Theater for the New City, the music of Tonny Prabowo and Mickele Navazio is as light and loony as most of the dialogue, giving this little play the air of comic opera.

1989-09-23T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Secretary Jack Kemp's outline of proposed reforms for the Department of Housing and Urban Development seems well conceived, as far as it goes. It deserves careful scrutiny by Congress. But one of the chief failures uncovered in the H.U.D. scandals was of Congressional oversight. Congress also needs to scrutinize itself."
1989-09-23T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The stock of Cummins Engine Company Inc. tumbled $5.125 today, to $57.50, on the New York Stock Exchange, and analysts attributed the drop to a negative earnings estimate issued late Thursday by the Columbus, Ind., manufacturer of diesel engines and automotive parts."

1989-09-23T00:00:00Z,LEAD: People who jog or bicycle to work may want to consider an alternative: roller skating. Modern technology has refashioned the old metal skate into a lighter plastic model that snaps over a shoe.
1989-09-23T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: There is an alternative to the videocassette recorder: the Laservision video disk player. LV's provide better pictures and sound than do VCR's, the disks never wear out and most of the new machines also play compact disks. The disadvantages are that most stores offer movie disks for sale only and not for rental (they generally cost about $25 to $35) and that you cannot record on disks."
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,LEAD: Island Paradise

1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Richard Lederer's entertaining column ''Haunted Words'' (On Language, Sept. 3) fails to mention one hardy perennial among bogus word derivations: the one that traces tip, in the sense of gratuity, to the phrase ''to insure promptness.'' Actually, there's no acronym involved; the word simply reflects the fact that 18th-century pub habitues used to ''tip'' (i.e., tap) a coin on the counter when it came time to settle up with the gentleman in the apron."
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Goethe once described architecture as frozen music; if he was right, could cities be described as congealed concertos? Maybe this is stretching an already flimsy metaphor, but music, architecture and cities do share one striking characteristic. Just as agreeable music requires both solo and ensemble playing, and great architecture needs expanses of serenity to provide the setting for moments of soaring drama so, too, successful cities demand an underlying melody."
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: HOW do you boss around a friend? Not easily, say the experts. Yet increasing numbers of companies routinely promote employees from within, without realizing that new managers and supervisors need some special training in order to deal with former peers successfully, said Robert M. Steed, whose business is developing training programs for corporate clients."
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: I plead guilty to only one of the several indictments Howard Berridge charges me with (Letters to the New Jersey Editor, Aug. 20). After reading Mr. Berridge's letter, I went back to my own and, scrutinizing it from his point of view, I found that my ''foolish frenzy'' seems in retrospect to be a bit of a wild pitch."

1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: NONFICTION PARSON'S MILL. By Timothy Lewontin. (University Press of New England, $14.95.) A delightful, surprisingly absorbing account of a year's labor in a New Hampshire sawmill, ''Parson's Mill'' approaches the gung-ho participatory journalism that George Plimpton performed in his athletic days."
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Sandwiched onto the Canisius College campus, between a subway stop and the basketball arena, is a new $4 million athletic field where next Saturday the college's football team will play its first game on campus."

1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: ONE morning last month in a rehearsal studio on the campus of Princeton University, a playwright, a couple of actors and a director were sitting around, talking about a scene. It concerned a retired, widowed teacher on the brink of suicide. His colleague and best friend, a homosexual, tries to talk him out of it, and offers to move in with him."
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The San Francisco Opera's new production of Alban Berg's ''Lulu'' counts as Lotfi Mansouri's 42d with the company, but his first since he became its new general director. When he was appointed to the job, he indicated that he would play down stage direction and concentrate on administration. Given the disappointing flatness of this ''Lulu,'' seen"
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: PLAYERS collect $200 each time they pass ''Go.'' They pay rent when they land on their opponents' property, and they go to jail - directly to jail - when they roll three doubles in a row. But instead of Boardwalk and Park Place, there are local businesses like Coldwell Banker and Travel Desk in Greenwich; Rip Van Winkle Lanes and the Norwalk Bank in Norwalk, and Top Drawer and Sound Rigging Services in Essex."
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,LEAD: To the Sports Editor:
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Considering Hollywood's preference for escapism, it is surprising to see the cameras turning on a spate of strong, controversial movies about racial conflict. ''Do the Right Thing'' and ''Mississippi Burning'' have drawn large audiences as well as reams of divided critical commentary, and more stories about racial prejudice are to hit the theaters during the next year."
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,LEAD: RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI began last week to put together the pieces of a Republican Party shattered even more than usual by a bruising primary battle.
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: SURELY this can't be me at 7:39 on a Monday morning, panting after a mad dash through closing doors amid a crowd of suits and briefcases and Wall Street Journals. Shouldn't I be in bed at this time, with no pressure to rise for at least another 15 minutes? But that was before I became . . . Commuting"

1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Your article [ ''Waiting for a Nursing-Home Bed,'' Aug. 13 ] on the problems for the elderly and their families inherent in waiting for nursing-home placement is right on target. It properly describes the pain and feelngs of displacement that waiting for available nursing-home beds engenders. The requirement that anyone needing such placement must accept the first available nursing-home bed available within a 50-mile radius can and sometimes does cause serious problems."
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,LEAD: THE clock on my living-room wall is one of my favorite things. It is a chime clock from Germany bought in 1971 from an elderly jeweler who lived with his wife in my hometown.

1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: God forbid, you criticize a Spike Lee film or scoff at a tirade by the Rev. Al Sharpton. ''Racist'' is the charge. Anthony Walton's paranoid article continues on the same track. Notre Dame and Brown notwithstanding, a temporary doorman refuses to let him pass. What's the big deal? Who gets a cab in the rain in New York City anyway?"
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: ''Food is good to think,'' Claude Levi-Strauss has said, and it is certainly good to read. American commercial publishers who once thought of cookbooks as strictly ''How-to'' now embed recipes in costly illustrated works that dramatize the rise of food from kitchen to library, where readers who never lifted pot or pan whet their chops each season over cookbooks, reading them as travel literature, social comedy, utopian fantasy, pastoral romance."
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Here are existing or planned operations of United Nations peacekeeping forces and observers.

1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: In the early 1970's you could have bet good money that Chris Burden would not be having a museum retrospective in the late 1980's.

1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,LEAD: THE 1989 school board budgets are history. The pros and cons have been hashed and rehashed. The anti-tax groups have been heaped with calumny. They have been called demagogues for daring to suggest that schools are not akin to motherhood.

1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Since major sports rankings are ultimately determined by win-loss records at season's end and since man cannot absolutely predict the future, then pre- and midseason rankings are fictions. But they are meaningful fictions. Without polls, college sports interest would be localized to Ann Arbor, Austin or Lexington."
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Shirley Stevens, the benefits coordinator at the Westin Hotel in Boston, and Otto F.

1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: If enthusiasm were all it took, most shows would be hits and ''Goree,'' a homily about self-discovery told primarily through African song and dance, would be a smash."
1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: A listing of college football schedules on Aug. 27 incorrectly listed Boston University's games.

1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Arjune, by yet another name, was back out of sight last week. Mr. Arjune, who went into the Federal Witness Protection Program last year after his battle with New York City crack dealers led to the murder of a police officer guarding his home, turned up in Spokane, Wash., recently.

1989-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: How much simpler this country would be if it had stalled out at 13 states. Most of the complicated mountains, climates and ethnic cultures would lie west of the border, as would all of the intimidating plains and deserts.

In a board room, an absent film executive dominates his employees by means of a giant screen. In her solitary apartment, a spooky, lovelorn woman makes her VCR the centerpiece of a shrine. An ambitious actor says one thing while beside him, on a monitor playing his audition tape, he is seen and heard saying something else. In a very modern mausoleum, a woman mournfully watches the deceased on videotape. The characters in Mr. Egoyan's earlier ''Family Viewing,'' shown as part of the New Directors/New Films series in 1987, also allowed their thoughts of love and sex and death to be shaped by ever-present video technology. But since then, without sacrificing his formidable pretensions, Mr. Egoyan has developed a much more engaging style.

The core of the 90-minute movie, which will be shown at Alice Tully Hall tonight at 7 P.M. and which begins its commercial run on Sunday at the 57th Street Playhouse, is taken from 14 hours of black-and-white film shot in the late 1960's by Michael and Christian Blackwood for a cinema verite television special about Monk.

All are united by a deliberately short-sighted pragmatism that almost succeeds in making tragedy matter of fact."

Fred Marx's ''Dreams From China'' and Ralph Arlyck's ''Current Events,'' the first-person films that will be shown at the New York Film Festival tonight at 6:30, show traces of both problems.

1989-10-07T00:00:00Z,"''Dancing for Mr. B: Six Balanchine Ballerinas'' is as graceful, taut and fiercely controlled as the dancers who are its subjects. In the opening scene, Darci Kistler - at 25 years of age the youngest of them - recalls that as an adolescent she read that Balanchine selected a perfume for each of his dancers. ''I thought it was wonderful that there was a man who cared that much,'' she says, setting the tone for Anne Belle's and Deborah Dickson's documentary. This is not a study of the great choreographer and the guiding spirit behind the New York City Ballet, but a portrait of women who feel privileged to have been shaped by him. Balanchine formed everything from the trajectory of their careers to the elongation of the leg muscles that helped create his dancers' characteristic lithe bodies. And though he died in 1983, at the age of 79, he hovers over this film like some omnipotent ghost, still choreographing his dancers' responses, still hindering any impulse to chafe against his control."

''Your lungs aren't going to get better, and so the act of putting you on the machine is almost a futile effort.'' In a long conversation, the nurse lets this patient know what his options are and tries to determine his wishes, as kindly as possible but with the suggestion that she has done this many times before. ''I want to help you, but I only want to help you in the manner in which you want to be helped,'' she says. ''I don't want to keep you alive unless you like living.'' A half-dozen young medical professionals gather around the bed of an old woman, a stroke victim who cannot speak and can communicate only by means of the faintest movements. They want to discuss the possibility of removing her breathing tube and the machine to which it is connected. Does she understand what the consequences of this may be? Is she prepared for the worst? Is she worried about the way her death may affect her devoted husband? The woman attempts to answer this barrage of difficult questions by weakly signaling yes or no, but she is soon exhausted.

In 1939 he was named artist-in-residence at the University of Wisconsin, the first musician in any American university to be so honored. He settled in.
