2006-09-09T00:00:00Z,"SCUDDER--Rogers V. 93, of Groton. Rogers V. Scudder Teacher, Scholar, Author. Rogers V. Scudder, a beloved and renowned teacher of Latin, died on Sunday, August 27, 2006. He was 93 years old and lived in Groton, Massachusetts. Born in St. Louis in 1912, Mr. Scudder attended St. Louis Country Day School. He graduated magna cum laude in Comparative Literature from Harvard University in1934, earned a Diploma in Classical Archaeology at Oxford in 1955, and a masters degree from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1958. MR. Scudder joined the American Field Service during World War II, and was an ambulance driver for part of that time. He served in the British Eighth Army for two years in Syria, North Africa and Italy. Mr. Scudder began his long and distinguished teaching career at the Roxbury Latin School in 1934 as an apprentice. Later, after a few years of teaching at Los Alamos School in New Mexico, he joined the faculty at Brooks School in 1936 where he taught until 1966. He joined the Groton School faculty in the spring of 1968 and continued to teach and then tutor until 2005. In the 1960s, he began his collaboration with Charles Jenney, Jr., on a fourVolume series of textbooks, which would become the most widely used Latin textbooks in the United States for nearly two decades. Mr. Scudder also served as The director of the Library at the American Academy in Rome from 1976-1983, overseeing its splendid collection in the fields of classical studies and the fine arts of the Italian Renaissance. An admired teacher and dormitory master, Mr. Scudder was known for his quick wit, which earned him legions of devoted students. When he arrived back from Rome to Groton School in 1984, he wrote: ''I return now to teach full time, a rather presumptuous undertaking for one of my advanced years.'' He continued to teach for another 20 years, generously sharing his wisdom, time and resources. So revered was he by the student body that the snack bar in the Student Center was named ''Scudder's'' in his honor. A memorial service will be held at St. John's Chapel at groton School on Sunday, September 24, at 1:00 p.m. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in his memory to a faVorite charity or institution."

On Aug. 16, when Ms. Weiss wrote a scathing review of the eight musicals at Stages 2006, a festival of shows in development presented by Theater Building Chicago, Mr. Weidman wrote to The Sun-Times condemning her for reviewing works in progress.

He apologized for the error, saying he was given false information, but added that Ms. Weiss's coverage still remained ''irresponsible and unprofessional.''

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,The Op-Ed page asked 10 experts to answer the following question: What is one major reason the United States has not suffered a major attack since 2001?
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"AS a result of the horror of Sept. 11, 2001, President Bush has transformed the way we fight terrorism and the tools we use. We successfully attack those very things our enemies need to operate and survive: leadership, communications, the ability to travel, weapons; foot soldiers and financing. The president has strengthened and transformed the intelligence community, integrated our military and intelligence assets, and broken down the barriers that kept domestic law enforcement and intelligence agencies from sharing information."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,THE best news in our struggle against terrorism is that we have not been hit at home since the 9/11 attacks. Yet terrorists are patient. We remain a target and must expect another attack.
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"THE reason we have not been attacked on American soil is that the war started by radical Muslims is not against the United States, but against everyone who does not conform to their beliefs and way of life. It is the first global war we have experienced since globalization became a factor in our life, and the terrorist battlefield has included Madrid, London, Bali, Moscow, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and India. The terrorists have had a very busy five years."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"S O why haven’t we been attacked in five years? Terrorists — especially those directed by or affiliated with Al Qaeda — are committed to carrying out spectacular attacks that maximize death, injury, economic damage and political symbolism. If their aim were merely to blow up the odd bus or to level a supermarket, doing so would be a very short order. But, the more spectacular the scale of a plot, the longer it takes to plan, the costlier it is to finance, the more operatives you need to carry it out, and the greater the chance that something will go awry."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"THOUGH it may not be immediately apparent to the casual viewer, Al Qaeda is attacking when and where it chooses. It is an ideology-driven global insurgency on the march. It has not hit America because it has chosen not to. Whether it lacks on-the-ground capacity for a spectacular attack, is still in the planning stages or is busy elsewhere is under debate within our intelligence community. The point is that five years out, Al Qaeda is as dangerous as, if not more than, it was on 9/11."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"O FFENSIVE action abroad has protected the homeland. Our military presence in Afghanistan and our aggressive policies around the globe have seriously disrupted the enemy. Through a mix of military and paramilitary action, pre-emptive strikes, deterrent threats and surveillance we have captured many terrorist leaders, destroyed training camps and structures of communication and control, and uncovered valuable intelligence troves."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"ANOTHER attempt on the scale of the 2001 attacks hasn’t been necessary. The last one is still doing the trick, and the terrorists’ resources are limited. The fear induced by terrorism mirrors the irrational psychology that makes state lotteries an utterly reliable form of stupidity tax. A huge statistical asymmetry serves as fulcrum for a spectral yet powerful lever: apprehension of the next jackpot. We’re terrorized not by the actual explosion, which statistically we’re almost never present for, but by our apprehension of the next one."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,THE most important counterterrorism activity since the fall of the Taliban has been the close cooperation of the C.I.A. with foreign intelligence services.
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"THE 9/11 attacks were a defining moment for the course of world politics and a strategic assault against the world’s leading power at the beginning of the 21st century. But the question is, were the terrorists successful? The answer is mixed. In the aftermath of 9/11, the world was united with America. Even in Arab and Muslim countries, the sense of shock and feelings of solidarity with America far outweighed any sympathies with the terrorists."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"SINCE 9/11, terrorism has increased significantly around the globe, but the United States has been spared. Eurasia rather than America has been the main source and victim. Why?."

In the Alou family, that ranks him second to his father, Felipe, who ended his career with 2,101 hits, and ahead of his uncles Matty (1,777) and Jesús (1,216). Streaks to Watch Ichiro Suzuki of Seattle, with 187 hits, and Michael Young of Texas, with 189, are trying to keep their streaks of consecutive 200-hit seasons alive. Suzuki has done it five straight seasons and Young three. Todd Helton of Colorado, who is hitting .302, is trying for his ninth consecutive season with at least a .300 average. Closing In on Record Trevor Hoffman of the Padres, above, is five saves from tying Lee Smith's career record of 478. Last month, Hoffman did not allow a run and converted all seven of his save opportunities. San Diego is scheduled to play 15 of its remaining 21 games on the road. Extra Bases With three hits Friday night, including a double and a triple, Grady Sizemore of the Indians became the fifth player since 1900 with at least 50 doubles, 10 triples and 20 home runs in the same season. THE WATCH LIST With Ben Broussard traded to Seattle, Ryan Garko figured to be the Indians' first baseman next season. But Kevin Kouzmanoff, below, hit .379 with 22 home runs in Class AA and Class AAA this season to earn a promotion this month. He hit a grand slam in his first big-league at-bat and homered the next day. Three terrible starts at Class AAA Norfolk last season might have proved to the Mets that Yusmeiro Petit's phenomenal statistics in the low minors did not match the reality of his ability. The Marlins are learning that the hard way. Petit turned in a mediocre season at Class AAA Albuquerque, and in 12 major league games, mostly in relief, he has an earned run average over 8.00. The left-hander JOSH OUTMAN, one of the pitching prospects who led Lakewood into the Class A South Atlantic League playoffs, could not earn a call-up after compiling a 7-1 record and a 1.93 E.R.A. in his past 10 starts. But if he ever does join the Phillies, he will have the best name of any pitcher in the majors. Statistics through Friday. Sources: MLB.com, STATS LLC"

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"DUMPED into theaters as an exploitation cheapie in 1968, this lyrical thriller is a minor American classic. As Dennis, a young man trying to get his feet on the ground after being released from a reformatory, Anthony Perkins, right, gives perhaps his richest performance, certainly his most touching. Just as Perkins was trying to leave behind the juvenile roles that had typecast him, Dennis, a basically decent fellow, is trying to become an adult. But even when he succeeds in hiding his past, he can't resist playing the smart aleck or slipping into a world of make-believe. Dennis persuades the town golden girl Sue Ann (Tuesday Weld, right) to slip into that world with him. The twist is that she's every bit the psychopath people assume Dennis is. And since she's bored with the small town and hates her mother, she's ready for anything. Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s screenplay is beautifully worked out, and the director, Noel Black, does a superb job of modulating the film's conflicting elements: the coming-of-age story and the thriller. Sensitive and unsettling, ''Pretty Poison'' at times suggests a smaller-scale version of ''Splendor in the Grass,'' without the Freudian gush. And when violence breaks out in the suburban setting, Mr. Black plays it straight, not for the cheap irony that won so much praise for Terrence Malick's phony, condescending ''Badlands.''"

Curt Schilling, also with 14 victories, was supposed to pitch but did not because of an ailing shoulder.

Ellis's phantasmagorical tale is narrated by a writer -- named Bret Easton Ellis -- whose first novel, ''Less Than Zero,'' made him a literary celebrity in the 1980's. Leaving behind the shallow glitter of Manhattan, Bret strikes out for the suburbs, marries the movie-star mother of his son and plods through a teaching job at a local college. But bourgeois malaise turns to terror when Bret is stalked by the ghost of his alcoholic father and by his infamous creation, the deranged Patrick Bateman of ''American Psycho.'' In the Book Review, A. O. Scott called ''Lunar Park'' a ''tale of wild chemical and sexual excess'' that is ''shot through with longing.''"
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"G. W. PABST'S tragic fable, from two plays by Frank Wedekind about a prostitute whose love for -- and conquest of -- a married man begins her spiral of decline, is one of the most beautifully filmed of all silent movies. Pabst's unobtrusive but masterly compositions and disarmingly delicate lighting effects are the stuff of rapture. Then again, when Louise Brooks, above, is your star, it's your duty to place her in a context of perfection. Brooks plays the doomed, exquisite Lulu, who, with her sable bob and mischievous, calculating smile, became an enduring symbol of jazz-age freedom and joyousness. If beauty and saucy charm were all Brooks had to offer, she would have ended up a caricature. But this performance is so vital and so infinitely shaded that it inspires wonder each time you see it. Brooks's Lulu is an image of relaxed modernity: she may be willful, petulant and manipulative, but she is also a woman striding toward an uncertain future in a world that doesn't provide easy comforts."

Kristof (column, Sept. 5), lays bare an appalling and systematic attack on our public lands and reveals that President Bush's failure to continue a bipartisan tradition to protect the American wilderness is no oversight. Although fear for the future is both understandable and warranted, it is too early to mourn for our wild lands. Rather than grieve, concerned citizens can join the burgeoning counterattack in their defense."

Thus, on the vote of a few residents of the hegemonic planet Earth, Pluto -- a celestial body whose only crime was to dare to wander in orbit to the beat of a different drummer -- was stripped of its 76-year-old classification. Pluto is now officially downgraded to a new category called dwarf planet, and all textbooks in all languages are ordered to refer to it with that adjectival derogation. World media, except a few unscientific sentimentalists (and the fictional Lois Lane's Daily Planet) are meekly complying."

September NEW YORK MUSICAL THEATER FESTIVAL A version of a Greek tragedy for the preschool set (''Oedipus for Kids,'' with songs like ''A Little Complex'' -- get it?) and a musical look at the Kitty Genovese murder are only two of the more than 30 full productions of new musicals that this ambitious festival will present. Opens today. Through Oct. 1. Various locations. TheaterMania; nymf.org. THE TREATMENT Eve Ensler, who explored the female anatomy in ''The Vagina Monologues'' and ''The Good Body,'' is likely to explore the politics of torture with the same intimacy and anger. The actors Dylan McDermott and Portia play a traumatized military interrogator and the military psychologist assigned to conduct his therapy. Leigh Silverman directs. In previews. Opens Tuesday.

THE BIRTHDAY PARTY Emily Mann, the artistic director of the McCarter Theater, revives Harold Pinter's first full-length play, set in a seaside boardinghouse, with Allan Corduner, a Mike Leigh regular. Poor Stanley, an irritable concert pianist, can't escape Mr. Pinter's menacing hoods, however hard he tries.

The play was a success when it was presented in 1919 in New York by the young Theater Guild. With this production the Mint begins a three-year celebration of the renowned guild. In previews.

Endlessly touring the universe since its 1975 premiere at the Public Theater, ''A Chorus Line'' is returning to Broadway. Has it really been more than a decade and a half since it closed in 1990? It's old-home week for many on the production team: the director, Bob Avian, choreographed the original show with Michael Bennett, who directed; Baayork Lee, who will restage the original choreography, originated the role of Connie in that first production; Theoni V. Aldredge will be tweaking her original costume designs; and the set designer, Robin Wagner, is back for an encore. Of the writers, expect only the composer, Marvin Hamlisch, at the opening-night party. Michael Bennett died in 1987, as did the show's lyricist, Edward Kleban. The book's two authors, James Kirkwood and Nicholas Dante, died in 1989 and 1991. This time Charlotte d'Amboise is Cassie and Michael Berresse is Zach. Previews begin Sept. 18. Opens Oct. 5.

The ventriloquist Jay Johnson turned the cheery Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy trope on its head when he played the disturbing Chuck-and-Bob in Susan Harris's groundbreaking television comedy ''Soap.'' This solo show, which had its premiere in 2004 at the Atlantic Theater, will probably be just as disturbingly funny. Created by Mr. Johnson, Murphy Cross and Paul Kreppel and directed by Ms. Cross and Mr. Kreppel. Previews begin Sept. 19. Opens Sept. 28. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, Manhattan. Telecharge, TheaterMania. NIXON'S NIXON The MCC Theater brings back Russell Lees's political satire for the 10th anniversary of the play's world premiere. Gerry Bamman and Steve Mellor recreate the roles of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in this imagined late-night conversation between the two men in which they try to fix their places in history.

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I was thrilled to see Rachel Donadio's essay about artists' colonies (''What I Did at Summer Writers' Camp,'' Aug. 20), but I wish she had dug a little below the commonly accepted vision of what sort of writer goes to an artists' colony and spoken to a lesser-known, more racially diverse group of former colonists. Unlike the wonderful writers she quoted (some of whom I'm acquainted with, all of whom I respect), I am not white, best-selling or a Pulitzer Prize winner. I am a three-time MacDowell fellow, a married African-American mother of two school-age children and a published novelist. The first time I went to MacDowell, I was seven months pregnant with my now 8-year-old daughter (no sex then, I'll tell ya). I worked on my most recent book, ''Third Girl From the Left,'' during two separate subsequent MacDowell stays. MacDowell (which, in the interest of full disclosure, I must admit I love so much that I volunteer as the president of the fellows executive committee), and the other artists' colonies mentioned, do much to foster the cultural life of this country, not just by providing an incubator for the better known but by providing an incubator for talented creative artists whether they are prominent or not, white or not. Sure, there are romances, high jinks and intrigues -- but as Michael Chabon points out, ''there's no substitute'' for a beautiful, caring place to work like a colony. Martha Southgate Brooklyn To the Editor: I wonder where Rachel Donadio heard the saying that ''the sex is better at Yaddo, but the work is better at MacDowell''? In 1949 I was invited to play violin in a summer festival of American contemporary music at Yaddo, where Dean Dixon led an orchestra consisting mostly of first-desk symphonic musicians, conservatory teachers and top professional freelancers. Distinguished composers attended in order to revise their latest compositions, which we played from manuscript, and they made up a Who's Who in American music: Charles Ives, Henry Cowell, David Diamond and others. And then there was undistinguished me: an 18-year-old Juilliard student who, to this day, cannot imagine why I was chosen for this Yaddo honor. I was probably one of the youngest ''artists'' ever to be invited to Yaddo, and my professional orchestra experience had been limited to the Juilliard training ensemble and summer concerts in Catskills hotels where, incidentally, the sex was probably better (and surely more prolific) than at Yaddo and MacDowell put together. I know nothing of the sexual scene in the MacDowell colony, and whether the creative output of its resident artists is superior to Yaddo's is debatable. But I can attest, as a curious teenager in 1949, that my stay in Yaddo might as well have been in a monastery. The height of excitement for the musicians every evening was a game of charades in the vast Yaddo library, while those distinguished gentlemen, the composers, went to bed early and, to the best of my knowledge, alone with their manuscripts.

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"WHEN Natalie Wells bought a home in Englewood, N.J., a year ago, she was unaware that her American pit bull terrier was illegal to own in the city. Shortly after moving in, she was told by one of her daughters about a city law that banned the breed, commonly called pit bulls, along with several similar breeds and Rottweilers. Under the 1999 law, even this year's best-in-show winner at the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, Rufus, a colored bull terrier from Holmdel, N.J., would be banned in Englewood."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re: ''Race Wasn't an Issue to Him, Which Was an Issue to Me'' (Modern Love, Sept. 3): I was pleasantly surprised to find someone articulate the dilemma I encounter when dating white men. My parents, an interracial couple who have been together for 38 years, raised me with the belief that love could conquer anything. I have consequently suffered many romantic disappointments with people, white and of color, who didn't grapple with race or who grappled differently than I did."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Indianapolis (14-2) at Giants (11-5) 8:15 p.m., Channel 4 MANNING VS. MANNING For marketing purposes, the game has been diluted from Giants versus Colts to Eli versus Peyton, below. The Manning brothers will become the first siblings in N.F.L. history to start at quarterback for opposing teams. As they have pointed out repeatedly, they will not be facing each other directly, but that will not stop non-Mannings from comparing their performances. Mostly, it will provide the latest measure for how the unproven Eli -- entering his third season -- stacks up against a perennial Pro Bowl player like Peyton. MICHAEL STRAHANAND OSI UMENYIORA VS. DWIGHT FREENEY AND ROBERT MATHIS They will not directly face each other, either, but the starting defensive ends for the Giants and the Colts were the two best pass-rushing tandems in the N.F.L. last year. Strahan (11 1/2 sacks in 2005) and Umenyiora (14 1/2) had more sacks than any teammates; Freeney (11) and Mathis (11 1/2) were next. Both offenses will try to keep them at bay, but the four should play a big role in determining who wins the Manning versus Manning matchup -- and the game. JOHN BRANCH (NYT)"

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"KATHRYN BIGELOW made ''Point Break'' as if she were determined to show up all the big boys as sissies. She pumps this movie full of adrenaline like someone determined to see how much helium a balloon can hold before it bursts. This is the sort of picture in which the hero (Keanu Reeves, above left) is named Johnny Utah, and a bad guy about to meet his maker exclaims, ''I'll see you in hell, Johnny.'' It would be ridiculous if it weren't so delirious. Utah is an F.B.I. agent who goes undercover to bring down a group of surfers financing their pursuit of the big waves with a string of bank robberies. His nemesis is Bodhi, the surfing guru-bank robber who, as played by the marvelous Patrick Swayze, above right, is like a stoned version of the chest-thumping he-man Robert Shaw portrayed in ''Jaws.'' The Carlos Castaneda of machismo, Bodhi is ready with a quasi-mystical justification of everything from riding a tube to planning a heist."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"ON Sept. 11, 2001, I was a lieutenant in the Port Authority Police Department. After the attack, I became the night commander of the rescue and recovery operation at ground zero, charged with recovering the remains of my fellow officers and the thousands of other victims of the World Trade Center collapse. I and the 30 to 50 officers under my command worked at ground zero six or seven days a week for more than eight months among the two-million-ton mountain of shattered concrete, twisted steel and human remains. Pulling 19,000 body parts out of the rubble, we became accustomed to matching arms and legs like pairs of socks. When we got home, we still smelled like ground zero, with bitter-tasting dust and an odor of decay in our hair and on our skin. I couldn't hug my wife and children until after I had taken several showers."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"BECK--Edith. Passed away peacefully on September 5. Adored wife of the late Milton. Beloved mother of Steven and Ernest. Cherished grandmother of Amanda and Michael. Dear mother-in-law of Carol and Julie. Forever in our hearts.

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Joseph M. Delfino, the Republican mayor of White Plains, and Bill Ryan, one of the city's Democratic county legislators, are not on the best of terms. Ever since 1993, when Mr. Ryan challenged Mr. Delfino, then a county legislator, for his seat and lost, the pair have argued over everything. One of their longest running fights has centered on a county-owned downtown parking lot. Mr. Ryan wants to build an affordable housing complex for the elderly there, and so does Mr. Delfino. But they disagree on who should control the project. Mr. Delfino said it should be the city; Mr. Ryan, the county. The project has languished for about six years, and in an attempt to get it moving, Mr. Ryan recently announced that he would lease the site to developers, a plan Mr. Delfino opposes. Mr. Delfino said he was fighting for the principle of home rule. ''It's our community here,'' he said, ''White Plains is run by a local government. Who knows better than the administration about the needs of the city?''"
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"DEEP into suburbia, on a sound barrier that runs along the Taconic State Parkway here, a graffiti artist announces his presence with a single word painted in yellow and black: ''Me.'' Officials said that graffiti had reached new heights this summer. And in a town that bills itself as a retreat from more urban locales, politicians and police officers are taking the problem seriously."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Mount Yasur (below) on the island of Tanna in Vanuatu is billed as ''one of the most active and accessible volcanoes in the world,'' as reported in ''The Original Bali Hai'' by Jeffrey Gettleman (Aug. 27). It may be a little too accessible. When my wife and I visited Tanna as part of a training cruise on the tall ship Soren Larsen in 2004, we hiked to the rim of the volcano one evening and peered into the smoking, lava-belching interior. As if that wasn't impressive enough, a local guy wandered over and said that it was about time for a ''big one.'' Before we could contemplate what that might mean, there was a massive explosion. The mountain shook as globs of red-hot lava were thrown hundreds of feet over our heads. When molten rock began raining around us, we turned and ran. The local guy was smarter -- he stood his ground and watched the incoming glowing projectiles, the better to dodge any of them headed his way."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Brenda Ann Kenneally's photo essay (Aug. 27) put a scorching spotlight on the continuing tragedy of the disaster in the Gulf Coast region, laid bare by Hurricane Katrina. But we all know that the hurricane did more than expose the fault lines in New Orleans. It made visible the vulnerability of our nation's poor -- seen in your photos through the fragile existence of children, where upheaval and chaos are the norms and hope seems to present too great a risk. Most sadly, the photos could have been shot in virtually any city or town in our nation. As a whole year has passed, it's long overdue that we have a national discussion about race and opportunity in our country, about living-wage jobs and affordable housing that will light the way to economic security. Arnold S. Cohen President and C.E.O. The Partnership for the Homeless New York For me, the pictures in your photo essay were disturbing not only because they are of children who have lost everything but also because they are of children who have never known anything but poverty. The hurricane has merely exacerbated what we as a society chose to ignore the first time. Valerie Miller Ardmore, Pa."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"FIVE years ago my brother and I spoke regularly. Five years ago we drank together, teased each other without mercy and, occasionally, even expressed feelings of affection. After 9/11 we did not. My brother is a 20-plus-year veteran of the New York City Fire Department, a former marine with a degree in history whose politics are conservative. He is four years older and quite a bit larger than me. I am a 20-plus-year veteran of big-agency advertising, a creative director turned fiction writer whose politics, not surprisingly, do not lean conservatively. Until five years ago, this was not such a big problem. There were plenty of other things to talk about, and we knew that despite our differences, there was still much to appreciate about each other."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"At Hamburgão, the five-year-old Brazilian burger-and-sandwich shop in the heart of the Ironbound district in Newark, you may find yourself asking, ''Where's the beef?'' Not that there's a shortage at Hamburgão, whose name means ''big hamburger'' in Portuguese. It's just that it can be hard to see, covered as it is by voluminous toppings. The Cheese Tudo burger, for example, places mozzarella, fresh ham, bacon, a fried egg, kernels of corn, crunchy potato sticks, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise on top of a 5-ounce patty ($5). Although the toppings may seem like overload, they aren't. The only problem is fitting a little of everything into your mouth in one bite. It's impossible."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Caroline Burwell, 31, was thinking of that dreamboat Paul McCartney -- sweet, adorable early Paul -- and his thoroughly mod band mates when she came up with her fall collection for boys. ''The Beatles were the inspiration, their boy-band period,'' Ms. Burwell said. ''They looked so cute in their paisley florals and polka dots.'' Her Burwell New York label has updated the look for sizes 2 through 8, with Liberty of London flowered paisley shirts ($92), a handmade cashmere turtleneck sweater Ringo might have worn ($216) and a pinstripe vest ($82) with matching pants ($96, all at Barneys New York). Of course, cashmere turtlenecks and velveteen smoking jackets ($138, Scoop Kids) are hardly built for traipsing through playgrounds. They are more suited to future Hugh Hefners with generous allowances -- or maybe just for boys who want to be fab at 4. SUSAN GUERRERO"

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"PERHAPS partly because it was made at a time when movies often threw in a little something for everyone, there's a sappy love story tucked into the corners of ''Frankenstein.'' But it's inconsequential: there could be nothing in ''Frankenstein'' more romantic than Boris Karloff's monster, right. With his heavy-lidded gaze and his twisted smile, he's not quite human and yet more human than we can almost bear. To honor the movie's 75th anniversary, Universal unveils this special edition with extras that have not appeared on previous releases. (On the same date Universal will also release the 75th anniversary edition of ''Dracula.'' And Sept. 19 marks the release of the Boris Karloff Collection, featuring some of his lesser-known films, including ''Tower of London'' and ''The Strange Door,'' which co-stars Charles Laughton.) We learn that Karloff would entertain his fellow actors on-set with Cockney ditties, and insisted on breaking for tea."

Everything in the crazy quilt of later Modernism has been said to trace from his singular authority. But a new century rewrites the previous one. Young artists don't obsess about Picasso the way older ones did. It remains to be seen whether his prestige, which for nearly 100 years has been unimpeachable, will survive the next 100 intact."

With one turnover at the wrong time, players can be released, coaches fired and seasons lost. So it is no surprise that coaches stomp and scream until they are blue in the face about eliminating turnovers. But doing so is easier said than done. Why? Because turnovers have more to do with luck, or the lack thereof, than they do with poor execution. But if coaches and players know that, they have not let on."

SEAN McGINLEY, his brother, made an effort to keep Mark's memory alive by reaching out to other men who had lost brothers that day. ''BROTHERS LOST: STORIES OF 9/11'' (CINEMAX, Monday night at 7), the documentary he made about his experiences, includes interviews with 31 men. But, as Sean McGinley says, ''it was almost like it all added up to one story.'' In the middle of a sea of documentaries and news specials about Sept. 11 comes BRIAN SLOAN's ''WTC VIEW,'' a quirky, low-budget film that has its broadcast premiere on Sunday (LOGO, 10 p.m.). MICHAEL URIE stars as the young gay man who, on Sept. 10, 2001, places an ad looking for a roommate for his apartment, which has a fabulous view of the twin towers. Unlike most mainstream films on the subject, this one concentrates not on the attack itself or the people who died. Instead it focuses on what average New Yorkers were thinking, talking about and absorbing in the days afterward. After the second tower collapsed, the lead character's best female friend kept her appointment at the hairdresser. If you want to escape the 9/11 coverage, the best route may be to the past. TCM is showing classic episodes of ''THE DICK CAVETT SHOW.'' These are interviews with major stars, starting Thursday night at 8 with a 1971 show devoted entirely to WOODY ALLEN. Promoting his film ''Bananas,'' Mr. Allen was 35 at the time, 13 years into psychoanalysis (''I try not to give him any accurate information about myself'') and divorced from Louise Lasser (''I would marry again'').

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: It is easy to fall into the trap of assuming that biological accounts of human behavior deny environmental influences and assume an immutable nature. Even Richard Rorty, a retired professor of comparative literature and philosophy, falls into this trap in his review of my book ''Moral Minds'' (Aug. 27). Contrary to Rorty's portrayal, the idea that we are born with a universal moral grammar, like the idea that we are born with a universal grammar for language, doesn't deny the role of culture, nor does it make certain outcomes inevitable. Rather, it lays out a framework for exploring which aspects of our biology enable us to acquire a particular moral system, and which aspects of our moral principles are universal and which vary across cultures. In the same way that something about the biology of humans enables us, uniquely, to acquire certain types of languages, something about our biology must enable us, but not other animals, to acquire certain types of moral systems. The point is not that the content of moral systems is identical across cultures; the point is that people in all cultures can switch into a mode of cognition and emotion called ''morality'' with distinctive psychological properties. The men who stone witches or murder their unchaste sisters believe they are doing so for moral reasons, and it behooves us to understand the state of mind they are in. Rorty also misses the crucial distinction between how people judge moral actions and whether they would actually carry them out in the relevant situation; an exploding research literature shows that one does not imply the other. Furthermore, subjects with different cultural and demographic backgrounds often deliver identical moral judgments, while being unable to justify their choices. If people can't recover the principles that guide their judgments, then they certainly can't teach them to their children! This is the sense in which general-purpose learning fails and the analogy to language is significant. Contrary to Rorty, this doesn't mean that scientists should override parents, judges or teachers. But we all can benefit from a better understanding of the way that biological processes guide our unconscious, moral judgments and thereby exert powerful influences over how we perceive the world. By recognizing their influence we can better design our legal and educational systems. Contrary to Rorty's pessimism about the contributions of the sciences to our understanding of morality, I think it is essential for scientists and humanists to collaborate in sculpturing the work that lies ahead. If we share a universal moral grammar that enables us to acquire any of the world's moral systems, this ''should provide us with a sense of comfort, a sense that perhaps we can understand each other.''

Total misfires (''She Hate Me'') and unqualified triumphs (''Do the Right Thing'') are rare. His films typically oscillate from excellence to indulgence, often within a single scene. Thematic conflicts in a Spike Lee joint -- class, race, sex -- are inextricable from this artistic struggle: talent vs. discipline, precision against hyperbole, strength with actors wrestling a weakness for schematic characterizations. A genre framework can circumscribe these tensions. Recently released on DVD, the witty, well-received heist picture ''Inside Man'' suggests that Mr. Lee would make a splendid old-school Hollywood auteur, shading the margins of mainstream entertainments with his pet themes and trademark quirks.

But that isn't the pained and stubborn artist who gave us ''When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts,'' an epic account of Hurricane Katrina now playing on HBO and one of the year's must-see documentaries. Nor is it the filmmaker who risked addressing 9/11 with as bold, foolish and affecting a film as ''25TH HOUR,'' screening at the BAMcinématek on Monday. Adapted by David Benioff from his own novel, ''25th Hour'' says goodbye to Monty (Edward Norton), a New York drug dealer preparing to serve a seven-year prison sentence. To the strains of Terrence Blanchard's score (unusually subdued when it's not moaning hysterically), the movie riffs on regret and resignation as it winds through Monty's parting moments with his girlfriend (Rosario Dawson), father (Brian Cox) and two best friends (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper). The film's audacity -- or for some viewers, its Achilles' heel -- is to connect this bruised melodrama to the dark wound at ground zero. Accusations of opportunism are hard to refute; the intended effect is inchoate by design. But its numb lament feels even more powerful in light of recent handlings of 9/11, whether as hyperrealist action film (''United 93'') or patriotic superproduction (''World Trade Center''). 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''Upgrade the Canal? Many Panamanians Are Saying No'' (news article, Sept. 3) states that ''many Panamanians intend to vote against the expansion.'' But the latest polls show that fewer than 20 percent of respondents say they'll vote against the expansion. The article does not mention the thorough cost estimates developed by the Panama Canal Authority. These estimates have been supported by international consultants and reviewed by renowned experts. Instead, the article quotes a disgruntled retired canal employee, whose employment ended in 2000, as a source regarding the project's cost."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"GUSTAVO DUDAMEL has quickly come a long way from his boyhood in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, when he used to conduct toy soldiers. He has attracted glowing praise from Simon Rattle, Claudio Abbado and Daniel Barenboim, and a reputation as a rising star of the podium. And he's still just a tender 25. Mr. Dudamel is one of five musicians selected here as artists on the cusp of promising futures. He is a product of one of the classical music world's most extraordinary phenomena: Venezuela's youth orchestra system. Financed by the government and the Inter-American Development Bank, it has yielded scores of youth orchestras and trained hundreds of thousands of players, many from poor neighborhoods."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"DUNBAUGH--Edwin Lane. Hofstra University is profoundly saddened by the death of Edwin Lane Dunbaugh, Ph.D., Distinguished Professor Emeritus of History who was an integral part of the Hofstra community since 1954 and who witnessed the growth of the University over the ensuing 50 years. Professor Dunbaugh was proud of his military service during WWII where he served as a naval medical corpsman. He graduated from Franklin and Marshall College cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He was a recipient of Fulbright Scholarship to the University of Vienna where he worked on his doctoral dissertation and received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. Professor Dunbaugh was not only a scholar of history, co-authoring a popular text, ''Mainstreams of Civilization,'' but also authored seven books on the history of steamboats, an abiding personal and intellectual interest which made him a leading scholar on the subject. Throughout his lengthy career, Professor Dunbaugh shared his great enthusiasm and passion for European History and the History of the Ancient World with his students. In 1970, in recognition of his exceptional skills as a teacher, the graduating class conferred upon him the prestigious and coveted Distinguished Teacher of the Year Award. He will be remembered by the Hofstra Community as a great scholar and devoted friend and will be greatly missed by his many students who became his lifelong friends. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family. In tribute to the memory of Professor Dunbaugh, all Hofstra University flags will be lowered to half staff. John D. Miller Chair, Board of Trustees Stuart Rabinowitz President Hofstra University"
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"INDIAN restaurants have opened with welcome regularity in Westchester, each offering dishes as diverse and discrete as the region of India that is their inspiration. Now Bukhara Grill has come to town, with a kitchen that knocks out the lush dishes of Northern India with unique skill, balancing the myriad flavors so well that each taste plays and teases briefly on the tongue before merging into a delicious whole. The restaurant's décor is hardly impressive. There is a cold hollowness in its unadorned walls and a ceiling so high that one can easily overlook two crystal chandeliers, an odd match for bare pine tables better suited to a cozy log cabin. But what the restaurant lacks in ambience it makes up for with some mighty gorgeous food."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Clothing from the designer Rachel Roy recalls a time when women had impeccable manners, hourglass figures and the good sense to flaunt them with clothes on. Ms. Roy, who presented her fourth collection in New York City last week, finds inspiration in silhouettes from the 1930's, 40's and 50's, when ''women were allowed to look feminine and strong at the same time,'' she said. From an aesthetic standpoint, she added, ''Dresses with high waists and full flowing skirts make women look a lot slimmer.'' Ms. Roy, 32, who lives in TriBeCa with her husband, the hip-hop mogul Damon Dash, and her 6-year-old daughter, Ava, is ladylike in the extreme. ''I wear a dress or skirt with a belt, shoes and a bag almost every day,'' said the designer, who enforces a no-denim policy in her office. (On weekends, however, she likes vintage Levi's and current Chloé jeans, which she described as ''long and high-waisted, very Bianca Jagger in the 70's.'')"

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"ON Sept. 11, 2001, I was a lieutenant in the Port Authority Police Department. After the attack, I became the night commander of the rescue and recovery operation at ground zero, charged with recovering the remains of my fellow officers and the thousands of other victims of the World Trade Center collapse. I and the 30 to 50 officers under my command worked at ground zero six or seven days a week for more than eight months among the two-million-ton mountain of shattered concrete, twisted steel and human remains. Pulling 19,000 body parts out of the rubble, we became accustomed to matching arms and legs like pairs of socks. When we got home, we still smelled like ground zero, with bitter-tasting dust and an odor of decay in our hair and on our skin. I couldn't hug my wife and children until after I had taken several showers."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"BONDER--Diane A. This notes the sad and untimely death of independent filmmaker Diane A. Bonder, 46. Diane died at her home in Brooklyn on June 23, almost a year after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She was predeceased by her beloved father John Bonder and mother Geraldine (Cleerdin) Bonder, and is survived by her partner Terri Burger, her aunt Virginia, uncle Bob, cousin Mark and his children Lauren and Steven, as well as by her dear friends--her other family. Diane made lo-fi experimental film and video in documentary, poetic, and semi-narrative styles. She maintained a longstanding relationship with Millennium Film Workshop, where she taught herself the optical printing techniques which became part of her signature visual style. Retrospective screenings of her work have been held at MoMA, Hall Walls (Buffalo) and Millennium Film Workshop, and Diane was a regular contributor to both the Mix NYC and Mad Cat Women's Festivals. In addition to residencies at UCross (Wyoming) and Squeaky Wheel (Buffalo, NY), she received numerous grants including NYFA and NYSCA in 2003. Her work has screened throughout the US and internationally and received many awards. A former resident of Northampton and Boston, MA, Diane graduated with her BA from UMAss Amherst, studied photography at the Photographic Resource Center in Boston and received her MFA from Rutgers University. In 1996 Diane made Brooklyn, NY, her home. In addition to being an accomplished and prolific filmmaker, she also ran her own graphic design company, Rat Star Designs, catering primarily to nonprofit organizations. Diane was loving, strong, passionate, creative, feisty, frugal, determined, loyal and an inspiration. Cherished and loved by her many close friends and family, she will be forever missed. A memorial service to celebrate her life will be held beginning at 11:30 AM, Saturday, September 16, at St. Mark's Sanctuary (Dan space), 131 East 10th St., Manhattan. A fund has been established to support experimental filmmakers in Diane's name. Contributions may be sent to the ''Diane Bonder Memorial Fund'' at Millennium Film Workshop, 66 East 4th St., NYC, NY 10003."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"When a new music season wakes up, it is usually the New York City Opera that is first to stir. The company opens on Wednesday with the 11th in its long-running series of Handel productions. In ''SEMELE,'' we are to be treated to conflict and revenge among the gods by way of Ovid. ELIZABETH FUTRAL sings the title role. ANTONY WALKER conducts. The production is directed by STEPHEN LAWLESS. For the mortal Semele, social mobility comes in jolts. First an eagle snatches her from humankind and takes her to the heavens and the arms of Jupiter. Egged on by Juno, his thwarted wife, Semele oversteps in her quest for immortality and is consumed by fire. Bar patrons today can take comfort that from her ashes will rise Bacchus, the ancient god of booze. First done in 1744, ''Semele'' followed Handel's successful switch to oratorios. The heavy tilt toward chorus numbers against a counterweight of wholly operatic da capo arias makes it something of a hybrid dangling between the concert stage and the theater. The libretto has a distinguished source, William Congreve. ''Semele'' was put on in Washington a quarter of a century ago, but the people at the City Opera think that these will be its first professional performances in New York City. After Wednesday's opening night, ''Semele'' will be repeated Friday and next Sunday afternoon, with four more performances to follow. Bizet's familiar ''Carmen'' will be intertwined with Handel's less familiar piece. ''Carmen'' plays on Thursday and repeats on Saturday, with 12 more performances to come. Joining Ms. Futral in mutual sexpottery is RINAT SHAHAM taking Bizet's title role. ARI PELTO will conduct this JONATHAN EATON production. ''Semele,'' Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Friday at 8 p.m.; ''Carmen,'' Thursday at 7 p.m. and Saturday at 1:30 p.m.; New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500.; $25 to $125."

Convicted as a sexually violent predator -- the highest-risk category, Level 3 -- he is barred from parks and places with many children.

He does not plan to go back again tomorrow. He has someplace else he would rather be, nearer to where his son lived than to where he died. Mr. Cahill and his son Scott were in the municipal bond business, commuters to Lower Manhattan from their home in West Caldwell, and he was working at his office on Rector Street when the first plane hit the World Trade Center. Scott was on the 104th floor of the north tower, in the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald. Mr. Cahill kept trying the cellphone, but got nothing.

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"FIVE years ago my brother and I spoke regularly. Five years ago we drank together, teased each other without mercy and, occasionally, even expressed feelings of affection. After 9/11 we did not. My brother is a 20-plus-year veteran of the New York City Fire Department, a former marine with a degree in history whose politics are conservative. He is four years older and quite a bit larger than me. I am a 20-plus-year veteran of big-agency advertising, a creative director turned fiction writer whose politics, not surprisingly, do not lean conservatively. Until five years ago, this was not such a big problem. There were plenty of other things to talk about, and we knew that despite our differences, there was still much to appreciate about each other."

She says that whites are averse to discussing race -- this is regretfully true. But she absolves herself of willfully maintaining the division. If she wants whites to discuss race and be faced with it, she must understand their hesitation."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"FOR me, last winter was the end of the affair with oil. My stocky furnace, grunting and firing in the basement, guzzled its way through four thousand dollars' worth. I decided I would no longer slake its fueloholic thirst, even at the summer lock-in price of just under $3 a gallon. ''Lock in to lunacy,'' I thought. Oil has become the liquid gold we long suspected. So I must balance my budget with my fear of the unknown: wood stoves."

Under the 1999 law, even this year's best-in-show winner at the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, Rufus, a colored bull terrier from Holmdel, N.J., would be banned in Englewood."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Kim Cornett of Arlington, Va.: ''The botanical gardens were really peaceful, so it was weird to think that just five minutes away was the ramshackle elegance of the city center. At the top is this waterfall, there were teenage couples making out and just a ton of kids swimming in swim trunks or underwear or nothing, just trying to cool off. They were showing off and diving and flipping and seeing who could climb the farthest up this slippery rock and then do something outrageous to come down, or stealing each other's clothes and running away. I'm probably romanticizing it, but it seemed like unadulterated joy, just kids enjoying the simple pleasures: a chance to get cool and kind of be.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

But like a good many events masquerading as simple entertainment, the festival, which returns for a second run on Sept. 13, was the beginning of a larger mission for Jon Yanofsky and his staff, who had watched the region metamorphose and had not liked what they believed was a limited cultural response to the changes."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"BEFORE the accident that paralyzed Christopher Reeve, it was all you could do to convince people that such a charming, good-looking guy was also a wonderful actor. After the accident he became so beloved that his performances were almost beside the point. It would be fitting if this eight-disc collection (two discs for each of his four Superman movies) focused attention on the beauty of Reeve's performances as the man from Krypton and his alter ego, Clark Kent. Reeve was blessed with some of the best comic timing the movies have seen since the heyday of screwball. His Superman takes great pleasure in playacting the super nerd Kent. You feel a prankster's joy behind Kent's every klutzy move, every whinging bit of jealousy he admits to feeling over the adoration Margot Kidder's Lois Lane, above, has for Superman."

Neither yellowed by history's aura nor piously unblemished, the unbound stack of 18 pages looked more like a term paper than a century-old artifact in the university's new Leonard L. Milberg Irish Theater Collection. In fact, the manuscript, which became the second act of O'Casey's seminal work ''The Plough and the Stars,'' looked so ordinary that Paul Muldoon, the poet and Princeton professor, at first overlooked it while perusing other samples of the collection, which was donated in his honor. The university announced the gift Aug. 29."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"HE sits in his wheelchair as the family rushes around him. He cannot move much, or say more than hello. He cannot participate in the summer activities that everyone pursues with great vigor day after day. If it's warm enough, he goes out onto the deck and snoozes in the sun with the dogs. Unlike them, however, he doesn't jump up and make excited noises when people come. At most, he slowly turns his head and smiles. Everyone speaks to him politely, but not for long. What's the point? He can't say more than a couple of words, and it's hard to tell how much he understands. He is my stepfather, Peter, an 88-year-old man who in the last decade has been transformed from a lively and dynamic person into not much more than a body occupying space. He has post-polio syndrome, a condition that seeps the strength from his upper body as steadily as it weakened his legs when he was a teenager. A couple of strokes have further debilitated him. As my son, Asher, said to my mother one day, it's as if he's hardly a person anymore."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"They say it takes a village to raise a child, but Rick Mockler and Ann Block think maybe it just takes a co-housing development. The couple had just had a daughter when they heard about a new community called Muir Commons in Davis, Calif., where residents own their homes but share the common property surrounding them. Unlike a gated community, a co-housing development is designed and managed by the residents themselves, who make up the rules, share the workload and see their neighbors as an extended clan. ''Because people live in proximity and know one another so well, there's a lot of spontaneous interaction, like a concert or a movie night in the common house, and so many activities for the kids,'' says Mockler, who is now a vice president of CoHousing Partners, a group that develops co-housing communities in California. ''We've lived here for 10 years. It's a great way to raise a family.''"

While Goldwater is widely viewed as the father of modern conservatism, the truth is that the party he came from is scarcely visible today. The neocons and the religious right have essentially written United States policy for six years, gobbling resources, spending money and interfering with personal choices in a way that Barry himself most likely would have abhorred.

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Andy Warhol had quite an interesting life. One of the most celebrated artists of the 20th century, he was born in Pittsburgh to Czech immigrants. Making his way to New York, he became a successful graphic artist, specializing in illustrations of shoes for advertisements. He exhibited his drawings to no critical notice, eventually dabbling in paintings of dollar bills, comic strips and soup cans; at first he painted them by hand, then later turned to screen printing. By 1962 he was the leading figure in American Pop Art."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"WHEN affluent suburbanites travel, they can be quite fussy, demanding that airplanes show up and take off like clockwork and that anything less is -- to use a word the fastidious favor -- unacceptable. But when they're lounging in their backyards, they want the skies to be jet-free, or at least noise-free; if jets must be seen, they should not be heard. The problem in hubs like New York is that the two desires are fast becoming irreconcilable. American airlines handled 739 million passengers last year; by 2015 that number is expected to balloon to 1 billion. No one wants an airport sprouting next door, with all the attendant whines, drones and roars, so the Federal Aviation Administration has been trying to squeeze in more flights by rejiggering the way planes use air space in the corridor between Philadelphia and Connecticut."

The peacekeepers, however, would be required to prevent rearmament by blocking Syrian supply routes. Someone is sure to ask: If supplies to Hezbollah are to be cut off, shouldn't supplies from the United States to Israel be equally forbidden? That is shocking, from an American point of view. The Israelis are the ''good guys,'' while Hezbollah is ''bad.'' But a large portion of the world does not see it that way, reminding us that the first United States response to the July fighting was not to call for a cease-fire but to prepare to send an emergency supply of weapons to Israel.

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"An estimated 10,000 to 15,000 tons of oil spilled in mid-July from a power station south of Beirut that was bombed by Israeli warplanes could now threaten not just the Lebanese coastline -- where international and teams are working to remove the washed-up oil -- but also the beaches of Cyprus, Turkey, Greece and Israel. ''When the currents change this autumn and winter, the oil, which has been moving south, will start to move north, circling from right to left like a clock, and will eventually hit those coastlines,'' said Fouad Hamdan, director of the environmental group Friends of the Earth Europe. ''It is not only the worst environmental disaster ever in the Eastern Mediterranean Coast,'' Mr. Hamdan said, comparing it to the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989, ''but another serious economic blow to tourism in the area, as this oil could keep showing up for years.''"

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"THE NEW YORK MUSICAL THEATER FESTIVAL returns with 34 new musicals, including ''FLIGHT OF THE LAWNCHAIR MAN,'' written by PETER ULLIAN (''Elliot Ness in Cleveland'') with music and lyrics by ROBERT LINDSAY-NASSIF (''Opal'') and starring CHRISTOPHER SUTTON and DONNA LYNNE CHAMPLIN (Pirelli in the recent revival of ''Sweeney Todd''). The musical, directed and choreographed by LYNNE TAYLOR-CORBETT (''Swing!'') is about a man from Passaic, N.J., who dreams of, well, flying in his, um, lawn chair. It was presented last year by Goodspeed Musicals in Connecticut, but when it had its premiere, it was the best-reviewed third of a trio of mini-musicals at Prince Music Theater in Philadelphia, where it was directed by HAROLD PRINCE -- yes, that Harold Prince. Opens Wednesday, 37 Arts Theater, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 352-3101; $20. AMI DAYAN's adaptation of ALAN DRURY's widely produced 1975 play, ''THE MAN HIMSELF,'' opening Sunday at 59E59 Theaters, is Mr. Dayan's second variation on the play. The original, produced by the National Theater in London, was about an Englishman's drift toward fascism. In 1992, for a theater festival in Israel, Mr. Dayan reimagined the title character as an Israeli soldier in the extremist Kahane movement. This time the character, played by Mr. Dayan, is a manager at an electrical goods warehouse in contemporary Denver who is drawn to radical Christian fundamentalism. ''It was such a mad idea I had to say yes,'' Mr. Drury, who collaborated with Mr. Dayan on the adaptation, told The Denver Post. Through Oct. 1, 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; $25. And on Tuesday the CULTURE PROJECT kicks off its seven-week Impact Festival with the world premiere of EVE ENSLER's ''TREATMENT,'' about a troubled former soldier and military interrogator (DYLAN McDERMOTT) and the psychologist (PORTIA) who is assigned to him for routine treatment. Opening Sept. 12, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100; $55."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"IF you were an employee of a company and were disgruntled with its performance, who would you want to hold accountable? The chief executive, who is popular with key constituents and wields clout over your financial well-being? Or at least one, if not two, of the chief executive's top lieutenants, both unpopular, and presumably easy to scapegoat? That, essentially, is the question that faces State Senator Thomas H. Kean Jr. as he grapples with the biggest political issue in his race to unseat United States Senator Robert Menendez: the war in Iraq."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"In late August the heavily galleried streets of Chelsea could be mistaken for a ghost town. The only things missing are tumbleweeds and a Sergio Leone soundtrack. But the limousines started finding their way back last week as the first in a burst of new shows opened. And this week the streets will be even busier as more shows open and crowds take advantage of the last precious month of milling-outside weather. Shows by two veteran provocateurs, one American and the other German, are among those worth seeing. At the Gladstone Gallery is an exhibition of the black-and-white architectural photographs of CATHERINE OPIE, who first made her name with gorgeously formal pictures of herself and others, often heavily pierced and tattooed, in drag, in sadomasochistic gear and sometimes in pain. But for the last decade Ms. Opie, a professor of photography at the University of California, Los Angeles, has turned her camera on the facades of houses in Bel-Air and Beverly Hills, the freeways and minimalls of Los Angeles, and the often crumbling roadside scenes that she has come upon while driving around the country. Ms. Opie, who has called herself ''a twisted social documentary photographer,'' manages to infuse these banal urban and suburban landscapes with the same kind of other-ness and vague unease of her portraits. Through Oct. 14, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9300. The German artist GEORG HEROLD, who is having an exhibition at the Friedrich Petzel Gallery, has also long worked at the intersection of the mundane and the mutinous. In his case the materials he uses -- baking powder, vodka bottles, lone bricks stuffed into expanses of foam rubber, underwear stretched on wire, ''paintings'' made with shellacked caviar -- flirt humorously and provocatively with definitions of art and with art's power (or lack of it) to make political statements. Mr. Herold has described his work as constructions of ''stupid materials,'' but they are ones that can ask intelligent and interesting questions. Through Oct. 21, 537 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467."

BOLSHOI BALLET The company, directed by Alexei Ratmansky, will perform a traditional staging of ''Don Quixote'' and a ''Cinderella'' choreographed by Yuri Possokhov, seen in New York last season with the San Francisco Ballet.

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Alma Winemiller is the old maid's old maid. And Amanda Plummer is all over her like a swarm of drugged Southern bees in Hartford Stage's heartfelt and heart-wrenching new production of ''Summer and Smoke.'' Tennessee Williams often said that Miss Alma, as almost everyone calls her, was his finest female character and the one most like him. She is a Mississippi minister's daughter, still relatively young in the years just before World War I but already spinsterish, admiring of the ''everlasting struggle'' between good and evil represented by Gothic cathedrals, and eventually dependent on and grateful for ''little mercies,'' like her prescription for sleeping tablets."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"WHEN Natalie Wells bought a home in Englewood, N.J., a year ago, she was unaware that her American pit bull terrier was illegal to own in the city. Shortly after moving in, she was told by one of her daughters about a city law that banned the breed, commonly called pit bulls, along with several similar breeds and Rottweilers. Under the 1999 law, even this year's best-in-show winner at the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, Rufus, a colored bull terrier from Holmdel, N.J., would be banned in Englewood."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"WHEN affluent suburbanites travel, they can be quite fussy, demanding that airplanes show up and take off like clockwork and that anything less is -- to use a word the fastidious favor -- unacceptable. But when they're lounging in their backyards, they want the skies to be jet-free, or at least noise-free; if jets must be seen, they should not be heard. The problem in hubs like New York is that the two desires are fast becoming irreconcilable. American airlines handled 739 million passengers last year; by 2015 that number is expected to balloon to 1 billion. No one wants an airport sprouting next door, with all the attendant whines, drones and roars, so the Federal Aviation Administration has been trying to squeeze in more flights by rejiggering the way planes use air space in the corridor between Philadelphia and Connecticut."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: After reading ''Dust to Dust: An Affair Post 9/11'' (Modern Love, Aug. 27), I wondered if the author, Nikki Stern, considered the wife of the man with whom she had her three-and-a-half-year affair? When that woman learns of her husband's betrayal, the truth of her life will be undermined by the lies in which Ms. Stern collaborated. Her world will no longer be a secure, predictable place either.

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I take issue with ''Big Bag, Bigger, Biggest,'' (Pulse, Sept. 3). The text that accompanies the photographs says that these purses are perfect for carrying as much as ''three diet delivery meals'' and can double as a refuge when one needs to ''hide from those hectoring paparazzi.''"

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"For most Americans, bigger means better when it comes to home size. But for a small number of people, the extreme opposite is true. They prefer to live in tiny dwellings that are to normal-sized houses what bonsai are to trees: miniaturized but not diminished. These super-downsized homes are eco-friendly, affordable and built with an extraordinary attention to detail."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I took my teenage sister to see Nilaja Sun's ''No Child,'' about the crumbling public education system. My sister, deeply affected, asked, ''Is it really like that in some schools?'' The play had a small but significant effect on her future civic consciousness. I remember seeing ''Sarafina!'' when I was 11, aware of the headlines about apartheid but not the human stories connected to it. The musical turned me into the voter, citizen and writer I am today. Plays may not significantly affect election results. But they have a place in shaping the next generation of thinkers.

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"NEW YORK The News -- Katie Couric made her debut as a network news anchor. Behind the News -- The reviews were mixed for Ms. Couric, with many critics describing her first broadcast as a journalistic hodgepodge, mixing the serious (a report from Afghanistan) with the not-so-serious (a first photo of Tom Cruise's baby). For all the buildup about a new era at CBS News, in the end her broadcast didn't seem all that different from the others. But the opening night audience, estimated at 13.6 million viewers, was the largest for the network's signature newscast in eight years. DETROIT The News -- The Ford Motor Company brought in an aircraft industry executive, Alan J. Mulally, to help run it. Behind the News -- For William Clay Ford Jr., the company's chairman, the move was an admission that Ford needed new approaches to increase sales and profits. But some strategies Mr. Mulally adopts may end up sounding familiar to Ford executives. In overhauling the commercial aircraft business at Boeing, where he worked for 37 years, Mr. Mulally studied some Ford projects, including the development of the Taurus in the mid-1980's. MEXICO The News -- Mexico's highest electoral court declared Felipe Calderón the country's new president, after two months of dispute. Behind the News -- Mr. Calderón, a conservative who will take office Dec. 1, reached out to supporters of his leftist rival, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, saying he was open to some of their ideas. But Mr. López Obrador, whose claim of widespread voting fraud was rejected by the court, would have none of it. He refused to recognize Mr. Calderón's victory and plans to establish an alternative government. JAPAN The News -- Princess Kiko gave birth to a boy, defusing a debate in Japan about whether women should be allowed to ascend to the imperial throne. Behind the News -- The infant, as yet unnamed, was the first male born in the imperial family in 41 years. Both Princess Kiko and her sister-in-law, Crown Princess Masako, have daughters, but under the imperial system they cannot become empress. A panel of experts last year had recommended the system be changed, but action on the recommendations was postponed when Princess Kiko's pregnancy was announced. WASHINGTON The News -- Ronald Reagan will return to Washington in the form of a statue at the National Statuary Hall in the Capitol. Behind the News -- The good news for fans of Mr. Reagan was bad news for the admittedly fewer fans of another Republican, Thomas Starr King, whose bronze will be removed. King, a Civil War-era California politician who preached national unity, fell victim to rules allowing only two statues per state. In approving plans to enshrine Mr. Reagan, the California Legislature decided that the missionary Junipero Serra could stay, but that King had to go."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"The growing threat of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism hasn't been a boon to most of the world, but it has had one surprising side effect: increased storage space in Singapore. Thanks to a law designed to counter the terrorism threat, some Singaporeans have ended up with walk-in closets that double as bomb shelters, or shelters that double as closets, depending on their point of view."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Fans of the lyrical qualities of 19th-century paintings -- purity, serenity, sentiment -- will find a visit to the Bush-Holley Historic Site in Cos Cob immensely appealing. There, the latest installation in a series of exhibitions devoted to artists who lived and worked in the Greenwich area presents the work of John Henry Twachtman (1853-1902), one of America's most genteel and popular Impressionist painters. Twachtman is a particularly appropriate choice for this museum. He was a cornerstone of a lively late-19th-century art colony centered on the Bush-Holley House -- where he lived from time to time as a guest and painted and taught other artists. He also bought a 17-acre property in Greenwich, where he did his finest work. The current exhibition is a selection of paintings produced on his Greenwich property, coupled with a handful of works done on his travels to Massachusetts, California and Europe."
2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"The tropical storm that barreled through the Northeast a week ago caused more damage to Con Edison's system than any storm in the last two decades, company officials say, plunging nearly a quarter of the utility's Westchester customers into darkness and leaving a vast trail of snapped trees and downed power lines. By the end of the week, company officials estimated that as many as 76,000 customers in Westchester, or about 300,000 people, had lost electricity as a result of the storm, in many cases for days. Tropical Storm Ernesto felled about 100 trees and 900 wires throughout the county, creating more than 2,000 repair jobs for emergency crews, said William McGrath, Con Edison's vice president for the Bronx and Westchester."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"QUATTRO FIGLI (''Four Sons'' in Italian) is so engaging that it is easy to overlook some inconsistency in the cooking. Several factors account for the charm of this small Greenwich restaurant: one vibrantly lemon-painted wall with wry, stylized drawings; white wood trim so immaculate it looks newly painted; artful displays of lemons along the room divider; colorful Fiesta-style tableware; and an overall spotlessness. Add a cheerful, welcoming staff led by the owner, Robert Rosenfeld, who is also the official greeter, and a short menu that differs from the usual Italian, and the result is an upbeat dining experience. As for the food, it all tastes freshly made, and many dishes really hit the mark, beginning with olives marinated in olive oil and good crusty house-made bread."

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"What was supposed to have been summer's last hurrah instead became another quest for any available stretch of sand and surf. Many Suffolk County residents found themselves warned off their neighborhood beaches over the Labor Day weekend, just as Long Islanders had been periodically throughout the rainy summer. Downpours and the elevated bacterial levels in the water that resulted led Suffolk and Nassau County health officials to close or issue warnings against swimming at a patchwork of beaches and parks for days at a stretch in June, July and August."

According to the Audit Bureau of Circulation, the average paid monthly circulation has increased 226,000 to 1,856,000 from 1,630,000.

2006-09-10T00:00:00Z,"The Shore Institute of the Contemporary Arts in Long Branch has unveiled its big fall exhibition titled ''Stuff It!'' -- a riotous ensemble of artworks employing stuffed objects. It is a victory of a kind for this plucky institution, for in May it nearly closed for lack of funds. But it was saved by an anonymous donation of $20,000 from a famous Shore rock musician. It has also just received a grant of $22,000 from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts. The exhibition was organized by Doug Ferrari, an artist who founded the institute and mortgaged his home two years ago to open the nonprofit space. For this exhibition he has chosen artists from all over the country, drawing on submissions through an informal national open call, along with recommendations from friends and other artists. Most of the artists are women, and all of the contributors seem to make art that involves filling, stuffing, inflating, upholstering or padding of one kind or another."

At ABC's ''Good Morning America'' the senior executive producer, Jim Murphy, will use the transition at ''Today'' to try wooing enough people over to ABC to erase what was a nearly 900,000-viewer advantage. Mr. Murphy is also trying to make sure that loyal viewers do not abandon ''Good Morning America'' as it goes through a major transition of its own: the departure of Charles Gibson.

Like MySpace, the sites are designed for browsing and blogging, with some shopping-related technology twists included.

[C6.] THE PRETEXT MASQUERADE -- At the heart of the controversy swirling around Hewlett-Packard is the technique known as pretexting -- obtaining the calling records of people under a pretext, like masquerading as a customer.

A two-hour CBS documentary, ''9/11,'' drew 10.6 million viewers in Nielsen's estimates, but NBC's first Sunday Night Football game far overshadowed it as well as the start of Fox's Sunday night lineup. The much-hyped matchup of the Indianapolis Colts and New York Giants, right, gave NBC a windfall of about 22.7 million, better than ABC's Monday Night Football openers in recent years. Nonetheless Fox's slate remained solid, especially among younger viewers. At 8 p.m. the premiere of the 18th season of ''The Simpsons'' led the night for Fox with 11.51 million viewers: third overall but second to NBC among adults 18-49. ''The Simpsons'' also lifted Fox's ''American Dad'' at 8:30, which drew 8.95 million, up 14 percent from its premiere last season. At 9 the ''Family Guy'' premiere posted a fourth-place 9.85 million, but in the 18-to-49 demographic was second only to football. It did not, however, do much for the premiere of Fox's only Sunday night live-action comedy, ''The War at Home,'' which drew a middling 7.35 million at 9:30. BENJAMIN TOFF"

A red-carpet European premiere in London on Sunday night, attended by Cherie Blair and the cast of ''Billy Elliot,'' among other celebrities, promoted the film's scheduled release on Disney Channels throughout Europe on Sept. 22. In most countries the dialogue will be dubbed, while the songs will remain in English.

The work, ''Rue St.-Honoré, Après-Midi, Effet de Pluie,'' above right, a Parisian street scene made in 1897, has been on display at the state-owned museum since 1993, when the Spanish government paid $350 million to buy Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza's collection.

He underwent surgery last November for an intestinal ailment and did not act for four months; since then he has only completed the work to which he had already committed.

Mr. Spitzer's defeat of his Democratic opponent, Thomas R.

2006-09-13T00:00:00Z,"LORBERBAUM--Alan, S. An entrepreneur, carpet industry pioneer and philanthropist, died Saturday at his home in Boca Raton, Florida. He was 82. Alan was a dynamic and innovative leader in the carpet and rug industry for more than 40 years. He and his late wife, Shirley, founded Aladdin Mills, Inc., and built it into one of the industry's leading manufacturers. In 1994, Aladdin merged with Mohawk Industries, which later became the largest flooring manufacturer in the world. Alan became Mohawk's major shareholder and joined its Board of Directors. In 1957, he founded Aladdin Mills in a former skating rink. Aladdin focused on the rug and bath mat business until the late 1970's. With his engineering background, Mr. Lorberbaum created unique and efficient manufacturing processes that gave Aladdin a low cost position in the market. His hobby was his business, and he spent the majority of his time perfecting it. He described his role as being similar to that of a conductor leading a premier symphony orchestra. Aladdin moved aggressively into the carpet business in the late 1980's after many companies were already well established in the market. Mr. Lorberbaum established a talented team of executives to build Aladdin into an industry leader. Aladdin was among the first carpet producers to invest in a fiber extrusion, as well as a distribution and trucking system that enabled the company to provide a higher level of service than the industry standard. Mr. Lorberbaum referred to it as ''sudden service'' and it was a mantra he institutionalized in the organization. These investments allowed Aladdin to grow into one of the largest carpet manufacturers in America. Mr. Lorberbaum was fiercely devoted to his employees and believed that all problems in businesses were caused by their managements. He saw his employees as and extension of his family, and his kindness, respect and generosity toward them reinforced that the feeling no matter how large the company grew. In 1994, Mr. Lorberbaum recognized that the industry was consolidating, and that the company required additional capital to grow even faster. To accomplish this, he planned to take to the company public. During the last stage of the process, Mohawk Industries proposed a merger with Aladdin. Mr. Lorberbaum correctly foresaw the value in combining the companies and the power of their collective strength. Mr. Lorberbaum's legacy goes well beyond the company he founded. Through his philanthropic endeavors, he focused on sup porting issues that impact education from his early childhood development through higher education. He believed education is essential to the success of individuals and communities."

2006-09-13T00:00:00Z,"President Bush's 17-minute address on Monday night fell smack in the middle of the second part of ABC's contentious ''Path to 9/11'' mini-series, with Harvey Keitel. But the thematic synchronicity, which also extended to a 9/11 ''Primetime'' afterward, may have helped lift ABC to No. 1 for the night, averaging about 12 million viewers over all, according to Nielsen's estimates. CBS inserted the president's 9 p.m. speech into a lineup of repeats: ''How I Met Your Mother'' (5.9 million) at 8, ''The New Adventures of Old Christine'' (5.5 million) at 8:30, and ''Two and a Half Men'' (7.6 million) after the speech. A repeat of ''CSI: Miami'' (8.3 million) followed, propelling CBS to No. 2 for the night. On Fox, the interruption may account for some of the drop-off for ''Vanished'' (5.9 million), which paled in comparison with the solid audience at 8 for the serial drama ''Prison Break'' (8.8 million). That episode, which included the bloody death of the escapee Abruzzi (Peter Stormare), led over all for the hour among adults 18 to 49. NBC's ''Dateline'' (6.1 million) from 8 to 10, which paused for Mr. Bush's speech, could not compensate for a ''Medium'' repeat at 10 (4.8 million), which drove the network to a subdued last place for the night.

Because of enormous interest in the paintings, ''the museum will display them, in their current state, to the public and the media, for a short period,'' a statement said. Both paintings were damaged but ''are in better shape than expected,'' said Jorun Christoffersen, a museum spokeswoman, who added, ''They will need some major restoration work.'' A photograph, above, released by the museum on its Web site, www.munch.museum.no, showed that the lower left corner of ''The Scream'' was crumpled, and that ''Madonna'' had a scratch and a tear in the canvas. The paintings, stolen in 2004 in broad daylight, were recovered two weeks ago. The police have not said how they retrieved them. Before they were recovered, three men were convicted of complicity in the theft. Turkish Novelist Faces Trial A prominent Turkish novelist who faces trial next week for ''insulting Turkishness'' says the case is the first to pivot on words uttered by fictional characters, Reuters reported. The novelist, Elif Shafak, above, a feminist who writes in English and Turkish, has been charged in connection with her new novel, ''The Bastard of Istanbul.'' The case is being followed closely by the European Union, which says Turkey must foster more freedom of expression as a condition of membership. Ms. Shafak, 34, is scheduled to give birth during the week the trial, set for Sept. 21, is to begin. She has been charged under a provision of Turkey's penal code that has been used against several journalists and authors. Ms. Shafak said that to date the article ''has never been used against fictional characters.'' ''In that sense this is a new step,'' she said, ''and it's quite surprising and upsetting, because if they keep doing this, no one can write novels in this country anymore; no one can make movies, even.'' In her novel, Armenian characters make disparaging comments about Turks and refer to the genocide of Armenians during the Ottoman Empire, a massacre denied by Turkey. Bush 'Assassination' Film Acquired for Wide Release Newmarket Films, the company that handled Mel Gibson's ''Passion of the Christ,'' has acquired the distribution rights to ''Death of a President,'' the provocative Gabriel Range pseudodocumentary that depicts the assassination of President Bush, Reuters reported. Newmarket is expected to give the film a wide release in the next few months. It was seen recently at the Toronto International Film Festival and is to be shown next month on Channel 4 in Britain. ''We portrayed the horror of assassination,'' said Mr. Range, who said he had received five or six death threats as a result of his movie, which has evoked protests from some conservatives. ''I don't think anyone would get the idea of assassinating Bush from this film.'' Accolades Britain will pay tribute to the Beatles in January when it issues a set of six stamps featuring album covers from their most famous recordings, above, the BBC reported.

The European Film Academy will honor Roman Polanski, 73, with its lifetime achievement award at ceremonies in December in Warsaw. Mr. Polanski's films include ''Chinatown'' and ''The Pianist,'' winner of the 2002 Academy Award for best director.

2006-09-13T00:00:00Z,"NOT too small and not too big, Chattanooga is really the undiscovered gem of Tennessee, where old-school Southern manners and grand Victorian mansions meet a thoroughly modern, eco-friendly Tennessee riverfront. You'll be called ''sir'' or ''ma'am'' everywhere, but 'noogans can have attitude to burn, too, like the wry bartender who showed the door to a wag yelling for ''Free Bird'' during a pub's original-music night. Chattanooga is a comfortable town, the kind of place where you can go high, at museums or the sculpture garden in the Bluff View Arts District, or low, at one of several kitsch attractions so bad they're good. It's somehow apt that Chattanooga's most famous citizen is Bessie Smith, the Empress of the Blues herself -- so, as she once sang, ''Baby, won't you please come home?'' Friday 5 p.m. 1) CITY ON THE TENNESSEE Walk downtown to Ross's Landing on the banks of the Tennessee River, where you'll find folks of all ages playing in the artificial waterfall that gently rolls down scores of steps. Seven large, elaborate Cherokee symbols adorn the walls and are decoded by plaques that tell of hundreds of years of the Cherokee Nation's history. Nearby, giant silvery tubes send jets of water arcing high in the air and down into the river. Where the boats dock, find a bench where it's quiet, and you might see a school of fish jumping as the mango sun begins to wane over Lookout Mountain. 7 p.m. 2) VITTLES AND DANCING Lick your lips at Sportsman's Bar-BQ (231 Signal Mountain Road, 423-265-1680), provider of cheap tasty thrills for Chattanoogans in the know since 1949. The outside looks like the kind of shack Jed Clampett lived in before he struck it rich in ''The Beverly Hillbillies.'' But inside, the barbecue is mouthwateringly good, with lean pork, chicken or ribs, with sweetly tangy sauce. Skip the so-so deviled eggs but not the hearty Brunswick stew. Afterward, work it off at the city's free Friday Nightfall summertime concert series at Miller Plaza, which features the rockabilly/R&B band Dave Alvin and the Guilty Men Sept. 15 and the Celtic group the Elders on Sept. 22 and closes with the soul singer Bettye LaVette on Sept. 29. Saturday 8:30 a.m. 3) UP LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN Just six miles from downtown, you can drive up the winding road that leads to the top of Lookout Mountain. Chattanooga, which means ''rock coming to a point'' in Muskogean, gets its name from this peak. Here you'll find Rock City (1400 Patten Road, 706-820-2531; www.seerockcity.com; $14.95), a 4,100-foot trail through boulders and over a wild, swinging 180-foot footbridge (don't look down), helpfully augmented by sculptures of fierce gnomes and fairy tale characters in grottolike caves, some creepily illuminated under black lights. At Lover's Leap, you'll see seven states, a waterfall and an improbably balanced 1,000-ton rock. Then drive over to the other side of the mountain to Ruby Falls (1720 South Scenic Highway, 423-821-2544; www.rubyfalls.com, $14.95), and, 1,120 feet underground, Ruby Falls Cave. The 145-foot waterfall pours down a vertical shaft highlighted by ruby-red spotlights and recorded trumpets. Noon 4) LIKE A KITCHEN IN MAYBERRY At Bea's (4500 Dodds Avenue, 423-867-3618), you just walk in and sit at a big table with a lazy susan in the middle, which you will share with whoever else happens to be sitting there, and wait for your server. She will arrive with any of 10 items, like huge plates of fried chicken, barbecue pork, pinto beans, fried okra and cherry cobbler, and place them on the lazy susan. And she will return, over and over again, until you tell her to stop -- because at Bea's, it's $9.75 for all you can eat. Bea's grandsons run the place now. You might even see a hometown celebrity there, like Samuel L. Jackson. 1:30 p.m. 5) CHATTANOOGA WOMEN At the African American Museum (200 East Martin Luther King Boulevard, 423-266-8658; www.caamhistory.com $5), you can pay homage to the blues legend Bessie Smith, born in 1894 in the city's long-gone Blue Goose Hollow section. This small collection, housed in a building where Smith performed in the days when it was a hotel, includes her writings, contracts, film clips and posters. Check out her black beaded dress from the Roaring 20's and marvel at her soul-searing voice, so powerful that it could be heard outside theaters in those days before microphones. Then walk north on Martin Luther King Boulevard to All Books (410 Broad Street, 423-266-0501), a used-book store where you can browse rare tomes about Chattanooga. While you're there, strike up a conversation with the opinionated owner and local historian, Polly Henry, and ask her about the day her sister spent with William Faulkner. 2:30 p.m. 6) REALLY HIGH ART Perched on an 80-foot bluff, the Hunter Museum (10 Bluff View, 423-267-0968, www.huntermuseum.org; $8) is the heavy hitter in the Bluff View Arts District. With the river and mountains as backdrops, you'll see a vast collection of American art, including that of the Hudson River and Ashcan Schools. Don't miss the River Gallery Sculpture Garden (free), next door, with its whimsical Jim Collins sculptures and surprises tucked around every turn. Hawks soar overhead as the Tennessee wends its way below. 4:30 p.m. 7) YOUR PET STURGEON All around the outside of the Tennessee Aquarium, billed as the world's largest freshwater aquarium (Ross's Landing, 800-262-0695; www.tennis.org; $17.95), artificial streams twist and turn and provide a refreshing chance to dip your tired feet. Inside the aquarium's River Journey building are 100-pound blue catfish to ogle and lake sturgeons you can actually pet, often to the subtle accompaniment of recorded bluegrass banjo music. In the Ocean Journey building, strategically placed white rocking chairs let you take a break and watch the world go by outside. 7 p.m. 8) BEYOND GRITS New York has wandered down to Tennessee -- specifically, to St. John's Restaurant (1234 Market Street, 423-266-4400), an upscale spot with a chef from the Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan, a knowledgeable but unobtrusive serving staff and fresh seafood flown in from all over. You can order ranch antelope with a cantaloupe chutney and stone-ground grits ($30), Hawaiian monchong fish ($25), seared Alaskan ivory salmon ($24) or strawberry pie ($8). It can be a bit quiet at St. John's, so if it's boisterous you want, go to the recently opened, buzz-worthy Blue Water Grille (224 Broad Street, 423-266-4200), with its lurid, Shaq-sized paintings of marlin and grouper and its fresh seafood from Florida (lump crab cakes, $10; lobster tacos, $10; jerk swordfish, $19). 9 p.m. 9) FROM ROADHOUSE TO RAVE With its wide-open, roadhouse feel, the most popular party venue in Chattanooga is Rhythm & Brews (221 Market Street, 423-267-4644; www.rhythm-brews.com; $12 to $15), where bands play bluegrass, blues, folk rock and other rocking regional styles. Afterward, head south to the Midtown Music Hall (820 Georgia Avenue, 423-752-1977, midtownmusichall.com; usually $5), where sports-bar types meet alt rockers, especially if the local alt-rock favorites Orange Julians are playing. Go light on the $4.25 mixed drinks: the bartender makes them strong. Finish the night at the intimate and hippie-ish Local (306 Cherokee Boulevard, North Chattanooga, 423-265-2171, $2 to $5), with the occasional rave night (they still have them in Chattanooga). Sunday 10 a.m. 10) THAT CHOO CHOO The old train station in town has been converted into a Holiday Inn (1400 Market Street, 800-872-2529 -- that's 800-TRACK-29; www.lookydaddy.com), where you can stay in old-fashioned sleeper cars. The kids can play engineer on a life-size (though, sadly, nonworking) model of the original Chattanooga Choo Choo steam locomotive. Take a ride on a creaky New Orleans trolley that rolls through a 25-minute tour of the 24 acres of train yards and hotel buildings ($2). Afterward, marvel at the Model Railroad Museum's elaborate display. The Basics If you're strapped for cash, check in at the quiet $37-a-night Microtel (7014 McCutcheon Road, 800-771-7171; www.microtelinn.com), near the airport. They throw in free Wi-Fi access and a Continental breakfast with pseudo-bagels and blueberry muffins. For a taste of the new Chattanooga, try the contemporary Chattanoogan (1201 South Broad Street, 800-619-0018; www.chattanooganhotel.com; $169 to $359). If you indulge in the indoor pool, whirlpool and spa, though, you may never get to see the sights. In the Fort Wood historic district, there's nothing quite like the Mayor's Mansion Inn (801 Vine Street, 423-265-5000, www.mayorsmansioninn.com, $125 to $275) bed-and-breakfast, especially if you want to immerse yourself in Victorian-era Chattanooga. The lush but poorly lighted Laurel Falls Suite boasts a 300-gallon marble tub and fireplace. Breakfast downstairs is elegant and plentiful. In a sitting room at the front of the house, find the window with the bullet hole from the early 1900's and ask to hear the story (or legend) about the lovers' quarrel that ended in tragedy."

Adored husband of the late Pamela Richards Smit, beloved father of Tyn, Michiel, Guy and Marijke, and brother of Johan Smit. Wim was born on August 25th, 1930 in Utrecht, the Netherlands. He joined the faculty of the University of Utrecht after receiving his doctorate in history there in 1958. In 1965, Wim joined the Columbia University faculty as the Queen Wilhelmina Professor of the History of the Low Countries. He was a widely recognized authority in the social, religious, cultural, and economic history of early modern Europe. While he wrote prolifically in his earlier career, Wim became most renowned for his dedication to teaching and was a friend and mentor to countless students, particularly through teaching all four of Columbia's Core Curriculum courses. In 1984, the Columbia College Student Council presented Smit with the Mark Van Doren Award for Great Teaching, and in 2003, he was a co-recipient of the first award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum. Smit was a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, served on the Governing Board of Columbia's Society of Fellows in the Humanities and was consulting editor for the Records of Civilization series published by Columbia University Press. Wim was also an avid piano player and lover of music, as well as a prolific cook, cyclist, and, in his earlier years, semi-professional soccer player. Smit most relished his role as husband, father, and mentor. His legacy lives on in the hearts and minds of the thousands of students, colleagues, and friends who had the honor to know him and learn from him, over the years. A memorial service for him will be held on campus at St. Paul's Chapel at 5pm on Monday, September 18, 2006."

The Times article said that the groups and their employees had consistently failed to disclose the donations, and it said in the first paragraph that the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research was one of them. But a Manhattan Institute author had told The Times that he had indeed disclosed contributions from the Walton Foundation in an article he wrote, a fact that should have been included in the Times article. The article also reported that Tim Kane of the Heritage Foundation and Karl Zinsmeister, formerly of the American Enterprise Institute, were among those who wrote articles favorable to Wal-Mart after their foundations received a donation. Both those groups were called for comment for the Times article. Mr. Kane, who was not called, subsequently said that he did not know about the Walton Family Foundation contribution and that he had criticized Wal-Mart's call for a higher federal minimum wage in an article he wrote. The Times also did not ask Mr. Zinsmeister to comment, but he declined to do so when reached after the Times article was published.

They needed a victory over the Florida Marlins and a doubleheader sweep by Atlanta against Philadelphia. Charlie Samuels, the Mets' equipment manager, made sure the clubhouse was stocked with the obligatory celebration Champagne, and a sense of anticipation filled the air. But any Mets celebration was short-circuited early when Philadelphia erased a five-run deficit to defeat the host Braves in their first game, 6-5. That left the Mets looking to lower their number to clinch the division to two games. It took 11 innings, a wild pitch and an error by the Marlins, but the Mets salvaged something from the day, winning, 7-4."

Gotti, with prosecutors saying that Mr. Gotti&#8217;s claim that he quit the Gambino crime family in 1999 was no more than a scheme to avoid a long prison sentence. Miriam E. Rocah, a federal prosecutor, said that Mr. Gotti, left, devised the plan while in federal prison from 1999 to 2004 on unrelated racketeering charges. Mr. Gotti&#8217;s defense is that he retired from the Mafia before mid-July 1999, a time frame that would protect him from prosecution because of the five-year statute of limitations on the racketeering charges. But the government contends that Mr. Gotti had known that his prison conversations with visitors at Ray Brook federal penitentiary were being recorded, and that was why Mr. Gotti told people that he wanted to leave &#8220;the life&#8221; behind him."

2006-09-15T00:00:00Z,"WATCHING a freestyle rap on television or in a documentary can be daunting. The lyrics, delivered by top talent, seem so witty and flow so freely that it's hard to imagine they can be what they are -- unscripted and delivered off the cuff. But aspiring rappers (or M.C.'s) have places to go, too. Freestyle rap has evolved, and while the underground freestyle hip-hop circuit is still a place where top M.C.'s hone their skills, there are also plenty of events where amateurs can ''spit'' lyrics or ''battle'' just for fun and local respect. A weekly Tuesday battle at the Apache Cafe in Atlanta usually draws about 300 people to watch as up to 16 people get onstage and battle. A panel judges the contestants on best lyrics and delivery. The event's founder, Andre Lett, is a purist who strictly enforces the rule that participants not recite prewritten lines. Anyone caught doing so is banned. ''We know when it's freestyle and when it's written,'' Mr. Lett said. Those who dispute a ban can contest it in Mic Club Court."

2006-09-15T00:00:00Z,"The jazz avant-garde has always been a multinational affair. Its early explorers sought inspiration from European as well as African and Far Eastern sources; its audience base stretches across borders, as does its economic infrastructure. So it should not be altogether shocking that one of the most vibrant record companies on the scene is based in Lisbon. What the ascent of Clean Feed Records illustrates is just how fluid the global exchange has become. Established in 2001, the label counted 40 stylishly designed titles in its catalog within four years, as well as a physical space in Lisbon -- Trem Azul, Portuguese for Blue Train -- that doubles as a record shop and performance loft. Next week Clean Feed will present a minifestival, not in Portugal but in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where many of the artists on its roster reside. Each night at Barbès will feature three bands in roughly hourlong sets. Tuesday's program begins with Transit, a quartet led by the drummer Jeff Arnal, and goes on to feature groups led by the bassist Ken Filiano, with Tony Malaby and Michaël Attias on saxophones; and the saxophonist Steve Lehman, with John Hebert on bass and Gerald Cleaver on drums. On Wednesday Mr. Attias, who often books Clean Feed artists in a weekly series at Barbès, will perform with a sextet before ceding the spotlight to the trombonist Joe Fiedler and the trumpeter Dennis Gonzáles. Thursday appears to be the most lyrical evening of the run, with chamberlike ensembles led by the accordionist Will Holshouser; the saxophonist Rodrigo Amado, on loan from Lisbon; and the guitarist Joe Morris (above).

Though this sounds dangerous, she is no stranger to fear; she spent the early years of her life in refugee camps after her parents were forced to flee Poland during World War II. These days she carves monumentally scaled wooden sculptures, several of which are on display at Galerie Lelong, showing concurrently with ''Mad. Sq. Art: Ursula von Rydingsvard,'' an outdoor exhibition of four of her sculptures at Madison Square Park (above). She cuts and carves imposing semiabstract forms from sweetly aromatic cedar wood beams stacked and glued together into towering piles. The designs are intuitive and improvised, though they will often recall treasured domestic items from her childhood: bowls, cups, a comb. Sometimes she finishes the sculptures with graphite powder to give them a burnt look, but more recently she has been leaving them rough, dimpled and bare, paying attention to the natural, lightly textured wood surfaces. Such are a pair of colossal wall-mounted plates at Lelong, measuring 10 feet high and several feet wide. The surface detailing is at once ragged and delicate, the artist letting her power tools run amok.

A collection of rare live telecasts of musicals are being presented from the 1950's, that bygone era when television executives actually cared about Broadway. (The Tony Awards show hardly counts). ''Wonderful Town'' -- believe it or not -- was once in the CBS lineup, and a production starring Rosalind Russell is among the five shows preserved on kinescopes presented as part of the New York Musical Theater Festival.

The charges were contained in a letter dated Sept. 12 and sent to Rep. Peter Hoekstra, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the committee. Its unclassified staff report, released in mid-August, was widely seen as an effort to prod American intelligence agencies to be more aggressive in their examination of Iran's nuclear program, amid charges from some conservatives that the mistakes made in assessing Iraq's programs four years ago had bred an overly cautious atmosphere."

He said membership in NATO would be submitted to a referendum once the country had undergone political and economic reforms. Analysts and NATO officials said Mr. Yanukovich's statement should not be interpreted as a sign that Ukraine was being pulled back into Moscow's orbit or distancing itself from the West.

2006-09-15T00:00:00Z,"The Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron were selected yesterday to design a new $208 million home for the Miami Art Museum in Museum Park on Biscayne Bay. Terence Riley, the museum's director, said of the architects' work in a telephone interview yesterday: ''Every project is a step forward. Every one is an innovation. There is no cookie cutter. There are no repeats.'' The firm's latest projects have included the new de Young Museum in San Francisco, which opened last October, and the Walker Art Center expansion in Minneapolis, completed in April 2005. The museum's Architecture Research Committee considered the work of 75 architects and visited 26 buildings in 5 countries. Mr. Riley recommended Herzog & de Meuron at a public meeting yesterday at the museum, after which a civic panel endorsed the choice. Mr. Riley, who took over in March, was previously chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art. Miami's public was included in the process because $100 million of the project's costs will be covered by bonds approved by voters in 2004. The rest will be raised by the trustees. The museum hopes to complete the project late in 2010. ROBIN POGREBIN"

2006-09-15T00:00:00Z,"Diner's Guide presents excerpts from recent restaurant reviews. Trestle on Tenth Extending the recently formed restaurant row on 10th Avenue another few dozen feet to the north, Trestle on Tenth serves rebelliously hearty and sometimes seductively homey fare that reflects the Swiss upbringing of its chef and owner, Ralf Kuettel. On a concise menu with standouts like saddle of lamb, veal kidneys and pork loin, there were a few too many disappointments, but Mr. Kuettel, who knows wine, has put together a list of affordable, adventurous selections from small producers, most of them European. It's a model of what a restaurateur without tons of money or storage space can do. 242 10th Avenue, at 24th Street, Chelsea; (212) 645-5659, trestleontenth.com. Dinner entrees, $18 to $25. * [Rating: One Star] Japonais An offshoot of a restaurant already established in Chicago and bound for Las Vegas, Japonais inhabits a genre of glossy, gargantuan Asian-fusion extravaganzas that has gone from plump to morbidly obese in no time flat. That doesn't mean it and its Japanese-French cooking aren't enjoyable at times. A riff on Peking duck was wonderful, as were some of the sushi rolls. But the kitchen's performance was erratic, the service was often off-key, and the whole production is familiar to anyone who's spent time in Morimoto, Ono, Nobu 57 and so many other peers. Anyone who hasn't may well find Japonais enchanting. 111 East 18th Street, Manhattan; (212) 260-2020. Sashimi, sushi and sushi rolls, $3 to $38; entrees, $26 to $58. * [Rating: One Star] Felidia Lidia Bastianich's celebrity (television shows, books) goes far beyond this terrific restaurant, which helped set her on her path. But the enduringly splendid Istrian and northern Italian food at Felidia shows that she isn't neglecting her roots. Felidia excels at game, organ meat, risotto and pasta dishes that showcase slow-cooked sauces using fatty meats. This is big stuff, and the best of it commands attention without groveling for it, hitting a midpoint between regal and rustic that's all its own. The wine list, emphasizing northern Italy, is great. 243 East 58th Street, Manhattan; (212) 758-1479, felidia.lidiasitaly.com. Dinner entrees, $25 to $36; pasta, $20 to $30. *** [Rating: Three Stars] Sip Sak Many of the best dishes from the chef Orhan Yegen aren't on the menu at this plain but comfortable Turkish restaurant with sunshine-colored walls. You have to know to ask for the shavings of lamb gyro over sautéed cubes of pita in a yogurt sauce. Or for the Turkish pizza, which is really Syrian pizza. Or the special lamb sausage. And if you do ask for them, you can have a superbly flavorful, satisfying experience, despite the unfilled water glasses, no-reservations policy and meager wine list. Otherwise, you'll encounter peaks (manti in a garlicky yogurt sauce) and valleys (dry chicken kebabs) in equal measure. 928 Second Avenue, at 49th Street, Manhattan; (212) 583-1900, www.sip-sak.com. Entrees, $9.50 to $17.50. * [Rating: One Star] What the stars mean: (None) Poor to satisfactory; * Good; ** Very good; *** Excellent; **** Extraordinary."

Presented by Primary Stages (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. Broadway 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FOGGY BOTTOM' James Armstrong's comedy about a Washingtonian who seduces women by promising them green cards has a nice sense of the ridiculous, but sometimes the action is unbelievable, even by the standards of farce (2:00). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444.(Anita Gates) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman) 'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) * 'SEVEN GUITARS' (2:45). Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) 'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'I 3/5sheart 4/5 KANT' Keith Urban's nimble, knowing one-act is about four women (a graduate student, a heroin addict, a depressive and a bombing victim), the men in their lives and the little humiliations and unexpected certainties of daily existence (1:10). Linhart Theater at 440 Studios, 440 Lafayette Street, near Astor Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates) Spectacles 'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims for a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles. It's the main event at the Spiegeltent, a vintage European tradition visiting South Street Seaport this summer (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette) 'REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP-SHOPPING' Reverend Billy (a k a the performance artist Bill Talen) struts and preaches his way across the Spiegeltent stage accompanied by a choir and a fine seven-piece band. Radical political theater has rarely been more thoughtful or fun (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (George Hunka) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). 2005 New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE HISTORY OF VALENTYNE AND ORSON' The director and puppet maker Ralph Lee makes a royal steed out of a hobby horse and a ferocious bear from cardboard and baseball mitts in this enchanting tale of a young prince and the ''wild man'' he befriends (1:05). The outdoor garden of the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 929-4777; closes on Sunday. (Miriam Horn) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ACCEPTED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A clever slacker and his oddball crew invent a phony college in this passable example of that oxymoronic genre, the Hollywood comedy about sticking it to the man. (Nathan Lee) 'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (A. O. Scott) * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 (2:20)minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis) 'BARNYARD' (PG, 88 minutes) The barnyard animals in this crude 3-D animation walk, talk and party down like human beings. Way too often the male ''cows,'' as the film calls them, also flash their udders. (Dargis) 'BEERFEST' (R, 110 minutes) In ''Beerfest,'' a gaseous celebration of binge drinking and family honor, the five comedians known collectively as Broken Lizard head for Munich and an underground beer-guzzling contest. Best viewed while sloshed, the movie is idiotic, tasteless and irrepressibly good-natured: in other words, a frat-house classic. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, ''Boynton Beach Club'' is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Stephen Holden) 'A CANTOR'S TALE' (No rating, 95 minutes) Jovial, rotund and prone to impromptu bursts of song, Cantor Jacob Mendelson has dedicated his life to preserving the Jewish liturgical music known as chazzanut. Erik Greenberg Anjou's charming documentary is more concerned with singing praises than arguing over orthodoxies, while interviews with an uncharacteristically subdued Jackie Mason and Alan Dershowitz suggest an awareness that they're in the presence of greater voices. (Catsoulis) 'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt-putt-putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis) 'The Celestine Prophecy' (PG, 100 minutes) A delectable fusion of New Age babble and luridly bad filmmaking based on the best-selling book by James Redfield. (Dargis) 'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis) 'THE COVENANT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) The director Renny Harlin proves that ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' was not the nadir of his career with this thriller about boy witches fending off a nefarious transfer student. (Lee) 'CRANK' (R, 83 minutes) A poisoned hit man rampages in Los Angeles, doling revenge on his nemesis and misanthropy on all. Basically a broken-down retread of ''Speed,'' with Jason Stratham as the bus. (Lee) 'CROSSOVER' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Bling is bad, and friends are good in this story of temptation, rivalry and cheerleaders, set in the world of Detroit street basketball. (Lee) * 'THE DESCENT' (R, 99 minutes) A total horror freakout from the British writer and director Neil Marshall about six women on a caving expedition who meet their fears and some scary monsters, too. (Dargis) 'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott) * 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis) * 'Half Nelson' (R, 107 minutes) In their beautiful bummer about the relationship between a white teacher (Ryan Gosling) and a black student (Shareeka Epps), the gifted young director Ryan Fleck and his writing partner, Anna Boden, offer a lament for the radical fires of the 1960's and a suggestion for life and politics after the new left. (Dargis) * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden) 'HOLLYWOODLAND' (R, 126 minutes) A fictional look at the life and downward-spiraling times of George Reeves, the man who played Superman on television and is here played by a fine Ben Affleck. Allen Coulter directs Paul Bernbaum's screenplay, which features a dead-end parallel plot about a detective (Adrien Brody). (Dargis) 'HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS' (PG, 98 minutes) The worms go in, the worms go out, but mostly the worms go into the frying pan in Bob Dolman's engaging and yucky adaptation of the Thomas Rockwell book. (Dargis) * 'HOUSE OF SAND' (R, 115 minutes, in Portuguese) Beautifully shot in a sandy, remote corner of northern Brazil, this film tells the story of three generations of women, all of them played by Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres, mother and daughter in real life and two of the national treasures of Brazilian cinema. (Scott) 'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis) * 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden) * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott) 'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. While Disney piles on the uplift, the director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis) * 'LASSIE' (PG, 100 minutes) Everything old is new again in the 11th film about the beloved pooch with the I.Q. of a grad student and the instincts of a boomerang. Blissfully restored to the period and location of Eric Knight's original novel -- pre-World War Britain -- the movie balances humor and pathos with old-fashioned charm and not a trace of satire. Progressive adults may balk at the film's ultimate capitulation to the power of patronage, but tykes will just be happy that Lassie has come home once more to the multiplex where she belongs. (Catsoulis) 'LE PETIT LIEUTENANT' (No rating, 110 minutes, in French) A tough, satisfying drama from Xavier Beauvois about an alcoholic Parisian detective (Nathalie Baye) and the young lieutenant (Jalil Lespert) who comes under her wing. (Dargis) 'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis) * 'MAN PUSH CART' (No rating, 87 minutes) The Sisyphean daily grind of a Pakistani immigrant who sells coffee, doughnuts and bagels from a cart in Midtown Manhattan is an exemplary work of independent filmmaking carried out on a shoestring. At its best, it suggests an American ''Bicycle Thief.'' (Holden) * 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. Three intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott) 'MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND' (PG-13, 110 minutes) A shaky comedy from the director Ivan Reitman, in which ''Fatal Attraction'' meets ''Wonder Woman,'' by way of Uma Thurman, Luke Wilson and some sexist she-devil clichés, some funny, others not. (Dargis) * 'MUTUAL APPRECIATION' (No rating, 110 minutes)Andrew Bujalski's wonderful independent film about friendship in the modern world looks like something that came out of a time capsule, but there's nothing dusty about it. Shot on expressively grainy black-and-white celluloid, it is the sort of unassuming discovery that could suffer from too much big love, and while it won't save or change your life, it may make your heart swell. Its aim is modest and true. (Dargis) 'PAPER DOLLS' (No rating, 80 minutes, in Hebrew, English and Tagalog) A small, touching documentary about Phillipine transexuals living in Israel. (Scott) 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' (PG-13, 151 minutes) Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott) 'THE PROTECTOR' (R, 84 minutes, in Thai) A provincial Thai warrior rampages through Australia, busting skulls and shouting, ''You stole my elephants!'' in this infectious B-movie smackdown. (Lee) 'QUEENS' (No rating, 107 minutes, in Spanish) A dithering but generous Spanish farce, ''Queens'' follows the forthcoming nuptials of three gay couples by focusing on their overbearing mothers. While the sons dance, bicker and fret over antiques, the mamas express their discomfort with the wedding plans by seducing inappropriate men. Despite obvious nods to Pedro Almodóvar, ''Queens'' is notable only for its unadulterated worship of middle-aged women. (Catsoulis) * 'QUINCEAÑERA' (R, 90 minutes) This portrait of a Mexican-American family living in a Latino neighborhood of Los Angeles is as smart and warm-hearted an exploration of an upwardly mobile immigrant culture as American independent cinema has produced. (Holden) 'RED DOORS' (No rating, 90 minutes) This agreeable, lightweight movie, written and directed by Georgia Lee, turns the malaises of a dysfunctional suburban Chinese-American family into a bittersweet farce that teeters between cheeky humor and surface pathos. (Holden) 'RIDING ALONE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES' (PG, 108 minutes, in Mandarin) Zhang Yimou takes a pause between marital-arts extravaganzas with this simple, affecting melodrama about a mournful Japanese patriarch on an odyssey through rural China. (Lee) 'Satellite' (No rating, 100 minutes) In this captivating romantic fairy tale for grown-ups, made on a shoestring, two young lovers in New York flee yuppie hell into a life of petty theft. (Holden) * 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis) 'SHERRYBABY' (No rating, 96 minutes) This story of a young woman, just released from prison, trying to put her life back together, is somewhat predictable, but well observed by Laurie Collyer, the writer and director, and beautifully realized by Maggie Gyllenhaal in the principal role. (Scott) 'SNAKES ON A PLANE' (R, 105 minutes) Snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson. David R. Ellis provides the fine B-movie-style direction, while Mr. Jackson supplies the cool and his trademark epithet. (Dargis) 'STEP UP' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Ever since Kevin Bacon's rebellious hips ignited a small-town uproar in ''Footloose,'' the modern high school romance has placed a premium on rhythm. In ''Step Up'' a rough Baltimore kid (Channing Tatum), armed only with a killer smile and hip-hop moves, falls for a classically trained dancer (Jenna Dewan). Bland but likable, the movie fashions social equality from big musical numbers. If ballet and hip-hop can coexist, it asks, why can't we all be friends? (Catsoulis) 'TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Fast, fun and silly, with Will Ferrell as a Nascar driver, Sacha Baron Cohen as his nemesis, and a new course record for product placements per gallon. (Scott) '13 Tzameti' (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French New Wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden) * 'THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED' (No rating, 97 minutes) Kirby Dick, with the help of a private detective, investigates the mysterious workings of the Motion Picture Association of America, a highly secretive, deeply irrational organization with enormous influence over what we see -- and don't see -- on movie screens. (Scott) 'TRUST THE MAN' (R, 101 minutes) A strained, flatulent relationship comedy about two couples, from the writer and director Bart Freundlich. With Julianne Moore, David Duchovny, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Billy Crudup. (Dargis) * 'ANDY WARHOL: A DOCUMENTARY FILM' (No rating, 4 hours with an intermission) Ric Burns's absorbing four-hour critical biography of this seminal Pop artist is devoted to the proposition that Warhol was the greatest artist of the second half of the 20th century, as Picasso was in the first. It makes a mostly persuasive, highly entertaining case for that claim. (Holden) 'the WICKER MAN' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In remaking a 1973 British horror classic, Neil LaBute once again demonstrates his misogyny and, worse, his technical incompetence. (Scott) * 'WORLD TRADE CENTER' (PG-13, 129 minutes) From Oliver Stone, a return to the emotions of 9/11. Powerful and almost unbearably moving.

Ms. Atlas, born in Belgium to Jewish and Muslim parents, with family ties to Morocco and Egypt, is a natural multiculturalist. In a strong, sensuous voice, and with the help of bubbly electronic beats, she brings North African, Middle Eastern and Indian styles together; her newest album, ''Mish Maoul'' (Mantra), throws in some rap too.

(Chinen) LUCIANA SOUZA: BRAZILIAN DUOS (Through Sunday) Luciana Souza, a vocalist raised in São Paolo, has made some of her most beguiling music in this format, joined by a lone acoustic guitar. Romero Lubambo, the guitarist, is more than an accompanist; providing intricate counterpoint and rhythmic undertow, he is Ms. Souza's equal.

(Chinen) * MCCOY TYNER TRIO WITH PHAROAH SANDERS (Tuesday through Thursday) The pianist McCoy Tyner and the tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders are indelibly associated with the 1960's output of John Coltrane, though each enjoyed a productive period as a solo artist in the 70's and beyond. They combine their searching energies here in a quartet with Charnett Moffett on bass and Eric Kamau Gravatt on drums. (Through Sept. 24.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $45 at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) WILLIAMSBURG JAZZ FESTIVAL (Through Sunday) This grass-roots affair, which briefly subsumes a small swatch of Brooklyn with modern jazz, hits full stride this weekend, with notable performances at Laila Lounge (the trumpeter Ralph Alessi, tonight at 11); Galapagos (the cellist Dana Leong, tomorrow night at 8, and the trumpeter Maurice Brown, tomorrow night at 10); and Rose Live Music (the singer Gretchen Parlato, tomorrow night at 10, and the pianist Jason Lindner, tomorrow night at midnight). The festival closes, oddly enough, on the Lower East Side, at Tonic (the saxophonist Sabir Mateen with the festival's organizer, the trumpeter Jesse Selengut, Sunday at 8 p.m.). Times and locations vary; full schedule, fullcircledrumming.com/wjazzfestival. (Chinen) * CASSANDRA WILSON/CHRISTIAN SCOTT (Wednesday) A jazz singer by training and temperament, Ms. Wilson takes obvious pleasure in a boundless, genre-blind repertory, a tendency borne out vividly on her most recent album, ''Thunderbird'' (Blue Note). It's a recording with the seamless sensibility of a modern studio concoction, but Ms. Wilson, often a deeply magnetic performer, should be able to carry it off in concert. The opener is Christian Scott, an excellent young trumpeter whose recent debut, ''Rewind That'' (Concord), signaled his intention to explore a modern funk-based sound. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $45 and $35. (Chinen) STEPHANE WREMBEL (Sunday) Virtually every Sunday night for the last three years, Mr. Wrembel, a French guitarist, has been playing the music of the Gypsy guitar hero Django Reinhardt at Barbès. This Sunday Mr. Wrembel marks his anniversary at the club with three sets, loosely tracing the chronological arc of Mr. Reinhardt's career. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow and Thursday) Updated to the years around World War I, this is one of New York City Opera's best productions, and some fine young talents should make this run of it worth hearing. Shu-Ying Li, the Mimi, has shown a really striking soprano on past occasions; James Valenti, her Rodolfo, was a promising Met Council winner in 2002; Elisabeth Caballero, the Musetta, made a very good City Opera debut last season; and Daniel Mobbs, the Marcello, has been proving himself reliably at Caramoor and elsewhere for several years. George Manahan, the company's music director, conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $125. (Anne Midgette) 'CARMEN' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Rinat Shaham, who made her company debut as Zerlina, is a small singer for Carmen; but worse, City Opera's production seems to have veiled her spark, rendering her a mere stereotype in a stiff performance. Her Don José, Mark Duffin, has warm lower notes and a pressed, often flat sound on top; the Escamillo is Adrian Gans, who was too nervous to be judged at his company debut in the role. The high point is Latonia Moore, a radiant-voiced Micaëla who seems to belong to a world apart from this rather pedestrian production. Ari Pelto conducts, a little woodenly but competently enough. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $130. (Midgette) 'THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Diminutive and beloved, the sexaguanarian Amato Opera proves that, in opera, tradition and devotion can prevail over quality. It's remarkable that all of Mozart's characters can fit on the theater's tiny stage. Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Midgette) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Solo piano recitals frame the week's offerings at New York's favorite floating concert hall. Tonight Steven Lubin offers three Beethoven sonatas (including the ''Waldstein'' and ''Appassionata''); next Thursday Steven Beck juxtaposes Bach and Shostakovich preludes and fugues, then plays some Mozart sonatas. In between, the Quartetto di Cremona shows its stuff in two varied programs tomorrow and Sunday, featuring Shostakovich, Schubert, Mozart, Schumann and Vacchi. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday afternoon at 4; Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35; $20 for students; $30 for 65 tonight and Thursday. (Midgette) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Thursday) The season begins with a generous program ranging as far back as Vivaldi and Mendelssohn and as far forward as Bright Sheng, Leon Kirchner and Nicholas Maw. Pieces by John Ireland and Arthur Bliss will also show up. At 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $70. (Bernard Holland) 'THE CONSTITUTION: A SECULAR ORATORIO' (Tonight and Thursday) Those who celebrate Constitution Day should not miss the composer Ben Yarmolinsky's word-for-word setting of large swatches of the Constitution, modeled on a Handelian oratorio but with echoes of musical styles from classical to American folk. This being Constitution Week, it will have two separate performances. Tonight at 8, General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen, 20 West 44th Street, (212) 921-1767; $15; $10 for members; $5 for students. Thursday afternoon at 12:15, Gould Memorial Library Auditorium, Bronx Community College, University Avenue and 181st Street, (718) 289-5100; free. (Midgette) * ENSEMBLE XX.JAHRHUNDERT (Monday through Wednesday) Call it old new music: the 20th-Century Ensemble has been devoted to contemporary and modern works since the conductor Peter Burwik founded it in 1971. At the Austrian Cultural Forum's continuing ''Mostly Modern'' festival, the ensemble brackets its three performances next week with works of the Second Viennese School (Webern and Berg) and émigré composers (Eisler and Krenek); these surround a range of works by living composers, many Austrian, and many unfamiliar to New York audiences. At 8 p.m., 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, Ext. 222; free, but reservations are required. (Midgette) TAKA KIGAWA (Tonight) This enterprising young Japanese pianist tackles another tough program, this time with Bach, Beethoven and Boulez. At 8, Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 242-4770; $10. (Holland) 'A NIGHT AT THE OPERA' (Tuesday) A host of singers from the New York City Opera's past and present, including Samuel Ramey and Carol Vaness, will parade their vocal talents across the stage of the New York State Theater. At 7:30 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $27 to $135. (Holland) ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Monday) The Metropolitan Museum opens its music season with hearty, traditional fare in the Great Hall. Janine Jansen and Eriko Sato are violinists in Bach's D-minor Double Concerto and will also be busy in excerpts from Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons.'' At 7 p.m., (212) 570-3949; $60. (Holland) St. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Wednesday) In its first full season of concert programs after the impressive expansion of its campus, the Morgan Library and Museum gets things going at its intimate new Gilder Lehrman Hall with the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble. Booking this popular ensemble into this 280-seat hall has proved a smart move. There are two series with three programs each; the first is officially sold out, and there is limited availability for the second. The programs begin with a concert of Baroque works by Bach, Vivaldi and Handel. At 7:30 p.m., 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 594-6100; $35; $25 for members.(Anthony Tommasini) * SILK ROAD ENSEMBLE YOUNG ARTISTS (Tomorrow and Sunday) As part of the continuing Silk Road Project, Yo-Yo Ma's mission to bring together musicians of diverse cultures from the ancient international Silk Road trade routes, Carnegie Hall and the Weill Music Institute present four programs this weekend that grew out of a ''Tradition and Innovation'' workshop for composers and young artists. The concerts offer works by emerging composers like the 28-year-old Angel Lam, who was born in Hong Kong and now lives in Baltimore, and by established figures like Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky, one of the leading voices in Uzbekistan, as well as the acclaimed Argentine composer of Eastern European Jewish heritage, Osvaldo Golijov. The specific works on each of the four programs will be announced at the concerts, chosen from composers including Gabriela Lena Frank, Christopher Adler, Kayhan Kalhor, Jeeyoung Kim, Evan Ziporyn and others. Tomorrow and Sunday at 4 and 8 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800; $15. (Tommasini) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. ARTICHOKE DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) The company will perform Lynn Neumann's new ''I Am Nothing (Without You): Rounds 1-6,'' which involves the audience in determining the structure of each performance of the piece, which can be seen from perspectives that include the sidewalk outside. Through Sept. 24. At 8 p.m., Center for Remembering and Sharing, 123 Fourth Avenue, between 12th and 13th Streets, East Village, (212) 352-3101; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Jennifer Dunning) MARIANA BEKERMAN DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) Created by Mariana Bekerman and the guest choreographers Keiko Fujii and Rebekah J. Kennedy, ''Taro'' tells the story of a woman whose world is transformed when she encounters an evil spirit. (Through Sept. 24.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning) BROOKLYN ADULT RECORDER CHOIR (Tonight and tomorrow night) The name of this group turns out to be literal description rather than whimsy: a self-described ad hoc group of some 60 performers trying to recapture the joys of those painful recorder lessons at school during ''In the Closet, Again, Again.'' The choreographer Beth Gill and the composer Chris Peck thought this up. From 7 to 10, the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $15, or pay what you will for Queens residents. (Roslyn Sulcas) DANCE AT MILLER: NEW BALLET CHOREOGRAPHERS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ashley Bouder, Maria Kowrowski and Wendy Whelan are among the wonderful dancers from the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater Studio Company who will perform in this enticing program of new ballets to live music by the Masada String Trio. The choreographers are the City Ballet soloists Edwaard Liang and Tom Gold, and the former Ballet Theater dancer Brian Reeder. Mr. Gold is the wild card here -- the other two have budding reputations as promising ballet choreographers -- but he is in very good company. At 8, Miller Theater at Columbia University, 116th Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $35; Columbia students, $7; non-Columbia students and Guggenheim Museum members, $21. (Sulcas) DANCENOW/NYC FESTIVAL: DANCEMOPOLITAN @ JOE'S PUB (Tonight and tomorrow night) In the festival's closing performances, Leigh Garrett serves as host for two different programs featuring 19 choreographers and companies. At 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200 or joespub.org. Information about participants: dancenownyc.org; $20. (Dunning) BILL T. JONES/ARNIE ZANE DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday) Bill T. Jones's ''Another Evening: I Bow Down,'' which had its premiere earlier this year, is back in the New York area forone night. The music is by Mr. Jones's regular collaborator Daniel Bernard Roumain, performing with the Bronx hard-core band Regain the Heart Condemned. An actor, Andrea Smith, performs alongside 10 dancers. Mr. Jones appears too -- always worth the trip. At 8 p.m., Mason Gross Performing Arts Center, Rutgers University, 85 George Street, New Brunswick, N.J., (732) 932-7511, masongross.rutgers.edu; $15 to $25. (Sulcas) * LARRY KEIGWIN (Sunday and Tuesday) An expanded version of Mr. Keigwin's amusing contribution to the first (2005) installment of Dancing in the Streets's ''Dance Charrette,'' complete with dancers gabbing into cellphones and walking on walls. Sunday at 1:30 and 5 p.m., and Tuesday at 6 p.m., rain or shine, Tobacco Warehouse, Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park section of the Brooklyn Bridge Park, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (212) 635-3505 or dancinginthestreets.org; free. The Sunday performances will flank a walking tour of the Brooklyn Bridge Park area at 2:30 p.m., sponsored by the Municipal Art Society, (212) 935-2075; $15. (John Rockwell) NOÉMIE LAFRANCE'S 'AGORA II' (Tonight, tomorrow, Wedneday and Thursday) Apparently Ms. LaFrance, a tireless artistic explorer of public space, is a glutton for punishment. Having moved bureaucratic mountains last year to stage ''Agora'' in the enormous (and empty) McCarren Park pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she now has a sequel, ''Agora II,'' which incorporates a number of guest companies and is described in the publicity materials as ''a choreographic game for 1,000 bodies.'' Good luck to them all. At 8 p.m. (arrive by 7:30), McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street, between Driggs and Bayard Streets, (718) 388-6309 or sensproduction.org; $20 and $30. (Sulcas) LIVE ARTS FESTIVAL AND PHILLY FRINGE (Tonight and tomorrow night) These festivals wind to an end this weekend at theater spaces throughout downtown Philadelphia with several intriguing-sounding events, among them Jeb Kreager's ''Contest,'' which explores an American cultural preoccupation with competition and victory in choreography that draws on marching bands, platoon drilling and group singing. Information and reservations: (215) 413-1318 or livearts-fringe.org; $10, $15 and $20, depending on the event, with some shows free. (Dunning) * CONSTANZA MACRAS (Thursday) This choreographer, born in Argentina, trained in New York and Amsterdam and based in Berlin, will perform with her 18-member international company, Dorky Park, in the United States premiere of ''Back to the Present,'' originally presented over four hours in 2003 in an abandoned Berlin department store. (Through Sept. 23.) At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or dtw.org; $20; $12 for artists, members, students and 65+. (Rockwell) MÉXICO NOW @ DNA (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mexican choreographers living in New York City will present their work. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, ticketcentral.com; $17. (Dunning) MÉXICO NOW: Danscores by OFELIA LORET DE MOLA (Tonight and tomorrow night) Although ''Aktun Spukil,'' the title of a work by the choreographer Ofelia Loret de Mola, sounds like one of the crew on the Starship Enterprise, it is, according to Mexican lore, the name of a group of caves in which the Maya took shelter during battles. At 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $15; students, $12. (Sulcas) ELISA MONTE DANCE (Tuesday through Thursday) This company, well known to New Yorkers, opens the Joyce's fall season with a weeklong celebration of its 25th anniversary. Elisa Monte has created a new piece, ''Hardwood,'' and has revived some older works for the occasion. At 7.30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $40; Joyce members, $30. (Sulcas) JEREMY NELSON (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Nelson will continue his investigation into physical turbulence in his new ''Mean Piece,'' a work for six dancers, with sets and costumes by Luis Lara Malvacias. At 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or dtw.org; $12. (Dunning) NEW YORK BAROQUE DANCE COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Last month Mark Morris offered a new piece called ''Mozart Dances,'' set to Mozart piano music, none composed for dance. Now Catherine Turocky's historical-dance company and its affiliated early-music group Concert Royal will present their own program, ''Mozart Dances!'' Here the music will again include a piano concerto, but also Mozart's actual dance music for ''Les Petits Riens'' and the opera ''Idomeneo.'' At 8 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, (212) 307-4100 or (212) 355-6160 or nybaroquedance.org; $30. (Rockwell) ELKA RINDFLEISCH (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday) In Ms. Rindfleisch's new ''Damage,'' six dancers will struggle through a spreading inner disturbance to rock music by Chris Woltmann, performed live. They end up nowhere, the choreographer says, or in places of unexpected tenderness in a set that fills the performance space with small alternative spaces. At 8 p.m., Wallabout Studio, 50 Taaffe Place, between Flushing and Park Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (917) 251-4561 or rindfleischdance.com; $15. (Dunning) T E A DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday night) Sahar Javedani and Ella Ben-Aharon, the troupe's resident choreographers, will present their new ''Gardens,'' which probes the notion of the pre-apple Eden as a metaphor for purity. At 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) YUBIWA HOTEL (Tonight and tomorrow night) In its American debut, this all-female modern-dance and performance company will examine the Japanese woman today, focusing on girlhood in ''Candies: girlish hardcore.''

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums BARD GRADUATE CENTER: ' LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE,' through Oct. 15. Aquamanilia sounds like the latest perfume or sorbet, but actually refers to the small, cunningly figurative medieval vessels used for ritual hand-washing. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper-alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show has been drawn mostly from the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and overseen by the head of the museum's medieval department and its object conservator in collaboration with Bard graduate students. But don't worry about dryness. The aquamanile's triple function as totem, prestige object and pitcher lends it an undeniable energy. (The serpents are handles.) The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art; a versatile repertory of incised details and patterns; and a continuing, rarely resolved struggle between form and function. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, www.bgc.bard.edu. (Roberta Smith) Brooklyn Museum: 'Looking Back from Ground Zero: Images from the Brooklyn Museum Collection,' through Dec. 27. This show, drawn entirely from the Brooklyn Museum's collection, presents a historical picture of Lower Manhattan from early on to the present, with the building of the World Trade Center as the pivotal point. A short film, ''Building the World Trade Center,'' produced by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1983, is an invaluable document of the triumphalist spin surrounding the construction of the complex. A small selection of artworks produced in or just after 2001 hints at the profound and conflicted feelings the destruction of the twin towers has evoked. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, New York, (718) 638-5000, www.brooklynmuseum.org.(Holland Cotter) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedeker's guides, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. And Church's oil sketches alone are worth the price of admission: exquisite, plainspoken Emersonian love poems to New York and New England. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 or ndm.si.edu. (Michael Kimmelman) * Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org. (Smith) Dia:Beacon: 'Agnes Martin: A Field of Vision: Paintings from the 1980's,' through March. Dia:Beacon, a bulwark of Minimalism on the banks of the Hudson River north of Manhattan, has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin. Over the last two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. The fourth installment is now in place. If Martin's spare, lucid compositions of drawn lines and painted bands feel different from much of the art around them here, that is because she was not a Minimalist. In fact, she called herself an Abstract Expressionist, and she was adamant on this point. The 18 paintings here confirm her conviction, in a show as deep, light-glinting, restless and purposeful as the river flowing nearby. Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, www.diacenter.org. (Cotter) Guild Hall Museum: 'Elizabeth Peyton,' through Oct. 22. Most of the 43 works in this exhibition portray beautiful people, some famous, some less so. Most immediately engaging is the tension between the painterly abstraction and the human subject matter. Images are realized in drippy swatches, squiggly lines and feathery dabs, and colors range from incandescent reds and oranges to pale lavenders and grays to dark velvety browns, blacks and purples. Yet for all that expressionistic action, likenesses are exacting. People like Nicole Kidman and Queen Elizabeth are rendered with seemingly effortless precision. Romantic feeling connects the form and content in Ms. Peyton's work. A kind of erotic yearning animates how Ms. Peyton sees her subjects and how she makes her pictures. To paint, her works imply, is to be in love: to be in love with certain people and with painting itself. 158 Main Street, East Hampton, N.Y., (631) 324-0806, www.guildhall.org/museum.ihtml. (Ken Johnson) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestoes and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Brush and Ink: The Chinese Art of Writing,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then ''Brush and Ink: The Chinese Art of Writing'' at the Metropolitan Museum is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, www.metmuseum.org. (Cotter) Morgan Library & Museum: CELEBRATING REMBRANDT: ETCHINGS FROM THE MORGAN, through Oct. 1. On the occasion of the opening of its newly rethought home, the Morgan Library has mounted a show of 50 of its greatest Rembrandt etchings. The selection demonstrates the range of the master's subjects (from the heights of biblical tragedy to the casually erotic) and also his amazingly expressive technique. It serves as reminder that Rembrandt's prints represent genius of the plainest, most accessible sort: sustaining classics that encompass the earthy and the exalted and offer fresh meanings with each encounter. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, www.themorgan.org. (Smith) * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org. (Smith) NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer, through Oct 9. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: Had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, www.neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman) * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, www.nyhistory.org. (Cotter) Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Nadine Robinson: Alles Grau,' 'Quid Pro Quo: Rashawn Griffin, Karyn Olivier and Clifford Owen: 2005-06 Artists-in-Residence,' and 'Beyond Sight,' through Oct. 22. The Studio Museum in Harlem is looking sharp with three concurrent shows, the outstanding one being a single big sound-sculpture by Nadine Robinson. It expands her political purview from imperialism to Armageddon with hundreds of speakers embedded in an 11-foot-high gray-black wall unit that generate a sampling of satanic film scores (''The Omen,'' ''The Matrix''), mixed with funeral chants and Rastafarian dance music. ''Quid Pro Quo'' is a showcase for the 2005-6 artists in residence, all interdisciplinarians with a sweet-and-sour Dadaist touch. Mr. Owens, with performance, looks intriguingly volatile; he will give a live performance at the museum tonight (reservations suggested). And you won't want to leave the museum without checking out ''Beyond Sight,'' the work of the 14 teenage participants in the program called ''Expanding the Walls: Making Connections Between Photography, History and Community,'' 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, www.studiomuseuminharlem.org. (Cotter) Wadsworth Atheneum: 'American Splendor: Hudson River School Masterworks From the Wadsworth Atheneum,' through Dec. 31. Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt,, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, www.wadsworthatheneum.org.(Grace Glueck) Galleries: Uptown * ONE WAY OR ANOTHER: ASIAN AMERICAN ART NOW, through Dec. 10. Taking its name from a 1978 hit by the punk band Blondie, this lively exhibition finds a new vitality and freedom, especially where identity is involved, in Asian-American art. The artists' roots range from Iran to Korea; their mediums include painting, drawing, sculpture, video, photography and performance. Keep a special eye out for Mari Eastman's wryly beautiful paintings; Mika Tajima's glamorous deconstruction of Minimalism; and the video-performance efforts of Patty Chang, Laurel Nakadate and Xavier Cha. An added bonus: 12, or 71 percent, of the show's 17 artists are women. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, www.asiasociety.org. (Smith) * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea * STUART HAWKINS: CUSTOMS The latest series of daffy photographs by this American artist working in Nepal rarely reflects well on Western tourists. Too stagy to be snapshots and too haphazard to be completely planned, they parlay familiar travel terms like ''Day Driver,'' ''Field Notes,'' ''Welcome Drink'' and ''Medicine Kit'' into bizarre sitcoms. In ''Souvenir,'' a short video about the search for indigenous authenticity, the ensemble performance that is generated in the photographs becomes openly antic and wonderfully pointed. Zach Feuer Gallery, 530 West 24th Street, (212) 989-7700, www.zachfeuer.com, through Sept. 23. (Smith) Other Galleries 'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, www.flcart.org through Oct. 16. (Johnson) Last Chance * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, www.folkartmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, www.frick.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) * GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES This well-known Cologne gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-7100, www.metropicturesgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 or www.jewishmuseum.org, closes on Sunday. (Glueck) Katonah Museum of Art: 'Andromeda Hotel, the Art of Joseph Cornell,' Although Cornell never left the United States, he translated his dreams of faraway places into delicate, sometimes overly precious works that have a sense of longing. In this show the white-painted, weathered interior of a box titled ''Grand Hotel -- Hotel Taglioni'' (1954) contains incongruous elements of collage, among them an old ad for a French bakery topped by a color cutout of the ballerina Marie Taglioni, an object of the artist's adoration. Even simpler, but equally dreamy, is another weathered box, ''Hotel de l'Étoile'' (1950), which holds only a long, vertical image of a deep blue sky rife with thousands of tiny pinpoints of light. One of the show's most striking images is a surreal photograph of Cornell by Lee Miller in which he is seen gazing upward, entranced, his shoulder adorned with a miniature sailboat (around 1935). Route 22 at Jay Street, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-9555, www.katonahmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck) HANS RICHTER (1888-1976), DADA; ART AND ANTI-ART This daunting yet partial survey is clogged with late paintings and reliefs that are for the most part elegant pastiches of Constructivism, Cubism and Abstract Expressionism. But it should be seen for the four short films from the 1920's, in which Richter's formalist and Dada sides balance beautifully, with elegantly Surrealist results. This is especially the case in the luminous ''Ghosts Before Breakfast,'' from 1927, which explores most of film's structural possibilities and segues briskly between abstraction and Hollywood narrative, while three skittering bowler hats provide continuity. Maya Stendhal Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, www.mayastendhalgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * STRANGE POWERS This exhibition vacillates between the hokiness of spirit photography and the immateriality of Conceptual Art with just enough agility to keep you guessing about whether ghosts, ESP and other paranormal phenomena are matters of fact or faith. Among the more convincing indications are Anne Collier's small color photographs of the auras of her friends; Sophie Calle's video documentary (made with Fabio Balducci) of a psychic-guided journey; and the Center for Tactical Magic's ''Vital Psigns,'' which demonstrates the power of positive thought on plants. But the efforts of nearly 20 other artists round out the argument, often to unsettling effect. Creative Time, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 206-6674, www.creativetime.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)"

Mr. Friedman practiced law for over 50 years in New York, California, and Florida. Sy Friedman spearheaded a number of voting rights cases including Rosario v. Rockefeller, which resulted in the US Supreme Court decision that abolished restrictions on voter registration. Sy Friedman was also a respected legal visionary. He was an early champion of allowing cameras in the courtroom and permitting jurors to take notes during proceedings. As a jurist, he became nationally known for his decision recognizing the rights of pet owners in Corso v. Crawford Dog and Cat Hospital.

Instead of worrying about what hot club to attend or getting a table at the trendiest restaurant, maybe they should actually watch some movies like the rest of us."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"YOU may have noticed that it was a banner year for chipmunks. This spring brought forth torrents of the chubby-cheeked rodents, scurrying up drainpipes, darting through stone walls, undermining shrubs, perennials and masonry with the brio of Brooklyn's mightiest tunnel sandhogs. The terrain around house and garden took on the perils of a prairie dog village, with ankle-spraining sinkholes every few feet. For the first time, I saw chipmunks scampering higher than squirrels in the pin oaks, doing greedy reconnaissance on the bird feeders below. This year's furry tide turned our middle-aged beagle, Maybelle, into a pup again. She stalked, dug, yipped and pounced herself into tiptop physical form. She has never caught a chipmunk in seven years of trying. They dart between her legs and chatter tauntingly from just beyond the perimeter of her electric dog fence. Sheer numbers increased her odds of bagging one this season. But suddenly, in early August, she gave up the chase. Heaving herself onto the sunny deck with a great sigh, she lay resigned, watching the wee marauders with the gimlet eye of a defeated old general surveying a superior ground force."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"ON BEAUTY, by Zadie Smith. (Penguin, $15.) Smith pays homage to E. M. Forster's ''Howards End'' in this beautifully observed novel about two contrasting interconnected families. Howard Belsey teaches at Wellington, a fictional college town outside Boston, and is married to Kiki, an African-American. When Howard's rival -- a reactionary Trinidadian scholar named Monty Kipps -- moves his family to Wellington for a visiting professorship, the Belseys and Kippses square off in ideological and personal combat. Smith creates vivid portraits of the Belseys' teenage children -- including a son who falls hopelessly in love with Monty's beautiful daughter -- and takes an irreverent look at campus politics. Last year ''On Beauty'' was a finalist for the Man Booker Prize and was named one of the year's 10 best books by the Book Review. ''Some fearless outside referee had to barge in and try to adjudicate the culture wars,'' Frank Rich wrote here, ''so let us rejoice that it's Zadie Smith.''"

''His nimbleness really stands out on film,'' Mangold said of Wilfork, who outweighs him by 25 pounds. Wilfork, a third-year pro, has played in 33 N.F.L. games and started 23. Mangold, below, a rookie center out of Ohio State, is making his second start. ''You can tell he can read schemes well,'' he said. ''It's going to be a battle out there.'' JONATHAN VILMA VS. TOM BRADY There is a reason Brady has won his last six games against the Jets and is 8-1 against them. ''He is such a good quarterback at reading defenses,'' Vilma said. Brady completed only 11 passes in a victory against Buffalo last week, but two of those went for touchdowns. Vilma and the other linebackers -- Victor Hobson, Eric Barton and Bryan Thomas -- must work as one to make the pocket uncomfortable for Brady. KAREN CROUSE"

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"FALLACI--Oriana. Rizzoli International Publications mourns the death, on September 15, 2006, of a fearless and controversial writer. Born in Florence, Italy and politicized from a very early age by her anti-Fascist father, Oriana Fallaci began a career in journalism as a teenager, and often discussed her participation in the Resistance during WWII. As a war correspondent, Oriana Fallaci covered the greatest conflicts of her time including Hungary, Vietnam, Latin America, Mexico, the Middle East, and the Persian Gulf. Known for her piercing interviews with world leaders and celebrities, Oriana Fallaci's subjects included Henry Kissinger, the Ayatollah Khomeini, the Shah of Iran, Yasser Arafat, the Dalai Lama, Golda Meir, Indira Gandhi, Federico Fellini, and Walter Cronkite, among many others. Author of many works of fiction and non-fiction, Oriana Fallaci's last two books, ''The Rage and the Pride,'' and ''The Force of Reason,'' expressed her fury at what she defined as the post-9/11 failure by Europe and the United States to deal appropriately with Islamic Fundamentalism, a position that incited both considerable support and lawsuits accusing her of racism. Ill for over ten years, Oriana Fallaci fought her brutal disease with the same fierce passion that defined her as a woman, and as a journalist and author."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"Mozart: Symphonies Nos. 40 and 41, 'Idomeneo' Ballet Music Les Musiciens du Louvre, conducted by Marc Minkowski. Deutsche Grammophon Archiv B0006506-02; CD. WHEN the period-instrument movement made its first major incursions into the Mozart symphonies, in the late 1970's (after sporadic earlier skirmishes), the goal was to recapture the weight and timbre of the late-18th-century orchestra as Mozart knew it. That aim engendered angry debate then; today it is such an entrenched expectation that modern orchestras have adopted the movement's ideas about scale and weight."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"THE borough may need some extra help, but at least it's not a laughingstock. After some residents warned that cash-strapped Ringwood would be ridiculed by late-night television hosts if the borough turned down $500,000 in so-called extraordinary aid from the state, as had been proposed, the Borough Council voted 5 to 2 Tuesday night to take the money after all. It will be part of the $14.2 million municipal budget for 2006."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"I have spent the past year filming model school-food programs around the country for a documentary called ''Two Angry Moms'' (Lisa Belkin, Aug. 20). While most districts I've visited haven't been able to perform controlled double-blind studies, there is unanimous agreement that better school food correlates to higher test scores, improved attendance, fewer nurse visits, increased focus, better behavior, fewer discipline call-outs and even dramatic improvements in athletic performance -- all goals that educational policy strives to achieve. Amy Kalafa Weston, Conn. How many parents have received a note from school reminding them to feed their child a hearty, nutritious breakfast on standardized-test day? School leaders clearly understand the connection between a healthy meal and higher test scores. Why then, is it so difficult to understand the connection between year-round better school food and improved cognition, behavior and short- and long-term health? Nancy Huehnergarth Chappaqua, N.Y."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"The start of a new school year has brought nothing but more problems for the Roosevelt school district. The district, which has been under state control for the last four years because of substandard student performance and fiscal difficulties, has uncovered more financial problems. Earlier this month, when the district closed its financial books for the 2005-6 school year, its new business manager, Stanley Bronski, uncovered a deficit that was at first estimated to exceed $5 million for a budget of $67.6 million. That has since been recalculated to $4.3 million, said Tom Dunne, a spokesman for the State Education Department."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"Authorities in Newark, piecing together the events that led to a triple homicide in the Vailsburg neighborhood over Labor Day weekend, have arrested one of the three suspects. The suspect, John Wessels, was arrested Tuesday as he arrived for work as a mover, said the Essex County prosecutor, Paula T. Dow. He was being held in the Essex County Jail on $2 million bail."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"For his first collection of men's wear, Isaac Mizrahi unzipped tradition with a new take on proportion control. Pump up the volume with a parka, Mizrahi says, but offset its bulk with narrow pants, as demonstrated above. ''I let proportion dictate,'' says the designer, whose collection -- available exclusively at Bergdorf Goodman -- is rich in decadent fabrics and Savile Row-inspired details like silk linings and zippered interior pockets. Mizrahi's mantra for this effort is ''careful, considerate, careful, considerate,'' and his gems of wisdom, above, are words to dress by. Jonathan S. Paul"

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"Although Maria Bartiromo, the television and magazine business journalist, is the subject of a cover story on balancing work and life in the second issue of Success magazine, she readily concedes she hasn't achieved this balance. ''I can't say I have mastered that work-life balance -- my life has been so much about work,'' she said at a party at Elaine's in New York last week celebrating her photo on the magazine's cover."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''Who's Killing Long Island Sound?,'' by Tom Andersen (Op-Ed, Sept. 3), could not have been better timed. As beaches along the coast closed to swimming on Labor Day weekend, many people were reminded that clean water is not a luxury. It is a necessity. The Clean Water Fund makes our waterways suitable for fishing and swimming. The region has made progress in fulfilling its promise of restoring Long Island Sound by 2014, but it has begun to break that promise."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"Not only are children moving back home after college and asking Mom and Dad for monthly subsidies, but in a growing number of states children can now stay on their parents' health insurance plans well into their 20's. Call it another example of adultescence. With 18- to 34-year-olds the fastest growing group of uninsured, states are extending the time that children can be a dependent for insurance purposes."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"Neil Rolnick: 'Digits' Kathleen Supové, pianist; Peter Eldridge, vocalist; Paul Dresher Electro-Acoustic Band. Innova 656; CD. THE four recent works by Neil Rolnick on this disc draw on the oversize gestures of Liszt's piano music, the introspective figuration of Robert Johnson's blues guitar, song forms and avant-garde theater. That's a broad expanse, but the thumbprint that runs through these scores is Mr. Rolnick's manipulation of timbre and gesture."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"FOR the first few Wednesdays after her husband died last month, Marie Dandrea skipped the evening rosary services scheduled at the shrine they had founded on the farm here where he was born -- a stark white stucco and steel triangle that pierces the sky like a sailboat blown far inland. She visited daily, but not at the one time when she knew that 200 other worshipers would also be visiting, praying to St. Padre Pio. ''Eight o'clock Mass, then to the cemetery to see Petey, then here,'' she said, meaning her husband of 53 years, Pete Dandrea. ''But not on a Wednesday. I just couldn't do it.''"
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"GUNDLACH--Robert, 90. Well-known New York set designer and member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, died on August 8, 2006, after a brief illness in Mitchellville, MD, where he had lived for four years at The Collington Retirement Community. His diverse career encompassed movies, television, and theatre. He also had been a Vice-President and Trustee of The United Scenic Artists, New York Local 829. Survivors include his wife of fiftyone years, Marguerite (Maggie Brown) Gundlach, of Mitchellville; a son, David Brown Gundlach, of Pearl River, NY, and two brothers, Wiliam Gundlach (Captain U.S. Navy retired), of Chapel Hill, NC, and Richard Gundlach, of Staten Island, NY."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"In mountain climbing, unlike social climbing, it's better to blaze your own trail. Take the pioneering alpinist Steve House, who last year forged a new 13,500-foot path up the Rupal Face of Nanga Parbat (nickname: the Maneater) in Pakistan. A native of Oregon, House, 36, has been climbing all his life and has endured rock falls, illness, excruciating weather and exhaustion; he once climbed nonstop for two and a half days. All the while, he's maintained a certain utilitarian chic, thanks in part to a Patagonia sponsorship. ''When you're 25 and living in a truck and making $10,000 a year, a new jacket is a big deal,'' he says. Now he's fairly indifferent to making a fashion statement. After all, his greatest achievement, he jokes, is surviving. PAUL L. UNDERWOOD"
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"PART of his annoyance stems from his years of commuting in Europe, which prides itself on high-quality public transportation. There is also his belief that any business should strive for a clean, professional appearance. Whatever the reason, Benjamin Heckscher Jr. says the source of his aggravation is the terrible condition of Connecticut's trains and their stations."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"THIS school district has been changing, house by house, as Orthodox Jewish families have flocked here over the last two decades, gradually at first and then in growing numbers. While not yet a majority, the Orthodox have nonetheless emerged as the dominant force in a clash of cultures. And the front line in this battle is Lawrence's once highly regarded public school system."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"CECILE LINDSTEDT cares so much about how the downtown looks in this village along the Hudson that for years she has led a volunteer effort to plant shrubs and flowers along Main Street. But when dogs, which were being curbed by their owners, started to kill the plants, she decided last month to post more than 25 laminated signs along the street, telling residents where the pets could and could not go. The signs are rather direct. One says, ''Dogs Pee Here,'' with a picture of a dog raising a leg; another shows a squatting dog with a red slash through the picture."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I read with interest the article ''When Pet Friendliness Has Its Limits'' (The Hunt, Sept. 3). When we were buying our West Side co-op, we told the broker that we had a big dog. She said, ''Don't worry, it is a pet-friendly building.'' When we filled out the application for the co-op board where it said, ''any pets'' we put, ''1 dog, a Bouvier des Flandres.'' True to the broker's words, at the board interview, nobody asked any questions about the dog."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"Chicago Connection A story line leading into 2005 was how the new Bears wide receiver MUHSIN MUHAMMAD, above, would connect with quarterback REX GROSSMAN. The relationship did not materialize; Grossman was injured yet again and Muhammad failed to record a single game with more than 100 yards. Last week was a different story: Grossman found Muhammad six times for 102 yards. Muhammad will try to prove it was not a fluke today against the Lions, a team with a defense known for big plays and inconsistency. Room for Improvement Dolphins quarterback DAUNTE CULPEPPER had a poor first game with his new team, and his two interceptions brought back memories of his awful 2005. But coming off a major knee injury, and facing the Steelers, a Super Bowl-winning defense, Culpepper did throw for 262 yards. Facing off today against the Bills, who last week surrendered two passing touchdowns to the Patriots, who do not have a major receiving threat, Culpepper will look to connect with the solid targets CHRIS CHAMBERS and MARTY BOOKER. Hot Potato Famous for demanding the ball while with the Jets, KEYSHAWN JOHNSON, above, is suddenly the centerpiece of an offense he had no intention of leading. The Panthers, who were a top contender going into the season, struggled last week with Johnson replacing the injured STEVE SMITH as the top receiver. If the Panthers are to avoid an 0-2 start, Johnson and quarterback JAKE DELHOMME will need to prove they don't need the speedy Smith. Defensive Stoppers Coach Jim Mora Jr. had the Falcons' defense in fine form last week against the Panthers, and the defense gets another chance to shine against the Buccaneers, who failed to record a point against the Ravens. Even without defensive end JOHN ABRAHAM, who is listed as questionable for the game, the Falcons should be able to contain CHRIS SIMMS, a major disappointment last week."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"WATSON--John W. On September 1, 2006. Retired from NYNEX, John's civic-minded dedication included working at Keewaydin Camp in Salisbury, VT, caring for and feeding the homeless in NYC, and advocating for peace and justice.

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"For a long time Rialto Pictures has been reliably restoring old movies and, even better, exhuming films from obscurity. Recently the company has made lost French policiers something of a specialty, introducing American audiences to neglected masterworks like Henri-Georges Clouzot's ''Quai des Orfevres'' and Jean-Pierre Melville's ''Cercle Rouge,'' two films that never had a proper theatrical opening in the United States. Earlier this year Rialto released another Melville gem, ''ARMY OF SHADOWS,'' a dark, suspenseful World War II drama from 1969. Using some of the conventions of film noir to create an atmosphere of anxiety and menace, Melville probes the logistical and moral predicaments of a small group of resistance operatives, who work in secret and in constant fear of betrayal. Unlike most other postwar reconstructions of the fight against the Nazis, ''Army of Shadows'' offers no inkling of eventual triumph; its characters pursue a just cause that for all they know is also doomed to fail. Melville's style is deliberate and absorbing; his images seem to have not only depth but weight as well. And LINO VENTURA, as his world-weary protagonist, expresses the burden of his duties -- which include killing treacherous comrades as well as enemies -- in every nuance of posture and facial expression. SIMONE SIGNORET was never better. If you didn't get to ''Army of Shadows'' the first time around, don't miss it when it returns to Film Forum on Wednesday for a two-week engagement. 209 West Houston Street, west of the Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110. The film will also be shown through the end of the year at theaters around the country. A schedule is at rialtopictures.com.)"

IN THE UNIVERSE OF FINE WATCHES, time moves slowly. Serious European collectors and a growing cadre of wrist-conscious Americans concern themselves exclusively with watches powered by a spring technology invented over 300 years ago. If it needs a Duracell, a watch snob isn't interested. To keep matters simple, the vital parts in a watch are called the movement. But it's the quest for super-intricate movements that makes the watch world tick. If car nuts count horsepower, the horologically obsessed count complications: mini-mechanical performances like chiming on command or tracking the earth's orbit (which, incidentally, can fuel astronomical prices at auction). To draw attention to these goings-on, watchmakers back the watch case with a clear crystal pane, opening a window on the workings of time. Curiously, even the most expensive of these wonders may never be as accurate as a battery-powered Swatch. But then, what else is there in life but time and irony? Credits for the watches on these pages appear on Page 162. Fashion editor: David Farber. Set stylist: Megan Caponetto."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"The ''LAW & ORDER'' franchise starts its 17th season on NBC this week with a raft of new faces but, as usual, a minimum of sentiment. For the first time on the original ''Law & Order'' (Friday, 10 p.m.), Lieutenant Van Buren and Assistant District Attorney McCoy both start a season with new minions -- Milena Govich as a freshly promoted detective with a lot to prove, Alana De La Garza as McCoy's sixth hottie subordinate -- and little breath is wasted mourning the characters they replace. Dennis Farina's Detective Joe Fontana gets one mention in passing, and Annie Parisse's poor A.D.A. Alex Borgia, stuffed into a trunk in last season's finale, doesn't even rate that. Over at ''Law & Order: Criminal Intent'' (Tuesday, 9 p.m.), Jamey Sheridan's James Deakins gets just as little respect: Eric Bogosian materializes as the new captain, makes a few snide remarks about the eccentric methods of Detective Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) and they're off to the races. But on ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' (Tuesday, 10 p.m.), where the character played by the recently pregnant Mariska Hargitay is only going away for five episodes, the producers are kinder: Detective Olivia Benson gets the central role in the season opener as well as a handy plot twist to explain her imminent absence. Viewers saddened by the temporary separation of Benson and Christopher Meloni's Detective Stabler on ''S.V.U.'' can turn to PBS's ''MYSTERY'' (Sunday, check local listings), where the latest ''Inspector Lynley'' series is on view.

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"American museums have been so occupied for the last few years with matters far from home, among them the call for greater coverage of Islamic culture, that they have often passed over domestic themes and issues. One of these is the situation of Native American artists in the contemporary art world, the subject of a fun and intriguing, but not entirely successful, exhibition at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Conn. Usually such exhibitions herd together disparate artists with any amount of Native American blood in their veins, the idea being that the appellation belongs to anyone who claims the ancestry. So it was reasonable to expect that the artists in ''No Reservations: Native American History and Culture in Contemporary Art'' would be descendants, no matter how remote, of American Indians, Eskimos or Aleuts."

The first major arrival in the wash of European choreographers and dancers to hit our shores this season will come on Thursday, with the Argentine-born, New York- and Amsterdam-trained, Berlin-based choreographer CONSTANZA MACRAS. At Dance Theater Workshop Ms. Macras will offer the American premiere of ''Back to the Present,'' her first work for her company, the 18-member international Dorky Park. The work was originally seen in 2003 as a four-hour site-specific spectacle in a derelict Berlin department store and was retooled for the stage the following year. Thursday through Saturday at 7:30 p.m., 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or dtw.org; $20.

Iwas lucky enough to meet Steinem some years ago when she introduced Ms. magazine, and I found her to be surprisingly friendly and generous with her time. It's obvious from her responses to your reporter's questions that she has lost none of her brilliance. Who else couldso accurately and cogently delineate the ethos of both Hillary Clinton and the flawed Condoleezza Rice? I wish her well in her new radio venture. Michael Maxtone-Graham New York Did Gloria Steinem need to diminish Condoleezza Rice because she doesn't share her political views? Isn't the whole idea behind feminism about women thinking for themselves? This is a woman whose goal is to be the commissioner of the National Football League. How Ms. can you get? Ruby Whitman Ossining, N.Y. Steinem does nothing to promote women as a whole, only to reassert sets of categories like ''woman'' or ''African-American'' and their relationship to contrived political ideologies. Condoleezza Rice, though I do not personally agree with her on many issues, does a service to women and men alike by her sheer success in transcending such categories and by epitomizing the original goal of feminism: that a girl should be able to grow up and be whatever the hell she wants to be. A more pointed question for Steinem: Can an old dog learn new tricks? Kelly D. Cook Ithaca, N.Y."

The exhibition, at the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum in New Brunswick, concentrates on the years just after the end of World War I up to 1922-23, when the artist began making the Constructivist-inspired abstract and geometric paintings and designs for which he is known."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"Art books aren't easy to display because an open page in an exhibition vitrine, squinted at through glass, gives only a hint about what a whole text and its illustrations are like. Books want to be held, read, thumbed through. So people tend to stroll past them in exhibitions where there is much else to see, as there is in ''CÉZANNE to PICASSO,'' the show that just opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Devoted to the French dealer AMBROISE VOLLARD (1866-1939), it includes a gallery of illustrated books, two-thirds of the way through, where a visitor's patience and feet may start to flag. Resist the fatigue. Mr. Vollard made his reputation, and a stupendous fortune, selling Cézannes and Gauguins around the turn of the century. This provided him with the comfort and means to do what he really wanted. In 1900 he published ''PARALLELEMENT'' by PAUL VERLAINE, with its erotic illustrations by BONNARD that float through the text. Bonnard's women and Verlaine's musing on religion and sexual perversion scandalized the French minister of justice, who demanded the work be recalled. Now, as it should be, it's a landmark in book design. ''LE JARDIN DES SUPPLICES,'' by Octave Mirbeau, has equally remarkable color lithographs by RODIN. The story describes a dissolute Frenchman abroad in the Far East. He has an affair with a beautiful Englishwoman, who takes him to a prison with a garden where the flowers bloom from the blood and excrement of torture victims. Torture (Mirbeau goes into great detail and variety) functions as an erotic stimulant, inspiring Rodin to create swimmy, sensuous illustrations of women. Publishers, mindful of the recent scandal over ''Parallelement,'' naturally wanted nothing to do with the book. Except for Vollard, who persuaded Auguste Clot, the great printmaker, to reproduce Rodin's designs, which are so lovingly made that they look like original watercolors.

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"Way back in 1970 Neil Young wrote ''Southern Man,'' about the South's heritage of slavery and racism. Lynyrd Skynyrd replied in 1974 with ''Sweet Home Alabama,'' telling Mr. Young ''Southern man don't need him around'' and putting the message across with rock-ribbed guitar riffs. And in 1996 along came the DRIVE-BY TRUCKERS to heal the rift between Southern rock and liberalism and, incidentally, to merge Mr. Young's style of high-register vocals with brawny Southern-rock guitars. The Drive-By Truckers' songs are steeped in the particulars of Southern life: the farms and the churches, the shotguns and the beer bottles, but also the Wal-Marts and drug users. ''It gets so hard to keep between the ditches when the roads wind the way they do,'' they once sang. Their albums, like the unabashedly ambitious ''Southern Rock Opera'' and the thoughtful, twangy ''Decoration Day,'' sketch grand epics or pack short stories into four-minute songs. The Drive-By Truckers aren't doctrinaire liberals but populists with an eye on working-class predicaments, from stagnant wages and layoffs to the toll of war. With a three-guitar front line, the Drive-By Truckers love redneck music but not redneck assumptions, and they work as hard and steadily as the blue-collar characters in their songs: regularly putting out albums and constantly touring. This year they released their seventh album, ''A BLESSING AND A CURSE'' (New West), which sets aside the historical for the personal, including family memories and stormy love songs.

People are fishing much the way they have for decades.

On a trip three to four miles off-shore late last month, he spent much of his time denouncing some politicians and what he says are senseless regulations that in the past 10 years have been ruining the recreational fishing industry. When not piloting the boat or talking with his customers, he was on his cellphone planning strategies that he hopes will save the industry."

Behind the News -- The company still faces legal inquiries related to the investigation, in which surreptitious methods were used to obtain phone records of directors and reporters. But the board shake-up seemed to restore order in a company that has long set a standard for corporate behavior in Silicon Valley. Investors seemed satisfied as well: Hewlett-Packard's stock is at a five-year high. WORLD BANK The News -- Paul D. Wolfowitz, the head of the World Bank, has come under criticism within and outside the bank for a campaign against corruption in developing countries. Behind the News -- Mr. Wolfowitz's efforts have led to the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of loans. Critics say under his approach lending may be shut off in an arbitrary way, jeopardizing the bank's goal of reducing poverty. But the criticism may also reflect lingering doubts about the selection of Mr. Wolfowitz, a neoconservative who as deputy defense secretary was a primary architect of the Iraq war. WAR ON TERROR The News -- Colin L. Powell, President Bush's former secretary of state, sided with some Republican senators in opposing the president's proposals for the trial and interrogation of terrorism suspects. Behind the News -- Mr. Powell said the president's plan, which provides fewer protections for suspects, would encourage nations to question the ''moral basis of our fight against terrorism.'' It was a rare public disagreement by Mr. Powell. But he had long expressed reservations about White House claims it should not be bound by the Geneva Conventions in the war on terror. SPORTS The News -- Frankie Andreu, a former teammate of Lance Armstrong, admitted he had used performance-enhancing drugs. Behind the News -- The admission by Andreu and another anonymous former teammate that they had used the drug EPO in 1999, the first year Armstrong won the Tour de France, put pressure on the cycling star, who has said he never used banned substances. But both teammates said they did not see Armstrong use drugs, and Armstrong said he had never pushed his teammates to use them and had not known they had done so. THE ENVIRONMENT The News -- A new study showed that global warming is responsible for the rising ocean temperatures in tropical regions that spawn destructive storms. Behind the News -- The report found that the rising water temperatures could only be explained by the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The study did not address the issue of whether recent hurricanes have been stronger because of the warmer waters, but the researchers warned that continued warming might mean stronger storms in the coming decades."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"HEEREN--Aimee de Sa Sottomaior, died at home Wednesday morning, of complications following pneumonia, aged 103. Mrs. Heeren was born in Castro in the Province of Parana, Brazil. When they were still in their teens, Aimee and her sister Vera accompanied their parents to Rio De Janeiro, where the family settled. Aimee was married young to a distant cousin, Luis Simoes Lopes, the right hand man to President Getulio Vargas. The couple lived at the presidential palace. The marriage lasted for only a few years. Then, the two sisters, who by then were exotic beauties, arrived in New York and immediately caused a stir due to their charm and originality. In 1941, Aimee met and, later in the year, married Rodman Heeren, the son of Fernanda Wanamaker of the Philadelphia department store dynasty, and of Spanish diplomat Arturo Hereen. Shortly after Rodman Heeren returned from the Pacific, where he served with the U.S. Army, the couple moved to Europe, establishing a base in Biarritz, France, from where they traveled frequently. Aimee, who had received only a basic education in Brazil, but armed with an all-consuming desire to learn, went about collecting friends among aristocrats, intellectuals, and artists who offered her their wisdom and experience. Very quickly she learned to speak six languages, not perfectly, but well enough so as to enable her to move around society in a spectacular manner. Initially, she was admired for her beauty and her charm, but soon she became known for her elegance, on one hand, and on the other for her graciousness as a hostess and for her talent in creating exquisite decors within her homes. She was elected to the Best Dressed List and later was admitted to the Fashion Hall of Fame, not just for adhering to fashion but more for reinterpreting it with originality and taste. She was the epitome of glamour. Rodman and Aimee maintained homes in Biarritz, New York, and, later Palm Beach, houses which illustrated the development of her refined taste in decorating. In her later years, her good health and extraordinary energy allowed her to lead an active life, surrounded by friends of all ages. She was generous towards her friends and relations, especially towards those who were less privileged than she was. Undoubtedly she was one of the last grand dames, and she will leave an imprint on her era. She is survived by a daughter, Cristina Noble, and her granddaughter Victoria Noble. Mrs. Heeren will be buried in Palm Beach following a Religious Service at St. Ann's Church at 310 North Olive Ave, West Palm Beach, on Monday September 18th at 10:30 a.m. On Thursday, September 21, a memorial service will be held at St. Ignatius Loyola Church on Park Ave. and 84th St. at 4:30 p.m. Flowers are welcome and so are donations to Voices for Children Foundation, 1500 NW 12th Ave., Suite 1117, Miami, FL 33136."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Ita Aber's suggestion (Letters, Sept. 3) that Levi Strauss, whose jeans I revere, coined the word ''denim'' is a charming but mistaken notion. While the word is probably an English abbreviation of ''serge de Nîmes,'' the Oxford English Dictionary lists uses of ''denim'' in English as early as 1695. The tough, inexpensive textile Strauss used to make his early jeans in the 1850's was probably manufactured in Britain or New England. Simon Renouf Edmonton, Alberta To the Editor: Ita Aber's Sept. 3 letter on the word''denim'' did not mention the origin of the term''jeans.''

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"IN a strip mall, between a Chinese restaurant and a takeout pizza place, there is a storefront school for children with special needs that is at the center of a dispute about schools here. The dispute has little to do with children or with disabilities, though, and everything to do with race and religion in Lakewood. The former resort town near the Jersey Shore is home to one of the nation's largest communities of strict Orthodox Jews, and its recent galloping growth has left Lakewood's schools in an odd situation. In a town where Orthodox Jews represent about half the population, nearly three-quarters of the town's children attend private Jewish day schools. But the public school district, by law, must finance special education for everyone. And state education officials have found that among preschool children in special education programs in Lakewood, there is a startling divide."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"The fall men's shows in Milan were a lesson in war wear, from the modernist suits of armor at Prada to the updated army fatigues at Neil Barrett and the Austrian army coats at Dolce & Gabbana. But it was Roberto Cavalli and Alexander McQueen who, in looking east for inspiration, claimed the fiercest of warriors: the samurai. Cavalli's show, what he called his ''homage to the ancient Oriental art of seduction,'' was heavy on the glitz, with thickly embroidered kimono-style shirts (above) paired with shiny motocross pants. At McQueen, spectators were mesmerized by a troupe of Lestat look-alikes outfitted in silken japonaiserie. These clothes evoked a truly international gentleman, perhaps best personified by Richard Chamberlain in the 1980 miniseries ''Shogun.'' His character had the combination of ruggedness and refinement that always makes for a great sex symbol -- a bit rough but steeped in the mysteries of life. Think of Brian Wilson in his prime, sitting poolside at his Malibu dojo. While it's hard to fathom today's urban daddy having enough bravado to sport patterned silk leisure wear, wouldn't it be nice?

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"Meant as commercials but treasured as keepsakes, show posters occupy an uncertain aesthetic middle ground. On Sept. 1 the NATIONAL THEATER in Britain colonized that middle ground when it started selling reproductions of artwork covering most of its history, from the 1964 Laurence Olivier-Maggie Smith ''Othello'' to ''Caroline, or Change,'' which opens there next month. The 650 posters available online at www.ntposters.org.uk include some famous images (the Cubist ''Equus'' horse) and some painterly delights (a diaphanous ''Blithe Spirit''), but what's most extraordinary is how workmanlike (in the good sense) they are. With their repeated typography and standardized formats, they might be circulars for fresh produce at a grocer's. They represent a culture of theatrical plenty. While Olivier is unnamed and unrecognizable on that ''Othello'' poster, the economic climate of Broadway requires that, if possible, a named and recognizable star (or a helicopter) should dominate the visuals. But noncommercial theaters, which needn't make long-lasting brands out of their limited-run shows, can risk more evocative solutions. Among plays arriving in New York this fall, two stand out for the aptness and loveliness of their artwork. For the Roundabout's ''Heartbreak House,'' now in previews, the illustrator Scott McKowen engraved a mansion adrift (or is it sinking?) in an oily ocean: Shaw's metaphor for England expanded to suggest a broader human fate. And for ''The Coast of Utopia,'' the Tom Stoppard trilogy playing from October through March at Lincoln Center Theater, Aivazovsky's 1850 shipwreck painting ''The Ninth Wave'' provides the perfect emblem for the folly of rationalism in the face of nature. As it happens, the best seller at the National Web site depicts another Stoppard play: the 1976 ''Jumpers,'' featuring Diana Rigg. Is it too painful a contrast to note that the all-time champ at Manhattan's Triton Gallery, which has handled Broadway show posters since 1965, is ''Cats''?"

But short-term palliatives have been tried repeatedly over the last half-century to no avail, and most significant, every resort to palliatives has been treated by terror organizations as weakness, and weakness as an invitation to strike again. The hard proof is in Israel's withdrawals: Israel withdrew from Lebanon six years ago, recently withdrew from Gaza and has elected a party whose platform is to withdraw from the West Bank. The only withdrawal compatible with the charters of Hezbollah and Hamas is Israel's withdrawal into the Mediterranean. Hezbollah's oft-stated goal is the annihilation of the state of Israel, which it calls ''the Zionist entity.'' What palliative ''solution'' to annihilation works -- a compromise of only 50 percent annihilation? Ellen Schneider Fort Lauderdale, Fla."

This spring brought forth torrents of the chubby-cheeked rodents, scurrying up drainpipes, darting through stone walls, undermining shrubs, perennials and masonry with the brio of Brooklyn's mightiest tunnel sandhogs. The terrain around house and garden took on the perils of a prairie dog village, with ankle-spraining sinkholes every few feet. For the first time, I saw chipmunks scampering higher than squirrels in the pin oaks, doing greedy reconnaissance on the bird feeders below. This year's furry tide turned our middle-aged beagle, Maybelle, into a pup again. She stalked, dug, yipped and pounced herself into tiptop physical form. She has never caught a chipmunk in seven years of trying. They dart between her legs and chatter tauntingly from just beyond the perimeter of her electric dog fence. Sheer numbers increased her odds of bagging one this season. But suddenly, in early August, she gave up the chase. Heaving herself onto the sunny deck with a great sigh, she lay resigned, watching the wee marauders with the gimlet eye of a defeated old general surveying a superior ground force."

However, my first flight after 9/11 was not an easy one. None of us really wanted to be there. As the flight leader, I asked each flight attendant how they felt about flying out that night. Everyone I asked was not going to let the terrorist attack stop them from going on. I'm proud to say they did a great job with the passengers we had while en route to Venice.

But when dogs, which were being curbed by their owners, started to kill the plants, she decided last month to post more than 25 laminated signs along the street, telling residents where the pets could and could not go. The signs are rather direct. One says, ''Dogs Pee Here,'' with a picture of a dog raising a leg; another shows a squatting dog with a red slash through the picture."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Thank you for the budget tips in ''The Frugal Traveler Sees the World'' by Matt Gross. Regarding how to save money on ATM transactions, it's worth pointing out that Citibank has over 17,000 ATM locations worldwide in more than 50 countries like Spain, Chile, England and Canada. Citibank does not charge its customers transaction fees for its ATM withdrawals, but it does charge a 1 percent surcharge for the local currency. So it is worth setting up an account before taking an extensive trip; this will save you money. (And you have my word: I am a law student; I am completely unaffiliated with Citibank.)

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"I was surprised and gratified bythe appearance of Vera Farmiga on the cover of the magazine (Lynn Hirschberg, Sept. 3). As an avid moviegoer, I've seen most of the films referred to in the article. The article illustrates the true problem in Hollywood. It's not that there aren't enough meaningful roles for an actor of Farmiga's talent; it's that most of the bigwigs mentioned either hadn't seen her work or even heard of her. Instead of worrying about what hot club to attend or getting a table at the trendiest restaurant, maybe they should actually watch some movies like the rest of us. David M. Korn New York As a young director, I was fortunate enough to be encouraged by my uncle, Alan J. Pakula. Alan loved great stories and serious actors, and he also had great respect for women: his warmth and vision encouraged a great artist like Meryl Streep to do some of her most memorable work. Lynn Hirschberg compares Vera Farmiga to Streep and describes Debra Granik's ''Down to the Bone'' as ''Farmiga's best work.'' But brilliant acting is nearly always linked to fine, thoughtful directing. After the award at Sundance in 2004, why did ''Close to the Bone'' get such a tiny release, and where is Granik's next film? I would venture that if Granik were a guy daring to make such truthful, edgy work, she'd be hailed as the next Scorsese. While France has encouraged numerous female ''auteur'' directors like Claire Denis and Agnes Varda, the American film industry is regrettably not the most welcoming place for women directors with strong voices. When that changes, there may be more compelling, authentic roles for Farmiga. Jennie Livingston Brooklyn While I would not argue withthe suggestion that there are not enough serious major-studio roles for actresses, I dodispute the notion that Vera Farmiga's particular experience is representative of some kind of historical nadir of modern filmmaking. We are told that Farmiga is talented, and I'll take the writer's word for it, but the comparison between her and Meryl Streep seems a bit extreme. Furthermore, over the course of the article Hirschberg mentions wonderful contemporary actresses, from Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon and Kate Winslet to Julianne Moore, Annette Bening and Laura Linney to Cate Blanchett, Catherine Keener and Naomi Watts, who are managing to find challenging roles. Is it possible that Farmiga just isn't that great? In the meantime, I think we should all savor the fact that Streep, in her mid-50's, has just had the biggest mainstream success of her career in ''The Devil Wears Prada.'' Perhaps there is hope after all. Jon Pollack Pacific Palisades, Calif."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"YOU may have noticed that it was a banner year for chipmunks. This spring brought forth torrents of the chubby-cheeked rodents, scurrying up drainpipes, darting through stone walls, undermining shrubs, perennials and masonry with the brio of Brooklyn's mightiest tunnel sandhogs. The terrain around house and garden took on the perils of a prairie dog village, with ankle-spraining sinkholes every few feet. For the first time, I saw chipmunks scampering higher than squirrels in the pin oaks, doing greedy reconnaissance on the bird feeders below. This year's furry tide turned our middle-aged beagle, Maybelle, into a pup again. She stalked, dug, yipped and pounced herself into tiptop physical form. She has never caught a chipmunk in seven years of trying. They dart between her legs and chatter tauntingly from just beyond the perimeter of her electric dog fence. Sheer numbers increased her odds of bagging one this season. But suddenly, in early August, she gave up the chase.

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"Jolted last fall by the death of one player and stung by the controversy surrounding another, the National Basketball Association is for the first time requiring standardized cardiac screening for every player. The new rules, developed over the past year, were sent to teams this summer but were not publicized. The move is viewed as a significant step toward preventing heart-related deaths on the court. The N.B.A.'s program is the most extensive among the four major American sports leagues."

From Matt Gross and the kindness of strangers to the transformative water of the Virgin Mary's Nightingale Hill, I'm inspired to take flight -- or foot or rail or road -- to the many delightful, untrammeled corners of the globe before they're overrun or I'm too decrepit.

While not yet a majority, the Orthodox have nonetheless emerged as the dominant force in a clash of cultures. And the front line in this battle is Lawrence's once highly regarded public school system."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: A Classical Recordings review [Aug. 27] and a letter to the editor about the teenage composer Jay Greenberg [Aug. 20] both took potshots at an earlier musical prodigy, Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The reviewer Steve Smith even called Korngold ''a born genius who struggled long and hard to achieve mediocrity.'' This is the hoary old critical line on Korngold, whose early triumphs were interrupted by Hitler and Hollywood, and who found himself out of favor in the postwar years. But Mr. Greenberg or any young composer could do a lot worse than to aspire to be another Korngold, whose works, despite the continued carping of certain critics, are now widely praised, performed and recorded around the world.

Her visionary concepts for peace awarded her an invitation to be a part of the World Forum for Peace in NY and San Francisco, CA. With her sense of style and real estate savvy, she received the Award for Best Little House in America for one of the many homes she developed and was featured in House Beautiful Magazine and Log Cabin Magazine for their Log Cabin home in Montana that she designed and built with her husband. She was a seeker and passionate reader, pioneering new healing concepts.

The United States had just invaded Laos to shut down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, George Harrison had organized a benefit concert for starving Bangladesh -- and I had just graduated from St. Peter's College in Jersey City with a degree in classical languages.

The board gives two reasons: to protect residents' safety and to see who is dumping unwanted furniture, old television sets, etc. Are there any legal problems the board should consider? A. ''As long as the cameras are directed at public areas of the building, it is within the discretion of the board to install and monitor them,'' said Howard Schechter, a Manhattan co-op lawyer.

I have lived through World War II, the Holocaust, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the great civil rights movement and the protest against the Vietnam War. But the event that had the most impact, with the most lasting consequences, on my life and the lives of the next generation, our daughters and sons, was the feminist movement. To dismiss a creative work about these changes as trivial, as Alison McCulloch did in her review of my novel ''In the Name of Friendship'' (Sept. 3), is shocking. Since Ana Marie Cox did exactly the same thing to Katha Pollitt's recently published essays, it appears that the new position of the editors of the Book Review is that feminism is an illegitimate subject for literature.

Mr. Rubino, 66, gravel-voiced and grumpy beyond his years, has seen his clientele evolve from ''your sailors and bikers'' to your stereotypical suburbanites, soccer moms included. Mother-and-daughter tattoos -- the legal age is 18 in New York State, and piercing for under 18 in Suffolk County requires notarized parental permission -- on a floral or butterfly theme are a new conduit for intergenerational bonding. The oldest first-time client of Tattoo Lou's is a 98-year-old South Shore geezer who caught on to the tattoo trend and decided it wasn't too late, or too dangerous, to live dangerously in inky Technicolor."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"IN a strip mall, between a Chinese restaurant and a takeout pizza place, there is a storefront school for children with special needs that is at the center of a dispute about schools here. The dispute has little to do with children or with disabilities, though, and everything to do with race and religion in Lakewood. The former resort town near the Jersey Shore is home to one of the nation's largest communities of strict Orthodox Jews, and its recent galloping growth has left Lakewood's schools in an odd situation. In a town where Orthodox Jews represent about half the population, nearly three-quarters of the town's children attend private Jewish day schools. But the public school district, by law, must finance special education for everyone. And state education officials have found that among preschool children in special education programs in Lakewood, there is a startling divide."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"When Christopher Caldwell characterizes ''perfectly healthy people annoyed by the din of kickball,'' he minimizes a growing problem (Aug. 13). The trend toward overindulgent, permissive parenting (as well as neglectful parenting, owing to societal and workplace failures to provide adequate child-care options to working parents) is leading to a generation of young people who are dangerously apathetic to the rest of the world around them. Privileged kids roam the streets with credit cards and cellphones. It's not just playful noise but also a disregard for others. It's small wonder many adults are instinctually retreating: if there are a few kid-free bastions left these days, bring 'em on. Irene Barnard San Francisco Caldwell quotes a typical resident of a child-free community: ''When you get to be a certain age, you want to be in a community where people around you are the same age you are.'' While that is true, there may be deeper reasons. As a 12-year-old, I think children constantly remind the elderly of their mortality. Madeline Ochi Granite Bay, Calif."

After winning a César in 2005 for his role in ''Kings & Queen'' and gaining exposure in the United States as an elegant French informant in ''Munich,'' Amalric can be seen in October in ''Marie Antoinette'' (albeit briefly). This month he begins filming Julian Schnabel's ''The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,'' but he's most looking forward to directing his own film, ''because I am most of all a director.'' Naturellement.

For Peugeot, that something is the 908 RC, a design study to be displayed at the Paris auto show this month. The sleek black 908 RC is an answer to the S-Class or 7 Series, a lux limo powered by a 700-horsepower V-12 diesel designed for endurance racing."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: A problem with Robert Olen Butler's brilliant conceit in ''Severance'' (Sept. 3): After decapitation, consciousness remains in the severed head not for a minute and a half, as your reviewer explains Butler's premise, but for about 30 seconds. In 1905, a French physician timed how long the eyes responded when he called the decapitated man's name. (See my book ''Losing Our Heads: Beheadings in Literature and Culture.'') The Scottish artist Douglas Gordon made an installation piece, ''30 Seconds Text'' (1998), of a dark room, a single light bulb and a text (about consciousness's duration after decapitation) readable in the 30 seconds before the light goes out. To appreciate the full pathos of Butler's subjects, readers may want to pause at the end of the first 80 words, when the thinking has to stop. Beyond that lies only the author's hope.

They contended that it would cause undue traffic near their senior developments and induce elderly residents to gamble their savings away. ''When I look at who comes to Freehold, it is mostly people over 50, or even over 60, and it's their daytime enjoyment,'' said Mr. Codey, the brother of Senate President Richard J. Codey.

Take, for example, the advice to avoid the exchange of pieces when your advantage is primarily that of space. All well and good, but there are times when it is just a matter of choosing which exchange to make."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Richard Brookhiser's essay ''John Adams Talks to His Books'' (Sept. 3) reminds us that literature -- and by literature I do not intend to limit the discussion to canonical texts -- is interactive and engages the reader in real-time dialogue. Texts inspire us, anger us, frustrate us, delight us and elevate us, but most important, they invite us to enter the forum they inhabit and participate in the discourse they generate. The metaphysical implications of this phenomenon are intriguing, albeit abstruse (hence Derrida's ''Il n'y a pas de hors-texte''), but it is helpful to bear in mind that during its nascent stages writing was monopolized by the priestly class and the oracles. These philosophical ramblings, unfortunately, digress from Brookhiser's central thrust and are best left in the margins. Lawton King Camp Fallujah, Iraq"

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"YOU may have noticed that it was a banner year for chipmunks. This spring brought forth torrents of the chubby-cheeked rodents, scurrying up drainpipes, darting through stone walls, undermining shrubs, perennials and masonry with the brio of Brooklyn's mightiest tunnel sandhogs. The terrain around house and garden took on the perils of a prairie dog village, with ankle-spraining sinkholes every few feet. For the first time, I saw chipmunks scampering higher than squirrels in the pin oaks, doing greedy reconnaissance on the bird feeders below. This year's furry tide turned our middle-aged beagle, Maybelle, into a pup again. She stalked, dug, yipped and pounced herself into tiptop physical form. She has never caught a chipmunk in seven years of trying. They dart between her legs and chatter tauntingly from just beyond the perimeter of her electric dog fence. Sheer numbers increased her odds of bagging one this season. But suddenly, in early August, she gave up the chase. Heaving herself onto the sunny deck with a great sigh, she lay resigned, watching the wee marauders with the gimlet eye of a defeated old general surveying a superior ground force."

2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"Your ''Recipe Redux'' on meringue indeed took me back (Aug. 20). I grew up under the kitchen tutelage of my mother, who made adequate basic meals on a tight budget and fabulous desserts.We were a minister's family in small-town North Carolina, and there were always guests at our table and endless receptions,meetings, church suppers and open houses. Meringues were her specialty. She made them large and small and topped them with incredible concoctions. My favorite was homemade peppermint ice cream with chocolate sauce, sprinkled with crushed peppermint candy. Although the recipe is simple, the timing can be tricky, and also the weather. I loved the chewy little meringues that, because they hadlost their crisp perfection in hot, humid summer, my mother wouldn't serve to company. Rena Ruark Lindstrom Provincetown, Mass."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"At 26, the actor Peter Scanavino is more than the sum of his parts. Which is good, because he can claim only two major roles (on the New York stage, that is).But they're both stunners. Last spring, he made his Broadway debut as an Irish rent boy in Conor McPherson's Tony-nominated ''Shining City.'' Starting this month, he appears as an alcoholic Air Force veteran in the off-Broadway revival of Eric Bogosian's ''SubUrbia.'' Scanavino's clothes aren't the only thing that's casual on these pages: he also takes the no-frills approach to grooming. ''I've been cutting my own hair for the past four years,'' he says. ''My hair's kind of crappy. And if I comb it, it's much worse.'' Both onstage and off, Scanavino uses small gestures to say a lot. ''Sometimes when I get too styled up, I feel a bit phony.'' During the day, he prefers something more sincere: a vintage Japanese T-shirt of the only band that matters, the Clash. Paul L. Underwood"
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''Who's Killing Long Island Sound?,'' by Tom Andersen (Op-Ed, Sept. 3), could not have been better timed. As beaches along the coast closed to swimming on Labor Day weekend, many people were reminded that clean water is not a luxury. It is a necessity."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"The On the Street column on Sept. 3 referred incorrectly to the lips-and-tongue logo of the Rolling Stones. It was designed by John Pasche, not Andy Warhol. (Mr. Warhol did create the cover for the band's ''Sticky Fingers'' album, which included the logo on the inside sleeve.)"
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,George Sprott (1894-1975)
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"The Explorer column on Sept. 3 about Ephesus, Turkey, misstated the origin of the belief that the Virgin Mary once lived there. Although a German nun in the 1800's did indeed say that a house in Ephesus appeared in her visions as the residence of the Virgin Mary, the association between the town and the Virgin Mary dates to the early years of Christianity. Also, an accompanying map included an outdated name for a Turkish city near Ephesus. It is now known as Izmir, not Smyrna."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"American museums have been so occupied for the last few years with matters far from home, among them the call for greater coverage of Islamic culture, that they have often passed over domestic themes and issues. One of these is the situation of Native American artists in the contemporary art world, the subject of a fun and intriguing, but not entirely successful, exhibition at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum. Usually such exhibitions herd together disparate artists with any amount of Native American blood in their veins, the idea being that the appellation belongs to anyone who claims the ancestry. So it was reasonable to expect that the artists in ''No Reservations: Native American History and Culture in Contemporary Art'' would be descendants, no matter how remote, of American Indians, Eskimos or Aleuts."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"ROMAN ROTH, who has mastered modern technology and cellar methods, did not trample out the vintage for the 2001 merlot he has just released under his new label, the Grapes of Roth. Instead, he used his hands and heart. Mr. Roth, the winemaker at Wölffer Estate, on the South Fork, bought the grapes at Martha Clara Vineyards, on the North Fork, for his first personal release."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"For most chief executives, stepping down means a hefty cut in pay. But that is not how things went for Clifton H. Morris Jr., when at 71 he gave up the top job at the AmeriCredit Corporation after 14 years as chief executive. Last year, when AmeriCredit's board approved a salary of $950,000 for Mr. Morris's successor, Daniel E. Berce, 52, it also granted Mr. Morris a $100,000 raise, lifting his salary as chairman to $900,000, according to a document filed last week."
2006-09-17T00:00:00Z,"VERENA and Rolf Baumgartner have been married for 34 years and have run Brasserie Swiss for nearly 29. One imagines that entering the Ossining restaurant is like visiting their home, with its upright piano against one wall, pictures of Switzerland everywhere and soft yodeling playing in the background. It is a comfortable, friendly place and -- this is the key to its appeal -- emphatically untrendy. There is no chocolate lava cake or the latest take on pan-seared sea bass. Instead, you'll find authentic, delicious interpretations of traditional Swiss favorites. The menu and décor may not have changed in decades, but both are presented with care and love."

2006-09-18T00:00:00Z,"The Israeli government established a committee on Sunday to investigate the political and military leadership's handling of the recent war in Lebanon, which has come under intense public criticism in the month since the fighting ended. In Israel, which expects swift and decisive military victories, many citizens say that the military campaign in Lebanon was poorly planned and executed, and that leaders should be held accountable. Israel could not halt the rocket fire into northern Israel by the Lebanese group Hezbollah, and it has not achieved the return of two soldiers Hezbollah captured in the cross-border raid on July 12 that ignited the monthlong conflict."

2006-09-18T00:00:00Z,"BEHIND ABC'S 9/11 SERIES -- It is little wonder that ABC's mini-series ''The Path to 9/11'' drew stinging criticism for its invented scenes, made-up dialogue and unsubstantiated accounts. A more puzzling question is why ABC spent $30 million on what amounted to a five-hour public service announcement. [Page C1.] FROM HUNTER TO HUNTED -- Duane Chapman, the star of A&E's ''Dog the Bounty Hunter,'' found himself on the other side of the handcuffs last week because of a three-year-old charge stemming from one of his captures.

A1 Chinese in World Bank Territory Eager for stable friends in Southeast Asia, China is making large-scale loans to countries that used to be the sole preserve of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the United States and Japan.

2006-09-18T00:00:00Z,"Looking Ahead After a smorgasbord of action Saturday that pitted ranked teams against each other in seven games, the pairing of top-25 teams is lighter this week. Only two games match ranked teams: No. 1 Ohio State (3-0) will play host to No. 24 Penn State (2-1), and No. 20 Arizona State (3-0) will visit No. 22 California (2-1). There are, however, other intriguing matchups, like No. 12 Notre Dame (2-1) visiting Michigan State (3-0) and No. 8 Louisville (3-0) traveling to play Kansas State (3-0). Louisville will be without the junior quarterback Brian Brohm, who had surgery yesterday to repair sprained ligaments in his throwing hand. He will miss four to six weeks. Line of the Week 24 of 48, 234 yards, 3 TD's, 3 INT's Brady Quinn struggled in second-ranked Notre Dame's 47-21 home loss to No. 11 Michigan, dealing a setback to his Heisman campaign. The Wolverines produced 17 points off three of his four turnovers. Quinn, a senior quarterback, entered the game having not thrown an interception in 143 pass attempts, a team record, but threw three Saturday. Frantic Finish Murray State 59, Indiana State 40. The Division I-AA teams combined for 1,116 yards of total offense and 54 first downs, and scored 42 points in the fourth quarter. The Sycamores (0-3) have lost 20 straight games. A Strong Start Before the season, Oklahoma tailback Adrian Peterson, below, predicted that he would rush for 2,500 yards. After three games, he is averaging 171.7 yards a game, leaving him behind in his quest. To reach his goal, Peterson, a junior, will need to average 198.5 yards the rest of the season and the Sooners (2-1) will have to qualify for a bowl. If Oklahoma plays in the Big 12 championship game and a bowl, he will need to average 180.5 yards. Show of Strength Just six days after his father died of a heart attack, the Iowa junior linebacker Mike Klinkenborg made eight tackles in No. 16 Iowa's 27-17 victory over Iowa State. The team's leading tackler, he helped hold the Cyclones scoreless in the game's final 23 minutes. The Hawkeyes (3-0) had lost six of their eight meetings to Iowa State (2-1). Horned Frogs on a Run Texas Christian is 4-0 against Big 12 Conference teams since 2005 after Saturday's 12-3 victory against Texas Tech (2-1). The Horned Frogs (3-0), who upset Oklahoma last season, have won 13 games in a row, the longest winning streak in Division I-A. Numbers Adding Up The Northern Illinois senior tailback Garrett Wolfe rushed for 263 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 31-13 victory against Buffalo. Wolfe broke the 200-yard mark for the eighth time in his career, a team record. His 630 rushing yards this season (an average of 210 yards a game) are the highest total in Division I-A and make him a dark horse to win the Heisman."

Ms. Pirro said, ''His approach is to give amnesty to Medicaid cheats. This kind of approach makes it very clear that my opponent does not understand the role of the attorney general.'' Wendy Katz, a spokeswoman for the Cuomo campaign, said that amnesty was not part of his plan for reducing Medicaid fraud and added, ''The fraud is in the misleading attacks against Andrew just three days after Ms. Pirro pledged to run a positive campaign.''

Or try ''Phoenix,'' in which Cibelle wants to ''glide up like little birds'' amid music boxes, synthesized peeps and neo-Baroque cello."

''The Outsider,'' DJ Shadow's new full-length album, includes cameos by the Federation, a hyphy crew, and E-40, a leading rapper in the style.

Publication is scheduled for spring.

Discussing plans for the winner, Connie Fisher, 23, right, to sing at the Palladium in six of the eight weekly performances, he said it was his ''duty'' to protect her voice, the BBC reported, and he added that it was ''absolutely normal'' for a young leading lady to sing fewer than eight performances weekly. ''This was the case when Sarah Brightman starred in 'The Phantom of the Opera' at the age of 22,'' he said. ''It was the same for Elaine Paige in 'Evita' and is true of Elena Roger, who is starring in the new production of 'Evita.' '' Ms. Fisher told BBC News: ''I would love to do eight shows a week. But I have to test my stamina.''

The woman, Lory M. Scott, is charged with second-degree murder. Prosecutors said she married a hospital security guard, Tyrone Alston, 37, who had legally changed his name to Nubian Knight.

In court yesterday, prosecutors called his sister Danielle L. Singleton, who lived a block away from her brother and saw him twice a week, to testify that she had been unaware of the marriage.

Reeve, asked the judge to give his client credit for having cooperated with the authorities once he was arrested. Mr. Reeve argued that the &#8220;consequences of the case could be highly beneficial&#8221; to the institutions if &#8220;the hard lessons&#8221; it taught led them to enhance security and update their inventories."

Marshall, said in a court filing yesterday in which he further defends himself in the legal battle over his mother’s care and finances. The court papers said that her doctors concluded that her condition would worsen significantly if left untreated. Mr. Marshall, 82, said he decided against opening Mrs. Astor’s Holly Hill estate in Westchester over the summer because he wanted her to be close to her medical team in Manhattan. Since a short stay at Lenox Hill Hospital in late July Mrs. Astor, who is 104, has been living at Holly Hill. In an affidavit that was part of Mr. Marshall’s filing, one of the socialite’s chefs said her weekday nurse was so aggressive about feeding Mrs. Astor that she once broke some of her teeth and another time burned her tongue, causing her to scream. “I do not believe that anyone told Mr. Marshall about either of these things,” the chef said in the affidavit."

The film, ''My Life in Ruins,'' scheduled to go before the cameras late next month, tells of a group of tourists introduced to ancient Greece by a Greek-American guide, played by Ms. Vardalos.

The report said the petroglyphs are menaced by acid rain from petrochemical plants in the area and by development projects that involve blasting. The million carvings, said to be the largest such collection in the world, are 6,000 to 30,000 years old and chronicle ancient Aboriginal societies.

Re, Chief Judge Emeritus of the United States Court of International Trade. Judge Re was recognized for his integrity, fairness and clarity of decisions by practitioners before the Court. The history of the United States Court of International Trade will forever be tied to his vision and tireless efforts, which led to the enactment of the Customs Courts Act of 1980 and brought expanded jurisdiction, increased remedies and greater access to judicial review to litigants seeking the peaceful resolution of customs and international trade disputes.

In June and July, I like lettuce plain, with olive oil and vinegar splashed on straight from the bottle, plus salt and pepper. It is one of the skills I am secretly exceptionally proud of, this ability to dress a salad in the bowl without mixing up the dressing on the side first. I am convinced that salad tastes better this way, though I can't figure out why. And I enjoy doing it -- I feel more in tune with the greens, and also more picturesque (which, by the way, is a vast and unexplored category of human satisfaction). If you don't already know how to do it, here is the secret: use more oil than you think you should, less vinegar than you think you should, and be generous with the salt."

Contrary to the often repeated assertion that Mr. Bush demonstrates strong leadership qualities, psychologists would suggest that the president's decision-making style actually reflects an extreme rigidity that confirms a serious character flaw: No commander in his right mind would insist upon marching his soldiers over a bridge that was in the process of collapsing."

2006-09-20T00:00:00Z,"More than 450 artists sent a letter yesterday to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum in Poland demanding the release of seven paintings created by a California woman during her imprisonment there in 1944. ''The fundamental principle that art belongs to the artist who create it is recognized everywhere except totalitarian countries,'' said the letter, signed by Stan Lee, the creator of Spider-Man; Lynn Johnston, the cartoonist of the ''For Better or For Worse'' comic strip; and the Pulitzer Prize winners Art Spiegelman and Michael Chabon, among others. ''One would hope that Poland, having been liberated from totalitarian rule, would not revert to the mentality that regards everything as the property of the state.'' Museum officials have refused for more than 30 years to return the artwork to Dina Gottliebova Babbitt, 83, of Felton, Calif., above, a retired Hollywood animator. Mrs. Babbitt was unaware that her paintings had survived until the museum contacted her to authenticate them in 1973. Museum officials said last month that the paintings' historical significance as Holocaust documentation was more important than Mrs. Babbitt's claims of property rights. STEVE FRIESS"

2006-09-20T00:00:00Z,"READERS' GUIDE: Starting today, The Times is introducing several design changes in its daily news pages to underscore the distinctions between straightforward news coverage and other journalistic forms that provide additional perspective on events. These special forms -- news analysis articles, columns and others -- adhere to standards different from those of the editorial and Op-Ed pages. The news and editorial departments do not coordinate coverage and maintain a strict separation in staff and management. All articles, columns, editorials and contributions in the newspaper are subject to the same requirements of factual accuracy. A readers' guide to the various forms in the news sections and the opinion pages is published on this page today. It will remain online at nytimes.com/readersguide."
2006-09-20T00:00:00Z,"In the News Sections MAN OR WOMAN IN THE NEWS: A portrait of a central figure in a news situation. It is not primarily analytical, but highlights aspects of the subject's background and career that shed light on that figure's role in the current event. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: A writer's collection of several anecdotes or brief reports, often supplementing coverage of major news events like a summit meeting or an important trial. The items provide glimpses behind the scenes that flesh out the reader's sense of a major story. MEMO: A reflective article, often with an informal or conversational tone, offering a look behind the scenes at issues or political developments. The article (with a title like Political Memo, White House Memo or Memo From London) may draw connections among several events, or tell the reader who and what shaped them. JOURNAL: A sharply drawn feature article focusing on a place or event (and labeled with the place name, whether foreign, national or regional). A Journal is closely observed and stylishly written, often light or humorous in tone. It is intended to give the reader a vivid sense of a place and time. NEWS ANALYSIS: A close examination of the ramifications of an important news situation. It includes thorough reporting, but also draws heavily on the expertise of the writer. The article helps the reader understand underlying causes or possible consequences of a news event, but does not reflect the writer's personal opinion. APPRAISAL: A broad evaluation, generally by a critic or a specialized writer, of the career and work of a major figure who has died. The article often accompanies an obituary. REVIEW: A specialized critic's appraisal of works of creativity -- movies, books, restaurants, fashion collections. Unlike other feature writers, critics are expected to render opinions in their areas of expertise. NEWS-PAGE COLUMN: A writer's regularly scheduled essay, offering original insight and perspective on the news. The column often has a distinctive point of view and makes a case for it with reporting. (Columns in the news pages are displayed with the writer's name and the column's title inset into the text.) The news sections also present a number of regular feature articles that carry labels indicating the topics - for example, the Saturday Profile in the foreign pages and Market Place in Business Day. In the Opinion Pages EDITORIAL: A sharply written, generally brief article about any issue of public interest. Editorials are written by the editorial board of The Times, which includes the editorial page editor, the deputy and assistant editors, and a group of writers with expertise in a variety of fields. While the writers' opinions are of great importance, the editorials also reflect the longtime core beliefs of the page. Unlike the editors of the news sections, the editorial page editor not only reports to the publisher, but consults with him on the page's positions. Editorials are based on reporting, often original and in-depth, but they are not intended to give a balanced look at both sides of a debate. Rather, they offer clear opinion and distinct positions. EDITORIAL OBSERVER: A signed article by a member of the editorial board. These articles have a more distinct personal voice than an editorial. They often reflect personal experiences or observations, and may be written in the first person. These articles are not intended to be policy pronouncements, but do not contradict the board's positions. OP-ED COLUMN: An essay by a columnist on the staff of The Times, reflecting the opinions of the writer on any topic. Columnists are expected to do original reporting. Some travel extensively. Op-Ed columns are edited only for style and usage, not for content. Columnists do not submit their topics for approval, and are free to agree or disagree with editorial positions. OP-ED CONTRIBUTION: An article by a person not on the staff of The Times, reflecting opinions about a topic on which the author is an expert or has provocative and well-reasoned ideas. These articles, most of which are solicited by the editors, are not intended to reflect the positions of the editorial board. Indeed, the Op-Ed page is seen as a forum to air diverse and challenging viewpoints."

2006-09-20T00:00:00Z,"CHRYSLER PLANS RESTRUCTURING -- Chrysler said it would cut its production schedule for the rest of the year by 16 percent, because of slumping sales as a result of high gas prices, on the heels of similar cuts at General Motors and Ford. The head of Chrysler, Thomas W. LaSorda, above, signaled that it would embark on its second restructuring in six years. [Page C1.] AFTER THE STORM -- A day after disclosing that a disastrous bet on natural gas prices had produced losses of more than $3 billion, Amaranth Advisors, once among the nation's largest and hottest hedge funds, worked with commodity exchange officials to reassign its trades. [C1.] OTHERS PROFIT FROM GAS DECLINE -- Even as Amaranth Advisors lost billions of dollars betting, in essence, that natural gas prices would rise, more fortunate traders raked in big profits in recent weeks counting on gas prices to fall. [C4.] RIPPLE REACHES SAN DIEGO -- Much of San Diego County's pension fund strategy was tied to a basket of hedge funds that included Amaranth Advisors.

Maounis, founder of Amaranth Advisors, marketed his hedge fund to potential investors, he would stress his firm's significant investment in its risk management and teamwork techniques.

[C3.] MORE SIGNS OF SOFT LANDING -- A day before the Federal Reserve's decision on where to set interest rates, the Labor Department reported fresh evidence that inflation is doing exactly what the central bank has said it would do: slow down with the economy. [C3.] YAHOO PLUNGES ON SOFT AD SALES -- Shares of Yahoo fell more than 11 percent after the company disclosed that it had sold less advertising in recent weeks than expected, largely because of a slowdown in automobile and financial advertising. Yahoo said that it would still meet its financial targets for the third quarter, but that its profit and revenue would be toward the bottom end of its forecast range. Market Place.

2006-09-20T00:00:00Z,"IF I were to ask someone who knows about the world's cuisines, ''Where is the combination of chili, cumin, garlic and lamb a classic?'' the most likely answers would be North Africa, the Middle East or elsewhere in western Asia. But this dish is straight from Mongolia, via the street vendors of Queens, and it's little more than those four ingredients. On the street, the lamb is marinated for who knows how long, threaded onto skewers, grilled quickly over very hot charcoal and sold for a buck -- maybe two -- a stick. If you wanted to do it that way at home, you could, with good wood charcoal and a grill rack pretty close to the heat. You want to sear the lamb, but keep it medium rare."

Goldman, which has thousands of workers scattered around Lower Manhattan, built an office tower, which houses about 2,000 employees, on the west side of the Hudson River in 2004. “We do it very reluctantly,” Tom Fox, president of New York Water Taxi, said of the fare increase, which takes effect next week.

It is true that the Jets play at Buffalo this weekend, and it is true that Teague played center for the Bills for the past four seasons. Given the circumstances, however, he does not have time for such things. There are many other issues occupying Teague's mind. There is the question of whether he can play on Sunday, given his recovery from a broken left ankle sustained in an off-season workout in June. Then there is the question of what position he might play if he does suit up. He may be asked to spell the injured left guard Pete Kendall, even though the nine-year veteran Teague has never played guard."

Invisible Woman's decision stemmed from her husband's use of a superpowered clone who killed Goliath, an antiregistration hero, in battle.

2006-09-21T00:00:00Z,"UNITED STATES Tiger Woods Age -- 30 World rank -- 1 Past Ryder Cups -- 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004 Record -- 7 wins, 11 losses, 2 halves Perhaps it would have been different if Tiger Woods had also hung a poster of Billy Casper next to the one of Jack Nicklaus on the wall of his childhood room. It is Casper who holds the American record for most points won during a Ryder Cup career, with 23 1/2. But Woods has long been much more focused on Nicklaus's career mark of 18 major victories. Phil Mickelson Age -- 36 World rank -- 2 Past Ryder Cups -- 1995, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004 Record -- 9-8-3 As Woods has rattled off birdies and victories, it has been easy to forget that three months ago, Mickelson was one hole away from becoming the world's dominant golfer. All he had to do was par the 18th at Winged Foot in June to win the United States Open and his third straight major. But he had a meltdown instead, ending with a double bogey. Mickelson has not come close to winning since, and he has not played a tournament in September. Jim Furyk Age -- 36 World rank -- 3 Past Ryder Cups -- 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004 Record -- 4-9-2 Chris DiMarco Age -- 37 World rank -- 15 Past Ryder Cups -- 2004 Record -- 2-1-1 David Toms Age -- 39 World rank -- 16 Past Ryder Cups -- 2002, 2004 Record -- 4-3-1 Chad Campbell Age -- 32 World rank -- 22 Past Ryder Cups -- 2004 Record -- 1-2-0 Stewart Cink Age -- 33 World rank -- 23 Past Ryder Cups -- 2002, 2004 Record -- 2-4-1 Scott Verplank Age -- 42 World rank -- 37 Past Ryder Cups -- 2002 Record -- 2-1-0 Zach Johnson Age -- 30 World rank -- 42 Past Ryder Cups -- Rookie Vaughn Taylor Age -- 30 World rank -- 60 Past Ryder Cups -- Rookie J. J. Henry Age -- 31 World rank -- 64 Past Ryder Cups -- Rookie Brett Wetterich Age -- 33 World rank -- 68 Past Ryder Cups -- Rookie Tom Lehman (Nonplaying captain) age -- 47 Past Ryder Cups -- 1995, 1997, 1999 Record -- 5-3-2 Europe Sergio García Age -- 26 Country -- Spain World ranking -- 8 Past Ryder Cups -- 1999, 2002, 2004 Record -- 10-3-2 Putting troubles and an uneven temper have kept him from winning a major. He delivered 4 1/2 points out of a possible 5 last time around at Oakland Hills. Luke Donald Age -- 28 Country -- England World ranking -- 9 Past Ryder Cups -- 2004 Record -- 2-1-1 Anointed Europe's next big thing, Donald looks more like a steady, mature performer: an English expatriate who does everything well but lacks the strapping frame and power game to hang with Woods and Mickelson on a week-in, major-out basis. Rejected at Stanford, Woods's alma mater, Donald ended up studying at Northwestern, where he won the national collegiate title and majored in art. Henrik Stenson Age -- 30 Country -- Sweden World ranking -- 11 Past Ryder Cups -- Rookie The K Club would probably not have been Stenson's first choice for his Ryder Cup debut. While playing there during the 2001 European Open, he was so overwrought that he quit midway through a round. Sports psychology ultimately proved helpful. Stenson, a Swede, is one of the most intimidating long-iron players in the game, which leads to plenty of birdies, and that should lead to plenty of four-ball play at the K Club, despite the memories. David Howell Age -- 31 Country -- England World ranking -- 13 Past Ryder Cups -- 2004 Record -- 1-1-0 Modest is a word often applied to Howell: from his modest beginnings in the down-market English town of Swindon to his modest reaction to the brilliant 6-iron at the 17th hole that kept the 2004 Ryder Cup at Oakland Hills from swinging the Americans' way. It was a shot Howell quickly conceded was a mis-hit. Howell has had some terrific results in the past year, staring down Tiger Woods (politely) in the final group to win the HSBC Champions Tournament in Shanghai, then winning the BMW Championship by five shots in May. Colin Montgomerie Age -- 43 Country -- Scotland World ranking -- 14 Past Ryder Cups -- 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004 Record -- 19-8-5 This event puts Monty in a parallel universe, one where he is no longer distracted by the gallery chatter, clicking cameras and final-day pressure that have conspired to deprive him of a major championship. Paul Casey Age -- 29 Country -- England World ranking -- 17 Past Ryder Cups -- 2004 Record -- 1-1-0 Not long after playing a small role in Europe's 2004 victory, Casey gave a harsh critique of American culture in an interview with The Sunday Times. ''Americans,'' he said, ''can be bloody annoying.'' As for the American Ryder Cup team, he said, ''We properly hate them.'' Seldom has a bulletin board had so much advance material. Casey has since apologized to various American golfers, including Tom Lehman. Padraig Harrington Age -- 35 Country -- Ireland World ranking -- 18 Past Ryder Cups -- 1999, 2002, 2004 Record -- 7-4-1 Harrington once studied accounting in Dublin, figuring golf was no sure thing, but he has ended up with plenty of prize money and Ryder Cup points. He won four of five matches in 2004. With a chance at this year's United States Open, his game disintegrated, and he has missed cuts at the British Open and the P.G.A. Championship. But he likes the K Club, having finished second in two European Opens, and the crowd will help him. José María Olazábal Age -- 40 Country -- Spain World ranking -- 19 Past Ryder Cups -- 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1997, 1999 Record -- 15-8-5 Darren Clarke Age -- 38 Country -- Northern Ireland World ranking -- 24 Past Ryder Cups -- 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004 Record -- 7-7-3 Robert Karlsson Age -- 37 Country -- Sweden World ranking -- 36 Past Ryder Cups -- Rookie Lee Westwood Age -- 33 Country -- England World ranking -- 51 Past Ryder Cups -- 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004 Record -- 11-8-1 Paul McGinley Age -- 39 Country -- Ireland World ranking -- 53 Past Ryder Cups -- 2002, 2004 Record -- 2-1-3 Ian Woosnam (Nonplaying captain) age -- 48 Country -- Wales Past Ryder Cups -- 1983, 1985, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997 Record -- 14-12-5"

2006-09-21T00:00:00Z,"Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, opened his presidential campaign on the battlefield of Valmy in the northeast, where in 1792 a French revolutionary army fended off an invading force of Prussians seeking to restore Louis XVI to the throne. The battle was an important victory of the French Revolution, and the symbolism was typical of the 78-year-old Mr. Le Pen, who shocked France in the 2002 elections by finishing second to Jacques Chirac. He told a gathering of several hundred followers that he called on everyone in France, including ''the French of foreign origin,'' to rally around his crusade against illegal immigration. He wants France to expel all illegal immigrants, estimated at as many as 400,000. His backing has increased in recent months, a result of the riots that swept through France's poor and mainly immigrant suburbs last year. JOHN TAGLIABUE (NYT)"

2006-09-21T00:00:00Z,"The New-York Historical Society announced that it would mount a $3.5 million exhibition, ''New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War,'' to open on Nov. 17. The show will present about 300 artifacts, documents, drawings, maps and other images in a sequel to last year's exhibition ''Slavery in New York,'' which drew 175,000 visitors. The time frame of the first show ended in 1827, when black New Yorkers celebrated emancipation in New York State. Dr. Louise Mirrer, the society's president, said the new show would focus on the persistent effects of racism in the state and New York City through the Civil War and Reconstruction, including the draft riots of 1863, as well as the economic and political connections between New York and the system of slavery. The exhibition will document the ways in which ''New York was the economic capital of the capital that was financing the South,'' said James Oliver Horton, the Benjamin Banneker Professor of American Studies and History at George Washington University, the exhibition's chief historian.

The song he wrote for the occasion, ''John Sinclair,'' was remarkably effective. Within days, the Michigan Supreme Court ordered Mr. Sinclair released. What Lennon did not know at the time was that there were F.B.I. informants in the audience taking notes on everything from the attendance (15,000) to the artistic merits of his new song. (''Lacking Lennon's usual standards,'' his F.B.I. file reports, and ''Yoko can't even remain on key.'') The government spied on Lennon for the next 12 months, and tried to have him deported to England."

2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Parched and rugged terrain provided inspiration for the last album by the Gebhard Ullmann-Steve Swell Quartet, ''Desert Songs and Other Landscapes'' (CIMP). Not long before the album was recorded, the trombonist Steve Swell spent a few nights camping out in the Sahara. The German saxophonist and clarinetist Gebhard Ullmann, above, had traveled through the American Southwest. When the two musicians came together for a tour and subsequent recording in July 2004 -- with the flexible rhythm team of Hilliard Greene on bass and Barry Altschul on drums -- they easily found common ground in abrasive textures and arid atmosphere. Of course, given their chosen style of aggressive free improvisation, things might have turned out much the same even without a theme. Mr. Ullmann, a prominent figure on the Berlin avant-garde scene, has a tirelessly interrogatory approach to improvisation, as he has proven on recent albums. (His latest is a bare-bones trio recording, ''Cutitout,'' on Leo Records.) Mr. Swell is more of a blusterer, after the exuberant tradition of Roswell Rudd; but he also puts clear thought into his compositions and ensemble organization. (His band Slammin' the Infinite has a new release, ''Remember Now,'' on the Not Two label.) The band now known as the Ullmann/Swell 4 will be touring Europe for the first time this fall, but first it has a few dates in New York. No two performances will be alike, though it's safe to assume that certain qualities, including a sort of scorched-earth intensity, should carry over from one to the next.

2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Whitney Museum of American Art 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street Through Jan. 7 Some younger painters seem to be countering the strictures of late Modernism by revisiting the early Modernist cusp between abstraction and representation, an area that includes Mondrian's flower paintings, Jawlensky's masks and Malevich's robotlike peasants, where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled. There they seek paths not taken, tangents not explored. That their searches have not been in vain is evidenced by work as varied as that of Tomma Abts, Wade Guyton, Eileen Quinlan, Sergei Jensen, Cheyney Thompson and a host of others, including the Los Angeles painter Mark Grotjahn."

2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Diner's Guide presents excerpts from recent restaurant reviews. Freemans A forlorn alley, a few walls of taxidermy and hot artichoke dip: these are the blocks with which Freemans built its formidable success, underscored by an expansion in early 2006 that increased the number of seats to 105 from about 60. It's an ultracool enclave: the confluence of the Lower East Side, Appalachia, a British hunting lodge and a suburban 1950's dinner party. Drop by and drink up, but order carefully. The filet mignon with horseradish cream was fine; the grilled trout and the poached chicken, not so much. And gird yourself for service that can be brittle and dismissive. End of Freeman Alley, off Rivington Street, between the Bowery and Chrystie Street, Lower East Side; (212) 420-0012. Dinner entrees, $12 to $26. Satisfactory. Trestle on Tenth Extending the recently formed restaurant row on 10th Avenue another few dozen feet to the north, Trestle on Tenth serves rebelliously hearty and sometimes seductively homey fare that reflects the Swiss upbringing of its chef and owner, Ralf Kuettel. On a concise menu with standouts like saddle of lamb, veal kidneys and pork loin, there were a few too many disappointments, but Mr. Kuettel, who knows wine, has put together a list of affordable, adventurous selections from small producers, most of them European. It's a model of what a restaurateur without tons of money or storage space can do. 242 10th Avenue, at 24th Street, Chelsea; (212) 645-5659, trestleontenth.com. Dinner entrees, $18 to $25. * [Rating: One Star] Japonais An offshoot of a restaurant already established in Chicago and bound for Las Vegas, Japonais inhabits a genre of glossy, gargantuan Asian-fusion extravaganzas that has gone from plump to morbidly obese in no time flat. That doesn't mean it and its Japanese-French cooking aren't enjoyable at times. A riff on Peking duck was wonderful, as were some of the sushi rolls. But the kitchen's performance was erratic, the service was often off-key, and the whole production is familiar to anyone who's spent time in Morimoto, Ono, Nobu 57 and so many other peers. Anyone who hasn't may well find Japonais enchanting. 111 East 18th Street, Manhattan; (212) 260-2020. Sashimi, sushi and sushi rolls, $3 to $38; entrees, $26 to $58. * [Rating: One Star] Felidia Lidia Bastianich's celebrity (television shows, books) goes far beyond this terrific restaurant, which helped set her on her path. But the enduringly splendid Istrian and northern Italian food at Felidia shows that she isn't neglecting her roots. Felidia excels at game, organ meat, risotto and pasta dishes that showcase slow-cooked sauces using fatty meats. This is big stuff, and the best of it commands attention without groveling for it, hitting a midpoint between regal and rustic that's all its own. The wine list, emphasizing northern Italy, is great. 243 East 58th Street, Manhattan; (212) 758-1479, felidia.lidiasitaly.com. Dinner entrees, $25 to $36; pasta, $20 to $30. *** [Rating: Three Stars] What the stars mean: (None) Poor to satisfactory; * Good; ** Very good; *** Excellent; **** Extraordinary."

2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"To affix an exact date to the beginning of any ''movement'' is to risk offending those who came before and may have paved the way (or fancied doing so). Fastening a date to the genesis of the Off Off Broadway scene is no exception. But we can come pretty close. Stephen Bottoms, the author of ''Playing Underground'' (2004, University of Michigan Press), is among those who consider Nov. 24, 1960, a landmark date: the first time The Village Voice included events listings titled ''Off Off Broadway.'' Forty-six years later, the Off Off Broadway company Peculiar Works Project is marking the work of those early downtown theatrical pioneers with ''Off Stage: The West Village Fragments,'' a walking tour, performance and history lesson that will meander through Greenwich Village during the next few weekends, stopping at key locations. Some 50 actors and a dozen or so directors will offer scenes from some of downtown theater's most influential plays, mainly from the 1960's. ''The idea is to celebrate the early days and explore the confluence of events that came together to make this movement happen,'' said Catherine Porter, one of the group's three artistic directors. (Ralph Lewis and Barry Rowell round out the team.)"

2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Postmasters 459 West 19th Street Through Oct. 7 Natalie Jeremijenko's show at Postmasters is a collective enterprise, her collaborators being several environmentally savvy architect-designers and untold numbers of New York City birds. Major migration flight paths run directly through the city, contributing to a serious population density, which is not so different from that experienced by humans. Ms. Jeremijenko, who merges the roles of artist, sociologist and environmentalist, sees the comparison as inarguable and addresses it directly, from an avian perspective."
2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Because of a color reproduction error, portions of two maps accompanying a front-page article on Sept. 13 about diabetes in India failed to print in some copies. The complete maps are at www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/world/asia/13diabetes.html."
2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"The Away column on Sept. 8 about Mark Veeder, a weekend-home owner in Sullivan County, N.Y., misstated the partner with whom he purchased an old boarding house in Barryville. It was Lynne O'Neill, not Michael Schroeder. The column also misspelled part of the name of a foundation that helped with beautification in Barryville. It is the Alan Gerry Foundation, not Gehry."
2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"A picture in Weekend last Friday with the Inside Art column was published in error. It showed the 1504 Dürer drawing ''Adam and Eve,'' which has long been in the collection of the Morgan Library and Museum, not the ''Adam and Eve'' Dürer print that the museum recently acquired. The correct image appears today on Page 31 of Weekend. The column misidentified the city in California where the dealer who handled the sale of the print, Robert M. Light, is based. It is Santa Barbara, not San Francisco."
2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"NATO's secretary general, walking a fine line between projecting strength and claiming weakness, called yesterday for more efforts to beef up NATO forces in Afghanistan, while at the same time announcing that he was happy that a target of 2,000 more soldiers had been met. ''I am relatively satisfied, but I add more can be done and more should be done,'' Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told reporters after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers on the outskirts of the ongoing United Nations General Assembly meeting. ''This is not to say that on the basis of what we have, we cannot do what we have to do. But it is always better with more forces,'' he said."
2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"The United States has agreed, once again, to extend the ''weeks, not months'' deadline that it set in June for Iran to stop uranium enrichment or face Security Council sanctions. The new deadline: early October. A senior Bush administration official said Thursday that foreign ministers from the six world powers seeking to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions decided Tuesday night to give Iran a little more time to comply with their demand. Iran missed an Aug. 31 deadline for suspending enrichment, and the United States is pushing for a new measure imposing travel bans and asset freezes on Iranian officials."
2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"An article on Monday about Gavin Dutchin, a mentally ill man charged with attacking a New York police detective with a lead pipe, misstated the former name of the agency that ran a psychiatric treatment program in which Mr. Dutchin had been enrolled. The agency is FEGS, formerly known as the Federation -- not Federal -- Employment and Guidance Service."

2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian president, refused to say Thursday whether he would comply with a Security Council demand for the disarmament and disbanding of Hezbollah, the Tehran-backed guerrilla group that fought a 34-day war with Israel. ''I'd like to say that Lebanon's affairs are its own affairs, and we don't want to interfere,'' he said, when asked about the resolution that ended the combat in Lebanon last month."
2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Afghanistan nominated Ashraf Ghani, a former finance minister and World Bank executive who is now the chancellor of Kabul University, to join six other announced candidates to succeed Secretary General Kofi Annan. Two straw polls of the Security Council have shown Ban Ki-moon, the foreign minister of South Korea, in the lead and Shashi Tharoor of India, the United Nations under secretary general for communications, second. The candidacy of the man in third place, Surakiart Sathirathai, the deputy prime minister of Thailand, has been cast into doubt by the coup on Tuesday that deposed Thaksin Shinawatra, the prime minister.

Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. Broadway 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ASYLUM: THE STRANGE CASE OF MARY LINCOLN' This musical telling of the real-life tale of the former first lady and how her son had her committed to an asylum in 1875 has some structural problems and could use more exposition by June Bingham, the book writer, but some of Carmel Owen's songs are decent, and the saga has a pull to it (1:45). The Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman) 'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'LEMKIN'S HOUSE' The man who invented the word genocide, Raphael Lemkin, turns out to have an unsettled afterlife in this compelling drama by Catherine Filloux. He learns, through visitations by Tutsis and others, that the international law he campaigned for against genocide may not have accomplished anything. John Daggett is impressive as Lemkin (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'THE MAN HIMSELF' Ami Dayan stars in his own adaptation of Alan Drury's play about an average man's slide into religious fanaticism. An unsettling tale of everyday alienation and its potentially dangerous consequences (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) * 'SEVEN GUITARS' (2:45). Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) 'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00). Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting a series of fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'I 3/5sheart 4/5 KANT' Ken Urban's nimble, knowing one-act is about four women (a graduate student, a heroin addict, a depressive and a bombing victim), the men in their lives and the little humiliations and unexpected certainties of daily existence (1:10). Linhart Theater at 440 Studios, 440 Lafayette Street, near Astor Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates) 'intellectuals' Scott C. Sickles's comedy about a woman who decides to try lesbianism and how it affects her husband has lots of great lines, though the director, David Gautschy, and some of the actors aren't up to the pacing challenge. Ellen Dolan of ''As the World Turns'' is appealing in the lead, though (2:05). The Workshop Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 695-4173. (Genzlinger) 'nami' Chad Beckim's well-acted but overheated drama is about two dysfunctional couples whose fates intersect tragically (2:00). Kirk Theater, Theater Row Studios, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) Spectacles 'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims for a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles. It's the main event at the Spiegeltent, a vintage European tradition visiting South Street Seaport this summer (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette) 'REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP-SHOPPING' Reverend Billy (a k a the performance artist Bill Talen) struts and preaches his way across the Spiegeltent stage accompanied by a choir and a fine seven-piece band. Radical political theater has rarely been more thoughtful or fun (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (George Hunka) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). 2005 New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'FOGGY BOTTOM' James Armstrong's comedy about a Washingtonian who seduces women by promising them green cards has a nice sense of the ridiculous, but sometimes the action is unbelievable, even by the standards of farce (2:00). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Gates) 'FRINGE NYC ENCORES' Ten hits from the New York International Fringe Festival return for a second run at two theaters. Shows include ''Billy the Mime,'' ''Walmartopia,'' ''Broken Hands,'' ''Danny Boy,'' ''Open House'' and others. The 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village; Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AMERICAN HARDCORE' (R, 98 minutes) The documentary history of the American hardcore punk rock movement that flourished as an underground in the first half of the 1980's is as swift and jagged as the defiant music it remembers with an encyclopedic thoroughness. (Stephen Holden) 'AURORA BOREALIS' (R, 110 minutes) Miserable in Minneapolis, a damaged slacker finds his life heating up when he connects with the nurse looking after his grandfather. Juliette Lewis stirs up this affable rubbish with a performance that hints that she can play more than sexpots and psychopaths. (Nathan Lee) 'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis) 'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, this film is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Holden) 'CONFETTI' (R, 94 minutes) In this mildly amusing mock documentary, three engaged couples compete in a British bridal magazine's contest for most original wedding concept. ''Best in Show,'' the movie's obvious inspiration, it's not. (Holden) 'THE COVENANT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) The director Renny Harlin proves that ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' was not the nadir of his career with this thriller about boy witches fending off a nefarious transfer student. (Lee) 'CRANK' (R, 83 minutes) A poisoned hit man rampages in Los Angeles, doling revenge on his nemesis and misanthropy on all. Basically a broken-down retread of ''Speed,'' with Jason Stratham as the bus. (Lee) 'CROSSOVER' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Bling is bad, and friends are good in this story of temptation, rivalry and cheerleaders, set in the world of Detroit street basketball. (Lee) 'EVERYONE'S HERO' (G, 88 minutes) Animated in name only, ''Everyone's Hero'' follows a 10-year-old baseball fanatic as he tries to return Babe Ruth's stolen bat. Largely indifferent to its Depression-era setting, the movie is even less concerned with the need for enchantment. But since this is the last creative collaboration of Christopher and Dana Reeve, the movie's sentimental provenance could earn it a critical pass it doesn't deserve. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis) 'AL FRANKEN: GOD SPOKE' (No rating, 90 minutes) This portrait of the comedian turned liberal polemicist is interesting as a case study in ideological celebrity, but not illuminating enough to be of interest to anyone but Mr. Franken's die-hard loyalists. (A. O. Scott) 'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis) * 'Half Nelson' (R, 107 minutes) In their beautiful bummer about the relationship between a white teacher (Ryan Gosling) and a black student (Shareeka Epps), the gifted young director Ryan Fleck and his writing partner, Anna Boden, offer a lament for the radical fires of the 1960's and a suggestion for life and politics after the new left. (Dargis) 'HAVEN' (R, 98 minutes) Class, race and preposterous narrative contrivance mix it up in the Cayman Islands in this nonlinear nonsense from the producer of ''Crash.'' (Lee) 'HOLLYWOODLAND' (R, 126 minutes) A fictional look at the life and downward-spiraling times of George Reeves, the man who played Superman on television and is here played by a fine Ben Affleck. Allen Coulter directs Paul Bernbaum's screenplay, which features a dead-end parallel plot about a detective (Adrien Brody). (Dargis) 'HOME' (No rating, 78 minutes) In Jeffrey M. Togman's marvelously revealing documentary, Sheree Farmer, a single mother of six, is offered the opportunity to escape her gang-infested neighborhood in Newark. An affordable new home in a safe area awaits; but as the mortgage deadline approaches, and Ms. Farmer's troubles mount, the movie brilliantly illuminates the psychological damage inflicted by years of deprivation. When survival hinges on trusting no one but yourself, the kindness of strangers can seem too good to be true. (Catsoulis) 'HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS' (PG, 98 minutes) The worms go in, the worms go out, but mostly the worms go into the frying pan in Bob Dolman's engaging and yucky adaptation of the Thomas Rockwell book. (Dargis) 'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis) * 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden) * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott) 'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis) 'KEEPING MUM' (R, 90 minutes) Maggie Smith stars as a homicidal housekeeper and a Mary Poppins type in this British black comedy. An old-fashioned movie, it exudes the comfy familiarity of a vintage episode of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' (Holden) 'ARTIE LANGE'S BEER LEAGUE' (R, 86 minutes) Mr. Lange, Howard Stern's radio sidekick, somehow manages to make beer-league softball seem no fun at all in this extremely lowbrow comedy. High point: a brief appearance by the guy who played the beloved and now dead Edgar on ''24.'' (Neil Genzlinger) * 'LASSIE' (PG, 100 minutes) Everything old is new again in the 11th film about the beloved pooch with the I.Q. of a grad student and the instincts of a boomerang. Blissfully restored to the period and location of Eric Knight's original novel -- pre-World War Britain -- the movie balances humor and pathos with old-fashioned charm and not a trace of satire. (Catsoulis) 'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis) * 'MAN PUSH CART' (No rating, 87 minutes) The Sisyphean daily grind of a Pakistani immigrant who sells coffee, doughnuts and bagels from a cart in Midtown Manhattan is an exemplary work of independent filmmaking carried out on a shoestring. At its best, it suggests an American ''Bicycle Thief.'' (Holden) * 'MUTUAL APPRECIATION' (No rating, 110 minutes) Andrew Bujalski's wonderful independent film about friendship in the modern world looks like something that came out of a time capsule, but there's nothing dusty about it. Shot on expressively grainy black-and-white celluloid, it is the sort of unassuming discovery that could suffer from too much big love, and while it won't save or change your life, it may make your heart swell. Its aim is modest and true. (Dargis) * 'OLD JOY' (No rating, 76 minutes) Two old friends drive out of Portland, Ore., one day and into a strained reunion in Kelly Reichardt's ''Old Joy,'' a triumph of modesty and of seriousness that also happens to be one of the finest American films of the year. (Dargis) * 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis) 'SNAKES ON A PLANE' (R, 105 minutes) Snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson. David R. Ellis provides the fine B-movie-style direction, while Mr. Jackson supplies the cool and his trademark epithet. (Dargis) * 'THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED' (No rating, 97 minutes) Kirby Dick, with the help of a private detective, investigates the mysterious workings of the Motion Picture Association of America, a highly secretive, deeply irrational organization with enormous influence over what we see -- and don't see -- on movie screens. (Scott) 'THE U.S. vs JOHN LENNON' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Using archival clips -- including some great ''Dick Cavett Show'' appearances and in-bed news conferences -- and talking-head interviews with Noam Chomsky, G. Gordon Liddy and many people in between, this documentary makes the case that John Lennon was a much better person than Richard Nixon. (Scott) 'VAJRA SKY OVER TIBET' (No rating, 89 minutes) Limited almost exclusively to tourist attractions, this documentary glimpse at the sights and sounds of occupied Tibet amounts to a rhetorically inflated vacation video -- but what a vacation! (Lee) 'the WICKER MAN' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In remaking a 1973 British horror classic, Neil LaBute once again demonstrates his misogyny and, worse, his technical incompetence. (Scott) Film Series THE BEST OF BUSTER: KEATON COMEDY CLASSICS (Through Monday) Film Forum's eight-week festival of the silent comedies of the brilliantly stone-faced Keaton (1895-1966) ends Monday night with ''The Cameraman'' (1928), about a man trying to impress a pretty office worker at MGM, and ''Spite Marriage'' (1929), about a dry cleaner in love with a stage star. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Anita Gates) ÉCLATS DE RIRE (Through Oct. 31) The French Institute Alliance Française is currently screening French comedy classics every Tuesday. This week's film is Francis Veber's odd-couple story ''La Chèvre'' (1981), starring Gérard Depardieu and Pierre Richard as a detective and a publicist on a kidnapping case. Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160; $10. (Gates) MADE IN NY (Through Dec. 31) Tomorrow, just in time for autumn in New York, the Museum of Modern Art begins a three-month series of notable films made in the city. This weekend's five movies include Woody Allen's ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986), whose Manhattan locations include Mia Farrow's Upper West Side apartment, and Spike Lee's ''Do the Right Thing'' (1989), set in a racially charged Brooklyn neighborhood. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) PYTHONALOT (Through Oct. 5) Film Forum's two-week Monty Python festival begins today with a weeklong run of ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' (1975), the Arthurian lunacy that inspired the Broadway musical ''Spamalot.'' Other films in the series include the group's ''Life of Brian'' (1979), Terry Gilliam's ''Brazil'' (1985) and ''A Fish Called Wanda'' (1988), with Michael Palin and John Cleese. 209 West Houston Street, south of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AGENT ORANGE, REAGAN YOUTH (Tomorrow) The clock is ticking for CBGB, the legendary Bowery dive that was the cradle of punk: after a protracted dispute with its landlord, the club must vacate by the end of October. Its last few months have been shaping up as a reunion of the mid-80's class of Hardcore High, which continues tomorrow with the Southern California skate-punk of Agent Orange and members of Reagan Youth, a New York ''anarchy peace punk'' band that, among other things, equated ''the sons of Reagan'' with Nazis. (Its leader, Dave Insurgent, died 13 years ago.) Also on the bill are Freeze, Slacktone and Apple. At 7 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; $20. (Ben Sisario) JOSEPH ARTHUR (Tuesday and Wednesday) Romance, despair and the struggle for faith intermingle in Mr. Arthur's haunting songs, which can float in a gorgeous but eerie acoustic reverie or flare up in electrified anger. His fifth album, ''Nuclear Daydream,'' has just been released on his own label, Lonely Astronaut. With Annie Stela. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18. (Sisario) * ASHFORD AND SIMPSON (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Steve and Eydie of pop-soul still put on a convincing and musically solid show of being the world's happiest show-business couple. At 8:30 and 11, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $60, with a $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden) BOBBY (BLUE) BLAND (Tomorrow) Mr. Bland's voice is a cornerstone of Memphis soul singing. In tones that are velvety, humble and long-suffering, he begs for affection with suave melancholy and smoldering fury. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles) JUSTIN BOND AND THE FREUDIAN SLIPPERS (Tonight) Fresh from a run on Broadway, Justin Bond, the peerlessly raunchy cabaret satirist better known as the Kiki half of Kiki & Herb, offers an account of his career, in music and video. At midnight, Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $25. (Sisario) CIBELLE (Tonight and tomorrow) Cibelle, a young Brazilian who lives in London, follows sensuous melodies into slippery electronic dream realms. And when she interprets the classics, she does it with a free hand: her version of Caetano Veloso's expatriate lament ''London, London'' on her new album ''The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves'' (Six Degrees) seizes on the line about ''flying saucers in the sky,'' adding more than a minute of psychedelic, sci-fi sound effects. Tonight at 7:30 and 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $20. Tomorrow night at 10:30, with Barra Libre, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario) CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH, ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI (Thursday) Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, the grassroots rock success story of 2005 -- this band from Brooklyn sold tens of thousands of CD's of jerky, Talking Heads-inspired art-pop without a record label -- adds another trophy to its case with a performance at Rumsey Playfield in Central Park. If the musical segments on ''Sesame Street'' were made with a chamber orchestra and choir and intended for an audience of hyperintelligent prodigies, they might sound something like Architecture in Helsinki, from Australia: frolicsome and inventive, as if every instrument were being played for the first time. At 5 p.m., midpark at 70th Street, (212) 307-7171; $32.50. (Sisario) ERIC CLAPTON (Thursday) This evergreen guitar hero, now 61, is touring with a repertory stretching back to his Derek and the Dominos era. Also on the bill is Robert Cray, the slick guitarist who was the great commercial hope of the blues in the 1980's. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $49.50 to $154.50. (Sisario) * DENGUE FEVER (Tonight) If you missed Cambodia's wildly eclectic psychedelic rock scene in the 1960's and early 70's (which came to a sudden end with the arrival of the Khmer Rouge), this adventurous Los Angeles band offers the next best thing. Featuring the forceful and entrancing vocals of Chhom Nimol -- a former Cambodian pop star who had been singing in a restaurant in Long Beach, Calif. -- it plays vintage hits and original songs in Khmer and English, toying with a listener's sense of exoticism and familiarity. At 11:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) FLAMING LIPS (Sunday and Monday) The first sign that it will not be the usual rock concert: the place fills with oversize balloons. Next: dancers seemingly dressed as Hebrew prophets. And if another is necessary, the highlight of the night is a cathartic, audience-participation version of ''Bohemian Rhapsody.'' At 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $40. (Sisario) HEM, FREEDY JOHNSTON (Tomorrow) A night of songwriting versus atmosphere. Hem plays somewhat prosaic alt-country, but in such delicate, luscious arrangements that it doesn't matter. Mr. Johnston is a master miniaturist whose elegant, deadpan stories of the lovelorn and the cruel are set to generic and innocuous folk-pop. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $23.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario) JET (Wednesday) Determined to boil rock down to its AC/DC-meets-Guns-N'-Roses essence, this Australian band dismisses anything that distracts from that goal -- including innovation. With Diamond Nights. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario) JOHN BROWN'S BODY (Tomorrow) A reggae band founded in Ithaca, N.Y., John Brown's Body plays old-fashioned reggae, sometimes updated with dub-inspired electronic effects; the results are less ham-fisted than you might think, which isn't saying much. With Club D'Elf and Haale. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, boweryballroom.com, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Kelefa Sanneh) * JACK JONES (Tonight and tomorrow night) In full command of his formidable vocal technique, Mr. Jones, at 68, is arguably the most accomplished singer still standing to work in a Sinatra-descended lounge style as demanding as it is easily parodied. At 9 and 11:30, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $60 cover; $60 prix fixe dinner required at the early shows, $20 minimum at the late shows. (Holden) LOS LOBOS (Thursday) Los Lobos started out in Mexican music, went on to dig deeply into Americana, from blues to country to rhythm and blues to salsa, and then added some twists. Lately a new Latin percussionist has been revitalizing the band. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $30. (Pareles) MEGADETH, LAMB OF GOD, OPETH, ARCH ENEMY (Thursday) The vanguard of heavy metal, past and present. Megadeth's members were steely, cynical soothsayers at a time when the dominant style was poofy hair and power ballads, and they haven't changed a bit. Lamb of God, from Richmond, Va., derives some of its grinding, jackhammer-fast churn from Slayer and Pantera, and, without any irony or sarcasm, calls its style ''pure American metal.'' Opeth, from Sweden, adds intriguing depth to the usual histrionics of black metal with gentle acoustic parts and tough, growly sounds. Arch Enemy, with former members of Carcass, Carnage and Candlemass, reaches back to the glory days of guttural death metal. At 4:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $43. (Sisario) NEW YORK GYPSY FESTIVAL (Sunday) With a thriving rock scene in New York inspired by Gypsy and Eastern European music, a full festival that brings major Gypsy artists from overseas has been badly needed. Most of the action of this second annual series begins next Friday, but on Sunday night a preview offers two bands: Café Antarsia Ensemble, a New York four-piece that plays Greek and Balkan styles and features Ruth Margraff, a playwright and performance artist (7:30 p.m., $15); and Kal, from Serbia, which incorporates rap, Indian bhangra beats, tango and flamenco guitar (9:30 and 11:30 p.m., $22). (Through Oct. 8.) Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com or nygypsyfest.com. (Sisario) BRAD PAISLEY, CARRIE UNDERWOOD (Thursday) Knowing the value of terse composition and sly wordplay, Mr. Paisley scored one of country's biggest hits last year with ''Alcohol.'' A droll defense of grog from the drink's point of view (''I've been known to cause a few breakups/And I've been known to cause a few births''), it is one of the rare novelty songs that outlives its novelty. Ms. Underwood won the fourth season of ''American Idol'' and has sold more than three million copies of her country-pop album ''Some Hearts'' (Arista). At 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; $25 to $53. (Sisario) LEE (SCRATCH) PERRY (Monday) Mr. Perry's quirks are inseparable from his inspirations. He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences. As a performer, he sings and rants, with lucid nuggets surrounded by malarkey as he discourses on space aliens, sex, the International Monetary Fund and marijuana. With Dub Is a Weapon. At 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; $42. (Pareles) RODRIGO Y GABRIELA (Tuesday) Once thrash-metal bandmates in Mexico, this guitar duo discovered what the Gipsy Kings have long known: Europeans and Americans go crazy for virtuosic acoustic renditions of their favorite 70's rock ballads. The Gipsy Kings did it with ''Hotel California,'' and Rodrigo y Gabriela's self-titled new album, on ATO Records, includes a lush ''Stairway to Heaven.'' With Natalie Walker. At 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sisario) ROLLING STONES (Wednesday) It took a fall by Keith Richards from a palm tree in Fiji -- and his subsequent brain surgery -- to slow them down, and even then it was for only a few months. The Stones continue the world tour for ''A Bigger Bang'' (Virgin), their leanest and most acclaimed album in decades. At 8 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $62 to $452. (Sisario) * REGINA SPEKTOR (Wednesday and Thursday) Rhapsodic and sweet, Ms. Spektor's fantasies veer from the childlike to the erotic, in endearingly idiosyncratic piano and vocal parts that can resemble P J Harvey, Billie Holiday or Chopin. With Only Son. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $26.50. (Sisario) ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme song from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her between-song patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show business life. At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Holden) SUNSET RUBDOWN (Sunday and Monday) A solo enterprise of the prolific Spencer Krug, who sings and plays keyboards in the Montreal indie-arty band Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown is one of those weirdly fascinating bedroom noise projects characterized by stompy lo-fi backing tracks and evocative stream-of-consciousness lyrics (''Shut up, I am dreaming of places where lovers have wings''). With Beaver. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) YAT-KHA (Tuesday) Led by musicians from Tuva in southern Siberia, Yat-Kha features the sound of throat singing, the simultaneous production of guttural low notes and their eerily pure overtones. But its leader, Albert Kuvezin, started out playing in rock bands, and Yat-Kha puts some rock beats behind songs about steppes, reindeer, ancient conquerors and pretty girls. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $20. (Pareles) LES YEUX NOIRS (Thursday) This French band finds the common ground between Gypsy music and klezmer: modal dance tunes taken at breakneck speeds, from the crossroads of Europe and the Middle East. At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $21 and $26 in advance, $25 and $30 at the door. (Pareles) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. MICHEL CAMILO AND TOMATITO (Monday through Wednesday) Six years ago, the Dominican pianist Michel Camilo and the Spanish flamenco guitarist known as Tomatito released an ebullient and well-received album called ''Spain'' (Verve). They now have a sequel, fittingly titled ''Spain Again'' (Emarcy); they will reprise their collaboration in a club setting for three nights next week. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $45 at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Nate Chinen) * DIET COKE WOMEN IN JAZZ FESTIVAL (Tonight through Thursday) This monthlong festival of female jazz artists rolls on this weekend with the pianist and singer Eliane Elias, performing music from her recent album, ''Around the City'' (RCA Victor). On Monday and Tuesday the club features the pianist Patrice Rushen in a group with the drummer Terri Lyne Carrington; on Wednesday and Thursday the spotlight shifts to a pair of superb singers, Karrin Allyson and Nancy King, backed by the Bruce Barth Trio. (Through October 1.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, or $10 for after-hours sets, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) * JOHN COLTRANE 80TH-BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Tonight and tomorrow) Countless tenor saxophonists have adapted John Coltrane's sound and style, but few have personalized it more effectively than Joe Lovano, who headlines here with the pianist Steve Kuhn, who briefly worked with Coltrane, and the serious-minded rhythm team of Henry Grimes, bassist, and Andrew Cyrille, drummer. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) KRIS DAVIS QUARTET (Thursday) On her recent album ''The Slightest Shift'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), Kris Davis applies her pianistic and compositional skills to a smart group consisting of Tony Malaby on tenor saxophone, Eivind Opsvik on bass and Jeff Davis on drums, the same group featured here. At 8:30 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12. (Chinen) BILLY DRUMMOND TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow) A resourceful bandleader as well as a versatile drummer, Billy Drummond works here with the pianist Larry Willis and the bassist Eddie Gomez. At 7:30 and 9:15 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) ORRIN EVANS TRIO (Wednesday) Orrin Evans is a pianist with a probing and percussive style, as he reconfirms on an appealingly rugged new release, ''Live in Jackson, Mississippi'' (Imani). He plays here with the rhythm team from the album: Madison Rast on bass and Byron Landham on drums. At 7:30 and 9:15 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; no cover. (Chinen) * FESTIVAL OF NEW TRUMPET MUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This self-descriptive series, organized by Dave Douglas, continues this weekend with the trumpeters Marcus Belgrave, Sean Jones and Greg Glassman, remembering the Detroit drummer Lawrence Williams (tonight); Steven Bernstein's Millennial Territory Orchestra, tackling Don Cherry's 1973 album ''Relativity Suite'' (tomorrow); and Mr. Douglas and Graham Haynes, interpreting more music by Mr. Cherry, who died in 1995 (Sunday). Things gear up again next Thursday with the David Glukh International Ensemble and an ensemble led by Mark Gould. Through Sunday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20.

A full festival schedule is at fontmusic.org. (Chinen) THE FOUR BAGS (Thursday) The instrumental palette of this collaborative quartet -- trombone, accordion, guitar and reeds -- suggests a contemporary sort of chamber jazz. So does the repertory, which includes arrangements of Chopin and Brian Wilson, along with original pieces.

(Chinen) * WYNTON AND LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S HOT FIVES (Thursday) The recordings made by Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five in Chicago in the 1920's are an ageless and inviolable achievement. So while the order of names in this concert title suggests some hubris on the part of Wynton Marsalis, he is indeed the person best suited to give the music a fresh airing. He'll be joined by colleagues like the clarinetist and saxophonist Victor Goines, the trombonists Wycliffe Gordon and Vincent Gardner, the banjoist Don Vappie and the pianist Jonathan Batiste.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow) Updated to the years around World War I, this is one of New York City Opera's best productions, and some fine young talents should make this run of it worth hearing. Shu-Ying Li, the Mimi, has shown a really striking soprano on past occasions; James Valenti, her Rodolfo, was a promising Met Council winner in 2002; Elizabeth Caballero, the Musetta, made a very good City Opera debut last season; and Daniel Mobbs, the Marcello, has been proving himself reliably at Caramoor and elsewhere for several years. George Manahan, the company's music director, conducts. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Anne Midgette) * 'La GiocOnda' (Tuesday) Ponchielli's 1876 ''Gioconda'' can be seen as stuck on a crossroads of Italian opera history. On one level it is a grand opera in the manner of ''Aida.'' Yet in its conventional structure of arias and ensembles it harkens to days of Donizetti. It also anticipates the move toward realism, with its melodramatic story of the street singer Gioconda. The work used to be a staple of all opera houses. The Met is bringing it back for the first time in more than 15 years, with a glittering cast topped by the soprano Violeta Urmana as Gioconda and the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina as Laura. Bertrand de Billy conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Anthony Tommasini) 'Idomeneo' (Thursday) Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's solid old production of Mozart's ''Idomeneo'' returns to the Metropolitan Opera with Ben Heppner singing the title role; Kristine Jepson as Idomeneo's son Idamante; Dorothea Röschmann as Ilya; and Olga Makarina as Elettra. James Levine conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Allan Kozinn) 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Monday) To open its season, the Met returns to Puccini's weepy masterpiece, with big guns firing. The new production is Anthony Minghella's. The company's music boss, James Levine, conducts. And Cristina Gallardo-Domâs, Marcello Giordani and Dwayne Croft take the principal roles. Unsurprisingly, the performance is sold out. At 6:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org. (Bernard Holland) 'THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Diminutive and beloved, the sexagenarian Amato Opera proves that, in opera, tradition and devotion can prevail over quality. It's remarkable that all of Mozart's characters can fit on the theater's tiny stage. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Midgette) 'SEMELE' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The New York City Opera's Handel series continues with a first-rate update evoking Marilyn Monroe, the Kennedys and the kind of sex and violence that Ovid's original gods and goddesses might have understood. Elizabeth Futral takes the title role. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Holland) * 'die tote stadt' (Sunday and Wednesday) Erich Wolfgang Korngold's renown as the composer of swashbuckling film scores for Hollywood hits of the 1930's like ''Captain Blood'' and ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' has understandably overwhelmed his early work as an early-20th-century German modernist. At least his 1920 opera ''Die Tote Stadt'' lingers at the margins of the repertory. The New York City Opera revives Frank Corsaro's production of this psychological mystery about a man obsessed with his saintly dead wife, Marie, and who is spooked when he chances upon a look-alike, a sultry temptress and actress named Marietta. Sunday at 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Tommasini) Classical Music Babi Yar Commemoration (Wednesday) The Museum of Jewish Heritage will commemorate the 65th anniversary of the Jewish massacre at Babi Yar in Kiev with ''Babi Yar Remembered: Yevtushenko and Shostakovich in Word and Song.'' The program features a reading by the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, while Misha and Cipa Dichter perform the world premiere of Shostakovich's two-piano version of his Symphony No. 13, ''Babi Yar,'' with full male chorus and Valentin Peytchinov, a bass.

Ensemble (Monday) The alluring Spiegeltent has been host to a parade of adventurous performers and music this summer as part of the Darmstadt Classics of the Avant-Garde series. The momentum continues on Monday with Petr Kotik's intrepid new-music S.E.M. Ensemble, which will play works including Xenakis's ''Dikhthas'' and ''Mikka''; Stockhausen's ''Zeitmasse''; A. Vincent Raikhel's ''go to, go by''; and Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra, with Joseph Kubera as soloist. One of Mr. Kotik's own works, ''Wilsie Bridge,'' is also on the lineup.

(Erika Kinetz) * FALL FOR DANCE (Thursday) Only in its third year but clearly the king of New York's late summer/early fall dance samplers, Fall for Dance is offering its regular 30 companies and 6 programs, but this year expands to 10 performances, with 4 of the programs repeated. Each program, from Thursday through Oct. 8, includes five wildly diverse and often famous companies in short dances that ideally build to a satisfying whole, aside from the excellence of any individual offering. Thursday's opening program, repeated next Friday, has the Korean Yi-Jo Lim Sun Dance Company, the Dutch National Ballet, Bill T. Jones, Trisha Brown and the Pennsylvania Ballet. At 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $10.

(Dunning) NOÉMIE LAFRANCE'S 'AGORA II' (Tomorrow, Saturday, Wednesday and Thursday) Apparently, Ms. LaFrance, a tireless artistic explorer of public space, is a glutton for punishment. Having moved bureaucratic mountains last year to stage ''Agora'' in the enormous (and empty) McCarren Park pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she now has a sequel, ''Agora II,'' which incorporates a number of guest companies and is described in the publicity materials as ''a choreographic game for 1,000 bodies.'' Good luck to them all. At 8 p.m. (arrive by 7:30), McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street, between Driggs and Bayard Streets, (718) 388-6309, sensproduction.org; $20 and $30.

(Dunning) ELKE RINDFLEISCH (Tonight and tomorrow night) In Ms. Rindfleisch's new ''Damage,'' six dancers will struggle through a spreading inner disturbance, to rock music by Chris Woltmann, performed live. They end up nowhere, the choreographer says, or in places of unexpected tenderness in a set that fills the performance space with small alternative spaces. At 8, Wallabout Studio, 50 Taaffe Place, between Flushing and Park Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (917) 251-4561, rindfleischdance.com; $15.

Museums BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE,' through Oct. 15. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show has been drawn mostly from the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and overseen by the head of the museum's medieval department and its object conservator in collaboration with Bard graduate students. But don't worry about dryness. The aquamanile's triple function as totem, prestige object and pitcher lends it an undeniable energy. The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art; a versatile repertory of incised details and patterns; and a continuing, rarely resolved struggle between form and function. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu. (Roberta Smith) Brooklyn Museum: 'Looking Back from Ground Zero: Images from the Brooklyn Museum Collection,' through Dec. 27. This show presents a historical picture of Lower Manhattan from early on to the present, with the building of the World Trade Center as the pivotal point. A short film, ''Building the World Trade Center,'' produced by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1983, is an invaluable document of the triumphalist spin surrounding the construction of the complex. A small selection of artworks produced in or just after 2001 hints at the profound and conflicted feelings the destruction of the twin towers has evoked. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Holland Cotter) Dia:Beacon: 'Agnes Martin: A Field of Vision: Paintings from the 1980's,' through March 5. Dia:Beacon has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin. Over the last two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. The fourth installment is now in place. If Ms. Martin's spare, lucid compositions of drawn lines and painted bands feel different from much of the art around them here, that is because she was not a Minimalist. In fact, she called herself an Abstract Expressionist, and she was adamant on this point. The 18 paintings here confirm her conviction, in a show as deep, light-glinting, restless and purposeful as the river flowing nearby. Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, www.diacenter.org. (Cotter) International Center of Photography: 'Ecotopia: The Second I.C.P. Triennial of Photography and Video,' through Jan. 7. Punctuated by big black oozing forms that are both comic and ominous, this edifying, entertaining, ecologically aware exhibition is a walk-through version of Al Gore's ''Inconvenient Truth.'' The work on view represents nearly 40 artists and photojournalists and portrays nature as variously ravishing, cute and enduring, and also increasingly dangerous and endangered, thanks to the widening scope of human indifference and exploitation. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith) * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Brush and Ink: The Chinese Art of Writing,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) The Met: 'CÉzanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde,' through Jan. 7. The come-on title of this show turns out to be slightly misleading. The star is not any of the artists. It is a dealer, Ambroise Vollard, born in 1866, arrived in Paris in 1887 from the Île de la Réunion. The works in the show are eye candy, sure, but they also passed through Vollard's hands. Picasso bought a Matisse still life and a Renoir bather from Vollard. They're both here. So is Cézanne's ''Bathers,'' which Monet bought; and Cézanne's ''Battle of Love,'' which Renoir got. What's worth noting are less the landmarks than the byways: a Renoir portrait of Vollard dressed as a torero. And some Matisses, from before 1904, when Vollard organized a Matisse show, which tanked, document a genius whose imminent breakthrough Vollard missed. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) * THE MUSEUM AT F.I.T.: 'LOVE AND WAR: THE WEAPONIZED WOMAN,' through Dec. 16. From a museum known for elucidating both the erotic and architectural nature of clothing design, this characteristically handsome exhibition examines the influence of garments of love and seduction (lingerie) and of war (armor and military uniforms) on modern and contemporary couturiers. The Museum at F.I.T., Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, (212) 217-5800, fitnyc.edu/museum. (Smith) National Academy Museum: 'Luminist Horizons: The Art and Collection of James A. Suydam,' through Dec. 31. Mr. Suydam is remembered, if at all, as a 19th-century American Luminist painter whose reputation has all but sunk quietly into the New England salt meadows that he loved to paint. This exhibition has a few aims, one of which is a kind of art historical search and rescue operation. Mr. Suydam's early works were painted in a smooth Luminist style compatible with his material, pleasantly detached scenes of rural tranquillity or calm seas beneath hazy skies. His masterwork, ''Paradise Rocks, Newport'' (1860), is an expansive, low-tide view of a wide, flat beach, meadow and distant rising rocks along the Rhode Island shoreline. The paintings in this show remind us that Mr. Suydam -- and his fellow Luminists -- were an extremely talented group who helped bring a measure of sensitivity, subtlety and poetry to the American landscape tradition. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Benjamin Genocchio) NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer, through Oct 9. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman) RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter) Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Nadine Robinson: Alles Grau,' 'Quid Pro Quo: Rashawn Griffin, Karyn Olivier and Clifford Owen: 2005-06 Artists-in-Residence,' and 'Beyond Sight,' through Oct. 22. The Studio Museum in Harlem is looking sharp with three concurrent shows, the outstanding one being a single big sound-sculpture by Nadine Robinson. It expands her political purview from imperialism to Armageddon, with hundreds of speakers embedded in an 11-foot-high gray-black wall unit that generate a sampling of satanic film scores (''The Omen,'' ''The Matrix''), mixed with funeral chants and Rastafarian dance music. ''Quid Pro Quo'' is a showcase for the 2005-6 artists in residence, all interdisciplinarians with a sweet-and-sour Dadaist touch. Mr. Owens, with performance, looks intriguingly volatile. And you won't want to leave the museum without checking out ''Beyond Sight,'' the work of the 14 teenagers. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseuminharlem.org. (Cotter) Queen Sofía Spanish Institute: 'Albert Ràfols-Casamada, Paintings, 1950-2005,' through next Friday. This institute has devoted its two galleries to a half-century survey of the Spanish painter Albert Ràfols-Casamada. Blocky, indistinct shapes floating in broad expanses of watery color are the rule, for Mr. Ràfols-Casamada is a devotee of a brand of soft-edge, gesture-oriented, color-loving abstraction that was very chic in the 1950's and 60's. If there is something original about Mr. Ràfols-Casamada's work, it is his feathery layering of paint. In 1963 he started making use of collage. His ambition is nothing much greater than this: eye-pleasing pictures suffused with harmony, rhythm and balanced color relations. 84 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 628-0420, queensofiaspanishinstitute.org. (Genocchio) Galleries: Uptown * ONE WAY OR ANOTHER: ASIAN AMERICAN ART NOW, through Dec. 10. Taking its name from a 1978 hit by the punk band Blondie, this lively exhibition finds a new vitality and freedom, especially where identity is involved, in Asian-American art. The artists' roots range from Iran to Korea; their mediums include painting, drawing, sculpture, video, photography and performance. Keep a special eye out for Mari Eastman's wryly beautiful paintings; Mika Tajima's glamorous deconstruction of Minimalism; and the video-performance efforts of Patty Chang, Laurel Nakadate and Xavier Cha. An added bonus: 12, or 71 percent, of the show's 17 artists are women. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Smith) ANDY WARHOL: MAO Whoever added the colors and brushwork to Andy Warhol's silkscreen images of the Chairman, now 30 years dead, seems to have been having a good time. The surfaces have more life than usual for the master of art-as-business production, even if the show lacks one of Warhol's really, really big Maos. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, through Oct. 7. (Smith) Galleries: 57th Street ALEXI WORTH: COUPLES A prominent bald head, somewhere between a boxed-in apple by Magritte and the smooth pate of a de Chirico mannequin, dominates several of these quirky paintings, which are as notable for the weirdness ascribed to both representation and human relations as for the discreet formalism of space, scale, tone and surface (Smith). DC Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 247-2111, through Oct. 7. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea TOMOO GOKITA: DRUNKO A whiz at drawing, this Tokyo-based artist is making his New York solo debut with a show of his first paintings, executed in black and white gouache on canvas. The best are full of strange squiggles and doodles that suggest the elements of an Yves Tanguy Surrealist landscape swept into a messy pile, like entrails. ATM Gallery, 619 West 27th Street, (212) 375-0349, atmgallery.com, through Oct. 14. (Smith) * AXEL KASSEBÖHMER Not all German painters come from Leipzig. This New York debut and 15-year sampling introduces one whose work suggests the painting-as-paint strictures of Gerhard Richter (with whom he studied) filtered through the blunt land- and seascape abbreviations of artists like Emil Nolde and (to American eyes) Milton Avery. They convey a mystical yet flat-footed physicality, a penchant for sly references to the history of textiles and ceramics and an impressive range of causes and effects. Klemens Gasser & Tanja Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212) 807-6594, gassergrunert.net, through Oct. 14. (Smith) 'Street Poets & Visionaries: Selections from the UbuWeb Collection' Poetic is the word for the text-based work that Kenneth Goldsmith has assembled for this group show. Printed copies of shaped poems by David Daniels, a West Coast artist now in his 70's, make up about half of what's here. Most of the rest is anonymous urban ''outsider'' material picked up over the years by Mr. Goldsmith from the street and digitally archived as the UbuWeb Collection (ubu.com). Over all, the content is idiosnyncratic, to say the very least: obessional, paranoic, splenetic, militant, millenarian and just plain psychically intense in a way that art in Chelsea rarely feels. Oliver Kamm/5BE Gallery, 621 West 27th Street, (212) 255-0979, 5begallery.com, through Oct. 14. (Cotter) Alison Elizabeth Taylor This artist's wood veneer inlay images dwell on the darker side of the suburban idyll. Sexual tension, waste, bigotry and violence underlie their luxurious-looking surfaces, along with a gnawing estrangement from nature: in this case, mostly the desert landscape around Las Vegas, where Ms. Taylor grew up. Couples and small groups of people embody fractured, ambiguous relationships in her carefully constructed marquetry ''paintings.'' James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com, through Sept. 30. (Genocchio) Other Galleries 'Moving Pictures: American Art and Early Film, 1880-1910' What's thought to be the first movie kiss, between May Irwin and John C. Rice, occurred in 1896, photographed by the Edison Manufacturing Company as the subject of a 19-second film shown at a New York music hall. It and dozens of other early movie treasures, along with fine art of the period, are shown in this engrossing if learned survey of the links between the earliest movies and other American visual art forms at the turn of the 20th century. A vital part of the show is the section devoted to the body in motion. It reveals how the work of Eadweard Muybridge, the English-born, California-based photographer who did studies of humans and animals in movement, played an important role in the development of motion pictures. Throughout the show, provocative juxtapositions are made of films and paintings by Thomas Eakins, Maurice Prendergast,and John Sloan, among others. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, www.nyu.edu/greyart, through Dec. 9. (Glueck) Last Chance COOPER HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'YINKA SHONIBARE SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION' A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 or ndm.si.edu; closes on Sunday. (Johnson) * STUART HAWKINS: CUSTOMS The latest series of daffy photographs by this American artist working in Nepal rarely reflects well on Western tourists. Too stagy to be snapshots and too haphazard to be completely planned, they parlay familiar travel terms like ''Day Driver,'' ''Field Notes,'' ''Welcome Drink'' and ''Medicine Kit'' into bizarre sitcoms.

(Johnson) * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED' In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this season, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included.

(Smith) P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Into Me/Out of Me' Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum.

2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Cuba is well known for its wonderful ballet dancers and for the enthusiasm that classical dance excites among its the population; it's often said that ballet is as popular as soccer in Fidel Castro's domain. In a new exhibition, ''Dance in Cuba,'' that began last week at the Library of the Performing Arts, the photographer Gil Garcetti reveals several other sides to the country's proclivity for dance. Mr. Garcetti is not a dance photographer; he was the Los Angeles County district attorney and has published two books of architectural photography and one about a television show. This may be an advantage: unlike much dance photography that seeks out moments of perfect line or poise, this exhibition shows both a human face and the sheer joy of movement, and Mr. Garcetti's architectural eye is apparent in the beautifully composed images. The 59 photographs on display are taken from Mr. Garcetti's book of the same name (published last year by Balcony Press) and were shot over several visits between 2001 and 2004. They document children at the many free dance schools in Cuba, professional ballet and contemporary dancers in studio rehearsals (including a 2004 portrait of a dancer with the Danza Contemporánea de Cuba, above), and, perhaps most compellingly, ordinary people dancing in public spaces. An overwhelming sense of vitality bursts through Mr. Garcetti's black-and-white photographs, which also offer tantalizing hints about life in Cuba. In the first picture on view, lush tropical foliage provides the backdrop to an alluringly coiled dancer on an uneven wooden floor. In another, the taut and touching elegance of four young students contrasts with their shabby, worn surroundings. And in the photographs of public revelry -- an elderly couple performing with panache, -- reveal a sense of life lived with an enviable intensity. ''Every day is a struggle,'' Viengsay Valdés, a prima ballerina with the Ballet Nacional de Cuba, is quoted as saying in the book. ''But we dance and we forget about all that.''

Dr. Huvos was internationally acknowledged for his expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of bone tumors. His description of the features of chemotherapeutic response in the treatment of osteogenic sarcoma, the most common bone tumor in children, represents, to date, the standard for predicting prognosis. He was also a widely recognized expert on the diagnosis and treatment of various head and neck tumors, especially tumors of the salivary gland. He first came to Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases in 1967 as a fellow in oncologic pathology, was offered a position as chief fellow the following year, and joined the staff in 1969. At the time of his death, Dr. Huvos was an Attending Pathologist and Member of Memorial Hospital. During 37 years at the Center, thousands of patients had the benefit of his gifts as a pathologist, and his work will continue to benefit patients with cancer in the future. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife and family. Douglas A. Warner III, Chairman Boards of Overseers and Managers Richard I. Beattie, Vice Chairman Harold Varmus, President John R.

Dr. Huvos joined the staff of Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases in 1969 and rose to become Attending Pathologist and Member of Memorial Hospital, ranks that he held at the time of his death. He was one of the world's foremost authorities on the surgical pathology of bone tumors and neoplasms of the salivary glands and other sites in the head and neck. Few pathologists contributed as much to the charting of these lesions' clinical biology and to the difficult issues of their classification and prognostic assessment. He was the author of 400 peer-reviewed, original contributions to the literature, as well as the author of a classic textbook on the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of bone tumors. Dr. Huvos was the recipient of many honors, including the prestigious Henry L. Jaffe Award in Orthopedic Pathology, and the President's Medal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology. An ardent teacher. Dr. Huvos mentored hundreds of students who ensure that his legacy will span generations, and his keen intellect, creativity, and personal warmth will be missed by all who knew him. Robert E.

2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Thai Coup Disrupts Film Art took a back seat to life in Bangkok, where the filming of a thriller starring Nicolas Cage, right, was interrupted by the military coup that deposed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand, The Associated Press reported. Citing the Chinese news Web site Sina.com, the report said Mr. Cage had prepared a private jet to leave the country on short notice after he was sent back to his hotel when news of the coup on Tuesday night reached the crew. According to the report, some members of the crew of the film, a remake by the Hong Kong twins Danny and Oxide Pang of their 1999 movie, ''Bangkok Dangerous,'' remained on the set to protect the prop guns, but Mr. Cage persuaded the producer to send everyone home. The news report said filming had been scheduled to be completed next month but may be delayed by the coup. Cameron Diaz Accuses Photographer of Assault Cameron Diaz, below, has filed a police report that accuses a photographer of driving his car toward her and her boyfriend, Justin Timberlake, forcing her to jump out of the way, The Associated Press reported. Describing the events that led to the complaint of assault with a deadly weapon, Officer April Harding of the Los Angeles police said the couple were leaving a friend's home in Hollywood just after midnight on Wednesday, when a photographer jumped out of bushes and tried to take their picture. The officer said they chased the photographer ''a short distance'' before he ''got into his car and drove toward Diaz and Timberlake, causing Diaz to jump out of the car's way.'' No one was arrested, and no suspects were identified. Under a new law, photographers who engage in criminal acts to get a picture may be liable for three times the damage they cause as well as the loss of any profits from the published photo. Proof's Killer Convicted The man who shot and killed the rapper Proof in an after-hours Detroit nightclub in April has been convicted on weapons charges, The Associated Press reported. The gunman, Mario Etheridge, 28, below, said by the authorities to have been acting in lawful defense of another man, was found guilty of carrying a concealed weapon and discharging a firearm inside a building. The authorities said Mr. Etheridge shot and killed Proof, 32, whose real name was Deshaun Holton, after Proof fatally shot Mr. Etheridge's cousin, Keith Bender, in what Mr. Etheridge's lawyer said was a dispute over a game of pool. The Wayne County prosecutor, Kym Worthy, said Mr. Etheridge shot twice at the ceiling to try to stop Proof before aiming at him. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 17, when Mr. Etheridge, who has no prior criminal record, could receive probation.

2006-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Chaos meets chaos at the Andrea Rosen Gallery, where the British-born artist Matthew Ritchie presents his version of a prophecy of world destruction precipitated by a shadowy entity referred to only as the Universal Adversary. The narrative is oblique, mostly gestured at through a theatrical display of kaleidoscopic paintings, a hanging black aluminum latticework sky, a video piece and a 40-foot-long box of illuminated lenticular images. (Left, Mr. Ritchie's ''God of Catastrophe.'') It took rigging and installation crews almost two weeks to set up the show. This artist's vision of doomsday is shaped less by any impending environmental or political crisis than by science fiction, mysticism and myth, with the cover of the exhibition invitation quoting from the biblical book of Ezekiel. (The author was a sixth century B.C. Jewish priest who prophesized God's judgment on a nation of lapsed worshipers.) True believers and the brave can ascend to the top of the latticework sky courtesy of a rickety spiral staircase, where there is a suspended viewing platform leading to an oculus, on which is a projection of a parallel world with different digital views of an imaginary city set to the sound of a voice (God's?) reading from religious books and the artist's writings. The precise meaning of all this stuff is not easy to grasp, but somehow or another together it feels agonizingly pertinent.

Investigators said at that time that she had participated because three of her brothers had been killed in Iraq. Ms. Rishawi showed little emotion in the packed courtroom as the verdict was read. Under the law, death sentences are automatically appealed. SUHA MAAYEH (NYT)"

2006-09-23T00:00:00Z,"This 30-second advertisement for John Faso, the Republican candidate for governor, began running yesterday on upstate broadcast and cable stations. PRODUCER -- Greener and Hook. ON THE SCREEN -- A single, dying light bulb hangs from a cord in darkness, buzzing on and off, as the announcer's words appear in a jagged font that recalls the violent slasher movie ''Saw.'' A gray image of Eliot Spitzer, looking mean, appears with the words ''special interest friends,'' ''spending'' and ''taxes.'' With the final words of the ad, an outstretched hand reaches up and clicks off the flickering bulb. THE SCRIPT -- A sober-sounding female announcer says: ''New Yorkers already pay some of the highest taxes in the nation. Our kids are moving elsewhere for better jobs. And some can't even afford to pay the taxes on their homes. Now candidate Eliot Spitzer is making promises to his special-interest friends. Almost $70 billion in new spending. His new spending will mean thousands more in new taxes for every New York family. If Eliot Spitzer gets his way, it may be time for the last one in upstate New York to turn out the light.'' ACCURACY -- New York State taxes are relatively high, and both candidates say that young people and homeowners are abandoning the state. Mr. Spitzer has promised to increase spending on education by $4 billion to $6 billion and has proposed expanding health care and investing in transportation projects, among other things. But his campaign disputes Mr. Faso's estimate of $70 billion over four years, saying it will be only $8 billion to $10 billion a year at most. Mr. Spitzer has proposed $11 billion in budget cuts and $6 billion in property tax cuts, and has said he has no intention of raising taxes. Mr. Faso, an experienced budget analyst from his days as an Assembly leader, says there is no way Mr. Spitzer can deliver so much new spending without raising taxes. SCORECARD -- This is Mr. Faso's first ad of the general election, and it is a doozy: Rather than introduce himself or present an optimistic message -- both political rules of thumb -- the Faso campaign turns darkly negative and suggests that upstate is on death's door. Yet Mr. Faso clearly believes that shock value is what he needs. He is a staggering 50 percentage points behind Mr. Spitzer in the polls; if Mr. Faso cannot boost his own positive ratings quickly, then he must tear down Mr. Spitzer's. The ad is running only upstate, and an antitax message has traditionally been popular in that Republican voter base (though Democrats have made inroads). The pessimism in the ad may turn off some viewers, but it will resonate with others and leave the impression (fairly or not) that Mr. Spitzer will raise taxes. PATRICK HEALY"

After World War II, he joined Archer Daniels Midland Co., an agricultural products firm then based in Minneapolis, where he served in various capacities for 50 years. He became President and CEO of ADM in 1958. He served on ADM's Board of Directors from 1958 through 1996, performing as Chairman of the Board from 1968 through 1972. He also served as a member of the Executive Committee.

2006-09-23T00:00:00Z,"A 30-second commercial for Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, began running statewide yesterday on broadcast and cable television stations. PRODUCER -- Jimmy Siegel. ON THE SCREEN -- The ad begins with a close-up of Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic candidate for governor, speaking about Mr. Cuomo. The close-up shots alternate with a screen filled with Mr. Spitzer's words about Mr. Cuomo, including ''Rooted out corruption,'' ''Fought bigotry and gun violence'' and ''Most qualified.'' THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Spitzer appears on screen and is the only voice in the ad. He states: ''You don't judge a fighter by how many times he wins, but who he beats. When Andrew Cuomo turned around a troubled agency under Bill Clinton, he was in charge of 300 lawyers who took on very powerful interests, demonstrating the kind of fearlessness that got him confirmed twice by the U.S. Senate, by both parties. He rooted out corruption. Stopped the bad guys. Fought everything from bigotry to gun violence. Which is why he's the most qualified to be your next attorney general. Because he not only has the experience and integrity. He's got the guts.'' ACCURACY -- The advertisement includes well-documented information about Mr. Cuomo's years as Secretary of Housing in the administration of President Bill Clinton. Under Mr. Cuomo's leadership, the department did undertake a number of antidiscrimination housing suits. But the agency also came under fire when one of its signature programs, meant to improve housing in poor neighborhoods, turned out to be riddled with fraud and left some areas in worse shape than they had been. SCORECARD -- This is Mr. Cuomo's first television commercial since winning the Democratic primary on Sept. 12. And as such, it is the first time he has been able to use the political cachet of Mr. Spitzer, who enjoys wide popularity, even among Republicans. For voters who see Mr. Spitzer as an authoritative, reliable voice, it will undoubtedly help lend gravitas to the Cuomo campaign in the wake of a bruising primary. By highlighting how many lawyers worked under Mr. Cuomo, it also seeks to undercut criticism about his lack of legal experience. While the ads by his Republican opponent, Jeanine F. Pirro, attacked the Democratic candidate, the Cuomo ad does not mention Ms. Pirro. Republican politicians, however, will undoubtedly see Mr. Spitzer's claims of ''fearlessness'' as hyperbole.

''Some of those upset with the council's decision have compared it to hypothetically inviting Hitler to a meeting in the 1930's,'' the ambassador, Daniel Ayalon, wrote to the council's president, Richard N. Haass. ''In fact, meeting with Ahmadinejad is worse: Hitler did not openly call for genocide in the 1930's, and today we have the lessons of the 1930's to guide us.

It topped the premiere of CBS's Thursday goliath, ''CSI,'' by 45 percent in the vaunted demographic of adults 18 to 49. ''CSI'' drew a formidable 22 million total viewers, although that figure was down 24 percent from last year's debut. NBC's premiere of ''ER'' led at 10 p.m. with 15.6 million viewers.

2006-09-23T00:00:00Z,"Should the developers scale back the proposed -- and mammoth -- Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn by 6 percent to 8 percent, as recent reports suggest they might be considering, the decision would hardly be novel. Indeed, history teems with myriad similar, if less subtle, downsizings. New York World's Fair, 1940 The 1939-40 New York World's Fair wore a new look in its second year, exemplified by the Trylon and Most of the Perisphere, as the giant symbol became officially known. The balance sheet was seriously out of balance, and the belt-tightening that followed spared nothing. On a rosier note, converting 1939 Bakelite replicas of the original Trylon and Perisphere into 1940 versions spread like wildfire as a hobbyist activity. H.M.S. Flotsam, 1921 Cutting costs to the bone on the fiercely competitive North Atlantic route led Britain's Washing Line to institute an across-the-board 6 to 8 percent reduction in building costs for its new liner. The 6 to 8 percent shorter hull was assembled with 6 to 8 percent fewer rivets -- an all too vital element, as it turned out, in the technical condition that master shipbuilders call buoyancy. Tasmania, 1957 An austerity-minded new island government cut administrative costs by lopping 6 to 8 percent from Tasmania's official size. Those marooned without utilities or public services had to pay $20,000 each for readmission to the mainland -- creating an overnight budget surplus and restoring the island's missing 6 to 8 percent. Alas, the costs of defending against a tsunami of related lawsuits forced the government to revoke the revocation, and official Tasmania today remains only 92 to 94 percent of its former self. Eiffel Tower, 1949 The government of economically ailing France first switched to ''Liberté, Égalité, Austérité'' as the nation's new motto and then downsized the Eiffel Tower by a symbolic 6 to 8 percent to imprint the seriousness of the situation on the minds of the citizenry. Tourists can visit the missing top of the structure in a suburban Paris storage bin -- for a fee, of course. Bust of Fungus Bulbous, A.D. 213 After the hard-bargaining Roman land developer Fungus Bulbous chiseled the bill for a marble bust of himself down by 6 to 8 percent, the resentful sculptor chiseled the bust down by the same amount, right where it showed. Pyramid of Chops, 2500 B.C. Budget cuts in the Department of the Afterlife forced the Pharaoh Cheops -- snidely known thereafter as Chops -- to slash the cost of his eternal resting place by making it the Egyptian equivalent of 6 to 8 percent less massive. His royal architect, archeologists agree, did a ham-handed job of it."

2006-09-23T00:00:00Z,"The sculptor who created a 7,000-pound charging bull sculpture that has become a favorite tourist photo stop at the foot of Broadway has filed suit in federal court in Manhattan against Wal-Mart, complaining that it is selling lithographs of his work without his permission. Arturo Di Modica, who made the sculpture with his own money as a tribute to America's rebound from the 1987 stock market crash, also sued several other companies for what he described as unauthorized use of his work, including North Fork Bank, which has used an image of the bull in a television advertising campaign, the lawsuit said. In the dead of the night in December 1989, Mr. Di Modica used a truck and crane to bequeath the fierce-looking sculpture illegally to the Wall Street area, plunking it down near the New York Stock Exchange. It was hauled away but was later returned by the city's Parks Department and installed in nearby Bowling Green, where it has remained. In 1998 Mr. Di Modica registered the bull with the United States Copyright Office. For many years he has sought to recoup his costs for the work by selling it to someone who will agree to leave it where it now stands. John Simley, a spokesman for Wal-Mart, said the company had not yet been served with papers in the case and would wait to comment. RANDY KENNEDY"

Loved and respected also by the spouses and children of all the above, he represented the last vestige of his generation to his large extended family. Nathaniel Lubell was born in 1916. He graduated from the City College of New York, where he first began to achieve renown as a world-class fencer. His 1936 CCNY Fencing Team won the New York City Championships, and he is a member of the CCNY Athletic Hall of Fame. He went on to become a three-time Olympian ( 1948, '52 and '56 ). He was the U.S. National Foil Champion in 1948, and at the 1951 Pan American Games, he won the bronze medal in the individual foil and helped the team capture the gold medal in the team foil and saber. He was a lifelong member of The New York Fencers' Club, serving as its President during the 1970's. He also coached fencing at West Point from 1962-1966. Fiercely independent and aggressively iconoclastic, his acerbic wit and characteristic irascibility were a source of considerable family lore. He was an institution among his many descendants, and he will be greatly missed."

The show, which runs through Jan. 1, features a variety of works, including ''The Kiss,'' ''The Thinker,'' left, and ''The Gates of Hell,'' inspired by Dante's ''Inferno.'' Many of the works, organized around 10 chronological themes, are on loan from the Musée Rodin in Paris and from Rodin's home in Meudon, a Paris suburb. Several are being shown outside of France for the first time. Another Cancellation For Reggae Singer In response to complaints from patrons, the Highlands Hollywood nightclub and restaurant in Los Angeles has canceled a performance, scheduled for Oct. 2, by the reggae singer Buju Banton, The Associated Press reported. Some of Mr. Banton's songs include violent lyrics about gay men and lesbians; ''Batty Rider'' and ''Boom Bye Bye'' glorify the shooting of gay men. Mr. Banton has caused controversy before: in July, for example, protests forced the cancellation of a scheduled performance at Concorde 2 in Brighton, the English seaside resort. ''We felt it was the right thing to do after doing some research on the matter,'' said Adam Manacker, the director of promotions for Highlands, speaking of the Hollywood cancellation.

2006-09-23T00:00:00Z,"Even 200-year-old political cartoons aren't immune from the PBS censor's blurring machine when they depict naked male genitalia. David Grubin, the writer, producer and director of ''Marie Antoinette,'' a documentary portrait of the French queen, right, to be broadcast on Monday night, was asked this week by PBS stations to blur the images on two phantasmagorical political cartoons shown in the film. The fear was that, unedited, they would violate the Federal Communications Commission's indecency standards. Mr. Grubin said in an interview that he found the requested changes ''disturbing,'' but that he wasn't upset with the stations. ''I don't blame them,'' he said. ''The fines are $325,000, and that could bankrupt a station.'' The F.C.C.'s policy of ruling on indecency issues only after it receives complaints ''is forcing filmmakers and PBS to censor ourselves because we can't risk the fines,'' he said. Stations were not concerned about other cartoons in the film that show the queen's bare breasts, which will not be obscured. In August PBS rescinded a policy it had put in place in May that required its filmmakers to not only bleep out offensive language but also to obscure digitally the mouth of the person uttering the offensive word, so that viewers would not be able to read lips. Filmmakers had complained that PBS's policy went too far. ELIZABETH JENSEN"

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: As company historian for Levi Strauss & Company, I was intrigued by Ita Aber's letter (Sept. 3) regarding''Jeans: A Cultural History of an American Icon.'' For some reason the history of jeans lends itself to legends and misinformation, even when a new book has all the facts straight. So, in the interest of historical accuracy, I would respectfully like to correct the letter writer as follows: a) Levi Strauss was never married; b) Levi Strauss never went to Provence; c) He obtained all of his denim from American textile mills; and d) Denim was originally called serge de Nîmes, a name that was anglicized in the United States as early as the 18th century. For more -- and accurate -- information about the history of denim and jeans, I suggest readers go to the ''heritage'' section of our Web site at www.levistrauss.com. Lynn Downey San Francisco"
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In Michelle Higgins's ''Air Travel: What to Do When Bumped From a Flight'' (Practical Traveler, Sept. 10), it was mentioned that some airlines have computerized systems to reassign travelers to other flights -- systems that are faster and fairer than having airline employees manually reassign passengers. The article goes on to imply that choosing an airline that ''still rewards those with sharp elbows'' is not such a bad idea. Why would I want to reward an airline for unfair, inefficient behavior? I'd rather travel on one that doesn't give selfish troublemakers better access to coveted seats, and instead uses a fair system to allocate such scarce resources. Shaun Breidbart Pelham, N.Y."

Each must also complete a practice round of five judging assignments in the breed. Group judges must be qualified in all breeds in a group, and best-in-show judges must be qualified in at least one of the seven groups and have judged that group at least five times. The process can take years of watching dogs and slowly developing a sure eye."

Restaurant renovations are just as popular, a case in point being Trattoria Grasso, which reinvented itself in July as Grasso's Fine Dining and Jazz. The changes here are more than cosmetic. This is no longer a casual Italian cafe but an upscale American restaurant. The menu features steaks, chops and fish with a few Asian spins, like ahi tuna crusted with sesame seeds and accompanied by mango relish and wasabi mashed potatoes, or an appetizer of mussels steamed with coconut milk, red curry paste and lemon grass. At the bottom of the menu, almost as a postscript, are five entrees labeled ''always-available favorites.''

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Emily Bazelon, in her otherwise lucid review of my book ''Not a Suicide Pact: The Constitution in a Time of National Emergency'' (Sept. 10), says that I neglect to mention that President Lincoln issued his order unconstitutionally suspending habeas corpus ''when Congress was in recess, and sought approval for it upon the Legislature's return to Washington.'' In fact, I state on Page 39 of my book that when Lincoln suspended habeas corpus ''Congress was not in session, and there is an argument for recognizing an implicit presidential authority to suspend habeas corpus when Congress is unable to do so but the public safety requires that it be done.'' (Congress's subsequent acquiescence could mitigate but not expunge the constitutional violation.) I go on to note that Lincoln claimed the right to violate the suspension clause in an emergency (Page 40), and that he refused to obey a habeas corpus order issued by the chief justice of the United States (Page 85). Bazelon's oversight is not important in itself; what is important is that we understand that a great president claimed a moral right to violate the Constitution in circumstances of dire necessity.

In ''Durango,'' the newest production at the Long Wharf Theater's Stage II, Boo-Seng Lee (James Saito), a 56-year-old widower, packs up his pain along with the contents of his desk. He doesn't even tell his sons, who share his Arizona home, the bad news. When Boo-Seng comes home that night, looking forlorn, one boy asks, ''Is he O.K.?'' And the other answers, with teenage apathy, ''Is he ever?'' They sit down to their dinner, bowls of Dinty Moore beef stew, and Boo-Seng announces that it is time for a family trip.

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"INTERNATIONAL 3-14 Iraq's Impact on Terrorism An assessment of terrorism trends by The National Intelligence Estimate has concluded that the American invasion and occupation of Iraq has helped spawn a new generation of Islamic radicals and that the overall terrorist threat has grown since the Sept. 11 attacks. 1 An explosion in the Sadr City district in Baghdad killed at least 35 people, mostly women and children, when a bomb detonated next to a line of women waiting to receive heating fuel from a tanker truck, according to residents and Iraqi officials. 8 Signs of Change in Somalia Islamic leaders in Mogadishu, rather than imposing Taliban-like constraints as expected, seem to be moderating their views, at least officially, and bringing at least the beginnings of order to one of the world's most violent cities. 1 Bolivia's Navy Seeks Open Sea An 1879 loss to Chile in a conflict known as the War of the Pacific cut off Bolivia's access to the coast. Bolivia has a frustrated navy that is confined to patrolling the country's rivers and lakes. Bolivia's president is slowly trying to press for the return of even a sliver of the Pacific coast. 3 Putin Rejects Europe's Fears President Vladimir Putin of Russia dismissed concerns over his country's growing interest in the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company at a meeting in France with his French and German counterparts. 4 British Debate Afghan Conflict The British Army defended itself against charges by officers in Afghanistan that British ground troops had received inadequate air support in their fight against the Taliban. Leaked e-mail messages from officers display a lack of faith in the Royal Air Service but also suggest inaccurate casualty reports. 8 NATIONAL 22-33 Families Rethinking Spinach Beyond the raw statistics of a national outbreak of E. coli linked to fresh spinach are individual stories of a sudden, mysterious, life-threatening illness that struck most often in the homes of those who viewed themselves as more health conscious than many other Americans. 1 Clinton Faults Bush on Terror Former President Bill Clinton, defending his efforts to capture Osama bin Laden, accused the Bush administration in an interview set for broadcast today of doing far less to stop Mr. bin Laden before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 30 NEW YORK/REGION 35-39 Incumbent Changes Tactics Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a moderate Connecticut Republican, has changed tack in her campaign for a 13th consecutive term in Congress, shifting from focusing on domestic issues to criticizing her Democratic opponent, Christopher S. Murphy, as weak on national security. 35 Venezuelan Minister Detained Venezuela's foreign minister was detained at Kennedy International Airport while trying to fly home after the United Nations General Assembly meeting, prompting the State Department to apologize. 37 READERS' GUIDE In its daily news pages, The Times presents both straightforward news coverage and other journalistic forms that provide additional perspective on events.

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The campaigns for Gov. M. Jodi Rell, a Republican, and John DeStefano Jr., her Democratic challenger, said on Monday that they were negotiating to hold at least one debate in October. But they disagreed on whether third-party candidates should participate. Clifford W. Thornton Jr., the Green Party of Connecticut's candidate for governor, and Joseph A. Zdonczyk, the candidate of the Concerned Citizens Party of Connecticut, both qualified to be on the November ballot by getting the required 7,500 signatures on petitions."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Few thirsts run deeper these days than the one for self-improvement, and few recent books have slaked it better than the ubiquitous bumble-bee-colored titles in the ''For Dummies'' series. Since it began in 1991 with ''DOS for Dummies,'' which helped computer neophytes navigate the user-unfriendly program that predated Windows, the series has swelled to more than 1,000 titles and sold more than 150 million copies."

On foliagenetwork.com, updated twice a week, some 550 leaf-spotters from the Northeast, Southeast and Upper Midwest report on color conditions in their area, which are compiled and plotted onto color maps. Meanwhile, those wanting to avoid the crowds should visit travelnotes.org, which has a list of the best fall foliage sites across America, some very much off the beaten track. Why not see the Texas oaks or the Alabama hickories this year?"

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Alan Wolfe, reviewing ''What's Liberal About the Liberal Arts?'' by Michael Bérubé (Sept. 10), says ''Left-wing domination of academia is so obvious a fact that Bérubé never tries to deny it.'' Obvious to whom? To people who wish to believe it? Is it true? Where are the facts? I have taught at numerous colleges and universities for over 30 years and have found that the political spectrum of colleges pretty much mirrored the poltical climate outside the so-callled ivy walls. But I supply a mere anecdote, and I do not attempt to pass it off as fact. It is obvious that the sun ''rises'' and ''sets,'' but that is not exactly true either.

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"MILFOIL, an invasive lake weed, has wrecked many lovely days on the water by wrapping its slimy tendrils around boat engines or swimmers' bodies. That is disturbing to lake lovers, but perhaps not as disturbing as the weed's astonishing vitality: pieces of milfoil that get chopped off simply float away, grow roots and start new plants. ''It's like revenge of the body-snatchers,'' said Larry Marsicano, the executive director of the Candlewood Lake Authority, which has agonized over the weed."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"It's hard to know what to believe about the car of the future. Will we be forced to trade horsepower for solar power? Will wanting to drive a solid, comfortably appointed car that zips along the highway brand you as someone who is blithely hastening the planet's demise? Will we have to drive tiny electric pods that are energy-efficient -- but so cramped on the inside, and in need of recharging so often, that Americans' love affair with the road will become a thing of the past? The blanket answer to all these questions is that things may not be as dire as they seem. The internal-combustion engine isn't headed for extinction anytime soon, but that doesn't mean that some car-company engineers aren't trying to make it greener, creating a turbo engine that promises more power, but with lower fuel consumption and emissions, than its conventional counterpart. And in Silicon Valley, a young company has developed a sleek, high-performance electric sports car that its creators say is more fuel efficient than the hybrids now on the market while boasting acceleration that gives the Porsche a run for its money."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Your item on my book ''The Righteous Men,'' published under the name Sam Bourne (TBR: Inside the List, Sept. 10) and the fate of an unflattering review of it for The Guardian, contained a crucial misrepresentation of the facts. The Guardian's editor did not, as you state, simply ''refuse to run the review.'' Rather he accepted an unprompted offer from the reviewer himself, made when he submitted the piece, to withdraw it for a ''modest kill fee.'' Indeed, the editor told the paper's ombudsman that had the critic ''not volunteered to withdraw the review and accept a kill fee, the paper would have published it.'' Put simply, the idea of not using the review arose only because he, the reviewer, raised it. The ombudsman made all this clear in his article on the matter. Jonathan Freedland London"

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In the year since its opening, Farmer Bar (also known as the Cutchogue Barbecue Company) has built a loyal following of Northerners who have a hankering for real Southern pit barbecue. Pulled pork, smoked brisket and savory Kansas City ribs are served in a former bar that was a farmers' hangout across from the old Cutchogue train station. Renovated by Dan Reyburn and Ron Philipp, who also own Big Mama's Creole Kitchen, a Cajun restaurant in Southold, the roadhouse has been outfitted with dark brown wainscoting, paintings of hogs and roosters, and a sign declaring, ''We're Big on the Pig.''

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LAST month, Gov. George Pataki vetoed a bill that would have prevented mentally ill prisoners from being placed in solitary confinement. More than a decade ago, as a judge, I would have been concerned with the legal implications of the treatment of prisoners diagnosed as mentally ill, but my concern is more personal now. You see, in 1993, I pleaded guilty to harassment, was found to be suffering from bipolar disorder and was sentenced to serve 15 months in a mental health unit of a federal prison. While incarcerated, I was stabbed by another inmate. For my protection I was locked down in what the state calls a ''special housing unit'' -- and what prisoners call ''the box,'' ''the hole,'' or simply ''solitary confinement'' -- which is used to manage the approximately 8,000 mentally ill inmates in the New York prison system."

He was 76 years old and had started the family business in 1959 with his older brothers, Bernard Wadler and Arthur Wadler. A lifelong skier and gardener, Herman Wadler was an outspoken defender of the economic and environmental interests of the Catskills, where he spent his life.

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"It is fair to say that the local reaction to the giant floating natural gas depot that Broadwater Energy has proposed for Long Island Sound has been overwhelmingly negative. The project, a joint venture of Shell and the TransCanada Corporation, has already been charged, tried and convicted of being an industrial menace by a chorus of politicians and environmentalists. This assuredness seems out of place or at least premature, given how much of Broadwater's potential benefits and drawbacks remain in the realm of the arguable and unsettled. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that will decide whether Broadwater gets a license, has not issued a draft environmental impact statement yet, because the government has only just completed its official analysis of the safety and security issues Broadwater raises. The report was to be released on Friday by the Coast Guard, after more than a year of study."

Such attempts to turn the garage into a clean, well-lighted space ignore the reality of suburbia's heart of darkness.

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Jonathan Rauch's discussion of ''The Party of Death,'' by Ramesh Ponnuru (Sept. 3), was most welcome. However, one small point needs to be made. Rauch asks if evena life-threatening (to the mother, we assume)pregnancy could be aborted if abortion were to be considered infanticide. Heclaims that we do not have a ''health exception'' to the murder laws. Yes, we do; it is called self-defense. Arlene Kalley Troy, Mich. To the Editor: As a hard-line abortion rights supporter, I want to clear up a confusion in Rauch's mind between private moral considerations and public law. Abortion rights supporters have never said that a 10-day-old embryo is morally comparable to an appendix, or that pregnancy is comparable to appendicitis.I have argued that the decision to get an abortion should be a private decision by the pregnant woman -- no more regulated by the state than the decision to get an appendectomy. Pregnancy can pose moral, social, economic, emotional or medical problems for a woman that only an abortion can solve. Inserting the government into those considerations is what we abortion supporters want to avoid. If a woman becomes attached to a pregnancy and toher childwhen it is an embryo -- as your reviewer's friend did -- then of course she should carry thepregnancy to term and have the baby. We pro-choice peoplebelieve that the creation of human lifeshould always involve the willing cooperation of the woman in whose body it is going to happen. Adriane Ann Wallace Stamford, Conn"

Garry F. McCarthy, 47, was tapped this month by Mayor Cory A. Booker to become the city's top law-enforcement official. But on Tuesday he was admonished by a judge in Hackensack, who said Mr. McCarthy, a 25-year veteran of the New York City Police Department, used ''extraordinarily poor judgment'' while arguing a parking ticket."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Jonathan Mahler's article on Mayor Bloomberg was thoughtful (Sept. 10). The mayor is willing to stake out politically unpopular positions and believes that financial issues must be factored into any publicly financed projects. The World Trade Center site is fraught with emotion, and the mayor's positions may be deemed unsentimental, but I don't believe he is insensitive to the public's need to remember 9/11 in an appropriate manner. Since he has no legal authority over the site, it makes sense that he concentrate on the surrounding area. The atmosphere of Lower Manhattan before 9/11 was anachronistic, and the migration of business uptown made sense. Deputy Mayor Daniel Doctoroff accurately stated the Bloomberg approach: create an opportunity out of a problem. The quality of downtown life has been enhanced by TriBeCa, and now Lower Manhattan can become another hub of New York City life by including office and residential buildings, parks and a waterfront that is a magnet rather than an eyesore.

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I read Michael Kimmelman's loving remembrance with delight (Sept. 10). I had the good fortune to know his father well. I am a registered nurse who worked at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, where I met Dr. Kimmelman, and later worked for him in his office at 10 Downing Street for a few years in the 1960's.At that time, the overwhelming battle was for voter registration in the South for African-Americans, and a number of patients came to the office whom he had met in Mississippi when he went to support integration efforts. I remember meeting Martin Luther King Sr. and Bayard Rustin when they came in together shortly after Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel Prize. There were many well-known Village residents who were patients. Barney Josephson, who owned the Cookery, was a charming man, and I remember our many conversations, mainly about jazz. Dr. Kimmelman was entertained by the fact that my husband was a jazz drummer, and I spent much of my life in the company of jazz musicians. He picked up on that lingo too. We returned to our home city, Rochester, in 1973, so I didn't see Dr. K. again after that, although we spoke occasionally on the phone. I feel that the times I spent in his company were among the most delightful of my life. Patricia Livingston Victor, N.Y. It was a surprise for me to see the picture of my dear comrade and friend David Kimmelman and his son, Michael, in Red Square in 1967. I was a member of that delegation. Dr. Kimmelman was a pre-eminent ophthalmologist and an engaging and warm human being. Because of his politics, he did some brave and humane things, like bringing the most modern surgical techniques to places like Cuba and Vietnam. On our two-week trip, it was clear to everyone in our group that David and Edythe were loving parents and that young Michael adored them. As I see it, Dr. Kimmelman's belief in peace, socialism, economic andsocial justice put him on the right side of history. When it came to parenting, we all should be so lucky to have had a mother and father like the Kimmelmans. Jarvis Tyner Executive Vice Chairman Communist Party USA New York I was a patient of Dr. Kimmelman's from the time I was about 5 years old (and for many years after). What I remember was a very gentle man who used to reassure me that my copious reading was not harmful, that it was O.K. to be an industrious student and thata little girl who wore thick-lensed glasses was cute and likable, in spite of the teasing endured fromclassmates. Each trip to the doctor was an aid in building self-esteem. Ethel L. Murphy Berkeley, Calif."

The choice, roundly second-guessed at the time, suddenly looks terribly smart. In his regular-season debut, Whitner intercepted New England's Tom Brady, and in his first start, he made seven tackles at Miami. Joining him as a starter in the secondary is another rookie, Ko Simpson. Their challenge will be to limit the yards gained after the catch by Laveranues Coles (assuming he plays with a left shin injury he nursed all week), as well as by Jerricho Cotchery and Justin McCareins, above. NICK MANGOLD VERSUS LONDON FLETCHER Twelve seconds into the Bills' season opener at New England, Fletcher, Buffalo's middle linebacker, recovered a fumble by Brady and raced into the end zone. After the first two weeks, he has more touchdowns than running back Willis McGahee and wide receiver Peerless Price combined. While Fletcher was registering four sacks for the Bills last year, Mangold, the Jets' rookie center, was not allowing a single sack as a senior at Ohio State. KAREN CROUSE (NYT)"

This Panamanian musician is literate in Latin American rhythms, and so part of the wave of the recent, more culturally specific and vastly improved Latin jazz scene. But he is also, in a larger sense, defining post-Hancock, post-Jarrett mainstream jazz piano, with his harmonic knowledge and his will to make a piano trio exciting and fluid.

Young children are exhorted to repent their sins, speak in tongues and pray for salvation, and they weep copious tears of ecstasy, inspiration and (it appears) pure hysteria. This is a very particular summer camp, run by Christian youth ministers bent on shaping young leaders of the fundamentalist right; their mandate is to take back America ''for Christ.'' The film is startling and gets to know three very determined young people.

In ''Spite Marriage'' from 1929, Keaton's last silent picture (with sound but no dialogue), he plays a star-struck dry cleaner who falls in love with, then unexpectedly marries, a Broadway diva.

The cast of the Gateway Playhouse's production has an uphill battle winning over its audience.

As Judt observes, some 36.5 million Europeans died between 1939 and 1945 because of the war, and in its aftermath the continent was scarred with violent retribution, purges and outbreaks of civil war. The book offers a country-by-country analysis of how Eastern Europe shed Communism, and it traces the impact of the Marshall Plan and the rise of the European Union. ''Few would have predicted it 60 years before,'' Judt writes, ''but the 21st century might yet belong to Europe.'' In the Book Review Anthony Gottlieb called ''Postwar'' a ''rich and immensely detailed book.''"

The owners of Zest, Pietro Scotti (also chef and owner of the local Da Pietro's) and his wife, Janine, have converted the limited space into a casual restaurant that serves food almost all day long. The color motif is green: avocado walls with a flowery mural on two of them and pleasing touches like mirrors, a glass vase here and there and a handsome barrel-vaulted ceiling with pine louvers that channel the excellent overhead lighting. The space is L-shaped. I like the more private area in the rear called the Vault Room, though it isn't really a separate room; it uses the old bank vault as part of the décor."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: John Yoo, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Bush administration, acknowledges that President Bush's unique approach to the law, which the president has insisted is necessary to fight terrorism, is motivated by the ''broader'' goal of strengthening executive power (Op-Ed, Sept. 17). Mr. Yoo cites this goal as a reason the administration has fought a ''pre-emptive'' war, ''data-mined communications in the United States to root out terrorism,'' detained terrorists without ''formal'' charges and conducted ''harsh'' interrogations."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Dance performances would be free, in the best of all possible worlds, with all artists earning living wages. The FALL FOR DANCE FESTIVAL, which opens on Thursday at City Center, can't provide that, for all the ingenuity of its conception. But the festival offers an extraordinary range of dance in six programs, featuring 30 companies from around the world and the United States, at $10 a pop. Why see ''The Covenant,'' when the likes of Trisha Brown's signature ''Set and Reset,'' Paul Taylor's fast-moving ''Syzygy,'' traditional Korean dance by the Yi-Jo Lim Sum Dance Company are on offer this week, along with performances by the Dutch National Ballet, the Pennsylvania Ballet, the French hip-hop troupe Compagnie Franck II Louise and others. Through Oct. 8, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan (212) 581-1212 or nycitycenter.org. Katherine Dunham, larger than life even after her death in May, will be celebrated on Saturday in ''A SALUTE TO THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE OF MISS KATHERINE DUNHAM.'' There will be performances by companies including Ms. Dunham's Children's Dance Workshop, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Dance Theater of Harlem and Philadanco. The tight-knit family of vivid original Dunham dancers will be on hand, in an afternoon of reminiscences about an artist who was truly a great lady. At 2 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, Upper West Side, symphonyspace.org; free The Chocolate Factory in Queens is presenting yet another wonderfully nutty-sounding dance and performance event this week. The piece, ''LOVE CERVERE,'' is a collaboration between two veterans of the downtown scene: the dancer-choreographer Elizabeth Ward and Heather Vergotis, a saxophonist and experimentalist composer. Performed Thursday through Saturday, ''Love Cervere'' was inspired by a pantherlike medieval mythological creature known for the sweet smell of its breath, here an inhabitant of the factory's tomblike basement. 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $15."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Pennant Race Glance After today's games, a look at the remaining schedules for the teams with realistic chances for a playoff spot: Holding at Second Nick Johnson of the Nationals has hit the most doubles this season, 46, without a triple. Since 1900, two players have hit more than 50 doubles without a triple: Craig Biggio, 56 with the 1999 Astros; and Edgar Martinez, 52 with the 1995 Mariners. Clout in Colorado The Rockies have three players in the National League top 10 in batting average: Matt Holliday (.332), Garrett Atkins (.324) and Todd Helton (.305). Since its inaugural season in 1993, Colorado has had five batting champions: Andres Galarraga in 1993; Larry Walker in 1998, 1999 and 2001; and Helton in 2000. Pittsburgh Workhorses Salomón Torres,above, of the Pirates leads the majors in appearances this season with 90 and is closing in on the club record, 94, set by Kent Tekulve in 1979. Torres's teammate Matt Capps leads all rookies in appearances with 80 and is the seventh rookie to appear in at least 80 games since 1900. THE WATCH LIST The last week of the season will serve as extended spring training for a number of playoff-bound players coming off the disabled list. Tigers second baseman Plácido Polanco, right, was scheduled to return yesterday after being out since Aug. 15 with a separated shoulder. He should have four or five starts to find his swing and is an upgrade over Neifi Pérez at the plate. Rich Harden is scheduled to make his second start since June 4 on Tuesday after allowing one run and striking out seven in three innings last week. Harden, who was out with a sprained elbow, will be limited to 75 pitches. Depending on how he does this week, he could be a dangerous addition to Oakland's postseason rotation. Playoff positions have been clinched, but there are plenty of things left to watch in New York this week, including Pedro Martínez's calf, Jason Giambi's wrist, Mariano Rivera's right arm and Gary Sheffield's rushed transition to first base."

The grounds of Lyndhurst, the 19th-century Gothic Revival estate in Tarrytown, were dotted with blue and white striped tents and a few yellow ones. It could have been a bustling county fair or a particularly ambitious farmers' market, had it not been for the unusual number of well-groomed collies, beagles, Afghan hounds and their diverse cousins in attendance. The 89th Westchester Kennel Club All-Breed Dog Show, on Sept. 10, was under way. The vizslas were strutting in one of the competition's 15 outdoor rings.

What draws them all is the epic saga of John Basilone, a Marine sergeant who received the Medal of Honor for holding off the Japanese on a critical night during the Battle of Guadalcanal at the war's beginning, and then returned to combat and was killed on Iwo Jima at its end."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"South Boston's dingy waterfront, known mainly for its convention center, is readying for this fall's most hotly anticipated new building: the 65,000-square-foot Institute of Contemporary Art (100 Northern Avenue; www.icaboston.org), designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro. The first new art museum in the city in almost 100 years, it will feature a glass-walled top floor that swoops out above the water, a digital-media room suspended from a gallery for horizonless views and nary a support beam in sight. Add a Wolfgang Puck cafe and a theater, and it's no wonder city planners believe the ICA can help revitalize the district. Two other recent additions: the Westin Boston Waterfront hotel (425 Summer Street; 800-937-8461; www.westin.com; doubles from $359) and L.T.K.

I would like to mention another aspect of the city that impressed me. Statue Park reminds visitors of the culture's horrible Russian past. In this park are approximately 40 Soviet statues.

A group of local artists installed 35 sculptures and other works of site-specific art in August, and the cows have gotten involved -- knocking things over, moving sculptures around, taking the occasional bite. ''In our prospectus to the artists, we made it clear that the pieces had to be cow friendly -- no cables, no pointy edges, no holes,'' said A.

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Two close artistic partnerships go head to head -- to head to head -- this week. ERIC BOGOSIAN'S ''SUBURBIA,'' directed by his wife, JO BONNEY, opens off Broadway at the Second Stage Theater on Thursday, the same night that the ventriloquist JAY JOHNSON comes to Broadway with his longtime professional partner, a wisecracking wooden guy named BOB. Ms. Bonney has directed many of Mr. Bogosian's monologues. But she has also proved to be an assured shaper of nifty ensemble work, notably the recent revival of Lanford Wilson's ''Fifth of July.'' ''SubUrbia,'' for those who missed the original production in 1994 and the Richard Linklater movie, focuses on nine disaffected youths hanging out outside a convenience store on a restless, aimless night. Mr. Bogosian has updated the text for the new production, setting it in the present. So the disgruntled youngsters no longer have to drop dimes in the pay phone to place a call. The promising cast includes KIERAN CULKIN, GABY HOFFMAN (of Wendy Wasserstein's ''Third'') and PETER SCANAVINO (''Shining City''). ''SubUrbia'' kicks off what could be construed as a comeback season for Mr. Bogosian. It will be followed this winter by a revival of ''Talk Radio'' on Broadway, starring Liev Schreiber. Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Meanwhile a mere block away, at the Helen Hayes Theater, Mr. Johnson shares the stage with a former block of wood whittled into the smiling form of Bob, in ''Jay Johnson: The Two and Only.'' Mr. Johnson and his collaborator rose to fame in the 1970's sitcom ''Soap,'' and the aesthetic partnership has now lasted rather longer than the average American marriage. The show combines aspects of a club act with autobiography and a sort-of standup dissertation on the art of ventriloquism. It had a successful run off Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company in 2004. 240 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"As if there aren't enough breathtaking Picassos on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's exhibition ''Cézanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde,'' along comes ''PICASSO AND AMERICAN ART,'' opening Thursday at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Ten years in the making, the show will examine this artist's effect on the course of 20th-century American art. It promises to be big, with about 165 paintings and drawings, nearly 40 of them Picassos, as well as a small number of prints, sculptures and photographs. Much of the focus will be on nine American artists who have been particularly influenced by Picasso and whose work has, in turn, had an impact on the next generation of artists in this country: Stuart Davis, Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, John Graham, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Jackson Pollock, David Smith and Max Weber. The show, on view through Jan. 28, will also include other important contemporary figures in American art, from Warhol and Man Ray to Claes Oldenburg and Marsden Hartley. But if you don't have the strength to tackle this blockbuster, several smaller exhibitions are opening this week too. One is ''SET IN STONE: THE FACE IN MEDIEVAL SCULPTURE,'' which is running Tuesday through Feb. 19 at the Met and consists of 80 sculptures, half from the museum's permanent collection and half loans from the United States and Europe. The sculptures date from the third century through the early 1500's and are made from materials like marble, limestone, polychromed wood and silver gilt. It will be organized to explore different thematic issues like the evolving notion of the portrait in sculpture. Also opening Tuesday at the Met and on view through Jan. 15 is SEAN SCULLY's first solo show in New York. Based on his ''Wall of Light'' series, it includes 60 works inspired by his travels in Mexico. The series -- paintings, watercolors, pastels and acquatints -- was begun in 1998 and explores patterns of light and shadows on the stacked stones of ancient walls and of Mayan stone."

It has power gates, a mahogany interior and a marble floor with wood inlays. Total cost: about $55,000."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"VANDER ELS--Estella (nee Smith), died peacefully on Friday, September 22, 2006, at her home in Wyckoff, NJ. Estella, a descendent of the original Dutch settlers of Bergen County, was born in Waldwick, NJ, and lived there until moving to Wyckoff, NJ, in 1961. A 1931 graduate of Douglass College in New Jersey, she received her Masters Degree from New York University. Estella taught English at the Ramsey High School for many years. She was a former member and president of the Ridgewood League of Women Voters and a former member of The Ridgewood College Club. Estella was a member of the Wyckoff Reformed Church. Estella was pre-deceased by her husband Nicholas in 1986, with whom she was blessed with the opportunity to travel the world on many of the great ships, including the Queen Mary, the QE I and the QE II. Receiving of friends will be Tuesday, 10 until 11 AM, followed by the funeral service at 11 AM, at the Vander Plaat Funeral Home, 257 Godwin Avenue, Wyckoff, NJ. Interment will follow at the Valleau Cemetery in Ridgewood, NJ. www.vanderplaatfuneral home.com."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The growing crop of super-long-haul flights -- Chicago to Shanghai on American Airlines began this spring; New York J.F.K. to Mumbai on Delta starts soon -- is a convenience with a caveat: 14-plus hours in the air can wreak havoc on your body, and new carry-on regulations prohibiting water, lotions and toothpaste make staying shipshape more difficult than ever. The best defense? A well-stocked travel tote. Elizabeth Schatz Passarella"
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Who really cares that CALISTA FLOCKHART is coming back to prime time, four years after her loved-and-hated character Ally McBeal wore her last miniskirt in court? ABC's ''BROTHERS AND SISTERS,'' which has its premiere on Sunday at 10 p.m., has all sorts of movie- and television-star power, including SALLY FIELD, TOM SKERRITT and RACHEL GRIFFITHS (late, so to speak, of ''Six Feet Under''). It is much more exciting that JON ROBIN BAITZ, the wildly talented Off Broadway playwright, is a creator, along with KEN OLIN. This could mean some blend of ''The Substance of Fire'' and ''Thirtysomething.'' It's about an extended California family with its own business, struggles and political differences. Oh, and its series premiere follows the season premiere of ''Desperate Housewives.'' Sydney Pollack has never made a documentary before, so he didn't know any better than to make ''SKETCHES OF FRANK GEHRY'' filmic (Wednesday night on PBS, check local listings). ''Sketches,'' part of the ''American Masters'' series (it also had a theatrical release last spring), takes a close look at the work and working style of Mr. Gehry, the risk-taking Pritzker Prize-winning architect. At one point he looks at a desktop model and announces, ''That is so stupid looking that it's great.'' You can wait until the Sofia Coppola movie opens next month, with Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette. (The idea of Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI is almost irresistible.) Or you can opt for the portraits and dramatizations of documentary reality in David Grubin's ''MARIE ANTOINETTE'' on Monday night (PBS, check local listings). Much of the first hour is devoted to Louis XVI's severe sexual problems, discussed in almost shockingly graphic detail. But 10 minutes or so into the second hour French citizens are storming the Bastille, and the queen's story turns to more public politics."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"WHEN the Bedford Community Church started about 25 years ago, it was attended by a mere 13 or 14 people. Today, the evangelical church has an average attendance of 260 to 285 adults every Sunday, said the Rev. Dwight Ford, its pastor. Because the church holds only about 230 people, there are two services."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In this historic backwater, where the meandering Rondout Creek meets the mighty Hudson, Essel Hoenshell-Watson runs a tiny shop called the Alternative Baker. Kingston's claim to fame is that in 1777 it became the first capital of New York State and was subsequently burned to the ground by the British; Mr. Hoenshell-Watson's claim to fame is the delectability of his lemon velvet cakes. Made from a 1930's recipe, the cakes live up to their name; their velvety interiors are deeply perfumed with lemon and protected by a sugary coat of armor. Baked in fluted molds, they have the look of small, beautifully formed sandcastles."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"A snarky caption contest probably was not what Buick had in mind last week when it sent around a photograph of its celebrity spokesman, Tiger Woods, with a new crossover vehicle called the Enclave. The picture, at right, was meant as a teaser for Mr. Woods's appearance with General Motors' chief executive, Rick Wagoner, in November at the Los Angeles auto show. But the writers at Jalopnik.com, a Web site that regularly mocks the car companies, could not resist spicing things up a little. They asked readers to submit their own ideas, then put them to a vote."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Representatives Jim Ramstad and Patrick J. Kennedy describe intervening moments that led them to seek treatment for alcohol and drug addiction (''Democrat, Republican and a Bond of Addiction,'' front page, Sept. 19). For Mr. Ramstad, it was going to jail; for Mr. Kennedy, a well-publicized car accident. It is important to note that family and friends can also instigate life-altering change. In creating an advertising campaign designed to motivate people to intervene on behalf of a loved one, or spur those in the throes of addiction to seek treatment for themselves, we confronted the barrier attitudes that prevent millions of Americans from getting the help they need. ''They won't listen if I talk to them about their problem'' and ''Treatment doesn't work'' are common sentiments."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"IT had to be white, or at the very least, off-white. The sofa that my mother knew would be her last on this earth could not be dark or murky or even neutral. It would be a bold statement that at last, at very long last, she would own a wildly impractical piece of furniture."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"THE last thing he remembers is this: it was a hot day, and he was in a Hoboken nightclub hanging fliers to promote a gig by his band Amandla. He looked out a window and saw a parking-meter reader heading for his car. To avoid a ticket, he scrambled out the door, ready to call it a day. The next morning he would be heading out on a cross-country tour with his other, better-known band, Ween. When Claude Coleman Jr. woke up four days later, he was in a Newark hospital's critical-care unit with partial paralysis, a pelvis fractured in six places and brain damage. A truck had struck his car on I-78 West, sending it careening across the median and through several lanes of traffic; his wife and parents were unable to locate him for two days."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The celebrations of the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth have not quite ended, and a late installment that begins this week may prove particularly interesting. VLADIMIR FELTSMAN, who redefined himself as a Classicist after being promoted at first as a Russian firebrand, is looking beyond the palette of the modern piano and exploring Mozart's piano sonatas on a reconstruction of a Mozart-era Walter fortepiano. Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Tishman Auditorium of the New School, 66 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village; Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Mannes College of Music, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan; also Oct. 3 and 10 at Mannes, and Oct. 12 at Tishman; (212) 229-5488, newschool.edu/feltsman; $25, $10 for students and 65+, $100 for all five concerts. A highlight of this summer's Mostly Mozart Festival was the streamlined, semistaged period instrument performance of Mozart's ''Idomeneo,'' led by William Christie. Mozart operas are at their best when the scale is intimate, but the grand opera approach survives as well. For listeners who like these works sounding big and beefy, the Metropolitan Opera revives its ''IDOMENEO'' on Thursday. The cast includes DOROTHEA RÖSCHMANN, OLGA MAKARINA and BEN HEPPNER, with JAMES LEVINE conducting. 7:30 p.m., (212) 362-6000; $15 to $375. Though it has received less attention than the Mozart anniversary, the Shostakovich centenary is this year as well. His 13th Symphony, with its moving text by Yevgeny Yevtushenko, commemorated the 1941 massacre at Babi Yar, and its first movement is the centerpiece of ''BABI YAR REMEMBERED: YEVTUSHENKO AND SHOSTAKOVICH IN WORD AND SONG'' at the Museum of Jewish Heritage. (It will be played in the composer's two-piano version by Mischa and Cipa Dichter and the bass Valentin Peytchinov.)

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"WHEN they renovated their 1735 three-level home in Upper Saddle River, N.J., last year, Robert and Mary Wortmann thought of everything: a home theater, a billiards room, a wine cellar and, the ultimate modern convenience, an elevator. It has power gates, a mahogany interior and a marble floor with wood inlays. Total cost: about $55,000."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"You won't find a knockoff of this watch on the corner. Sjoo Sandstrom of Sweden has just introduced its unisex Chronolink Worldtimer to the United States. The Chronolink, combining Swedish design with Swiss mechanical movement, has the straightforward good looks of a classic. Made of stainless steel and titanium, the watch has an analog face, which shows the local time. If you flip it up, a digital display shows the hour in a choice of 25 cities. Handmade by a team of four, the Chronolink has a leather strap in brilliant green, orange, blue or plain brown and a matching or contrasting dial. Then there's the fairest, most Nordic Chronolink of all, the Swedish Blonde Chronometer -- pale strap, white dial -- produced in a limited edition of 100 a year. (About $6,900, exclusively at Clearly First, 980 Madison Avenue; 212-988-8242.) SUSAN GUERRERO"
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"WHEN the Bedford Community Church started about 25 years ago, it was attended by a mere 13 or 14 people. Today, the evangelical church has an average attendance of 260 to 285 adults every Sunday, said the Rev. Dwight Ford, its pastor. Because the church holds only about 230 people, there are two services."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"PACHMAN--Emanuel: (''Manny'') died Wednesday September 6th, 2006 in Brooklyn N.Y. after a battle with cancer. Mr. Pachman was born in Brooklyn on October 1st, 1929. He attended Erasmus Hall High School and graduated from New York University in 1950. He spent 35 years as a CPA and founding partner of Wiss and Company in Livingston N.J., subsequently he was VP of Clement & Muller, a beverage distribution firm in Philadelphia, P.A. He was as dedicated and loyal to those he worked with as he was to his family. Manny worked tirelessly in support of many causes, most notably the state of Israel through his work with the United Jewish Federation of Central N.J. Manny was preceded in death by his wives, Margaret Patterson Pachman (1986), and Marcia Zamoiski Pachman (2004). He is survived by his sons Jeff and Greg, stepsons Joseph and Jason Zamoiski, and grandchildren Jessica and Hunter Pachman and Jordan Zamoiski.

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Though I never met Susan Sontag, I have read nearly everything she wrote (Sept. 10). Sontag spoke of the dialectical exchange between self-revelation and self-concealment, and sheleaned toward the latter. She seemed never to reveal too much of herself in her work. Her novels had a bold yet cold intelligence about them. She allowed more pathos in her essays than in her fiction. This made her essays, for me at least, more pleasurable. I always hoped she would allow herself to write a more moving novel. I felt like a voyeur reading these journal entries. Still, I find these words irresistible. They reveal a vulnerability that we never saw in her fiction or her essays. They are so spontaneous, so raw, so uncalculated -- in other words, they are so unlike the published writing she let the world see. M. Reese Senn San Luis Obispo, Calif."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Robert King's new play ''The Best Man'' is set at a church minutes before a wedding is to take place, but neither the bride nor the priest who is to perform the ceremony ever makes an appearance. Patrick, the nervous groom-to-be, describes how Father O'Malley assured him that his future bride, Doreen, would soon be presenting him with the greatest of gifts -- her virginity. It is hard to believe he is talking about the same notoriously generous young woman we have been hearing about earlier in this funny if generic buddy romp, which is opening the season at the New Jersey Repertory Company."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Though there is ample evidence that a sizable audience still exists for ''Dune,'' Frank Herbert's multivolume saga of the desert planet Arrakis, there seems to be no surefire method for distinguishing these people from the public at large. There are no semiannual gatherings I know of where devoted readers -- Dune-iacs? Duneheads? Herbertologists? -- dress up like the noble Paul Atreides or the wicked Baron Harkonnen. And the once proud cries that the disowned three-hour cut of David Lynch's film adaptation be granted its proper place in the cinematic canon have diminished to a whisper. These days the only reliable mark of a true fan is his e-mail signature, where he can safely inscribe a line or two of the axiomatic wisdom that Herbert dotted across his ''Dune'' novels -- proverbs like ''A process cannot be understood by stopping it,'' or ''The real universe is always one step beyond logic'' -- as a coded electronic wink to his fellow pilgrims driving their caravans across the sands of cyberspace."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: After reading ''Jordan: In Historic Petra, Dazzling Sights for a Small Audience'' (Next Stop, Sept. 6) by Michael Janofsky, I'm seized with the impulse to pack my bags and hop on the next Royal Jordanian Airlines flight to Amman. Had the writer included John William Burgon's immortal couplet from the poem ''Petra,'' ''Match me such marvel save in Eastern clime/ A rose-red city -- half as old as time,'' I think that impulse would have proven irresistible. James V. Dolson Springfield, Va."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"MILFOIL, an invasive lake weed, has wrecked many lovely days on the water by wrapping its slimy tendrils around boat engines or swimmers' bodies. That is disturbing to lake lovers, but perhaps not as disturbing as the weed's astonishing vitality: pieces of milfoil that get chopped off simply float away, grow roots and start new plants. ''It's like revenge of the body-snatchers,'' said Larry Marsicano, the executive director of the Candlewood Lake Authority, which has agonized over the weed."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"NOBODY wants to clean out the garage, although magazines regularly run articles featuring shelving units and stackable bins, pegboards for tools and racks for hanging garden gear. Such attempts to turn the garage into a clean, well-lighted space ignore the reality of suburbia's heart of darkness. Garages are dangerous places, the repository of poisons and sharp implements, accelerants like charcoal lighter and kerosene, gasoline-powered machines of greater or lesser menace. Usually windowless and damp as dungeons, garages speak of toil. Here live the shovels, the rakes, the hoes, the lawn mower."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"LAST month, Gov. George Pataki vetoed a bill that would have prevented mentally ill prisoners from being placed in solitary confinement. More than a decade ago, as a judge, I would have been concerned with the legal implications of the treatment of prisoners diagnosed as mentally ill, but my concern is more personal now. You see, in 1993, I pleaded guilty to harassment, was found to be suffering from bipolar disorder and was sentenced to serve 15 months in a mental health unit of a federal prison. While incarcerated, I was stabbed by another inmate. For my protection I was locked down in what the state calls a ''special housing unit'' -- and what prisoners call ''the box,'' ''the hole,'' or simply ''solitary confinement'' -- which is used to manage the approximately 8,000 mentally ill inmates in the New York prison system."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"SWEDEN The News -- Voters in Sweden rejected the center-left government of Prime Minister Goran Persson in favor of a conservative coalition. Behind the News -- Mr. Persson, prime minister for 10 years, took responsibility for the election loss and said he would resign as the head of the Social Democrats, who have governed, alone or in a coalition, for most of the last 70 years. Political analysts said the defeat reflected a feeling among Swedes that the government was adrift and that the social welfare system had encouraged too many people to stay out of work. IRAQ The News -- American and Iraqi officials are expressing doubts about the ability of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to keep Iraq from sliding into full civil war. Behind the News -- Critics say Mr. Maliki, in office since May, has been unable to build consensus in the country's unity government. He is seen as reluctant to make decisions, in part because of his unwillingness to alienate fundamentalist Shiite leaders and his need to reach out to Sunni groups to end a Sunni-led insurgency. But in public, at least, Bush administration officials say that Mr. Maliki just needs more time. THAILAND The News -- Thailand's prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, was overthrown in a military coup while he was in New York for a United Nations meeting. Behind the News -- Mr. Thaksin had broad support in rural areas and his party won three elections, beginning in 2001. But opposition had grown in Bangkok and other urban areas amid accusations of government corruption and discontent with his efforts to muzzle press criticism. The military, which had staged 18 previous coups since the 1930's, vowed that it would return civilian rule but gave no timetable. HUNGARY The News -- Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany of Hungary came under pressure to resign after he admitted lying about the state of the economy to win election in the spring. Behind the News -- Mr. Gyurcsany's admission led to the worst antigovernmental violence in Hungary since the 1956 uprising, with more than 200 people injured. The prime minister refused to resign and insisted he would push for cuts in public spending, tax increases and new charges for health care and education. Critics noted that he and his party had postponed action on such economic reforms for several years. JAPAN The News -- On the eve of becoming Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe came under fire from critics concerned about his conservative ideology. Behind the News -- Mr. Abe, 52, wants to revise Japan's postwar constitution, which limits the country militarily, and emphasize moral values and tradition in schools. Supporters applaud these moves, which they see as making Japan more independent and a stronger player on the world stage. But critics say Mr. Abe's tinkering risks undermining the values that have made Japan stable -- and wealthy."

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Some 15 years ago, I was a copywriter for an ad agency near the Union Square Cafe (Deborah Solomon, Sept. 10). Occasionally my art director and I would splurge and head there for lunch, just to sit and eat at the bar. Danny Meyer was usually up front greeting the line of waiting patrons. Scruffy and jeans-clad though we were, he treated us like favored guests and as though our business really mattered to him. He was so gracious that to this day, I still have warm feelings for the restaurant. And the food is fabulous. Robin Landis Ridgewood, N.J."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The officials who solemnly sit in judgment as show dogs strut, weave and occasionally fumble in the ring have, for many years, been judged themselves. Each must have at least 10 years' experience as an owner, breeder and exhibitor and must pass a written test on his or her chosen breed and an open-book test on American Kennel Club rules and procedures, as well as sit for an oral interview. Each must also complete a practice round of five judging assignments in the breed. Group judges must be qualified in all breeds in a group, and best-in-show judges must be qualified in at least one of the seven groups and have judged that group at least five times. The process can take years of watching dogs and slowly developing a sure eye."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"When I first began to read comic books, in the mid-1970's, I fell in love with ''The Adventures of Tintin,'' the chronicle by the Belgian artist Hergé of the boy reporter and his dog, Snowy, who get mixed up in exotic, hazardous undertakings; in one episode, Tintin even goes to the moon. For a little boy living in sleepy suburban Australia, Tintin had an exciting, enviable life. Tintin's adventures closely paralleled events of the period in which they were created, including the Cold War and space exploration. In a similar manner, the best work in ''Masters of American Comics,'' on view simultaneously at the Newark Museum and the Jewish Museum in New York, meshes art, entertainment and politics. No doubt thousands of Americans feel the same way about Charlie Brown, Krazy Kat, Popeye, Dick Tracy, Skeezix or Little Nemo as I do about Tintin. These comics grapple with issues like immigration, world wars, racism and the invention of television."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"When beginning any relationship with Ronald O. Perelman, personal or professional, it may be wise to get everything in writing beforehand. Mr. Perelman -- whose divorce from his fourth wife, the actress Ellen Barkin, was final on Valentine's Day -- fired yet another chief executive from Revlon last week and named a new one, the fourth chief in six years. But Jack L. Stahl, the latest ex-C.E.O., lined up a nice severance package before he signed on in 2002. In addition to being obligated to pay him for another three years, at $1.3 million annually, Revlon will forgive a $1.8 million loan it made to him to pay taxes on the one million shares of stock it gave him when he arrived. It will also forgive a $2 million mortgage it gave him when he moved to Manhattan from Atlanta."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Set for Takeoff Wide receiver SANTANA MOSS, above, is undoubtedly unsatisfied with failing to break 70 yards in either of the Redskins' two games. Today, he should return to his 2005 form (84 catches for 1,483 yards). He goes against the Texans, who have the lowest-ranked pass defense in the N.F.L. Glory Days Much has been made of Ravens running back JAMAL LEWIS's success against the Browns leading into their matchup today, but Lewis's troubles against the rest of the league have recently applied to Cleveland as well. Although he has tormented the Dog Pound in the past, the last two seasons have been a different story. All of the attention may provide the bulletin board material the porous Browns defense needs to improve its run defense, ranked 28th in the league. Failure to Launch The former engine of the Colts' offense, Cardinals running back EDGERRIN JAMES has produced below his career norms this season. The poor play of the offensive line has been part of the problem; his per-carry average is down by more than a yard from 2005. The Rams, who have given up 100-yard games to TATUM BELL and FRANK GORE this year, may be an ideal opponent for James to get back on track. Piling On Having repeatedly failed to produce this season, and having been regularly replaced by the rookie VINCE YOUNG, Titans quarterback KERRY COLLINS, above, faces the Dolphins today. He has never thrown a touchdown pass against the Dolphins in 12 seasons, but he has managed to throw eight interceptions."
2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"James Traub describes latter-day Bohemians as being threatened ''not by penury but by gentrification'' (Sept. 10). But there are still plenty of starving artists in New York -- perhaps just not many left downtown. If, as the rest of your issue appears to suggest, being a neo-Bohemian simply means being a hipster, then downtown is certainly still a Bohemian capital. However, far from being threatened by gentrification, these cool kids seem to have plenty of spending money. While I fail to appreciate what is particularly gritty or oppositional about a lifestyle that includes Manhattan rents, limited-edition ''counterculture'' T-shirts and boutiques like the ones you feature, maybe I'm just bitter because I can't afford the new vie bohème.

2006-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Q. I am a month-to-month tenant and have received a 30-day notice of termination. Thirty days is not a lot of time to find a new place and move out. Can I request an extension? How should I go about doing this? And if the request is denied, can my landlord just throw me out without finding me a new place to stay? A. ''The 30-day notice of termination is the first legal step required for a landlord who seeks possession of an apartment,'' said Jamie Heiberger, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer. If a tenant does not move out by the date in the notice, the landlord can then start a court proceeding known as a holdover action to gain possession of the apartment. Ms. Heiberger noted that the letter writer can ask the landlord for an extension either before the expiration of the notice of termination or in the context of the court proceeding."

Between the two films came the martial arts mayhem of Jet Li's ''Fearless'' (Focus/Rogue), with $10.5 million in its debut. Fourth place, according to the box-office tracking company Exhibitor Relations, went to the brave World War I pilots of ''Flyboys'' (MGM), which opened with $6 million. The No. 5 film was the G-rated ''Everyone's Hero'' (Fox), the animated film about a little boy and Babe Ruth's bat, with $4.75 million. Exhibitor Relations reported that ''Jackass: Number Two'' earned back its production budget on its first day out, when it took in more than $11 million. Mel Gibson Dims His Star Keeping a profile so low that it reportedly included a mask and a wig, Mel Gibson, right, attended two screenings of his latest film, ''Apocalypto,'' in Oklahoma last week. The Associated Press reported that Mr. Gibson -- who made headlines in July when he was stopped for speeding in California, acted belligerently and made anti-Semitic comments -- attended screenings at the Riverwind Casino in Goldsby and at Cameron University in Lawton. At the first screening ''Apocalypto,'' an action film in the Yucatec Mayan language, set in that civilization's last days in the 15th century, was shown to an audience consisting mostly of American Indians. At the university Mr. Gibson arrived wearing a mask and wig to avoid being noticed, said Amber McNeil, a university spokeswoman. Earlier in the week she said he had canceled the screenings. ''Apocalypto'' is to be released on Dec. 8. Mourning Colors McCartney Oratorio On the eve of today's release of his fourth classical album, the oratorio ''Ecce Cor Meum'' (''Behold My Heart''), Paul McCartney, below, said work on the piece was halted for a year while he was recovering from the death of his first wife, Linda, who died of breast cancer in 1998, the BBC reported. The couple married in 1969. ''I had to take a year out just to grieve,'' he said, adding that the hiatus was followed ''by a big burst of sad music.'' A work in four movements, ''Ecce Cor Meum'' (EMI Classics), with lyrics in Latin and English, was commissioned by Magdalen College of Oxford University in honor of the college's new music hall. The oratorio is to be performed at Royal Albert Hall in London on Nov. 4. France's Literate Police Victor Hugo? The author of ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' and ''Les Misérables'' was a miserly money grubber. How about the poet Rimbaud? He was ''a monstrosity,'' and his colleague and lover Verlaine ''a worthless human being.'' Where are such judgments to be found? In dust-covered French police files that were unearthed and compiled in a book by Bruno Fuligni, an employee of the French National Assembly, Agence France-Presse reported. The book, ''The Writers' Police,'' says the judgments were collected from 1879 to 1891 from informers and members of the secret police under the supervision of Louis Andrieux, himself the father of a renowned poet and novelist, Louis Aragon. The authorities began watching Rimbaud when he was only 15 and found his behavior repugnant. But, Mr. Fuligni said, ''The police spotted him before the literary inner circle did.'' The files he tapped continue well into the 20th century. Later files are no longer accessible, but Mr. Fuligni wonders if the spying has ended. ''Why,'' he asked, ''would practices so easily carried out in the era of pen and ink suddenly stop in the era of the telephone and the Internet?'' Britain Halts Turner Export The British culture minister, David Lammy, has placed a temporary export ban on ''The Blue Rigi,'' below, the J. M. W. Turner watercolor sold at auction in London in June to an unidentified buyer for nearly $11 million, the BBC reported. The ruling gives British arts institutions two months to express serious interest in buying the painting, depicting the calm of a Swiss sunrise interrupted by sudden movement as a gunshot impels a pair of dogs to leap from a boat toward a group of startled ducks. The buyer has applied for an export license to sell the painting, probably to a customer in the United States. If a British institution shows interest, the export ban will be extended until March to give it time to raise the money to buy it. Mr. Lammy acted on the advice of a review committee that declared ''The Blue Rigi'' to be of ''outstanding aesthetic importance'' and ''outstanding significance for the study of the work of J. M. W. Turner.''"

2006-09-25T00:00:00Z,"New York Dance and Performance Awards, known as Bessies, were given to 24 dancers, choreographers, administrators, visual artists, composers and groups at the Joyce Theater last week. Awards covered both individual work and lifetime achievement. Predictably one of the hippest events of the dance year, this ceremony was unusually low-key and was distinguished by winners' frequent references to family members and their sources of inspiration. Special citations went to Dianne McIntyre, the modern-dance choreographer, teacher and mentor to generations of black female dancers in particular, and to Olga Garay, program director for the arts at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. Choreographer/Creator Awards were given to Wally Cardona, Miguel Gutierrez, Susan Marshall, the collaborators who created Bebe Miller's ''Landing/Place''; Jennifer Monson; Jeremy Wade; Yasuko Yokoshi and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar. Bessies, named after the master teacher Bessie Schoenberg, were given for musical composition to Peter Drungle and Hahn Rowe. The Verdensteatret group won the Bessie for installation and new media for ''Concert for Greenland,'' and Norma Munn, a founder and the current chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, received the Susan E. Kennedy Award in recognition of two decades of arts advocacy. JENNIFER DUNNING"

2006-09-25T00:00:00Z,"Buckeyes' Next Test Ohio State Coach Jim Tressel says he has been impressed with his young defensive unit, but expects to get a fuller measure of its ability next week when the top-ranked Buckeyes travel to No. 13 Iowa. Behind Drew Tate, the Hawkeyes are averaging 380 yards a game. Albert Young, a junior, led the Big Ten Conference in rushing last season. It will be up to Tressel's still-learning defense to preserve the national title hopes of Ohio State. Next for Tech? Tech Saturday's game between No. 11 Virginia Tech (4-0) and No. 24 Georgia Tech (3-1) in Blacksburg, Va., could decide supremacy in the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Georgia Tech's loss came against Notre Dame in the season opener. Virginia Tech was lackluster Saturday in a 29-13 victory against Cincinnati (1-3). Virginia Tech's pass defense, which ranks seventh nationally and is allowing a little more than 131 yards a game, will be tested by wide receiver Calvin Johnson, below. He has 19 catches for 311 yards and 5 touchdowns this season. Line of the Week 0 0 0 0 -- 0 Robert Morris, a Division I-AA team, held Rowan, the No. 3-ranked team in Division III, to minus-19 yards in a 21-0 victory Saturday. That included minus-44 yards rushing, and only one first down, all school records. The senior defensive lineman Ray Gensler had four and a half sacks for the Colonials (2-2). Passing to a Record East Stroudsburg's senior quarterback, Jimmy Terwilliger, threw for 389 yards and 4 touchdowns in a 41-34 victory over California (Pa.) on Saturday to set an N.C.A.A. Division II record for career touchdown passes at 123. The previous mark, 121, was set by Marc Eddy of Bentley last season. Fantastic Finishes Notre Dame wasn't the only team providing late-game theatrics Saturday. Daniel Evans, a redshirt sophomore, helped take some pressure off Coach Chuck Amato when he rallied North Carolina State past Boston College, 17-15, with 8.5 seconds to play. At Arkansas, the freshman Mitch Mustain led the Razorbacks in a 24-23 double-overtime upset of Alabama. And at Georgia, the freshman Joe Cox relieved the ineffective Matthew Stafford, also a freshman, to save the Bulldogs from an embarrassing loss to winless Colorado. A Big 12 Surprise Missouri is 4-0 for the first time since 2003. The No. 25 Tigers are one of two undefeated teams in the Big 12 and the only team in the North Division without a loss. The sophomore quarterback Chase Daniel has thrown for 1,020 yards, 9 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Missouri plays host to Colorado (0-4) on Saturday."

2006-09-26T00:00:00Z,"Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, a playwright and a writer for Marvel Comics, has a fondness for including details about New York City in his comic book tales. Such points have varied from the Human Torch, a member of the Fantastic Four, boasting about getting tickets for ''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee'' to having Nightcrawler, an X-Man, investigate demons in the Dakota. In ''Sensational Spider-Man'' No. 30, right, which went on sale on Wednesday, Mr. Aguirre-Sacasa used the Whitney Museum of American Art as the setting for a battle between the wall crawler and Max Dillon, who happens to be a fan of fine art and is also the supervillain Electro. While Dillon is admiring paintings by Mark Rothko, a caption tells the reader, ''Before he was a supervillain, before he was a telephone-wire repairman, Dillon dreamed about being an artist. (The same way a young German man named Adolph once did.)'' Soon enough, however, the art lesson is over and a superpowered fight begins. GEORGE GENE GUSTINES"

The painting, left, from a private collection, is an early copy in vibrant colors believed to reflect those of the Leonardo da Vinci original, CBC Arts reported. The reproduction, to be seen in London for the first time since 1902, is thought to have been traced from the original by an unidentified French artist a century after the masterpiece was painted between 1503 and 1516. Copies were not uncommon in that era, because seeing the originals required long journeys. Although the original, in the Louvre in Paris, has faded over the years, the reproduction shows the Mona Lisa in bright colors -- yellow sleeves, a forest-green gown -- under a dazzling blue sky. Martin Kemp, a professor of art history at Oxford University and a Leonardo specialist, told The Guardian, ''It will give people a real sense that the Mona Lisa was once a colorful painting.'' The copy, once owned by Sir Joshua Reynolds, who got it from the Duke of Leeds in 1790, will be on view from Oct. 10 to Feb. 11.

2006-09-27T00:00:00Z,"With a Song in Her Heart Love, it seems, has found a way. Kate Moss and Pete Doherty, below, are together again. In the latest chapter of their on-again, off-again relationship, Ms. Moss, who normally carries the tag supermodel, accompanied Mr. Doherty, who often carries the tag drug-addicted, to Ireland, where his band, Babyshambles, was touring. What's more, witnesses said Ms. Moss took to the stage and sang beside Mr. Doherty before a crowd of 680 at a nightclub in Carlow, south of Dublin, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Doherty checked himself out of a drug rehabilitation clinic in London last week. Short Story Prize Awarded Haruki Murakami of Japan has won the second Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award, a $44,700 prize billed as the world's richest for short stories, The Guardian of London reported. Mr. Murakami, below, is to share his prize for ''Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman: Twenty-Four Stories'' (Knopf) with his translators, Philip Gabriel and Jay Rubin. When the announcement of the winner was made in Cork, Ireland, the hometown of O'Connor (1903-1966), the jury hailed Mr. Murakami as ''a master of prose fiction,'' saying he ''writes with great integrity, unafraid of dealing with tough and difficult situations between people who constantly misunderstand each other.'' Another Fateful Traffic Stop Just as man occasionally bites dog, so does art sometimes ape life. Take ''In Vino Veritas,'' an episode of NBC's ''Law & Order'' that went before the cameras this week. In it, Chevy Chase guest-stars as a television celebrity who is pulled over by the police for drunk driving while wearing bloody clothes and whose religious prejudice emerges after his arrest.

GAZETA SOLDIER ABUSE TRIAL ENDS -- A Chelyabinsk military court on Tuesday sentenced the main defendant in the case of a soldier maimed during a hazing incident to four years in prison. Junior Sergeant Aleksandr Sivyakov was also stripped of his rank and will not be able to hold a command position in the Russian military for three years. Both sides in the case plan to file appeals. UKRAINE, RUSSIA CLASH OVER FAMINE -- A request by Ukraines foreign minister that the United Nations recognize the famine of 1932-1933 as genocide against the Ukrainian people has put further strain on the countrys relations with Russia. Moscow labeled the appeal an anti-Russian demarche. Russia voted against a similar initiative in 2003 and is expected to do so again if Ukraines current request comes to a vote before the U.N. General Assembly. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA CONSTRUCTION OF BUSHEHR PLANT BACK ON TRACK -- Russian and Iranian officials signed an agreement on Tuesday to complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran November 2007. Russias participation in the project had been called into question by Irans vice president, who criticized Russian contractors for delays. In addition to work on Bushehr, Russias major nuclear plant construction company is vying with companies from the United States and France for an $8 billion contract to develop Chinas nuclear energy infrastructure. LEADERS LECTURE YOUTH ON AUTHORITY -- The presidential administration and the United Russia Party held the first session of the School of Young Leaders on Tuesday, as part of a project to interest young people in political and business leadership. United Russias leaders, businessmen and leaders of professional unions, addressed about 400 school-aged students in seminars throughout the day. Representatives from opposition political parties were not invited. KOMMERSANT RUSSIAN PEACEKEEPERS MUST GO -- The ministers of foreign affairs of Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova have agreed to create their own police force to replace Russian peacekeepers in post-Soviet conflict zones. At the same time, the pro-West quartet is lobbying the United Nations to adopt anti-Russian resolutions on conflicts in the region. According to the newspaper, these initiatives come in response to fears that Russia will soon recognize separatist republics in their territories, particularly in Georgia and Moldova. NO TO REFERENDUM ON PUTINS THIRD TERM -- Russian citizens do not have the right to hold a referendum on a third presidential term for Vladimir Putin, the Central Elections Commission said on Tuesday. A civic organization in North Ossetia proposed such a referendum in September. By law, the State Duma, Federation Council and regional parliaments would have to approve a constitutional amendment changing the limit, which is now two terms of four years each. VEDOMOSTI RUSSIA SCORES LOW FOR COMPETITIVENESS -- Because of its lack of intellectual property protections and shoddy courts, Russia placed 62nd out of 115 countries in a World Economic Forum evaluation of countries competitiveness. The forum rated Russia the worst for the quality of its institutions. Russia scored well for its low level of state debt and its effective labor market. Russian and foreign investors, along with several economic experts, have expressed concern over what they see as systemic failures and bad government policies hurting Russias economic competitiveness. NOVYE IZVESTIA MOSCOWS TRASH PROBLEM -- According to Greenpeace, the level of garbage in Moscow has recently risen by between 5 and 9 percent, leading to the creation of unsanctioned garbage dumps, 158 of which were recorded in 2005. In a hearing last week on the citys garbage problem, Moscow Duma deputies blamed, above all, private garbage truck drivers who violate waste regulations. According to environmentalists, however, the main problem is a lack of modern technology for disposing of and recycling waste. ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA RUSSIAN PEACEKEEPERS READY FOR LEBANON -- The upper house of Russias parliament sanctioned on Tuesday the dispatch of Russian military engineers to Lebanon for peacekeeping missions. Russia rarely sends its troops abroad: the country sent an airborne unit a few years ago to Sierra Leone as part of a United Nations peacekeeping mission. The first battalion of Russian troops headed for the Middle East is expected to leave next Tuesday."

The dog regulations, which fall under the jurisdiction of health officials, would be turned over to the Department of Parks and Recreation, which for 20 years has relaxed the city's leash law at night and in the morning. But a civic group in Queens has filed suit against the city, claiming that unleashed dogs are a threat to people and other animals, and that parks officials must abide by the letter of the city's current regulations, which require dogs to be leashed at all times.

But they said that such measures alone would fail to deal with the illegal residence in this country of about 11 million immigrants as well as labor shortages in particular industries. The senators called for an approach similar to the Senate bill, which would tighten border security, toughen penalties for employers who hire illegal immigrants, put most illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship and create a guest-worker plan to address labor shortages. They acknowledged that passage of such legislation was unlikely before the elections. RACHEL L. SWARNS (NYT)"

2006-09-27T00:00:00Z,"Turtle Beats Hare Eagles defensive tackle Mike Patterson, above, lumbered 98 yards to score on a fumble recovery in Philadelphia's victory Sunday over San Francisco. While chasing Patterson on the play, San Francisco tight end Vernon Davis broke his leg. Davis, a rookie whose five-year, $23 million contract makes him the highest-paid tight end in the league, is out for four to six weeks. A broken leg is probably the only thing that could have prevented Davis from catching Patterson. Davis ran his 40-yard dash at the scouting combine in 4.38 seconds, the fastest time ever by a tight end. Patterson, a first-round pick last year out of Southern California, was clocked in 4.83. To add injury to injury, the 49ers' Frank Gore was also hurt on the play. Gore, the 49ers' leader in rushing yards and receptions, sustained bruised ribs when Brian Dawkins's helmet rammed into his midsection and knocked out the ball. Trouble in Texas Again Houston tried to address its deficiencies on defense when it made defensive end Mario Williams the No. 1 pick in this year's draft, but Williams has eight tackles in his first three games and has yet to record a sack."

As usual, the 10 p.m. hour belonged to NBC's ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,'' with Christopher Meloni, which drew 14.3 million viewers, besting Week 2 of ABC's ''Boston Legal'' (10 million) and CBS's ''Smith'' (9.6 million). On the CW, the seventh season premiere of ''Gilmore Girls'' at 8 earned 4.6 million viewers, down 35 percent from its debut last year. BENJAMIN TOFF"

Eleven were All-Stars from the Staten Island team that played in the Little League World Series last month. Eight were Yankees, all current or former All-Stars. The exception was Chien-Ming Wang, the starting pitcher, who finished his first full major league season with a 16-5 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. Wang has never made the All-Star team, but the Yankees are counting on him heavily."

2006-09-28T00:00:00Z,"Last month, architecture students at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, led by their professor, Nader Tehrani, top right, installed a transparent, undulating, sometimes gleaming, sometimes misty polycarbonate structure, top, outside the school's architecture building. The $70,000 installation was the result of a year's research by the students on transforming flat polycarbonate into three-dimensional structures. ''It's a sheet material, but because of its pliability, it has the ability to bend and twist,'' said Mr. Tehrani, a partner at Office dA, a design firm in Boston. He and the students started with a seat, he said, and ''grew the structure out of that.'' At its base, top left, the piece, which is held together by small rivets, looks like stacked horizontal ribbons and functions as a bench. As it rises, right, the ribbons twist into a series of four-sided openings before coming together to rest on top of an existing concrete beam that helps frame the entrance to the building. ''It rotates out and creates this bubbly effect, almost like it fizzles open,'' Mr. Tehrani said."

Not all parents want a young child to go directly into a twin-size bed, which can seem vast compared with a crib, as well as uncomfortably high off the floor. Smaller bed frames, many of which accommodate a standard crib-size mattress (28 by 52 inches), can make the transition easier. And the styles go from sleek and modern to whimsical, to suit every taste. (None described here come with mattresses.) 1. The platform of Amar, a toddler bed that holds a crib-size mattress, is 42 by 58 inches. It comes in walnut and has removable side rails; $1,875 from moderntots.com or (877) 289-0453. 2. The Hensvik bed frame, with a side rail, looks like a little daybed. It takes a mattress 27 1/2 by 63 inches, larger than a crib size but smaller than a twin; $89.99 at Ikea, ikea.com (800-434-4532 for store addresses). 3. The Oeuf Toddler Bed by Sophie Demenge and Michael Ryan, designers in Brooklyn, is 54 by 30 inches and sits six inches off the floor. It comes in white with a birch platform, or in white with walnut. The bed takes a crib-size mattress and costs $516 in birch and $536 in walnut; babygeared.com or (888) 868-8139. 4. Petra is a toddler bed by Jenny Argie and Andrew Thornton, another Brooklyn design team. It has detachable side rails and comes in five finishes: white, birch, red maple, walnut and cherry. The eight-inch-high platform is 60 by 36 inches and holds a crib mattress; $395 from argington.com or (800) 482-0522. 5. The Red Race Car Toddler Bed is 53 by 29 inches and holds a crib mattress. The shape of the bed -- as unusual as it is familiar -- is intended to appeal to young car enthusiasts; $199.99 from toddlerbeds.com or (800) 608-9695. 6. Mammut is a junior bed that takes a mattress 63 by 27 1/2 inches (larger than a crib mattress, but smaller than a twin).

Far from the social crowd on the green, players can concentrate on the essentials: consistency of their shots and tweaking their tempo so their down swing is much faster than their backswing. The setup is simple. Users strike an actual ball (ideally into a net) while watching a course on screen. For those who prefer to spend time on the links while improving their game, golf watches make it possible to track statistics, if a player is willing to patiently enter them after each shot. Some even include heart rate monitors to alert a stressed player when his or her heart rate spikes. Others have internal sensors that can compare the ratio of backswing to downswing."

In Tennessee, another Southern state long considered safely red, Representative Harold E. Ford Jr., a Democrat, has run a strong campaign that has kept that state in contention."

Mr. Aiken's new entry, ''A Thousand Different Ways'' (RCA), stood at No. 2, with 205,000 sold, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Another newcomer, ''The Dutchess'' (will.i.am/A&M), the solo debut album from the Black Eyed Peas vocalist Fergie, finished third with 142,000 sold. Kenny Chesney's ''Live: Those Songs Again'' (BNA) took fourth place on the 200 chart with 137,000 copies sold, enough for first place on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. John Mayer's ''Continuum'' (Aware/Columbia) dropped to fifth place from second, with 133,000 in sales, and in its third week in release Beyoncé's ''B'Day'' (Columbia) slipped to sixth place from third, with 91,000 sales. Turmoil at Auction Of Paintings by Hitler Protesters disrupted bidding on watercolors attributed to Hitler at an auction on Tuesday in Lostwithiel, a town in Cornwall, England, the BBC reported. One was Aaron Barschak, left, a self-styled ''comedy terrorist'' who in 2003 wore a pink dress, false beard and Osama bin Laden-style turban, and scaled the walls of Windsor Castle to crash Prince William's 21st birthday party. The other was an unidentified man dressed as Hitler. They were ejected from the auction of 21 works and 2 pencil sketches, which fetched a total of $224,000. Mr. Barschak said he was protesting because he found the sale offensive, and his wife, Tamara, said: ''If it was in London, there would have been protests. Adolf Hitler was a mass murderer, and to make money from that is wrong.'' Some relatives of Holocaust survivors also denounced the auction of the art, found in an old suitcase in an attic in Belgium, near where Hitler served in World War I. Ian Morris, the auctioneer, said: ''These are historical documents, and we can't change history. Maybe it's not so bad to bring this man back to the fore, so the things he did are never forgotten.'' Robert Frost Poem Is Discovered A previously unknown poem by Robert Frost (1874-1963) is to be published on Monday in The Virginia Quarterly Review. Found by a graduate student, Robert Stilling, in a collection of books and manuscripts bought by the University of Virginia, the 35-line poem, ''War Thoughts at Home,'' was written in 1918, not long after Frost's friend and fellow poet Edward Thomas was killed in World War I. It deals with a woman who learns that her husband has died in combat. In the Virginia review it is accompanied by critical essays by Glyn Maxwell, poetry editor of The New Republic, and by Mr. Stilling. Paris Hilton Charged Paris Hilton, below, was charged yesterday with drunken driving after her arrest earlier this month, Reuters reported. Ms. Hilton, 25, faces a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine, but Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for the Los Angeles city attorney, said first-time offenders were often given probation and required to attend alcohol counseling. Ms. Hilton, accused of driving under the influence of alcohol and driving with a blood-alcohol level above the California legal limit of .8 percent, said after her arrest that she had spent the day shooting a music video and had a drink on an empty stomach at a charity party. Crocodile Hunter Had a Premonition Steve Irwin, television's Crocodile Hunter, always believed he would die young, but not that he would be killed by an animal, his widow, Terri Irwin, said in an interview broadcast yesterday, The Associated Press reported. ''I never thought it would be an animal; he never thought it would be an animal,'' Ms. Irwin told the Nine Network in Australia. ''I thought he would fall out of a tree; he thought it would be a car accident.'' Mr. Irwin, 44, died when he was stabbed in the chest by the barb of a stingray on Sept. 4 while filming a television show on the Great Barrier Reef. Ms. Irwin said her husband ''had a very strong conviction'' that he would die early. ''To the point where I'm grateful, in a way, because we're prepared,'' she said."

Pujols may have saved the Cardinals' postseason hopes with what Manager Tony La Russa called his biggest hit of the season. In the eighth inning, with the Cardinals four outs away from their eighth consecutive loss, Pujols pulled a long three-run homer over the Big Mac Land sign into the third deck in left field to beat San Diego, 4-2."

Arrested in 2003, he is the only person to face charges arising out of a sweeping French investigation into the 2001 attacks. According to documents read in court, he was in contact with Ziad al-Jarrah, the hijacker pilot of United Airlines Flight 93, as well as Ramzi bin al-Shibh, one of the men accused of helping plan the attacks. Mr. Mehdi told the court that he met the two men only once, on a visit to Hamburg, Germany, where a cell of Al Qaeda whose members included the hijackers operated. JOHN TAGLIABUE (NYT)"

The pace of casualties has been growing since spring as Canada's 2,300 troops have taken on greater responsibilities in the dangerous Kandahar Province of southern Afghanistan as part of the NATO force in Afghanistan.

2006-09-28T00:00:00Z,"The government decided to raise significantly the pensions of veterans who fought for France as foreigners in World War II, finally paying them the same as their French comrades in arms. The decision coincided with the release of the film ''Indigènes'' (its English title is ''Days of Glory''), which focuses on the discrimination suffered by troops from France's colonies in Africa during the war. President Jacques Chirac ordered the pension adjustment after he saw the film in a private screening. According to his spokesman, Mr. Chirac told his cabinet that the decision was ''an act of justice.'' More than 250,000 troops from France's colonies fought on the side of the Allies. The measure, which will go into effect next year, will affect about 80,000 veterans or widows from more than 20 countries and cost $140 million a year. ELAINE SCIOLINO (NYT)"

2006-09-29T16:29:15Z,"On a recent KLM flight from Amsterdam to Kilimanjaro, I was bumped from business class to economy, despite a confirmed reservation and seat assignment, because of overbooking. The KLM agent said I'd be reimbursed for the difference between the two fares for this leg of the trip. I had paid $4,300 for my round-trip business-class ticket; on the day I booked, the lowest coach fare was $1,300, so I naively assumed KLM would reimburse me half the difference - $1,500. Eight weeks later, Northwest Airlines (a partner of KLM) credited my Visa account with $105, explaining that their calculation of the fare difference for a refund is based on an internal formula, unrelated to the relative price of the fares at the date of purchase. Do I have any recourse? - Robert Munoz, Seattle"

The 5-to-1 decision by the state&#8217;s highest court said the man, Stanley M. Shepp, had a constitutional right to express his beliefs about plural marriages and multiple wives even though bigamy was illegal.

2006-09-29T00:00:00Z,"It doesn't matter if he's performing drama or farce, O'Neill or Kaufman and Hart. Byron Jennings always comes off as the most elegant man onstage. Mr. Jennings, who has the erect posture and dignified bearing of a politician -- he played Tony Blair, the British prime minister, in ''Stuff Happens'' -- doesn't usually walk into a room. He strides. And his line readings have the controlled self-assurance of a man who knows exactly what he's doing. While he isn't exactly a household name, the versatile Mr. Jennings has the kind of face that any regular theatergoer would recognize from countless supporting roles, in recent productions like ''A Touch of the Poet,'' ''Sight Unseen'' and ''Twelve Angry Men.'' Chances are, if you're going to see a revival of an ensemble piece on Broadway, Mr. Jennings is in it. Now he appears in the Roundabout's production of George Bernard Shaw's ''Heartbreak House.'' You will know him not only by his long, deadpan face and his scant lips, but also by his velvety voice and masterly elocution. He makes every line, no matter how mundane, sound like poetry, a trait that should come in handy in ''Heartbreak.'' He plays the handsome Hector Hushabye, above, who seduces women with tales of exploits that have no relation to the truth. It's smart casting; Mr. Jennings can sound so smooth that you will believe just about anything he says. (''Heartbreak House'' is in previews and opens on Oct. 11 at the American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, 212-719-1300.) JASON ZINOMAN"

2006-09-29T00:00:00Z,"Ray Brown was the quintessential jazz bassist, a stalwart timekeeper and harmonic anchor who held things together while moving them forward. He died in his sleep in 2002, just before a scheduled performance, and he has been duly missed: certainly by Oscar Peterson, the pianist who was his closest musical partner, and Diana Krall, whom he discovered in Nanaimo, British Columbia, in 1981. That same year the Blue Note opened in New York, and Brown became one of its most valuable allies, helping to secure engagements with peers like Mr. Peterson, who had gotten out of the habit of playing clubs. Next week, as part of the Blue Note's 25th-anniversary celebration, the club will present a tribute to Brown featuring some of the younger artists who worked with him over the years. Ms. Krall is not scheduled to make an appearance, but the fine singer Dee Dee Bridgewater will be prominently featured. (Incidentally, both Ms. Bridgewater and Ms. Krall can be heard on Brown's Telarc album ''Some of My Best Friends Are Singers.'') Fittingly, the pianist and the drummer on the engagement are Benny Green and Greg Hutchinson, esteemed alumni of the Ray Brown Trio. And the bassist conscripted to fill the hot seat is Christian McBride, above, whose first album for Verve, in 1995, not only featured Brown in a cameo but also addressed him in liner notes as ''Dad.'' It stands to reason that the resulting tribute should exude warmth and good feeling, qualities true to the spirit of its honoree.

The rich land at the bottom of the lake and the surrounding picturesque hillsides, which you note are owned in part by the Army Corps of Engineers, allowed native people to live in self-sufficiency for generations, beginning long before Lewis and Clark were saved from starvation by the three tribes. I am a native North Dakotan who grew up an hour from Lake Sakakawea. Although as a child I fished in the lake and went to a camp on its shores, I have only recently learned its secret and I am embarrassed by it. The scattering of intact, industrious native families is a black cloud over this body of water. Julie Young Portland, Ore."

2006-09-29T00:00:00Z,"When the ''Fall for Dance'' festival tickets went on sale this month, a line began forming at 5:30 a.m. and continued to snake around the block all day. Telephone lines were jammed. Fourteen thousand tickets were sold the first day. There aren't many tickets left for the third annual ''Fall for Dance,'' which began last night. But it's worth joining the cancellation lines to take your chances on whichever five wildly diverse companies are scheduled to perform on any given night this week. City Center, whose president, Arlene Shuler, founded the event, has put together a sophisticated mix of dance genres and aesthetics that places big ballet companies alongside aficionado-only contemporary-dance troupes, and modern-dance stalwarts (like the Parsons Dance Company, right) next to flamboyant flamenco or hip-hop performers. As in the last two years, there are six programs featuring 30 companies. Last night's opening program will be repeated tonight, so it is still possible for devotees to see them all. This year City Center has extended the run so that some programs will be presented twice. Seasoned dance-lovers may particularly enjoy seeing much-talked-about companies like the Ballet Boyz and Random Dance from London; Dutch National Ballet; and Compagnie La Baraka/Abou Lagraa from France. But the best thing about ''Fall for Dance'' is the continual possibility of serendipitous discoveries, and the reminder of how big a world dance can be.

Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. Broadway 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'esoterica' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman) 'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'JOHN FERGUSON' This 1919 tragedy about a poor Irish family and how far its members will go not to lose their farm is a compelling, fully realized drama with a cast that doesn't miss a beat (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Gates) 'LEMKIN'S HOUSE' The man who invented the word genocide, Raphael Lemkin, turns out to have an unsettled afterlife in this compelling drama by Catherine Filloux. He learns, through visitations by Tutsis and others, that the international law he campaigned for against genocide may not have accomplished anything. John Daggett is impressive as Lemkin (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE PAIN AND THE ITCH' A sharp-elbowed new comedy by Bruce Norris about the indiscreet hypocrisies of the urban liberal bourgeoisie. Some familiar dysfunctions and some more exotic ones disrupt Thanksgiving dinner. Funny but tough to stomach (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) * 'SEVEN GUITARS' Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) 'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SISTERS' Declan Hassett's dark tale of sibling rivalry set in rural Ireland occasions the welcome return to the New York stage of Anna Manahan, the Irish actress who won a Tony in 1998 playing the ferociously needy mother in Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' A bit less welcome is Mr. Hassett's relentlessly downbeat play itself (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'SONGS OF THE DRAGONS FLYING TO HEAVEN' Young Jean Lee has fashioned a hysterically funny piece of theater with twisted socio-political power and giggly Korean dancers who would fit right into a Quentin Tarantino movie (1:30). HERE Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00). Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates) 'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood) 'wasps in bed' This Berkshires-to-bedroom farce would make a clever sitcom, if only the authors would face the fact that it isn't really about sex (1:45). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims for a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Anne Midgette) 'ASYLUM: THE STRANGE CASE OF MARY LINCOLN' This musical telling of the real-life tale of the former first lady and how her son had her committed to an asylum in 1875 has some structural problems and could use more exposition by June Bingham, the book writer, but some of Carmel Owen's songs are decent, and the saga has a pull to it (1:45). The Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'I 3/5sheart 4/5 KANT' Ken Urban's nimble, knowing one-act is about four women (a graduate student, a heroin addict, a depressive and a bombing victim), the men in their lives and the little humiliations and unexpected certainties of daily existence (1:10). Linhart Theater at 440 Studios, 440 Lafayette Street, near Astor Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Monday. (Gates) 'intellectuals' Scott C. Sickles's comedy, about a woman who decides to try lesbianism, and how it affects her husband, has lots of great lines, though the director, David Gautschy, and some of the actors aren't up to the pacing challenge. Ellen Dolan of ''As the World Turns'' is appealing in the lead, though (2:05). The Workshop Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 695-4173; closing on Monday. (Genzlinger) 'THE MAN HIMSELF' Ami Dayan stars in his own adaptation of Alan Drury's play about an average man's slide into religious fanaticism. An unsettling tale of everyday alienation and its potentially dangerous consequences (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'nami' Chad Beckim's well-acted but overheated drama is about two dysfunctional couples whose fates intersect tragically (2:00). Kirk Theater, Theater Row Studios, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP-SHOPPING' Reverend Billy (a k a the performance artist Bill Talen) struts and preaches his way across the Spiegeltent stage accompanied by a choir and a fine seven-piece band. Radical political theater has rarely been more thoughtful or fun (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (George Hunka) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ACCEPTED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A clever slacker and his oddball crew invent a phony college in this passable example of that oxymoronic genre, the Hollywood comedy about sticking it to the man. (Nathan Lee) 'ALL THE KING'S MEN' (PG-13, 120 minutes) This second adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's big novel of political and spiritual corruption in Depression-era Louisiana is full of grand themes, good actors (Jude Law, Sean Penn, Kate Winslett, Mark Ruffalo) and lovingly-photographed southern scenery. And yet nothing seems to work. It's a chaotic stew of ambitions and ideas, but in the end neither convincing nor coherent. (A. O. Scott) 'AMERICAN HARDCORE' (R, 98 minutes) This documentary history of the American hardcore punk rock movement that flourished as an underground in the first half of the 1980's is as swift and jagged as the defiant music it remembers with an encyclopedic thoroughness. (Stephen Holden) 'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis) 'THE BLOSSOMING OF MAXIMO OLIVEROS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in Filipino) Nathan Lopez, a newcomer, delights as the flamboyantly gay Maxi, the youngest son in a family of thieves who falls in love with a handsome police officer. (Lee) 'THE COVENANT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) The director Renny Harlin proves that ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' was not the nadir of his career with this thriller about boy witches fending off a nefarious transfer student. (Lee) 'CRANK' (R, 83 minutes) A poisoned hit man rampages in Los Angeles, doling revenge on his nemesis and misanthropy on all. Basically a broken-down retread of ''Speed,'' with Jason Stratham as the bus. (Lee) 'CROSSOVER' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Bling is bad, and friends are good in this story of temptation, rivalry and cheerleaders, set in the world of Detroit street basketball. (Lee) 'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott) 'EVERYONE'S HERO' (G, 88 minutes) Animated in name only, ''Everyone's Hero'' follows a 10-year-old baseball fanatic as he tries to return Babe Ruth's stolen bat. Largely indifferent to its Depression-era setting, the movie is even less concerned with the need for enchantment. But since this is the last creative collaboration of Christopher and Dana Reeve, the movie's sentimental provenance could earn it a critical pass it doesn't deserve. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis) 'FLYBOYS' (PG-13, 129 minutes) Empty-headed and egregiously polite, this nostalgia trip to World War I is what you'd get if Norman Rockwell directed ''Top Gun.'' (Lee) 'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis) 'HOLLYWOODLAND' (R, 126 minutes) A fictional look at the life and downward-spiraling times of George Reeves, the man who played Superman on television and is here played by a fine Ben Affleck. Allen Coulter directs Paul Bernbaum's screenplay, which features a dead-end parallel plot about a detective (Adrien Brody). (Dargis) 'HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS' (PG, 98 minutes) The worms go in, the worms go out, but mostly the worms go into the frying pan in Bob Dolman's engaging and yucky adaptation of the Thomas Rockwell book. (Dargis) 'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis) * 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden) * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott) 'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis) * 'JACKASS: NUMBER TWO' (R, 92 minutes) Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies. (Lee) * 'JESUS CAMP' (PG-13, 85 minutes) This riveting (and alarming) documentary about the training of children to fight in ''God's army'' for the charismatic/evangelical arm of Christian fundamentalism focuses on Kids on Fire, a religious summer camp in Devil's Lake, N.D. (Holden) 'jet li's FEARLESS' (PG-13, 105 minutes, in Mandarin) Jet Li says goodbye (supposedly) to the martial arts genre with this decent blend of old-school chopsocky and new-school superproduction. (Lee) * 'LASSIE' (PG, 100 minutes) Everything old is new again in the 11th film about the beloved pooch with the I.Q. of a grad student and the instincts of a boomerang. Blissfully restored to the period and location of Eric Knight's original novel -- pre-World War Britain -- the movie balances humor and pathos with old-fashioned charm and not a trace of satire. (Catsoulis) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) 'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis) * 'MUTUAL APPRECIATION' (No rating, 110 minutes) Andrew Bujalski's wonderful independent film about friendship in the modern world looks like something that came out of a time capsule, but there's nothing dusty about it. Shot on expressively grainy black-and-white celluloid, it is the sort of unassuming discovery that could suffer from too much big love, and while it won't save or change your life, it may make your heart swell. Its aim is modest and true. (Dargis) * 'OLD JOY' (No rating, 76 minutes) Two old friends drive out of Portland, Ore., one day and into a strained reunion in Kelly Reichardt's ''Old Joy,'' a triumph of modesty and of seriousness that also happens to be one of the finest American films of the year. (Dargis) 'RENAISSANCE' (No rating, 105 minutes) The stark black-and-white look of this futuristic film noir, which blends animation with live action, is far more interesting than its elaborate plot, which is as impenetrable as that of ''The Big Sleep.'' (Holden) * 'THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP' (R, 106 minutes, in English, French and Spanish) A bittersweet dream of romance from Michel Gondry. Inventive and enchanting. (Scott) * 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis) 'SNAKES ON A PLANE' (R, 105 minutes) Snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson. David R. Ellis provides the fine B-movie-style direction, while Mr. Jackson supplies the cool and his trademark epithet. (Dargis) 'SÓLO CON TU PAREJA' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Spanish) In 1991, before ''Y Tu Mama Tambien'' or ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' Alfonso Cuarón made this antic, half-dark sex comedy, in which a young ladies' man is forced to re-examine his promiscuous ways. At this point the movie, which has been released for the first time in the United States, is more of a curiosity than an event, but it does exhibit the exuberant promise that Mr. Cuarón has long since fulfilled. (Scott) 'STEP UP' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Ever since Kevin Bacon's rebellious hips ignited a small-town uproar in ''Footloose,'' the modern high school romance has placed a premium on rhythm. In ''Step Up'' a rough Baltimore kid (Channing Tatum), armed only with a killer smile and hip-hop moves, falls for a classically trained dancer (Jenna Dewan). Bland but likable, the movie fashions social equality from big musical numbers. If ballet and hip-hop can coexist, it asks, why can't we all be friends? (Catsoulis) 'TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Fast, fun and silly, with Will Ferrell as a Nascar driver, Sacha Baron Cohen as his nemesis, and a new course record for product placements per gallon. (Scott) 'THE U.S. vs. JOHN LENNON' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Using archival clips -- including some great ''Dick Cavett Show'' appearances and in-bed news conferences -- and talking-head interviews with Noam Chomsky, G. Gordon Liddy and many people in between, this documentary makes the case that John Lennon was a much better person than Richard Nixon. (Scott) 'the WICKER MAN' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In remaking a 1973 British horror classic, Neil LaBute once again demonstrates his misogyny and, worse, his technical incompetence. (Scott) Film Series ÉCLATS DE RIRE (Through Oct. 31) The French Institute Alliance Française is screening French comedies every Tuesday. This week's film is ''Liberté-Oléron'' (2001), starring Denis Podalydès as a middle-class family man on a seaside vacation. Bruno Podalydès, the star's brother, directed. Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160; $10. (Anita Gates) OTTO PREMINGER: NOTORIOUS (Through Oct. 29) Preminger, the Austrian-born director and producer who died in 1986, would have turned 100 this year. The Museum of Modern Art is celebrating with a nine-film retrospective. It begins Sunday with ''Laura'' (1944), starring Gene Tierney as the Manhattanite whose murder Dana Andrews is investigating, and ''Advise and Consent'' (1962), a study of political maneuvering in Washington. Henry Fonda is the star, but Charles Laughton (doing a Southern accent) steals the picture. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) THE PERSONAL FILMS OF SU FRIEDRICH (Through tomorrow) The Museum of Modern Art's nine-film midcareer retrospective of Ms. Friedrich's work continues today and tomorrow. The films include ''Hide and Seek'' (1996), a lesbian coming-of-age story set in the 1960's, and ''The Odds of Recovery'' (2002), an autobiographical documentary about surgery and hormones. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters; $10. (Gates) PYTHONALOT (Through Thursday) Film Forum's two-week Monty Python festival continues with three films this weekend. ''Life of Brian'' (1979) is about a hapless fellow constantly mistaken for the Messiah. ''Brazil'' (1985) is Terry Gilliam's surrealistic story of a bureaucrat in the future. ''The Meaning of Life'' (1983) is about a little of everything. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ian anderson (Thursday) Still tootling the flute after all these years, Mr. Anderson revisits the Jethro Tull catalog of blues-Celtic-progressive rock, backed by an orchestra. At 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $90.50. (Jon Pareles) BETTIE SERVEERT (Tomorrow) Bettie Serveert -- a Dutch band led by Carol van Dijk, who sings in fluent English -- has persevered since the early 1990's on the collegiate-rock circuit. She writes and sings observant songs about romantic ups and downs, continually expanding a musical vocabulary that now stretches from pop tunefulness to indie-rock guitar furor to the easy-rolling incantations of Van Morrison. With Slumber Party and the Skydrops. At 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Pareles) SIR RICHARD BISHOP (Tomorrow) O.K., so he gave himself the title, but you can't say he didn't earn it. Mr. Bishop is the guitarist for the Sun City Girls, the utterly confounding (that's high praise) semi-improvisational group that somehow emerged from the early-1980's Phoenix hardcore scene. At this solo show, expect him to show off his dazzling, sometimes frantic acoustic-guitar compositions. At 11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Kelefa Sanneh) BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Thursday) Electronica, a live rhythm section and a wildly cosmopolitan spirit meet a charismatic and unpredictable singer, Sabina Sciubba, in the Brazilian Girls. The music dips into reggae, samba, funk and house, never staying in one place for long. With Miho Hatori. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $25 in advance, $28 at the door. (Pareles) BUILT TO SPILL (Tuesday through Thursday) Wielding his guitar as if no one ever doubted the beauty of a long, slow-building solo, and unabashedly looking back to Dinosaur Jr. and Neil Young, Built to Spill's Doug Martsch applies his high voice and his earnest intelligence to songs that address both his private conflicts and his political convictions. Tuesday at 8 p.m. at Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn (718) 387-5252, warsawconcerts.com; Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $22 (Pareles) ERIC CLAPTON (Tonight and tomorrow night) The evergreen guitar hero, now 61, is touring with a repertory stretching back to his Derek and the Dominos era. Also on the bill is Robert Cray, the slick guitarist who was the great commercial hope of the blues in the 1980's. At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $49.50 to $154.50. (Ben Sisario) CARMEN CONSOLI (Sunday) A songwriter whose current album, ''Eva Contro Eva,'' reached No. 1 on the Italian pop charts, Ms. Consoli brings a rocker's gathering intensity to her songs (in Italian) about passion and principles, even when she's backed by acoustic instruments. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $22. (Pareles) CURSIVE (Sunday) Whether he's singing about imploding romances or hypocritical moralizers, Tim Kasher of Cursive works up a frazzled fervor, abetted by a band that can sound fragile, scrappy or driven. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Pareles) THOMAS DOLBY (Tonight) Mr. Dolby entered pop eternity in the guise of a bespectacled, wild-haired mad scientist, with the 1983 novelty hit ''She Blinded Me With Science.'' He returns after a long absence -- in his other life he has been an innovative creator of ring tones -- largely in the same gearhead persona (sans the hair), surrounded by bizarre-looking doohickeys with colorful gauges and oversize knobs. At 8, Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212) 941-8100, canalroom.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario) DRAGONFORCE (Tonight) A six-man metal army from London -- with members from Ukraine, Hong Kong, New Zealand and South Africa -- DragonForce sounds like some combination of Iron Maiden, the Scorpions and Yngwie Malmsteen on frantic fast-forward: all the chant-along major-key melodies and fretboard-tickling guitar solos of those 80's metal heroes are there, but sped up to an exhilarating (and comical) degree. With All That Remains and Horse the Band. At 8, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $22. (Sisario) EASY STAR ALL STARS (Wednesday) Three years ago the Easy Star label released ''Dub Side of the Moon,'' a reggae version of Pink Floyd's ''Dark Side of the Moon.'' Now comes the sequel, ''Radiodread,'' which gives Radiohead's ''OK Computer'' a similar makeover. Is this a grand extortion scheme? Did Radiohead refuse to pay up? At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, boweryballroom.com, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sanneh) GOMEZ (Thursday) This British band emerged in the mid-1990's, the heyday of Britpop, featuring an against-the-grain obsession with tight, sharp blues-rock. On its newest album, ''How We Operate'' (ATO), it has veered into folkier realms, though it still plays with unusual precision and focus. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $27. (Sisario) * THE HOLD STEADY (Sunday) Like a meeting of AC/DC and the E Street Band fronted by Shane MacGowan of the Pogues, the Hold Steady -- from Brooklyn, but with Minneapolis origins -- plays bare-knuckled guitar-rock, while its singer, Craig Finn, free-associates about religion and sex in a boozy snarl. ''I guess I've heard about original sin,'' he sings. ''I heard the dude blamed the chick.'' With Sean Na Na. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $17:50 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario) HAINO KEIJI (Monday) This focused but unpredictable Japanese musician comes to town for two different sets. During the early set he is to play classical guitar and sing; during the late one he is to play electric guitar and sing. Fans of his grand, open-ended (and sometimes earthshaking) explorations will probably want to treat the performance as a two-act play. At 8 and 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $12. (Sanneh) MADNESS (Tuesday) Back in the early 1980's, when English punks were rediscovering ska, Madness brought both a melodic sense and a working-class tenacity to its songs, and it never let ska confine its music. At 9:30 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212) 941-8100, canalroom.com;$10 in advance, $15 at the door. (Pareles) MASSIVE ATTACK (Tuesday through Thursday) Deep bass lines, eerie ambience, suave but unflinching tunes, increasingly urgent politics and an ever-changing roster of vocalists made Massive Attack pioneers of trip-hop. The group is on its first United States tour since 1998, with the reggae singer Horace Andy and Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins up front. At 7:30 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224; $50. (Pareles) MATES OF STATE (Tomorrow) Most of the time Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel, the married couple who make up Mates of State, sing insistent, almost nagging chants propelled by quick-pulse organ and drums; their latest, ''Bring It Back'' (Barsuk), also has some soothing, affectionate piano songs. With Starlight Mints. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $16. (Sisario) MEGADETH, LAMB OF GOD, OPETH, ARCH ENEMY (Tomorrow) The vanguard of heavy metal, past and present. The members of Megadeth were steely, cynical soothsayers at a time when the dominant style was poofy hair and power ballads, and they haven't changed a bit. Lamb of God, from Richmond, Va., derives some of its grinding, jackhammer-fast churn from Slayer and Pantera, and, without any irony or sarcasm, calls its style ''pure American metal.'' Opeth, from Sweden, adds intriguing depth to the usual histrionics of black metal with gentle acoustic parts and tough, growly sounds. Arch Enemy reaches back to the glory days of guttural death metal. At 4:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; $20 and $39.50. (Sisario) AMY MILLAN (Tuesday) She's a singer for the Canadian indie-rock band Stars, and a sometime member (along with slightly less than half the country) of the collective Broken Social Scene. And now she has a bittersweet, countryish new album of her own, ''Honey from the Tombs'' (Arts & Crafts). At 7 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Sanneh) MOUNTAIN GOATS (Tonight through Sunday) Would John Darnielle, a guitar-strumming solo songwriter, have found the same dedicated following for his songs if he hadn't billed himself as the Mountain Goats? It's impossible to say, but his songs swirl together the mythic and the confessional in metaphorical splendor. Tonight at 8, Europa, 98-104 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723; $16. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Pareles) * NEW YORK GYPSY FESTIVAL (Tonight through Thursday) With a thriving rock scene in New York inspired by Gypsy and Eastern European music, this series, now in its second year, has been badly needed. Costel Vasilescu, a veteran trumpeter from Romania, makes a rare appearance tonight with Slavic Soul Party, New York hipsters who have done their homework in Eastern European styles (8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, $32). Wednesday is the first of two ''Clarinet All-Stars'' concerts featuring the young Turkish clarinetist Husnu Senlendirici and the saxophonist Yuri Yunakov, a master of raucous Bulgarian wedding music (11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, $30). Other concerts include the Bulgarian singer Vlada Tomova on Monday (7 p.m., Joe's Pub, $12) and Frank London, the trumpeter and prime mover of New York's klezmer revival, on Wednesday (9 p.m., M 1-5, 52 Walker Street, TriBeCa, $20). Information: nygypsyfest.com. (Sisario) NIGHTMARE OF YOU (Wednesday) Brandon Reilly, former singer for the Long Island emo band Movielife, now leads Nightmare of You, a vaguely theatrical new-wavey band that gives him a chance to show everyone how much he loves Morrissey. With the Films and Blacklist. At 9 p.m., the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, near Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $12. (Sanneh) SECRET MACHINES (Monday and Tuesday) The slowly unfolding, keyboard-driven compositions of Secret Machines have a stark minimalist side, a glimmer of country, some pulsating and a streak of Pink Floyd grandeur that swells to fill the room. There's a haunted undercurrent amid the pomp. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $27. (Pareles) CHRIS SMITHER (Tonight and tomorrow night) With a weary, well-traveled voice and a serenely intricate fingerpicking style, Mr. Smither turns the blues into songs that accept hard-won lessons and try to make peace with fate. ''Love You Like a Man,'' the song Bonnie Raitt borrowed from him in the 1970's, only hints at the thoughtful intensity of his more recent work. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $22. (Pareles) SOUND TRIBE SECTOR NINE, JACOB FRED JAZZ ODYSSEY (Tomorrow) A jam-band double bill: Sound Tribe Sector Nine gets its steady-pulsing groove from acid jazz and electronic club music, while the Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey is a keyboard-bass-drums trio that sometimes heads for the avant-garde fringes. At 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway at West 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com, $26. (Pareles) * SUFJAN STEVENS, MY BRIGHTEST DIAMOND (Tonight through Sunday) In his continuing project to write an album about every state in America, Mr. Stevens turns gigantic ambitions into what sounds like a homemade pageant: history and memory orchestrated into pop that's both old-fashioned and indie. He'll have a string and brass ensemble here. My Brightest Diamond, led by his backup singer, Shara Worden, is very different; she reaches inward for songs full of volatile drama. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $25 (Pareles) ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme song from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show-business life. (Through Nov. 11.) At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Stephen Holden) WOLF EYES, JOHN WIESE (Thursday) The members of Wolf Eyes, a fearsomely loud and intense band from Michigan, once described themselves as ''the Lynyrd Skynyrd of noise'' and meant it. The group's rumbling, nightmarish clangor is in one sense a straightforward exposition of a kind of elemental rock artistry. Mr. Wiese, from Los Angeles, has collaborated with pretty much everybody in the noise-rock scene, from Thurston Moore and Wolf Eyes to Sunn 0))), a sign of both his impressive productivity and the incestuous smallness of that world. At 9 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12. (Sisario) * YO LA TENGO (Tonight) Yo La Tengo, the model of indie-rock perseverance, is led by its songwriters, the husband-and-wife team of Ira Kaplan on guitar and Georgia Hubley on drums. They prize succinct, tuneful songs about the modest pains and pleasures of daily life and love; they also love psychedelic excursions into feedback and fuzz-tone, and might have something grand in mind for the show at this opulent old movie palace. At 8, Landmark Loew's Jersey Theater, 54 Journal Square, Jersey City, (866) 468-7619, loewsjersey.org; $25 in advance. (Pareles) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

At 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Columbia University, 116th Street and Broadway, (212) 854-7799, millertheatre.com; $25. (Nate Chinen) * DIET COKE WOMEN IN JAZZ FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) This monthlong festival of female jazz artists concludes on what should be a high note, with a pair of superb singers, Karrin Allyson and Nancy King, and a backing trio led by the pianist Bruce Barth.

Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) RAVI COLTRANE (Sunday) Mr. Coltrane has developed into one of the more confident bandleaders on the contemporary scene, and his tenor and soprano saxophone playing suggests a thoughtful approach to improvisation that honors his father, John Coltrane, without overtly emulating him. At 8 p.m., Bar 4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, bar4.net; suggested donation, $5. (Chinen) SCOTT DUBOIS QUARTET (Sunday) Scott DuBois, a guitarist equally devoted to intricate compositional forms and spacious free improvisation, leads an ensemble stocked with kindred spirits: the alto saxophonist Loren Stillman, the bassist Thomas Morgan and the drummer Gerald Cleaver.

(Chinen) FESTIVAL OF NEW TRUMPET MUSIC (Tonight, and Tuesday through Thursday) This series, organized by Dave Douglas, presents the Rodriguez Brothers, a Latin-inspired group featuring the trumpeters Michael Rodriguez and Brian Lynch, tonight at Joe's Pub.

(Chinen) HAROLD MABERN (Tonight) Hard bop and Memphis soul are inextricable in the ensemble music of Mr. Mabern; here he'll play in a more intimate setting, as part of a new Fazioli Salon solo piano series at the Klavierhaus workshop. At 8, Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $25. (Chinen) RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA QUARTET (Tuesday and Wednesday) The alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa combines razorlike articulation with a probing improvisational style on ''Codebook'' (Pi), his scintillating new album. Here he regroups two of the musicians from the album, the bassist François Moutin and the drummer Dan Weiss, and features a fine substitute pianist, Craig Taborn. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20. (Chinen) TONY MALABY (Tonight and Sunday) Mr. Malaby, a powerful and increasingly prominent tenor saxophonist, brings a Spanish tinge to his Paloma Recio ensemble, which includes the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Nasheet Waits (tonight). He also leads a boisterous trio with Marcus Rojas on tuba and John Hollenbeck on drums (Sunday). Tonight at 9 and 10:30, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. Sunday at 9 p.m., Jimmy's No. 43, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006, freestylejazz.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) * BRANFORD MARSALIS QUARTET (Thursday) The tenor and soprano saxophonist Branford Marsalis leads one of the most athletic working bands in the modern jazz mainstream, a point of pride that he playfully acknowledges with the locker-room photo on the cover of his new album, ''Braggtown'' (Marsalis Music). The ensemble -- with Joey Calderazzo on piano, Eric Revis on bass and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums -- doesn't work often in a club setting, which makes this four-night engagement all the more significant. (Through Oct. 8.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $35. (Chinen) DANILO PÉREZ (Tonight through Sunday) As on his last album, ''Live at the Jazz Showcase'' (ArtistShare), the Panamanian pianist Danilo Pérez works with advanced rhythmic and harmonic concepts in his excellent trio with the bassist Ben Street and the drummer Adam Cruz. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $30, $25 on Sunday. (Chinen) ANDRÉ PREVIN AND DAVID FINCK (Tomorrow and Sunday) André Previn is best known as a classical pianist and conductor, but he has worked extensively as a jazz musician; in the 1950's he made a clutch of popular albums for Contemporary Records. For this rare nightclub engagement, he enlists the literate bassist David Finck and tucks into a book of songbook staples. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592 bluenote.net; cover, $45 at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) PETE ROBBINS (Monday) The choral music of the Italian Renaissance composer Carlo Gesualdo has recently provided inspiration for the creative energies of Mr. Robbins, an alto saxophonist and clarinetist. He will perform a premiere of his ''Gesualdo Adaptations,'' which features a modernistic ensemble of two saxophonists, two guitarists and an electric keyboard, along with bass and drums. At 9 p.m., Bar 4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, bar4.net; suggested donation, $5. (Chinen) * KURT ROSENWINKEL QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) Kurt Rosenwinkel's electric guitar has a beguilingly airy tone that offsets the cerebral twinge of his compositions, and his rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner borders on the telepathic. The two musicians are backed by a crack rhythm section: Aaron Parks on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Jeff Ballard on drums. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) MIKE STERN BAND (Tonight through Sunday) The guitarist Mike Stern has a goofily titled new album -- ''Who Let the Cats Out?'' (Heads Up) -- that features the quite serious electric bass playing of Richard Bona. This engagement features Mr. Bona and another contributor from the album, the saxophonist Bob Franceschini, along with the fiercely propulsive drummer Terri Lyne Carrington. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) STRIKE (Tonight) As the name implies, this is a decisive, hard-hitting ensemble, consisting of the drummer Bobby Previte and a pair of musicians similarly inclined to pair aggressive experimentation with a rock-hard sense of groove: the keyboardist Marco Benevento and the saxophonist Briggan Krauss. At 10, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) * WYNTON AND LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S HOT FIVES (Tonight and tomorrow night) The recordings made by Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five in the 1920's were an ageless and inviolable achievement. The order of names in this concert title suggests some hubris on the part of Wynton Marsalis, but he is indeed the person best suited to give the music a fresh airing. He'll be joined by the clarinetist and saxophonist Victor Goines, the trombonists Wycliffe Gordon and Vincent Gardner, the banjoist Don Vappie and the pianist Jonathan Batiste. At 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $37.50 to $127.50. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'LA BOHÈME' (Sunday) Updated to the years around World War I, this is one of New York City Opera's best productions, and some fine young talents should make this run of it worth hearing. Shu-Ying Li, the Mimi, has shown a really striking soprano on past occasions; James Valenti, her Rodolfo, was a promising Met Council winner in 2002; Elisabeth Caballero, the Musetta, made a very good City Opera debut last season; and Daniel Mobbs, the Marcello, has been proving himself reliably at Caramoor and elsewhere for several years. George Manahan, the company's music director, conducts. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Anne Midgette) 'CARMEN' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Rinat Shaham, who made her company debut as Zerlina, is a small singer for Carmen; worse, New York City Opera's production seems to have veiled her spark, rendering her a mere stereotype. Her Don José, Mark Duffin, has warm lower notes and a pressed, often flat sound on top; the Escamillo is Adrian Gans, who was too nervous to be judged at his company debut in the role. The high point is Latonia Moore, a radiant-voiced Micaëla who seems to belong to a world apart from this rather pedestrian production. Ari Pelto conducts, a little woodenly but competently enough. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $130. (Midgette) 'FAUST' (Tuesday) Ruth Ann Swenson keeps searching for a better fit at the Metropolitan Opera, or it for her. After recent departures -- Micaëla in ''Carmen,'' Mimi in ''La Bohème'' -- she's moving into a stronger role by Gounod, whose Juliette is one of her calling cards: Marguerite in ''Faust.'' Another light-voiced ''Roméo et Juliette'' veteran, Ramón Vargas, takes on the title role, while the strong, young and still-developing bass Ildar Abdrazakov is Méphistophélès. Some new faces and voices include Tommi Hakala as Valentin and Karine Deshayes as Siebel; the conductor Bertrand de Billy should provide an idiomatic reading. Andrei Serban's production drew critical ire when it opened in 2005. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000; metopera.org; $15 to $375. (Midgette) 'LA GIOCANDA' (Tomorrow) Ponchiello's opera -- with its spectacle, grand music and unfathomable plot -- returns to the Met after a long absence. Violeta Urmana and Olga Borodina take the female leads. Aquiles Machado is Enzo. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000; metopera.org; $15 to $375. (Bernard Holland) * 'IDOMENEO' (Monday) The title role of Mozart's 1781 opera seria ''Idomeneo,'' the tormented king of ancient Crete, has such heroic dimensions that some powerhouse tenors who seldom sing Mozart have embraced it. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's 1982 production for the Met has featured both the Wagnerian tenor Siegfried Jerusalem and, in more recent years, Plácido Domingo in the title role. Now one of the reigning dramatic tenors of the day, Ben Heppner, has taken the role on for the Met's current revival. The strong cast includes Dorothea Röschmann, Olga Makarina and Kristine Jepson. James Levine conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $375. (Anthony Tommasini) 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The Metropolitan Opera has inaugurated its season, and the tenure of the ambitious new general manager, Peter Gelb, with the Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella's visually beautiful production of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly.'' The abstract staging deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and, most daringly, a lifesize puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domas as Butterfly, and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Lieutenant Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. Asher Fisch takes over the conducting duties from James Levine, who led a lean and sensitive performance on opening night. Tomorrow at 1:30 and Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $375. (Tommasini) 'THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its tiny quarters on the Bowery. This weekend it continues its run of Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' with a rotat ing cast. Quality may vary, but the spirit is usually there. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Vivien Schweitzer) 'THE MERRY WIDOW' (Thursday) The Dicapo Opera company opens its season on Thursday with a new production of Franz Lehar's lively operetta ''The Merry Widow,'' which received its American premiere in 1907. The production is directed by Michael Capasso (the company's co-founder) and conducted by Constantine Kitsopoulos, with sets by John Farrell, costume design by Angela Huff and choreography (to include dancing girls) by Fran Harman. At 6 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Schweitzer) 'SEMELE' (Tomorrow) New York City Opera's bright update of Ovidian shenanigans to the Kennedy administration continues with Elizabeth Futral in the title role. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $120. (Holland) 'DIE TOTE STADT' (Tonight and Thursday) The composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold is best known for his pioneering scores for swashbuckling Hollywood films of the 1930's. But in Germany in 1920, at age 24, he was hailed as the brilliant and promising composer of a mysterious opera, ''Die Tote Stadt.'' The New York City Opera, which has been a champion of this neglected work, has revived its 1975 production, which incorporates film elements, video projections and scrims to evoke the dreamlike story. The cast, though not ideal, is appealing, and George Manahan conducts a sweeping account of Korngold's lyrically sumptuous and theatrical music. Tonight at 8 and Thursday night at 7:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Tommasini) Classical Music BACH AT ST. PETER'S (Tomorrow) It's not his birthday or a major anniversary year, but who needs an excuse to devote a day to Bach? In its annual Bach festival, St. Peter's Church is devoting the afternoon to recitals, mostly by organists (Craig Williams at 1 p.m., Walter Hilse at 2:15 and Robert McCormick at 4:45) playing some Bach, but much else as well. A potential highlight is James Priess's marimba recital (at 3:30 p.m.), at which he will perform transcriptions of the Unaccompanied Cello Suites in G, D and C. The main event, at 8 p.m., is a performance of the Mass in B minor by the St. Peter's Choir and Bach Festival Orchestra, led by Thomas Schmidt. The soloists are Mary Elizabeth Poor and Rosalind Rees, sopranos; Elsa Larsson, alto; Jonathan Kline, tenor; and Roosevelt André Credit, baritone. St. Peter's Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 935-2200, saintpeters.org; $65 pass for all events, $20 for afternoon recitals, $25 for the B minor Mass. (Kozinn) * BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This converted coffee barge is one of the most intimate chamber music halls in the city, and its programs are growing more varied all the time. Tonight the pianist Seymour Lipkin plays an all-Schubert recital that includes the four Impromptus and the Sonatas in A (D. 959) and A minor (D. 784). Then the ensembles take over. The Zephyr Trio -- Jeanne Galway on flute (you've heard of her husband, James), Darrett Adkins on cello and Jonathan Feldman on piano -- play Martinu, Debussy, Poulenc, Weber and Lowell Liebermann tomorrow. On Sunday the Vertigo String Quartet plays Wolf's ''Italian Serenade'' and quartets by Beethoven and Walton. And on Thursday Katya Mihailova, a pianist; William Harvey, a violinist; and Chris Gross, a cellist, play piano trios by Haydn, Dvorak and Adolphus Hailstork. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday nights at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35. (Kozinn) CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA (Wednesday and Thursday) The estimable Cleveland Orchestra and its music director, Franz Welser-Möst, open Carnegie Hall's season. Thomas Quasthoff sings Mahler songs, and Leif Ove Andsnes plays a Mozart piano concerto, but don't neglect this orchestra's special talent for music by Suppé and Johann Strauss. Wednesday at 7 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44 to $190 on Wednesday, $37 to $119 on Thursday. (Holland) VLADIMIR FELTSMAN (Tomorrow and Tuesday) In a surprising move from his modern piano comfort zone, this thoughtful pianist is performing all of Mozart's piano sonatas in five recitals, played on a modern copy of a Mozart-era Walter fortepiano. The recitals are split between the New School and its Mannes College of Music, with the second and third installments, this week, at Mannes. Tomorrow he plays the Sonatas in D (K. 284), C (K. 309), D (K. 311) and A minor (K. 310). The Tuesday evening installment includes the Rondo in A minor (K. 511) and the Sonatas in C (K. 330), F (K. 332), B flat (K. 333) and A (K. 331). At 7:30, Mannes College of Music, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212) 229-5488, newschool.edu/feltsman; $25; students and 65+, $10.

The performance also includes Saint-Saëns's Piano Concerto No. 4 in C minor, with You You Zhang as soloist, and the Brahms Symphony No. 1 in C Minor. At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, Broadway at 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free. (Schweitzer) SCOTT MURPHEE and KEITH PHARES (Tomorrow) The directors of the sleek and inviting Austrian Cultural Forum have been placing increased emphasis on concerts in the institution's intimate and acoustically bright recital hall. Tomorrow Scott Murphee, a young tenor who has made a specialty of American songs and has performed songs written for him by Robert Beaser, Yehudi Wyner and other composers, joins the young baritone Keith Phares, currently singing the role of Fritz in the New York City Opera's production of Korngold's ''Tote Stadt,'' for a program of works by Elliott Carter, Lee Hoiby, Jake Heggie, Richard Hundley and Schubert. At 8 p.m., Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org; free, but reservations are required.

The music is by Salvatore Sciarrino and four other composers. At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, Broadway at 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free. (Holland) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday) The concert season at the State Theater New Jersey opens tonight with visitors from across the river: the New York Philharmonic and Lorin Maazel offer a greatest-hits symphonic program that includes Mozart's Symphony No. 40 and Beethoven's ''Eroica.'' Back in New York, the Philharmonic's theme is Shostakovich, whose centennial is this year, but the greatest-hits emphasis continues: Lynn Harrell plays the first cello concerto, and the orchestra offers the Fifth Symphony. Tonight at 8, State Theater, New Brunswick, N.J., (732) 246-7469, statetheaternj.org; $60 to $90. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5656; $30 to $96 tomorrow, $28 to $94 on Tuesday. (Midgette) STEVE REICH & BERYL KOROT (Wednesday) As part of its celebration of the composer Steve Reich's 70th birthday, the Whitney Museum is mounting an installation that includes showings of ''Three Tales,'' a video collaboration between Mr. Reich and his wife, the filmmaker Beryl Korot. A meditation on technology gone out of hand, its three panels focus on the crash of the Hindenburg in 1937, the atomic bomb tests at the Bikini Atoll in 1949 and the cloning of a sheep in 1997. (Through Oct. 15.) The Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639, whitney.org; $15; students and 65+, $10. (Kozinn) WORLD MUSIC INSTITUTE (Thursday) The institute presents its ''Interpretations'' series, this time featuring the Berlin-based duo Amelia Cuni, a singer, and Werner Durand, a winds and electronics player, in arrangements of traditional Indian pieces and new works. A composer and zither player, Miya Masaoka, will lead her trio, Chironomy, which includes the tabla player Samir Chatterjee and the cornet player Taylor Ho Bynum in works that explore North Indian rhythms.

(John Rockwell) ODILE DUBOC AND CONTRE JOUR (Wednesday and Thursday) Much better known in France than in the United States, Ms. Duboc last appeared in New York on a shared program two decades ago. Ms. Duboc and her company, based in Aix-en-Provence, will present ''ODIL,'' a new piece that displays her interest in dance that is independent of music. Also on the bill are a duet set to Ravel's ''Bolero'' and inspired by Camille Claudel's sculptures, and a male trio inspired by ''The Wrestlers,'' a painting by Natalia Gontcharova. At 8 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160, www.ticketmaster.com; $25; $20 for students.

(Dunning) NOéMI LAFRANCE'S 'AGORA II' (Tonight and tomorrow night) Apparently, Noémi LaFrance, a tireless artistic explorer of public space, is a glutton for punishment. Having moved bureaucratic mountains last year to stage ''Agora'' in the enormous (and empty) McCarren Park pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she now has a sequel, ''Agora II,'' which incorporates a number of guest companies and is described in the publicity materials as ''a choreographic game for 1,000 bodies.'' Good luck to them all. At 8, McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street, between Driggs and Bayard Streets, (718) 388-6309, sensproduction.org; $20 and $30.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Art Fairs ART (212), through Sunday. New York hardly needs another contemporary-art fair, especially one whose exhibitors are mostly so-so galleries. But the name is so Manhattan, and it comes early in the season. It uses the cozy downtown 69th Regiment Armory, site of the original 1913 Armory Show. The 62 participating exhibitors come mostly from the United States and Canada. This year their displays will emphasize work by Latin American and Asian artists. The inaugural version will include the exhibitions titled ''Eyes Wide Open'' and ''Screen Culture in Asia,'' organized by curators from El Museo del Barrio and Asia Society. 69th Regiment Armory, Lexington Avenue at 26th Street, (212) 366-4139; $15; $12 for students and 65+; free for children under 12; free for all today from 6 to 9 p.m.; art-212.com. (Roberta Smith) Museums * Asia society: 'ONE WAY OR ANOTHER: ASIAN AMERICAN ART NOW,' through Dec. 10. Taking its name from a 1978 hit by the punk band Blondie, this lively exhibition finds a new vitality and freedom, especially where identity is involved, in Asian-American art. The artists' roots range from Iran to Korea; their mediums include painting, drawing, sculpture, video, photography and performance. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Smith) Brooklyn Museum: 'Looking Back from Ground Zero: Images from the Brooklyn Museum Collection,' through Dec. 27. This show presents a historical picture of Lower Manhattan from early on to the present, with the building of the World Trade Center as the pivotal point. A short film, ''Building the World Trade Center,'' produced by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1983, is an invaluable document of the triumphalist spin surrounding the construction of the complex. A small selection of artworks produced in or just after 2001 hints at the profound and conflicted feelings the destruction of the twin towers has evoked. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Holland Cotter) International Center of Photography: 'Ecotopia: The Second I.C.P. Triennial of Photography and Video,' through Jan. 7. Punctuated by big black oozing forms that are both comic and ominous, this edifying, entertaining, ecologically aware exhibition is a walk-through version of Al Gore's ''Inconvenient Truth.'' The work on view represents nearly 40 artists and photojournalists and portrays nature as variously ravishing, cute and enduring, and also increasingly dangerous and endangered, thanks to the widening scope of human indifference and exploitation. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith) * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Brush and Ink: The Chinese Art of Writing,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) The Met: 'CÉzanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde,' through Jan. 7. The come-on title of this show turns out to be slightly misleading. The star is not any of the artists. It is a dealer, Ambroise Vollard, born in 1866, arrived in Paris in 1887 from the Île de la Réunion. The works passed through Vollard's hands. Picasso bought a Matisse still life and a Renoir bather from Vollard. They're both here. So is Cézanne's ''Bathers,'' which Monet bought; and Cézanne's ''Battle of Love,'' which Renoir got. What's worth noting are less the landmarks than the byways: a Renoir portrait of Vollard dressed as a torero. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) The Met: 'New Orleans After the Flood: Photographs by Robert Polidori,' through Dec. 10. After Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Polidori went to New Orleans, where he lived years ago, to shoot photographs of the devastation for The New Yorker. He took hundreds of pictures with a large-format camera that produced wide, superbly detailed color photographs. A couple dozen of these big panoramas and interiors at the Met make a pocket-size lament for a woebegone city. They are unpeopled scenes: New Orleans as our modern Pompeii. Mr. Polidori is a connoisseur of chaos, and the beauty of his pictures -- they have a languid, almost underwater beauty -- entails locating order in bedlam. He also photographed signs of recovery: trailers and construction equipment; a few historic homes, stripped to their frames, shorn, on the verge of new life. (See above.) (Kimmelman) * THE MUSEUM AT F.I.T.: 'LOVE AND WAR: THE WEAPONIZED WOMAN,' through Dec. 16. From a museum known for elucidating both the erotic and architectural nature of clothing design, this characteristically handsome exhibition examines the influence of garments of love and seduction (lingerie) and of war (armor and military uniforms) on modern and contemporary couturiers. The Museum at F.I.T., Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 217-5800, fitnyc.edu/museum. (Smith) NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer, through Oct 9. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman) Parrish Art Museum: 'Roy Lichtenstein: American Indian Encounters,' through Dec. 31. Lichtenstein is more popularly associated with his Pop paintings, often based on comic book images, than with the works here. But in the 1950's, using a somewhat Cubist style, he explored mythic characters like medieval knights or cowboys and Indians. ''Chief Before Teepee,'' an abstract oil painting, and ''Two Wild Indians,'' a drawing, both from 1952, were unearthed by the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation for the show's run at the Montclair Art Museum last year. Other discovered works include ''Death of General Wolfe,'' a 1951 watercolor, and ''Untitled (Two Chippewa Building Canoe?),'' a little-known painting from 1952. Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton, N.Y., (631) 283-2118, Ext. 32, parishart.org. (Carol Vogel) RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter) Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Nadine Robinson: Alles Grau,' 'Quid Pro Quo: Rashawn Griffin, Karyn Olivier and Clifford Owen: 2005-06 Artists-in-Residence,' and 'Beyond Sight,' through Oct. 22. The Studio Museum in Harlem is looking sharp with three concurrent shows, the outstanding one being a single big sound-sculpture by Nadine Robinson. It expands her political purview from imperialism to Armageddon, with hundreds of speakers embedded in an 11-foot-high gray-black wall unit that generate a sampling of satanic film scores (''The Omen,'' ''The Matrix''), mixed with funeral chants and Rastafarian dance music. ''Quid Pro Quo'' is a showcase for the 2005-6 artists in residence, all interdisciplinarians with a sweet-and-sour Dadaist touch. Mr. Owens, with performance, looks intriguingly volatile. And you won't want to leave the museum without checking out ''Beyond Sight,'' the work of the 14 teenagers. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseuminharlem.org. (Cotter) * The Whitney Museum of American Art: Mark Grotjahn, through Jan. 7. Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shield-like frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea Ken Gonzales-Day In the process of researching a book called ''Lynching in the West: 1850-1935,'' this Los Angeles artist assembled an archive and made a discovery: in the more than 350 California lynchings he found records for, most of the victims were Latinos. His photographic show at Cue Foundation is an interpretive response to this fact, largely through altered historical photographs, in which the hanged figure is erased, and the spectators left intact. Cue Art Foundation, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 206-3583, cueartfoundation.org, through Oct. 14. (Cotter). Natalie Jeremijenko Ms. Jeremijenko's show at Postmasters is a collective enterprise, her collaborators being several environmentally savvy architect/designers and untold numbers of New York City birds. Together they raise quality-of-life issues about avian urban congestion, nutrition and adjustment to diversity. Ms. Jeremijenko's point: all species are connected. Her Franciscan demonstrations of how this is so are wise, witty and oddly fierce. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212) 727-3323, postmastersart.com, through Oct. 7. (Cotter) Dona Nelson The painter Dona Nelson is in midcareer, and her work process is more experimental than ever, on the evidence of the four large pieces in this show. One is made with layers of hosed-down pigment; another is festooned with ropes of stiffened cloth; a third is a rubbing from an earlier painting; a fourth is reversible. In messing around with form, Ms. Nelson lets beauty fall where it may, which makes her art feel exciting and awake. Thomas Erben Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, fourth floor, (212) 645-8701, thomsaserben.com, through Oct. 21. (Cotter) * RIVANE NEUENSCHWANDER: OTHER STORIES AND STORIES OF OTHERS The New York gallery debut of this young Brazilian artist is beautifully in step with the somewhat pious trend of making art out of almost nothing to circumvent the big, bad art market. In video, collages and typewriter drawings, randomness rules, and the centerpiece makes everyday magic from fans and bushels of bright tissue-paper circles. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com, through Oct. 14. (Smith) SARAH OPPENHEIMER: 554-5251 In the latest labor-intensive, wall-piercing installation to treat the gallery space as a malleable object, portions of the white cube have been sliced open and seemingly formed into two enormous tubes. Part tunnel, part basket and mostly plywood, these cut through the space, revealing the storage area and windows normally hidden from view, and requiring some walking in a crouched position. P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, (212) 647-1077, ppowgallery.com, through Oct. 7. (Smith) * Mark Wagner and C. K. Wilde Mark Wagner and C. K. Wilde -- collagists, collaborators and co-founders of the Brooklyn Artists Alliance -- may or may not make money fromtheir art, but for sure they make their art from money. Mr. Wagner works with green-and-white United States currency, Mr. Wolfe with a rainbow of international tender. From tiny pieces of both they assemble intensely detailed pictures of staggering virtuosity, with Mr. Wilde specializing in cut-and-paste remakes of Goya's ''Disasters of War.'' Pavel Zoubok Gallery, 533 West 23rd Street, (212) 675-7490, pavelzoubok.com, through Oct. 7. (Cotter) Last Chance Morgan Library & Museum: CELEBRATING REMBRANDT: ETCHINGS FROM THE MORGAN, On the occasion of the opening of its newly rethought home, the Morgan Library has mounted a show of 50 of its greatest Rembrandt etchings. The selection demonstrates the range of the master's subjects (from the heights of biblical tragedy to the casually erotic) and also his amazingly expressive technique. It serves as reminder that Rembrandt's prints represent genius of the plainest, most accessible sort: sustaining classics that encompass the earthy and the exalted and offer fresh meanings with each encounter. Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) Queen Sofía Spanish Institute: 'Albert Ràfols-Casamada, Paintings, 1950-2005,' This institute has devoted its two galleries to a half-century survey of the Spanish painter Albert Ràfols-Casamada. Blocky, indistinct shapes floating in broad expanses of watery color are the rule, for Mr. Ràfols-Casamada is a devotee of a brand of soft-edge, gesture-oriented, color-loving abstraction that was very chic in the 1950's and 60's. If there is something original about Mr. Ràfols-Casamada's work, it is his feathery layering of paint. His ambition is nothing much greater than this: eye-pleasing pictures suffused with harmony, rhythm and balanced color relations. 84 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 628-0420, queensofiaspanishinstitute.org; closes today. (Benjamin Genocchio) Alison Elizabeth Taylor This artist's wood-veneer inlay images dwell on the darker side of the suburban idyll. Sexual tension, waste, bigotry and violence underlie their luxurious-looking surfaces, along with a gnawing estrangement from nature: in this case, mostly the desert landscape around Las Vegas, where Ms. Taylor grew up. Couples and small groups of people embody fractured, ambiguous relationships in her carefully constructed marquetry ''paintings.'' James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)"

2006-09-29T00:00:00Z,"The White House ignored an urgent warning in September 2003 from a top Iraq adviser who said that thousands of additional American troops were desperately needed to quell the insurgency there, according to a new book by Bob Woodward, the Washington Post reporter and author. The book describes a White House riven by dysfunction and division over the war. The warning is described in ''State of Denial,'' scheduled for publication on Monday by Simon & Schuster. The book says President Bush's top advisers were often at odds among themselves, and sometimes were barely on speaking terms, but shared a tendency to dismiss as too pessimistic assessments from American commanders and others about the situation in Iraq."
2006-09-29T00:00:00Z,"Diner's Guide presents excerpts from recent restaurant reviews. Da Silvano Since its 1975 opening, Da Silvano has evolved from a trailblazing showcase of unadorned Tuscan cooking to something of a downtown Elaine's, beloved by celebrities, along with many regular folks, and steered by a proprietor, Silvano Marchetto, with his own luster. It's got a pleasantly rustic atmosphere, jolting currents of adrenaline, a predictable menu and food -- some blissful, some inedible -- that illustrates how maddeningly uneven a restaurant can be. Try the buffalo milk mozzarella, taglierini contadina and rabbit. Tread carefully. 260 Avenue of the Americas, at Houston Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 982-2343. Pasta dishes and main courses, $19.50 to $58.50. * [Rating: One Star] Freemans A forlorn alley, a few walls of taxidermy and hot artichoke dip: these are the blocks with which Freemans built its formidable success, underscored by an expansion in early 2006 that increased the number of seats to 105 from about 60. It's an ultracool enclave: the confluence of the Lower East Side, Appalachia, a British hunting lodge and a suburban 1950's dinner party. Drop by and drink up, but order carefully. The filet mignon with horseradish cream was fine; the grilled trout and the poached chicken, not so much. And gird yourself for service that can be brittle and dismissive. End of Freeman Alley, off Rivington Street, between the Bowery and Chrystie Street, Lower East Side; (212) 420-0012. Dinner entrees, $12 to $26. Satisfactory. Trestle on Tenth Extending the recently formed restaurant row on 10th Avenue another few dozen feet to the north, Trestle on Tenth serves rebelliously hearty and sometimes seductively homey fare that reflects the Swiss upbringing of its chef and owner, Ralf Kuettel. On a concise menu with standouts like saddle of lamb, veal kidneys and pork loin, there were a few too many disappointments, but Mr. Kuettel, who knows wine, has put together a list of affordable, adventurous selections from small producers, most of them European. It's a model of what a restaurateur without tons of money or storage space can do. 242 10th Avenue, at 24th Street, Chelsea; (212) 645-5659, trestleontenth.com. Dinner entrees, $18 to $25. * [Rating: One Star] Japonais An offshoot of a restaurant already established in Chicago and bound for Las Vegas, Japonais inhabits a genre of glossy, gargantuan Asian-fusion extravaganzas that has gone from plump to morbidly obese in no time flat. That doesn't mean it and its Japanese-French cooking aren't enjoyable at times. A riff on Peking duck was wonderful, as were some of the sushi rolls. But the kitchen's performance was erratic, the service was often off-key, and the whole production is familiar to anyone who's spent time in Morimoto, Ono, Nobu 57 and so many other peers. Anyone who hasn't may well find Japonais enchanting. 111 East 18th Street, Manhattan; (212) 260-2020. Sashimi, sushi and sushi rolls, $3 to $38; entrees, $26 to $58. * [Rating: One Star] What the stars mean: (None) Poor to satisfactory; * Good; ** Very good; *** Excellent; **** Extraordinary."

2006-09-29T00:00:00Z,"The Democratic vote in the Senate on Thursday against legislation governing the treatment of terrorism suspects showed that party leaders believe that President Bush's power to wield national security as a political issue is seriously diminished. The most vivid example of the Democratic assessment came from the party's many presidential hopefuls in the Senate. All of them voted against the bill, apparently calculating that Mr. Bush's handling of Iraq has undercut the traditional Republican strength on national security and will insulate them from what are certain to be strong attacks from Republicans not only this year but also in 2008."

At first they seem to hail from a time when Frank Stella's shaped paintings, with their repeating bands of metallic color, had painters doing everything possible to avoid conventional paint on canvas and square corners. But ultimately Mr. Lefcourt's efforts layer together enough ideas of their own to land in the present, where abstraction is neither a dead horse nor a religious calling."

The article said that the inspector general in a 2004 report had described J. Steven Griles, a deputy secretary accused of more than two dozen ethical lapses, as a ''train wreck waiting to happen.'' That quotation was taken out of context. The quotation said in full: ''Framed within the context of a train wreck waiting to happen, the Department of the Interior was presented with its most complex set of ethical issues with Mr. J. Steven Griles appointment at a time that, following years of neglect, demise and compartmentalization, the ethics program was wholly incapable of addressing them.'' The article also said that Mr. Griles resigned after the accusations against him surfaced. In fairness, the article should have made clear that his resignation came nine months after a government ethics office and his boss concluded that he had committed no ethical breach. The article also said that efforts to reach Mr. Griles for comment the night before publication were unsuccessful. But the article was posted on the Web site of The Times that night shortly after a message was left for Mr. Griles. In fairness, further efforts should have been made to contact Mr. Griles between the time of the Web posting and the final deadline for the print edition."

It's a portrait that stands in stark contrast to the laudatory one Mr. Woodward drew in ''Bush at War,'' his 2002 book, which depicted the president -- in terms that the White House press office itself has purveyed -- as a judicious, resolute leader, blessed with the ''vision thing'' his father was accused of lacking and firmly in control of the ship of state."

2006-09-30T00:00:00Z,"Financial Impact of Film Piracy A new report from the Institute for Policy Innovation, a conservative Texas-based research group, has found that motion-picture piracy not only hurts the movie industry but also results in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs outside the industry and costs billions of dollars in lost wages, lost tax revenue and diminished overall economic output. The report was released yesterday at a Washington news conference held in conjunction with the United States Chamber of Commerce's third annual antipiracy and counterfeiting summit. As a starting point, the report, written by Stephen E. Siwek, used a study commissioned by the Motion Picture Association of America in 2004 and released in May that determined what revenues movie companies would have earned if pirated products had not been available; it found a loss of $6.1 billion in 2005. According to the new report, a domino effect ensues, affecting many other industries.

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"THE first thing the hostess at Trattoria Lucia asked my husband after he requested a table for four was: ''Will you be needing any high chairs?'' Not singular but plural -- high chairs -- as though there was a real possibility that he had two children under the age of 2 in tow. ''Family friendly'' is a term tossed around fairly loosely in the context of restaurants, but Trattoria Lucia raises family friendliness to an art form. Here, children in high chairs and booster seats abound, feasting by hand on buttered spaghetti and fried calamari. Teenagers happily palm big slices of pizza. Everybody loves the gelato."

Haight's works, mainly institutional and ecclesiastical, include the double quadrangle of the General Theological Seminary in Chelsea and St. Ignatius of Antioch Episcopal Church at 552 West End Avenue.

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"DIG we must for a better New York. Over the summer, Judlau Contracting Inc. of College Point, Queens, won a $428 million contract, along with a Spanish construction company, to carve a 22-foot-high tunnel through hard rock 140 feet deep under the Upper East Side, as part of a project to connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"TULIA: Race, Cocaine, and Corruption in a Small Texas Town, by Nate Blakeslee. (PublicAffairs, $14.95.) From 2000 to 2003, Tulia, in the Texas panhandle, became notorious for a bogus drug sting that unjustly sent many of the town's blacks to prison. A native Texan, Blakeslee broke the story for The Texas Observer, drawing national attention to the arrests, which were based on the inconsistent testimony of a single undercover officer. ''Tulia'' follows the legal battle that ultimately led to the reversal of the convictions, and is a devastating critique of Texas' judicial system and the nation's drug laws. Our reviewer, Sara Mosle, called ''Tulia'' a ''riveting legal thriller'' that resembles a ''modern-day 'To Kill a Mockingbird' -- or would, that is, if the novel were a true story and Atticus had won.''"
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"WHEN Stevens Cadet didn't show up at Elmont Memorial Junior-Senior High School for a Saturday morning test-preparation session one day last year, he got a call from his teacher, Patricia Klein, who keeps the telephone numbers of her students programmed into her cellphone. ''Wake up, it's Saturday,'' Stevens, now 14, recalled Ms. Klein's saying into the phone. If she had not awakened him, Stevens said, one of his friends would have called to urge him to get to class. ''Most of the kids are here on Saturday, and the faculty is always here,'' he said."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"FOR more than 40 years, this North Shore hamlet of about 15,000 people has not had a hotel. Then came a proposal for not one but two hotels, within a short distance of each other on Main Street. The proposals have raised concerns in Port Washington and surrounding municipalities about increased traffic and the size of the buildings. The need for a hotel, however, appears to be generally accepted."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"The Real Room, a corridorlike space near the entrance to Real Art Ways, is usually devoted to young and emerging artists. But this month it plays host to the drawings of Ken Morgan, a Connecticut resident whose tightly focused, energetic drawings pick up on wider art world trends. On view are four dozen miniature pen and ink sketches on ledger paper. They are minimal, but instantly captivating, the little doodlelike designs seemingly bursting out of the page. And they do, in a way, for Mr. Morgan sometimes combines multiple sheets of paper, tearing open the top layers to give his drawings depth and texture. A viewer's first impression is of abstract designs, since the sketches don't look like anything familiar. But more patient viewing reveals glimpses of another world -- broken, fragmentary scenes from the artist's unusual childhood."

But even with one more improbable victory, the Astros still might not be able to save their season."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"TAKING BACK SUNDAY, of Amityville, has sold nearly two million records. Head Automatica, fronted by Daryl Palumbo of Bellmore, is on the cover of the underground rock magazine Alternative Press this month. Brand New, of Levittown, had the top-ranked album in the emo category in Rolling Stone in 2003. These bands, along with their brethren like Nightmare of You, and Men, Women and Children, have been part of a recent spike in Long Island musical exports that calls to mind the heyday of Lou Reed, Pat Benatar and Billy Joel. A few years back, theirs was a more or less cohesive sound falling into the category of emo: a navel-gazing sensitive guy's rock music, with lyrics full of teen angst. These days, the category is being transformed by some of the same players who spawned it."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"NEW YORK is one of the few states without unilateral no-fault divorce, which means that New York couples can get a no-fault divorce only by mutual agreement. Judith Kaye, New York State's chief judge, set out to change all that. Earlier this year, the matrimonial commission she formed recommended that the state enact full unilateral no-fault divorce. Judge Kaye highlighted the proposal in her annual address about the state of the judiciary, and the idea was promptly endorsed by the New York Bar Association and the Women's Bar Association, as well as major newspapers."

Aquaterre became One Rockefeller Park. One Rockefeller Park begat Riverhouse, One Rockefeller Park. Then the marketers rested and said it was good. Such were the permutations that went into the marketing and naming of Riverhouse, a 31-story condominium under construction at the northern end of Battery Park City, across the street from the riverfront Nelson A.

Today's game against the Texans should be the first chance for the Miami offense to break out, and Brown, with wide receiver CHRIS CHAMBERS, should be the biggest beneficiaries. Lone Star Cowboys wide receiver TERRY GLENN was expected to have a drop in production this season, but he has stood out as the team's top option despite the addition of TERRELL OWENS. With Owens nursing a broken hand and fending off reporters curious about his recent overdose, Glenn may be asked to shoulder more of the load against an awful Titans defense, ranked 29th in the league. Smash Mouth The Vikings' CHESTER TAYLOR has brought a power-running game to the team, with Coach Brad Childress embracing his straight-ahead running style. Averaging 25 carries a game through three weeks, Taylor will try to be the first back to rush for more than 100 yards against the Bills this season. Running and Gunning Lost amid a season that has started 0-3, Browns quarterback CHARLIE FRYE, above, has rushed for three touchdowns and has increased his passing yardage each week, topping out last week at 298 yards against a tough Ravens defense. Frye should be able to use the second-year wide receiver BRAYLON EDWARDS as a deep threat against the Raiders, a team that has the same record as the Browns, but none of the upside."

That afternoon my boyfriend, Andrew, was having a snooze, so I got my binoculars and camera and went for a wander. I got fantastic photos of the mangroves in silhouette, with the sun setting behind them, and saw some woodpeckers, which we don't have in Australia.

A -- Martin M. Appelbaum, a certified public accountant in Manhattan, said assessments levied by a condominium board for capital improvements, whether paid as a lump sum or in monthly increments, can indeed be used to increase the tax basis of individual units, thus reducing the profit when the apartment is sold. This assumes that the board has complied with Internal Revenue Service guidelines. Mr. Appelbaum said that under I.R.S. regulations affirmed in numerous court decisions, the board must pass a resolution and notify unit owners that the funds being raised will be used for capital improvements only and not for operating expenses or ordinary repairs."

Cheng Ching Wang was born in Peking China October 17, 1918 the younger son of Wang Han Su and Wang Wen Shuen, a military general and later, War Minister under Generalissimo Chiang-kai-chek. He graduated from Yenching University with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Chemistry in 1938. After working in the National Oil Refinery in Chungking China from 1939 to 1941 he served in the Chinese Nationalist Army from 1941 to 1943 as a Lieutenant Colonel during which time he married Florence Wu in 1942, in Chungking, then the war capital of China. In April 1943, after flying over the Himalayas to Calcutta, then sailing in an unarmed and unescorted British ship, he arrived in the U.S. where he obtained a Masters Degree in Chemical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1945. After a stint as Development Engineer at Dupont and Firestone from 1945 to 1947, he returned to China in 1947, obtaining an Honorable Discharge from the Nationalist Army with a rank of Colonel. In 1947 he founded Summit Industrial Company, and in 1948, U.S. Summit Corporation with three of his beloved classmates from MIT: Dr. C.D. Shiah, J.T.Shaw and P.M. Yen. They named the company to represent the sum of MIT. Together they went on to build an international pharmaceutical distribution business, a trading company and an oil refining business. They were among the first pioneers of modern industry in Asia after the turmoil of World War II. Throughout a life filled with adventure, exploration, and a passion for business, he did have a few other abiding loves--golf (he owned a private course in Westchester for over 35 years) and homes: He maintained residences in NYC, Pound Ridge, Palm Beach, Southampton, Singapore and Shanghai. He remained a true devotee to all things beautiful, a man of great insight and wisdom and someone who possessed an unfailing passion and respect for life. He also honored a lifelong commitment to his beloved wife Florence and his family. Although he never foresaw owning a fashion business, he was the sole backer of the Vera Wang Company and served as Chairman from its inception in 1990 to 1998. His many business positions were as follows: Director, Singapore Petroleum Company Pte. Ltd., Chairman & President, Oceanic Petroleum Corporation, Chairman & President, Oceanic Pe troleum (Asia) Corporation, Chairman & President of Summit Group of Companies, Chairman of the Vera Wang Group 1990-1998. He is survived by his daughter Vera, son Kenneth, son-in-law Arthur Becker, daughter-in-law Doreen Wang, a sister Wang Pe-chen, a member of the Chinese parliament of the Republic of China for 43 years, and three grandsons, Kevin, Darren and Harry Wang, and two granddaughters, Cecilia and Josephine Becker. He passed away on September 14th at the age of 87. The Memorial Service for C.C. Wang will be held at 1:00 p.m. on Thursday, October 19th at Christ Church, 520 Park Avenue in New York City. Donations may be made in memory of C.C. Wang to Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center."

In fact, American journalists reporting from Germany in the 1930's worried about providing balance in news stories about German Jews. A 1935 journalism textbook actually used ''the Jewish persecution by the German Nazi government'' to illustrate the need for ''both sides in a controversial matter'' to be ''given a chance to have their position stated.'' Balance was necessary, the text explained, because the story is about a struggle ''between rival groups, each of which is strong in its own right, and each of which is anxious to get as much propaganda across to newspaper readers as is possible.''

To illustrate the dubiousness of this premise, I would point out that there was a generation of students on American campuses in the 60's and 70's who stood shoulder to shoulder with self-declared socialists and flagrantly liberal professors, all wanting to start the revolution. Many of these baby boomers voted for Republicans in the last two elections. So much for the influence of those professors.

After that day I learned two things: not everyone was as lucky as I was, and because of that uniform no one need know her family's situation."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"Playing is optional this weekend for the Yankees' regular lineup. Derek Jeter is in it and charging toward a batting title, one point behind the leader with one game to play. Jason Giambi took a day to rest his left wrist, which almost certainly needs surgery. Manager Joe Torre named Gary Sheffield as his first baseman for the playoffs yesterday, and that was a relief to Giambi, who will be limited to being a designated hitter. He took grounders during batting practice and said, ''It felt like my glove was coming off.''"
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"JOE TORRE was never the victim of his father's abuse, but growing up in a violent household still left a mark on him. Mr. Torre remembers the shouting and the screaming as his father tormented his mother, Margaret. He can remember standing in the kitchen, as his father -- a police officer -- escalated the terror by reaching into a drawer for his revolver. He recalls his older brothers and sisters trying to shield him, the youngest of five, from what was going on. Yet even into his mid-50's, Mr. Torre, the manager of the Yankees, who is now 66, hadn't connected his feelings of insecurity and anxiety to growing up in a violent home. It wasn't until he attended a weekend self-help retreat in 1995 with his wife, Ali, that he began to connect emotionally with his childhood."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"EACH year, more than 140,000 New Yorkers are injured on the job. For most, the main source for paying medical expenses and replacing lost wages is the workers' compensation system. As a lawyer whose career is devoted to representing these injured workers, I have spoken to thousands of people over the years about their individual cases and about the limitations of the system. I've spent many unhappy hours explaining that even though someone may not be able to pay rent or feed his family on his benefit amount, he is getting the most the law allows. Often, I have had to tell clients that they cannot have necessary medical testing or treatment until they get approval from their insurance company. And recently, I have had to explain to workers with problems related to 9/11 that they've missed the deadline for claims because of technicalities in the Workers' Compensation Law."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"On a recent KLM flight from Amsterdam to Kilimanjaro, I was bumped from business class to economy, despite a confirmed reservation and seat assignment, because of overbooking. The KLM agent said I'd be reimbursed for the difference between the two fares for this leg of the trip. I had paid $4,300 for my round-trip business-class ticket; on the day I booked, the lowest coach fare was $1,300, so I naively assumed KLM would reimburse me half the difference -- $1,500. Eight weeks later, Northwest Airlines (a partner of KLM) credited my Visa account with $105, explaining that their calculation of the fare difference for a refund is based on an internal formula, unrelated to the relative price of the fares at the date of purchase. Do I have any recourse? -- Robert Munoz, Seattle Your flight was covered by the new European Union rules for consumer compensation, under which you could have chosen to volunteer your seat in return for cash negotiated with the airline; in that case, you should also be offered a refund or another flight, meals, refreshments and overnight accommodation if necessary. Compensation varies according to length of flight and delay in getting to your destination. Passengers who are bumped, or whose flight has been canceled, can claim compensation of up to 600 euros, or $760 at $1.29 to the euro, for a delay of more than four hours."

It would be hard to find a thicker, richer brew than the one that Angela Ingrao whips up in the back room of Cocoa, her pink and brown closet of a chocolate shop in downtown Larchmont. What makes Ms. Ingrao's chocolate extraordinary is that it has only a trace of sweetness, just enough to dull the bitter edge of cocoa and to enhance the intense chocolate flavor.

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"FOR the past five springs, a pair of Baltimore Orioles has returned to our yard to nest. This year I was worried. The last I had seen of the dazzling orange patriarch, he was bravely, desperately leading a screeching redtail hawk away from his brood. Then they all vanished. Thus when Daddy-O returned this spring, I rejoiced -- and followed the flash of wings to the hammocklike nest swinging high in our maple tree. The fledging of the ensuing baby orioles took place at a tender time in our human nest; our 16-year-old son, Sam, had gotten his driver's permit. It was a milestone I've dreaded since he began taking solid food. So it was only natural that I would do the sappy Mom thing and anthropomorphize the avian drama. I envied Mama Oriole her apparent sangfroid as the baby birds plunged, flapping, into the void. The female chick was cautious, taking short test flights to nearby branches. Her two snazzy brothers favored the kamikaze approach; death-defying free falls landed them, tweeting and flailing, in the trumpet vine. Every time they made it back to the nest, a squawky fracas ensued that sounded to my fretful maternal ears like a warbled equivalent of ''What were you thinking?''"

Anyone who has spent any time on Clinton Street knows that it is one of the only truly integrated neighborhoods left in this city.

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''The Mayor's War on Poverty'' (editorial, Sept. 24) appropriately praises the mayor's Commission for Economic Opportunity for its systematic plan to reduce poverty. However, its limited vision for the nation's wealthiest and most unequal city is disappointing. The commission's focus on children under 5, working poor adults and young people out of work and school perpetuates the unfair distinction between ''deserving'' and ''undeserving'' poor. Further, this choice includes only half of those living in poverty. This segmentation makes it harder to tackle the real causes of poverty: low wages, insufficient jobs, inadequate schools and poor health."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In a letter in the Book Review (Sept. 17), Martin Davis, a logician for whom I have enormous respect, charges me with a double blunder. I asserted in my review of Janna Levin's novel, ''A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines'' (Sept. 3), that Kurt Gödel, in proving the incompleteness of arithmetic, and Alan Turing, in proving the undecidability of logic, both exploited the ancient paradox of the liar. Davis claims I am wrong on each count: Gödel's work ''in no way 'exploits' '' this paradox, he says, and Turing's work ''has nothing whatever to do with the liar paradox.'' But it is Davis who -- uncharacteristically -- errs here. In crucial parts of their proofs, both Gödel and Turing do indeed exploit the self-referential flip that is the essence of the liar paradox. And I am hardly the only one to have noticed the connection that Davis denies. ''The key idea [in Gödel's incompleteness proof] was to modify the ancient Antinomy of the Liar,'' writes John W. Dawson Jr., Gödel's biographer and the co-editor of his collected works (''Logical Dilemmas: The Life and Work of Kurt Gödel,'' Page 65). As for Turing, the distinguished French logician Gilles Dowek writes that ''one recognizes in [Turing's] argument a variation on the paradox of Epimenides, the Cretan philosopher who claimed that all Cretans are liars'' (''La Logique,'' Page 47). I might not be grousing about this if the Book Review hadn't printed Davis's letter concerning my supposed falsehoods under the heading ''Liar, Liar.'' That stung. Jim Holt New York"

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"An essay last Sunday about Tasti D-Lite and its customers referred incorrectly to its business structure and its relationship with its parent company, and also misstated the location of that company's corporate headquarters. Tasti D-Lite is a trademark of A Matter of Taste Inc.; it is not a corporation. In addition, it operates under a licensing model; it is not a franchise. A Matter of Taste Inc. has its offices on the Upper East Side, not near Herald Square."

The company, based in Manhattan and best known for its test-preparation books and courses, amended the year-old employment contract of its chief financial officer, Andrew J. Bonanni, to include reimbursement of up to $375 a month in parking expenses."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"The cozy, unostentatious Vanilla Bean Café in Pomfret, inside a restored 19th-century barn at the crossroads of Routes 44, 97 and 169, may look like it is in the middle of nowhere. But people in this part of the state know better. When two brothers and a sister -- Barry, Brian and Eileen Jessurun -- opened the cafe in 1989, it had 16 seats. Now there are two large rooms, one big enough for the music groups that perform folk, bluegrass, blues or jazz every Saturday night. The Bean, as it is called, is the most popular drop-by spot in the area, with good food freshly prepared at moderate prices."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"Residents of the Town of Huntington who own hybrid or other alternative-fuel vehicles will be eligible for a variety of free parking benefits under a law adopted Tuesday by the town board. They can receive free parking at all town meters, free beach passes and free parking at the town's four Long Island Rail Road stations beginning Jan. 1. Stuart Besen, the councilman who sponsored the measure, said Huntington was the first municipality in the state to offer such incentives. He said a goal of the law was to create a demand for such vehicles so that car makers will mass-produce them."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"FOR more than 40 years, this North Shore hamlet of about 15,000 people has not had a hotel. Then came a proposal for not one but two hotels, within a short distance of each other on Main Street. The proposals have raised concerns in Port Washington and surrounding municipalities about increased traffic and the size of the buildings. The need for a hotel, however, appears to be generally accepted."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"NEW YORK STATE requires a lot of people to report suspicions of child abuse. It is surprising to find certain professions, like chiropractors, podiatrists and dental hygienists, on the state's list of ''mandated reporters.'' Others, like pediatricians, social workers and psychologists, are more predictable, since they regularly work with children. Teachers and school administrators are also no-brainers. They are knowledgeable about child development and are attuned to day-to-day behavioral changes. Sometimes, a teacher is the only safe adult in a child's life."

Indeed? It was precisely Venezuela's adherence to free-market reforms that proved utterly devastating, sparking massive urban riots in Caracas in 1989."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"MASSIVE ATTACK is one of those British groups that -- to its members' credit, perhaps -- has never quite made sense in America. Across the ocean Massive Attack helped set the agenda for British music in the 1990's, helping to inspire a generation of singers and rappers and D.J.'s; performers ranging from Dizzee Rascal to Beth Orton owe this group a debt. Suffice it to say that the group's 1991 debut album, ''Blue Lines,'' didn't thrill Americans quite the same way. But in the years since, Massive Attack has built a respectable cult of fans here. And this week it is scheduled to arrive in New York for a three-night stand at the Roseland Ballroom in support of a recent greatest-hits compilation (of sorts), ''Collected'' (Virgin). The group emerged from the Bristol hip-hop scene, but right from the start Massive Attack's sound drew heavily from reggae and jazzy R&B. (The reggae singer HORACE ANDY is a longtime collaborator, and he is touring with the group.) Massive Attack often used hip-hop beats to build songs that were both dreamy and heavy, and early singles (like ''Safe From Harm'' and ''Unfinished Sympathy'') helped pioneer the genre that's sometimes called trip-hop. Compared with American rap records, Massive Attack productions sound smooth and slightly posh, but in Britain the group's rise felt a bit like an insurgency: proof that hip-hop-inspired music need not sound like an imitation of America. (The group also helped birth a British star: the raspy, slow-motion rapper Tricky.) Since ''Blue Lines,'' Massive Attack has released three more full-length albums, and the genre known in Britain as ''urban music'' has spawned its own subgenres, like grime; compared with that frenetic style, Massive Attack's mellow tracks seem old fashioned but not unwelcome. And while it's not usually a great sign when a group decides it's time for a victory lap, this one is certainly well earned. Tuesday through Thursday at 8 p.m., 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $50."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"The big news this week: the return of ''LOST'' (ABC, 9 p.m. Wednesday). The nearly as big news: the return of ''VERONICA MARS'' (CW, 9 p.m. Tuesday). But it's a rich seven days in less publicized precincts too. On PBS it's practically a premiere week, not that the network would be so crass as to call it that. There are new seasons of ''FRONTLINE'' (Tuesday; check local listings for all PBS programs), which kicks off in a timely manner with ''Return of the Taliban,'' and ''AMERICAN EXPERIENCE'' (Monday), which takes another route: the first PBS broadcast since 1993 of the much-honored civil rights documentary ''Eyes on the Prize.'' Also new is an episode of the recurring science magazine ''NOVA SCIENCENOW'' (Tuesday) that includes a look at whether the asteroid Apophis will hit Earth, and Bill Moyers's latest news program, ''MOYERS ON AMERICA'' (Wednesday), which begins with a reconstruction of the Abramoff scandal. On completely different, but no less serious, notes: ''SOUTH PARK'' (Comedy Central, 10 p.m. Wednesday), the one place where they really know what satire means, returns for its 10th season. ''THE STREET'' (BBC America, 10 p.m. Tuesday), a six-part drama set on a street in a northern English town, has impressive credentials: the cast includes Jim Broadbent, Jane Horrocks and Timothy Spall, and the lead writer is Jimmy McGovern, who created the series ''Cracker'' and wrote the fine feature film ''Liam.'' And finally -- O.K., this is less serious -- the season premiere of that show all those people you don't know are watching, ''BATTLESTAR GALACTICA'' (Sci Fi, 9 p.m. Friday). What's a Cylon, you ask? All you need to know is that it's much better looking than a Klingon."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"Some of the best, and certainly the most provocative, artworks in the Hudson River Valley right now are scattered along the riverfront in two new displays -- one enduring, the other endearingly temporary. Outdoor sculpture and site-specific installations are part of the Peekskill Project, a dynamic, monthlong citywide exhibition, now in its third year, sponsored by the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art in Peekskill. This year's presentation features work by 111 artists selected by 16 curators and placed at about 70 sites around the town and riverfront. It can take days to see everything."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"FOR the past five springs, a pair of Baltimore Orioles has returned to our yard to nest. This year I was worried. The last I had seen of the dazzling orange patriarch, he was bravely, desperately leading a screeching redtail hawk away from his brood. Then they all vanished. Thus when Daddy-O returned this spring, I rejoiced -- and followed the flash of wings to the hammocklike nest swinging high in our maple tree. The fledging of the ensuing baby orioles took place at a tender time in our human nest; our 16-year-old son, Sam, had gotten his driver's permit. It was a milestone I've dreaded since he began taking solid food. So it was only natural that I would do the sappy Mom thing and anthropomorphize the avian drama. I envied Mama Oriole her apparent sangfroid as the baby birds plunged, flapping, into the void. The female chick was cautious, taking short test flights to nearby branches. Her two snazzy brothers favored the kamikaze approach; death-defying free falls landed them, tweeting and flailing, in the trumpet vine. Every time they made it back to the nest, a squawky fracas ensued that sounded to my fretful maternal ears like a warbled equivalent of ''What were you thinking?''"

A group of his neighbors, calling themselves Save Avalon Dunes, intends to take Mr. Rice to court to stop him from building a 14,881-square-foot summer house on the dunes around 52nd Street. Many of the opponents -- who have started a boycott of Utz snacks, the company that Mr. Rice is chief executive of -- have million-dollar homes themselves in this Cape May County resort."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"The first time it passed out its shiny little men in 1929, for the years 1927 and 1928, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had the good sense to recognize an essential and animating divide: the Oscar (as the statuettes came to be called) for ''outstanding picture'' went to a war movie called ''Wings,'' while the award for ''unique and artistic picture'' went to the sublime drama ''SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS.'' The two trophies were a tacit acknowledgment of the underlying tension between art and industry, a tension that now plays out each time another studio dependent steals critical thunder from its big studio brother and that will play out with increasing feverishness over the next five months. Directed by the German import F. W. Murnau, ''Sunrise'' stars George O'Brien and Janet Gaynor as a young country couple nearly undone by the temptations of the big city, and it remains a triumph of the classical studio system as well as one of its saddest cautionary tales. Brought to America by Fox to class up its act, Murnau quickly became a bridge between the cinema of the old world and the new. The writer was Austrian, the set designer German and one of the two cameramen, an Englishman in Hollywood, had worked with Murnau in Germany. During production, studio luminaries like Frank Borzage visited the vast set constructed on the Fox lot; John Ford declared ''Sunrise'' the greatest picture ever made and even went off to Germany later to shoot exteriors for one of his own films. But critical praise did not translate into box office success for what turned out to be the most expensive silent film made at Fox, which abandoned Murnau to cinema immortality. The academy, meanwhile, learned its lesson: never again did it give an award to a ''unique and artistic picture.'' Sunday at 6 p.m., Wednesday at 7:45 p.m., Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9480."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"Sometimes New York State's $100 billion-plus budget seems a little like Albany's own Treasure Island. Dig here, under a mountain of paper, or excavate there, behind big closed doors, and -- eureka -- suddenly there are hundreds of millions of extra dollars for state leaders to hand out like gold doubloons to the districts of favored legislators. Insiders have a lot of names for these secret pools of slush: member items, bullet aid (as in shooting a bullet of cash to somebody's favorite cause) and GLOP, short for General Legislative Operations Programs. After heavy pressure from journalists and a few politicians recently, Governor George Pataki and legislative leaders -- Joseph Bruno in the Senate and Sheldon Silver in the Assembly -- have begun providing a few details. We now know who got some of these items. What we don't know is who gave them. Data released by the Senate -- at www.senate.state.ny.us/sws/2006cpf/senatecpf06.pdf -- lists almost 3,500 grants. Without a Senate password, it is hard to sort the data by county or ZIP code to figure out which area got the most. ''It may not be wrapped up for you in a tidy little package,'' Mr. Bruno's spokesman said. ''But it's public.''"

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"It's fitting that ''THE CLEAN HOUSE'' and ''MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE'' start performances on Thursday, since each play, in very different ways, raises the same question: What took so long? ''My Name Is Rachel Corrie'' is a solo drama based on e-mail messages and journal entries written by Ms. Corrie, an American demonstrator for Palestinian rights who was killed in Gaza by an Israeli bulldozer in 2003. The play has been at the center of one of the most furious controversies in the theater in years, even though few people in New York have seen it. The brouhaha began earlier this year after the New York Theater Workshop announced that it was delaying the play. Critics cried censorship, while representatives from the theater said it needed more time to ''contextualize'' the play. When ''Rachel Corrie'' begins performances at the Minetta Lane, we can finally see what the fuss is about. Previews begin Thursday; runs Oct. 15 to Nov. 19, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 420-8000; $45 to $65. SARAH RUHL, a 32-year-old playwright, has been celebrated across the country, winning several prizes and receiving major productions at prominent regional theaters like the Arena Stage in Washington, the Goodman Theater in Chicago and the Berkeley Repertory Theater. But her plays have been notably absent from New York, until now. ''The Clean House,'' a fantastical romantic comedy, begins performances at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater on Thursday. The timing is impeccable, since the play, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer, arrives soon after Ms. Ruhl was awarded a MacArthur fellowship (popularly known as the ''genius grant''). That should draw even more attention to this long-awaited debut. Set in what the script refers to as a ''metaphysical Connecticut,'' ''The Clean House'' involves a doctor who hires a Brazilian maid with an odd professional quirk: she hates to clean. Previews begin Thursday, runs Oct. 30 to Dec. 17, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; $75 ($70 for previews)."

Cartoonists could not agree more, as you'll discover in ''MASTERS OF AMERICAN COMICS,'' a show of some 500 books, zines, strips and sketches by 15 artists, ranging from Winsor McCay (''Little Nemo in Slumberland'') and George Herriman (''Krazy Kat'') in the early 20th century to contemporary figures like Gary Panter and Chris Ware. The difference of course is that cartoonists do what all artists do: they see what's funny and awful before we do, then make us see it. Think of Mad magazine. Think of ''Maus.''

The Biedermeier period lasted in Northern Europe for a scant 15 years (1815-30), but its name became code for the charmless comfiness of the bourgeois culture.

And for something completely different, let me recommend the permanent collection display that just opened at the Fowler Museum at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Behind the News -- The claims by three former acquaintances kept alive questions about Mr. Allen's racial sensitivity that have dogged his campaign since the spring. Mr. Allen denied ever using racist language, but the accusations raised doubts among political analysts that he can hold off the Democratic challenger, Jim Webb. And the controversy seemed to quash any presidential aspirations for Mr. Allen. NEW YORK The News -- Federal prosecutors said they were investigating whether Jeanine F. Pirro, the Republican candidate for New York attorney general, illegally taped conversations of her husband. Behind the News -- Ms. Pirro acknowledged talking about taping her husband, who she thought was having an extramarital affair. She said she did nothing illegal, and accused the investigators of conducting a witch hunt. But party leaders were not rushing to her defense, and there were doubts whether her candidacy could survive this latest controversy.

Behind the News -- Mr. McGavick's unprovoked late-summer confessional, in which, among other things, he also admitted to lying to employees of his company about layoffs, was a calculated gamble that voters would appreciate his honesty. But polls since the revelations showed he was still struggling against the incumbent Democrat, Maria Cantwell.

In their rehearsal last month for the upcoming performance of ''Time In,'' an exploration of time spent behind bars, the performers spoke of waiting for the hours to pass, of how they came to be inmates and of how they supported one another."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I am a full-time wheelchair user because of polio and wanted all my fellow disabled travelers to be aware of the outstanding service offered by Qantas Airlines. They have, onboard all standard trans-Pacific flights, a full-size aisle chair and a bathroom to accommodate it, unless there is a last-minute change of aircraft. The Qantas staff was absolutely on top of my needs before I could anticipate them, and actually asked me if I needed to use the facilities on a regular basis. I must also add that as a first-time visitor to Australia, the onboard purser was there to inform me of procedures regarding the return of my motorized chair at Sydney Airport, and offered me tips on touring and accessibility in Sydney.

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"For many years now Paul Berman, a self-described ''literature-and-politics man,'' has rigorously examined the contradictions of ideological commitment, most recently in his books ''Terror and Liberalism'' and ''Power and the Idealists.'' Berman's own ideological path has taken some interesting turns. A participant in the Columbia University protests of the late 1960's, he later wrote skeptically about leftist governments in Latin America."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"JUST blocks from the campus of Yale, a group of women are also attending classes, but they are learning a basic survival skill: how to sew. The women compose a patchwork of lives shipwrecked by society, families or personal demons; they have ended up without steady homes, in shelters or doubled up with family. Some are fighting crack or alcohol. But they are bolstered by a three-year-old program called Village of Power and its lyrically titled offshoot, Growing Through Sewing."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"JOE TORRE was never the victim of his father's abuse, but growing up in a violent household still left a mark on him. Mr. Torre remembers the shouting and the screaming as his father tormented his mother, Margaret. He can remember standing in the kitchen, as his father -- a police officer -- escalated the terror by reaching into a drawer for his revolver. He recalls his older brothers and sisters trying to shield him, the youngest of five, from what was going on. Yet even into his mid-50's, Mr. Torre, the manager of the Yankees, who is now 66, hadn't connected his feelings of insecurity and anxiety to growing up in a violent home. It wasn't until he attended a weekend self-help retreat in 1995 with his wife, Ali, that he began to connect emotionally with his childhood."

She graduated from Fordham and received a master's degree in public administration from Baruch College."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Like Stanley Crouch in his review of Flores Forbes's memoir, ''Will You Die With Me?'' (Sept. 10), I welcome some truth-telling that corrects the bloated hero worship of the Black Panthers. Most of the revelations in the book were previously outlined in an article I wrote for New Times magazine 28 long years ago (''The Party's Over,'' May 1978), the culmination of an eight-month investigation by me and the reporter Paul Avery under the auspices of the Center for Investigative Reporting in San Francisco. After the piece appeared, Huey P. Newton and his attorney, Michael Kennedy, called a press conference announcing a $6 million lawsuit against me and New Times while parading around little Panther children with signs accusing me of taking away their breakfast program. The lawsuit was never filed. The hagiography of Newton actually increased after his death. Then, one by one, the top brass wrote their own versions of Panther history, now blaming everything bad on the dead Newton and his terrible cocaine habit. But that habit was in full force long before that, when I wrote my article, and so was the extortion, the fraud, the mud-holing draconian punishment for Panther rank and filers. Nothing seemed to dent the Panthers' good press during those years. It's encouraging to read of Forbes's escape from his former life and his obvious rehabilitation. But I was disappointed that Forbes didn't see fit to even mention murders carried out under Newton, including the time when Newton was a fugitive in Cuba. The murder of Betty Van Patter, the white bookkeeper for the Panthers who disappeared after she threatened to go public with illegalities she had uncovered in doing the books for the Panther bar, the Lamp Post, does not appear anywhere in Forbes's book. At the time Elaine Brown was running for an Oakland City Council seat, and Van Patter's going public could have sunk her campaign. Van Patter was last seen alive at the Lamp Post, where she'd been summoned. Her body was found 35 days later in the San Francisco Bay. Whatever Forbes may know about this and other murders, he has not chosen to share it with readers. Furthermore, it is with great skepticism that I regard Forbes's assertion that the idea for the (botched) assassination attempt on the witness in Newton's murder trial was Forbes's own idea. Throughout the book he details his absolute loyalty in a rigid top-down organization. He was the youngest of the squad of enforcers and the most disciplined. He is covering up in my opinion, and quite possibly it is to protect those who orchestrated it and are still very much alive. I did learn a few new things from Forbes's book: Mayor Lionel Wilson spared Forbes -- when Wilson was a judge -- on an early charge after Elaine Brown promised him full Panther support for his first mayoral run; and, far more surprising, Forbes writes that he considered the Oakland ''pigs'' (cops) to be downright decent compared to the police in Los Angeles. Who knew! Kate Coleman Berkeley, Calif."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"FOR the past five springs, a pair of Baltimore Orioles has returned to our yard to nest. This year I was worried. The last I had seen of the dazzling orange patriarch, he was bravely, desperately leading a screeching redtail hawk away from his brood. Then they all vanished. Thus when Daddy-O returned this spring, I rejoiced -- and followed the flash of wings to the hammocklike nest swinging high in our maple tree. The fledging of the ensuing baby orioles took place at a tender time in our human nest; our 16-year-old son, Sam, had gotten his driver's permit. It was a milestone I've dreaded since he began taking solid food. So it was only natural that I would do the sappy Mom thing and anthropomorphize the avian drama. I envied Mama Oriole her apparent sangfroid as the baby birds plunged, flapping, into the void. The female chick was cautious, taking short test flights to nearby branches. Her two snazzy brothers favored the kamikaze approach; death-defying free falls landed them, tweeting and flailing, in the trumpet vine. Every time they made it back to the nest, a squawky fracas ensued that sounded to my fretful maternal ears like a warbled equivalent of ''What were you thinking?''"

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"LANIGAN--Thomas L. A leading editor in chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology died on Sunday, September 24, 2006 in Passaic, New Jersey. He was the founder of the Science, Technology and Medicine publisher The Humana Press, Inc. Born on August 23, 1938, in Oswego, New York, Mr. Lanigan earned a bachelor'S degree in chemistry from Le Moyne College, Syracuse, New York, and a master's degree in physical chemistry from St. John's University. While working on his PhD he entered scientific publishing as an editor, first at Academic Press, then at Plenum Press in New York City. Mr. Lanigan founded Humana Press in 1977 and built it into a leading publisher of cutting-edge research in molecular biology and molecular medicine, cancer research, heart disease, neuroscience, and neurology, a list of over a thousand titles and twentyfour journals, serving a wide spectrum of the scientific and medical research communities. Humana Press was recently acquired by Springer Science and Business Media, which will maintain the Humana imprint. Humana Press also published belles lettres, a lifelong passion of Mr. Lanigan, including novels by Demetrio Aguilera-Malta, the celebrated magic realist of Ecuador, and the autobiography of Vincent Zigas, an early researcher in prion disease. Although his main focus for the past thirty years has been to build Humana Press, Mr. Lanigan indulged his passion for the theater, music, and visual arts, and continued to write poetry. He was an avid collector of contemporary paintings and graphics. He was a philanthropist and, with his wife, endowed an interdisciplinary chair at Le Moyne College to promote the study science, medicine, and ethics, and their interactions. Mr. Lanigan is survived by his wife of 41 years, Julia Bartko Lanigan, who served as Humana Press's vice president of operations from 1991 to 2006 and by their son Thomas B. Lanigan of Weston, Florida, who was marketing director of Humana from 1993 to 2006. Also surviving are his mother, Mary Ellen Lanigan of Oswego, and his brothers and sisters, James of Manchester, NH; Mary of Syracuse; Charles and Frances of Oswego; Terance, of Phoenix, Arizona; Elizabeth of Rochester, NY; and Patrick of Watertown, NY."

2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"THE photo album on the coffee table in this toy-strewn house, a souvenir of a summer wedding that kicked off what should have been a festive Fourth of July weekend in 2005, is a tear-jerker, and for all the wrong reasons. To leaf through it is to take a sentimental journey with the cruelest ending imaginable. The album is bound in white satin, but the name stenciled in gold on its cover is not that of the bride, nor does it focus on the bride and groom. Instead, it chronicles an extroverted 7-year-old flower girl in an ivory party dress with a pink sash the color of the rose petals she tossed on the beach the day her aunt was married, a day that ended with the decapitation of the flower girl, Katie Flynn, in a grisly crash that the police say was caused by a drunken driver in a pickup truck careering north in the Meadowbrook Parkway's southbound lanes."

Her company, CONTRE JOUR makes its American debut in a full evening of Ms. Duboc's work at the French Institute Alliance Française. The program includes an extract from her ''Trois boléros,'' and the 2003 ''trio,'' and -- most intriguingly -- offers a new solo performed by the 65-year-old Ms. Duboc. Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160; $25. The 70th birthday of the composer STEVE REICH is being celebrated all over town, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music has a particularly inviting offering: a double bill, set to Mr. Reich's music, of ANNE TERESA DE KEERSMAEKER's rigorously austere duo ''Fase'' and AKRAM KHAN's ''Variations for Vibes, Pianos and Strings.'' Mr. Khan, known for his blend of Indian Kathak and contemporary dance technique, will appear alongside two dancers, the South Korean Young Jin Kim and the South African Gregory Maqoma, who should bring their own styles to the mix. Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m., 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100 or bam.org; $20 to $55."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,THIS will not be the kind of authoritative parenting column that we all need. It will not be a parenting column like this:
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''On the Ocean, a Trump Deal,'' by Robin Finn (The Island column, Sept. 24):"
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"This fall, designers are using ruffles as flourishes in varied and lovely ways. Whether in a classic jabot at the throat of a blouse, in micro-rows at the cuff of a sleeve or in one striking ripple down the front of a coat, ruffles are no longer party-girl tacky but are, by turns, racy, elegant, flirtatious and anything but predictable. Fancy that. 1. A single gorgeous ruffle tumbles down the front of Etro's striking coat like an endless length of ribbon candy ($2,230 at Saks Fifth Avenue stores). 2. A leopard-print Roberto Cavalli blouse has an unconstructed neckline and gracefully drapes at the shoulders and the sleeves ($1,425 at Roberto Cavalli boutiques). 3. Ruffles go bohemian on Be&D's suede handbags with beaded drawstrings and buckle shoulder straps (in red and chocolate, $1,280 at Saks Fifth Avenue stores). Serious handiwork in the form of four rows of suede ruffles adorns Bergdorf Goodman's rich brown nappa leather gloves ($195 at Bergdorf Goodman). 4. A sheer pink silk blouse with ruffles and a detachable ascot by Juicy Couture conjures up visions of a modern-day Marian the Librarian ($158 at Saks Fifth Avenue). The sharp tailoring of a Robert Rodriguez shirt is offset by micro-ruffles at the cuffs ($275 at www.eLuxury.com). 5. Nanette Lepore's High Society top has three tiers of frills and comes in red or cream silk (top, $195; pinstripe vest dress, $325, at Nanette Lepore in New York, 212-219-8265). 6. A felted striped cardigan by Marc by Marc Jacobs has an oversize offhand ruffle down one side ($248 at www.shopbop.com). Tory Burch's navy wool sweater gets an extra infusion of chic from print frills at collar and cuffs ($295 at www.toryburch.com). 7. A stretchy copper-hued knit dress by Hengst is a sexy standout with a yoke framed with a single ruffle ($418 at Searle stores)."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Sol Wachtler's personal account of solitary confinement in a ''special housing unit'' (''A Cell of One's Own,'' Op-Ed, Sept. 24) graphically describes the sad, neglectful and dangerous handling of our mentally ill offenders in the New York State prison system. It is shameful that Governor Pataki vetoed a bill that would have prevented such treatment."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"In New Jersey, the most recent statewide test results showed an increase over last year in the number of schools that improved their overall performance under the requirements of the federal No Child Left Behind law. But dozens of schools, unable to improve their test scores over several years, face the prospect of reorganization, state education officials said. A quarter of New Jersey's schools failed to meet the federal law's requirements this year, compared with a third of the state's schools in 2005, according to a preliminary report released by the state Department of Education in August. Under the law, students undergo statewide testing in math, reading and writing to determine whether a school meets the state's standards for academic performance."
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"PRESIDENT PERVEZ MUSHARRAF of Pakistan was in Washington, New York, and on TV screens across the United States last week to promote his country's efforts to counter Al Qaeda, but that was not all. He was also promoting his new autobiography ''In the Line of Fire: A Memoir.'' Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York Tuesday, the general repeatedly made statements that his critics, and some experts, questioned. Here are some of his remarks as transcribed by the Federal News Service, with responses from United Nations, Pakistani and United States officials. Economic Growth ''Today, our G.D.P. growth over the last four years is 7 percent. Our per capita income has more than doubled. Our G.D.P. has doubled.''"
2006-10-01T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: The answer to the question in your article (The Hunt, ''When Modern is Out of Fashion,'' Sept. 24) about why there is so much midcentury modern in the West and so little on the East Coast is this: A vast majority of modern homes in North America were built after World War II from 1945 to 1970. The West experienced a housing boom during this period caused by a confluence of the end of the war, the G.I. Bill of Rights, available space and the migration of people West. All of this intersected with the modern aesthetic that had taken root right before the war. Richard Corff Seattle The writer is the founder of 360degrees Modern, a real estate brokerage company."

Weprin of Queens urged the State Senate yesterday to act on a bill that would make it easier for adult children to receive coverage under their parents’ health insurance plans. Current law allows parents to continue coverage of a dependent beyond age 19, so long as the child is attending college, until age 23. The bill, sponsored by Mr. Grannis and passed by the Assembly in June, would raise the age limit for coverage to 25 and remove the requirement that the child be a student. In June, the Senate passed a separate measure, sponsored by Senator William J. Larkin Jr., an Orange County Republican, that would allow, but not require, insurance companies to continue coverage of adult children up to age 25."

Moylan, the cemetery’s president. The property, established in 1838, “is outstanding for its cohesive, picturesque character, integrated Gothic Revival architecture, and high integrity,” said the secretary of the interior, Dirk Kempthorne. Nearly 600,000 people have been buried at Green-Wood, an active cemetery that is the resting place of Boss Tweed, Leonard Bernstein and the original Brooks Brothers. Mr. Moylan said the designation could be useful in efforts to preserve the view, which has been threatened by high-rise development, of the Statue of Liberty from the cemetery’s hilltop statue of Minerva. “We can now make the case,” Mr. Moylan said, “that the view is landmark to landmark.”."

2006-10-02T00:00:00Z,"DURANT--Helen von Dongen, Bratteboro, VT--Helen von Dongen Durant, 97, a resident at Hilltop House in Brattleboro since 2002, died Thursday night, September 28, 2006 at the Thompson House Nursing Home on Maple Street, following a period of declining health. Mrs. Durant was born in Amsterdam, The Netherlands on January 5, 1909, the daughter of Andreas Johannes and Louise Marie Constance (Mathieu) van Dongen. She was educated in Paris, Berlin, Vienna and London and began her professional career as a film maker around 1927. She was the youngest member of a group of students, avant-guard artists and professionals in Amsterdam who founded FILM LIGA in protest against the low quality of the imported commercial films then being shown in the cinemas of Europe. Extensive experimentation took place not only to improve the artisitc quality of films but also to add sound and color to the hitherto silent films. During the 1930's she attended the newly developed Western Electric sound recording system at Tobis Films Sonores in Paris and the RCA System at UFA Film Studios in Berlin. Her accrued technical knowledge, artistic application and a facility with foreign languages took her to many of the countries of Europe. Among her early major productions was the filming of the construction of the powerful Dutch sea-like dike which would seperate the Zuiderzee from the North Sea, thereby creating more new dry land for the building of housing. From 1934-1936 she lectured and taught film editing and the new science of adding speech and sound to the hitherto silent films, at the Academy of Cinematography in Moscow. She also collaborated at the film productions of such renowned Russian film producers and directors as Pudowkin, Eisenstein and Wertow. In 1936 she received an invitation to lead an experimental film project for Rockefeller Foundation in New York for their Commission on Human Relations. She also produced and edited Joris Ivens famous film, The ''Spanish Earth,'' with commentary by Ernest Hemingway. In 1939 she directed an experiment in Technicolor with miniature puppets-in stop-action, for the Combined Petroleum Industry, shown at the Worlds fair in New York City. During the war years, 1941-1945 she produced films both independently as well as for the U.S. Signal Corp. in Holywood and for the office of War Information in New York. From 1945-1946 she was appointed Deputy Film Commissioner for the Netherlands East Indies, in charge of the outfitting of modern studios and labratories, as well as educational film production. After one year this project was abandoned because the former East Indies colonies declared themselves independent from the motherland, Holland. Upon her return from one year of research in Europe, she produced and directed the film, ''Of Human Rights'', for the United Nations. From 1946-1948 she produced and retained the editorial supervision of Robert Flaherty's film, ''Louisiana Story.'' Looking forward to a more quiet and private life she and her husband, Kenneth Durant, settled on their farm in Jamaica, Vermont. During the following 15 years both collaborated on an extensive study of the origin and evolution of the Adirondack guide-boat, a handmade craft without which travel through the Adirondack wilderness in the early years was impossible. When Kenneth Durant died in the fall of 1972, Helen continued this study and wrote the book, ''The Adirondack Guide Boat,'' published by the Adirondack Museum at Blue Mountain Lake, New York, in 1980 and since reprinted in 1986 and 1990. In 1988 she became a resident of Brattleboro, Vermont and became a volunteer teacher of creative writing for three years at Saint Michael's School for grades 3,4, and 5. She also volunteered at Bridget's Kitchen, operated by Saint Michael's Parish, the former Linden Lodge Nursing Home as well as at the Brattleboro Museum and Art Center. Her considerable gift of fine art books to the museum now forms the nucleus of the Mrs. Kenneth Durant Art Library. Mrs. Durant was a communicant of Saint Michael's Roman Catholic Church in Brattleboro. Survivors include one nephew, Fred Durant III, and his daughter Pixie Gable and her husband Peter all of Raleigh, N.C., half sister; Nettie Hendricks and husband Herman of The Netherlands. The Liturgy of Christian Burial will be celebrated Tuesday at 11:00 A.M. at Saint Michael's Church on Walnut Street. Committal Rites and burial wil follow in the Durant lot in Saint Michael's parish cemetery. Ther are no calling hours. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions in Mrs. Durant's name may be made to; Hilltop House 65 Harris Ave., Brattleboro, VT. 05301, Mrs. Durant's home for the past four and a half years or to : Grace Cottage Hospital Foundation, P.O.

2006-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Evanescence ''The Open Door'' (Wind-Up/Sony BMG) In 2003 Evanescence struck it huge with ''Fallen.'' That album balanced Amy Lee's airy voice with a barrage of heavy guitars; it was bright enough to win over fans of Avril Lavigne and dark enough to win over fans of European goth-rock bands like HIM and Lacuna Coil. ''Fallen'' eventually became one of this decade's biggest hits: it has sold more 6.5 million copies in America, and nearly 14 million worldwide. Look in the liner notes for ''The Open Door,'' and you'll see that Amy Lee is about the only familiar name. Ben Moody, the guitarist who helped write much of ''Fallen,'' quit less than a year after that CD was released; since then he has collaborated with Kelly Clarkson and, as it happens, Ms. Lavigne. No surprise, then, that the Moody-free Evanescence sounds gloomier and thornier than the old one. Ms. Lee is finally free to be as bombastic as she wants to be."

A Las Vegas-bred Mormon, he sang like a British fop, dressed like a dissolute lounge lizard and condemned drinking, drugs and fornication through perfectly glossed lips. When he trashed his peers and equated the Killers with greats like David Bowie, it seemed like media-baiting shtick: synth-pop pro-wrestling. Unfortunately he was serious. He has become a Wild West bard, the kind who wears a string tie and sings, ''Godspeed you boy, this river is wild.''

2006-10-03T00:00:00Z,"Yankees (97-65) vs. Detroit (95-67) Does good pitching always stop good hitting? This series should help to answer that question, pitting the majors' top pitching staff (the Tigers) against the majors' most productive offense (the Yankees). Detroit did not impress the Yankees this season, losing five of seven meetings between the teams. PITCHING YANKEES -- Unless his blisters open, the Game 1 starter Chien-Ming Wang should be fine. Mike Mussina, who will start Game 2, pitched a complete-game shutout against Detroit on May 31. Randy Johnson's back is a critical issue for Game 3. Mariano Rivera says his arm can handle the rigors of October, but Kyle Farnsworth has an awful playoff past. TIGERS -- The Tigers had the majors' best earned run average, at 3.84. The setup man Joel Zumaya is far more intimidating than closer Todd Jones, but each had an E.R.A. of 1.80 after the All-Star Game break. The only starter with postseason experience is Kenny Rogers. HITTING YANKEES -- The Yankees led the majors in runs, and their lineup is so deep that Joe Torre may never need a pinch-hitter. Johnny Damon and Bobby Abreu make the Yankees faster on the bases, more patient at the plate and more left-handed than in past Octobers. Hideki Matsui and Gary Sheffield have regained their timing, and Robinson Canó has been on a tear for eight weeks. TIGERS -- Detroit has a curious offensive formula, ranking second in the league in strikeouts with the second-fewest walks. In seven games against the Yankees, the Tigers hit .205 and averaged 3.3 runs a game. Their two victories came when Mariano Rivera was unavailable. Craig Monroe homered to beat Scott Proctor in August, but he has batted .181 since. FIELDING YANKEES -- The Tigers will challenge the below-average arms of Hideki Matsui in left field and Johnny Damon in center. Gary Sheffield has less than two weeks of experience at first base, and third baseman Alex Rodriguez matched a career high with 24 errors. Look for left fielder Melky Cabrera and first baseman Andy Phillips to be late-inning defensive replacements. TIGERS -- Catcher Iván Rodríguez can shut down any running game, but the Tigers have no outfielders who throw especially well. Plácido Polanco is a solid defender at second. Although third baseman Brandon Inge can make spectacular plays, he is also prone to wild throws. Carlos Guillén led A.L. shortstops in errors, with 28. X-FACTOR YANKEES -- So much has changed for Alex Rodriguez since he dominated the 2004 division series. There may be no player in the postseason with more pressure on him, and no player with more motivation to silence his doubters. He must remember how to harness his immense talent when it matters most. TIGERS -- The Tigers lost their last five games, giving away a division title that was in their grasp nearly all season. Was their slump meaningless, or an omen? Manager Jim Leyland, who led the wild-card Florida Marlins to a championship in 1997, will try to take the same route again. His players believe in him.

CBS held steady all night, starting at 7 with a much-publicized Mike Wallace ''60 Minutes'' interview with Bob Woodward (17.5 million). CBS's ''Amazing Race 10'' (13.3 million) improved on its week-ago performance at 8, while ''Cold Case'' (13 million) and ''Without a Trace'' (14.9 million) were off from their premieres but solid. NBC's live broadcast of the Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Bears game averaged 16.9 million viewers for the night, in time-zone adjusted estimates.

2006-10-03T00:00:00Z,"The Museum of Modern Art announced yesterday that it had created a new curatorial department to focus exclusively on the growing number of contemporary artworks that use sound and moving images in gallery installations. The media department, once part of the department of film and media, will deal with works that use a wide range of modern technology, from video and digital imagery to Internet-based art and sound-only pieces, said Klaus Biesenbach, who was named chief curator of the new department. Mr. Biesenbach, right, who has been a MoMA curator since 2004 and the chief curator of P.S. 1, the museum's Queens affiliate, since 2002, said that works relying on media techniques and ideas of conveying motion and time had become much more prominent over the last two decades at international art fairs and exhibitions. ''And it's even more visible now,'' he said. ''I think artistic practice is evolving, and so museums are evolving as well.'' The creation of the new department brings the number of curatorial departments at the museum to seven.

Democrats suddenly have a real chance of capturing Mr. Foley's seat in South Florida. The broader questions are whether the Foley case feeds the sour political mood -- the approval ratings for Congress are already among the lowest in a decade -- and whether it bolsters the Democrats' assertions that Republicans are incompetent and corrupt, and have been in power too long. The Foley news broke just after a book by Bob Woodward, ''State of Denial,'' focused new attention on President Bush's handling of the Iraq war, further distracting attention from the Republican security message when many of the party's candidates are struggling to gain an edge."

Fast Relief Four of the five rookie leaders in strikeouts by a relief pitcher are in the playoffs. Their innings pitched and strikeout totals: Speed to Burn JosÉ Reyes of the Mets led the majors in triples with 17 and stolen bases with 64. He almost out-tripled the Yankees, who hit 21 as a team. He also stole more bases than the Athletics (61), Tigers (60) and Cardinals (59).

Costing $12,000 to $18,000, the device automatically positions itself on stairs or steep ramps -- situations that can be difficult for an amputee. In initial fitting, a ''gait profile'' is created by having the wearer take 15 consecutive steps on level ground. The foot can be worn with or without shoes. FRANK O'CONNELL Adapting to its environment 1. Accelerometers sample the foot's position more than 1,000 times a second. A change in the gait signals that the person may no longer be on a level surface. 2. A motor drive pivots the heel up and down. 3. A sensor in the joint measures the foot's angle, ensuring that the foot is correctly positioned for the next step. Automated advantage Unlike previous artificial feet, the Proprio flexes automatically to the proper position, allowing for more natural walking. Different modes for special situations STAIR MODE Goes into action when the sensors detect two stairs in succession. It rotates the ankle to accommodate steps. RELAX MODE Allows wearer to sit more naturally by lowering toe toward the floor. CHAIR EXIT MODE By tapping the heel in relax mode, wearer flexes ankle forward so the foot can be pulled back. The heel provides shock absorption and allows a more natural walking motion. Its height can be adjusted up to 2 inches via a keypad to accommodate different shoe styles. Developments in prosthetic feet WOODEN LEG 1800's Peg leg for above-theknee amputees. SACH FOOT 1950's Solid ankle, cushion heel. Durable, inexpensive and lightweight.

2006-10-03T00:00:00Z,"San Diego (88-74) vs. St. Louis (83-78) A year ago, the Padres went to the playoffs with a team that finished two games over .500, and they were promptly swept by the Cardinals. This season, the Padres are significantly better built for postseason success. The Cardinals do not seem as balanced as they were the past two seasons. PITCHING PADRES -- San Diego has two starters in their prime (Jake Peavy and Chris Young) and two in their twilight (David Wells and Woody Williams). No team in the National League boasts a deeper or healthier rotation. San Diego's ultimate strength remains its bullpen. The bridge from Cla Meredith to Scott Linebrink to Trevor Hoffman took the Padres from summer to fall. CARDINALS -- Jeff Suppan and Jeff Weaver need to be effective behind Chris Carpenter. With Jason Isringhausen (left hip surgery) out for the season, the closer's role falls to the rookie Adam Wainwright, who had two key saves in the final five days. HITTING PADRES -- It is hard to believe that a lineup featuring Geoff Blum and Russell Branyan is seriously entertaining thoughts of playoff advancement. The Padres do not have any sluggers who inspire much fear, or even attention. No one on the team has more than 24 home runs or 83 runs batted in. Perhaps the most significant threat has been Dave Roberts, the leadoff hitter. When Roberts reaches base -- a fairly common occurrence -- the Padres are able to drive him in with Brian Giles, Adrian Gonzalez, Mike Piazza and Mike Cameron. CARDINALS -- Jim Edmonds returned from postconcussion syndrome last week, but his role could be limited. He has a sore left foot, and Manager Tony La Russa will not use him against left-handed pitchers. FIELDING PADRES -- If Khalil Greene is able to come back from a finger injury, the Padres will show off a double-play combination as smooth as any in the league. With Greene at shortstop, Josh Barfield at second and Mike Cameron in center, the Padres' only problem up the middle is catcher Mike Piazza, always a target for opposing base-stealers. CARDINALS -- The outfield is only decent without Jim Edmonds; the same for the infield without David Eckstein. So Taguchi and Juan Encarnación played center field in the last two regular-season games, and each was a step down from even a hobbled Edmonds. Catcher Yadier Molina threw out 42 percent of runners trying to steal against him. X-FACTOR PADRES -- Low-scoring games tend to favor the Padres, and at Petco Park low-scoring games are nearly a sure thing. Petco is a pitchers paradise, and the Padres are built around their pitchers. San Diego hitters used to be frustrated by their home field, but they have learned to manufacture runs. CARDINALS -- Saving the team's season, Scott Spiezio hit a pinch-hit three-run triple in Saturday's 3-2 victory over Milwaukee. More than two-thirds of his 52 R.B.I. came with two outs. Spiezio is no stranger to postseason heroics. He had 19 R.B.I. for the Angels in the 2002 playoffs. LEE JENKINS and PAT BORZI 1. Today at San Diego 4:09 p.m. ESPN ST. L. Carpenter (15-8) S.D.

2006-10-03T00:00:00Z,"President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney probably do not watch many PBS ''Frontline'' documentaries about Iraq and Afghanistan, and for the sake of their blood pressure, it's probably just as well. Nothing could be more maddening that the slow, methodical drip, drip, drip of unflattering image and fact -- especially when framed by the grave, reproachful voice-over of Will Lyman, a longtime narrator on ''Frontline.'' ''Return of the Taliban,'' on PBS tonight, examines why the United States appears to be losing ground against Al Qaeda and Taliban forces in Afghanistan. It gives two stark reasons: the Jihadists' single-minded determination to expel foreign troops and Pakistan's ambivalence about rooting out Taliban strongholds along its border."

2006-10-03T00:00:00Z,"Minnesota (96-66) vs. Oakland (93-69) After losing their young star, the left-hander Francisco Liriano, to an elbow injury, the Twins patched together a pitching rotation behind Johan Santana, won 96 games and overtook Detroit for the division title on the final day of the season. The A's thrived in the second half (48-26, best record in baseball). PITCHING TWINS -- The Twins will be in trouble if Johan Santana is their only effective starter. Boof Bonser was great in September (4-1, 2.63 earned run average in six starts), but he is a rookie. Brad Radke pitched all season with a torn labrum, and Carlos Silva has been inconsistent. Minnesota's strength is its bullpen, anchored by Joe Nathan, who compiled 36 saves in 38 chances with a 1.58 E.R.A. ATHLETICS -- The left-hander Barry Zito is 3-2 with a 2.76 E.R.A. in postseason games, but he has never started a Game 1. Rich Harden, back after missing most of the season with back and elbow problems, gave Oakland a late-season boost. HITTING TWINS -- The batting champion Joe Mauer and the M.V.P. candidate Justin Morneau get most of the attention, but Michael Cuddyer (24 homers, 109 runs batted in) finally blossomed into the cleanup hitter the Twins had sought for more than a decade. The so-called Little Piranhas -- Nick Punto, Jason Bartlett and Jason Tyner -- make this team go. ATHLETICS -- The A's finished near the bottom of the league in every major hitting category, and batted .243 with runners in scoring position. Frank Thomas's comeback-player-of-the-year season included a big second half (20 homers, 68 R.B.I. in 72 games) with no letup. He had 11 homers and 34 R.B.I. from Sept. 1 on. Shortstop Bobby Crosby (back problems) is not expected to play in this series. FIELDING TWINS -- Nick Punto, a utility infielder, provided Gold Glove-caliber defense at third base in the second half of the season, and shortstop Jason Bartlett and second baseman Luis Castillo were solid. Manager Ron Gardenhire says this infield may be almost as airtight as the 2002 unit, which featured the Gold Glove first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz. Center fielder Torii Hunter appears close to full speed after more than a year of foot and ankle problems. ATHLETICS -- This has been a bright spot. Marco Scutaro filled in well for shortstop Bobby Crosby, second baseman Mark Ellis made two errors all season, and the outfield of Milton Bradley, Mark Kotsay and Jay Payton covers a lot of ground. X-FACTOR TWINS -- The Metrodome crowd does not have the effect it once did; the Twins have lost five straight home playoff games since 2002, the last four to the Yankees. Closer Joe Nathan's phenomenal season has received little national attention. In a short series, when runs may be scarce, an effective Nathan could be the difference. ATHLETICS -- Rich Harden, though roughed up by the Angels on Sunday (6 runs in three and two-thirds innings), had allowed only one run and struck out 12 in eight innings over his two previous starts since returning from a strained elbow. One well-pitched game by Harden could swing the series. PAT BORZI 1. Today at Minnesota 1:09 p.m. ESPN OAK Zito (16-10) MINN Santana (19-6) 2.

2006-10-03T00:00:00Z,"Mets (97-65) vs. Dodgers (88-74) The Mets took the lead in the National League East on April 6 and never looked back. This is their first playoff appearance since 2000, when they reached the World Series. The Dodgers overturned their opening-day bullpen and three-fifths of their rotation and managed to win the wild card. PITCHING METS -- Without the injured Pedro Martínez, the Mets will send out two playoff-tested starters for Games 1 and 2. Orlando Hernández is 9-3 with a 2.55 earned run average in 19 postseason appearances, and the 290-game winner Tom Glavine, the Game 2 starter, has made 32 career postseason starts. After that it can get dicey. DODGERS -- Derek Lowe and Greg Maddux are perhaps the most formidable duo in the N.L. The rookie Hong-Chih Kuo, a left-hander, pitched six shutout innings against the Mets last month. Brad Penny has been hampered by back problems. Closer Takashi Saito is 3-0 with a 1.30 E.R.A. since taking over the role in August. HITTING METS -- A dynamic combination of speed and power anchors the most complete lineup in the N.L. Three players -- David Wright, Carlos Beltrán and Carlos Delgado -- had 114 or more runs batted in this season, and seven reached double digits in home runs. The speedy leadoff batter José Reyes is disruptive when he gets on base. DODGERS -- The Dodgers are more prone to tack on hit after hit and run other teams ragged than play for a three-run home run. Nomar Garciaparra and J. D. Drew share the team lead with 20 homers, but they are two of the seven starters who are batting higher than .280. Rafael Furcal has the second-highest on-base percentage among regular leadoff hitters and ranks among the league leaders in runs and stolen bases. FIELDING METS -- The team tied a franchise record this season by going 12 consecutive games without an error. The defense is solid over all, though not exceptional. Carlos Beltrán has 13 assists, tops among center fielders. Cliff Floyd is hindered by soreness in his left Achilles' tendon and has narrow range in left field. DODGERS -- Defense is the Dodgers' biggest weakness. Their 115 errors this season are the most among playoff teams. Rafael Furcal's rifle arm allows him to make plays other shortstops cannot, but he is not always on target. He committed 27 errors this season, the third-highest total in baseball. At first base, Nomar Garciaparra has made a seamless transition, boasting a .996 fielding percentage. X-FACTOR METS -- Of the Mets' projected starters, four -- José Valentín, Cliff Floyd, Carlos Beltrán and Shawn Green -- have playoff experience. Carlos Delgado and Paul Lo Duca, both 34 years old, are making it for the first time. They will be guided by a manager, Willie Randolph, who will begin his 18th postseason. DODGERS -- The Dodgers are the streakiest team in the playoffs. After going 48-42 in the first half, they lost 13 of 14 games after the All-Star Game break. Then they reeled off an 11-game winning streak and 17 victories in 18 games. They enter the playoffs having swept consecutive road series in Colorado and San Francisco. BEN SHPIGEL 1.

About 70 of India's most successful writers, including Amitav Ghosh, left, and Kiran Desai, are scheduled to present their work at the five-day event, which is expected to draw nearly 300,000 visitors to see some 7,000 exhibitors from 111 countries, Agence France-Presse reported. This year's event will also focus on the boom in electronic publishing, and Google Inc. is expected to be in the spotlight, since its efforts to make extracts of every book printed available online have prompted concerns with authors and publishers over copyright. Up All Night in Toronto Adventurous people of Toronto -- more than 400,000 of them -- stayed up and out on Saturday night and into Sunday morning at their first Nuit Blanche festival, which transformed the city into an art gallery, The Globe and Mail of Toronto reported. For 12 hours, beginning at 7:01 p.m. on Saturday, visitors attended more than 130 exhibits in galleries, churches and parks in what Mayor David Miller called ''an extraordinary night for the city.'' Toronto adopted the idea from Paris, where the first Nuit Blanche was held in October 2002. The event has since spread to Rome; Madrid; Naples, Italy; and Riga, Latvia. This year's Parisian version starts at sundown on Oct. 7. Woes for George Michael The British singer George Michael was arrested over the weekend when London police found him slumped over the wheel of his car and in possession of cannabis, Reuters reported. ''At about 3.22 a.m. on Sunday morning officers were informed of a stationary vehicle with a driver inside causing an obstruction,'' a police spokesman said. Mr. Michael, 43, was arrested in February this year in a scenario that was almost exactly the same as last weekend's. The singer's partner, Kenny Goss, told reporters Sunday night that Mr. Michael had no comment about the arrest. ''He's fine and I've got him a McDonald's,'' Mr. Goss said. Plácido Domingo in Print: Learn From a Master In ''The Joy of Opera,'' scheduled for publication in 2009, the renowned tenor Plácido Domingo, below, will offer insights into masterpieces and how opera works -- and can be enjoyed -- on both sides of the curtain, Reuters reported. ''Opera for so many people remains a mystery, a curious and strange art form, when it really should be much more part of our everyday lives,'' Mr. Domingo writes in the book, according to the publisher W. W. Norton, which has acquired the worldwide rights. Mr. Domingo, 65, is the general director of both the Los Angeles Opera and the Washington National Opera and continues to perform and conduct. Footnotes Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman are both slated to direct productions for the Sydney Theater Company in Australia in 2007.

The Very End The results of a survey released yesterday indicate that James Blunt's ''Goodbye My Lover'' is the song most requested at British funerals and remembrance services, with Robbie Williams's ''Angels'' coming in second. The survey, sponsored by The Bereavement Register, which removes from databases the names and addresses of people who have died, found that 51 percent of respondents ask for a specific song to be played at their funeral, and that 79 percent have talked with family and friends about possible choices. Some choices were ambiguous, though. Is it the deceased or someone left behind whom we are to imagine singing the words of the No. 9 song, Police's ''Every Breath You Take''? It includes the lyrics ''Every move you make/Every step you take/I'll be watching you.''"
