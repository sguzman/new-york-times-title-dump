2014-03-26T00:00:00Z,"CUNNIFF--Richard Trolan, died of complications from congestive heart failure on March 23, 2014, at his home in Lloyd Harbor, NY. He was 91. Rick was born on January 20, 1923, in the Bronx, New York, the son of Frank George and Florence Trolan Cunniff. He graduated from South Side High School in Rockville Centre, NY in 1941 and enrolled in Colgate University just in time for America's entry into World War II. As a proud part of the Navy's V-12 program at Colgate, he completed his officer training and was posted to Pearl Harbor in 1944 to serve aboard LCI(G)451, one of the Navy's Landing Craft Infantry (Gunnery) ships. These vessels played a key role in protecting the first waves of amphibious troops from shore-based enemy fire. Rick served in several combat operations including the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the landings at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, and Okinawa. In 1946 he was released from active duty as a Lieutenant (jg). Rick entered Harvard Business School in 1948, and in June 1949 he married Marilyn P. Feld (also of Rockville Centre). He and Marilyn were anticipating the celebration of their 65th wedding anniversary this coming June. Rick received his MBA in 1950 and began his career working for investment firms including Kidder, Peabody; Ferris & Co.; Sterling, Grace & Co.; Keswick Corp.; MacKay-Shields; and Andresen & Co. In 1969, Rick joined with William J. Ruane to found the investment firm of Ruane, Cunniff & Stires (Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb today), and they created the Sequoia Fund the following year. In his heart, Rick always considered himself a securities analyst. Passionate about the importance of rigorous research, Rick and the firm achieved a well-earned reputation for integrity, and in the years since its founding the firm has been able to achieve one of the most outstanding long-term performance records in the mutual fund industry. He was especially proud that his daughter Carley joined Ruane Cunniff & Goldfarb in 1989 and went on to serve as Executive Vice President and a Director of both RCG and the Sequoia Fund. She was an important part of the firm's growth until her illness in 2001. Rick was a corporate director of Sturm, Ruger & Co. from 1986 to 2007 and a Trustee Emeritus of Colgate University, to which he devoted boundless energy and generosity throughout his lifetime. Rick's other interests included sailing, golf, and politics (even at 91, he was still reading four newspapers every morning). Known for his wonderful sense of humor and willingness to help others in both professional and personal matters, Rick will be deeply missed by many. He is survived by his wife Marilyn; his childen Richard Cunniff Jr., Peter Cunniff (Felicia), Hilary Cunniff, and Jeanne Foussard (Phillip); grandchildren Daniel and Claire Foussard, Lily Cunniff and Gareth Cunniff; and son-in-law Andy Baxter. He was preceded in death by his daughter Carley and brother Frank. A memorial program will be held at The University Club, 1 W. 54th St., NYC on April 29 at 11:00am. Contributions in Rick's memory may be made to the Visiting Nurse Service & Hospice of Suffolk (505 Main Street, Northport, NY 11768) or to Colgate University (13 Oak Drive, Hamilton, NY 13346)."

This certification enabled DSFHS to continue the work that Mother Mary Walsh and the Dominican Sisters of the Sick Poor had begun in the 1870's -- providing compassionate health care to all those in need. Sister Virginia's pioneering work with the then small agency helped set the foundation for the kind of quality care that DSFHS delivers today to patients and clients throughout the New York Metropolitan Area.

2014-03-26T00:00:00Z,"CUNNIFF--Richard Trolan. Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb mourns the passing of our co-founder and longtime vice chairman, Richard T. Cunniff, at the age of 91. Rick was the consummate stock analyst, a true gentleman and a proud veteran of World War II. Rick's life was profoundly affected by his military service. As a 21-year old Ensign and later Lieutenant (jg) on an amphibious ship, he participated in some of the most intense naval battles of the war, including Leyte Gulf in October 1944. His ship made landings at Lingayen Gulf and Luzon in the Philippines and Okinawa in 1945. In later years, Rick would occasionally remark that no stock market disturbance could compare to being 21 years old on the deck of a small vessel in the Pacific, surrounded by enemy ships and kamikaze planes, taking fire. Rick completed his degree at Colgate in 1945 and graduated from Harvard Business School in 1950. Upon graduation from Harvard, Rick joined Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York City, where he met his future business partner William J. Ruane. Rick advanced through a series of Wall Street positions until the late 1960s, when he and Ruane decided to start their own investment firm. In 1969, they opened Ruane, Cunniff & Stires. They launched what would become their flagship mutual fund, Sequoia, in July 1970. Both the Fund and the investment manager, now known as Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, have thrived. Forty-five years later we remain proudly independent and thankful for the many contributions of our co-founder. Rick was married for 64 years to the former Marilyn Feld. She survives him, as do four of their five children: Richard Jr., Peter, Hilary and Jeanne Foussard. His beloved eldest daughter Carley, who worked beside him at Ruane, Cunniff for many years and was a director of Sequoia, died in 2005. Always courteous, pleasant and patient, Rick was a rigorous stock analyst, a generous mentor to younger colleagues and an admired regular presence in our office into his late-80s. We send our deepest condolences to Marilyn and his family."

As a proud part of the Navy's V-12 program at Colgate, he completed his officer training and was posted to Pearl Harbor in 1944 to serve aboard LCI(G)451, one of the Navy's Landing Craft Infantry (Gunnery) ships. These vessels played a key role in protecting the first waves of amphibious troops from shore-based enemy fire. Rick served in several combat operations including the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the landings at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, and Okinawa. In 1946 he was released from active duty as a Lieutenant (jg). Rick entered Harvard Business School in 1948, and in June 1949 he married Marilyn P. Feld (also of Rockville Centre). He and Marilyn were anticipating the celebration of their 65th wedding anniversary this coming June. Rick received his MBA in 1950 and began his career working for investment firms including Kidder, Peabody; Ferris & Co.; Sterling, Grace & Co.; Keswick Corp.; MacKay-Shields; and Andresen & Co. In 1969, Rick joined with William J. Ruane to found the investment firm of Ruane, Cunniff & Stires (Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb today), and they created the Sequoia Fund the following year. In his heart, Rick always considered himself a securities analyst. Passionate about the importance of rigorous research, Rick and the firm achieved a well-earned reputation for integrity, and in the years since its founding the firm has been able to achieve one of the most outstanding long-term performance records in the mutual fund industry. He was especially proud that his daughter Carley joined Ruane Cunniff & Goldfarb in 1983 and went on to serve as Executive Vice President and a Director of both RCG and the Sequoia Fund. She was an important part of the firm's growth until her illness in 2001. Rick was a corporate director of Sturm, Ruger & Co. from 1986 to 2007 and a Trustee Emeritus of Colgate University, to which he devoted boundless energy and generosity throughout his lifetime. Rick's other interests included sailing, golf, and politics (even at 91, he was still reading four newspapers every morning). Known for his wonderful sense of humor and willingness to help others in both professional and personal matters, Rick will be deeply missed by many. He is survived by his wife Marilyn; his children Richard Cunniff Jr., Peter Cunniff (Felicia), Hilary Cunniff, and Jeanne Foussard (Phillip); grandchildren Daniel and Claire Foussard, Lily Cunniff and Gareth Cunniff; his sister Lesley Ketzel, and son-in-law Andy Baxter. He was preceded in death by his daughter Carley and brother Frank. A memorial program will be held at The University Club, 1 W. 54th St., NYC on April 29 at 11:00am. Contributions in Rick's memory may be made to the Visiting Nurse Service & Hospice of Suffolk (505 Main Street, Northport, NY 11768) or to Colgate University (13 Oak Drive, Hamilton, NY 13346)."

2014-03-27T00:00:00Z,"CUNNIFF--Richard Trolan. Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb mourns the passing of our co-founder and longtime vice chairman, Richard T. Cunniff, at the age of 91. Rick was the consummate stock analyst, a true gentleman and a proud veteran of World War II. Rick's life was profoundly affected by his military service. As a 21-year old Ensign and later Lieutenant (jg) on an amphibious ship, he participated in some of the most intense naval battles of the war, including Leyte Gulf in October 1944. His ship made landings at Lingayen Gulf and Luzon in the Philippines and Okinawa in 1945. In later years, Rick would occasionally remark that no stock market disturbance could compare to being 21 years old on the deck of a small vessel in the Pacific, surrounded by enemy ships and kamikaze planes, taking fire. Rick completed his degree at Colgate in 1945 and graduated from Harvard Business School in 1950. Upon graduation from Harvard, Rick joined Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York City, where he met his future business partner William J. Ruane. Rick advanced through a series of Wall Street positions until the late 1960s, when he and Ruane decided to start their own investment firm. In 1969, they opened Ruane, Cunniff & Stires. They launched what would become their flagship mutual fund, Sequoia, in July 1970. Both the Fund and the investment manager, now known as Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, have thrived. Forty-five years later we remain proudly independent and thankful for the many contributions of our co-founder. Rick was married for 64 years to the former Marilyn Feld. She survives him, as do four of their five children: Richard Jr., Peter, Hilary and Jeanne Foussard. His beloved eldest daughter Carley, who worked beside him at Ruane, Cunniff for many years and was a director of Sequoia, died in 2005. Always courteous, pleasant and patient, Rick was a rigorous stock analyst, a generous mentor to younger colleagues and an admired regular presence in our office into his late-80s. We send our deepest condolences to Marilyn and his family."

2014-03-28T00:00:00Z,"GOLDMANN--Eva Petschek, was born in Prague, Czech Republic, in 1920 and came to the United States via Canada in 1938. After training as a nursery school teacher, she practiced in Detroit and New York. She was a fine pianist, but too modest to enter the career professionally. Having studied education in England, she became an early education teacher at the Roeper School in Detroit, MI, and taught piano to young students. After moving to New York City, she became associated with the Diller-Quaile School of Music as a volunteer. Eva married the journalist Robert B. Goldmann, immigrant from Germany, in 1948. At that time, Robert was an announcer in German for the Voice of America. They shared a multilingual past, and a deep love of classical music, with emphasis on Mozart, Schubert, and Beethoven, as well as Verdi's operas and Wagner's music dramas. Verdi's Otello, Wagner's Walkuere, and most of all Die Meistersinger von Nuernberg, were their common super-favorites. Bob's journalistic work - chiefly with the International Herald Tribune, while Bob and Eva lived in Paris, representing the Anti-Defamation League in Europe - was a new phase in their joint re-exploration of Europe, where they had spent a terror-filled-or-feared youth. Why couldn't the Europeans think of living as a community earlier, Eva would ask, in full knowledge that the time just had not been ripe. Eva loved her new country, and often encouraged Bob to do more exploring of the American landscape, which they did, but Bob, still yearning for a trip across the Atlantic, with Eva's in our time justified distrust of flying led her to cross on the QE2. Underplaying the distinguished past of her family in Prague, it was because she didn't have to show off, she never did. Her husband, children Peter, Andrea and Judith and six grandchildren mourn her and will never forget her."

2014-03-28T00:00:00Z,"CUNNIFF--Richard Trolan, died of complications from congestive heart failure on March 23, 2014, at his home in Lloyd Harbor, NY. He was 91. Rick was born on January 20, 1923, in the Bronx, New York, the son of Frank George and Florence Trolan Cunniff. He graduated from South Side High School in Rockville Centre, NY in 1941 and enrolled in Colgate University just in time for America's entry into World War II. As a proud part of the Navy's V-12 program at Colgate, he completed his officer training and was posted to Pearl Harbor in 1944 to serve aboard LCI(G)451, one of the Navy's Landing Craft Infantry (Gunnery) ships. These vessels played a key role in protecting the first waves of amphibious troops from shore-based enemy fire. Rick served in several combat operations including the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the landings at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, and Okinawa. In 1946 he was released from active duty as a Lieutenant (jg). Rick entered Harvard Business School in 1948, and in June 1949 he married Marilyn P. Feld (also of Rockville Centre). He and Marilyn were anticipating the celebration of their 65th wedding anniversary this coming June. Rick received his MBA in 1950 and began his career working for investment firms including Kidder, Peabody; Ferris & Co.; Sterling, Grace & Co.; Keswick Corp.; MacKay-Shields; and Andresen & Co. In 1969, Rick joined with William J. Ruane to found the investment firm of Ruane, Cunniff & Stires (Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb today), and they created the Sequoia Fund the following year. In his heart, Rick always considered himself a securities analyst. Passionate about the importance of rigorous research, Rick and the firm achieved a well-earned reputation for integrity, and in the years since its founding the firm has been able to achieve one of the most outstanding long-term performance records in the mutual fund industry. He was especially proud that his daughter Carley joined Ruane Cunniff & Goldfarb in 1983 and went on to serve as Executive Vice President and a Director of both RCG and the Sequoia Fund. She was an important part of the firm's growth until her illness in 2001. Rick was a corporate director of Sturm, Ruger & Co. from 1986 to 2007 and a Trustee Emeritus of Colgate University, to which he devoted boundless energy and generosity throughout his lifetime. Rick's other interests included sailing, golf, and politics (even at 91, he was still reading four newspapers every morning). Known for his wonderful sense of humor and willingness to help others in both professional and personal matters, Rick will be deeply missed by many. He is survived by his wife Marilyn; his children Richard Cunniff Jr., Peter Cunniff (Felicia), Hilary Cunniff, and Jeanne Foussard (Phillip); grandchildren Daniel and Claire Foussard, Lily Cunniff and Gareth Cunniff; his sister Lesley Ketzel, and son-in-law Andy Baxter.

Rick was the consummate stock analyst, a true gentleman and a proud veteran of World War II. Rick's life was profoundly affected by his military service. As a 21-year old Ensign and later Lieutenant (jg) on an amphibious ship, he participated in some of the most intense naval battles of the war, including Leyte Gulf in October 1944. His ship made landings at Lingayen Gulf and Luzon in the Philippines and Okinawa in 1945. In later years, Rick would occasionally remark that no stock market disturbance could compare to being 21 years old on the deck of a small vessel in the Pacific, surrounded by enemy ships and kamikaze planes, taking fire. Rick completed his degree at Colgate in 1945 and graduated from Harvard Business School in 1950. Upon graduation from Harvard, Rick joined Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York City, where he met his future business partner William J. Ruane. Rick advanced through a series of Wall Street positions until the late 1960s, when he and Ruane decided to start their own investment firm. In 1969, they opened Ruane, Cunniff & Stires. They launched what would become their flagship mutual fund, Sequoia, in July 1970. Both the Fund and the investment manager, now known as Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, have thrived. Forty-five years later we remain proudly independent and thankful for the many contributions of our co-founder. Rick was married for 64 years to the former Marilyn Feld. She survives him, as do four of their five children: Richard Jr., Peter, Hilary and Jeanne Foussard. His beloved eldest daughter Carley, who worked beside him at Ruane, Cunniff for many years and was a director of Sequoia, died in 2005. Always courteous, pleasant and patient, Rick was a rigorous stock analyst, a generous mentor to younger colleagues and an admired regular presence in our office into his late-80s. We send our deepest condolences to Marilyn and his family."

Arab-American, world traveler, loving wife, loyal friend, brilliant chef, kick-boxer, Samurai sword expert, and walking definition of the word chic, left the world far too early on March 20, 2014 after a long and brave battle against lymphoma. She is survived by her husband of 38 years, Bob Theis, his sons Kevin (Sara Nichols) and David (Susan Martinson) and their children, Miranda, Gwendolyn, Parker and Sydney, and her adored siblings, Malak Hasa, Suhair (Manfred) Jasevicuis, Maher (Thuria) Rimawi and Samir Rimawi. Jerusalem-born and Jordan-educated, Maysoun's early career was in advertising and film production in Chicago, where she met her husband. On her morning walk to the office, Maysoun would quite literally stop traffic on Michigan Avenue with her startling and exotic beauty. After moving to New York with Bob in 1976, Maysoun spent 25 years at Royal Jordanian Airlines - a career that allowed her to experience the one great love she had outside her marriage: travel. London has lost a great theatre-goer. Paris has lost a great diner. Rome has lost a great shopper. Sardinia has lost a beautiful sunbather. New York has lost a relentless gym rat. Maysoun lived, worked, and worked-out in New York City for over thirty-five years. After retiring in 2000, she and Bob purchased a small Sardinian villa in Porto Rafael, overlooking the Mediterranean. In 2011, Maysoun and Bob returned to Chicago, and Maysoun continued her kickboxing and Samurai sword training several days a week. In Chicago she developed close friendships with many dear and wonderful people who stood by her until the end.

2014-03-30T00:00:00Z,"Music is an auditory experience, yet much of what complements and surrounds it is visual. Album covers are the most obvious example, but musical notation itself is a graphic language. Graphic artists create pictorial compositions that have melodic sensibilities, and interpreting music through image is so common that some visual artists are said to orchestrate their works. These books show a range of musical inspirations, derivations and exaltations.

We, at the Mount Sinai Health System, are deeply saddened by the passing of Muriel Silberstein-Storfer, an arts advocate and gifted teacher whose passionate approach to arts education helped several generations of children uncover their own artistic creativity. Her unique programs were applauded by three New York City mayors and educators throughout the world. A pioneer, she served as the first representative from Staten Island on the New York City Arts Commission, and later, its first female president. She created Parent-Child workshops at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1971, which continue today, and served many years on the Museum's Board of Trustees. By founding Doing Art Together, she brought her distinctive hands-on teaching format to school children throughout New York City and became a popular and passionate lecturer at schools around the world.

The Trustees and staff of The Noguchi Museum join with the many who mourn the passing of the indefatigable and ever charming Priscilla Morgan, a founding member of the board and our first Honorary Life Trustee. A force of nature she stood loyally and steadfastly for all she believed in. Precise and high standards defined her and she brought these to the relationships and organizations she so dedicated herself to. Key amongst these was her love for Isamu Noguchi and by extension his Museum which she not only assisted in founding, but continually affirmed, and in her inimitable way helped lead. Her sparkle, her great stories, her mercurial ways and underlying warmth touched all who knew her. She will remain a guiding light to the Noguchi Museum as we move forward.

Born May 5, 1928 in Vienna, Austria, the only child of Ignaz von Kuffner whose family owned the Ottakringer Brewery there and Helene von Kuffner, nee Dreyfus, whose family founded the Basel, Switzerland-based bank of that name. Vera's childhood came to an abrupt end in 1938 when, just two weeks after the death of her father, she and her mother fled Vienna to escape the Nazis, traveling via Switzerland and England to settle in New York City in 1940. She attended the Birch Wathen School and received her BA from Vassar College in 1948 and a Masters in European History from Columbia University in 1950, where she also worked as assistant to the historian Jacques Barzun. She was a talented sculptor and member of the Art Students League in New York City, creating modern forms inspired by Jean Arp, with whom she apprenticed in Paris. In 1964, she married the investment banker Walter Eberstadt. For almost 50 years, she joined in his business and civic activities, traveled the world and collected art with him, supported educational and cultural institutions with him through the Eberstadt-Kuffner foundation, and took loving care of him until his death, just one month before hers. She loved her sons Michael and George, adored her grandchildren Max, Zoe, Maya, and Esme, and was devoted to her daughters-in-law Nina Beattie and Cynthia Young. Their summer home in Edgartown on Martha's Vineyard and their community of friends there were her great joy. Vera had a deep capacity to understand people, which made her both a wonderful listener and an enthralling storyteller, which she did with a bracing lack of varnish. She was the steadiest, most caring of friends, and she loved to bring her friends together. Her family and many friends will miss her so. Donations may be made in Vera's memory to the Frick Collection and to Doctors Without Borders. A memorial service will be held soon please contact George or Michael for information."

Born January 19, 1919 in New York City, she resided at 119 E. 81st Street. It is easy to see why 19 was her lucky number, but her favorite numbers were her six children, 17 grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren. Her attention to her family earned her the affectionate nickname, ""Mother Goose."" Above all, Illa was devoted to her husband, Jim. Illa, the daughter of Henrietta Rosa Kleberg and John Adrian Larkin, graduated from the Ethel Walker School, of Simsbury, CT. She married James (Jim) H. Clement in 1943. In 1949, the family moved to South Texas. From recreating Raglands Department store into a premier shopping destination to designing beautiful tapestries, Illa's artistry and flair were only matched by her energy and work ethic. As indefatigable as she was, she also was very involved in philanthropy and volunteer work. She helped start and build the Epiphany Episcopal Day School in Kingsville, TX and she often privately came to the aid of many families in need. While actively engaged in a variety of community based efforts, she was most proud of her support of NAS- Kingsville, so it is possible the Blue Angels winged her away after their recent visit. In spite of not attending college she became a treasured member of the Trinity University board in San Antonio, TX. She also served on the boards of and was active with Celanese, the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts and the James Madison Council of the Library of Congress. A lifelong Republican, she worked tirelessly to bring a viable two party system to South Texas. Illa will be dearly missed and will be most fondly remembered for her contagious laugh and fun-loving spirit. She is survived by her children, daughter Leslie and husband, Pat Jackson; daughter, Pruyn Hildebrand; son, Martin and wife, Melinda; daughter, Ida Louise and husband John T. Steen Jr.; son Jamey and wife Judy; daughter Alice and husband Eric Foultz; 17 grandchildren: Henrietta and husband, Eric Armbruster; Perry C.

James ""Jimmy"" Benkard, a brilliant litigator with Davis Polk & Wardwell who devoted himself to his professional craft as well as to leading and invariably improving an extraordinary number of civic and social organizations, died on April 1, 2014. He was born on April 10, 1937 in New York City, the son of the late Franklin Bartlett Benkard and Laura Derby Dupee Benkard. He attended St. Bernard's School in New York City, St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts and Harvard College, where he was sports editor of the Harvard Crimson. After college, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps and then attended Columbia Law School. In 1964, Jimmy married Margaret Walker Spofford, whom he cherished for the rest of his life. They raised three children, Andrew Benkard, James Benkard, and Margaret Benkard Chaves, and six grandchildren, Penelope, Dexter and Oscar Benkard, Evelyn Benkard Gaumnitz, and Maggie and Nathaniel Chaves. He is also survived by his sister, Joan Derby Benkard Jackson. Upon graduation from law school in 1963, Jimmy joined Davis Polk and spent his professional career with the firm, litigating a broad variety of commercial matters. He tried cases and argued appeals, including in the United States Supreme Court. Jimmy was beloved within his firm for his interest in guiding and teaching younger lawyers. After his retirement, he continued leading the firm's pro bono practice and mentoring the lawyers involved in the work. Last year, Jimmy was awarded the Norman Redlich Capital Defense Pro Bono Award by the New York City Bar Association, in recognition of decades of skilled advocacy on behalf of death row inmates. Jimmy was a Trustee of the Environmental Defense Fund and for years oversaw much of their litigation activity. He also served on the boards of Vassar College, St. Mark's School, Prisoners' Legal Services, and Teachers College, Columbia University. He took particular delight in serving as President of the Knickerbocker Club in New York City from 2003-2013 and as a Governor of that organization for four decades. Jimmy and his family kept a house on Fishers Island, New York where he similarly devoted himself to the community, serving for years as the Secretary and a board member of the Fishers Island Development Corporation, and as President of the Hay Harbor Club from 1981-1984. Jimmy was renowned for his skill at public speaking. As a colleague noted, Jimmy's comments always contained a rare combination of specificity, cogency, and humor. His speeches were unfailingly marked by wit and grace and were highly anticipated. Members of the organizations he led, as well as his colleagues at Davis Polk, flocked to events that under other circumstances would be tedious, simply to hear and laugh with Jimmy Benkard. A memorial service will be held at 11am on Wednesday, April 9 at The Brick Presbyterian Church, located at 91st Street and Park Avenue. The family would prefer memorial gifts in his memory be directed to either The Innocence Project or the Fishers Island Recreational Path Foundation, in lieu of flowers."

For almost 50 years, she joined in his business and civic activities, traveled the world and collected art with him, supported educational and cultural institutions with him through the Eberstadt-Kuffner foundation, and took loving care of him until his death, just one month before hers. She loved her sons Michael and George, adored her grandchildren Max, Zoe, Maya, and Esme, and was devoted to her daughters-in-law Nina Beattie and Cynthia Young. Their summer home in Edgartown on Martha's Vineyard and their community of friends there were her great joy.

2014-04-08T00:00:00Z,"DOYLE--Joseph Anthony. 93, beloved husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, died peacefully at home on April 5, 2014 with his wife of nearly 70 years at his side. He was born on June 13, 1920 in The Bronx, NY to Joseph A. Doyle Sr. and Jane Donahue. The oldest of five children and the only boy, Joe and his family moved many times following their salesman father. Joe was unusually bright and made the family very proud by earning a BS from Georgetown University in 1941. He then served as a Navy pilot in the Pacific during WWII earning the Navy Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross with three gold stars and the Air Medal with seven gold stars. While at Georgetown he met a Marymount College student, Eugenie Fleri, and on August 19, 1944, while on leave from the war, they married, commencing the happy marriage that both partners credited for their long and healthy lives. Together they raised five children, traveled widely, and enjoyed going to the ballet. He always supported Genie's career as a doctor and benefited greatly from her tender, expert care at the end of his life. After the war, on the advice of his commanding officer, he entered Columbia Law School on the GI Bill, and after graduating in 1947 enjoyed a long career as partner at Shearman & Sterling in New York City. Continuing to value his Navy career Joe served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1979-1981. During this time, Genie commuted from her job at NYU Medical Center to make a home for him in Washington DC. He always spoke of his gratitude to her for making his public service possible. He served on the Board of Directors of Fuji Bank & Trust and of the United Service Organizations of Metropolitan NY. He was also proud of his service on the Roxbury Land Trust Board in the Connecticut town where he maintained a weekend and summer home at which his large family could gather. He is survived by his wife, Genie, his sister, Mary, five children and their spouses, Christopher and wife, Laurie; Stephen and wife, Kathryn Fuller; Eugenie and husband Sam Burr; Jane Marie and husband John Day, Jr., Richard and wife Kate. His strong work ethic, loyalty to family, and devotion to duty has deeply affected his children. Joe was immensely proud of them. He was the loved and respected patriarch, ""Pipa"", to grandchildren, Sarah, Michael, Anne, Matthew, Peter, Margaret, Nora, Silas, Caleb, Nick, Addie, Helen, and Brendan. He lived to enjoy the news of his first great-grandchild, Noah. He also leaves many devoted nephews and nieces. He was predeceased by his parents, and three sisters, Jayne, Anne, and Sheila. When interviewed for a family history book in 2000, he said, ""If someone asked, 'What is the most important step that you took in your whole life to be as well off as you are now,' I would say, 'Marrying a woman who saw things the way I do, without my having to persuade her or she having to persuade me'. We have a common understanding of what life means and what's important."" He also said, ""Always concentrating on where you are going is very important and you're the pilot. Remember, you're the pilot."" Visiting hours at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Ave., NYC, Tuesday, April 8, 6-8pm. There will be a Funeral Mass Wednesday at 10am at St. Joseph's Church, 371 Sixth Ave."

He was born on June 13, 1920 in The Bronx, NY to Joseph A. Doyle Sr. and Jane Donahue. The oldest of five children and the only boy, Joe and his family moved many times following their salesman father. Joe was unusually bright and made the family very proud by earning a BS from Georgetown University in 1941. He then served as a Navy pilot in the Pacific during WWII earning the Navy Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross with three gold stars and the Air Medal with seven gold stars. While at Georgetown he met a Marymount College student, Eugenie Fleri, and on August 19, 1944, while on leave from the war, they married, commencing the happy marriage that both partners credited for their long and healthy lives. Together they raised five children, traveled widely, and enjoyed going to the ballet. He always supported Genie's career as a doctor and benefited greatly from her tender, expert care at the end of his life. After the war, on the advice of his commanding officer, he entered Columbia Law School on the GI Bill, and after graduating in 1947 enjoyed a long career as partner at Shearman & Sterling in New York City. Continuing to value his Navy career Joe served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1979-1981. During this time, Genie commuted from her job at NYU Medical Center to make a home for him in Washington DC. He always spoke of his gratitude to her for making his public service possible. He served on the Board of Directors of Fuji Bank & Trust and of the United Service Organizations of Metropolitan NY. He was also proud of his service on the Roxbury Land Trust Board in the Connecticut town where he maintained a weekend and summer home at which his large family could gather. He is survived by his wife, Genie, his sister, Mary, five children and their spouses, Christopher and wife, Laurie; Stephen and wife, Kathryn Fuller; Eugenie and husband Sam Burr; Jane Marie and husband John Day, Jr., Richard and wife Kate. His strong work ethic, loyalty to family, and devotion to duty has deeply affected his children. Joe was immensely proud of them. He was the loved and respected patriarch, ""Pipa"", to grandchildren, Sarah, Michael, Anne, Matthew, Peter, Margaret, Nora, Silas, Caleb, Nick, Addie, Helen, and Brendan. He lived to enjoy the news of his first great-grandchild, Noah. He also leaves many devoted nephews and nieces. He was predeceased by his parents, and three sisters, Jayne, Anne, and Sheila. When interviewed for a family history book in 2000, he said, ""If someone asked, 'What is the most important step that you took in your whole life to be as well off as you are now,' I would say, 'Marrying a woman who saw things the way I do, without my having to persuade her or she having to persuade me'. We have a common understanding of what life means and what's important."" He also said, ""Always concentrating on where you are going is very important and you're the pilot. Remember, you're the pilot."" Visiting hours at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Ave., NYC, Tuesday, April 8, 6-8pm.

2014-04-11T00:00:00Z,"CARLIN--Phyllis. Was born in Newark, NJ in 1929 to Gertrude and Walter Goldberg. She died peacefully on April 6th at home in Maplewood, NJ from the effects of lung cancer. She was a loving mother, sister, aunt, grandmother, daughter, relative, companion and friend. But above all she was an artist, a creative spirit who made paintings, sculpture and ceramics with great skill that delighted everyone who saw them. She grew up during the Depression at a time when there were few opportunities for women to be artists, much less find work in the field. But she became one of the first women admitted into the union of United Scenic Artists and painted sets for a variety of important productions in New York ranging from the Metropolitan Opera to the Ed Sullivan show. She continued to do so after her first son, John was born; but stopped and moved back to New Jersey after her second son, Tom, arrived. Phyllis spent most of the next two decades taking care of her family while remaining an active participant in the New York art world, visiting the Museum of Modern Art almost every week for over half a century as well as other museums, theater and gallery shows. At the same time she began an active career at home, painting a series of accomplished work that blended modernism with domestic portraits of familiar faces. A man could be standing in the center of a blank room with a gob of painted smeared across his body and a dog howling discretely in the background. Or a blur of beautiful stars could blend into a patterned landscape that made it seem as if Paul Klee was living in suburban New Jersey. The whimsical quality of the paintings, assemblages and objects came from Phyllis' unique spirit and joy in finding wonderful things in the world and in the people around her, combined with a focus on quality and craft. She worked at her art and her relationships in a way that never seemed labored and always ended up as good as possible. As she grew older she never grew old, always finding new things and new people to share her delight in the world. She spent much of the past twenty years with her companion Bob Collier and nurturing her three grandchildren, Magritte, Mallory and Dexter; helping them grow and find the same joy she was able to take and give from everything around her. She lives on in our hearts and imagination."

2014-04-11T00:00:00Z,"KURNOW--Ernest. The NYU Stern community mourns the loss of its beloved professor, Ernest Kurnow, who died April 7th. He celebrated his 101st birthday in October 2013. A recipient of NYU's Great Teacher Award, he taught statistics for more than 60 years, last as an adjunct in 2010. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was his student. Prof. Kurnow created the Statistics Department at NYU Stern and chaired it from 1963 until 1975, a period in which the School focused on building full-time, research-based MBA and PhD programs. He recruited many of the School's most prominent professors. His path-breaking book, ""Statistics for Business Decisions,"" changed the way the subject was taught by introducing sampling procedures to basic statistics. Ernie was born in Brooklyn in 1912 and received his BA and MA in mathematics from New York City College in 1932 and 1933, respectively. Before joining NYU, he worked at the WPA; the Aberdeen Proving Ground, the military base in Maryland where important innovations in computing and the application of statistical quality control were developed; and the New York City Board of Education. Those who had the good fortune to know Ernie also know how much he will be missed. The family has asked that those interested in honoring his legacy donate to the Ernest Kurnow Fellowship c/o NYU Stern, 44 West 4th St., Suite 10-46, NY, NY 10012."

2014-04-13T00:00:00Z,"SILVERMAN--Arthur (Arty), 96, died on Tuesday, April 8th, 2014 in Boca Raton, Florida. Services will be held on Sunday, April 13th 2014 at 10:00am at Bernheim-Apter-Kneitzman Suburban Funeral Chapel in Livingston, New Jersey. Interment will be at Beth Israel Cemetery in Edison, NJ. Born and raised in Newark, New Jersey, Arty lived for many years in Warren, New Jersey before moving to Boca Raton, Florida. He was a graduate of Central High School in Newark. Coming from humble beginnings, Arty received a Boy Scout Scholarship that enabled him to fulfill his dream of going to college. He attended Newark College Of Engineering (now NJIT) where he received a degree in Mechanical Engineering. For more than 25 years, Arthur's participation in the NJIT Alumni Association, including his service as president, helped him to keep up with the latest technological developments. During his active years with the Alumni Association, he established the Silverman Scholarships, which were awarded to five NJIT students in honor NCE Dean Allen R. Cullimore, who helped him to obtain the scholarship he desperately needed to begin his undergraduate studies in 1935. In 1997 Arthur was honored with NJIT's Distinguished Alumni Medal for Outstanding Achievement. Arthur founded The Union Machine Company in 1947 which ultimately became Silver Line Building Products Corporation in 1960, a manufacturer of aluminum windows and doors. Recognizing a change in the industry, Arty and his son Ken became one of the first innovators to transition from aluminum to vinyl windows and doors. The risky move paid off as Silver Line became the largest vinyl window and door manufacturer in North America. Arty's innovative designs and engineering ability enabled him to create numerous patents which are still recognized today in the vinyl window industry. His great passion for art is demonstrated by his many accomplished sculptures. He also loved golfing, boating and travel. He leaves his wife Georgia, three children, Laurie and husband Peter Friedman, Kenneth and wife Claudia Silverman, Joan and husband Stanley Baer along with his six grandchildren, Michael, Jaclyn, Britany, Blake, Ashley, Alana and seven great-grandchildren. He also leaves behind step-daughters Wendy Chivian, Karen and her husband Michael Toback and their two children, Ella and Cara. Donations may be made in Arty's name to a charity of your choice."

2014-04-14T00:00:00Z,"APPEL--Valentine, of Big Canoe in Jasper, Georgia, and former long time resident of New York, died Saturday morning, April 12, 2014. Val died in his home, at the age of 88, after a lengthy struggle with heart disease. Val was born on February 13, 1926 in the Bronx, New York. He was the only child of Valentine Appel, Sr. and Adolfine Pelzl-Appel. His parents were of German descent, which allowed Valentine to become fluent in the German language as a child. Valentine grew up in the Bronx and he learned alpine skiing in Van Cortland Park. His ability to ski and his command of the German language served him well while fighting the Germans as an infantryman in Northern Italy during World War II with the US Army 10th Mountain Division. Valentine was wounded twice during World War II and was awarded the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster for gallantry during combat action in the North Apennines Po Valley in Italy. He took part in the liberation of Florence, Italy from the Germans. Following his honorable discharge from the US Army after World War II, Valentine went onto college and graduate school under the GI Bill, earning a PhD in Industrial Psychology from New York University. Val had a long and distinguished career in the media and market research industry, working for Benton & Bowles, Ford Motor Company and Ted Bates. Valentine was involved in advertising from the very infancy of television and media research. He conducted extensive research studies on viewer ad recognition recall of TV commercials. Those standards of effective advertising frequency are used by the media industry today. During the course of his career, Valentine formed his own company, AHF Marketing Research, which he later sold to Columbia Pictures. The media research company that he founded is still in business. For a number of years, Val served as President of the Advertising Research Foundation. He also worked for Simmons Market Research Bureau, conducting syndicated and proprietary media and market research studies for the magazine industry. At the end of his career, Valentine started Appel Advertising Research whose primary clients included the Wall Street Journal and National Enquirer. Just days before his death, Valentine celebrated the birth of his first great-grandchild, Ian Valentine Wilson and his 63rd wedding anniversary with his wife Patricia. Valentine is survived by his wife Patricia Fisher Appel, daughters, Suzanne Appel Wilson, Jasper, Georgia, Marguerite Appel Gardner, Weaverville, North Carolina, sons Gregory V.

Her passions were palpable and they were many, including being an avid reader and gardener.

2014-04-17T00:00:00Z,"ROSEN--Leonard M.,All of us at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz are deeply saddened by the death of our dear colleague and friend, Leonard M. Rosen, at age 83. We will miss him greatly. We will be inspired by him always. Leonard was a founder of our Firm, and was instrumental in making it what it is today. He was a partner from 1965, when, intrepidly, together with Martin Lipton, Herbert Wachtell and George Katz, all graduates of NYU Law School, he launched our practice, until 1997, when he retired. In his retirement, he served as Of Counsel to our Firm until his passing on April 16, 2014. Leonard created, and led, the Firm's creditors' rights group. He transformed it into one of the nation's leading bankruptcy practices, representing banks, insurance companies, bondholders, and other institutional creditors. He counseled, advised, and advocated and negotiated for his clients on all manner of bankruptcy matters. He was a student of the law -- author of numerous articles on bankruptcy law, and a draftsman of sections of the leading treatise in the field. He was also a teacher of the law, serving for many years as an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law, where he introduced aspiring lawyers to the subject he so loved. He was a leader of the bar, and a shaper of the law. He contributed to the drafting of the Bankruptcy Code and, as Chairman of the National Bankruptcy Conference from 1984 to 1992, played a leading role in the Code's development. He received the American College of Bankruptcy's Distinguished Service Award in 2003, along with many other accolades for his accomplishments during his decades of distinguished practice. As the leader of the Firm's bankruptcy and restructuring practice, Leonard was the attorney to whom our major institutional creditor clients so often turned first when credit problems arose with a major corporate borrower. To him they looked for judgment and leadership. And to him we looked for wisdom and guidance. By the time he retired, he had built a practice group so eminent that it was called upon by the United States Department of the Treasury to design and implement the immense government rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- the largest ever. Throughout his career, the matters Leonard handled were enormously consequential. In 1975, his client was the City of New York. It was on the verge of bankruptcy. The federal government had refused to help, and the Daily News headline famously screamed, ""Ford to City: Drop Dead."" After President Ford relented, Leonard stayed up round the clock with virtually the entire Firm, in the effort to prepare the complex and myriad agreements, securities, legislation and tax rulings needed so the City could obtain critical financing before year-end. At almost the same time, Leonard led the Firm's team that represented W. T. Grant during its historic bankruptcy -- the first billion-dollar Chapter 11 case, and the last in which the Firm was the lead counsel for a bankruptcy debtor. The list of historic matters goes on: Leonard represented the bank lenders to Chrysler during its government bailout in the early 1980s. He masterfully forged an agreement among Chrysler and each of its more than 400 bank lenders, an agreement that enabled Chrysler to survive and prosper during a period in which its failure appeared imminent. Leonard was also the lead attorney for the principal lenders in the debt restructurings and bankruptcies of many other major corporations in the real estate, financial, energy, agricultural equipment, steel and aircraft industries. But above all, Leonard was a good man. A generous man. A kind man. A man you could trust with your most difficult problems and deepest concerns, a superb partner who represented, and will always represent, all we strive to be as lawyers, citizens, and human beings. He was much sought after for his judgment, as well as for his marvelous ability to resolve disputes and reconcile disparate views. He shaped the culture of our Firm. He was the glue that cemented a group of hard-working and talented attorneys into a leading law firm that has served as a model for other firms. He was not only admired and respected by his colleagues; he was beloved. Leonard was deeply involved in the work of the Lymphoma Research Foundation and the Children's Cause for Cancer Advocacy. The entire Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz family sends its deepest condolences to Leonard's wife Phyllis, his sons Adam, Steven and David, his daughter Carol, and his nine grandchildren. We share your loss, and your love for our dear friend Leonard."

No one served NYU better or more faithfully than he, or did more to shape the NYU we know today. Starting as a member of the history faculty in 1960, he went on to be the last dean of the Heights campus, helping to guide NYU through some of its most challenging moments. From that point forward, through his tenure as chancellor and then president, he had a key hand in engineering what has been described as the greatest success story in contemporary American higher education. Understanding the diversity of student success at NYU, he cheered on NYU's top students, our athletes, our performing artists, and our community service volunteers.

2014-04-18T00:00:00Z,"ROSEN--Leonard M.,All of us at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz are deeply saddened by the death of our dear colleague and friend, Leonard M. Rosen, at age 83. We will miss him greatly. We will be inspired by him always. Leonard was a founder of our Firm, and was instrumental in making it what it is today. He was a partner from 1965, when, intrepidly, together with Martin Lipton, Herbert Wachtell and George Katz, all graduates of NYU Law School, he launched our practice, until 1997, when he retired. In his retirement, he served as Of Counsel to our Firm until his passing on April 16, 2014. Leonard created, and led, the Firm's creditors' rights group. He transformed it into one of the nation's leading bankruptcy practices, representing banks, insurance companies, bondholders, and other institutional creditors. He counseled, advised, and advocated and negotiated for his clients on all manner of bankruptcy matters. He was a student of the law -- author of numerous articles on bankruptcy law, and a draftsman of sections of the leading treatise in the field. He was also a teacher of the law, serving for many years as an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law, where he introduced aspiring lawyers to the subject he so loved. He was a leader of the bar, and a shaper of the law. He contributed to the drafting of the Bankruptcy Code and, as Chairman of the National Bankruptcy Conference from 1984 to 1992, played a leading role in the Code's development. He received the American College of Bankruptcy's Distinguished Service Award in 2003, along with many other accolades for his accomplishments during his decades of distinguished practice. As the leader of the Firm's bankruptcy and restructuring practice, Leonard was the attorney to whom our major institutional creditor clients so often turned first when credit problems arose with a major corporate borrower. To him they looked for judgment and leadership. And to him we looked for wisdom and guidance. By the time he retired, he had built a practice group so eminent that it was called upon by the United States Department of the Treasury to design and implement the immense government rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- the largest ever. Throughout his career, the matters Leonard handled were enormously consequential. In 1975, his client was the City of New York. It was on the verge of bankruptcy. The federal government had refused to help, and the Daily News headline famously screamed, ""Ford to City: Drop Dead."" After President Ford relented, Leonard stayed up round the clock with virtually the entire Firm, in the effort to prepare the complex and myriad agreements, securities, legislation and tax rulings needed so the City could obtain critical financing before year-end. At almost the same time, Leonard led the Firm's team that represented W. T. Grant during its historic bankruptcy -- the first billion-dollar Chapter 11 case, and the last in which the Firm was the lead counsel for a bankruptcy debtor. The list of historic matters goes on: Leonard represented the bank lenders to Chrysler during its government bailout in the early 1980s. He masterfully forged an agreement among Chrysler and each of its more than 400 bank lenders, an agreement that enabled Chrysler to survive and prosper during a period in which its failure appeared imminent. Leonard was also the lead attorney for the principal lenders in the debt restructurings and bankruptcies of many other major corporations in the real estate, financial, energy, agricultural equipment, steel and aircraft industries. But above all, Leonard was a good man. A generous man. A kind man. A man you could trust with your most difficult problems and deepest concerns, a superb partner who represented, and will always represent, all we strive to be as lawyers, citizens, and human beings. He was much sought after for his judgment, as well as for his marvelous ability to resolve disputes and reconcile disparate views. He shaped the culture of our Firm. He was the glue that cemented a group of hard-working and talented attorneys into a leading law firm that has served as a model for other firms. He was not only admired and respected by his colleagues; he was beloved. Leonard was deeply involved in the work of the Lymphoma Research Foundation and the Children's Cause for Cancer Advocacy. The entire Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz family sends its deepest condolences to Leonard's wife Phyllis, his sons Adam, Steven and David, his daughter Carol, and his nine grandchildren. We share your loss, and your love for our dear friend Leonard."

She married Peter Keller, WWII veteran and Bronze Star recipient, in 1945, and was with him for 59 years until his 2005 death. They moved from Joralemon Street in Brooklyn to Stuyvesant Town, where their daughters Lisa (Saky Yakas) and Nina (Rich Adago) were born. In 1960 they settled in New Rochelle. In the early 1960s an elementary school principal plucked her from the secretary's chair and put her in a classroom, where she had a crash course in how to teach. For 25 years she was a dedicated and beloved first grade teacher, first in the South Bronx and then in Greenburgh. She returned to college nights and weekends to earn a Master's in Education. In retirement, she became a tutor for home-bound students with both mental and physical disabilities. Children adored her, and she was enormously kind to anyone she met. She is survived by her daughters, sons-in-law, sister Renee, nephew Mark and Jeff, niece Lynette, and beloved grandchildren Benjamin, Perry, and Naomi. Services will take place at Temple Israel of New Rochelle Tuesday, April 22, 1 pm, followed by interment at Sharon Gardens, Valhalla. The family will host shiva at Norma's home afterwards. Gifts in memory can be made to the Norma Keller Fund, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Development Office (Attn. Tamiko Collier), 654 West 170th Street, New York, NY 10032."

2014-04-19T00:00:00Z,"ROSEN--Leonard M.,All of us at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz are deeply saddened by the death of our dear colleague and friend, Leonard M. Rosen, at age 83. We will miss him greatly. We will be inspired by him always. Leonard was a founder of our Firm, and was instrumental in making it what it is today. He was a partner from 1965, when, intrepidly, together with Martin Lipton, Herbert Wachtell and George Katz, all graduates of NYU Law School, he launched our practice, until 1997, when he retired. In his retirement, he served as Of Counsel to our Firm until his passing on April 16, 2014. Leonard created, and led, the Firm's creditors' rights group. He transformed it into one of the nation's leading bankruptcy practices, representing banks, insurance companies, bondholders, and other institutional creditors. He counseled, advised, and advocated and negotiated for his clients on all manner of bankruptcy matters. He was a student of the law -- author of numerous articles on bankruptcy law, and a draftsman of sections of the leading treatise in the field. He was also a teacher of the law, serving for many years as an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law, where he introduced aspiring lawyers to the subject he so loved. He was a leader of the bar, and a shaper of the law. He contributed to the drafting of the Bankruptcy Code and, as Chairman of the National Bankruptcy Conference from 1984 to 1992, played a leading role in the Code's development. He received the American College of Bankruptcy's Distinguished Service Award in 2003, along with many other accolades for his accomplishments during his decades of distinguished practice. As the leader of the Firm's bankruptcy and restructuring practice, Leonard was the attorney to whom our major institutional creditor clients so often turned first when credit problems arose with a major corporate borrower. To him they looked for judgment and leadership. And to him we looked for wisdom and guidance. By the time he retired, he had built a practice group so eminent that it was called upon by the United States Department of the Treasury to design and implement the immense government rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- the largest ever. Throughout his career, the matters Leonard handled were enormously consequential. In 1975, his client was the City of New York. It was on the verge of bankruptcy. The federal government had refused to help, and the Daily News headline famously screamed, ""Ford to City: Drop Dead."" After President Ford relented, Leonard stayed up round the clock with virtually the entire Firm, in the effort to prepare the complex and myriad agreements, securities, legislation and tax rulings needed so the City could obtain critical financing before year-end. At almost the same time, Leonard led the Firm's team that represented W. T. Grant during its historic bankruptcy -- the first billion-dollar Chapter 11 case, and the last in which the Firm was the lead counsel for a bankruptcy debtor. The list of historic matters goes on: Leonard represented the bank lenders to Chrysler during its government bailout in the early 1980s. He masterfully forged an agreement among Chrysler and each of its more than 400 bank lenders, an agreement that enabled Chrysler to survive and prosper during a period in which its failure appeared imminent. Leonard was also the lead attorney for the principal lenders in the debt restructurings and bankruptcies of many other major corporations in the real estate, financial, energy, agricultural equipment, steel and aircraft industries. But above all, Leonard was a good man. A generous man. A kind man. A man you could trust with your most difficult problems and deepest concerns, a superb partner who represented, and will always represent, all we strive to be as lawyers, citizens, and human beings. He was much sought after for his judgment, as well as for his marvelous ability to resolve disputes and reconcile disparate views. He shaped the culture of our Firm. He was the glue that cemented a group of hard-working and talented attorneys into a leading law firm that has served as a model for other firms. He was not only admired and respected by his colleagues; he was beloved. Leonard was deeply involved in the work of the Lymphoma Research Foundation and the Children's Cause for Cancer Advocacy. The entire Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz family sends its deepest condolences to Leonard's wife Phyllis, his sons Adam, Steven and David, his daughter Carol, and his nine grandchildren. We share your loss, and your love for our dear friend Leonard."

Born and raised in Rochester, NY, Bill was attending Williams College when he enlisted as a Lieutenant in the Navy on December 8, 1941. As a pilot in the Navy, he taught aerial photography and was later based on the carrier, Intrepid. After WWII, he graduated from Williams ('43), and with his first wife, Penelope, moved to Pennsylvania to work in R & D at Smith-Kline. His real love was aviation though, and in the 1950's, Bill bought and developed a field in West Chester, PA, which he eventually named Brandywine Airport. He loved the countryside there, and took pride in developing the land around the airport in an environmentally friendly manner. Throughout his life, his adventurous spirit never left him---flying his small plane, sailing his ""Winddance"", and skiing all over the world. He was known for the wonderful tales he told about his exploits. For over 65 years Bill was a member of the Adirondack League Club in Old Forge, NY, and even after moving to CA in 2003, he and his wife, Joan, whom he married in 1985, would drive across the country with their dog to this favorite place. The natural beauty of the Bay Area brought great enjoyment to him in his retirement. In addition to his wife, Bill is survived by his daughters, Linn Krieg of McAllister, MT, Suzanne Wilson of Big Timber, MT, Wendy O'Brien of Aiken, SC, Elizabeth Gonzalez of Oley, PA, and Victoria Wilson-Charles of Veneta, OR; his step-son, Steedman Hinckley of Chevy Chase, MD, 14 grandchildren, 17 great-grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. Memorial services will take place in Palo Alto, CA on May 17th and at the Adirondack League Club around August 23rd. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made online to the Peninsula Open Space Trust or to the Adirondack Council."

2014-04-20T00:00:00Z,"ROSEN--Leonard M.,All of us at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz are deeply saddened by the death of our dear colleague and friend, Leonard M. Rosen, at age 83. We will miss him greatly. We will be inspired by him always. Leonard was a founder of our Firm, and was instrumental in making it what it is today. He was a partner from 1965, when, intrepidly, together with Martin Lipton, Herbert Wachtell and George Katz, all graduates of NYU Law School, he launched our practice, until 1997, when he retired. In his retirement, he served as Of Counsel to our Firm until his passing on April 16, 2014. Leonard created, and led, the Firm's creditors' rights group. He transformed it into one of the nation's leading bankruptcy practices, representing banks, insurance companies, bondholders, and other institutional creditors. He counseled, advised, and advocated and negotiated for his clients on all manner of bankruptcy matters. He was a student of the law -- author of numerous articles on bankruptcy law, and a draftsman of sections of the leading treatise in the field. He was also a teacher of the law, serving for many years as an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law, where he introduced aspiring lawyers to the subject he so loved. He was a leader of the bar, and a shaper of the law. He contributed to the drafting of the Bankruptcy Code and, as Chairman of the National Bankruptcy Conference from 1984 to 1992, played a leading role in the Code's development. He received the American College of Bankruptcy's Distinguished Service Award in 2003, along with many other accolades for his accomplishments during his decades of distinguished practice. As the leader of the Firm's bankruptcy and restructuring practice, Leonard was the attorney to whom our major institutional creditor clients so often turned first when credit problems arose with a major corporate borrower. To him they looked for judgment and leadership. And to him we looked for wisdom and guidance. By the time he retired, he had built a practice group so eminent that it was called upon by the United States Department of the Treasury to design and implement the immense government rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- the largest ever. Throughout his career, the matters Leonard handled were enormously consequential. In 1975, his client was the City of New York. It was on the verge of bankruptcy. The federal government had refused to help, and the Daily News headline famously screamed, ""Ford to City: Drop Dead."" After President Ford relented, Leonard stayed up round the clock with virtually the entire Firm, in the effort to prepare the complex and myriad agreements, securities, legislation and tax rulings needed so the City could obtain critical financing before year-end. At almost the same time, Leonard led the Firm's team that represented W. T. Grant during its historic bankruptcy -- the first billion-dollar Chapter 11 case, and the last in which the Firm was the lead counsel for a bankruptcy debtor. The list of historic matters goes on: Leonard represented the bank lenders to Chrysler during its government bailout in the early 1980s. He masterfully forged an agreement among Chrysler and each of its more than 400 bank lenders, an agreement that enabled Chrysler to survive and prosper during a period in which its failure appeared imminent. Leonard was also the lead attorney for the principal lenders in the debt restructurings and bankruptcies of many other major corporations in the real estate, financial, energy, agricultural equipment, steel and aircraft industries. But above all, Leonard was a good man. A generous man. A kind man. A man you could trust with your most difficult problems and deepest concerns, a superb partner who represented, and will always represent, all we strive to be as lawyers, citizens, and human beings. He was much sought after for his judgment, as well as for his marvelous ability to resolve disputes and reconcile disparate views. He shaped the culture of our Firm. He was the glue that cemented a group of hard-working and talented attorneys into a leading law firm that has served as a model for other firms. He was not only admired and respected by his colleagues; he was beloved. Leonard was deeply involved in the work of the Lymphoma Research Foundation and the Children's Cause for Cancer Advocacy. The entire Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz family sends its deepest condolences to Leonard's wife Phyllis, his sons Adam, Steven and David, his daughter Carol, and his nine grandchildren. We share your loss, and your love for our dear friend Leonard."
2014-04-20T00:00:00Z,"SCHMIDT--Marsha A.,passed away quietly on April 14, 2014 surrounded by family and friends after a brief illness caused by acute pulmonary distress following surgery recovery. Born on October 4, 1943 in Hackensack, NJ, Marsha graduated from Tenafly High School in 1961 and from Hood College in Frederick, Maryland in 1965 after making lifelong friends at both schools. She excelled at languages and earned several graduate level teaching certificates which enabled her to teach Spanish and coach non-English speaking visiting diplomats from the United Nations who were new to New York City. She also had a successful career in Marketing and held several executive positions at book publisher Doubleday and Company. It was at Doubleday where Marsha met John O'Donnell, whom she married and spent ten happy years before his death in 1993. Since his death Marsha split her time between New York City and Oakdale, Long Island and enjoyed the loyal companionship of college and career friends. She loved to travel to Europe and especially to Mexico where she had enjoyed many happy vacations with John. Marsha is survived by her father, Werner Schmidt, of Yarmouth Port, Massachusetts and her brother Paul and his wife Mary of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and three nephews who live in Chicago and Seattle. She will be sorely missed by them and by all her friends around the country. A memorial celebration of her life is being planned for later this spring. Marsha, as did John, had a passion for domestic animals and their welfare as well as for medical research to combat cancer.

Understanding the diversity of student success at NYU, he cheered on NYU's top students, our athletes, our performing artists, and our community service volunteers.

2014-04-20T00:00:00Z,"GREEN--Lindsay Waggener. March 13, 1926 - April 11, 2014 of Wichita Falls, Texas and New York, NY. Airborne when she danced. Steadfast when she landed. Child of Texas, citizen of New York. Radiant, with a charm that set rooms aglow. Descendent of pioneers, soldiers and scholars. Inheritor of all that energy and spirit of inquiry, that gift for innovation, that vein of genius. An engine of creativity, a reservoir of humor and wit possessed of enviable literary and theatrical skills. Astonishing beauty and incandescent intellect, all brought to bear on her career of choice as delightful wife, devoted mother, adoring grandmother, caring friend. Bill, Ross, Nancy, Ellie will never forget her, nor will anyone who ever met her."
2014-04-20T00:00:00Z,"OLIVA--Dr. L. Jay. We who worked with Dr. L. Jay Oliva for more than 30 years were first-hand witnesses to the role he played in moving a near-bankrupt university in the 1970's to the leading national and international research university it is today. His vision, talent and devotion to academic values defined his tenure as professor, provost, chancellor and president. One key to his success was his love and devotion to the institution and his commitment to its communities of faculty, staff and students. He led a singular institutional transformation with no one left behind. He was a rare blend of dreamer and realist, pushing us all to try harder, reach farther and pursue ideas which often seemed out of reach, but have come to define the essence of NYU today. A man with a big heart, he sustained and nurtured New York University. We miss his leadership and his friendship. Our heartfelt condolences to his family. Sylvia Baruch Naomi Levine Ann Marcus C. Duncan Rice Harvey Stedman"
2014-04-20T00:00:00Z,"CAPRETZ--Pierre, creator of French in Action, the innovative French language instruction program, died on April 2 in Aix-en-Provence, France. He was 89 years old. French in Action, introduced in 1985, is a total immersion course, modeled on language acquisition in young children: you hear, you mimic, you repeat, and gradually you acquire understanding and a natural grammar. Not a word of English is used. It's estimated that the course has created over a million new French speakers throughout North America and overseas. Each video lecon is led by a jovial mentor in grasping the fundamentals of French, and becoming imbued with a soupcon of Frenchness, known as ""Le Professeur"": Pierre Capretz, naturally. He was born in Mazamet, France, and earned a law degree and doctorate from the Sorbonne in Paris. His career in language instruction began at the University of Florida, Gainesville, and went on to Yale University in 1956, until he retired. The revised 3rd edition of French in Action, 2014, brings the narrative into the age of Twitter and ""les bobos"", the French counterparts to brownstone bohemians. He is survived by his companion of many years, Sylvie Mathe and their son Pierre Olivier Mathe, both of Aix-en-Provence, three sons from a former marriage, Michel Yan of Mill River, MA, Yves of New Haven, CT, and Alain of Manhattan, and one grandson."

2014-04-20T00:00:00Z,"BESHAR--Robert Peter, 86, died peacefully at home in Somers, New York on April 16. The son of Herbert and Ella Beshar, Bob grew up in New Rochelle with his two brothers and sister. During his senior year at Yale University, Bob was appointed Scholar of the House and graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. While at Yale Law School, Bob met the love of his life, Christine von Wedemeyer. Christine was attending Smith College on a Fulbright. Bob and Christine were married in Germany in 1953. Late last year, they celebrated their 60th anniversary together with their four children -- Cornelia (Rob Spring), Jacky (Scot Jones), Fritz (Peter Lehner) and Peter (Sarah Beshar) -- and their fourteen grandchildren. Bob enjoyed a distinguished career in private practice. He also served in a number of government positions: Assistant General Counsel of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, law clerk for the Honorable Charles Breitel on the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director of the Bureau of International Commerce in Washington. After leaving the Commerce Department in 1972, Bob returned to New York to set up his own practice. Bob served as special counsel, then Corporate Secretary and, for almost thirty years, on the board of directors of National Semiconductor Corporation in Santa Clara, California. He was a member of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the Foundation Board of Westchester Community College and the Planning Board of the Town of Somers. In 1993, Bob became President of his family's rug and antiques business, Beshar's, in New York City. Bob's interests were varied and intense. A love of decorative arts -- bronzes, china, jewelry, clocks. He liked to say: ""the hand shapes the mind."" Reading novels late into the night -- convinced there was more truth in fiction than in non-fiction. Telling a great story over dinner and challenging children, grandchildren and startled guests to ""sing for their supper."" Driving, and carefully polishing, his convertible Mercedes with the license plate ""Besh"" -- his nickname at New Rochelle High School. Playing backgammon and eating Armenian food -- dolma, olives, cheoreg and lahmajoon. Trapshooting at Gipsy Trail with friends -- usually top gun and always wearing his trademark Stetson. Most of all, though, Bob adored his wife, his children and his grandchildren: Huyette, Peter, Alexander, Melissa, Vanessa, Lizi, Maddie, Scout, Nadine, Eliza, Marina, Isabel, Henry and Sophie. A service will be held at St. Luke's Church in Somers, New York on Saturday, April 26 at 11:00am, followed by a reception at the Stone House. The family has asked that those interested in honoring Bob's legacy consider a donation to Westchester Community College Foundation Hartford Hall, 75 Grasslands Road, Valhalla, New York 10595."

She married Peter Keller, WWII veteran and Bronze Star recipient, in 1945, and was with him for 59 years until his 2005 death. They moved from Joralemon Street in Brooklyn to Stuyvesant Town, where their daughters Lisa (Saky Yakas) and Nina (Rich Adago) were born. In 1960 they settled in New Rochelle. In the early 1960s an elementary school principal plucked her from the secretary's chair and put her in a classroom, where she had a crash course in how to teach. For 25 years she was a dedicated and beloved first grade teacher, first in the South Bronx and then in Greenburgh. She returned to college nights and weekends to earn a Master's in Education. In retirement, she became a tutor for home-bound students with both mental and physical disabilities. Children adored her, and she was enormously kind to anyone she met. She is survived by her daughters, sons-in-law, sister Renee, nephew Mark and Jeff, niece Lynette, and beloved grandchildren Benjamin, Perry, and Naomi.

2014-04-21T00:00:00Z,"SCRANTON--Suzanne Somersall Roberts, 89, the widow of Donald H. Roberts and S.Samuel Scranton, Jr., died of natural causes on April 14, 2014 at her residence at Clare Bridge of Vero Beach, FL. Born Suzanne Somersall Outerbridge on October 23, 1924 on the island of Bermuda, she was the daughter of Ira Stuart Outerbridge and Mary Trott Outerbridge. Through her parents, Mrs. Scranton was a direct descendant of two of the island's oldest families which had settled in Bermuda in the 17th Century. In 1939, Mrs. Scranton enrolled as a boarder at Dwight School for Girls (Englewood, NJ). There Mrs. Scranton made a number of life-long friends and developed a great love for America and New York City. After graduation from Dwight in June, 1943 as President of Dwight's Boarding Department, Mrs. Scranton returned to Bermuda. Shortly thereafter, she met and became engaged to her first husband and the father of her three children, Donald Roberts. Mr. Roberts, a First Lieutenant in the US Navy, was stationed in Bermuda with the USS Hamul prior to its departure in late 1944 to the Pacific. After their marriage ceremony in 1946, the couple moved to America. For 30 years, the couple lived in Summit, NJ where they raised their children. After Mr. Roberts' retirement in 1992, the couple moved to Vero Beach, FL. In 1996, Mr. Roberts died shortly after they had celebrated 50 years of marriage. In 2001, Mrs. Scranton married her second husband, Samuel Scranton who died in 2011. Mrs. Scranton was a member of Trinity Episcopal Church (Vero Beach). Mrs. Scranton was also a member of the Riomar Country Club (Vero Beach) and Coral Beach & Tennis Club (Bermuda). Mrs. Scranton is survived by her three children: Margaret Roberts Murphy, Charlottesville, VA.; Stuart O. Roberts, Steamboat Springs, CO; Donald H. Roberts, Jr., Philadelphia, PA; and by eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Memorial gifts may be sent to the Dwight-Englewood School 315 East Palisade Avenue Englewood, NJ 07631.

2014-04-21T00:00:00Z,"SCHMIDT--Marsha A.,passed away quietly on April 14, 2014 surrounded by family and friends after a brief illness caused by acute pulmonary distress following surgery recovery. Born on October 4, 1943 in Hackensack, NJ, Marsha graduated from Tenafly High School in 1961 and from Hood College in Frederick, Maryland in 1965 after making lifelong friends at both schools. She excelled at languages and earned several graduate level teaching certificates which enabled her to teach Spanish and coach non-English speaking visiting diplomats from the United Nations who were new to New York City. She also had a successful career in Marketing and held several executive positions at book publisher Doubleday and Company. It was at Doubleday where Marsha met John O'Donnell, whom she married and spent ten happy years before his death in 1993. Since his death Marsha split her time between New York City and Oakdale, Long Island and enjoyed the loyal companionship of college and career friends. She loved to travel to Europe and especially to Mexico where she had enjoyed many happy vacations with John. Marsha is survived by her father, Werner Schmidt, of Yarmouth Port, Massachusetts and her brother Paul and his wife Mary of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and three nephews who live in Chicago and Seattle. She will be sorely missed by them and by all her friends around the country. A memorial celebration of her life is being planned for later this spring. Marsha, as did John, had a passion for domestic animals and their welfare as well as for medical research to combat cancer. Donations in Marsha's memory may be made to the ASPCA or the New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell Medical Center."

2014-04-23T00:00:00Z,"WEISS--Neil, (July 21, 1933 - April 21, 2014) Beloved Husband, Father, Brother, Grandfather, Uncle and Dear Friend. Passed away peacefully while surrounded by family after an extended, purposefully private battle with cancer, one fought with strength, humility, courage, and conviction, dedication to family and dignity for himself, never allowing the ravages of his illness to prevent him from maintaining normalcy and hope in his life, being the unwavering family patriarch and consummate business person he always was. In true Neil Weiss fashion, tirelessly driven and steadfast, from the moment he learned of his fate, he chose not to go gently into that good night. Neil went about his life, going to his office everyday, challenging our family and inner-circle of advisors with ideas and expectations, attending meetings, shooting off emails and text messages, analyzing new deals and investment opportunities, taking calls, making calls, enjoying lunches, dinners and movies with family and friends, as he loved to do, and traveling the world. He continued to do it all, until he could no longer do it all. With a knack for seamlessly combining his personal and business lives onto one playing field, Neil applied a drive and passion for business in everything he did. He had a sensibility for knowing how to make things happen, albeit with great success and tenacity. An extraordinary role model to his children and grandchildren, his nieces and nephew, he enjoyed ""keeping score"" in his business dealings and investments as much as he did in his squash games, or the number of flights he would climb in his apartment building as part of his morning exercise routine. He stayed busy doing what he enjoyed doing... working hard, enjoying family, having fun, negotiating deals and playing with a certain degree of managed risk, always with a strong moral compass. Born and raised in the Bronx, he worked a short time early in his illustrious career for an established apparel manufacturer before deciding with unflappable confidence that he had the ability and ambition to do it better. The business grew, as did his business relationships and lasting personal friendships within the industry. Ever the pioneer, he was amongst the first in the industry to open offices in Hong Kong and the Dominican Republic, and manufacture private label for global luxury brands and retailers. It was also the pioneer in him that led to real estate investments in China and Hong Kong, in the late 70's after relations between the United States and China thawed. It was that same adventurous, enterprising, pioneering spirit that had him returning from trips in the early days to Asia with novel gifts, technologically-advanced gadgetry for family and friends, all precursors to today's cell phone. As his manufacturing business flourished, he continued to parlay his international business experience into a multitude of opportunistic ventures and partnerships, investing globally early in his career in commercial real estate in New York City and Asia, and more recently in New Orleans, as well as in Brazil with his dear friend and partner. He also had a penchant for complex alternative investments, all the while developing his own disciplined, self-taught investment skills that would often lead to returns that had many investment advisors in awe. In this regard, Neil viewed life as a game and business as a sport. He always made sure to have fun doing both. With an insatiable appetite for reading newspapers and sharing his knowledge with those he loved, he pushed us to do better, think with greater clarity and to experiment. He had a profound impact on all we did. A man of impeccable integrity and style, Neil took pleasure in every aspect of life, great and small. He was bold with his business deals. He had a huge heart and exceedingly generous spirit when it came to his family and friends. Decisive, direct, feisty, he was always his own man. Neil embraced life, family and business with an indomitable spirit, gusto, and boundless energy. He conducted his life with an abundance of love, wisdom, and wit. His legacy will live on in the many lives he touched throughout his industrious life, and he will be sorely and profoundly missed. Neil is pre-deceased by his eldest son Steven and survived by his faithful partner, the woman he adored and married more than 42 years ago, Virginia, his devoted children, Ken, Douglas and Elizabeth, his daughter-in-law, Jennifer (Ken), the grandchildren he so cherished, Roy, Gil, Stefan, Leila, Steven and Ava, and his sister who he so adored, Mal. He also leaves behind brother-in-law Murray, nieces Sandi and Lisa, and nephew Douglas, Noreen (fiancee to Douglas), Anthony (fiancee to Elizabeth), his COO and faithful friend Anna, Gus and Laling, as loyal and faithful as they come. A patron of the many arts in New York City, Neil was active in a wide range of philanthropic endeavors and worthy causes. A celebration of his life will be held on April 24th, 2014 at 11:30am at Frank E. Campbell The Funeral Chapel on Madison and 81st street. Donations can be made to Susan G. Komen (ww5.komen.org) and the Friars Foundation Wounded Warriors Program (friarsclub.com)."

The son of Herbert and Ella Beshar, Bob grew up in New Rochelle with his two brothers and sister. During his senior year at Yale University, Bob was appointed Scholar of the House and graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. While at Yale Law School, Bob met the love of his life, Christine von Wedemeyer. Christine was attending Smith College on a Fulbright. Bob and Christine were married in Germany in 1953. Late last year, they celebrated their 60th anniversary together with their four children -- Cornelia (Rob Spring), Jacky (Scot Jones), Fritz (Peter Lehner) and Peter (Sarah Beshar) -- and their fourteen grandchildren. Bob enjoyed a distinguished career in private practice. He also served in a number of government positions: Assistant General Counsel of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, law clerk for the Honorable Charles Breitel on the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director of the Bureau of International Commerce in Washington. After leaving the Commerce Department in 1972, Bob returned to New York to set up his own practice. Bob served as special counsel, then Corporate Secretary and, for almost thirty years, on the board of directors of National Semiconductor Corporation in Santa Clara, California. He was a member of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the Foundation Board of Westchester Community College and the Planning Board of the Town of Somers. In 1993, Bob became President of his family's rug and antiques business, Beshar's, in New York City. Bob's interests were varied and intense. A love of decorative arts -- bronzes, china, jewelry, clocks. He liked to say: ""the hand shapes the mind."" Reading novels late into the night -- convinced there was more truth in fiction than in non-fiction. Telling a great story over dinner and challenging children, grandchildren and startled guests to ""sing for their supper."" Driving, and carefully polishing, his convertible Mercedes with the license plate ""Besh"" -- his nickname at New Rochelle High School. Playing backgammon and eating Armenian food -- dolma, olives, cheoreg and lahmajoon. Trapshooting at Gipsy Trail with friends -- usually top gun and always wearing his trademark Stetson. Most of all, though, Bob adored his wife, his children and his grandchildren: Huyette, Peter, Alexander, Melissa, Vanessa, Lizi, Maddie, Scout, Nadine, Eliza, Marina, Isabel, Henry and Sophie. A service will be held at St. Luke's Church in Somers, New York on Saturday, April 26 at 11:00am, followed by a reception at the Stone House. The family has asked that those interested in honoring Bob's legacy consider a donation to Westchester Community College Foundation Hartford Hall, 75 Grasslands Road, Valhalla, New York 10595."

2014-04-24T00:00:00Z,"WEISS--Neil, (July 21, 1933 - April 21, 2014) Beloved Husband, Father, Brother, Grandfather, Uncle and Dear Friend. Passed away peacefully while surrounded by family after an extended, purposefully private battle with cancer, one fought with strength, humility, courage, and conviction, dedication to family and dignity for himself, never allowing the ravages of his illness to prevent him from maintaining normalcy and hope in his life, being the unwavering family patriarch and consummate business person he always was. In true Neil Weiss fashion, tirelessly driven and steadfast, from the moment he learned of his fate, he chose not to go gently into that good night. Neil went about his life, going to his office everyday, challenging our family and inner-circle of advisors with ideas and expectations, attending meetings, shooting off emails and text messages, analyzing new deals and investment opportunities, taking calls, making calls, enjoying lunches, dinners and movies with family and friends, as he loved to do, and traveling the world. He continued to do it all, until he could no longer do it all. With a knack for seamlessly combining his personal and business lives onto one playing field, Neil applied a drive and passion for business in everything he did. He had a sensibility for knowing how to make things happen, albeit with great success and tenacity. An extraordinary role model to his children and grandchildren, his nieces and nephew, he enjoyed ""keeping score"" in his business dealings and investments as much as he did in his squash games, or the number of flights he would climb in his apartment building as part of his morning exercise routine. He stayed busy doing what he enjoyed doing... working hard, enjoying family, having fun, negotiating deals and playing with a certain degree of managed risk, always with a strong moral compass. Born and raised in the Bronx, he worked a short time early in his illustrious career for an established apparel manufacturer before deciding with unflappable confidence that he had the ability and ambition to do it better. The business grew, as did his business relationships and lasting personal friendships within the industry. Ever the pioneer, he was amongst the first in the industry to open offices in Hong Kong and the Dominican Republic, and manufacture private label for global luxury brands and retailers. It was also the pioneer in him that led to real estate investments in China and Hong Kong, in the late 70's after relations between the United States and China thawed. It was that same adventurous, enterprising, pioneering spirit that had him returning from trips in the early days to Asia with novel gifts, technologically-advanced gadgetry for family and friends, all precursors to today's cell phone. As his manufacturing business flourished, he continued to parlay his international business experience into a multitude of opportunistic ventures and partnerships, investing globally early in his career in commercial real estate in New York City and Asia, and more recently in New Orleans, as well as in Brazil with his dear friend and partner. He also had a penchant for complex alternative investments, all the while developing his own disciplined, self-taught investment skills that would often lead to returns that had many investment advisors in awe. In this regard, Neil viewed life as a game and business as a sport. He always made sure to have fun doing both. With an insatiable appetite for reading newspapers and sharing his knowledge with those he loved, he pushed us to do better, think with greater clarity and to experiment. He had a profound impact on all we did. A man of impeccable integrity and style, Neil took pleasure in every aspect of life, great and small. He was bold with his business deals. He had a huge heart and exceedingly generous spirit when it came to his family and friends. Decisive, direct, feisty, he was always his own man. Neil embraced life, family and business with an indomitable spirit, gusto, and boundless energy. He conducted his life with an abundance of love, wisdom, and wit. His legacy will live on in the many lives he touched throughout his industrious life, and he will be sorely and profoundly missed. Neil is pre-deceased by his eldest son Steven and survived by his faithful partner, the woman he adored and married more than 42 years ago, Virginia, his devoted children, Ken, Douglas and Elizabeth, his daughter-in-law, Jennifer (Ken), the grandchildren he so cherished, Roy, Gil, Stefan, Leila, Steven and Ava, and his sister who he so adored, Mal. He also leaves behind brother-in-law Murray, nieces Sandi and Lisa, and nephew Douglas, Noreen (fiancee to Douglas), Anthony (fiancee to Elizabeth), his COO and faithful friend Anna, Gus and Laling, as loyal and faithful as they come. A patron of the many arts in New York City, Neil was active in a wide range of philanthropic endeavors and worthy causes. A celebration of his life will be held on April 24th, 2014 at 11:30am at Frank E. Campbell The Funeral Chapel on Madison and 81st street. Donations can be made to Susan G. Komen (ww5.komen.org) and the Friars Foundation Wounded Warriors Program (friarsclub.com)."

He was forever curious about the cosmos. He valued making good food in good company. Felix was born in Brooklyn and, even after decades in the San Francisco Bay Area, always considered himself a New Yorker. His life of activism was fuelled by a passion for peace and justice for all people. He was part of the anti-Vietnam War movement and an ally of Black Liberation and Puerto Rican independence. Felix maintained a decades-long commitment to supporting and freeing political prisoners like Marilyn Buck, Geronimo Pratt, Bashir Hameed, and the SF 8. They were among his closest friends and comrades. Felix fervently believed in the transformative power of people, both politically and personally. He brought this spirit into his work as a therapist, and continued his practice until the last days of his life. Felix never lost his dignity, his intellect or his sharp sense of humor. The last months of his life were marked by great tenderness and love. We will always remember his strength, his humanity and his capacity to think of others, even while facing his own death. We love you Felix. Memorial details: felixmemorial@gmail.com."

2014-04-27T00:00:00Z,"HAVEMEYER--Horace, III. Founder of Bellerophon Publications, publisher of Metropolis magazine and Metropolis Books, merging his lifelong interest in the breadth of architecture and design and in publishing and process. He was also a lifelong sailor, a natural teacher, and a talented, prolific watercolorist. Horace died March 19, 2014, at age 72, at home in New York from CIDP, a chronic neurological condition; he became quadriplegic in mid-2011. He is survived by his beloved and loving wife Eugenie Cowan Havemeyer; his mother Rosalind E. Havemeyer; his siblings Rosalind H. Roosevelt, William E. Havemeyer and Christian Havemeyer, and his uncle Harry W. Havemeyer. A 1964 graduate of Hobart and William Smith Colleges, in Geneva, New York, Horace served on the Board of Trustees from 1980-85 and 1991-97. He joined the family-owned National Sugar Refining Company in the Philadelphia factory, learning chemical processes, until the company was sold in 1969. He then began his publishing career in New York City as Production Planning Supervisor at Doubleday book publishers. There he learned editorial and business operations and nurtured his thirst for learning. Horace's intellectual and practical curiosity framed his vision for Metropolis: to ask and answer what, why and how, and to focus on collaborations and challenges in any project. Metropolis reaches beyond print: Its 1981 interactive conference ""Midtown: Testing the Zoning Proposal"" led to others; it was the initial sponsor of the International Contemporary Furniture Fair and sponsors competitions and educational tours. In 2009 the American Institute of Architects awarded Horace for Metropolis its Honor for Collaborative Achievement. ""Reaching a broad cross-section of design disciplines, touching all elements of design excellence,"" the citation read, ""it speaks to elemental and contextual innovation, including, but not limited to ecological insight, livability, and community development; in short, the spectrum of all goals of the architectural profession."" He was a co-founder and board member of Exploring the Metropolis, Inc., nonprofit organization led by his wife, Eugenie Cowan, that solves workspace issues facing New York's performing arts and cultural communities. A celebration of Horace's life and influences will be held May 2, 2014, 11:00am, at St. James' Church, Madison Avenue and 71st Street in Manhattan, reception following the service. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Horace's memory may be made to Exploring the Metropolis, Inc., 61 West 23rd Street, New York 10010, or to Hospital for Special Surgery: ALS Research, c/o Dr. Dale J.

Together they flew thousands of miles over the years. A veteran of WWII, Leo served four years in the USMC, attended flight school and earned his Aviation Navigator's wings. While stationed in Hawaii, he was Navigator in a B-25/PBJ on many flights in the Pacific to Midway, Johnston, Kwajelein, Guam, Wake, Okinawa; and to Shanghai, Tsing Tao, and Tientsin in China. In 1954 he opened Fagan's Restaurant on the banks of the Housatonic River in Stratford, CT, just upstream from the American Shakespeare Festival Theater. The restaurant became a great success, known for its fine dining and views over the water, and was frequented by actors, theater-goers, locals and food lovers from far and wide. After thirty-three years, the restaurant was sold in 1987 allowing Leo more time to fly, write and travel. He also loved to cook and to entertain friends at home for lunches and dinners. Leo is survived by his wife, Alanna, an artist; a daughter, Lynne, and a son, John, from his first marriage; Alanna's two sons, Charles D. and Daniel M. Lay; and two grandchildren.

2014-04-29T00:00:00Z,"FIELDS--Harry. Died on Monday April 28, 2014 at the age of 90. Born in Cologne, Germany, his family fled the rise of the Nazis for the Netherlands. They remained there until the war when they were taken and interned at Bergen Belsen concentration camp. Harry Fields, his father Isaac, mother Gisela, and brother, Alfred, miraculously survived the horrors of the camps as well as the notorious ""Lost Transport"" that followed their liberation. After earning a chemical engineering degree from the University of Amsterdam, he came to New York City in 1947 to work as a bottle washer for a small firm that later became the Fortune 500 company International Flavors and Fragrances. He worked at IFF for 44 years, and rose to serve as EVP of IFF Inc. and President of Flavors. In a life marked by equal measures of enormous strife and tremendous luck, his greatest good fortune was to have been married to Barbara Fields for 64 years. They raised two beloved children, Pamela and Michael, and he was equally devoted to his son-in-law Andrew, daughter-in-law Jessamyn, and grandchildren Daniel, Emma, and Willa. An accomplished linguist, he traveled to remote corners of the world and relished many adventures including Amazonian explorations, a submarine voyage to the Antarctic, and treks through the Borneo rainforest. He loved good bread and cheese, the sound of the violin and reading fine writing. An author late in life, his books include the wartime memoir ""Turbulent Times."" Harry Fields was knighted in 1996 by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands as an Officer in the Orde van Granje Nassau."

2014-05-04T00:00:00Z,"RIEHLMAN--Franklin E.,Art dealer Franklin Riehlman, the proprietor of Franklin Riehlman Fine Art, located at 24 East 73rd Street in New York City, passed away tragically on the evening of April 22 at the age of 61. To the unsuspecting, Franklin was known to identify himself as a used canvas salesman. In actuality, he was widely admired for his expansive knowledge in the field of 19th and 20th-century American art and his passion for early 20th-century art in general, including British modernism, and many other related fields. He was especially proud of his expertise in the work of the artists George Bellows, Clarence Carter, Konrad Cramer, Adolph Dehn, Charles Goeller, Leon Kroll, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Michael Lenson, Frank London, Edmund Lewandowski , Walter Murch, Priscilla Roberts, Harold Shapinsky and Hans Weingartner, along with many other artists of the early 20th-century, particularly those of the Woodstock Art colony. He was just as proud of his relationships with all who shared those interests. He also represented work of contemporary artists such as Leslie Gabosh, Walter Hatke, Robert Kipness, Simeon Lagodich, David Olenick, and Martin Weinstein. Franklin's prior lives included excelling as tight end/linebacker for the Pleasant Valley Vikings, induction into the Butte College Sports Hall of Fame as linebacker for the Butte College Roadrunners, a heavyweight wrestling champion, a painter of new canvases exhibited on both coasts, a student of art history at Hunter College, the Institute of Fine Arts and California State University at Chico, a scholar of ancient Greek vase painting, a salesman of LeRoy Nieman prints at Knoedler Publishing, Inc., a slide curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he was also a lecturer, a paintings expert at Phillips, Son & Neale, Inc. in New York, an associate at H.V. Allison Galleries, a business partner of Andrea Scully-Keogh and of Megan Moynihan, a published author of art historical catalogues and essays, a bridge player and a golf addict. He preferred research at the Frick Art Library to the internet and loved books. He was born in Safford, AZ and raised in Utah, Nevada, Santa Barbara, the California Bay Area, and Chico, CA, which he left for New York City in 1977. He is survived by his partner and lover of 30 years, Mary M. Walsh, of New York City, his mother Margaret Whitaker Riehlman, his siblings Mark (Liz), Troy (Mary Ann), Ann (Pat) Patterson and Donald, his uncle, Charles Whitaker, nieces and nephews and many, many friends and colleagues. All of whom are heartbroken and will cherish his memory. He was preceded in death by his father Peter and his nephew Josh. Franklin Riehlman Fine Art will continue as a company under the direction and ownership of Mary M. Walsh. A generous group of colleagues, friends and admirers are holding a memorial service to celebrate his life and compare tales on May 22 at the Lotos Club on 66th and 5th in Manhattan. Contact Franklin Riehlman Fine Art if you have not received an invite and wish to attend. A quote from one of Franklin's many pocket notebooks: ""Let us endeavor so to live that when we die, even the undertaker will be sorry."""
