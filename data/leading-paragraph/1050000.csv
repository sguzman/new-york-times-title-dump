The report apparently was based upon the appearance of Mr. Bennett's representatives at a recent meeting of the Board of Estimate to make objections to a new street map which affects the territory in question."

1903-12-27T00:00:00Z,To the Editor of The New York Times: The public is often apt to criticise unjustly a politician or statesman whose name happens to be before the people.

1903-12-27T00:00:00Z,"To The Editor of The New York Times: I was much interested in your editorial on Panama and Secession. In spite of your argument, it seems to me that the recognition of Panama is a recognition of the fact that secession is permissible when possible, and that the action of the United States at this time is in direct opposition to its avowed principles regarding the issues of the civil war."

Especially is this true when we recall the visit of Dowie and his Zionists to the ""unregenerate city.""

1903-12-27T00:00:00Z,"Wholly aside from the advantages which new streets may possess, as affording more direct lines of travel, the opening of them through built-up sections of the city is a matter of special interest to real estate men on account of the many peculiar bits of property usually developed in the process."

1903-12-27T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor of The New York Times: If the saying that ""the field is the world"" is true of anything it is true of labor and capital. There is no tariff on either, and in this age of steam and electricity all nations are neighbors and supply follows demand so rapidly that commerce has become a constantly turning kaleidoscope presenting a new view at every turn."
1903-12-27T00:00:00Z,"Just now this community seems to be suffering from an epidemic of attempted blackmail through the medium of threatening letters.

The tone of business, however, was strong, although professional, and markedly so among the specialties which were marked up on narrow dealings.

1904-01-01T00:00:00Z,"The elements of tragedy -- pity and fear -- are blended in the account of the destruction of the Iroquois Theatre in Chicago, and of the lives of so great a part of its holiday audience.

1904-01-02T00:00:00Z,"THIS book by Senator Beveridge is newspaper articles, and is distinguished by intelligent observation of the condition and drift of affairs in the Far East.

1904-01-02T00:00:00Z,"Beginning in the West and tending to the Waldorf-Astoria, this novel, in so far, is very much like a great many other novels. It is all about a sanguine, energetic Western man who made money in a California boom town, and immediately thereafter married a woman of the peony type and texture. The woman has a florid singing voice, but no particular heart."
1904-01-02T00:00:00Z,"Deep in the heart of the Maine forests two hunters discover tracks -- half panther half human, in the ground. Just what these tracks have to do with the Hermit is not quite clear, for they belong instead of to that half-witted, gentle old man, to a desperate criminal who has really nothing to do with the story.

1904-01-02T00:00:00Z,Mr. Kellogg's war study is a very technical account of the military operations in the Shenandoah Valley during the civil war. It is written purely from the soldier's standpoint and is devoid of historical or literary interest. The following extract will serve to indicate Mr. Kellogg's method of narration:
1904-01-02T00:00:00Z,"ALMOST all normally constituted boys delight to read of battles, and all boys who long to become acquainted with the history of the world they live in must study the history of its conflicts to know how to avoid such destructive and harrowing methods of settling international disputes."

1904-01-02T00:00:00Z,"It is perhaps not too much to say that a knowledge of a few simple rules of English grammar, or, if not of the rules, then of the practice of educated writers, should be assumed as antecedent to any attempt to write an English novel. A knowledge of several other things might, of course, be granted as desirable, but what we have named above appears to be an irreducible minimum of equipment."

1904-01-17T00:00:00Z,"In reading over the letters from correspondents published in your daily paper I find myself continually looking for some one who voices my own pet grievance -- being obliged to stand on ferryboats while a number of able-bodied men are comfortably seated in the women's cabin, where seats are ""specially reserved for ladies,"" as the framed notice reads."
1904-01-17T00:00:00Z,"The Baltimore Sun of Jan. 11 says that the following communication, addressed to a gentleman in Baltimore, makes a very interesting contribution to the political history of the civil war, to the effect that Gen.

S., Jan. 16. -- Buffeted by the seas of the North Atlantic most of the way from Ireland to Newfoundland, the German steamship Rhenania came into port to-day considerably the worse for wear.

The seas broke over the vessel constantly, and one of them went down a stokehole, extinguishing the fires."
1904-01-17T00:00:00Z,Mr. WILLIAM S. DEVERY will doubtless conclude that the world is more hollow and his doll more largely composed of sawdust than he had supposed when advised that the Housesmiths and Bridgemen's Union has relegated him to a place outside its membership and facilitated his departure by a process fairly comparable to that of kicking him down stairs.
1904-01-17T00:00:00Z,"The Roosevelt dynasty is evidently embarrassed by the aspects of its Panama case. The ""pacificatory"" statement issued by Mr. Roosevelt through Secretary Root and published yesterday is wheedling and threatening in the same breath. It ""roars like any sucking dove"" and blows ""hot air."" One astonishing thing in that statement is the assurance of ""service"" and ""help"" from us, which is intended to keep Colombians quiet."
1904-01-17T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Jan. 16. -- Six more churches were closed to-day by order of Building Commissioner Williams. At the same time one was allowed to open.

1904-01-17T00:00:00Z,"There has passed quite a gay week for a dud season. The larger entertainments, such as Mrs. Astor's ball and the cotillion given by Mrs. Ogden Mills, are more or less perfunctory, in the sense that they are annual occurrences. There was a great deal of misapprehension about Mrs. Astor's ball, and much that was merely fictitious was told of it. In the first place, there"

Prickitt, United States Consul at Rheims, France, in a recent report to the State Department says that Frenchmen of small incomes lay up money, though it is only possible for them to do so by self-denial and rigid economy. Mr. Prickitt gives figures which show in an interesting way how much more widely property is distributed in France than in England."

It was natural that in such a narrow market price fluctuations should be small, and except in isolated cases, including only a few active issues, the day's changes were confined to fractions."
1904-01-17T00:00:00Z,"There is no very good story that does not carry a moral. The story which a correspondent told in our columns yesterday was a very good one, setting forth how a friendly Indian brought a gift of a deer to the Pilgrim Fathers, and how the Pilgrim Fathers, ascertaining that he had killed the animal on Sunday, proceeded to give him flogging, after which they discussed and enjoyed his venison."
1904-01-17T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Jan. 16. -- The excessive apprehension prevailing in the best-informed quarters here that Russia's answer will precipitate war is based more upon knowledge of the attitude Russia has taken up during the previous phases of the controversy rather than on any definite information of Russia's intention under the present acute circumstances."

1904-01-31T00:00:00Z,"THAT Miss Annie Russell is anxious to escape from roles which brought her praise only for ""sweetness and charm"" has long been known, and that is, perhaps, why she elected to appear in ""The Younger Mrs. Parling.""
