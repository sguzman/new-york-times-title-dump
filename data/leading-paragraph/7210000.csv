The total concessions represented an 8 percent reduction in the salary and benefits package that its performers were scheduled to receive for the 2009-10 season.

In February, the band demanded that it be compensated by the Union for a Popular Movement, the party of President Nicolas Sarkozy, which used the MGMT song “Kids” at its national congress in January, as well as in two online videos and at a public function for the party leader, Xavier Bertrand. At the time, the party said the use of the song was an unintentional mistake, and offered the band one euro (approximately $1.32) in symbolic damages. But on Tuesday a lawyer for the band said that the party had agreed to pay a more substantial settlement; asked if the settlement was around $39,000, the lawyer told Reuters, “There has been an agreement of that order.”."

He deeply loved and was devoted to his wife of 67 years, Muriel, and his son, Douglas. The son of the late Maurice E. and Mary Barzelay, he was born and raised in Malden, Mass. He received a BSME from Northeastern University in 1939 and an MS from Harvard University in 1941. After serving as an aircraft designer during WWII, he joined the faculty of Syracuse University in 1947, becoming Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in 1953 until his retirement in 1978. During his tenure, his areas of interest included aircraft design, heat transfer and safety engineering, on which he acted as a consultant to NASA. He was a Visiting Professor at Harvard in 1963-64. After retiring from Syracuse University, he built an active and thriving consulting engineering practice, specializing in safety engineering and in accident analysis and reconstruction. He was the author of several treatises and numerous articles in his fields of expertise. For many years he was a leader of the reform movement in the Democratic Party in Syracuse and was active in statewide politics as well. He was also a highly accomplished painter and many of his works are in private collections around the country. Until his final illness, he also retained his keen interests in gardening and in the computer, a technology he embraced avidly in his 80s. He was fortunate to have lived a full, active and productive life, as he wished to live it, with his vibrant intellect and strong will intact and the welfare of his close-knit and loving family always uppermost in his mind.

2009-04-30T00:00:00Z,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the economy has continued to contract, though the pace of contraction appears to be somewhat slower. Household spending has shown signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Weak sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories, fixed investment and staffing. Although the economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting, partly reflecting some easing of financial market conditions, economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time. Nonetheless, the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability."

''You hear about people bracing themselves against the walls of their tent hoping it won't collapse or rip apart,'' said Annie Trujillo, right, a guide with Sierra Mountain Guides in Bishop, Calif. She said spring and summer are the seasons when this kind of tent, designed for use in the most extreme weather conditions, is taken to high peaks like Mount McKinley in Alaska and various mountains in the Himalayas, including K2. Ms. Trujillo tested five expedition tents in the strong winds of the High Sierras, assessing their sturdiness, durability and overall design. She gave highest marks to the Black Diamond tent for its ''drum tight'' structural integrity and and liked the Mountain Hardwear tent for its ''smart'' design. CHRISTOPHER PERCY COLLIER"

As can happen during such an exercise, visitors' artworks reflected their personal style: Chrissie Papciak (left) drew Kewpie-size versions of herself complete with corkscrew curls and jet-tinted cowcatcher lashes, while a young man in a bowler hat, who signed his work H. Crosthwaite (below), sketched portraits that might have come straight from the gaslight era. The effect was in keeping with Mr. Alan's vision.

2009-05-01T13:30:54Z,"As mixed-use propositions go, Mid-City Lanes, better known as the Rock ‘N’ Bowl, was a well-loved New Orleans oddity: a rock (and zydeco and funk) club in a working bowling alley in a dumpy strip mall. It had echoey bowling-alley acoustics, with strikes and spares crashing while the bands played, but it was a fun place. This month, it moved to a new, much bigger building of its own. The new Rock ‘N’ Bowl is a clean, surprisingly well-lighted place where the bar is big enough for women to stand on while twirling hula hoops. And someone actually considered acoustics; the high ceiling above the stage has sound-absorbent cushions, along with a disco ball, and the bowling alleys are further from the dance floor and, somehow, quieter. It’s so new that the ambiance is not particularly funky, but in New Orleans, that will change."

This November, Mr. Burke was scheduled to receive an honorary degree from the University of Stirling in Scotland, where he studied politics. But he has declined the degree after protests from the family of Mark Campbell, a fellow student whom Mr. Burke assaulted at the university about 20 years ago.

Almost to make the point, a few days ago the White House uploaded a bunch of photos of Barack Obama's first 100 days in office onto Flickr.

So is his dog, his wife, his staff, his daughters, his lawn, his aircraft and everything else touched by his good looking finger. But besides telling us that the White House is cool enough to use Flickr (it is), what does trawling the White House Flickr stream tell us about Barack the man?"

Elena is young -- in her late 40's -- and so could easily spend the next three or four decades on the bench. She's very smart (I knew her at Oxford when we were fellow students), and gets along with people. She navigated the egos at Harvard Law School, where she was dean, with aplomb, and Obama's appointment of her as Solicitor General suggests that he likes her legal sensibilities. There's also an element of justice in such an appointment, because Republicans blocked her appointment for a federal judgeship under Clinton -- for absurd reasons -- and so some would see it as her turn."

He graduated from The Peddie School in 1938 and entered Yale University as a member of the class of '42. In August 1940, he enlisted in the Naval Reserve and in September 1941 was sent to the South Pacific, where he participated in amphibious landings as boat group commander or Beachmaster at Guadalcanal, Rendova, Munda (where he was wounded in action), New Georgia and Bougainville. He was navigator of the U.S.S. President Adams during the invasion of Guam and became Executive Officer of the U.S.S. Alcyon. He left the Navy in 1945 at the age of 25 as a Lieutenant Commander, having been awarded the Bronze Star, with which he was entitled to wear four Combat Engagement Stars, and a Purple Heart. After the war, Mr. Gosnell resumed his studies at Yale and graduated with a B.A. He then returned to Rochester and joined The Lawyers Co-operative Publishing Company, which had been co-founded by his great-grandfather and became one of the largest publishers of legal and professional materials in the U.S. He served as President and CEO of this company from 1960 until its sale to the International Thomson Organization, Ltd., in 1989. Mr. Gosnell was an active leader and supporter of numerous civic and educational institutions. He served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Rochester Institute of Technology, which had been co-founded in 1885 by his great-grandfather, and was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1996. He also served on the boards of the Allendale Columbia School, Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, Strong Memorial Hospital, Nantucket Cottage Hospital and United Way of Rochester. Mr. Gosnell was known for his support of many initiatives to improve downtown Rochester, including the return of the famous copper statue of the winged-footed Mercury. A strong believer in land conservation, Mr. Gosnell was a benefactor of and served on the board of the Nantucket Conservation Foundation.

He was singing with a huge, swooping voice and whipping up crowd participation. To his left were two tambourine-equipped backup singers, also in white. To his right was half a brass band — trombone, sousaphone, two trumpets — and a gospel band, with piano and organ, all oom-pahing a second-line beat behind the songs Andrews was belting with preacherly passion."

As her band played a modal vamp, she sweetly requested, “Will you sing with me? Please?” Then she divided the audience into three groups and proceeded to unveil prospective parts: quick scat syllables in arpeggiated lines that went on, and on, and on. “You got it, right?” she said. Much later, after breezing through a complex composition with a Latin lilt and a lot more blithe scat-singing, she called for that singalong, getting the expected silence and laughter. But instead of leaving the audience feeling inadequate, she offered a part that was brief enough to remember — but which might have sounded too tricky earlier. The singalong was instant and spirited — and so was the standing ovation that followed her set."

I also supported the migration from ""simulated drowning"" to ""near drowning"" when describing waterboarding.But I would like to suggest that even ""near drowning"" doesn't really describe the reason why waterboarding is torture. I offer for your consideration the following short description of why waterboarding is undeniably torture:It's not the physical discomfort of being strapped down and having water pour on you that makes waterboarding torture. It's not the ""simulation"" of drowning that makes waterboarding torture. It's the threat of imminent death - that's what makes waterboarding torture.Can you put a noose around someone's neck and threaten to kick the chair out from under him if he doesn't answer your questions? No, that's torture.Can you attach electrodes to a person and threaten to electrocute him if he doesn't answer your questions? No, that's torture.Can you hold a gun to someone's head and threaten to blow his brains out if he doesn't answer your questions? No, that's torture.Can you strap someone to a board and threaten to drown him if he doesn't answer your questions? No, that's torture.Can you explain why our elected and appointed officials cannot understand this?Peter BauerSouth Bend, Ind., April 26, 2009"

The police said several robbers had threatened a guard at the Scheringa Museum for Realism in Spanbroek with a gun before making off with two paintings. No one was injured, they said. The robbers took &#8220;Adolescence,&#8221; a 1941 gouache by Dal&#237;, and &#8220;La Muscienne,&#8221; an oil painting from 1929 by the Polish-born Art Deco painter Tamara de Lempicka, the museum said in a statement.

The Dal&#237; painting is 18 by 12 inches, and the de Lempicka work is 46 by 29 inches. &#8220;We deeply regret the theft and hope the works are traced soon,&#8221; said a statement from the museum, which is 30 miles north of Amsterdam. The Dal&#237; painting shows a landscape in which a woman&#8217;s face can be seen: her lips and nose are formed by the back of a seated woman, and her eyes are part of two hills in the background. The de Lempicka shows a woman in a vivid blue dress playing a mandolinlike instrument."

Ms. Duffy, 53, is known for using a deceptively simple style to produce accessible, often mischievous poems dealing with the darkest turmoil and the lightest minutiae of everyday life. In her most popular collection, ''The World's Wife'' (1999), overlooked women in history and mythology get the chance to tell their side of the story, so that one poem imagines, for instance, the relief that Mrs. Rip Van Winkle must have felt when her husband fell asleep, finally giving her some time for herself."

Souter as an opportunity to regroup after a series of political setbacks. Even as Mr. Souter delivered a letter to the White House formally disclosing his intention to step down at the end of this term, liberal and conservative leaders prepared for another of the intense battles over Supreme Court appointments that have marked the past 20 years in Washington. Mr. Souter -- though appointed by a Republican, the first President George Bush -- has been a part of the liberal bloc of the court, so Mr. Obama's appointment is unlikely to shift the ideological makeup of the court."

The police said several robbers had threatened a guard at the Scheringa Museum for Realism in Spanbroek with a gun before making off with two paintings. No one was injured, they said. The robbers took ''Adolescence,'' a 1941 gouache by Dalí, and ''La Muscienne,'' an oil painting from 1929 by the Polish-born Art Deco painter Tamara de Lempicka, the museum said in a statement. The paintings' value was not released, but museum officials said they were among the top works in its collection. The Dalí painting is 18 by 12 inches, and the de Lempicka work is 46 by 29 inches. ''We deeply regret the theft and hope the works are traced soon,'' said a statement from the museum, which is 30 miles north of Amsterdam. The Dalí painting shows a landscape in which a woman's face can be seen: her lips and nose are formed by the back of a seated woman, and her eyes are part of two hills in the background. The de Lempicka shows a woman in a vivid blue dress playing a mandolinlike instrument."

''I lived in the West Village for 32 years, on Bank Street for 21. Now I garden, I have chickens and I make olive oil. It's been seven years now -- or eight years, how time goes. Each year you feel more a part of the country you're in. When I go back, I find it harder and harder to understand what I saw in living in a big city where the values are so different. Here it's not all about money. It's more about family and friends. Linda was my twin daughters' piano teacher when they were 5 years old; she now lives in a town on the other side of the mountains six months a year. We've been talking about Sicily for at least four years. It was very rustic, old-fashioned Italy from the movies: you go through small, dusty town after dusty town, with people still farming. In this photo, I'm probably pointing at the capers. One thing I do when I travel is take little pieces of plants and then try to root them in my garden. I ended up taking a bit of caper but it didn't do too well; I think it's just not dry enough in Tuscany.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

It ended up selling for $2.4 million, well above its high $1.8 million estimate. While his work never appealed to the Japanese who were responsible for the 1980s art boom or to the hedge fund billionaires or newly rich Russians who pushed prices in the last few years, it has, for the most part, been snapped up by low-key, seasoned collectors."

2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Alexander Korda's 1941 film ''That Hamilton Woman,'' based on the scandalous real-life love affair between the British naval legend Adm. Horatio Nelson and Emma Hamilton -- played by the real-life husband-and-wife Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh -- uses a framing device that's lovely if somewhat painful: An impoverished and prematurely aged Emma is arrested for stealing a bottle of wine and locked in a jail cell. Her chatty cellmate cheerfully asks first for her name and then for her story: ''Tell us all about it -- doesn't matter if it's true or not.'' What follows, unfolding in the glowing terms of an older woman's reminiscence -- or maybe just the glowing terms of classical moviemaking -- is the story of how the youthful and extraordinarily beautiful Emma captured the heart of the stolid war hero and began an affair that would last until his heroic death at sea in 1805. Olivier, as great an actor as he was, gives the lesser performance here. It's Leigh (above) who captivates, playing a character just as flirty, though not as flinty, as the one who had made her famous a few years earlier, Scarlett O'Hara. Emma has more layers of melancholy, and of generosity, than Scarlett does, and Leigh brings those finer shadings to the fore. With her creamy bisque complexion and laughing feline eyes, Leigh as Emma is radiant to an almost unearthly degree. That's what gives the film's framing device its mournful sting: The movie's vision of the older, broken Emma Hamilton offers a glimpse into Leigh's own unhappy future. Though she did have a few more notable film roles (including that of Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' in 1951), she suffered from bipolar disorder and worked infrequently until her death in 1967. But in ''That Hamilton Woman'' she's bracingly alive, as she and her husband embroider history in gilt thread. Doesn't matter if it's true or not.

But for Randy Sturrock and Marianne Edwards, a Canadian couple in their late 50s, the RV is their preferred mode of inexpensive transportation. In 2000, the couple set off on their first adventure, a year-long trek from their home in northern Ontario down through the Dakotas to Utah, Texas, California and Arizona. Along the way, they discovered that not only did they love the experience of the RV, but how much it saved them in travel costs. Since then, they've taken three, five-month RV trips, and now provide money-saving guidance to RV newbies via their Web site, frugal-rv-travel.com.

2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"KENNEDY--Yvonne Lawrence, 81, of Fairfield, CT died suddenly on April 27, surrounded by her children who adored her. A native New Yorker, she was ""just visiting"" Fairfield for sixty years. She was an elegant and extraordinary woman whose like will not pass this way again. Her deep and abiding faith sustained her and inspired not only her husband, eight children and twelve grandchildren, but so many she loved of every faith. She truly lived the principles of faith, hope and charity. She was the daughter of Joseph W. Lawrence and Alice M. Gallagher but largely raised after her father's death by a legendary grandmother, Mimi Gallagher, whom she emulated all her life. She arrived into adulthood with a rare mix of worldliness and humility. She looked the whole world in the eye, cared not about status or the bubble of reputation, and was generous to all, with her time, her spirit and her love. Loyal and funny, she was a larger-than-life personality that all were drawn to, yet was amazingly unaware of the deep and positive effect she had on others. Her brilliant and incisive mind encompassed many disciplines. She enjoyed challenging herself and broadening her intellectual horizons through reading and debating issues with many. She was known to read a book in a day and without fail, the New York Times and Wall Street Journal before starting her day. Her favorite hours were spent in the ""booth"" on the ""ameche"". She was the beating heart of the home she created and it was a large one, encompassing her children, an extended family and hosts of friends, who all loved to be around her. The door of her home on Sachem Road was always open. Unless, of course, she was out on the open road in the YLK-mobile, with a bucket of Kentucky Fried. A stalwart friend to many, and always ready to lend a hand, no friendship could compare with that she shared with Rosemary Barry. Together, they weathered lifes vicissitudes, its triumphs and tragedies, across six decades. A devoted wife of the late John M. Kennedy, she was an amazing mother to all her children: Anne K. Gargano (Joseph), John M. Kennedy, Jr. (Eileen), the late Martin J. Kennedy (Carol), Deane O. Kennedy (Kathleen), the late Lizzy Kennedy, Cornelia K. Suskind (Ron), Alice E. Kennedy (Dan), Marita K. Wein (Bryon). But it was her grandchildren that truly made those beautiful blue eyes sparkle the brightest: Jay and Meghan Gargano, John III and Sarah Kennedy, Brian and Grace Kennedy, Walter and Owen Suskind, Amanda Lange and Matthew, Laura and Julia Wein. She is also survived by her devoted and loving sister, Cornelia L. Smith (""Dickie"") and siblings Joseph W. Lawrence, Michael P. Montesani, Diane M. Wenk, and Jeanette M. Curran. She was predeceased by her sister, Alice Murray Larson and brothers Joseph T. Montesani and Peter Montesani. A Memorial Mass in Celebration of her Life will take place on Saturday, May 16 at 1:30pm at St. Augustine's Cathedral, 359 Washington Ave., Bridgeport, CT. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the foundation that has been set up in her memory: A Friend in Need Foundation, 6370 31st Pl. NW, Wash DC 20015."

2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"OUTPOSTS President Obama is making it safe to be a liberal again -- and showing how meaningless such labels can be. His first lap reveals not so much about him as it does the country he governs: a nation willing to follow a man whose policies they may not fully believe in. Obama's broad support points to an old American character trait -- pragmatism. It can tilt conservative or liberal, as resilient as the times. We are said to be a center-right country. In truth, we lean to common sense. If that means tying up the banks in ropes of new regulation to keep them from running amok again, despite cries about restraining free enterprise, most people are for it.

2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"I Want Revenge, the morning-line Kentucky Derby favorite, was scratched from the 135th running of the race Saturday after veterinarians detected lameness in his left front ankle. I Want Revenge, a son of Stephen Got Even, will probably miss the Preakness Stakes, too, his trainer, Jeff Mullins, said. It was a stunning development on par with the race-morning withdrawal in 1992 of another favorite, A. P. Indy, who is I Want Revenge's grand sire. Mullins and two veterinarians who examined I Want Revenge were not certain what was ailing him."

2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Jeremy Renner has some memorable good guys on his résumé, most notably the young fireman suffering from depression in ''Twelve and Holding.'' But he is best known for creepy triumphs like Charlize Theron's vicious enemy in ''North Country'' and the chillingly affectless serial killer in ''Dahmer.'' That sort of gift can trap an actor, but if so, Kathryn Bigelow's suspenseful Iraq war movie, ''The Hurt Locker'' (June 26), should spring Mr. Renner once and for all. Not that his Staff Sgt. William James is just one of the boys. His specialty is disarming the improvised explosive devices -- I.E.D.'s -- that have become the chief killers of troops and civilians. The work is beyond dangerous, but as Mr. Renner plays him, Sergeant James is an enthusiast for this loaded version of Russian roulette. Decked out in his bulky protective gear and formidable helmet, he bounces toward his deadly target like an astronaut on the moon about to discover something wonderful. James's enthusiasm unnerves and infuriates another sergeant (Anthony Mackie), whose task it is to guide and protect him via remote control, and when a younger soldier accuses him of putting them all at risk for an adrenaline high, we see his point. As Mr. Renner plays him, James at first seems like your basic hot dog, flashy and fearless. Certainly he savors his skill at locating and teasing apart the lethal components of the I.E.D.'s; he's dicing with death. But as the story progresses, Mr. Renner gives James a fascinating complexity of macho intensity and guarded tenderness, as well as sly humor and -- surprising in someone who takes a certain pleasure in the discomfort of other men -- a hatred of human cruelty."
2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"It's hard enough for bettors to focus on a 50-1 shot like Mine That Bird. ''Who's that horse?'' is a common refrain when a long shot enters the picture. But for a race caller who must keep track of 19 horses, the job is doubly difficult. Tom Durkin, who called the Kentucky Derby for NBC, appeared to lose sight of Mine That Bird's dramatic move around the far turn and in the homestretch of the Derby, when the winner slipped past Join in the Dance to seize control of the race."
2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"The Belgian-born actress Yolande Moreau has enjoyed a 30-year career in French theater and film but remains virtually unknown in the United States. That may change for art house audiences with her extraordinary performance in the difficult title role of ''Séraphine'' (June 5), which dominated the 2009 Césars, France's version of the Oscars, with seven awards, including best actress for Ms. Moreau. The movie covers the later years in the life of Séraphine de Senlis, a deeply devout, middle-aged provincial cleaning woman who, at the behest of her guardian angel, became a recognized outsider artist before dying at 78 in a mental hospital in 1942. Playing a character who in an earlier era might have been seen as a saint and in ours as bipolar or schizophrenic presents a double challenge. Ms. Moreau meets it with a largely physical performance that is as subtle as it is vigorous."
2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"In the world of stand-up, Zach Galifianakis is a meta comic who takes showbiz conventions and gives them an absurdist twist. Judging by the videos on his Web site (zachgalifianakis.com), his impersonations don't feature the famous, but rather characters like ''the lisping gay-basher'' and ''the timid pimp.'' And in ''Between Two Ferns,'' his sendup of local-access television talk shows, he's the worst host in the world, interviewing real guests who don't always seem in on the joke. With ''The Hangover'' (June 5), Mr. Galifianakis has his first major role in a high-profile comedy, and he's terrific, but there's nothing meta about it. On the contrary, he inhabits his ridiculous character with such sincerity that he nearly steals the movie. In ''The Hangover,'' three groomsmen take their about-to-be-married buddy to Las Vegas for a last bachelor spree and manage to lose him in the course of a particularly wild night. Two of the men are the groom's close friends; the third, played by Mr. Galifianakis, is the bride's eccentric brother, Alan. Round-bellied, socially inept and not the least bit shy about walking around without any pants on, he's the wackiest of the movie's characters; the others have their comic opportunities, but they're straight men by comparison. He also has many of the movie's broadest moments: being sucker-punched by Mike Tyson; stumbling blearily into the bathroom only to realize too late that there's a very annoyed tiger in there with him."

2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Think of Boston and images of genteel, picturesque beauty come to mind: swan boats gliding across the pond at the Public Garden, a Paul Revere statue nobly silhouetted against the sky. There's none of that in Peter Yates's cold, damp and piercing modern noir from 1973, ''The Friends of Eddie Coyle.'' Its chief visual feature is the sad-eyed, beaten-down mug of the low-level hood Eddie, played by Robert Mitchum. But that's enough. Eddie, desperately trying to avoid a jail sentence, feeds some information on stolen guns to the feds, even as he is helping a crew of bank robbers -- people he counts among his ''friends'' -- obtain firearms for their next job. This is a world in which underworld gun dealers tote their merchandise in paper bags from Stop & Shop, and in which the sympathetic guy behind the bar (in this case played by Peter Boyle) really isn't your best friend."

2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Manhattan. In July. The heat emanating from the sidewalk. The stench emanating from every nook and cranny of the sweltering town. How I yearned, during the summers I lived in New York, to just get out of that overheated, overanxious city every once in a while, to meander aimlessly along an esplanade in some quiet seaside spot, the gentle breeze ruffling the hair at the back of my neck. Woody Allen's ''Stardust Memories'' provides the quintessential backdrop for a New Yorker's escapist fantasies: a sleepy little film festival at the shore, where the besieged filmmaker Sandy Bates has been invited to attend a retrospective of his work. Although the soothing qualities of the place are not immediately accessible to our hero, once he does manage to give his swarming, rabid fans the slip, you can practically taste the salt in the air and hear the lapping of the waves in the middle distance."

2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"I was about 6 years old when I fell in love for the first time. The girl I sighed for was at least five years older, she had beautiful brown eyes, and she was completely out of reach. But I managed to get as many secret dates with her as I could, sitting in the warm darkness of a movie theater while she glowed on the screen, larger than life. Her name was Melody (Tracy Hyde) and she was in love -- oh, poor me! -- with Daniel (Mark Lester), whom I both admired and despised because I so much wanted to be him. Our dating continued years later, on television, our love intact. Then I lost her for many years. Set in London, ''Melody'' -- directed by Waris Hussein and written by Alan Parker -- is probably the film that I've seen most often. Though it was released in the United States in March, I think I saw it in Mexico in the summer, or maybe it's just that I associate London's raininess with Mexico City's wet summers. It was one of my first lessons about transgression: two kids in love take their own vows of marriage, beating all adult authority against them. Freedom, innocence, love: all signs of that era. Every time I fall in love, I look fruitlessly for Melody in the other person, just as every time I'm having fun with a friend I feel as if I'm Daniel fooling around with his friend Ornshaw in the streets while the Bee Gees sing ''Give Your Best.'' Yes, I know: corny. But true."

2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"BRETON shirts, the traditional blue-and-white striped tops, introduced into the uniform of French seamen in 1858, have a way of showing up each spring, both on the runway and off. ''Every year, we put them out,'' said Seth Weisser, an owner of the SoHo vintage store What Comes Around Goes Around. ''And the people who get them, buy them, and those people tend to have great style.'' This season, however, it looks like Fleet Week in certain parts of town. Perhaps the appearance of a big-shouldered Breton top with sequins on Balmain's fall runway (left) is the reason. Or, possibly, it's Gwyneth. ''The classic French T-shirt always looks right in spring year after year,'' Ms. Paltrow recently wrote on Goop, her occasionally enlightening lifestyle Web site. She then recommended buying one from Saint James, a French company with a store on Madison Avenue. It's ''as authentic as it comes,'' she wrote. And only $65."
2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"In the summer of 1985 I played a small part or, I should say, I was a small actor in a movie called ''Heartburn.'' Written by Nora Ephron, it stars the beautiful Meryl Streep and the irresistible Jack Nicholson as a couple whose great romance leads them to a marriage that doesn't last. Their best friends are played by Stockard Channing, Richard Masur, Milos Forman and ... me. We were gathered together in the deep summer heat of New York City by Mike Nichols, our very cool director. As a perspiring young actress from Toronto, my self-consciousness was, mercifully, overwhelmed by my gratitude for being in such good company. I expected Ms. Streep to be unapproachable on set. But, no. Never again could I suffer foolish actors who burden themselves and others with the weight of their craft after watching Ms. Streep's lighthearted but sure-footed dance between her tormented character and herself, the fun-loving actress. Oh, right, it's called acting, not feeling."

2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"''Galaxy Quest'' was released in theaters in December 1999, along with the usual Christmas-season prestige pictures (among them ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'') and star vehicles (the Tom Hanks-driven ''Green Mile''). At the time, this seemingly dismissible comedy about actors from a long-canceled ''Star Trek''-like television show who are beamed into a for-real space adventure nearly became lost in the shuffle. But this clever and openhearted picture (directed by Dean Parisot) eventually found its audience on television and DVD. The flashy Christmas releases may have seemed important at the time, but 10 years later it's a movie like ''Galaxy Quest'' that you remember. Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tim Allen and Tony Shalhoub (below) play washed-up actors forced to relive their glory days as the stars of a silly old sci-fi series. The only work they can get requires that they dress up in character and show up at sci-fi conferences and promotional events, where they're invariably greeted by wide-eyed fans dressed in elaborate get-ups. One day they're approached by an especially enthusiastic bunch, with hair that looks like patent leather and sleek one-piece uniforms to match. These exceedingly polite but socially awkward individuals turn out to be real-life aliens known as Thermians, and not only have they been watching the show faithfully for eons, they've also modeled their civilization on it. (They refer to the episodes as ''historical documents.'')"

You know, the original '55 Chrysler 300, the muscle-era Super Bees, Road Runners, Charger Daytonas and Hemi 'Cudas. But that was never what Chrysler was about. Chrysler has always been at its best when it made cars for buyers who appreciate a good plastic pocket protector. The Chrysler Corporation could never afford to match General Motors or Ford engineering dollar for engineering dollar. Chryslers, DeSotos, Dodges and Plymouths were, most of the time, the plain brown wrappers of the American auto industry, stripped-down transportation for the value conscious and fleet buyers. The heart of the market for Chrysler was always vehicles like the Plymouth Savoy, Dodge Dart and Chrysler Windsor. They were ordinary cars that few people bothered to collect, but which did yeoman duty as family haulers, taxicabs and police cars."

2009-05-03T00:00:00Z,"MADRID One of France's most radical 19th-century artists is riling up this city in an exhibition at the CaixaForum (Paseo del Prado, 36; 34-902-223-040), ''Maurice de Vlaminck: A Fauve Instinct, Paintings From 1900-1915,'' on view through June 6. With some 80 canvases, as well as a selection of ceramics, the exhibition offers the first retrospective held in Spain of the work of Vlaminck (1876-1958), the painter who once compared his career in painting to ''throwing a bomb.'' He continued: ''That way I have satisfied my desire to destroy, to disobey, and to recreate a sensitive, living, free world.'' Vlaminck was among the pioneering artists of his generation to see painting as something bold and visceral as opposed to refined and delicate. At the 1905 Salon d'Automne, Vlaminck and the artists with whom his work was shown -- Matisse, Derain, van Dongen, and Manguin -- were disparaged by the French critics as wild beasts, ''les fauves,'' for their daring use of color. As so often happens with criticism, that pejorative term stuck as the name of one of modern art's most beloved movements. -- Andrew Ferren"

There are a few genres missing — gospel, hip-hop, jazz, country, bluegrass — but it’s still quite the portmanteau.

2009-05-04T12:00:25Z,"The chief justice of Malawi’s Supreme Court adjourned a hearing on Monday in which a lawyer for Madonna continued to press the pop star’s efforts to adopt a second child from that African country, Agence France-Presse reported. Chief Justice Lovemore Munro said he would rule at a later date on Madonna’s appeal of a lower court’s decision to deny her adoption request. In April, Judge Esme Chombo of Malawi’s High Court rejected Madonna’s proposed adoption of a 3-year-old girl named Chifundo James because the singer had not resided in that country for at least 18 months, as required by law. Madonna did not appear at the hearing on Monday, at which the Supreme Court heard presentations from her lawyer, Alan Chinula, and a rights group opposing the adoption.

Over the weekend, Mr. Reznor published an e-mail message he received from Apple’s iPhone developer group at his official Web site, nin.com.

On his Web site, Mr. Reznor wrote that though he loved Apple products, he urged the company to “think your policies through.” In a subsequent post, Mr. Reznor wrote that he had removed the song “The Downward Spiral” from his servers but had not heard from Apple if this was an acceptable solution.

Though she refused to socialize with leading party members, and rumors persist that she was actually a Communist spy, Leander nevertheless became a tool of the German propaganda machine, entertaining troops and civilians alike while the country slipped ever further into self-created ruin. (Leander would later repeatedly claim to have been a ""political idiot."") It's more than a little ironic then that in 1983, the campy anarchist Nina Hagen, who was ""dishonorably discharged"" from the Free German Youth group at age 12, recorded one of Leander's most famous songs, ""Ich weiss es wird einmal ein Wunder geschehn"" (""I Know One Day a Miracle Will Happen""), a song often believed to be a plea to persevere in time of war.

Triple-Threat Producer/Singer/Actor, Stephen Craig Hayes aka Steve Gideon of West Hollywood, California passed away on May 1, 2009, after an arduous battle with cancer that he fought with courage, humor and song. Stephen Hayes grew up in Virginia and North Carolina, where his love for theater began when he was just a boy. He went on to graduate from Harvard University and The Boston Conservatory of Music, before embarking on a career in musical theater. Steve gained national attention as one of the original cast members of the world-wide theatrical sensation Naked Boys Singing. In 1999, Hayes made theater history by securing permission to stage (and star in) the first same-sex production of Stephen Sondheim's Marry Me a Little which The Hollywood Reporter described as ""a thoughtful, touching and charming show that attains all of the complexities of the essential early Sondheim"", Hayes' other credits include Nite Club Confidential, for which he appeared in productions in New York, Boston, Long Beach and Los Angelos (where he appeared alongside Scott Bakula in a record-breaking run) and the musical revue All Night Strut. In the 1990's Steve released his first CD ""Feels Like Home"", with two original compositions, and was working on a new album, The Happening, based on music from his recent cabaret show of the same name. While Steve has appeared in countless cabaret shows, he also donated his talents to appear in shows such as Annie Get Your Chip and Beach Blanket Boozer, benefits for the West Hollywood Recovery Center. He is survived by his long time companion Bernard Vyzga of West Hollywood, CA, his father Luby Hayes (of Denver, NC), his sister Pam Poole (of Richmond, VA), his brother Ronald Hayes (of Gainesville, FL), as well as his beloved Dachshund LP, and many, many close friends and fans.

2009-05-05T00:00:00Z,"SPITZER M. James ""Jimmy,"" 97 (almost 98) died peacefully on May 4, 2009 at the home of his son surrounded by all of his family who admired and loved him, his sons, daughters-in-law, grandchildren and great-grandchild. He was ill for only a brief time, living life fully up to the very end reading to improve his mind, debating politics, playing golf and cherishing his many friendships. He was born in New York City and resided in Purchase, NY and Longboat Key, FL. His wife and partner in life predeceased him 11 years ago, but his love and devotion to her never ended. After graduating from Evander Childs High School at the age of 16, he attended Fordham University and Fordham Law School at night graduating in four short years at the age of 20 in the Class of 1932. He maintained a close relationship with the University always grateful for the education he received and the opportunities it afforded him and he took full advantage of them. Fordham has recognized his achievements and honored him for his many accomplishments. When he started college, he began working as an office boy at the Offices of Charles Strauss to enable him both to pay for his education and to provide support for his mother and father, Minnie and Pop. That was the beginning of a career that spanned 77 rewarding years, all with the same law firm. He became its senior partner and it became Spitzer & Feldman. Throughout his long career, he unwaveringly adhered to the highest standards of ethics and of service to his clients. He was the quintessential advocate for his clients and for his friends and they were equally committed to him. He was a role model and mentor to the lawyers who worked with him at the firm including his son Jim who joined him in 1970. He was proud of their relationship as colleagues and partners as well as father and son. As dedicated as he was to his work, his first priority was always his family. He was a devoted and dutiful son supporting his family from the time he graduated Evander Childs High School. His older brother, Arthur, whom he idolized died at only 16 and it was a loss Jimmy always mourned. Through one of his many friends he met the beacon of his life Irma Louise Spitzer of Montgomery, Alabama and in 1938 they married. Their romance was forever, a fairy tale of enduring love, mutual respect and total commitment. He was a loving and always proud father, demanding but fair; he became the mentor and best friend to his two sons, M. James of Manhattan and Thomas Neil of Portland Oregon who are forever grateful for the joy and guidance their Dad bestowed for all these years. No less was his love for his daughters-in-law (he regarded them as daughters) Sheri Lagin and Mardi Schnitzer Spitzer. He was smitten with, admired and adored his three granddaughters, Ashley Fagan, Jessica Spitzer and Jamie Spitzer and he was proud of all of their considerable accomplishments. He was generous to them in every way, providing advice when asked, an ear to listen when needed and emotional support and love always. He brought joy to and enriched their lives. He made them laugh, he told them stories of growing up in a different age and he encouraged them to pursue their dreams and to fulfill their goals and he assisted them in every way possible. His three granddaughters knew how special he was and how lucky they were. They spoke with him daily often expressing their love, asking for advice or just laughing, kidding and tormenting him. Most recently he became a great-grandfather of Cameron Fagan, Ashley's son and he was overwhelmed by re-experiencing the wonders of life. The joy he experienced immediately after Cameron's birth in holding and bathing Cameron was a cherished milestone in a life which spanned six generations and was lived to its fullest. Jimmy loved life and those he encountered along the way including not only his peers and contemporaries, but making friends with people of all ages and from all walks of life. He always had stories to tell and jokes to share, advice to give, and a willingness to listen. He was passionate about playing golf and was a member of the Quaker Ridge Golf Club in Scarsdale and the Longboat Key Club in Florida. His golfing buddies were his best friends. He was an avid reader of biographies and history, mainly American, always striving to improve his mind. He followed political events closely and was always ready for a spirited discussion. Most of all, his generosity, his joy of life, his humor, his laughter, his openness, his intellect, his respect for others, his belief in what each of us can accomplish attracted friends wherever he went. People wanted to be with him, to listen and to talk and he fully enjoyed the company of each of them and their times together. He was a remarkable man who embraced life with an unbounded optimism for what tomorrow will bring. In his multitude of roles, son, husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, counselor, advocate, friend, he will be missed and admired forever and forever. Services will be at 9:30am Wednesday, May 6 at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York, NY. 212-362-6600. Contributions in the memory of M. James Spitzer may be made to Fordham University School of Law, 140 West 62nd Street, New York, NY 10023."

He fought an admirable and courageous seven month battle against esophageal cancer. We welcomed him into our large extended family after his marriage to Grace. He was a brilliant lawyer, a loving and fun husband, remarkable father, and wonderful uncle and friend. He loved to take his sons on wilderness adventure trips fishing, skiing and rafting. He and Grace went on countless trips around the world on foot, bicycle, boat, skis and just for pleasure. Together they enjoyed the company of many friends with whom they shared the cultural life of the City and the beauty of the mountains and ocean. He had many passions: the NY Yankees, animal welfare -- personified by his beloved dog, Charlie -- movies, books and tennis. He was particularly blessed with a superb sense of humor and could make a joke or story sing. He enjoyed life to the fullest, loved a good party, was reliable, intelligent, honest, kind and thoughtful. A service for Jack will be held at the All Soul's Church, 1157 Lexington Avenue on May 6, at 11 am with a viewing in the Chapel beginning at 10:30am.

That was the beginning of a career that spanned 77 rewarding years, all with the same law firm. He became its senior partner and it became Spitzer & Feldman. Throughout his long career, he unwaveringly adhered to the highest standards of ethics and of service to his clients. He was the quintessential advocate for his clients and for his friends and they were equally committed to him. He was a role model and mentor to the lawyers who worked with him at the firm including his son Jim who joined him in 1970. He was proud of their relationship as colleagues and partners as well as father and son. As dedicated as he was to his work, his first priority was always his family. He was a devoted and dutiful son supporting his family from the time he graduated Evander Childs High School. His older brother, Arthur, whom he idolized died at only 16 and it was a loss Jimmy always mourned. Through one of his many friends he met the beacon of his life Irma Louise Spitzer of Montgomery, Alabama and in 1938 they married. Their romance was forever, a fairy tale of enduring love, mutual respect and total commitment. He was a loving and always proud father, demanding but fair; he became the mentor and best friend to his two sons, M. James of Manhattan and Thomas Neil of Portland Oregon who are forever grateful for the joy and guidance their Dad bestowed for all these years. No less was his love for his daughters-in-law (he regarded them as daughters) Sheri Lagin and Mardi Schnitzer Spitzer. He was smitten with, admired and adored his three granddaughters, Ashley Fagan, Jessica Spitzer and Jamie Spitzer and he was proud of all of their considerable accomplishments. He was generous to them in every way, providing advice when asked, an ear to listen when needed and emotional support and love always. He brought joy to and enriched their lives. He made them laugh, he told them stories of growing up in a different age and he encouraged them to pursue their dreams and to fulfill their goals and he assisted them in every way possible. His three granddaughters knew how special he was and how lucky they were. They spoke with him daily often expressing their love, asking for advice or just laughing, kidding and tormenting him. Most recently he became a great-grandfather of Cameron Fagan, Ashley's son and he was overwhelmed by re-experiencing the wonders of life. The joy he experienced immediately after Cameron's birth in holding and bathing Cameron was a cherished milestone in a life which spanned six generations and was lived to its fullest. Jimmy loved life and those he encountered along the way including not only his peers and contemporaries, but making friends with people of all ages and from all walks of life. He always had stories to tell and jokes to share, advice to give, and a willingness to listen. He was passionate about playing golf and was a member of the Quaker Ridge Golf Club in Scarsdale and the Longboat Key Club in Florida. His golfing buddies were his best friends. He was an avid reader of biographies and history, mainly American, always striving to improve his mind. He followed political events closely and was always ready for a spirited discussion. Most of all, his generosity, his joy of life, his humor, his laughter, his openness, his intellect, his respect for others, his belief in what each of us can accomplish attracted friends wherever he went. People wanted to be with him, to listen and to talk and he fully enjoyed the company of each of them and their times together. He was a remarkable man who embraced life with an unbounded optimism for what tomorrow will bring. In his multitude of roles, son, husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, counselor, advocate, friend, he will be missed and admired forever and forever. Services will be at 9:30am Wednesday, May 6 at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York, NY. 212-362-6600. Contributions in the memory of M. James Spitzer may be made to Fordham University School of Law, 140 West 62nd Street, New York, NY 10023."

Perhaps no photographer was more plagued by the dichotomy (if there in fact is one), than the late great, Richard Avedon, who pretty much disowned his fashion work in favor of his large format portraiture. The exhibition, ""Avedon Fashion 1944-2000,"" opening May 15 at the International Center of Photography, presents this disowned work as a seminal body of fashion photography. And none of it looks at all shabby. Co-curator Carol Squiers notes, ""Fashion photography we know nominally as a woman in a dress. It's a beauty picture with a commercial purpose to sell something. But with the best fashion photographers, it was not about promoting a particular dress. You have them doing extraordinary things."" (See the slide show below for proof.) According to Squiers, in Avedon's view, fashion and portraiture were one and the same. ""I can't speak for him,"" she says, ""but my interpretation of things is that he was attacked in the late 60s for being a fashion photographer and felt he had to be taken seriously. He was never about beautiful women anyway. He was always digging into a more complex mood."""

He was an expert in many areas and has been published widely in the fields of atomic and nuclear physics, oceanography, finance, free market economic theory, chaos theory, and, most notably, horse racing and the stock market. He and his wife Heather have travelled the world, from the North to the South Pole and all continents and countless countries in between. His steadfastness, gregarious sense of humor and generosity were just a few of his remarkable traits, and he was loved by all who knew him. His total and absolute devotion to Heather was remarkable and was admired by anyone who saw them together. Burt Fabricand is survived by his beloved wife Heather North Fabricand, children Nicole Person, Lorraine Fabricand, and stepchildren Robin James, Leslie North, Anthony North, Thaddeus North, and seven grandchildren.

2009-05-07T00:00:00Z,"The N.C.A.A. has talked about an increase in the academic progress of athletes in the high-profile sports of football, baseball and men's basketball, but when it released its academic reform data Wednesday, an old story line reappeared. Almost every college that received significant punishment for poor academic progress came from leagues outside the established powers. Nothing epitomized that better than the N.C.A.A.'s first postseason bans for poor grades, which were handed out to the Centenary men's basketball team and the Tennessee-Chattanooga football team. (The Jacksonville football team is appealing its ban.) Of the 85 teams punished in football and men's basketball, only 10 came from the six Bowl Championship Series conferences. ''It's an expensive ordeal,'' said Myles Brand, the N.C.A.A. president, referring to providing adequate academic support. ''Those schools who can't afford it are more likely to run into trouble.''

Abrams' reboot of the 43-year-old ""Star Trek"" franchise, and Hollywood is having trouble thinking about anything other than how well it will do in theaters this weekend. Paul Dergarabedian, of Hollywood.com Box Office, told Reuters he expected a massive opening of somewhere between $80-million and $100-million. That would be considerably more than the $65-$75 million that many other box office analysts were predicting. Box Office Guru, for instance, predicts $74 million, including Thursday night's ""preview"" screenings. EW's Hollywood Insider goes lower, guessing $65 million. Paramount, which is releasing the film, was trying to keep expectations low, saying some of its recent research pointed to an opening closer to $50 million. It's a particularly difficult opening to predict, analysts said, because no one really knows how many hard-core fans will accept this new, younger cast or whether younger audiences will want to engage with their parents' sci-fi franchise. But reviews have been almost uniformly ecstatic. Metacritic, which keeps track of such things, says 84 percent of reviews have been positive compared to only 43 percent positive reviews for last weekend's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" which went on to an $85 million opening."

The dozens of watercolors he did that summer were landscape-filled, with sloping pastures and wall-like mountains dwarfing human figures, idylls so perfect that they look unreal. The New York State Thruway buzzes through that landscape now. Most of the pastures are gone, but the mountains are still here: Schunnemunk, behind a series of ridges; Storm King, running high and long before dropping into the Hudson. And recently, some new additions, baby mountains, have appeared: seven undulating, grass-covered ranges of them."

Nearly all depict scenes of Jewish (and some gentile) life in between-the-wars Poland with a charming combination of poignancy and precision."

2009-05-08T00:00:00Z,"Ben Crane led a surprising first-round assault on par at the T.P.C. Sawgrass in the Players Championship on Thursday, taking advantage of benign conditions and a generous setup to shoot a seven-under-par 65 that was one stroke better than the threesome of John Mallinger, Richard S. Johnson and Alex Cejka, and two strokes clear of a group of nine tied at 67. The low scoring began early in the day on a course softened by rain from thunderstorms that swept through the area at about midnight. Making the most of the party atmosphere were some players who were not household names: Mallinger, 29, has not finished higher than third in two and a half seasons on the tour; Cejka, 38, of the Czech Republic, had two wins on the tour at tournaments that no longer exist, in 2003 and 2004; Johnson, 32, of Sweden, won last year in Milwaukee and has missed two cuts in three Players appearances."

It's an appealing combination: balletic enough to reassure, strange enough to let audiences feel they are venturing onto new terrain.

Is every great player on the stuff? My mom has always been a big part of how I evaluate what to do when faced with a choice. She taught me to look at the big picture. A lot of people have asked me whether I'm bitter about having played the game ''clean'' while competing for my job with some opponents and teammates who weren't. But my mom sat on my shoulder (even from 1,000 miles away), reminding me that those who made the other choice could pay a big price."

The original Mille Miglia was begun by the Brescia Automobile Club, partly as a response to the town's loss of the Italian Grand Prix, which in 1922 had been moved to a new circuit in Monza. The race was from Brescia, near Milan, to Rome and back, a distance of about 1,000 miles, as the event's name suggests. According to the race's Web site (1000miglia.eu) Italian automakers supported the event because it would help them reach potential buyers in more remote regions of the country."

2009-05-10T00:00:00Z,"PRYDE--Harry. Long time advocate for affordable housing, passed away March 30, 2009, following a three year illness. Born to Ruby and Aubrey Pryde, on a depression-era farm near Sunnyside, Washington, Harry planned a life trajectory that would take him from asparagus fields in the Yakima Valley, to Seattle, to Washington D.C., and to most of the world. After completing his degree in Economics and Business at Washington State University, he served two years as an officer in the U.S. Air Force, with an extended posting in (then French) Morocco. Following his military service he entered the University of Washington in what is now the Evans School of Public Affairs to earn a Master's degree in Public Administration. There he met his future wife, Ann Catoni, in an Administrative Law class. Before completing his studies, Harry held an internship as Assistant City Manager of Port Angeles. Following graduation, he worked at the University of Washington in the Association of Washington Cities and the Institute of Governmental Research, an experience that he often remarked he greatly valued. It was in these years that Harry confirmed his belief in the interplay of higher education and the formation of public policies on critical issues such as urban planning and housing. Harry entered the business world as a home builder, starting with a few houses in the Northgate area. In time he founded Pryde Corporation, a diversified company responsible for developing and building homes, apartment complexes, office buildings, convalescent centers and condominiums. He built one of the first condominium buildings in Seattle in 1970 on Capitol Hill overlooking Lake Union. Harry devoted many years to working on national and local housing issues. In 1983, he was elected president of the National Association of Home Builders the first builder from the northwest to be elected to this position. He had also been president of the Seattle and Washington State Master Builder's Association. He was inducted into the National Housing Hall of Fame, as well as the local and state Master Builder's Association Hall of Fame, and the University of Washington Construction Hall of Fame. He served on numerous civic, state, and national boards, including the Seattle Housing Authority, Washington State Affordable Housing Commission, Washington State Housing Finance Commission, and the Washington State Housing Task Force. He was a founder of Enterprise Bank in 1988, and on the Board of Directors of both the Seattle and Bellevue Chambers of Commerce. He was a Director of DASH (non-profit housing for low income families). He also was a Director of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle. In his private capacity and as a friend and advisor of public figures, Harry Pryde continued to emphasize the importance of affordable housing. His ongoing multiple interests in public policy and economics in housing were recognized when he received the 2006 Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Graduate School of Public Affairs at the University of Washington. He established a fellowship in 2002 to provide internships in Washington D.C., for graduate students in the Evans School of Public Affairs so students may gain insight into national and global policy. Having learned to play the violin as a boy, Harry remained devoted to musical and other cultural activities. He enjoyed attending concerts of the Seattle Symphony as well as lectures and seminars on public affairs. Harry and his wife Ann have been donors to many cultural, civic, and academic organizations. Harry had a fascination for the world at large. He was a prolific traveler with a global curiosity, seizing every opportunity to visit other nations. He sought to expand and encourage knowledge and understanding through the experience of travel, as when he led his family on a historical tour of Europe and the Aegean Sea in 1973. Other family activities included riding the rapids through the Grand Canyon, sailing the Gulf Islands and around Vancouver Island, and weekly skiing at Crystal Mountain. He enjoyed golf, his time boating and skiing with family and friends, and his many walks on the beach. He was a voracious reader, well-informed and forthright in his opinions. He remained active and engaged with the world throughout his life falling ill while skiing in Sun Valley. Harry Pryde valued principles of hard work, established in his early childhood on the family farm. He constantly sought to expand his and others' knowledge of the world. His family expresses great admiration and a deep appreciation for all he accomplished and for all he gave, his love and his caring. He is survived by Ann, his wife of 52 years, three children, six grandchildren; by his sister, sister-in-law and brother-in-law, several nieces and nephews and many devoted friends. A celebration of his life was held on Sunday, April 19 at 3pm at the Seattle Yacht Club."

''My son had volunteered for the Shanti Bhavan school in 2006, which teaches dalit children, or untouchables, in order to help them get out of poverty and become community leaders. He went back again last year, so I decided to go for a month and see it for myself and do some volunteer work. Each day, we started at 5 a.m. and went until at least 10 at night. I'd take the kids on nature walks, and then I taught classes -- chemistry, environmental sciences. The picture is from when I went to see the villages where some of the children come from. They live in fairly nice circumstances at school, but all of them come from very impoverished backgrounds, and it was helpful for me to be able to put everything in context. I really made a connection with the children and staff at the school. I feel like they're part of my family now. Besides being a chance to be with my son, it was, personally, a wonderful experience.'' As told to Austin Considine"

2009-05-10T00:00:00Z,"A FEW months ago the Criterion Collection offered as part of its no-frills Eclipse line a fascinating set of Roberto Rossellini's historical films, made for European television in the 1970s. The newest Eclipse release, a four-film set titled ''Alexander Korda's Private Lives,'' also consists of historical dramas, but of a much different sort. Where Rossellini tried to film the complex interplay of social, technological and economic forces surrounding figures like Cosimo de' Medici, René Descartes and Blaise Pascal, these four films produced by Korda in England between 1933 and 1936 offer something else: a subjective, frequently sardonic view of history, centered not on great, abstract forces but on immediate physical needs."

2009-05-11T00:00:00Z,"FINA--Charles, Executive Vice President of Michael C. Fina Co., died on May 9, 2009, after a long battle with acute myelogenous leukemia. Born in 1945, he was the younger son of Rose and Michael Fina, who founded the Michael C. Fina Co. in 1935. Charlie and his brother George were involved in the family business since they were young. Throughout his childhood and adulthood, Charlie helped grow a small store into a New York-based icon known worldwide for offering silver, jewelry, china and gifts for weddings and all occasions. Following the unexpected death of their father, Charlie and George took on the management of the business with their mother. Charlie was totally committed to his work, rising before 5am to be the first in the office each day. While working, Charlie attended Hofstra University earning a degree in business management. He had a deep and loving bond with his brother George. They helped each other in business and life and were the closest of friends. For the nearly 45 years they were in business together, they always shared an office with two desks facing each other. Charlie drove the creation of the Michael C. Fina Corporate Recognition division in the 1990s. Today, Michael C. Fina provides recognition gift programs for leading companies worldwide with sales offices throughout the United States, Europe and Canada. At the same time, the retail business, located on 5th Avenue, has continued its success. Charlie led a full life outside of work as well. The love of his life was his devoted wife, Jane, who spent every hour of his last years and days by his side. He also shared a close relationship with his three sons, all of whom help run the family business. His biggest passions were fishing and boating. A committed philanthropist, Charlie and his family were major supporters of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and Michael C. Fina is a National Supporting Sponsor. Charlie found his greatest happiness from his large but close-knit family. He is survived by his wife, Jane, sons Michael (and wife Danielle), Jeffrey (and wife Brooke), and Steven (and wife Elizabeth), grandchildren Samantha, Jason, George, Jack and Brandon, his beloved brother George (and wife Lynne), his niece Ashley and his nephews Bret and Cord and their families.

2009-05-11T00:00:00Z,"SMITH Alvin J. Died May 9 at the age of 85 after a brief illness and an eventful life. Raised in the Bronx, he joined the Army in 1943, and trained as a Japanese interpreter. The war ended before he got overseas, and he went into the family millinery business. When hats disappeared in the 1960s, he mastered an entirely new career, eventually establishing his own investment firm. He married Blanche Stern in 1947. They were the happiest of couples: for 62 years each was a source of strength and delight to the other. Next to his family, Alvin loved sports best, especially horse racing, and he could dash through challenging crossword puzzles in ink and in minutes. This witty, generous, sardonic and most sociable man is mourned by his many friends, by his wife, by his daughters Susan, Carol and Laura, by his sons-in-law Neil Meltzer, Richard Snow, and Richard Rosenberg, by his grandchildren Joshua, David, Emily (and her husband Evan), Michael, and Rebecca, as well as his friend of fifty years, Mattie Smith; his son, Richard, died in 1990. Services are at noon today at Schwartz Brothers Funeral Home, 11403 Queens Boulevard, Forest Hills, New York. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Richard Mark Smith Fund, North Shore-LIJ Foundation, 125 Community Drive, Great Neck, NY 11021."

The music, written and arranged by Mr. Argue, an intense young composer from Vancouver, British Columbia, felt crowded with ideas: about jazz orchestration, minimalist rhythmic devices, post-rock textural dynamics. ''Transit,'' which closed the set, paired a driving swing tempo with a dronelike harmonic underlay, creating a dual impression of progress and stasis. It was early in the life of the Secret Society, an 18-piece big band, but already there were the stirrings of an identity."

Dated July 13, 1530 and addressed to Pope Clement VII, the letter asks for the annulment of Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon and includes the seals of dozens of peers of England who concurred with the request. A facsimile of the document will go on sale next month for about $68,000 from Venice-based publisher Scrinium, which plans a limited run of 199 copies. A second, more damaged, copy of the document is in England’s National Archives in Kew. The facsimile and accompanying scholarly texts will allow for closer perusal of “the cause of Henry VIII,” Monsignor Sergio Pagano, the archive’s Prefect, told journalists on Tuesday. It will be officially presented in June, on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of Henry’s coronation, but the timing is a coincidence, Monsignor Pagano said. “We do not celebrate kings, only popes.”"

The producer Jeffrey Richards, in announcing the casting on Tuesday, maintained his weeks-long silence on the plot of the play (presumably a marketing strategy to heighten public curiosity); he also would not say anything about Mr. Spader’s role, though he did disclose there are other characters in the play. “Race” is scheduled to begin previews at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Nov. 17 and to open on Dec. 6."

Azis has been heavily involved with Euroroma, his country's socially liberal Roma's rights party, and was recently voted the 21st greatest Bulgarian of all time. (He is also known for simulating sex with men onstage.) Ustata supported 50 Cent on the Bulgarian leg of his tour back in 2006, and is responsible for the song ""Clothes are Just an Obstacle to Me.""Both Azis and Ustata perform Chalga, a form of Bulgarian folk-pop that combines Roma, Turk and Bulgarian folk strings and brass with electro beats and over-the-top lyrics. In their mind-blowing video, the slightly heavy Asiz imitates Bollywood stars while dressed as a bearded Eastern European gangster's moll; meanwhile, Ustata lounges in a limo and pets a cheetah, perhaps channeling both Biggie Smalls and Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's thuggish, 32-year-old president, who has a well documented penchant for tigers. Our Bulgarian is not quite what it used to be, so we're not really sure what the song is about, but one thing is certain: this duo is challenging not just musical conventions, but just about every traditional notion of masculinity."

It will be officially presented in June, on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of Henry’s coronation, but the timing is a coincidence, Monsignor Pagano said. “We do not celebrate kings, only popes.”."

2009-05-14T03:14:13Z,"It's hard to think of anyone that was better qualified to impart style advice to the un-rouged masses in the 1980s than Brenda Dickson, the daytime television actress who starred in ""The Young and the Restless"" and snapped up the 1988 Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Villainess in a Daytime Serial. (The honor had narrowly escaped her in 1986.) Nearly 10 minutes long, this video can be muddled in parts - especially when Dickson carries on about the importance of curling one's eyelashes to achieve ""a very professional look,"" and explains that she powders ""very, very good.""Having said that, there are several truly mesmerizing moments (""ostrich feathers, anyone?"") that would come in handy to the many designers who have recently revived the glitzy excesses of the Ivana era. While it's sadly undeniable that Dickson's dictums are not particularly well articulated - ""fashion is something that is acquired by looking at different fashions"" and ""style is as important in your life as your look"" come to mind - I'm willing to bet that the impromptu show she stages in her closet will make an impression. I, for one, will not easily forget that suede and leather can be very dressy, especially when accessorized with a fox draped over one shoulder. Well, hello!"

Last year at the annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine in Indianapolis, Justin Shroyer, a biomechanics doctoral student at Auburn University in Alabama, presented findings that show flip-flop sandals alter the way a person walks, changing the gait in ways that could lead to heel, sole and ankle problems. Athletes are particularly prone to all sorts of foot maladies that are a result of wearing restrictive shoes during high-impact activities. So manufacturers are hoping that a new trend -- call it the après-sport sandal -- will give athletes post-sport relief and address some of the shortcomings of the typical flip-flop.

What they knew and had read in their guide books was that not many people are in church on Sunday morning, especially compared to the florid religiosity of the United States. So their working assumption was that Americans take religion seriously and Europeans don’t. The new thought that amazed them was that the unchurched Europeans live in social democracies deeply saturated with historic Christian values, while the much-churched Americans celebrate a society characterized by a ruthless social Darwinism that the God of the Bible, Old and New Testament alike, denounces."

Bearn, M.D. Alick was an esteemed member of this community for nearly sixty years, first as a faculty member, then as a trustee. He found his way to Rockefeller in 1951 when his strong belief in investigative medicine led Dr. Henry Kunkel to offer him a laboratory appointment. Alick focused on rare metabolic disorders, eventually heading his own laboratory, the first at Rockefeller dedicated to human genetics. After joining the faculty of Cornell University Medical College in 1966, Alick continued his association with Rockefeller as a visiting professor and physician, and was invited to join the Board of Trustees in 1970. In 2002, he was awarded the David Rockefeller Award for Extraordinary Service to the University. Alick Bearn was a trusted friend and advisor to seven Rockefeller presidents. Through his trusteeship, his books and publications, his leadership of the Kunkel Society, and his membership on the Lewis Thomas Prize committee, to name just a few of his many endeavors, he continued to enhance the intellectual vitality of the University his entire life. He will be remembered for his wise counsel and his enormous personal integrity. Alick possessed a unique blend of warmth, wit, wisdom, and a profound sense of service to humankind. His charm and irrepressible ebullience made being in his company a true delight. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his beautiful wife and partner of 56 years, Margaret, who is in every way his equal in warmth, intellect, and zest for life. We also extend our sympathy to their wonderful family: their daughter, Helen, and her husband, Rockefeller University Council member Russell Pennoyer; their son, Gordon, and his wife, Ellen; and their grandchildren.

He was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Camp Seven and Sephardic Renaissance, both of which served underprivileged children. He was a Past Master Mason. He neither asked for nor sought recognition for his many acts of charity, benevolence and kindness. A self-made man with integrity, character, warmth and humor, he was rarely seen without his cigar. He was a shining example of the ""Greatest Generation"" and his passing marks an end of an era. He is survived by his loving and devoted wife Mona, and four children Barbara, Alan, Lori, and Mitchell, his 12 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild, two brothers and three sisters. Dad, you are our hero and role model. Your love, generosity, wisdom, humor and kindness will be greatly missed. You made the world a better place for all those who had the good fortune to know you. We promise that the glowing embers of your precious memory will forever burn in our hearts bringing with it the warmth and comfort of your everlasting love, broad smile and eternal blessings."

He was an internationally renowned expert in clinical hypertension and a scientific leader in the fields of hypertension and cardiovascular behavioral medicine. He coined the term ""white-coat hypertension"" to describe those whose blood pressure was elevated in the doctor's office, but normal in everyday life, and later published the first editorial describing ""masked hypertension"" (the opposite phenomenon). He was formerly President of the Society of Behavioral Medicine, the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research, and a leader in other national and international scientific organizations. He published over 500 articles. His core belief was that much of cardiovascular disease arises from psychosocial factors, and is hence potentially preventable or treatable by modifying these. Always a gentleman, he leaves a legacy of outstanding scholarship, collegiality, and many younger clinical investigators, who are now spread across the world. He was a wonderful mentor and friend and will be greatly missed by his colleagues and co-workers at Columbia University's Center for Behavioral and Cardiovascular Health and Division of General Medicine.

Susan had one brother, Fred Crobaugh, who preceded her in death. Her marriage to Kirk Willis ended in divorce. As an actress, she worked extensively on Broadway in roles ranging from the classical Medea to Miss Mazeppa (opposite Ethel Merman) in Gypsy. She appeared alongside Sir Alec Guinness in Dylan, assumed the role of Fraulein Schneider (from Lotte Lenya) in the original production of the Tony winning musical, Cabaret. Her other Broadway credits include her debut in Take Me Along, plus Stephen Sondheim's Follies and Oliver with Patti LuPone. Much of Ms. Willis's career was situated in the theatre, including the off-Broadway Mirror Repertory stagings of Children of the Sun and The Madwoman of Chaillot. Her National Touring Company roles included a 350-city stint, playing Golda in Fiddler on the Roof (playing opposite five Tevyes), as well as performances in Mame, Picnic, Blithe Spirit, Desk Set, Zorba, and The Merchant of Venice. She essayed 23 of Shakespeare's characters over the years, beginning with her portrayal of Portia in The Merchant of Venice at the Barter Theatre in Virginia. Her regional and summer stock credits included Stella in Light Up the Sky as well as productions with the Great Lakes Theatre Festival, the San Diego Shakespeare Festival, the Old Globe Theatre and the Cleveland Playhouse, where she won a fellowship and began her professional career after graduating from Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh. Her motion picture roles included Clint Eastwood's Mystic River opposite Sean Penn, The Majestic with Jim Carey, What About Bob with Bill Murray, She Devil with Meryl Streep, plus the head teacher in The Faculty. She also appeared in Paul Newman's The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon, Marigolds, Ropewalk, and Petty Crimes. For three years, on the television series, All My Children, she played Helga Voynitzeva (Demetri's maid, who was ultimately thrown off a parapet in Budapest by Erica Kane). She also made guest appearances on Law & Order, Third Watch, S.V.U., the Fox-TV series, Million Dollar Mysteries and HBO's Sex in the City where she played Cynthia Nixon's elderly neighbor. She crowned her lengthy career by creating a unique cabaret act with pianist Rod Derefinko, called My First 50 Years in the Theatre, in which she performed songs by Cole Porter, Kurt Weill and Noel Coward. For many years Willis served as a council member of The Episcopal Actors Guild. She was also very active with The Village Recycling Center since its inception, and with the Fire Island Pines Arts Council. She was in the process of doing developmental reading of two plays, Dusa Died in Pittsburgh and The Roadway to Heaven. A memorial service is planned for June.

2009-05-17T00:00:00Z,"As the petals of the dogwoods fall, saucy skirts are causing men to turn their heads. These are not the full skirts of the '50s; they are fitted over the hips and then let loose in a flurry of godets, flanges and pleats. A printed design achieved its bounce through the weight of a hem of pink satin-ribbon. Knitted versions swing thanks to sunburst stitchery, narrow to start and then released to form ruffles at the hem. This change of silhouette from pencil skirts was the idea last year of the Paris designer Azzedine Allaïa, who constructed an unusual tulip-petal godet to give the skirt of his coats a sassy swing, right. The Allaïa skirts are the work of a major couturier and nearly uncopyable."

He was 70 years old. Dan is a descendant of Joshua Jones, founder of Monticello, Kentucky and cousin to Harriet Vittum, the social activist and long time Head Resident of the Northwestern University Settlement House in Chicago's West Town neighborhood. Daniel was the only son of Kathryn J. Vittum and Daniel W. Vittum, Sr. He was born in Kentucky where he lived until his family moved first to Chicago and then Arlington Heights at the age of three. A 1957 graduate of Arlington High School, he was top student and all around athlete, lettering in football, basketball, and his best loved sport, baseball. Dan attended the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana where he continued to excel academically. He graduated with a Bachelors in Science degree in Chemistry with high distinction, Phi Beta Kappa, in 1961. He went on to graduate from the University of Michigan Law School, first in class, Order of the Coif, in 1964. Daniel joined Kirkland & Ellis in 1964, became a partner in 1970 and retired in 2000. During his life, Daniel continued the long family tradition of family service to children, families and communities in Chicago. Under Dan's leadership at the Northwestern University Settlement the Settlement Association doubled in physical size, budget and participation of children and families. The Vittum Theater was constructed and then became home to Adventure Stage Chicago which currently reaches out to 13,000 students and 100 public schools annually. From 1998 to the present, Dan led the Settlement's successful efforts to obtain a charter from the Chicago Public Schools to found Noble Street Charter School. Under Dan's leadership the school has gained national recognition and since 2005 has gone through an expansion which will result in a total of 11 campuses by 2011. Dr. Christine L. Jacobek said of her husband, Daniel, He was a unique man, brilliant intellectually and compassionate, gentle and unpretentious, personally. I think he experienced and related to the world using the intellect of his mind and the softness of his heart. His loving memory comforts his wife; his two sons Stephen Frederic and Daniel Weeks, III, MD; his daughter-in-law, Bernice Man, MD; and his joyous granddaughters, Mora Kai, Tali Elizabeth, and Neenah Kathryn. A Memorial Service and reception will be held on Saturday, May 30, 2009 at 11am at The Vittum Theater. The address is: 1012 North Noble, Chicago, IL. Donations in Daniel's memory would be gratefully received by The Noble Network of Charter Schools at: 1010 North Noble, Chicago, IL 60622 or the Northwestern University Settlement Association at: 1400 Augusta Blvd., Chicago, IL 60622.

2009-05-17T00:00:00Z,"As expected, the four sculptures by Chakaia Booker in the garden at the Katonah Museum of Art provide the most stimulating experience of outdoor art in Westchester right now. Not only does Ms. Booker, 56, possess a natural eye for expressive forms, but her materials -- cast-off rubber tires from cars, trucks and tractors -- are manipulated with such zeal as to suggest a vivid essay on how to make art from unorthodox materials. The variety of the pieces further testifies to her command of sculptural techniques, control of detail and versatility as an outdoor sculpture specialist. Many artists have produced excellent outdoor public sculptures, but I can think of only a few who have been as successful -- and over such a long period of time -- as Ms. Booker. Part of that success comes from the material she uses, which is ideally suited to art in an outdoor environment."

''I really never received this much feedback on my work before,'' said Mr. Krug, who has also directed music videos for Ladytron and Ratatat. He became interested in shooting Polaroid last year when it was announced that the instant film would be discontinued; and its eventual demise (it has been estimated that by September, the supply will be entirely depleted) adds a certain poignancy.

The Danish middle-aged enfant terrible, who has been shaking up both the festival and world cinema for more than a decade with films like “Breaking the Waves” and “Dogville,” is clearly intent on holding on to his provocateur status, even if it means alienating (dividing, baffling) his audience further.

In 2006, a United States district court in New York ruled that the son, Thomas Steinbeck, and the granddaughter, Blake Smyle, should be granted the rights to 10 Steinbeck novels, including “Of Mice and Men” and “Tortilla Flat.” They said they had filed a notice of termination that had ended a 1994 agreement between Penguin Books and Elaine Steinbeck, the author’s widow, who died in 2003.

A case in point is in Gabon, where a trove of nesting leatherback turtles has been revealed on a stretch of largely untrammeled beaches. Biologists from the Wildlife Conservation Society, working with Gabonese conservation groups, estimate that anywhere from 15,000 to 41,000 female leatherback turtles are nesting there, making the spot the world's largest known nesting ground for the giant and extremely endangered reptile. The estimates grew out of aerial surveys led by Matthew Witt of the University of Exeter in England and are described in a paper being published later this year in the journal Biological Conservation. Most of the nesting is taking place in areas that are already designated as parks or otherwise protected, the group says. As I wrote not long ago, there are growing threats to the turtles in parts of Gabon, even in places where beachfront development or poaching aren't an issue. Thousands of stray logs drifting down the Congo River from clearing operations are cluttering some nesting beaches, forming deadly blockades that trap leatherbacks. But over all it's clear that leatherbacks have a strong beachhead in this country, at least for now."
2009-05-18T13:59:54Z,"The Tamil Tiger rebels in Sri Lanka have been defeated militarily, but where does that leave the Tamil diaspora that has supported the struggle?"
2009-05-18T13:59:54Z,"Update | 6:36 a.m. | May 19 In a telephone interview with Britain's Channel 4 News on Sunday, a spokesman for Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger militants, Selvarasa Pathmanathan, said that while the defeated rebels were laying down their arms, they would ""not surrender."" What exactly this means for the rebel force, whose leader the Sri Lankan army claims to have killed, is not exactly clear, but it does seem to encapsulate the mood of many in the large, vocal Tamil diaspora who are simply not willing to accept that this military defeat means an end to their dream of an independent Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka."

The blog's name comes from a song by Billy Ed Wheeler, he explains. In a post last week, Mr. Ward noted that the Obama administration had approved 42 of 48 proposed mountaintop mining projects. This appears to reflect how the administration, the United States and many other countries remain stuck between a hard place (reliance on coal for cheap electricity) and a soft rock (bituminous coal). Reflecting that enduring reality, just last month the West Virginia Coal Association noted that Britnee Gibson, a senior at Gilbert High School, successfully led an effort to have the state legislature name coal the official state rock. (A hat tip to the daily news digest of the Society of Environmental Journalists for bringing Coal Tattoo to my attention.)"

He loves to stage art shows (by people like Ruben Toledo, Christopher Makos, or James Brown) alongside those of design or fashion. In 1985, one of Pucci's earliest cross-disciplinary efforts had Putman designing a mannequin, a young Isabel Toledo dressing it, and Andy Warhol and Keith Haring autographing everything in sight at the party Pucci gave to show it off.

Last week the Nobel Prize-winning poet Derek Walcottwithdrew from the running because news surfaced about sexual harassment claims made against him by a Harvard student in 1982. A dossier containing the details had been sent anonymously to 200 Oxford academics. Mr. Walcott's withdrawal left Ms. Padel and the Indian poet and critic Arvind Mehrotra in consideration. ''I should like to thank the university and the people who voted for me,'' Ms. Padel said. ''I feel honored and humbled to be given this responsibility and shall try to carry it out as well as I can. My backers based their support for me on what they felt I could offer poetry and students. Now I shall do my best to fulfill their trust.'' Ms. Padel's selection follows close on the heels of Carol Ann Duffy's appointment as Britain's poet laureate; that post had been held by male writers for 341 years."
2009-05-18T00:00:00Z,"BEARN--Alexander G.,M.D. The trustees, faculty, and staff of The Rockefeller University deeply mourn the loss of our beloved friend, Alexander G. Bearn, M.D. Alick was an esteemed member of this community for nearly sixty years, first as a faculty member, then as a trustee. He found his way to Rockefeller in 1951 when his strong belief in investigative medicine led Dr. Henry Kunkel to offer him a laboratory appointment. Alick focused on rare metabolic disorders, eventually heading his own laboratory, the first at Rockefeller dedicated to human genetics. After joining the faculty of Cornell University Medical College in 1966, Alick continued his association with Rockefeller as a visiting professor and physician, and was invited to join the Board of Trustees in 1970. In 2002, he was awarded the David Rockefeller Award for Extraordinary Service to the University. Alick Bearn was a trusted friend and advisor to seven Rockefeller presidents. Through his trusteeship, his books and publications, his leadership of the Kunkel Society, and his membership on the Lewis Thomas Prize committee, to name just a few of his many endeavors, he continued to enhance the intellectual vitality of the University his entire life. He will be remembered for his wise counsel and his enormous personal integrity. Alick possessed a unique blend of warmth, wit, wisdom, and a profound sense of service to humankind. His charm and irrepressible ebullience made being in his company a true delight. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his beautiful wife and partner of 56 years, Margaret, who is in every way his equal in warmth, intellect, and zest for life. We also extend our sympathy to their wonderful family: their daughter, Helen, and her husband, Rockefeller University Council member Russell Pennoyer; their son, Gordon, and his wife, Ellen; and their grandchildren.

Thomas, Kentucky on August 4, 1914, he graduated from Highlands High School and attended The University of Cincinnati before joining Billboard Magazine in 1934 as a ""printer's devil.""

Bill, who spent his entire publishing career at BPI, became general manager in 1946. He was elected as President in 1958, chairman 1976, and become chairman emeritus in 1985. Under his leadership, Billboard grew from a single publication with a small printing plant in Cincinnati, Ohio to a diversified communication organization headquartered in New York City. Bill served as chairman of American Business Media from 1960-1961 and in 1997 established the William D. Littleford Awards for Corporate Community Service that recognizes companies, organizations, and individuals who are actively involved in community service programs designed to alleviate social problems. Similarly, his work with the Advertising Counsel where he remained as an Honorary Director, was widely recognized. Along the way, he completed the Executive Education Program at Harvard Business School. After the death of his first wife (Mariana Weber) in 1957, Bill married Marian Hastings Towne. Together they were instrumental in the founding of the Vieques Conservation and Historical Trust on Vieques Island, Puerto Rico.

2009-05-20T16:10:42Z,"CANNES - Sleeping can be an issue when you're in a place that never sleeps. At Cannes you can easily slip from some fashion designer's disco after party right into an 8:30 a.m. press screening at one of the many small theaters along the Rue D'Antibes. This after having spent the previous 24 hours drifting in and out of various movies and parties, going from the bright sunlight of the street to the darkness of the theater and back again, mixing one fantasy world with another. You do not even need a change of clothes, as a good tuxedo -- a sort of James Bond uniform, with or without the ""de rigueur papillon noir,"" required if you want to get into the Palais du Cinema -- always looks right in Cannes, no matter the time of day. Of course, if you want to try that lifestyle, you will need more than one tuxedo.But if your lifestyle, like mine, factors in a couple of hours of sleep, starting and ending your day at the Martinez Hotel is the way to go. The hotel is celebrating its 80th anniversary on la Croisette, but like those Frenchwomen who make good use of plastic surgery and never give up smoking, the white stucco facade, the circular driveway perpetually choked with tourists armed with cameras, the pool bar and restaurants crammed with journalists asking questions to silent starlets, the beach club with its long dock and tanned bodies, do not show their age. The hallway, downstairs by the bar, is always good for an encounter with, say, Pedro Almodóvar on his way out to another morning press conference or on his way in after another movie party the night before. And with fashion showrooms set up on every floor and Chopard occupying the 10,000-square-foot penthouse suite, there is a constant flow of garment bags and bodyguards and jewelry up and down the stairs while publicists for actors and publicists for fashion houses and publicists for diamond and watch companies talk nonstop on their cellphones, probably to one another."

Though it is made from soy milk in roughly the same way cheese is made from mammal milk (a curdling agent is added, and it's drained of excess water), tofu doesn't take nearly as many forms as cheese. But neither is it solely the stuff of stir-fries. For example, I can almost guarantee you will be impressed by this dessert, a pudding that takes about as much time to make as hot chocolate. But there are a few qualifiers. Without chocolate, the flavor is unimpressive; it tastes like sweetened tofu. Add chocolate and a few Mexican spices, however, and you have a real winner.

Cynthia leaves many loving friends and family members, including two nieces and two nephews: Susan Lefferts of Salem, OR; Sarah Lefferts of Portland, ME; Thomas Lefferts of South China, ME; and Nicholas Lefferts of Denver, CO. Independent in mind and spirit, Cynthia had a keen interest in politics and in the life of the nation. Her working life was marked by high ideals. She began her career in 1951 as an administrative assistant at the Ford Foundation; she went on to serve as executive secretary of the New York State Commission on Government Operations of the City of New York and later of the New York State Moreland Commission on Welfare. She was a special assistant to Governor Nelson Rockefeller from 1963 to 1966, and then worked devotedly for Common Cause, serving in the 1970's as executive director of the organization's New York office. Cynthia was born in Santa Barbara, CA, in 1928, while her parents, Halleck Lefferts and Sarah Barney Lefferts, were on the faculty of the Thacher School in nearby Ojai. Her brothers Barney and Charlie died before her, in 1976 and 1996. Cynthia was educated at Concord Academy and the Winsor School, and graduated from Vassar College in 1951. From an early age, Cynthia loved the mountains, lakes, and streams of the Adirondacks, where she had a second home. When the effects of polio kept her off the highest peaks, she continued to walk, hike, and swim with vigor, and she took up tennis with a gracious tenacity. She was a longtime member of the Ausable Club in St. Huberts and a trustee of the related Adirondack Mountain Reserve. In 2007 Cynthia was given the Harold Weston Award for ""personal dedication to the unique spirit and qualities"" of the AMR. She also served on the board of managers of the Havens Relief Fund Society in New York. She was especially proud to be a trustee of the Pomfret School in Pomfret, CT, where her father had been headmaster. Cynthia's grace and courage were inspiration and example to her friends and family. She had steel in her sinews, but she was never hard. She was kind and fair-minded, and naturally elegant.

2009-05-20T00:00:00Z,"LITTLEFORD--William D. (known to his family and friends as Bill), former Chairman of Billboard Publications, Inc. (now part of Nielsen Business Media), died peacefully at his home in Princeton, NJ on Thursday, May 14th. He was 94 years old. Born in Ft. Thomas, Kentucky on August 4, 1914, he graduated from Highlands High School and attended The University of Cincinnati before joining Billboard Magazine in 1934 as a ""printer's devil."" Billboard, an entertainment publication founded by his grandfather William H. Donaldson in 1894, remained a family concern for over 90 years. Bill, who spent his entire publishing career at BPI, became general manager in 1946. He was elected as President in 1958, chairman 1976, and become chairman emeritus in 1985. Under his leadership, Billboard grew from a single publication with a small printing plant in Cincinnati, Ohio to a diversified communication organization headquartered in New York City. Bill served as chairman of American Business Media from 1960-1961 and in 1997 established the William D. Littleford Awards for Corporate Community Service that recognizes companies, organizations, and individuals who are actively involved in community service programs designed to alleviate social problems. Similarly, his work with the Advertising Counsel where he remained as an Honorary Director, was widely recognized. Along the way, he completed the Executive Education Program at Harvard Business School. After the death of his first wife (Mariana Weber) in 1957, Bill married Marian Hastings Towne. Together they were instrumental in the founding of the Vieques Conservation and Historical Trust on Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. They also founded the William & Marian Littleford Foundation which provides charitable support to deserving causes and the Marian & William Littleford Fund which supports college scholarships for students at Roslyn High School on Long Island. Marian preceded Bill in death in March of 2008. He is survived by his sister; Marjorie Littleford Ross, his children; Anne, Joseph, Michael, and Terry and three grandchildren, Ryan, Ariel, and William. A memorial service will be held on Thursday, May 28th at Calvary Church (277 Park Avenue South at 21st Street) at 10:30am. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Bill's memory to the Vieques Conservation & Historical Trust, Calle Flamboyan 138, Vieques, PR 00765."

(You won’t find it, for example, on the film adaptations of his comics “Watchmen” or “V for Vendetta.”) But one unexpected place that Mr. Moore’s name will soon turn up is alongside the rock musicians Andrew Broder (of the band Fog), Mike Patton (of Faith No More) and Justin Broadrick (of Godflesh) on an audiobook and soundtrack, Billboard reported. The performers are providing soundtrack elements for a recording of a semi-autobiographical multimedia work by Mr. Moore, to be published in 2010 and tentatively titled “Unearthing.” The British independent label Lex Records said that it would be releasing the deluxe version of “Unearthing,” which will include a photographic novel, art prints, a two-hour audiobook and a musical soundtrack on vinyl."

The Star-Ledger of Newark, in an analysis of documents provided by Ticketmaster to the New Jersey attorney general’s office found that of the 38,778 seats made available for two shows, on Thursday and Saturday, only 6,000 individuals were able to buy tickets for one or more of these seats. The Star-Ledger said that 10,494 tickets had been set aside for the performers, their record label and booking agent, the show’s sponsors and others. Internet customers had an advantage as 75 percent of the tickets were sold online, but the traffic to Ticketmaster.com overwhelmed the Web site. The action by the attorney general was initiated when more than 2,000 fans complained that when they tried to buy tickets online, they were instead directed to TicketsNow.Com, a resale site owned by Ticketmaster, where the prices were higher."

2009-05-21T00:00:00Z,"LEFFERTS--Cynthia, of New York and St. Huberts, NY, died peacefully in her Manhattan home on May 8. She was 80. Cynthia had been ill for some years with primary progressive aphasia. She was valiant at every turn. Cynthia leaves many loving friends and family members, including two nieces and two nephews: Susan Lefferts of Salem, OR; Sarah Lefferts of Portland, ME; Thomas Lefferts of South China, ME; and Nicholas Lefferts of Denver, CO. Independent in mind and spirit, Cynthia had a keen interest in politics and in the life of the nation. Her working life was marked by high ideals. She began her career in 1951 as an administrative assistant at the Ford Foundation; she went on to serve as executive secretary of the New York State Commission on Government Operations of the City of New York and later of the New York State Moreland Commission on Welfare. She was a special assistant to Governor Nelson Rockefeller from 1963 to 1966, and then worked devotedly for Common Cause, serving in the 1970s as executive director of its New York office. Cynthia was born in Santa Barbara, CA, in 1928, while her parents, Halleck Lefferts and Sarah Barney Lefferts, were on the faculty of the Thacher School in nearby Ojai. Her brothers Barney and Charlie died before her, in 1976 and 1995. Cynthia was educated at Concord Academy and the Winsor School, and graduated from Vassar College in 1951. From an early age, Cynthia loved the mountains, lakes, and streams of the Adirondacks, where she had a second home. When the effects of polio kept her off the highest peaks, she continued to walk, hike, and swim with vigor, and she took up tennis with a gracious tenacity. She was a longtime member of the Ausable Club in St. Huberts and a trustee of the related Adirondack Mountain Reserve. In 2007 Cynthia was given the Harold Weston Award for ""personal dedication to the unique spirit and qualities"" of the AMR. She also served on the board of managers of the Havens Relief Fund Society in New York. She was especially proud to be a trustee of the Pomfret School in Pomfret, CT, where her father had been headmaster. Cynthia's grace and courage were inspiration and example to her friends and family. She had steel in her sinews, but she was never hard. She was kind and fair-minded, and naturally elegant. A memorial service will be held this summer in Keene Valley, NY, in the Adirondacks."

Donors who send $5 or more will be ''automatically entered into a contest to win a trip to Washington, D.C., to attend our special dinner,'' the e-mail message declares.

2009-05-22T12:21:02Z,"In what we assume is the first cinematic competition in which a graphic and divisive movie by Lars von Trier has faced off against a family-oriented Disney-Pixar film, the animated feature has prevailed. The movie “Up,” a 3D cartoon, has won the Palm Dog prize, an award given annually during the Cannes Film Festival for best canine performance, BBC News reported. The prize, a satirical alternative to the Palme d’Or and voted by British film critics, was given this year to the animated character Dug, a dog who is able to talk by means of a high-tech collar. The critics made an exception this year by considering a talking fox from Mr. von Trier’s violent horror film “Antichrist” for the award; a black poodle from the Quentin Tarantino action movie “Inglourious Basterds” was also in the running. In Mr. von Trier’s defense, his 2003 film “Dogville” won the Palm Dog in 2003."

As it happens, though the buildup is interminable, the assault is briefer. I know because when I saw the film again for review, I timed it because I wanted something to think about besides the sights and sounds of a woman being brutalized: it was my way of resisting Mr. Noé’s obvious interest in assaulting his audience."

2009-05-22T10:00:35Z,"One of the ongoing dilemmas of being a comic book fan is deciding which format to buy. Do you support the series by buying the monthly comic book? Do you wait for the collected edition (which, if the monthly series has poor sales, may not occur)? If so, which collection to get? Some series receive the hardcover treatment first, followed by a softcover months later. A handful of popular or critically acclaimed series get deluxe treatments like Marvel’s Masterworks or DC’s Absolute collections. “Y: The Last Man” is the latest comic series to pose the existential question: opt for the 10-volume softcover set (the first volume of which is No. 10 on the paperback list) or wait for new deluxe editions? Enough readers chose the second deluxe volume to put it on the top of our hardcover list. A too-short preview of the first issue of “Y: The Last Man” is available here."

Furchgott, Ph.D., Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Physiology and Pharmacology and former Chair of Pharmacology, and a 1998 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Dr. Furchgott was an extraordinary scientist who made major contributions to our understanding of cardiovascular physiology and pharmacology. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for identifying the fundamental role that nitric oxide (NO) plays in the regulation of cardiovascular function. Dr. Furchgott discovered that the cells lining blood vessels produce a substance he called endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), which induces vascular relaxation. He subsequently proposed that EDRF is nitric oxide. Dr. Furchgott's discoveries, conducted in his laboratory at SUNY Downstate, have helped scientists understand and find new treatments for cardiovascular diseases and other conditions ranging from immune disorders to memory loss, pulmonary disease, and erectile dysfunction. Dr. Furchgott also received a Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1991 and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1996. Dr. Furchgott's brilliant career spanned several decades at SUNY Downstate. Throughout his tenure he was an inspiration to SUNY Downstate's students, faculty, administration, and staff. In Dr. Furchgott's honor, the Robert F. Furchgott Society was established at Downstate to support students and fellows conducting basic science studies in a broad array of subjects. Each year, the Society gives the Robert F. Furchgott Award for Excellence in Research to four individuals, including fellows and graduating students. We extend our deepest sympathies to Dr. Furchgott's children, Janie, Susie, and Terry Furchgott. A memorial service is planned to take place in Seattle on Saturday. The family suggests that, in lieu of flowers, donations in Dr. Furchgott's memory may be sent to the Furchgott Life Enrichment Fund, c/o Ida Culver House, 2315 Northeast 65th Street, Seattle, Washington 98115, which is also the site of the service, at 2:30pm.
