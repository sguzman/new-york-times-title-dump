2012-01-20T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (13) ANNA BOLENA Anna Netrebko opened the Metropolitan Opera season with this portrayal of the final days of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII, in this opera by Donizetti. Ekaterina Gubanova performs the role of Anna's romantic rival, Giovanna (Jane Seymour); Ildar Abdrazakov is the cruel Enrico (Henry VIII); Stephen Costello (above with Ms. Netrebko) is Anna's first love, Lord Percy; and Tamara Mumford is the queen's devoted page Smeton. Since taking over as general manager of the Met in 2006, Peter Gelb has been angling to make Ms. Netrebko ''a house prima donna in the old-world sense: a first among equals,'' and he ''must have felt that his plan was working,'' Anthony Tommasini wrote about the September premiere of this production by David McVicar, conducted by Marco Armiliato and presented here by ''Great Performances at the Met.'' ''Ms. Netrebko sang an elegantly sad aria with lustrous warmth, aching vulnerability and floating high notes,'' Mr. Tommasini said, and she ''dispatched Donizetti's cabaletta, all fiery coloratura runs and vehement phrases, with a defiance that brought down the house.'' Yet ''Ms. Netrebko's Anna and the overall performance of the opera were not what they could have been,'' he added, calling her singing cautious, Mr. McVicar's sets uninventive and safe, and Mr. Armiliato's conducting routine. 3:30 P.M. (IFC) PAN'S LABYRINTH (2006) The Mexican-born Guillermo del Toro directed this political fable cum fairy tale, set in a dark forest in 1944 Spain, about a young girl whose fantasies are trampled by her stepfather's fascist politics. The film, in Spanish with English subtitles, received Academy Awards for cinematography, art direction and makeup, but it lost the Oscar for best foreign language film to ''The Lives of Others,'' from Germany. Ivana Baquero, right, plays the film's heroine, Ofelia, who longs to believe in fairies, princesses and magic lands; Doug Jones plays the woodland creature (a couple of them, actually) who charges her with three tasks. ''Fairy tales (and scary movies) are designed to console as well as terrify,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''What distinguishes 'Pan's Labyrinth,' what makes it art, is that it balances its own magical thinking with the knowledge that not everyone lives happily ever after.''"

A decade into the war in Afghanistan, the report makes clear that these killings have become the most visible symptom of a far deeper ailment plaguing the war effort: the contempt each side holds for the other, never mind the Taliban. The ill will and mistrust run deep among civilians and militaries on both sides, raising questions about what future role the United States and its allies can expect to play in Afghanistan."

The ruling draws the final curtain on a closely watched six-year-long legal drama that helped to alter collecting practices at American museums after Italian prosecutors charged Marion True, the former curator of antiquities at the J.

2012-01-20T00:00:00Z,"When you think about it, the phrase ''action movie'' is a bit redundant. Really, what else are motion pictures for? In the earliest days of cinema our ancestors were thrilled to behold images of galloping horses, hurtling trains and capering dancers. Though our entertainments are now more elaborate, our appetites are not so different. A large part of what we crave is action: running, jumping, fighting, driving, flying. Sometimes everything else -- plot, character, emotion -- can seem superfluous. This appears to be the working hypothesis behind ''Haywire,'' a cold and kinetic experiment in high-impact, low-concept genre filmmaking directed by Steven Soderbergh. Starting with a brawl in a rural roadside diner, the film, written by Lem Dobbs, proceeds through a series of expertly choreographed, meticulously edited scuffles and chases, set pieces threaded around a plot that seems almost defiantly preposterous and uninteresting."

2012-01-20T00:00:00Z,"STRAND--Fleur L. New York University physiologist Fleur L. Strand, whose research showed the impact of stress-evoked hormones on the peripheral nervous system, died of adenocarcinoma on December 23, 2011 in her home in Snowmass Village, Colorado. She was 83. Strand, who attended NYU as an undergraduate and graduate student, and served on the faculty until her retirement in 1997, was the first to show that stress-evoked hormones, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), could have a direct effect on the peripheral nervous system, independent of the classical role on the adrenal gland. Her novel findings were controversial, and it took a number of years for the scientific community to accept the concept of ""neuropeptides""--classical endocrine peptide hormones that also act as important neuromodulators. Strand's seminal paper, ""A possible direct action of ACTH on nerve and muscle,"" was published in the journal Neuroendocrinology in 1974. Additional work from Strand's research in lab rats indicated that offspring of women who smoke or are exposed to high levels of stress during pregnancy could have sexual problems later in life, such as reduced libido. Strand received her academic degrees from NYU, where she obtained a B.A. (1948) and M.S. (1950) in biology, and a Ph.D. in physiology (1952). She also attended the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1944. Strand received a National Institutes of Health fellowship to study at the Physiological Institute of the Free University in Berlin, where she first conducted her ground-breaking work on ACTH. Strand began teaching in NYU's Department of Biology in 1961. In 1980, she became the department's first female chair. She was the Carroll and Milton Petrie Professor of Biology at NYU from 1991 to 1997, and also a professor of neural science. Strand became a Fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1976 and was elected Chair of the Board of Governors at the NYAS in 1987. She served as president of the board of trustees of the American Institute of Science and Technology and received numerous honors and awards throughout her career, including the American Medical Writers Award (1984) and Outstanding Woman Scientist of the Year from the New York Chapter of the Association for Women in Science (1987). The Fleur L. Strand Award, given by the American Physiological Society (APS), was established by her former graduate students in 2011 to recognize the achievements of a young physiologist, enabling the recipient to attend APS's annual Experimental Biology conference. Fleur Lillian Emanuel was born on February 24, 1928, in Bloemfontein, South Africa. She married Curt Strand, former chairman and CEO of Hilton International, in 1946. They had one daughter, Karen, who died in 2006. Fleur is survived by her husband Curt, and her brother Frank Emanuel of Cresskill, New Jersey. Donations may be made to the Fleur L.

2012-01-21T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (Lifetime) DREW PETERSON: UNTOUCHABLE (2012) In this drama adapted from real events, Rob Lowe portrays Drew Peterson, a former Illinois police officer accused of killing two of his wives. Cara Buono plays his third wife, who was found dead in an empty bathtub during their bitter divorce. Kaley Cuoco, above with Mr. Lowe, plays the 17-year-old he has been sleeping with, soon to be his fourth wife, who also disappears. Mr. Peterson insists that she left him for another man and unwittingly draws the attention of the news media to his past and present, professing his innocence while announcing his engagement to a 23-year-old woman. He is currently in a detention center in Joliet, Ill., awaiting trial. 8 A.M. (IFC) VOLVER (2006) Three generations of Spanish women (led by Penélope Cruz, below, in an Oscar-nominated role, as Raimunda, a hardworking mother pulled in all directions by terrible events) cope with life's joys and travails in this movie from Pedro Almodóvar, influenced by telenovelas and Hollywood weepies. Among those Raimunda spends her time consoling are her teenage daughter (Yohana Cobo); her sister Sole (Lola Dueñas), who tries to mask her loneliness behind good cheer; her elderly aunt (Chus Lampreave); and her sorrow-filled neighbor (Blanca Portillo). Carmen Maura is her mother, who seems to have returned from the dead. ''To relate the details of the narrative -- death, cancer, betrayal, parental abandonment, more death -- would create an impression of dreariness and woe,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''But nothing could be further from the spirit of 'Volver,' which is buoyant without being flip, and consoling without ever becoming maudlin. Mr. Almodóvar acknowledges misfortune -- and takes it seriously -- from a perspective that is essentially comic. Very few filmmakers have managed to smile so convincingly in the face of misery and fatality.''"

2012-01-21T00:00:00Z,"A prominent art collector has sued the dealer Larry Gagosian, claiming that he sold a 1964 Roy Lichtenstein painting from her collection without her consent. The suit, filed Wednesday in state court in Manhattan, is part of a tangle of art deals that led to two earlier lawsuits against the dealer in federal court, one of which Mr. Gagosian settled for $4.4 million last year, according to court papers. In the new suit, the collector Jan Cowles, 93, claims that in 2008, her son, Charles Cowles, a New York art dealer who was in desperate financial straits, transferred a Lichtenstein painting, ''Girl in Mirror,'' to Mr. Gagosian to sell, even though Mr. Cowles did not own the painting and had no permission from his mother to sell it. The suit contends that Mr. Gagosian later fraudulently claimed that the painting was damaged and sold it to an unnamed collector for $2 million, less than its market value, taking a $1 million commission on the sale. The suit, which asks for punitive damages of $10 million, accuses Mr. Gagosian of ''such wanton dishonesty as to imply criminal indifference to civil obligations, with reckless disregard of Mrs. Cowles's rights.''"

2012-01-21T00:00:00Z,"1/20/12 | Updated with elaboration on loan terms and comment from Republic Bank and Jackson Hewitt. This is the last tax season that any banks will be offering ''refund anticipation loans,'' according to the National Consumer Law Center. The loans, called R.A.L.'s in the industry, are short term, repaid with a borrower's income tax refund. Typically, the loans carried fat fees and were marketed through tax-preparation outlets to lower-income borrowers who wanted fast cash. Recent action by federal regulators means that just one bank, the Republic Bank & Trust Company of Louisville, Ky., is offering the loans this tax season. But it won't be doing so next year, under a settlement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. (It's possible that some smaller payday lenders, which until recently haven't had much federal oversight, may still offer some version of the loans.) This year, according to the consumer law center, filers who get a $1,500 refund anticipation loan from Republic through the Jackson Hewitt tax preparation chain will pay $61.22, which translates into an annual percentage rate of 149 percent for a 10-day term."

2012-01-21T00:00:00Z,Wall Street stocks and profits took a beating in 2011. But there is one corner of the Street that took a lighter hit: the compensation paid to chief executives.

Such stock is expected to make up most of their bonus as banks are increasingly paying employees more in deferred stock. Those awards to top bank executives are coming as lower-level employees are finding out that their own bonuses will be much smaller than a year ago.

2012-01-22T00:00:00Z,"DANIEL ARSHAM is two parts artist, one part architect. As a founder, with Alex Mustonen, of the design firm Snarkitecture, he has made his mark in the public realm with projects like ''Goal Posts,'' which commemorates the former Miami Orange Bowl, and ''Dig,'' an exhibition and performance at the Storefront for Art and Architecture in New York. Meanwhile, his art practice is thriving with collaborations with Merce Cunningham, Hedi Slimane and Jonah Bokaer. And his first solo show at the Ohwow gallery in Los Angeles -- ''the fall, the ball, and the wall'' -- opened on Friday. The ''ball'' in the title refers to his recent and final collaboration with the Merce Cunningham group and includes one of Mr. Arsham's huge hanging Pixel Clouds. The ''wall'' alludes to Mr. Arsham's befuddling sculptures, which appear to ooze from the surface of the wall. And the ''fall'' relates to structures that seemingly defy the laws of nature. ''I'm trying to create a space where the architecture appears to be in movement,'' he explained, ''as if it is in the process of forming or deforming itself.'' JOHNNY MISHEFF"

2012-01-22T00:00:00Z,"KHATAMI--Sayyid A.,Died peacefully at home in New York City on Friday, January 13, 2012 after a brief illness. Abul Khatami was born just outside Isfahan, Iran. The estimated date is 1918 due to the lack of birth records. His first memory there was surviving a cholera epidemic from which his mother died. He moved to Isfahan with his father, a religious leader, and they shared a home with a large extended family. His open-minded father had him educated at an English school, Stuart Memorial College. He excelled at math, and graduated early in order to teach there. He subsequently graduated from the University of Tehran. Later, Abul was drafted into the Iranian army, and in the chaos that followed the British sponsored coup against the pro German Shah of Iran (Reza Shah Pahlevi) in 1941; he briefly became acting police chief of Tehran. These circumstances ultimately led to his emigration to the United States. Just after WWII Abul embarked on a journey around the world by sea, finally arriving in San Francisco in 1947, and continuing on to New York, where continued his studies in English and Asian cultures at Columbia University. He completed his Masters degree at the Asia Institute, where he met another student, Marie Hoguet. They were married in 1951 and moved to Chicago where Abul pursued doctoral studies at the University of Chicago. After his return to New York, he became a U.S. citizen, and an anthropology teacher at the American Museum of Natural History, working with Margaret Mead. Abul and Marie raised their four children in Manhattan. Abul is survived by Marie Norton of Manhattan, Jim Khatami of San Francisco, Renee Khatami of Manhattan, Jessie K. Wallen of Del Mar, California, and grandchildren Christopher Khatami, Patrick Norton, Sophie and Emme MacArthur, and John and Jim Wallen. He was buried in Easthampton, New York with his late wife. Contributions may be made in his memory to The Explorers Club, where a memorial will be held at a later date. East or West, it doesn't matter now because you are in paradise.

His roar was mighty, his defensive cohorts terrifying, his quarterback comic relief. Lo, did Lewis slay mighty Giants, or at least the Jim Fassel Giants, and hoist the One True Trophy. Alas the era of defensive warriors passed, and the gilded age of flashy quarterbacks did plague the land with 5,000-yard passing seasons.

Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Estella attended the Holland Hall School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and graduated from Oberlin College, where she met the love of her life, Steve Salett. Before Estella and Steve were married in 2001, Estella received her law degree from the University of Minnesota, (Magna Cum Laude). Estella and Steve moved to New York and she began her legal career. After a clerkship for the Honorable Harold Baer, Jr. of the Southern District of New York, Estella became an Associate with Patterson, Belknap, Webb, and Tyler. A talented litigator, Estella helped lead a successful class action suit onbehalf of mentally disabled New Yorkers to help them to fully utilize the subway system. Throughout her life Estella was active in protecting the welfare and rights of women, children, and the disadvantaged, which included working in child welfare before law school and as an appellate lawyer for Children's Law Center in Brooklyn. For the last three years, Estella has been a Professor of Legal Writing at Brooklyn Law School and most recently successfully launched her own firm advising entrepreneurs. Skilled and authoritative in her legal judgments, Estella was an outstanding attorney, but the role she most valued was that of a loving wife and mother of two daughters, Amelia born in 2005, and Jessie in 2007. She is survived by parents Patricia Weymouth Schoen, John Garic (""Chick"") Schoen, Jr.; brother Garic Jesse Schoen; grandparents, J. Garic Schoen and Susan D.

A memorial service and celebration of Estella's life will be held on January 29th at 3:30pm at Old First Reformed Church, 729 Carroll St Brooklyn, Brooklyn."

2012-01-22T00:00:00Z,"WHEN it comes to health care, most liberals are committed above all to ensuring that every American has insurance. In their view, the greatest achievement of the health care reform act passed under President Obama is to finally erase the moral stain of the United States' being the only major developed country without universal coverage. But we also hold the questionable distinction of having the world's most expensive health care system -- what about cost control? For many liberals, that just sounds like a cover for heartless conservatives who care only about cutting benefits and not about helping people in need. But liberals are wrong to ignore costs. The more we spend on health care, the less we can spend on other things we value. If liberals care about middle-class salaries, public education and other state-funded services, then they need to care about controlling health care costs every bit as much as conservatives do."

The test environment, Times Square, was less than ideal, but I spent enough time in the Karma's cockpit to note what the car didn't do: rattle, shake or, aside from some uneven panel gaps, exhibit the telltale signs of a hasty spin through the production line at the Valmet Automotive plant in Finland where Karmas are built."

2012-01-22T00:00:00Z,"CRAWFORD--John Charlton, composer, pianist, professor, beloved father and husband, died on January 5, 2012, at age 80 in his 23rd year of Parkinson's disease in Cambridge, MA. Born the son of academic parents in 1931 in Philadelphia, he was gifted in music and languages. He graduated from Germantown Friends School and the Yale School of Music, and received his Ph.D. from Harvard. He studied composition with Nadia Boulanger in Paris on a Fulbright Fellowship, and further with Paul Hindemith, Quincy Porter, Walter Piston, and Randall Thompson. Harvard awarded him its Boott Prize in choral composition, and its Paine Traveling Fellowship for the study of Arnold Schoenberg's vocal expressionism in Vienna. He and his wife, Dorothy Lamb Crawford, subsequently wrote the first book in English on Expressionism in Twentieth-Century Music (Indiana Univ. Press, 1993), and became performing partners in recitals of a wide range of twentieth-century music for soprano and piano. He taught at Amherst and Wellesley Colleges, and at the University of California, Riverside. His choral compositions were widely performed by such groups as the New England Conservatory Chorus, the Amherst, Harvard, and University of Virginia Glee Clubs, Chorus Pro Musica (Boston), Incarnation Concerts (New York), the Madrigal Singers of both UCLA and the University of Illinois, the St. Louis Chamber Chorus, and the Swarthmore College Choir. His instrumental music has been played by the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Sequoia and Brandeis String Quartets, and the Hartt Chamber Players, among many other groups. His one-act farcical opera, Don Cristobal and Rosita, on a text by Federico Garcia Lorca, was considered ""keenly atmospheric"" in the Boston Globe review of its premiere at Wellesley College in 1970. Another critic, in the Wellesley Alumnae Magazine, mentioned Crawford's ""fine ear for words and a genuine lyrical gift, already apparent to those who know his oratorio [based on T.S. Eliot's] Ash Wednesday, or his many songs...a lively sense of humor, and...a keen instinct for dramatic pacing."" This opera gained performances in Los Angeles and Riverside; his Oratorio was performed at Wellesley College by the Wellesley College Choir and Harvard Glee Club; his Viola Concerto was presented by the Cleveland Chamber Orchestra and the New England Philharmonic; and his Magnificat has been performed countless times. Following his retirement from UC Riverside, where he was chairman of the music department and director of the university's Festival of Contemporary Music, John Crawford returned to Cambridge MA, where he enjoyed participating in the area's rich concert life. He was a member of the Harvard Musical Association, served on the Board of the Lili Boulanger Memorial Fund, and heard his Viola Concerto conducted in its premiere by conductor Richard Pittman with the New England Philharmonic and Bayla Keyes as soloist. He is survived by his son, Peter R., daughter-in-law Glorietta, daughter, Susan P., his granddaughter, Venise, and his wife of fifty-seven years, Dorothy, for whom he composed the opera Don Cristobal and Rosita (1970), Two Shakespeare Sonnets (1969) for soprano and piano, and Calvaries of Love (1980), a dramatic song cycle for soprano, clarinet, cello, and piano on texts and letters of Emily Dickinson. There will be a musical memorial for Dr. Crawford later in 2012."

We moved from Washington Square, where every concert in the park took place in our apartment. (Guests would say, ''Can you turn down the music?''; we would say, ''It's coming from outside.'') Now we live happily in the back of a tall Midtown building, facing north, looking out over the backyards of town houses (there's a skyline view if you stand close to the window, with the tip of the Chrysler Building visible). We painted the walls golden yellow, so it's always sunny. Outside, the corner of 34th and Park is blaringly noisy all day and night. Inside, it's our fourth-floor cabin in the woods."
2012-01-22T00:00:00Z,"FREHSE--Robert M. Robert M. Frehse, Jr.,who was executive director of the Hearst Foundations for nearly three decades, died January 20, in New York. He was 86. Frehse was a consultant to the Hearst Foundations since he retired in June 2007, after serving as executive director since 1979. The Hearst Foundations are composed of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation and The Hearst Foundation, Inc. Both Foundations are independent private philanthropies operating separately from Hearst Corporation. They were established in the mid-1940s by William Randolph Hearst and are guided by the same charitable mission, which reflects his philanthropic interests: education, health, social services and culture. In a joint statement, George R. Hearst, Jr., and William R. Hearst III, presidents respectively of The Hearst Foundation and William Randolph Hearst Foundation, said: ""For 37 years Bob Frehse devoted his working life to the Hearst Foundations. We are grateful for his service, the many relationships he has nurtured and for the high standards of philanthropic management that he put in place. They will serve the organizations for years to come."" ""As the leader of the Hearst Foundations for nearly three decades, Bob was responsible for enabling important, high-quality programs and services for some of the country's most deserving organizations,"" said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., CEO of Hearst Corporation and chairman of the Foundations' Gift Committee. ""He touched so many people's lives. Our thoughts go out to his family."" Frehse first joined the Hearst Foundations in 1975 as director of administration and assistant treasurer, and in 1978 was promoted to vice president and managing director. He was named executive director four years later. Prior to Frehse's tenure at the Foundations, he spent more than 20 years with Citicorp, principally with Citibank's overseas divisions, where he spent 15 years in Latin America and the Caribbean, two years in Hong Kong and the balance in the head office in New York. In his final position with Citicorp, Frehse was manager of marketing coordination for the Asia Pacific and the Western Hemisphere of the Citicorp Subsidiary Group. He was a founding board member of both Grantmakers in Health and the National Foundation Financial Officers Group. Frehse also served as chairman of the board of the Better Business Bureau Foundation in Washington, D.C., and received the Dean's Medal from Tulane University's School of Public Health & Tropical Medicine. Born August 22, 1925, Frehse grew up in Detroit. He was a graduate of Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill., and the American Graduate School of International Management in Phoenix. In World War II, Frehse was a Lieutenant JG in the United States Navy. He is survived by his wife Dale; sons, Robert M. Frehse, III, John W. Frehse, Sr., and William Ladd Frehse; daughters-in-law, Susan Satterfield and Jessica Santostefano; grandson John W. Frehse, Jr.; sister Rosemary Geist; and many nieces and nephews. The funeral service will be held on Saturday, January 28, at 11am, at The Reformed Church of Bronxville, 180 Pondfield Rd., Bronxville, N.Y. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Camp Westminster, a Christian camp founded by Frehse's father in 1925 (17567 Hubbell Ave., Detroit, MI, 48235, 313-341-8969).

Eli Manning's journey started with a draft-day trade, but it then became rather direct: a few solid seasons, then one magical year of upsets and comebacks in 2007. Manning has since borne the ceaseless criticism of those who believe that for a quarterback to achieve adequacy (let alone greatness), every pass must be a 30-yard laser to a receiver's back shoulder, in the corner of the end zone, in the fourth quarter, against the 1985 Chicago Bears. Manning shrugged off the criticism and maintained a level of near-excellence, and he has returned to the brink of the Super Bowl.

2012-01-23T00:00:00Z,"FREHSE--Robert M. Robert M. Frehse, Jr.,who was executive director of the Hearst Foundations for nearly three decades, died January 20, in New York. He was 86. Frehse was a consultant to the Hearst Foundations since he retired in June 2007, after serving as executive director since 1979. The Hearst Foundations are composed of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation and The Hearst Foundation, Inc. Both Foundations are independent private philanthropies operating separately from Hearst Corporation. They were established in the mid-1940s by William Randolph Hearst and are guided by the same charitable mission, which reflects his philanthropic interests: education, health, social services and culture. In a joint statement, George R. Hearst, Jr., and William R. Hearst III, presidents respectively of The Hearst Foundation and William Randolph Hearst Foundation, said: ""For 37 years Bob Frehse devoted his working life to the Hearst Foundations. We are grateful for his service, the many relationships he has nurtured and for the high standards of philanthropic management that he put in place. They will serve the organizations for years to come."" ""As the leader of the Hearst Foundations for nearly three decades, Bob was responsible for enabling important, high-quality programs and services for some of the country's most deserving organizations,"" said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., CEO of Hearst Corporation and chairman of the Foundations' Gift Committee. ""He touched so many people's lives. Our thoughts go out to his family."" Frehse first joined the Hearst Foundations in 1975 as director of administration and assistant treasurer, and in 1978 was promoted to vice president and managing director. He was named executive director four years later. Prior to Frehse's tenure at the Foundations, he spent more than 20 years with Citicorp, principally with Citibank's overseas divisions, where he spent 15 years in Latin America and the Caribbean, two years in Hong Kong and the balance in the head office in New York. In his final position with Citicorp, Frehse was manager of marketing coordination for the Asia Pacific and the Western Hemisphere of the Citicorp Subsidiary Group. He was a founding board member of both Grantmakers in Health and the National Foundation Financial Officers Group. Frehse also served as chairman of the board of the Better Business Bureau Foundation in Washington, D.C., and received the Dean's Medal from Tulane University's School of Public Health & Tropical Medicine. Born August 22, 1925, Frehse grew up in Detroit. He was a graduate of Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill., and the American Graduate School of International Management in Phoenix. In World War II, Frehse was a Lieutenant JG in the United States Navy. He is survived by his wife Dale; sons, Robert M. Frehse, III, John W. Frehse, Sr., and William Ladd Frehse; daughters-in-law, Susan Satterfield and Jessica Santostefano; grandson John W. Frehse, Jr.; sister Rosemary Geist; and many nieces and nephews. The funeral service will be held on Saturday, January 28, at 11am, at The Reformed Church of Bronxville, 180 Pondfield Rd., Bronxville, N.Y. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Camp Westminster, a Christian camp founded by Frehse's father in 1925 (17567 Hubbell Ave., Detroit, MI, 48235, 313-341-8969). Checks can be made to ""Camp Westminster"" with ""The Frehse Fund"" in the memo section."

2012-01-23T00:00:00Z,"The New England Patriots are back in the Super Bowl, despite the best efforts of their opponents and the preferences of millions of fans who are weary of their mix of arrogant excellence and excellent arrogance. The Jets tried to beat them with rhetoric, the Denver Broncos with an Elvis-strength cultural juggernaut, the Baltimore Ravens with everything but a healthy kicker. But nothing could stop Bill Belichick and Tom Brady from returning to the Super Bowl for the fifth time in 11 seasons. Judging by the chip-shot field goal the Ravens missed at the end of the Patriots' 23-20 A.F.C. championship game victory, New England is again augmenting its considerable skill with some timely doses of good luck, the way it did in its rise to dominance a decade ago. The Giants have the power to halt the Patriots in their tracks. But at what cost? The Giants upset them four years ago in Super Bowl XLII and beat them in Week 9, 24-20, but those story lines have already been ground into an unpalatable paste. (Remember, the Green Bay Packers stood in as surrogate Patriots just two games ago, giving us an early round of flashbacks to 2008.) If the Giants can endure two weeks of talk about destiny, miraculous helmet catches and David versus Goliath Redux - if any of us can endure them - they can once again become that rarest of rare breeds: lovable, victorious underdogs from New York."

Born in London in 1917, Jimmy was predeceased by his sister and six brothers. He proudly served in the British army during WWII in the 4th Queen's Own Hussars RAC; and as a Chindit in Burma and India with the 45th Reconnaissance Regiment. Released from H.M. Forces with the rank of Captain in 1947, he went to Israel in 1948, volunteering in the Israeli army in support of the War of Independence. Returning to London, he resumed his medical studies at St. Bart's Hospital, specializing in tropical diseases. He was a physician at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, London; and spent a year as ship's surgeon on the ""City of Exeter"" traveling between England and South Africa. In 1956 he met and married Aileene Hall (nee Fearnley) and together they emigrated to America, settling in New York City, where they lived until 2009. An intern at St. Luke's Hospital and working at Bellevue Hospital and various small clinics throughout the city, Jimmy soon made the decision to resume his studies once again, changing specialty from Tropical Medicine to Psychoanalysis. He was active in private practice until 2003 and was a past president of The American Society of Psychoanalytic Physicians, as well as a devoted member of The Royal Society of Medicine. Jimmy is survived by his wife of 55 years, Aileene, his children Angela, Suzanne, Denise and Alan and their respective families, and numerous nieces and nephews. He was a gentleman, a doctor, and a warrior to the end. He will be sorely missed."

2012-01-23T00:00:00Z,"12:30 P.M. (TMC) CAIRO TIME (2010) In this film by Ruba Nadda, Patricia Clarkson plays Juliette, a magazine writer on her first trip to Egypt, and Alexander Siddig (above, with Ms. Clarkson) is Tareq, a local resident who shows her the views she has promised to save for her husband, a United Nations official delayed in Gaza. ''What gives this delicate, decorous movie its distinctive throb of melancholy sensuality is less the humdrum possibility of adultery than the intimation of a three-way entanglement involving the man, the woman and Cairo,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''The film itself is perhaps a bit too cautious, preferring diffidence and indirection to overt emotion,'' he added. Still, ''the time does pass agreeably enough, and if 'Cairo Time' does not amount to much, it does evoke a wistful state of feeling and a complicated city with enough skill and sensitivity that you wish it had dared more.'' 7:30 A.M. (Fox Movie Channel) SONS AND LOVERS (1960) Jack Cardiff directed this adaptation of the D. H. Lawrence novel about the joy, sorrow and frustration that grow out of a strong bond between a mother (Wendy Hiller) and son (Dean Stockwell) in a northern England coal town, not unlike the one where Lawrence grew up. ''Oddly enough, the powerful passions that race and foam through the original tale, which shocked and dismayed a lot of people when it was published in 1913, do not surge up in the picture,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in The Times. ''The strong possessiveness of a mother's love for a son, transferred to him from his father, comes through as a hot, but essentially lavalike, strain of attentiveness and jealous affection untouched by the thrust of Dr. Freud.'' The film received seven Oscar nominations, including best director for Mr. Cardiff and best actor for Trevor Howard as the discarded father, a miner who wed above his social class. Freddie Francis won for best cinematography, which Mr. Crowther called ''picture poetry.''"
2012-01-23T00:00:00Z,"This is why Hollywood keeps churning out sequels: The fourth movie in Sony's ''Underworld'' vampire series, ''Underworld Awakening,'' was an easy No. 1 at the North American box office over the weekend, taking in about $25.4 million despite winter storms that kept business light in parts of the United States. Solid ticket sales for ''Underworld Awakening'' were fueled by turnout for higher-priced Imax screens. Even so, this 3-D movie will need to perform well overseas to justify its cost of about $70 million, sharply higher than the budget for ''Underworld: Rise of the Lycans'' in 2009. ''Red Tails,'' a period action drama inspired by the Tuskegee airmen, finished a surprisingly strong second, with an estimated $19.1 million in ticket revenue, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. The movie was also expensive: George Lucas spent $58 million to make ''Red Tails'' and spent another $35 million to market it, according to The Hollywood Reporter."

As I looked around, 300 or so people danced and darted back and forth to a free open bar while laser lights shot overhead. Cellphones glowed, like a video of luminescent jellyfish, as people snapped pictures and slung moments of the evening onto dozens of social networks. What made the evening so perplexing was that the party I was attending celebrated Path, a mobile social network that just two months earlier was essentially written off in Silicon Valley. If the company held a party back then, people would have assumed it was a going-out-of-business sale. Now, after rebooting to positive reviews from the blogosphere, Path is again the talk of Silicon Valley. Some are even proclaiming that the company could be ''the next Facebook.''"

2012-01-23T00:00:00Z,"Roger Federer's straight-sets win over Bernard Tomic was filled with long stretches of inspired play from both players. Unlike Rafael Nadal's drubbing of his countryman Feliciano Lopez, which looked like a foregone conclusion early in the first set, the Federer-Tomic match had tense moments throughout, as Federer had to play at his sublime best to beat the rapidly improving Tomic. Federer's tactical variety flummoxed the young Aussie, who, at 19, is already a master tactician. Tomic's genius lies in his ability to out-think his opponent, to hit shots that disrupt rhythm and decision-making ability and to anticipate how and where his opponent is going to hit the ball. He seems to gather information on whom he is playing, then get inside the player's head and break him down with guile, creativity and uncanny anticipation."

In the days before Florida's primary on Jan. 31, Mr. Romney will need to confront the potential breakdown of two pillars of his campaign: that he is the most electable (in exit polls, South Carolina voters saidNewt Gingrich was) and that he is the favorite of those who care about the economy, a title that polls show also went to Mr. Gingrich in the voting on Saturday."

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Ms. Blanchett and her husband, Andrew Upton, would exit as the co-artistic directors of the Sydney Theater Company at the end of their term in 2013, after a run that brought the company international attention, praise and profits. Ms. Blanchett, the Academy Award-winning star of ''The Aviator,'' was seen as a surprisingly high-profile choice when she and Mr. Upton became the company's co-artistic directors in 2009, but their productions, including ''Uncle Vanya'' and ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' were widely respected. The company's ''Streetcar,'' directed by Liv Ullmann and starring Ms. Blanchett as Blanche DuBois, was widely praised; reviewing its production at the BAM Harvey Theater in Brooklyn, Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times, ''Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have performed the play as if it had never been staged before.'' The Morning Herald said that the Sydney Theater Company turned a profit of $607,167 in 2009 and a profit of $919,860 in 2010 after previous years of losses. Patrick McIntyre, the company's general manager, said that Ms. Blanchett and Mr. Upton's time there ''has been a great success,'' and that a new artistic director was being sought to plan a 2014 program."

2012-01-23T00:00:00Z,"The 10th anniversary concert of the Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra couldn't encompass all the ambitions of this remarkable New York institution, even in two generous sets on Friday night that kicked off the group's two-night appearance at Symphony Space. The orchestra, founded and directed by the pianist Arturo O'Farrill, spent its first five years as a resident ensemble at Jazz at Lincoln Center. Now it's independent. Its 18-piece lineup preserves the sound of the great old Latin dance bands, a demanding repertory in itself. But Latin jazz in New York City has always had a progressive, experimental side, fusing with bebop in the 1940s and sparking innovations through the next decades. The orchestra continues that mission, welcoming new compositions that fling wild dissonances and abstruse rhythms into the mix. It also embraces music from across the Americas, old and new, playing all of its diverse material with the same precision and fire it brings to a mambo workout."

Azarenka began to take the ball early and move Radwanska mercilessly from side to side. The normally stingy Radwanska (she committed only 3 unforced errors in her fourth round win over Julia Gorges) began to crumble as Azarenka's heavy groundstrokes found their mark.

2012-01-24T16:50:50Z,"The Shanty, a new bar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that I reviewed this week, serves a whiskey cocktail they call the Lonesome Hero. It's a terrific drink: an old-fashioned variant made with cherry liqueur and the Czech herbal bitters Becherovka. Yet ordering one feels a little bit like getting the salmon at Peter Luger. That's because the Shanty - for the moment, at least - is mostly about the gin. The bar is an annex of the New York Distilling Company, which has been producing two types of gin since November. They're not the only people to do the micro-distilling thing in the borough (there's also the Kings County Distillery and Breuckelen Distilling in Sunset Park), but they're the first with their own bar. The Shanty is clearly more than a gin joint, and no one will push you to order the company's products.

On Sunday, Sotheby's in New York sold her view of livestock, picket fences and clapboarded outbuildings for $1.07 million (the top estimate had been $120,000), setting an auction record for a needlework sampler. The sale contained 198 lots from the collection of the needlework historian Betty Ring. Of all the colorful pastoral views at the Sotheby's showroom, Mary Antrim's piece ''stood out in a unique way as a folk art statement,'' said the dealer David Schorsch, who bought it for an undisclosed client. The auction's other top prices were in the low six figures and shared by the specialist dealers Stephen and Carol Huber and Amy Finkel. A quarter of the Ring material did not sell, especially images of veiled mourners and gravestones sewn in memory of deceased relatives. The buzz in the field this week, Mr. Huber said, is that ''the memorials all died.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

The group's former leader, Luther Campbell, said at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah that the rappers, whose hits like ''Me So Horny'' drew fire, would get back together. ''I just can't wait to start practicing,'' he said. Mr. Campbell, who is 51 and is also known as Luke, visited the festival to promote his appearance in a short film, ''The Life and Freaky Times of Uncle Luke.'' 2 Live Crew popularized the booming hard-driving sound of Miami bass music and was an inventor of ''booty rap,'' which depended on simple, explicit chants and up-tempo grooves, according to the All Music Guide. A federal judge in Florida ruled that the group's 1989 album, ''As Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' was obscene, making it a hot commodity among rap fans, but that ruling was later overturned by a federal appeals court."
2012-01-24T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Gingrich at one point was asked about his contributions to the conservative movement. In answering, he omitted his long history as a self-described liberal ''Rockefeller Republican'' during much of his early adult life and career. Mr. Gingrich instead cited his work for Barry M. Goldwater, the conservative Republican presidential nominee who lost in a landslide in 1964. But at the time, by his own description, Mr. Gingrich was a liberal to moderate Republican, though he would later become widely renowned among conservatives for his role in the party's takeover of Congress in 1994 for the first time in 40 years. Nelson A. Rockefeller was, of course, the Republican governor of New York who lost to Mr.Goldwater in the party's primary in 1964 and was the standardbearer of the party's moderate wing. In a 1989 interview with the Ripon Society, a moderate Republican organization, Mr. Gingrich said, ''There is almost a new synthesis evolving with the classic moderate wing of the party -- where, as a former Rockefeller state chairman, I've spent most of my life -- and the conservative/ activist right wing.'' In 1992, when asked whether President George Bush would ''revert to Rockefeller Republicanism'' if he were re-elected, Mr. Gingrich said: ''Bush has never been a Rockefeller Republican. I have been. In 1968, I was for Rockefeller because he was the most pro-integrationist Republican candidate.''"

2012-01-24T00:00:00Z,"Alzheimer's disease, with its inexorable loss of memory and self, understandably alarms most of us. This is especially so since, at the moment, there are no cures for the condition and few promising drug treatments. But a cautiously encouraging new study from The Archives of Neurology suggests that for some people, a daily walk or jog could alter the risk of developing Alzheimer's or change the course of the disease if it begins. For the experiment, researchers at Washington University in St. Louis recruited 201 adults, ages 45 to 88, who were part of a continuing study at the university's Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Some of the participants had a family history of Alzheimer's, but none, as the study began, showed clinical symptoms of the disease. They performed well on tests of memory and thinking. ''They were, as far as we could determine, cognitively normal,'' says Denise Head, an associate professor of psychology at Washington University who led the study."

2012-01-25T16:08:26Z,"As another fashion season gets underway, the conversation about the relevancy of the runway show continues. Anna Kushnerova and Romain Brau, the duo behind RA, Antwerp's premiere fashion boutique/art gallery/book shop/restaurant, have a firm stance on the issue. ""We find the format static and boring,"" says Brau. And to drive the point home, at RA's new Paris outpost, which opened on the Rue de la Corderie in the third arrondissement this week, designers who share their beef with the industry's standard method of presentation will get a chance to act on their frustrations - sometimes literally. Along with selling luxury fashion such as eveningwear from Serkan Cura and millinery by Nasir Mazhar - a switch from the Antwerp shop, which focuses on avant-garde labels like Siki Im and Bless - Kushnerova and Brau will provide alternatives to formulaic runway shows in the form of theatrically-inspired fashion happenings. ""When we started in Antwerp, the idea was to create a comfortable personal space for ourselves and our community,"" says Kushnerova, who along with Brau was a fashion design student at Antwerp's Royal Academy before embarking on a career in retail. ""With this, we have a more precise vision - we want to really explore the idea of production-based fashion exhibits with music and scenery."" The pair worked with stage and lighting designers, including a scene painter from the Brussels Opera, to create the shop's dramatic interior, which references the art and décor of the 1920s and '30s. The first designer to tread the boards, so to speak, at RA's fashion theater was the Belgian-born Cura, who has worked for the corset maker Mr. Pearl and the designer Jean-Paul Gaultier, and played with the idea of backstage and onstage. ""Part of the collection was shown on dolls,"" says Brau."

The effect, for spring, was sweet, not sultry. Pastel dresses were entirely covered in tulle flowers, metallic embroideries and crystal beading. Since Saab is so well known for his red-carpet columns, it was refreshing to think about how his shorter offerings, all indisputably for evening, could fare on a big night.

In a field of nine best-picture nominees - the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences pegged the number on a sliding scale after experimenting for two years with a list of 10 - ''The Help,'' about race relations; ''War Horse,'' about a fighting horse; ''Moneyball,'' about the business side of baseball; and two surprises, ''The Tree of Life'' and ''Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,'' all found a place.

The estimated date is 1918 due to the lack of birth records. His first memory there was surviving a cholera epidemic from which his mother died. He moved to Isfahan with his father, a religious leader, and they shared a home with a large extended family. His open-minded father had him educated at an English school, Stuart Memorial College. He excelled at math, and graduated early in order to teach there. He subsequently graduated from the University of Tehran. Later, Abul was drafted into the Iranian army, and in the chaos that followed the British sponsored coup against the pro German Shah of Iran (Reza Shah Pahlevi) in 1941; he briefly became acting police chief of Tehran. These circumstances ultimately led to his emigration to the United States. Just after WWII Abul embarked on a journey around the world by sea, finally arriving in San Francisco in 1947, and continuing on to New York, where continued his studies in English and Asian cultures at Columbia University. He completed his Masters degree at the Asia Institute, where he met another student, Marie Hoguet. They were married in 1951 and moved to Chicago where Abul pursued doctoral studies at the University of Chicago. After his return to New York, he became a U.S. citizen, and an anthropology teacher at the American Museum of Natural History, working with Margaret Mead. Abul and Marie raised their four children in Manhattan. Abul is survived by Marie Norton of Manhattan, Jim Khatami of San Francisco, Renee Khatami of Manhattan, Jessie K. Wallen of Del Mar, California, and grandchildren Christopher Khatami, Patrick Norton, Sophie and Emme MacArthur, and John and Jim Wallen. He was buried in Easthampton, New York with his late wife.

Some fans of the 1971 musical about old friendships and unhappy marriages, which has a score by Stephen Sondheim and a book by James Goldman, were rooting for this ''Follies'' to be the one to make money, given that the original Broadway production was a financial flop and the 2001 Broadway revival (by the nonprofit Roundabout Theater Company) had a brief, critically drubbed run."

2012-01-25T00:00:00Z,"The Weather Channel Companies, which owns the Weather Channel, replaced its leadership on Tuesday, and named the digital advertising veteran David Kenny its chairman and chief executive. Mr. Kenny will start immediately. Michael J. Kelly, who had been the chief executive since 2009, will become a special adviser to the company and an adviser to Bain Capital, the private equity firm that co-owns the company with the Blackstone Group and Comcast's NBCUniversal. The surprise change signaled a desire on the part of the co-owners to expand the Weather Channel's digital and mobile businesses more quickly. Through mobile apps and Web sites like Weather.com, the company sees an opportunity to have a much bigger international footprint. ''Six and a half billion people need information about weather,'' Mr. Kenny said in an interview Tuesday after addressing the company's staff in Atlanta. Mr. Kenny also said that the company would make more investments in long-form programming - part of a gradual move away from live weather news and toward taped weather-related reality shows. ''Now that people can get the information they need for their forecast off the Web, and certainly on their mobile phone, that gives us more license to do more long-form on the cable channel,'' he said. The channel remained committed to live news during severe weather, he added. Mr. Kenny, a member of the board of directors of Yahoo, was the president of Akamai until he stepped down last October. He was previously the co-founder of VivaKi, a digital agency that is part of the Publicis Groupe. In a statement, the three co-owners of the Weather Channel said that Mr. Kenny's experience ''gives him a deep understanding of the TV and digital business, and he has the leadership experience and vision to drive global initiatives across all platforms.'' Mr. Kelly, similarly, had a digital media background when he was hired two and a half years ago. Mr. Kenny said he was initially recruited to join the board of the company, and was later asked by the board to consider the chief executive position. ''What I've long stood for is convergence,'' he said. ''I think you'll see us find better ways to run the Weather Channel as one company, really organized around our hundreds of millions of users.'' NBCUniversal and the private equity firms have owned the Weather Channel since 2008. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

A bevy of designers showed the jackets, so synonymous with 1980s power dressing, in their resort collections, including Theyskens' Theory, with versions in silk and linen; Ferragamo, which showed nautically inspired looks; Sonia Rykiel; Band of Outsiders; and Robert Rodriguez. Ahead-of-the-curve street-style favorites like Lauren Santo Domingo (in the pink jacket), Olivia Palermo (in white) and Caroline Issa (in gray) have already adopted the D-B look.

She likes to pair the jackets with something feminine: ''A pussy-bow blouse, a short skirt or a bunch of chunky bracelets with the sleeves rolled up. And sharp stilettos! Those always look good with a D-B suit.''"

But the film itself continues to stir up controversy, renewing a heated debate about the prime minister's legacy. John F. Burns, our colleague on the foreign desk, visited Ms. Thatcher's birthplace, Grantham, England, and the Reel Cinema there, and found that ""for every resident who spoke admiringly of the way 'Mrs. T' handled the big issues - the battles with the unions, the retrenchment of the postwar welfare state, the Falklands war, the cold war confrontation with the Soviet Union - there were two or three others who disparaged her as too bossy, too uncaring toward society's have-nots and too little interested in tending to her Grantham roots.""

2012-01-27T00:00:00Z,"SEMANS--Mary Duke Biddle Trent, a lifelong philanthropist and civic leader in North Carolina, died on January 25, 2012, in Durham. She was 91. She devoted herself to education, children's services, health care and the arts, and her compassion for others helped shape and sustain significant programs and institutions across the Carolinas and the nation. She was born into a family of industrialists and philanthropists. Her grandfather, Benjamin Newton Duke, his brother, James B. Duke, and their father, Washington Duke, were involved in many business ventures, the most significant of which were the American Tobacco Company and Duke Power Company, now Duke Energy Corporation. Over the years, they were the chief benefactors of Trinity College in Durham, NC, which later became Duke University. In 1924, James B. Duke established The Duke Endowment in Charlotte, one of the largest private foundations in the country and the largest foundation in the Southeast. Mrs. Semans carried on the family legacy through her own foundations and philanthropic work. She was a Trustee of The Duke Endowment for 55 years, and served as its first female Chairman from 1982-2001. After 2001, she continued serving as Chair Emerita. She also served as a Trustee of many educational institutions in the Carolinas, including Duke University, Davidson College, Shaw University, Louisburg College, Converse College and the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. She was instrumental in establishing the Duke University Museum of Art, which became the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, and the museum's Great Hall bears her name. Mrs. Semans was born in New York City. Her parents were Mary Duke Biddle, the only daughter of Benjamin Duke, and Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr., a General in the United States Army. Her mother was a noted philanthropist who carried on the family's support of Duke University and her father held several high-level government posts, including Ambassador to Exiled Countries during World War II and Ambassador to Spain. Apart from a childhood in New York City, Mrs. Semans lived most of her life in Durham. She attended the Hewitt School in New York and then enrolled in the Woman's College at Duke University at age 15. In 1938, she married Josiah Trent, a surgical intern who would become the chief of Duke Hospital's division of thoracic surgery. Dr. Trent died of cancer after 10 years of marriage. As a young widow and mother of four girls, she ran for a seat on the Durham City Council and became the first woman elected in 1951. She served as mayor pro-tem from 1953-55. She married James H. Semans, a Duke University surgeon and urologist, in 1953. In their 52 years of marriage, they had three children. Mrs. Semans, along with her husband, took active roles in public service. In the 1960s, they helped lead the establishment of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, the nation's first state-supported conservatory for the arts. Mrs. Semans served as a Trustee of the school for more than 20 years. Mrs. Semans also served on the board of the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation, established by her mother to support arts, educational and charitable initiatives in North Carolina and New York City. In 1971, the couple received the North Carolina Award for their contributions to the fine arts. The couple also received the National Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews for distinguished service in the field of human relations. Dr. Semans died in 2005 at age 94. Mrs. Semans served on the boards of the Executive Mansion Fine Arts Committee; the North Carolina Museum of Art; the North Carolina Symphony; the North Carolina Center for World Languages and Cultures; the Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University; and the National Humanities Center. She also served as chairman of the Governor's Study Committee on Vocational Rehabilitation and was a member of the National Citizens Advisory Commission on Vocational Rehabilitation, appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Mrs. Semans also served as a member of the board of directors of First Union Corporation. In 1986, she received one of the first two University Medals for Distinguished Meritorious Service at Duke. Her honorary degrees came from Duke, Campbell University, Davidson College, Elon University, Furman University, N.C. Central University, North Carolina Wesleyan College, Pfeiffer University, Shaw University and UNC Chapel Hill. Mrs. Semans received many other honors and awards including the National Governors Association Distinguished Service Award for her support of the arts; a Citation for Distinguished Public Service presented by North Carolina Citizens for Business and Industry; the Humanitarian Freedom Award presented by the Durham Chapter of Hadassah; the North Carolina Philanthropy Award; and the North Caroliniana Society Award. She received the Meritorious Service Award from the North Carolina Hospital Association in 2006 and in 2009 she was inducted into the North Carolina Women's Hall of Fame.

(49) TONY BENNETT: DUETS II Soon after his 85th birthday on Aug. 3, Mr. Bennett released ''Duets II,'' the follow-up to his Grammy-winning album ''Duets: An American Classic,'' made in honor of his 80th. ''Duets II'' started atop the Billboard 200 chart, making Mr. Bennett the oldest artist to reach No. 1. This ''Great Performances'' presentation captures recording sessions in Los Angeles, London, New York, Nashville and at the home of Andrea Bocelli in Italy. It also features performances including ''Body and Soul,'' with Amy Winehouse, in what would be her last recorded track; ''The Lady Is a Tramp,'' with Lady Gaga (above, with Mr. Bennett); ''Speak Low,'' with Norah Jones; ''The Way You Look Tonight,'' with Faith Hill; ''It Had to Be You,'' with Carrie Underwood; and ''On the Sunny Side of the Street,'' with Willie Nelson. ''Duets II'' has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, including for best pop duo/group. 7:15 A.M. (IFC) LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE (2006) Abigail Breslin, right, received an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of the unlikely preteen princess Olive Hoover in this comedy about a family of misfits determined to get a 7-year-old to a beauty pageant. Alan Arkin won an Oscar for best supporting actor as the heroin-snorting grandfather who helps put Olive's talent routine over the top. Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette play the parents driving the ravaged family and its equally dilapidated Volkswagen bus.

2012-01-27T00:00:00Z,"GIEGERICH--Lester R. 96. FINANCIER Lester Ralph Giegerich of Darien, who developed some of the first shopping centers in California, died in the early morning of Tuesday, January 17, at Norwalk Hospital. He was 96 and still active in his real estate development and management business until the last two weeks of his life. Born May 22, 1915, he was raised in New Providence, NJ. ""Les"" Giegerich went to the University of Pennsylvania on full scholarship and graduated from the Wharton School of Commerce & Finance in 1940. He then moved to Missouri where he met and married Betty Louise Bradley of Kansas City in 1941. He served as a World War II Air Force flight instructor for five years at Kelley Field in Texas where he rose to the rank of major. After the war, Mr. Giegerich worked for Merrill Lynch in Kansas City followed by four years with Traveler's Insurance Co. as assistant manager of the City Mortgage Loan Department. He then moved on to head up the Mortgage Loan & Real Estate Department of Teacher's Insurance & Annuity Association in New York City from 1950-54. He was a pioneer in the sale and leaseback transactions and mortgage banking with his partner Sidney M. Barton of New York. In 1960 he started his own company, the Giegerich Co., in Westport, where he lived with his wife and two daughters. During his 60 years as one of the country's most active experts in leasebacks, Mr. Giegerich developed some of the first shopping centers in California with partners Earnest W. Hahn, Linn C. Alexander and Gerry L. Moss -- all pioneers in the industry. One of his earliest projects was the Spanish-styled La Cumbre in Santa Barbara. Not only did his company develop shopping centers, but it also financed numerous office and industrial buildings throughout the U.S. Additionally, the Giegerich Co. conducted a mortgage banking business through 1986. In 1977, after his first wife died, Mr. Giegerich married Lillian Ransco Roney of Darien, formerly of Rochester, NY, and moved to Darien. In Fairfield County, Mr. Giegerich served on many boards including the Westport YMCA, the Westport Library, the Norwalk Housing Association, and the Maritime Aquarium. He was a generous donor to these organizations as well as the Westport Saugatuck Congregational Church, the Norwalk Hospital and the University of Pennsylvania. Known affectionately as Mr. G. in his office, Les Giegerich was a humanist, always interested in people and their lives. An inspiration to all, he was generous with his time and talent. Drawing from his innate common sense and wide perspective, Les was an educator; he was known to offer advice to many, particularly to those who were just starting out in their careers. Open-minded with many interests, Les lived life fully. He travelled to all the continents (at least twice) and had few wonders of the world left to see. He read widely, and especially loved history books and biographies. His athletic abilities lasted into his early '90s during which he still enjoyed skiing, tennis and swimming, but above all, golf. He is survived by his wife of 35 years, Lillian Giegerich; his sister, Marion Snyder of New Providence, N.J.; his two daughters, Brenda K. Giegerich of Westport, CT and Marsha G. Torkelson of Mill Valley, CA.; his step-daughter Joan Roney of New York City and his step-son John Roney of Darien; three grandchildren, Justin Torkelson, Bretton Torkelson and Eloise Giegerich and two newly born great-granddaughters Mia and Elle.

He is survived by his wife, Francoise, their five children, Christine, Florence, Sylvie, Francois and Anne-Sophie, their spouses and partner, Xavier, Vincent, Robert, Ketty and Sophie, their eleven grandchildren and their spouses, and their ten great-grandchildren.

In 1948, after graduating from the prestigious Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, he joined IBM, and he and Francoise moved to the US for what would be the first of four long stays there. His career at IBM spanned 36 years, and would culminate in his becoming Chairman and CEO of IBM World Trade Corporation, and a member of the Board of IBM Corporation. A true French patriot, he was a champion of French-American friendship, and a passionate supporter of Europe. In parallel to his business career, he was a tireless promoter of ""world peace through world trade"".

In 1986, he was called to duty by the French government, and served as Director General of Industry.

Egmont Press, the publisher of the novel, said it had sold about 950,000 copies between the opening of the play and last fall. The play is still running in London and New York, and productions are planned for Melbourne, Australia, and Toronto. This week the film was nominated for six Academy Awards including best picture.

2012-01-28T00:00:00Z,"SEMANS--Mary Duke Biddle Trent, a lifelong philanthropist and civic leader in North Carolina, died on January 25, 2012, in Durham. She was 91. She devoted herself to education, children's services, health care and the arts, and her compassion for others helped shape and sustain significant programs and institutions across the Carolinas and the nation. She was born into a family of industrialists and philanthropists. Her grandfather, Benjamin Newton Duke, his brother, James B. Duke, and their father, Washington Duke, were involved in many business ventures, the most significant of which were the American Tobacco Company and Duke Power Company, now Duke Energy Corporation. Over the years, they were the chief benefactors of Trinity College in Durham, NC, which later became Duke University. In 1924, James B. Duke established The Duke Endowment in Charlotte, one of the largest private foundations in the country and the largest foundation in the Southeast. Mrs. Semans carried on the family legacy through her own foundations and philanthropic work. She was a Trustee of The Duke Endowment for 55 years, and served as its first female Chairman from 1982-2001. After 2001, she continued serving as Chair Emerita. She also served as a Trustee of many educational institutions in the Carolinas, including Duke University, Davidson College, Shaw University, Louisburg College, Converse College and the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. She was instrumental in establishing the Duke University Museum of Art, which became the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, and the museum's Great Hall bears her name. Mrs. Semans was born in New York City. Her parents were Mary Duke Biddle, the only daughter of Benjamin Duke, and Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr., a General in the United States Army. Her mother was a noted philanthropist who carried on the family's support of Duke University and her father held several high-level government posts, including Ambassador to Exiled Countries during World War II and Ambassador to Spain. Apart from a childhood in New York City, Mrs. Semans lived most of her life in Durham. She attended the Hewitt School in New York and then enrolled in the Woman's College at Duke University at age 15. In 1938, she married Josiah Trent, a surgical intern who would become the chief of Duke Hospital's division of thoracic surgery. Dr. Trent died of cancer after 10 years of marriage. As a young widow and mother of four girls, she ran for a seat on the Durham City Council and became the first woman elected in 1951. She served as mayor pro-tem from 1953-55. She married James H. Semans, a Duke University surgeon and urologist, in 1953. In their 52 years of marriage, they had three children. Mrs. Semans, along with her husband, took active roles in public service. In the 1960s, they helped lead the establishment of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, the nation's first state-supported conservatory for the arts. Mrs. Semans served as a Trustee of the school for more than 20 years. Mrs. Semans also served on the board of the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation, established by her mother to support arts, educational and charitable initiatives in North Carolina and New York City. In 1971, the couple received the North Carolina Award for their contributions to the fine arts. The couple also received the National Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews for distinguished service in the field of human relations. Dr. Semans died in 2005 at age 94. Mrs. Semans served on the boards of the Executive Mansion Fine Arts Committee; the North Carolina Museum of Art; the North Carolina Symphony; the North Carolina Center for World Languages and Cultures; the Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University; and the National Humanities Center. She also served as chairman of the Governor's Study Committee on Vocational Rehabilitation and was a member of the National Citizens Advisory Commission on Vocational Rehabilitation, appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Mrs. Semans also served as a member of the board of directors of First Union Corporation. In 1986, she received one of the first two University Medals for Distinguished Meritorious Service at Duke. Her honorary degrees came from Duke, Campbell University, Davidson College, Elon University, Furman University, N.C. Central University, North Carolina Wesleyan College, Pfeiffer University, Shaw University and UNC Chapel Hill. Mrs. Semans received many other honors and awards including the National Governors Association Distinguished Service Award for her support of the arts; a Citation for Distinguished Public Service presented by North Carolina Citizens for Business and Industry; the Humanitarian Freedom Award presented by the Durham Chapter of Hadassah; the North Carolina Philanthropy Award; and the North Caroliniana Society Award. She received the Meritorious Service Award from the North Carolina Hospital Association in 2006 and in 2009 she was inducted into the North Carolina Women's Hall of Fame. Mrs. Semans is survived by seven children: Mary Trent Jones of Abingdon, VA; Sarah Trent Harris of Charlotte, NC; Dr. Rebecca Trent Kirkland of Houston, Texas; Barbara Trent Kimbrell of Sullivan's Island, SC; Jenny Semans Koortbojian of Durham, NC; James Duke Biddle Trent Semans of Chapel Hill, NC; and Beth Semans Hubbard of Los Angeles, CA; 16 grandchildren and 29 great-grandchildren.

2012-01-29T00:00:00Z,"LINDSAY--Robert Van Cleef (Rod) of Manhattan, NY, and Wellington, FL, and former President of J.P. Morgan & Co., Inc. and its principle subsidiary, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, died peacefully of complications from pneumonia at the age of 86 in West Palm Beach, FL, surrounded by family, in the hospice wing of Good Samaritan Hospital. He died just after the stroke of midnight, Friday, January 20, 2012. Born just after the stroke of midnight, January 1st, 1926, Rod was the son of George Nelson Lindsay and Florence Eleanor Vliet Lindsay of New York City and Oyster Bay. The youngest of five, he attended Buckley School and graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, NH in 1943. He served in the U.S. Merchant Marine and the U.S. Army Transportation Corps, enlisting when he was seventeen. Upon his return, he attended Yale University, where he majored in Spanish Literature. He graduated from Yale in 1949 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. In 1950, Rod wed Nancy Adams Dalley, the beautiful sister of his close friend Larry Dalley. He was the devoted father of daughters Cammy (Robert E. Justice) and Tinker Lindsay, and son Robert D. Lindsay (Teresa Elms Lindsay); beloved grandfather of Jon and Drew Warkentin, Thomas and Dorothy Beatty, and Roddy, Pitch, Alec and Duncan Lindsay, and delighted great-grandfather of Adeline and Daisy Pidduck. Rod was predeceased by his wife, Nancy, three older brothers, George Nelson, John Vliet, and David Alexander Lindsay, and his older sister, Eleanor Lindsay Schieffelin. He maintained close connections until his own death with his widespread extended family. In 1949, Rod joined J.P. Morgan & Co., Inc., where he spent his entire career. He became a Vice-President in 1960, and Senior Vice-President in 1969. In 1973, he was named General Manager of Morgan Guaranty's London Offices. Elected Executive Vice-President in 1976, he returned to New York. In 1978 he became Chairman of the Executive Committee and a Director of the holding company. In 1980, he was elected President. He retired in 1986 to pursue his many other interests. Rod served as a Director of Russell Reynolds Corporation, Chubb Corporation, Fluor Corporation, First Hudson Valley Bank, J.P. Morgan (Suisse) S.A. and as U.S. Adviser to Unibank Denmark AlS, Copenhagen. He was a member of the International Council of Insitut European d'Administration des Affaires (INSEAD), the Conference Board, the International Monetary Conference, and the Council of Ditchley and Cooperation Ireland. Rod gave generously of his time to numerous nonprofit organizations. He was Chairman of the Foreign Policy Association, served for twenty years as the Director of the New York Philharmonic Society and six years as Chairman of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. He was Treasurer of the Long Island Biological Association and a founding board member of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He was a trustee of the ASPCA, the National Board of the Smithsonian Associates, Cooper Union, East Woods School, and St. Paul's School. He served as Treasurer of the Downtown Lower Manhattan Association, and founding director of the New York City Development Corp. Purebred dogs played a prominent role in Rod's life. He and Nancy were very active in the dog show world, breeding and showing Basset Hounds and Bloodhounds out of their Lime Tree Kennels. Rod served as President and longtime AKC Delegate for the American Bloodhound Club, and President of the Long Island Kennel Club. In addition, Rod was the longest standing member of the Westminster Kennel Club - a member since 1959 and served as president of the WKC from 1969-1972. He also served as vice resident four times, as vice chair of the show committee, and as Chief ring steward for many years. He was a trustee of Westminster Kennel Foundation, which he helped to create. In 2011, the Westminster members awarded him its prestigious Sensation Award for his contributions to the club. Rod had numerous other interests, including jazz, chamber music, fly-fishing, opera, travel, carriage driving, show jumping, art collecting, horse breeding, reading, and collecting first editions of authors such as E. Phillips Oppenheim and Ludwig Bemelmens. Rod was a faithful member of the Episcopal Church, and a loyal parishioner wherever he lived. A student of both history and human nature, Rod avoided politics, but was active in his older brother John's eight-year tenure as Mayor of New York. Yet all of these passions paled in comparison to his devotion to his wife, Nancy, to whom he was married for fifty-eight years. During their long, full life together, they set up households all over the world, moving over a dozen times. Wherever they landed, their home quickly became a magnet for great food, drink, music and conversation among multi-generational friends from every walk of life. In 2008, Nancy succumbed to a brain tumor, which she had valiantly fought for a decade. Rod remained devoted to her and her care even as he fought Parkinson's Disease for the better part of fifteen years himself. Following her death he moved back into Manhattan one last time to revisit the vibrant city where he was born, reacquainting himself with jazz at Dizzy's, mussels at La Mangeoire, and Shepherd's Pie at Parnell's, and organizing various gatherings and reunions at his much loved Yale, Links and Leash Clubs. Rod's modest demeanor belied his many talents. He was a brilliant thinker, consummate storyteller, and voracious reader, and routinely completed the Times Sunday Crossword puzzle in record time, in ink. A true Renaissance man, Rod displayed a rare combination of intelligence, loyalty, humility, humor and practicality. He had impeccable judgment regarding people, places and things, without ever being judgmental. He died peacefully and painlessly, looking forward to rejoining his beloved Nancy. A memorial service will be held at St. James' Church, 865 Madison Avenue, New York, NY, at 11am on Saturday, March 3rd, 2012. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to St. Paul's School, 325 Pleasant Street, Concord, NH 03301; The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, 70 Lincoln Center Plaza, New York, NY 10023; or The Westminster Kennel Foundation, 149 Madison Ave., Suite 402, New York, NY 10016."
2012-01-29T00:00:00Z,"IN Milwaukee, a city best known for its blue-collar roots, an artistic side is starting to emerge, particularly in an area known as the Third Ward. In the mid-19th century, the port city was known for its high volume of wheat trade before becoming a machine shop for the world. Immigrants -- mostly Italian and Irish -- settled in the Third Ward, thanks to its proximity to the city's docks and factories. In 1892, a huge fire destroyed most of the neighborhood. Though it made a modest comeback over the next decades as the city's Little Italy, by the 1960s, expressway construction through the area sent many of its remaining residents packing. Led by the Historic Third Ward Association, revitalization efforts over the past few years have transformed the district into a cultural magnet. Galleries now share blocks with design boutiques, trendy cafes and a public market. And a boardwalk that runs along Milwaukee River, a continuing project that saw a major portion completed in 2005, gives the area a distinctly European flair. STEPHANIE DAVILA"

Rosi was born in Vienna and studied at the State Academy of Music together with her sister Toni, who died almost exactly five years ago. Rosi came to the United States in 1939. It was in 1940 that Olin Downes, the distinguished critic of The New York Times heard the sisters play at Steinway Hall and encouraged them to pursue a career as duo-pianists. Their playing was characterized by a seamless blending of two distinct personalities which produced a complete musical unity. Their programs showed a wide range of styles from the classical repertoire to compositions by contemporary composers. Some works were written especially for them. A documentary entitled ""Toni & Rosi,"" an account of their long life together is scheduled to be broadcasted on Sunday, January 29th on BBC4 Television. Rosi will be greatly missed and long remembered by her family, friends and students."
2012-01-29T00:00:00Z,"More than a century after men first boxed in the modern Olympics, women will finally get a shot, when their sport makes its Olympic debut at the London Games this summer. For American hopefuls, the next step in the long gantlet of getting there takes place a couple of weeks from now outside Spokane, Wash., at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials. Twenty-four women will compete; three will survive. Those three -- one boxer each from the flyweight (112 pounds), lightweight (132 pounds) and middleweight (165 pounds) divisions -- will then advance to the Women's World Championships in May in Qinhuangdao, China. The top eight in their weight classes there will take their fight to London. Olympic bouts will consist of four two-minute rounds, compared with three three-minute rounds for the men. Tiara Brown, one of the trialists on these pages, probably speaks for her fellow contenders when she says: ''I'm not a girl boxer. I'm just a boxer. I'm not doing this for women. I want to be treated the way the guys are treated. Not special because I'm a girl.''"

2012-01-29T00:00:00Z,"COLE--Benjamin S. Benjamin S. Cole (Ben) passed from this life at the age of 87 on January 4, 2012 at his home in Boston, Massachusetts in the loving arms of his wife of forty-one years, Rose Marie Cole (nee Cupit); surviving from his previous marriage are his three sons Jonathan, Daniel and William Cole, and two daughters Louise Nicollet and Virginia Starr Cole; as well as eleven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Mr. Cole was born on June 28, 1924 to Rachel and Louis Cohen in Brooklyn, New York where he graduated with honors from Boys' High School and at the age of sixteen was director of the radio show ""Student Workshop"". During his junior year at university, Ben enlisted in the US Army. He graduated from Officer Candidate School in the late summer of 1944 and proudly served as a Lieutenant under Colonel Guinn Goodrich in the 18th Tank Battalion of the Eighth Armored Division. Ben was awarded the Bronze Star for his service in the Battle of the Bulge and served for another eighteen months in the occupation, after which, he returned to his studies and graduated with honors from New York University. Ben was a visionary and an entrepreneur all his life, with an intuitive knack for recognizing human potential. During his early years, after the war, he worked as a labor arbitrator for several companies. In the 1950's he founded US Transfer, an executive search firm. Later in the decade, he went on to found Cole & Associates, which started as a management consulting firm. Ben broke new ground in the field of management consulting by focusing on family-owned businesses, though he later branched out into the broader arena of management counseling, while continuing the search activities. Another division, Cole Surveys, was started in the early 1960's. Cole Surveys revolutionized data gathering and analysis for bank officer compensation by developing and adopting database management techniques through the use of early computing. The annual release of the Bank Officer Salary Survey was awaited with anticipation and considered the ""compensation bible"" of the industry garnering the business of all the top one hundred US banks and thousands of others in the United States and abroad. A successful enterprise, Cole & Associates, Inc. was acquired in 1975 by the Wyatt Corporation. The framework of the acquisition exists today as part of Towers Watson Data Services. Ben served as a Director and Vice President of Wyatt, and President of the acquired entity, while continuing to lead important compensation consulting engagements until 1989, when he retired. Unlike many, Ben looked at retirement as just another opportunity to engage his entrepreneurial thinking. First, he started Ben S. Cole Financial Incorporated (Cole Financial) serving as a consultant in corporate governance to many major banking institutions in the United States and abroad. Additionally, he saw the breakdown of the Soviet Union, and its return to a Russian Federation of states as a frontier filled with promise. To enable his vision, he founded, and was CEO and Chairman of Cole Management Incorporated (CMI), a Boston-based investment company aimed at investing in and growing businesses in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. Through CMI, he served on a blue ribbon panel appointed by the office of the Mayor of St. Petersburg to consider major infrastructure projects for the city. At the request of Mayor Sobchak, Ben developed a restructuring plan for the Bank of Leningrad in connection with its privatization one of the first bank privatizations in the Soviet Union. Mr. Cole began investing in Russian entities in the early 1990's. Most importantly, he participated in investments in Russia's technology sector, including investments in Yandex, CompTek International and InfiNet Wireless Ltd. At Yandex, the leading internet search company in Russia, he was a non-executive director from 2000 2012 and served as the Chairman of their board of directors from 2000 until July 2008, when he became Chairman Emeritus. Upon learning of Ben's passing, Arkady Volozh, CEO of Yandex, wrote, ""As one of our founding directors, Ben was a guiding force for our company. We will greatly miss his leadership, business acumen and friendship. Our hearts go out to Ben's wife, Rose and his family."" Ben was a man of great faith and boundless energy, compelled to make a positive contribution to the world. He had a profound and endearing effect on others. Ben's great warmth and vision, fun loving, compassionate, tenacious and loyal disposition made him a great mentor, advocate and friend. Ben loved fine art, music and literature. He had a beautiful voice and blessed many with his singing. His passion for life, for humanity itself was boundless. He never stopped challenging himself and serving others. A private Burial Service with military honors was held at Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, MA. A Memorial Service to honor Ben's life is planned, date to be announced. In honor of Ben's profound wish, please make donations to fund pancreatic cancer research, c/o The Benjamin S. Cole Charitable Foundation - PRIA, Citizens Bank, Michael J.

2012-01-29T00:00:00Z,"ELBERG--Gail. The All Stars Project is deeply saddened by the passing of one of our foremost groundbreakers, Gail Elberg. Gail devoted her life to organizing in poor communities to bring about positive social change. Born in Brooklyn in 1948, she became a VISTA volunteer on the Fallon Indian Reservation in Nevada. In the 1970s, in the midst of New York City's devastating fiscal crisis, she was a pioneer organizer of the New York City Unemployed and Welfare Council. This 10,000-member union of the poor was the first to seek collective bargaining rights for welfare recipients. Later, she would focus her extraordinary organizing talents on creating an award-winning volunteer program for the All Stars Project. She involved thousands of people from all walks of life, rich and poor and everyone in between; providing them with creative opportunities to give back to the city's most disempowered and disadvantaged communities. Gail was a powerful public advocate for volunteerism, serving on the boards of the NY Association for Volunteer Administration and the Association of Leaders in Volunteer Engagement. Under her direction, the All Stars volunteer program won the National Points of Light Award and was designated by Mutual of New York as the best volunteer site for working people. A tireless champion of the underdog, Gail battled a brain tumor for two and a half years, showing the same boundless energy and optimism with which she lived her life. Her incredible community organizing skills, her keen intelligence and her offbeat sense of humor made her admired and loved by everyone she touched. She will be so deeply missed. Gabrielle L.

It was heart failure, not cancer. The article also referred imprecisely to Ms. Smith's life in the 1980s. While ''she lived through the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in New York,'' she did so in the sense of living through that experience, which included the death of her friend Robert Mapplethorpe; she did not physically live in New York.

2012-01-29T00:00:00Z,"DURING the Armani couture show the other day, I kept glancing across the runway at Jessica Chastain. Probably many people were, and all with the same thought: does she see a dress she might like to wear to the Oscar ceremony? No doubt Mr. Armani will be happy to make her something. Ms. Chastain learned she had been nominated for ''The Help'' just before the show started. People around her applauded. Maybe in all the excitement everything looked blurry. The process of picking a dress for the Oscars is a mystery to me, and I'm glad no one ever asks me for advice. I'd tell an actress to wear an incredibly simple Yohji Yamamoto dress, something chic but completely under the radar -- and, well, even I know that would never fly on the red carpet. Stylists have to deal with the politics of top houses (and a fair number of unsolicited offers), and, equally, houses have to deal with stylists and stars who often have quite different agendas. I'm not sure why we don't see more couture at the Oscars, though I'm told it's because the houses don't want to make something so costly if an actress and her stylist aren't willing to commit to a dress."

Yet for the most part, the cars sold within, and often even exceeded, those ambitious estimates. It wasn't just the top of the collector car market that did well. The middle of the market and the entry level showed strength, too -- enough that it's difficult to peg exactly where the entry level is these days. Here are five examples that offer some context to the trends seen in Scottsdale this year. All prices include the buyer's premium."

It's not as if they haven't had a long relationship already, with each regularly borrowing stories and stars from the other. But now these separate but equal art forms are attempting to practice cohabitation. As in many relationships, only half of the couple is truly equipped to make the effort. Film, after all, is recorded action and exists mostly in two dimensions (even when it's 3-D), which means it can't invite live theater into its world. On the other hand, there's nothing to stop theater artists from setting up a projector and showing a movie onstage, letting live performers interact with, or ignore, their two-dimensional equivalents."

2012-01-29T00:00:00Z,"CASTELLANO--Peter Maurice 62, passed away at his home in Atlantic Beach, FL on January 24, 2012 after a lengthy illness. Peter was born on February 14, 1949 in Brooklyn, NY to parents Michael and Elyane ""Lana"" Castellano. He attended St. Sylvester's Roman Catholic Grade School where he also served as an altar boy at Sunday masses. He attended Thomas Jefferson High School. Peter found his calling as a professional photographer when he was just a boy and his Uncle Charlie gave him a camera. This sparked his creative interest in photography and he pursued that as a career, which spanned over 35 years. Peter became a well-known fashion photographer both in Europe and the United States in the 1970's. He studied under Guy Bourdain and Gustav Petersen and was touted as the ""next Scavullo"" in the early 1980's. He worked with some of the finest art directors in the business.

2012-01-29T00:00:00Z,"Last October, in Foshan, China, a 2-year-old girl was run over by a van. The driver did not stop. Over the next seven minutes, more than a dozen people walked or bicycled past the injured child. A second truck ran over her. Eventually, a woman pulled her to the side, and her mother arrived. The child died in a hospital. The entire scene was captured on video and caused an uproar when it was shown by a television station and posted online. A similar event occurred in London in 2004, as have others, far from the lens of a video camera. Yet people can, and often do, behave in very different ways."

2012-01-29T00:00:00Z,"Across the waiting room in the doctor's office, a woman is generously showering each page of last month's Newsweek with wet coughs. Her expression is a dutiful one, like that of a priest sprinkling holy water upon his congregation; occasionally she flips back to bestow a second layer where the first might have been too thin. The man sitting next to me is browsing a copy of Men's Health. When the nurse calls his name, he smiles and offers me the magazine. I recoil. Touching its communal pages would be the equivalent of having unprotected sex with multiple strangers in a Porta-John. I manage a terse, ''No, thank you,'' then immediately begin to worry that he thinks I refused it because I'm illiterate. Or maybe he thinks I'm not simply illiterate but also stupid, that I thought illiteracy was actually a medical condition and that instead of going to an adult education center I came to the doctor's office. Next time someone offers me a magazine in a doctor's office, I decide, I'll decline by saying, ''I've already read that one.''"

Last week's first-place film, ''Underworld: Awakening'' (Sony Pictures Entertainment), was second with about $12.5 million in ticket sales, lifting its two-week total to $45.1 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. The comedy ''One for the Money,'' starring Katherine Heigl in an adaptation of Janet Evanovich's best-selling novel, was soft but better-than-expected in third place, taking in about $11.8 million. The African-American military adventure ''Red Tails'' (LucasFilm via 20th Century Fox) was fourth, with an estimated $10.4 million in sales for a two-week total of $33.8 million.

He had chosen his most contemplative songs, with sustained melodies like lullabies grown operatic, carrying lyrics to proclaim and repeat revelations: ''I need another world/This one's nearly gone.'' Mr. Hegarty, draped in a white garment -- part diva dress, part Jesus robe -- stood at center stage, alone until the orchestra was revealed late in the concert.

''He's a child, and she's the man of the family,'' Mr. Sorrentino explained, adding that the story was based on his own relationship and also that of Mr. Smith, who has been married to the same woman since he was 16. Iggy Pop was another source of rock inspiration, and David Byrne supplies music and makes a cameo. Mr. Penn even sang a Cure-like song in the movie, but the scene was cut because his co-star for the scene, a dog, didn't behave, Mr. Sorrentino said."

The 1920s teams are not included because of severe differences in the game and the league. In this installment, we rank the running back tandems, whether they are rotations, committees, or old-fashioned three-back attacks. For the teams of yesteryear, ""tailbacks"" who acted as de facto quarterbacks are counted in the mix.6. 1934 Giants: Harry Newman had a short, modestly distinguished career as a 179-pound A-formation tailback (by today's standards, a Tebow). He led the league in nearly every passing category in 1933, but in 1934 he threw just one touchdown and 12 interceptions, statistics that were almost as bad then as they are today. Ken Strong was an All-Pro fullback/defensive back for both the Giants and the Staten Island Stapletons, then an N.F.L. team, and Strong rushed for 431 yards and 6 touchdowns. His best years were behind him by 1934, though he stayed with the Giants as a placekicker until after World War II. The third member of the backfield was Wee Willie Smith, who played just one season in the N.F.L. (He is not to be confused with the legendary basketball player of the same name.) You do not have to be an expert in 1930s football to realize that a backfield with one player who played just one season and another who played just three seasons belongs low on any all-time list."

A new study shows that differences in blood pressure readings between a patient's right and left arm could be a sign of vascular disease and a greater risk of dying from heart disease.

This revelation was disclosed Monday by their center, Dan Connolly, who concluded that it will take ''work and effort'' to shield Brady from a pass rush from the team that pummeled him four years ago in Super Bowl XLII but, in what must be a relief to New England fans everywhere, ''yes, I think we can do it.''

Coluche, a well-known comedian, called for ''the lazy, the filthy, the drug addicts, the alcoholics, the pedophiles'' and other nonmainstream voters to elect him in 1981. Appealingly eccentric as they were, only Mr. Barbu obtained the endorsement he needed to be able to become an electable presidential candidate in France's odd political system, which requires 500 mayors or local officials to sign their names in support of a candidate before he or she can be put on the ballot."

As a result, these experts say, our ''built environment'' - where we live, work, play and shop - has become a leading cause of disability and death in the 21st century. Physical activity has been disappearing from the lives of young and old, and many communities are virtual ''food deserts,'' serviced only by convenience stores that stock nutrient-poor prepared foods and drinks."

Of course, if that's too steep, you could book the same room the following weekend -- for $55 a night. That would put you in town to see the Indiana Ice hockey team take on the Muskegon Lumberjacks on Feb. 11 at the Pepsi Coliseum. Supply and demand drive all aspects of travel, naturally. In Indianapolis, a midsize air travel market with fewer than half the hotel rooms of Dallas, the host of the Super Bowl last year, game weekend demand exceeds supply for most travel services -- including hotels and coveted landing and takeoff slots for private jets, and even parking.

Rob Daniels, a City Ballet spokesman, said Ms. Somogyi would have surgery on Tuesday. The dancer appeared to hurt herself during a performance of Christopher Wheeldon's ''Polyphonia'' at the David H.

In 2008 a federal judge in Brooklyn ruled that her firing was fair because her employers were not obligated to accommodate her needs. We see this kind of case in our legal clinic all the time.

They have started a misguided campaign called Merit Matters to stop the judge and the city from creating new exams for potential applicants and have distributed materials to various stationhouses. Last month, the Fire Department, in what seems like a misguided response, tried to ban ''material presenting opinions or viewpoints'' anywhere in the city's firehouses. That broad language raised serious free speech issues. Stephen Cassidy, the president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, told his 8,000 members to ignore the order, which prompted department officials to rework their directive last week. It now allows only ''official department business or important information relating to approved departmental organizations'' to be posted in firehouses. Since Merit Matters is not an approved department organization, its bulletins would not be allowed. This revised order seems overly broad as well."

She had battled breast cancer for 12 years, but when treatments failed, she accepted death with dignity and grace. Her beloved cat Melody, Dagmar Henle-Dieckmann and niece Katharina Dieckmann, who had traveled from Europe, were at her bedside. In the last year, she shared precious time with her far-flung family, who flew in from Germany and France: nephews Jan and Kai; niece Katharina; niece-in-law Kirsten; grandnephews Clement; David, Max and Vincent; and grandnieces Lina, Nele and Sophie. Marianne was born in 1926 in Berlin to Frieda and Max Dieckmann, a physician. Her brother Hans, older by five years, a physician and psychoanalyst, died in 2005. As a child, Marianne devoured every novel German author Karl May ever wrote about the American Old West. As a teenager, she endured the hardships of World War II, which forced her to abandon dreams of becoming a physician. But she kept her dreams of Karl May's America and moved there seeking work in medical research, eventually joining Dr. Paul Berg's research group at Washington University in 1958, one year before the group moved to Stanford. As one of the founders of the Stanford Biochemistry Department, her commitment and organizational skills helped establish the department as a world leader in biomedical research. She did experiments that helped earn Professor Paul Berg the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Though never married, she was mother to many, showing newly arrived students and their families how to settle into life in Palo Alto. Forcefully, but lovingly, she taught them the ethos and discipline required of a responsible and thoughtful scientist. She knew how best to help students, reinforcing their confidence after mini-triumphs and providing solace in times of trouble. Those far from home during the holidays could count on German style Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners at her home. Marianne loved sharing her passions for music, reading, and bird watching, and delighted in hosting Kaffeeklatsch on her back patio for her many friends. She was proud of her American citizenship, and after retiring from laboratory work in 1998, she became a volunteer leader at the Stanford Bechtel International Center, co-chairing the English-in-Action program and teaching her adopted language to students and their spouses. To honor her contributions, the Community Committee for International Students (CCIS) established the ""Marianne Dieckmann Award"" as part of the Spouse Education Fund. Marianne Dieckmann's selfless and caring personality earned her the love and devotion from all who knew her. As one of her final wishes, Marianne requested that in lieu of flowers, friends and family should donate to their own favorite charities. She will always be in our hearts and minds. A Memorial Service will be held for her in early March."

(HBO2) THE BANGER SISTERS (2002) Susan Sarandon plays Lavinia, a conservative Phoenix housewife whose carefully camouflaged past as a '70s rock groupie threatens to resurface when her partner in backstage adventure, Suzette (Goldie Hawn), unexpectedly shows up for a visit, and a handout. Geoffrey Rush plays a failed screenwriter who is in town to kill his father. He hasn't had sex in a decade, but Suzette will take care of that. ''For all the charm effused by its stars, 'The Banger Sisters,' written and directed by Bob Dolman, emerges as a pallid, unconvincing pipe dream,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times."

Third-ranked UConn had already lost on the road to those teams this season and needed to gain a quality road win to make a statement about its place in the hierarchy.

They've turned into mud-wrestling contests, he said on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, and are driving up negative impressions of the party's presidential candidates. Mr. McCain, who knows something about unfavorable ratings, is right that the 19 debates so far have left an increasingly sour taste in voters' mouths. Since the debates began, the popularity gap has grown between the leading Republican candidates and President Obama."
2012-01-31T00:00:00Z,"Lawmakers dissatisfied with the performance of the Transportation Security Administration are pushing to revive a proposal the agency has resisted -- allowing airports to use screeners hired by private contractors -- so the agency can focus more on its role as overseer, rather than operator, of airport security. Just 16 of the 450 or so commercial airports in the United States use private security companies, which are vetted and supervised by the T.S.A. according to rules Congress outlined when it established the agency. But in recent years, the security agency has rejected requests by additional airports to join the private screening program -- a decision some members of Congress and airport officials would like to change."

Rod was a past president and the longest standing member of the Club. In 2011, the Westminster members awarded him its prestigious Sensation Award, named for the club's symbolic Pointer and given in recognition of a member's contribution to the club, to purebred dogs, and to the sport of showing dogs. Rod was a Westminster member since 1959 and served as president from 1969-1972. He served as vice president four times, as vice chair of the show committee, and as chief ring steward for many years. He was also a trustee of Westminster Kennel Foundation, which he helped to create. Mr. Lindsay and his wife Nancy were quite active in the dog show world, breeding and showing Basset Hounds and Bloodhounds out of their Lime Tree Kennels in Syosset, NY, for many years. He was past president and longtime AKC Delegate for the American Bloodhound Club, past president of the Long Island Kennel Club, and past treasurer of the ASPCA. Avid collectors of dog art and memorabilia, the Lindsays were involved with the founding of the AKC Museum of the Dog in 1981. Mrs. Lindsay, who passed away in 2008, was a longtime trustee of WKF. A graduate of Yale University, Rod Lindsay was in the banking business for 40 years and retired as president of JP Morgan. His brother, the late John Lindsay, was a past Mayor of New York City."

True, Ms. Garofalo's Diana occasionally mangles her English in amusing ways that are made even funnier by the rough, gruff edges of Ms. Garofalo's voice. And Diana's stern browbeating of her children also includes the occasional foray into sitcom-ready insults. When she insists her 14-year-old daughter start wearing a bra, Diana snaps, ''You look like a gorilla, swinging from tree to tree.''"

Performed at the PIT in Manhattan, it's a solid one-joke skit until the cheerfully awful joke teller (Billy Scafuri) makes a sincere and surprisingly persuasive case for his puns. This detour from mocking to justifying dad humor is short, but filling in this caricature with a sympathetic motivation introduces an unusual twist in sketch comedy: heart."

2012-01-31T00:00:00Z,"During the depths of the recession in 2009, leaders of Signature Theater Company had a showy selling point in their pitch to raise $38.5 million to build a new home: models of the 70,000-square-foot complex by a star architect, Frank Gehry. Yet Signature, a respected but frills-free Off Broadway nonprofit, lacked a grand space in which to show the models and to entertain prospective donors. James Houghton, who created Signature in 1991 and remains artistic director, found a solution, thanks to an actor whose career he helped start: Edward Norton, the Oscar-nominated actor (''American History X'') and a Signature board member since 1996. Mr. Norton offered an empty corner in his expanded downtown apartment, and soon he and Mr. Houghton were holding cocktail parties and private viewings."

2012-01-31T00:00:00Z,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- In the past two years the young British choreographer Liam Scarlett has achieved the status of an important classical-ballet choreographer. The images, constructions and textures of ''Viscera,'' his new creation for Miami City Ballet, show why. I watched it with three different casts over the weekend at the Kravis Center for the Performing Arts here. Each time the audience proclaimed its excitement the moment it ended. That's a natural response to the terrific control of physical energy in its elaborate finale; but in terms of architectural organization too, this is an impressive piece. For Edward Villella, the founding artistic director of the Miami company and now in his penultimate season there, it's quite a coup to be the first American company to have commissioned a ballet by Mr. Scarlett. ''Viscera'' is choreographed to Lowell Liebermann's 1983 Piano Concerto No. 1; Mr. Villella has programmed it as the first of a triple bill featuring piano. And when the evening's other two ballets, established classics, followed -- Jerome Robbins's ''In the Night'' (to Chopin nocturnes) and George Balanchine's ''Ballet Imperial'' (to Tchaikovsky's Second Piano Concerto), both excellently performed -- Mr. Scarlett's authority and imagination remained in memory."

In November 2009, a United States District Court in Birmingham ruled largely in his favor and against the university.

2012-02-01T15:32:31Z,"Opera pumps, evening slippers, court shoes - all are fairly off-putting, emasculating names for the footwear that made its way down many runways during the recent men's shows in Europe. A more user-friendly term might be evening slip-ons. Those prim, shiny black-patent shoes, traditionally finished with grosgrain ribbon and worn to the opera and other after-five affairs, have been transformed into red-carpet walkers ornately decorated with embroidery, tassels, metal studs, glitter and prints. Dries van Noten chose sleek brown pony and black astrakhan for his version. Almost every single pair of shoes that walked down the Etro runway was a slip-on that was either jacquarded, paisleyed, embroidered or feathered. Jimmy Choo's hyper elegant and wildly expanding men's line has so many varieties of their evening shoe, the Sloane, that is seems almost a wardrobe staple - leopard prints, studded stars and a house-designed ""porno camo"" are just some of what's offered. Sarah Burton's rich, dandified Alexander McQueen collection, with its Prince of Wales plaids, trompe l'oeil moiré and knickered suits, had an elegant evening outfit in black and white with a shoe embroidered with such large white roses they looked life-sized. Tom Ford, ever the night bird, has shown elegant evening shoes in his line from the get go: rich velvets ready for a monogram and extravagant brocades, some with slinky tassels. Perfect for a handsome Beverly Hills house husband. And Christian Louboutin, who presented his growing men's line in Paris, added some more slip-ons in velvet with studded cap toes and a properly regal crest. Given the recent stateside popularity of the espadrille, and similar styles by Toms Shoes, the evening slip-on has big potential for a life outside the opera house. Say, with a pair of worn in, rolled-up jeans and a simple white shirt? I'm in."

Filings to the Federal Election Commission offered the first detailed look at a crucial source of support for Mr. Romney and showed his ability to win substantial backing from a small number of his party's most influential and wealthy patrons, each contributing to the super PAC far more than the $2,500 each could donate to his campaign. Fund-raising documents filed by President Obama showed the kind of financial juggernaut Mr. Romney will face if he becomes his party's nominee: Mr. Obama reported raising a total of $140 million in 2011, far eclipsing the $57 million Mr. Romney raised for the year. The figures underscored the deep divide between how each party's presidential contenders are financing their early bids for the White House: Mr. Obama exploiting the well-oiled machinery of an incumbent with a powerful grass-roots apparatus and hundreds of ""bundlers"" gathering checks of up to $2,500 per person from friends and associates, and his Republican opponents relying far more heavily on independent groups empowered by court decisions that have made it easier for wealthy individuals and corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money to intervene directly in election contests.

2012-02-01T00:00:00Z,"1:35 P.M. (Sundance) ENCOUNTERS AT THE END OF THE WORLD (2008) For this documentary Werner Herzog traveled to Antarctica, where he met scientists and journeymen (above, a diver under the ice) at the American outpost McMurdo Station and the penguins, seals, clams and jellyfish that surround them on what might as well be another planet. ''Few filmmakers make the end of days seem as hauntingly beautiful as Werner Herzog does, or as inexorable,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. One of the film's beauties, Ms. Dargis said, ''is that all the furry and floating animals are no more wondrous than the bipeds tramping through and around McMurdo: the linguist turned philosopher, the banker turned bus driver and the female adventurer who, for drama and odd entertainment, likes to have herself zipped up in a carryall bag. (She's her own baggage.) Mr. Herzog opens his mind, heart and eyes to all these wayfarers who -- despite the persistent strain of melancholy that touches each and every person who appears on camera -- seem eerily at peace at the bottom of the world.'' The film received an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature. 9 A.M. (Sundance) LE DIVORCE (2003) Kate Hudson plays Isabel Walker, an American in Paris to visit her pregnant half-sister (Naomi Watts), whose marriage to a French artist (Melvil Poupaud) is in shambles. And after a style and sensibility makeover, lust and romance ensue. Writing in The Times about this Merchant-Ivory adaptation of Diane Johnson's novel, A. O. Scott said that despite very fine actors -- among them Stephen Fry, Sam Waterston, Stockard Channing, Glenn Close (above right, with Ms. Hudson), Leslie Caron and Thierry Lhermitte -- the film ''is pretty weak tea, a thin and unsatisfying concoction that somehow manages to make one of the richest and most durable sources of culture-clash comedy into an occasion for dullness.''

Aase was born January 17, 1921 in Oslo Norway. Her father died when she was seven, leaving her mother and five children without a livelihood, but her mother managed to keep her home and raise her children through the Depression. In 1941 Aase graduated from Oslo Handels Gymnasium (Business School). She had dreamed of being a fashion designer, but with the Germans now occupying Norway, she went to work for the Norwegian Government-in-exile, serving in the Resistance. She assisted in her Austrian-Jewish brother-in-law's escape from Norway and thereafter, posing as a young mother, she took Norwegian-Jewish children to safety over the border into neutral Sweden. While working for the Resistance in Trondheim in 1943, she was awoken in the middle of the night by the Germans and imprisoned in a concentration camp in Norway, where she spent the next 18 months of her life. Released in 1944 to be followed, she escaped into Sweden and worked for the Norwegian Embassy in Stockholm. She was transferred in 1945 to England, celebrating VE-Day with the British, and then onto the Norwegian Embassy in New York. Aase was offered a job in the newly formed United Nations, which was then laying plans to move to New York, (the first Secretary-General was Norwegian) but opted instead for family and homemaking, marrying in 1947 and moving to Larchmont, NY. Her beloved husband Warren B. Holby was a founding partner of Merritt & Holby - a firm building post-war housing developments in Westchester County, later developing office parks and Rye Ridge Shopping Center - the first Shopping Center in the eastern United States. While raising her family in Larchmont, Aase was active in many local organizations, including Planned Parenthood of Westchester, Larchmont Women's and The Newcomer's Clubs, was a Trustee of Larchmont Avenue Church and Chairman of Larchmont Assembly. Aase and Warren also enjoyed their home in Ludlow, VT, where she was a devoted volunteer for Skiing with the Blind. Aase was active in all things Norwegian. She served as Chair of the American-Scandinavian Society-Social Comm, a director of Scandinavian Seminar and an active contributor at the Norwegian Seamen's Church. Aase and Warren traveled to Norway annually in their later years, both to Oslo and the mountain log-home. Warren passed away in 2002. Aase is survived by her four children: Grethe Holby Elgort of New York, Kristin C. Holby Darnell of Larchmont, NY, W. Barrett Holby Jr. of Warren, RI and Wegard D. Holby of Upper Black Eddy, PA; and eleven grandchildren: Sophie, Warren and Ansel Elgort; Duncan, Phoebe and Camilla White; Robin and Will Holby; and Sara, Kate and Jack Holby. On January 17th Aase celebrated her 91st birthday with her family. May she rest in peace after her eventful, adventurous, extraordinarily happy life, full of love.

Janet Pierson, producer of the festival's movie portion, noted ''a kind of aggressiveness, a boldness, risk-taking'' in 130 feature films that will screen between March 9 and March 17 in Austin, Tex. Ms. Pierson pointed, for example, to ''Dollhouse,'' an Irish film, from the writer-director Kirsten Sheridan, about five street kids who create havoc after breaking into a suburban Dublin home. Several documentaries in the program look at Los Angeles and the raucous past of its music culture. Those include ''Sunset Strip,'' about the history of that iconic portion of Sunset Boulevard, and ''Uprising: Hip Hop & the L.A. Riots.'' Celebrity figures in ''$ellebrity,'' a documentary by the star photographer Kevin Mazur, and in ''Decoding Deepak,'' also a documentary, in which Gotham Chopra examines his famous father, Deepak. The festival earlier announced that it would host the premiere of ''The Cabin in the Woods,'' a long-awaited horror film directed by Drew Goddard and written by Mr. Goddard and Joss Whedon. In all, programmers reviewed 1,957 feature-length submissions, including 1,387 from the United States, and 570 from abroad, the festival said. The full feature film program is listed here. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2012-02-02T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (HBO) THE UNION (2011) When Elton John and Leon Russell met in 1970, Mr. John was on the verge of stardom with a self-titled album and a Top 10 hit, ''Your Song.'' Mr. Russell, who had played with Phil Spector and the Rolling Stones and written standards like ''A Song for You,'' was already rock 'n' roll royalty. Nearly four decades later Mr. John (above left, with Mr. Russell) was listening to Mr. Russell's greatest-hits album when he broke down in tears. Despite not having seen or spoken to Mr. Russell in more than 35 years, he was determined to reconnect with, and bring renewed attention to, this man who had been a strong musical influence. The result was ''The Union,'' their 2010 album of country-tinged collaborations like the Grammy-nominated ''If It Wasn't for Bad,'' whose creation was captured by the director Cameron Crowe. Shot during recording sessions at Village Studios in Los Angeles, the documentary, which opened the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival, weaves in concert footage of the men throughout their careers. 2:30 P.M. (Showtime) LARS AND THE REAL GIRL (2007) Lars, a sensitive loner (Ryan Gosling, below), forms an emotional bond with Bianca, a life-size sex doll, and soon she's attending school board meetings and being invited to dinner by well-meaning townsfolk. Paul Schneider and Emily Mortimer play Lars's incredulous brother and sister-in-law, who suggest that he and Bianca attend counseling. Kelli Garner is Margo, the real woman who catches Lars's eye -- though he would never cheat on Bianca. Mr. Gosling received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor; Nancy Oliver got an Oscar nomination for her screenplay. ''It's part comedy, part tragedy and 100 percent pure calculation, designed to wring fat tears and coax big laughs and leave us drying our damp, smiling faces as we savor the touching vision of American magnanimity,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times."

Mr. Taylor, an architect who opposes the planned tower, is a co-chairman of the board's parks, waterfront and recreation committee; he is not president of its landmarks committee.

It's been a long time since I studied statistics and probability (and maybe I never did, depending on how you define ""study""), but it seems to me that this betting line is saying a few things. First, it'll be a close game. Second, one of the two teams is likely to have kicked a field goal at some point to get its final lead. Or third, if one team is trailing toward the end of the fourth quarter, it might well get a chance to kick a field goal to tie or win the game. Lastly, and this, really, is the red zone I'm driving toward: Everything will probably just come down to, in Peyton Manning's memorable words, an ""idiot kicker."""

But these subcompact dwellings, like the Nakagin Capsule Tower, built in Tokyo in 1971 by Kisho Kurokawa, are more than just design oddities: they are manifestations of utopian urban planning theories hatched a decade earlier, when a generation of Japanese architects sought to brand their ultramodern solutions to problems such as overpopulation and the limitations of the aquatic frontier. After discarding several Japanese concepts that translated along the lines of ""replacing old with new,"" ""eternal return"" or ""constant change,"" they settled on an international term (well, an English one) and called their practice ""Metabolism."""

(Nickelodeon) MIKE THE KNIGHT This new computer-animated series invites preschoolers into an enchanted medieval world of castles, dragons and trolls while teaching about friendship, loyalty and determination as they follow the adventures of Mike, a knight in training, above left. His motto is ''Be a knight, do it right,'' which he accomplishes with the help of his trusty steed, Galahad, and the friendly dragons Squirt and Sparkie. The series, which will be broadcast weekdays at noon starting Monday, was created by Alexander Bar (''Lunar Jim'') and written by Marc Seal (''Bob the Builder''). 2:25 P.M. (Sundance) PARIS (2008) Romain Duris plays Pierre, a dancer at the Moulin Rouge who is awaiting a heart transplant that could save his life. Juliette Binoche is Élise, his older, divorced sister, a social worker who moves into his apartment with her three children to care for him -- and in the process opens his eyes to the city's possibilities. A subplot follows the romantic misadventures of a history professor (Fabrice Luchini) who becomes so besotted with a beautiful student (Mélanie Laurent) that he sends her anonymous text messages, some in cyberspeak -- ''U R awesome. I'm 2 hot 4 U.'' -- and others quoting the love poetry of Baudelaire. ''In 'Paris,' Cédric Klapisch's sumptuous Gallic comedy, the camera, whether surveying the landmarks from on high or peering out of an apartment window at the passing parade, becomes a surrogate for a first-time visitor to the City of Light,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''Both a Parisian answer to Woody Allen's 'Manhattan' and a multicharacter mosaic in the mode of Robert Altman's 'Short Cuts,' the movie sprawls invitingly across the screen like a glowing Impressionist painting.''"

2012-02-03T00:00:00Z,"HOLBY--Aase-Grethe, passed away peacefully in her daughter's home in New York on Thursday morning January. 26th of natural causes. She was 91 years old. Aase was born January 17, 1921 in Oslo Norway. Her father died when she was seven, leaving her mother and five children without a livelihood, but her mother managed to keep her home and raise her children through the Depression. In 1941 Aase graduated from Oslo Handels Gymnasium (Business School). She had dreamed of being a fashion designer, but with the Germans now occupying Norway, she went to work for the Norwegian Government-in-exile, serving in the Resistance. She assisted in her Austrian-Jewish brother-in-law's escape from Norway and thereafter, posing as a young mother, she took Norwegian-Jewish children to safety over the border into neutral Sweden. While working for the Resistance in Trondheim in 1943, she was awoken in the middle of the night by the Germans and imprisoned in a concentration camp in Norway, where she spent the next 18 months of her life. Released in 1944 to be followed, she escaped into Sweden and worked for the Norwegian Embassy in Stockholm. She was transferred in 1945 to England, celebrating VE-Day with the British, and then onto the Norwegian Embassy in New York. Aase was offered a job in the newly formed United Nations, which was then laying plans to move to New York, (the first Secretary-General was Norwegian) but opted instead for family and homemaking, marrying in 1947 and moving to Larchmont, NY. Her beloved husband Warren B. Holby was a founding partner of Merritt & Holby - a firm building post-war housing developments in Westchester County, later developing office parks and Rye Ridge Shopping Center - the first Shopping Center in the eastern United States. While raising her family in Larchmont, Aase was active in many local organizations, including Planned Parenthood of Westchester, Larchmont Women's and The Newcomer's Clubs, was a Trustee of Larchmont Avenue Church and Chairman of Larchmont Assembly. Aase and Warren also enjoyed their home in Ludlow, VT, where she was a devoted volunteer for Skiing with the Blind. Aase was active in all things Norwegian. She served as Chair of the American-Scandinavian Society-Social Comm, a director of Scandinavian Seminar and an active contributor at the Norwegian Seamen's Church. Aase and Warren traveled to Norway annually in their later years, both to Oslo and the mountain log-home. Warren passed away in 2002. Aase is survived by her four children: Grethe Holby Elgort of New York, Kristin C. Holby Darnell of Larchmont, NY, W. Barrett Holby Jr. of Warren, RI and Wegard D. Holby of Upper Black Eddy, PA; and eleven grandchildren: Sophie, Warren and Ansel Elgort; Duncan, Phoebe and Camilla White; Robin and Will Holby; and Sara, Kate and Jack Holby. On January 17th Aase celebrated her 91st birthday with her family. May she rest in peace after her eventful, adventurous, extraordinarily happy life, full of love. Funeral Services will be held Saturday, February 4th at 1:30pm at Frank Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Ave, New York. Memorial gifts may be sent to New Life, 66 Clinton St. 2nd Flr., New York, NY 10002; or The Children's Village-Development, 1 Echo Hills, Dobbs Ferry, NY 10522."

2012-02-03T00:00:00Z,"HAWES, Rosilla Hornblower. Died on January 27, 2012 at the age of 100. Most beloved mother of Lynden B. Miller, cherished mother-in-law of Leigh M. Miller and adored grandmother of Gifford, Marshall, Ethan, and Christian Miller, their wives and eight great-grandchildren whose lives she enriched with her kind, loving and generous nature and her wide-ranging knowledge of literature, public affairs and history. She was born in New York City in 1911 and attended the Chapin School and Vassar College, class of 1933. She was married in 1935 to Alan R. Breed who died in 1954. In 1979 she married Alexander B. Hawes who died in 1995. She lived in Washington, D.C. for many years before returning to her native New York almost a decade ago. Her New York roots went way back in New York history. Her ancestors ranged from Susannah Rutgers Marshall, a businesswoman in 18th century New Amsterdam, the Architect, Henry Rutgers Marshall, to Judge William B. Hornblower of the New York Court of Appeals, as well as many other New York architects and lawyers. Her family for many generations believed passionately in public service, and dinner conversation when she was growing up always centered on current events and politics. After Vassar, where she majored in sociology and economics, she worked at the National Consumers League, an organization dedicated to helping women in the workplace founded by Frances Perkins. From long family tradition, she was always a passionate Democrat and, as she put it, ""a New Yorker to the bone,"" so she delighted in the public careers of her two grandsons, Gifford Miller, former Speaker of the New York City Council, and Marshall Miller, Chief of the Criminal Division at the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. Though not a gardener herself, she was proud of her daughter, Lynden B. Miller, Public Garden Designer, in her role of beautifying the city they both loved. For those lucky enough to know her, she personified a LADY: elegant, gracious, thoughtful, tactful and sympathetic to everyone she met. She spent her life cherishing the many people she loved and supporting New York City causes and institutions like The New York Botanical Garden, The New York Public Library and The Community Service Society. Contributions in her memory could be made to any of those organizations."

An actress and philanthropist, Ms. Fine pursued many passions with generosity, courage and heart. While raising three children, she both served as volunteer Chairman of Combined Jewish Philanthropies and Israel Bonds for Boston, and taught school. Years of involvement in politics culminated in her service as a senior aide to Boston Mayor Kevin White. After her successful coordination of the National Conference of Mayors, Mayor White appointed her the Chairman of the George Robert White Fund, a public charitable trust of the City of Boston. At age 50, Norma decided to return to her initial love of acting, becoming a successful actress on Boston and regional stages, starring in countless commercials, and making her cinematic debut as Mrs. Goodhall in the film, Cider House Rules. Ms. Fine cared deeply about helping children in need. She endowed a Pediatric Fellowship at the Mass General Hospital, as well as supporting a number of Israeli charities that help children, including Yemin Orde, a youth village in Israel where her daughter, Lauri, worked. The most important children in her life were her eight extraordinary grandchildren, whose triumphs and growing pains she worried over and helped to guide every day. She was predeceased by her husband, Phil David Fine, and her sister Sandra Loew. She is survived by her partner of 19 years, Herb Feinstein, her sister Harriet Jacobson, her daughters, Susan Fine, Lauri Fine Friedman and Debra Fine, and her eight grandchildren, Eyal, Sivan and Daphna Friedman, Allison and Pamela Fine Mishkin and Jordan, Abigail and Phil Fine Schneider.

In a television interview Thursday night, Goodell said that if the league were to expand, it would do so by adding two teams rather than just one. Several teams -- including the St. Louis Rams and the Minnesota Vikings -- are dealing with stadium issues, and they are considered candidates to move to Los Angeles, in addition to, among others, the Oakland Raiders and the San Diego Chargers, both of whom also need new stadiums.

Mr. Rudin, the Tony Award-winning producer of Broadway hits like ''The Book of Mormon,'' said on Wednesday that he would no longer be a part of ''Clybourne Park'' because Mr. Norris, who is also an actor, withdrew this week from a role in a television pilot that Mr. Rudin is producing for HBO, an adaptation of Jonathan Franzen's novel ''The Corrections.''"

Malcolm and Miriam were raised in Rockaway Beach, Queens, and lived in Valley Stream and Greenwich Village. Malcolm was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He served four years as a U.S. Navy officer in the central and south Pacific during World War II, retiring as a Commander in the U.S. Navy reserve. He was a leader of New York's printing industry, founder of Weaver Organization and president of such groups as the Navigators and the Lithographers Guild. He served on the Board of Trustees of the New School for Social Research. Miriam was active as a fundraiser for the New School and other charities, from the March of Dimes in the 1950s to the Lighthouse and Sight Loss Center of Central Pennsylvania. She was the life of every party. The Kleins were the beloved parents of Joe and Ken Klein, loving grandparents of Christopher, Terry, Sophie and Theodore, great-grandparents of Zoe and Beatrice.

(A quick refresher: an annual calendar on an automatic watch usually needs adjusting once a year, at the end of February; a perpetual calendar accounts for February's odd 29th day and needs only a manual nudge every 100 years or so.)

He died as he lived, with courage and humility, drawing upon an inner strength that never failed to inspire and amaze. Len was born and raised in New York City where his education included The BronxHigh School of Science, Queens College, Columbia University, and most importantly, the incredible libraries, museums, theatre, opera, and melting pot of New York City. The child of immigrants, Jenny and Zol, and brother to Emile, he inhaled the ideas and promises that America offered. Len later pursued his doctorate at the University of California, Davis, where he met Marilyn, who would become his wife and partner for the next 43 years. Len earned a BA, two master's degrees, and PhD, abd. He was a student of the world, studying art, languages, history, and most recently, ukulele. There was never a need for an encyclopedia for Len was the Encyclopedia Britannica; Google before there was Google. Len launched his career at the United Nations, and spent over ten years with the Peace Corps directing programs in India, Iran, Micronesia, and the Solomon Islands. Later he served as Executive Director of the International Institute of the East Bay, after a decade as Director of Human Resources for Icore, International in Silicon Valley. Len was a quiet force who offered books, ideas, and encouragement to any who crossed his path. He will be loved and remembered by his wife, his children and their families, his grandchildren, his brother-in-law, his nephew and nieces and their families, and by all he touched and nurtured.

Born into a family of anarchists and free thinkers in rural Nebraska and raised on a farm in western New York, Nelson devoted his life to challenging the status quo and expected to be in jail for it by the time he was thirty. Instead, he became a respected professor of Sociology at Cornell, Chicago and CUNY-Hunter. In 1940 he married Geraldine Roach, and they both spent the next few years working alternately for war agencies in Washington and the CIO in Detroit before returning to Ithaca. In 1951 he was named director of the Family Study Center at the University of Chicago, which published his best known book, Identity and Interpersonal Competence, describing what would later be termed ""emotional intelligence"". He left academia for General Electric in New York, where he worked on development projects, including the new city of Columbia, MD and initiatives in Trinidad-Tobago. Returning to teaching at Hunter in 1969, he began elucidating a theory of development based on universal professionalization and investment in human potential. His final work can be found at: www.sharingtheearth.net. In 1984 he and Geraldine moved to Mill Valley CA. Geraldine died in 2005.

And while there is no question that some kids continue to experiment with sex and substance abuse, the latest data points to something perhaps more surprising: the current generation is, well, a bit boring when it comes to bad behavior. By several noteworthy measures, today's teenagers are growing increasingly conservative. While marijuana use has recently had an uptick, teenagers are smoking far less pot than their parents did at the same age. In 1980, about 60 percent of high-school seniors had tried marijuana and 9 percent smoked it daily. Among seniors today, according to the University of Michigan's Monitoring the Future survey, which has tracked teenage risk behaviors since 1975, 45.5 percent have tried the drug and 6.6 percent are smoking it frequently ()."

2012-02-05T00:00:00Z,"HAWES, Rosilla Hornblower. Died on January 27, 2012 at the age of 100. Most beloved mother of Lynden B. Miller, cherished mother-in-law of Leigh M. Miller and adored grandmother of Gifford, Marshall, Ethan, and Christian Miller, their wives and eight great-grandchildren whose lives she enriched with her kind, loving and generous nature and her wide-ranging knowledge of literature, public affairs and history. She was born in New York City in 1911 and attended the Chapin School and Vassar College, class of 1933. She was married in 1935 to Alan R. Breed who died in 1954. In 1979 she married Alexander B. Hawes who died in 1995. She lived in Washington, D.C. for many years before returning to her native New York almost a decade ago. Her New York roots went way back in New York history. Her ancestors ranged from Susannah Rutgers Marshall, a businesswoman in 18th century New Amsterdam, the Architect, Henry Rutgers Marshall, to Judge William B. Hornblower of the New York Court of Appeals, as well as many other New York architects and lawyers. Her family for many generations believed passionately in public service, and dinner conversation when she was growing up always centered on current events and politics. After Vassar, where she majored in sociology and economics, she worked at the National Consumers League, an organization dedicated to helping women in the workplace founded by Frances Perkins. From long family tradition, she was always a passionate Democrat and, as she put it, ""a New Yorker to the bone,"" so she delighted in the public careers of her two grandsons, Gifford Miller, former Speaker of the New York City Council, and Marshall Miller, Chief of the Criminal Division at the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. Though not a gardener herself, she was proud of her daughter, Lynden B. Miller, Public Garden Designer, in her role of beautifying the city they both loved. For those lucky enough to know her, she personified a LADY: elegant, gracious, thoughtful, tactful and sympathetic to everyone she met. She spent her life cherishing the many people she loved and supporting New York City causes and institutions like The New York Botanical Garden, The New York Public Library and The Community Service Society. Contributions in her memory could be made to any of those organizations."

Neither of my internships violated the law -- one was at a nonprofit in a foreign country, and the other was with the federal government -- but had they been with for-profit entities in the United States, they might have. Assuming an unpaid internship is mutually beneficial and entered into freely by both parties, should such arrangements be illegal? And should scarce government resources be spent on trying to police the large and growing number of unpaid internships? I have my doubts."

While raising three children, she both served as volunteer Chairman of Combined Jewish Philanthropies and Israel Bonds for Boston, and taught school. Years of involvement in politics culminated in her service as a senior aide to Boston Mayor Kevin White. After her successful coordination of the National Conference of Mayors, Mayor White appointed her the Chairman of the George Robert White Fund, a public charitable trust of the City of Boston. At age 50, Norma decided to return to her initial love of acting, becoming a successful actress on Boston and regional stages, starring in countless commercials, and making her cinematic debut as Mrs. Goodhall in the film, Cider House Rules. Ms. Fine cared deeply about helping children in need. She endowed a Pediatric Fellowship at the Mass General Hospital, as well as supporting a number of Israeli charities that help children, including Yemin Orde, a youth village in Israel where her daughter, Lauri, worked.

2012-02-05T00:00:00Z,"COPELAND--Lawrence G. Lawrence G. Copeland, Noted Craftsman, Designer, Educator, and Former POW, Dies at 89. Lawrence G. Copeland, a well-known mid-twentieth-century American silversmith and long-time City College of New York educator, died on January 26 at his home in Boulder, Colorado. He was 89. As a student, craftsman, designer, and teacher, Mr. Copeland interacted with some of the most important personalities of the mid-century American crafts movement and contributed to several of the most prominent craft institutions and enterprises. Lawrence Gill Copeland was born in 1922 in Pittsburgh and raised in Knoxville. He attended Muskingum College before transferring to Ohio State University to pursue his love of art, despite objections from his parents. When World War II intervened in Mr. Copeland's undergraduate education, he served as lead navigator for the 459th Bombardment Group of the 15th Air Force and flew on B-24 ""Liberators"" before being shot down over Avignon, France in July 1944. He recorded his experience as a Prisoner-of-War at Stalag Luft I in sketches and other artwork in a Red Cross journal. He published that artwork with an accompanying narrative in 2010. Following his liberation, he graduated from Ohio State in 1946. Mr. Copeland earned a Swedish Royal Fellowship to the University of Stockholm for 1947 and 1948 and also studied with Baron Erik Fleming, Court Silversmith to His Majesty the King of Sweden, at Konstfackskolan while in Stockholm. He then studied painting with Emeric Gomery in Paris in 1948 and 1949. Mr. Copeland returned to the United States and earned his Master of Fine Arts degree from Cranbrook Academy of Art in 1951. He quickly found an outlet for his silverwork at New York's now-legendary America House and began his long association with organizations sponsored by leading art patron and philanthropist Aileen Osborn Webb. Frances Wright Caroe, daughter of Frank Lloyd Wright and arts administrator of America House, facilitated his 1951 appointment as an Instructor at the School for American Craftsmen (SAC) at Rochester Institute of Technology. At SAC, Mr. Copeland met his future wife, Mary Cuteri, who was an Instructor in dress design, whom he married in 1953. Mr Copeland became Head of Design for Oneida, Ltd. in 1959. Returning to teaching, Mr. Copeland was appointed a Professor at City College of New York in 1963. He served as Chairman of the Department of Art from 1968 to 1969 but resigned from the post following the 1969 riots and disruptions on campus to return to more active teaching. In 1985, Mr. Copeland retired to Warwick, New York where he designed and built a home before moving to Boulder, Colorado in 2007. Throughout his career, Mr. Copeland contributed to the American crafts movement as both a practitioner and thoughtful leader. His work in silver and pewter displayed dramatic sculptural volumes and delicate abstract details. It was displayed on the international stage as part of a traveling exhibition sponsored by the United States State Department in 1953. When the Museum of Contemporary Crafts (now the Museum of Arts & Design) was established in New York in 1956 by the American Craft Council and Mrs. Webb, he was selected to contribute work to the initial Craftsmanship in a Changing World exhibit. Mr. Copeland also had the distinction of having his work exhibited in the United States Pavilion at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, Belgium and has pieces in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution. In addition to his account of his World War II experience, Mr. Copeland authored Fabrication of Silver Hollow Ware which was published in 1959. During his career he was a frequent contributor to American Craft magazine (and its predecessor Craft Horizons), served on the Board of Directors of several professional organizations, including the American Craft Council, was a member of the Selection Committee for the Fulbright Program, and was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, London. Mr. Copeland is survived by his wife of 58 years, Mary; his sons, Jeffrey and Ian; his daughter, Mary Louise Copeland; their spouses; and seven grandchildren. Lawrence Copeland moved among notable people and places of the mid-twentieth century crafts movement. While his work is the most tangible testament to his contribution to that movement, his most lasting contribution may well be the thousands of today's craftspeople he taught or influenced as an educator and his support for the creation and early years of what has become New York's Museum of Arts & Design. The family has requested that donations in Mr. Copeland's honor be made to the Collings Foundation, PO Box 248, Stow, MA 01775. M. P. Murphy & Associates Funeral Directors of Boulder is handling arrangements."

2012-02-06T00:00:00Z,"LONDON -- Some plays are worth defying claustrophobia for. As a capacity audience crowded onto the benches that surrounded the rectangular stage of the tiny black-box space of the Royal Court Jerwood Theater Upstairs, I could feel my chest tightening and my breath growing shorter. It didn't help that layers of white balloons covered (and lowered) the ceiling in molecular formations. I had to admonish myself, as I do in such circumstances, ''Theater critics do not faint on the job - except, on rare occasion, metaphorically.'' And then Nick Payne's ''Constellations'' began, and the room - and my chest - expanded almost immediately. My chest stayed regulation size, but the room seemed to keep getting bigger during the 70 minutes of this two-character drama, which is acted with startling freshness by Sally Hawkins and Rafe Spall. This was altogether appropriate to a work about the limitlessness of physics and the enclosing limitations of human existence."

Fred was our colleague for 30 years, and he remained a friend to many of us after he joined the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2009. He was one of the architects of NERA's growth for many years, creating our Securities and Mass Torts Practices, providing groundbreaking economic analysis and testimony for clients, and mentoring many of those who went on to leadership positions in the firm. We will sorely miss his sharp intellect, his keen sense of humor, and his deep humanity. Our thoughts are with his friends and family, and especially his wife Helen Mangano.

2012-02-06T00:00:00Z,"Madonna earned praise early on for her halftime performance at the Super Bowl on Sunday night, but it was her guest star M.I.A. who may have stolen the headlines from her by making an obscene gesture during the show. M.I.A, the stage name of the hip-hop performer Maya Arulpragasam, appeared with the rapper Nicki Minaj to sing ''Give Me All Your Luvin','' a new Madonna song that was performed during a medley of the Material Girl's hits. At the end of her verse, M.I.A. stopped just short of singing a vulgar lyric and extended her middle finger to the camera. The television broadcast appeared to go blurry just after this, but not in time to obscure the gesture."

Born November 7, 1928, a graduate of Bronx High School of Science (1944), Columbia University (1947), and University of Wisconsin (PhD, 1952) where with Joshua Lederberg he discovered that viruses can carry genes between cells, a fundamental genetic process called transduction.

Rockefeller Jr. Professor of Genetics Emeritus and had served as Dean of Students for several years.

2012-02-06T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (Sundance) L'AMOUR FOU (2011) The French couturier Yves Saint Laurent, above right, may have been surrounded by intense beauty both in the atelier and at home, yet he was said to be joyful only twice a year: on the days a new collection was shown, usually to boisterous acclaim. Twenty-four hours later, the euphoria had evaporated. Pierre Bergé narrates this documentary about Saint Laurent, his partner in business and in life for a half-century until the designer's death in 2008. The ''crazy love'' of the title refers not so much to their relationship but to Saint Laurent's obsessions with objects, from the artworks -- including Picassos, Matisses, Braques and a treasured Brancusi that sold for $483.8 million at a 2009 Christie's auction -- to his passion for collecting perfect houses, one of which had all the rooms named after characters from Proust. ''Much of this stately, rather detached biography,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times of this documentary from Pierre Thoretton, ''is pornography for the eye (not the body).'' Of Saint Laurent's depression, he added, ''To realize that you may have the world while still feeling as if you have nothing is to experience a closer encounter with the void than most of us are likely to have.'' 6:30 P.M. (HBO2) NAMATH (2012) HBO Sports and NFL Films chronicle the life of Joe Namath, right, starting with his childhood in Beaver Falls, Pa., and his college days playing for Bear Bryant at the University of Alabama. The film extends to his larger-than-life stature on the field with the New York Jets and off, where his movie-star looks and free-wheeling personality earned him the nickname Broadway Joe. Then there was his famous guarantee of a Jets win in Super Bowl III against the heavily favored Baltimore Colts. Namath was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985. Family members, the former Baltimore Colts coach Don Shula and the actress Ann-Margret weigh in."

It showed his computer, which seemed to be open to Facebook, a bottle of Gatorade and a large sign that said ''stay focused and keep shipping,'' an apparent echo of the famous saying of the late Steve Jobs, ''real artists ship.'' The message: Mr. Zuckerberg was not going to let all his billions go to his head. By the end of the night, nearly a hundred people had posted comments. Most were innocuous. But, in what might be a straw in the wind, some of the most popular posts took issue with that sudden wealth, which derives directly from the site's ability to make money from the personal information of its hundreds of millions of users. Let's ignore the man who wrote ''Facebook is fascism incarnate,'' however much his analysis was liked. The same goes for the fellow who wrote ''Mark $uckerberg.''

''Chronicle,'' about three teenage boys who learn they have superpowers, was No. 1 at North American theaters, taking in about $22 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. The solid result for ''Chronicle,'' made in-house for a mere $12 million (not easy for a huge studio to do), validates Fox's decision to aggressively aim for elusive male moviegoers -- and on Super Bowl weekend, no less. Notably, Fox relied heavily on Twitter to create buzz, buying zero newspaper ads."

2012-02-07T15:36:38Z,"There's a new knitwear label in town called Orley that's as exciting and fresh-looking as any we've seen in some time. The label is led by the brothers Matthew and Alex Orley and their longtime friend (and Matthew's girlfriend) Samantha Florence, and their debut collection, available next fall, features seven sweater styles and a couple of scarves and hats in extremely optimistic colors and ""prints."" (Technically, they're double-faced wool and cashmere-blend jacquards on polos, cardigans, hoodies and crew-necks.) The brothers, both of whom have design experience - Matthew worked at Thom Browne; Alex at Rag & Bone, first in knits, then in denim - call music their main muse. ""There is no 'theme' to the collection, but we were listening to a lot of early psychedelic music - the Velvet Underground and the Zombies, which I think comes through,"" says Alex. That said, 20th-century art and Algonquin Provincial Park, a vast Canadian nature preserve where the three designers spent their summers, also played a part in Orley's optical-organic aesthetic. With more than a trick or two up their twisted cable and contrast-cuffed sleeves, the Orleys and Florence hope to fill a gap in the market for fashion-driven men's sweaters that are at once directional and high-end (prices range from $425 to $865). ""There was just a point where we thought: we're young, we know what we want to do, why wait?"" Florence says. Sadly, shoppers must do just that until August, when the collection becomes available at Fivestory in New York and at Union in Los Angeles. Worth it? No doubt."

""In classical roles you don't have the freedom to express deep inner emotions the way I do now,"" says the 35-year-old, conceding that she could never have taken on the part as a young girl. ""Even in Ariadne's weakness, the role of the maid, she is still strong and powerful.""

An upstart investor who has become known for knock-down, drag-out proxy fights, Mr. Biglari, 34, lost an election to the board of Cracker Barrel, the restaurant chain based in Tennessee.

2012-02-07T00:00:00Z,"A group of Latin jazz musicians are planning to hold a concert in Los Angeles on the same night as the Grammy Awards to protest the decision that eliminated 31 categories from this year's awards, protest organizers announced Monday. The concert will follow an afternoon rally on Sunday to be held on a street corner outside the Staples Center, where pop music's royalty will be assembled for the flashy annual Grammys bash. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the organization that controls the Grammy Awards, made a decision last year to consolidate more than a dozen categories and to eliminate other categories without consulting its rank and file members. Last April the academy slashed the categories from 109 to 78, eliminating separate trophies for male and female performers and getting rid of individual awards for genres like Latin jazz, Hawaiian music, zydeco, traditional blues and American Indian music. The cutbacks infuriated musicians from many of those genres that no longer have individual awards, especially Latin jazz artists. A few of those stars will appear at what they are calling the ''Not Those Awards All-Star Latin Jazz Jam'' on Sunday that will be held at the Mama Juana's nightclub. Ray Carrion and his Latin Jazz All Stars will head the bill, along with John Santos, Bobby Matos and Oscar Hernandez."

2012-02-07T00:00:00Z,"6:10 P.M. (TMC) BOTTLE SHOCK (2008) A British wine dealer (Alan Rickman) trying to break into the French oenological establishment heads to the Napa Valley of California in the 1970s in pursuit of American vintages that can stand up to their more established rivals in a blind tasting. Bill Pullman, above with Rachael Taylor, is the San Francisco lawyer turned struggling vintner, fond of quoting Hemingway and intent on turning his bourgeois life into a Steinbeck novel, who just might have the stuff to do it. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called this film from Randall Miller, based on a true story, ''an easygoing little movie, made with more affection than skill.'' Still, he added, '' 'Bottle Shock' is unable to figure out what kind of movie it wants to be, and flops around between madcap comedy and rousing drama. To borrow a wine-snob term of art, it lacks structure. Or, to push the idiom a little further, it's a little too sweet, with some pleasantly nutty notes and a baloney finish.'' 4:30 P.M. (HBO2) LOST IN TRANSLATION (2003) An American movie star (Bill Murray) cashing in on his celebrity to make an ad in Japan meets a young woman (Scarlett Johansson) who has been deserted by her husband (Giovanni Ribisi) in this comic melodrama written and directed by Sofia Coppola. As they escape the confines of the Tokyo Hyatt, something like love ensues. Mr. Murray ''supplies the kind of performance that seems so fully realized and effortless that it can easily be mistaken for not acting at all,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The Times. ''The corollary of this is that Ms. Coppola's direction is so breezily assured in its awareness of loneliness that the film could potentially be dismissed as self-consciously moody rather than registering as a mood piece. But it's bound to be recognized as a movie worthy of the kind of Oscar attention occasionally given to films that challenge audiences subtly.'' Mr. Murray received a best actor nomination; Ms. Coppola won for best original screenplay."

The design shows Eisenhower as a youth gazing out at images of his adult accomplishments against a backdrop of the Kansas plains. But the Eisenhower family objects to the design and is attempting to delay approval of the project in a dispute that has pitted a leading American family against one of the country's most recognized architects. The family says Mr. Gehry should portray Eisenhower as a man in the fullness of his achievements, not as a callow rustic who made good."

2012-02-08T09:25:56Z,"In a way, Rick Santorum's surprising Missouri-Minnesota-Colorado sweep last night is a lot like Newt Gingrich's win in South Carolina: A victory that reminds us all, once again, that Mitt Romney is a strikingly weak frontrunner, without changing the fact that Romney has a clear path to the nomination and his rivals really don't. The difference, though, is that Santorum is a stronger anti-Romney candidate than the combustible and compromised Gingrich, with wider geographic appeal (as he demonstrated last night) and fewer glaring liabilities. So whereas Romney was able to dispose of Gingrich pretty easily during the brief window where the race seemed to be down to a two-man race between them, if he gets into a two-man race with Santorum he's probably facing a much longer and more grueling contest."

2012-02-08T09:00:38Z,"For such a little building, the Lieb House has a notorious history. Designed by the Philadelphia architecture firm of Venturi & Rauch (now Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates) for Nathaniel and Judith Lieb and completed in 1969 in Barnegat Light, N.J., the house - a two-toned, asbestos-shingled box with a giant, Pop Art-influenced number 9 on the front and a huge crescent window on one side - caused outrage even in a neighborhood where clotheslines and telephone poles were essential parts of the landscape. Its living room and kitchen were on the second floor, to take advantage of the views, and its four small bedrooms were tucked into the first floor, where a washer and dryer greeted visitors, glorifying the daily chore of laundering bathing suits and beach towels. Robert Venturi referred to the house as a ""banal box,"" but then he considered this a compliment. Venturi and his associates, including his wife and business partner, the urban planner Denise Scott Brown, have made a career out of celebrating the ordinary, in numerous buildings as well as in the books ""Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture"" and ""Learning From Las Vegas."" Scott Brown said of the house's surroundings, ""We enjoyed the concrete Madonnas, and understood the dunes."" But apparently the architects' approach proved unpopular with the neighbors, one of whom stopped speaking to the Liebs after the house was finished."

Plenty of commenters believed Bradshaw's score was the best move, even as quarterback Eli Manning was yelling at him not to. Others believed running the clock down and kicking a field goal was the way to go. Others took sides on the Patriots' decision to allow Bradshaw to score. In all, it made for a lively discussion."

It will remain open after meeting a $1 million fund-raising goal in just a few months, The Seattle Times reported. The theater has been under financial duress for a year. Last February it announced that it needed to raise $500,000 in a matter of weeks and another $250,000 by June and also in September to cover unpaid bills and unreported cost overruns and close other gaps. In April the rest of its 2011 season was canceled, the staff was laid off, and Kate Whoriskey left her post as the theater's artistic director. But as of Monday the Intiman had raised $1,026,263 in pledges since announcing a do-or-die fund-raising campaign in November, the theater's board president, Terry Jones, told The Seattle Times. Under the leadership of a new artistic director, Andrew Russell, the theater is planning a four-play festival in July and August that will feature productions of ''Hedda Gabler,'' ''Romeo and Juliet'' and two other works, to be performed by a 12-person repertory cast."

The cause of death was a stroke due to MRSA. She was 87. An avid collector of Canton and of early American as well as English silver, Joan also had a passion for Yorkshire terriers, art, travel, and social interaction. Fittingly, her favorite author was Jane Austin; her favorite membership, belonging to Nantucket's Wharf Rat Club. The daughter of Alice and Louis S.

Since his first novel, ''Nathan Coulter,'' was published in 1960, Mr. Berry, who farms 125 acres near Port Royal, Ky., with his wife, Tanya Berry, has established himself as a principled and sometimes cantankerous presence in American letters, as known for his advocacy for traditional agriculture and the virtues of rural life and small-scale community as for his more than 40 books of fiction, poetry and essays. He has been an outspoken critic not just of industrialized farming but of industrialized writing, once declaring that writing on a computer instead of his old Royal typewriter would make his work dependent on strip-mined coal. ''I do not see that computers are bringing us one step nearer to anything that does matter to me: peace, economic justice, ecological health, political honesty, family and community stability, good work,'' he wrote in a 1987 essay."

Zinder, a pioneering geneticist and microbiologist whose research on the genetics of bacteria and on the properties of bacteriophages--viruses that infect bacteria--provided important new insights into the mechanisms of heredity. His first major discovery, transduction in bacteria, resulted from experiments performed while he was a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, in collaboration with Joshua Lederberg. After joining Rockefeller in 1952, Dr. Zinder confirmed that transduction occurs when bacteriophages transfer DNA from one bacterial cell to another. This discovery anticipated the introduction of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s. Dr. Zinder's discovery of RNA bacteriophages provided further evidence that RNA carries the blueprint for the manufacture of protein. Dr. Zinder, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, was the University's John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Professor Emeritus. An active spokesman on the responsibilities of scientists, he was an organizer of the historic 1975 Asilomar Conference on the safe use of recombinant DNA techniques and was a founding member of the Human Genome Organization. Dr. Zinder was a gifted teacher and mentor, and he will be greatly missed.

There, large groups of models styled to the hilt in clothes from the house's numerous men's-wear collections milled around highly detailed vignettes or stages, which lent the looks perfect contexts. Bearded mountain men in distressed shearlings and bright plaid and American Indian-inspired flannels with jeans and khakis tucked into boots looked perfectly at home in a roughly hewn mountain cabin. Across the way, an ersatz university club housed nattily suited gents in soft-shouldered tweed sack suits, all from the Polo Ralph Lauren line. Past a glass and steel ski lodge with a million-dollar mountain view, we got a look at the new Black Label Denim collection, in its second season now. The denim- and leather-heavy line had two distinct vibes: one à la ""The Aviator,"" with a coated cotton bomber jacket, sleek knits and double breasted coats in olive and brown. The other, very Brando in ""The Wild One,"" was heavy on the leather with moto-inspired ribbed knits, short zipped jackets and slim utility jeans. My favorite look from this bunch was a short belted black leather jacket with asymmetrical zippers and intricately padded shoulders, shown with a front pant and biker boots. Slick, chic and utterly wearable."

His exuberant 1970s-style dresses, spliced together from silks he designs himself and an eye-popping array of vintage couture brocades, chiffons and georgettes, are prized for their deft handling of color and pattern. In ""Material,"" a monthlong exhibition-cum-pop-up shop Olowu has curated at Salon 94's Freeman Gallery, this passion is given free rein. ""For my collections, I always start with the fabric and then work my way to the designs,"" the designer explains. ""I know so many people who work in this way - not just designers, but jewelers and artists. Everyone starts with the materials."" Arranged in a mise-en-scène alongside pieces from Olowu's spring 2012 collection will be material-inspired objects and art that have in turn inspired him: drawings by Lorna Simpson, photographs by Juergen Teller, woven canvases by Tony Cox, paintings by Katherine Bernhardt, portraits by the 82-year-old Malian photographer Hamidou Maiga, West African textiles and vintage couture fabrics from Abraham of Switzerland. Handling is very much encouraged. ""This is not a precious display of precious things,"" Olowu stresses. ""It's an opportunity to come and shop, to learn about new people and come away with some new ideas."" Whether you leave with a carved wooden coffin in the shape of a Nikon camera from the Ghanian artist Paa Joe or a book on West African architecture, says Olowu, the point is the same: ""It's intended as a visual feast."""

The settlement also provides that the landmarks commission expand its designation of the interior to include a black granite wall that is part of the former vault space. Designed for Manufacturers Hanover Trust by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and completed in 1954, 510 Fifth Avenue, at West 43rd Street, was championed as a historic building akin to modern architectural legends like Lever House and the Seagram Building."

More popularly known as the Harlem Rens, the team won the inaugural World Professional Basketball Tournament in Chicago in 1939. 12:05 P.M. (Encore) THE DOOR IN THE FLOOR (2004) In this adaptation of ''A Widow for One Year'' by John Irving, Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger play Ted and Marion Cole, a long-married couple still reeling from the deaths of their two teenage sons in a car accident some years earlier. Elle Fanning is Ruth, their 4-year-old daughter, whose arrival was meant to help alleviate their grief. And Jon Foster is Eddie O'Hare, a boarding school student who has traveled to the family's home in the Hamptons to spend a summer working as an assistant to Ted, a famous author and illustrator of children's books, but ends up sleeping with Marion. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that this drama from Tod Williams was ''surely the best movie yet made from Mr. Irving's fiction.'' He added: ''It may even belong in the rarefied company of movies that are better than the books on which they are based. And above all, Jeff Bridges offers perhaps the wittiest and richest piece of screen acting by an American man so far this year.''"

''We would like to think that yellow emerged as the hot color of the season for its subtext of optimism,'' said Linda Fargo, the fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman. A hint of what was to come appeared last spring as neon chartreuse (memorably at Christopher Kane and Proenza Schouler). Now there's canary yellow, buttercup, sunflower, lemon chiffon ... Fendi and Chanel are on board. Reed Krakoff. Carven. And women like Shala Monroque are already working the color into their winter wear, here in a yellow top with white trousers under her fur-collar coat. The look is fresh yet season appropriate. You could work yellow into your wardrobe now with a blazer from Rag & Bone, similar to the Stella McCartney style Kirsten Dunst wears here. Or with a sunny rainbow print from Christopher Kane.

Among the documents available on the Web site are notes from Darwin's time aboard the HMS Beagle, pocket diaries, early drafts of works like ""The Origin of Species"" (viewable with and without Darwin's revisions), and previously unpublished manuscripts like an ""experiment book"" describing Darwin's original research on plant breeding strategies, begun in 1856. In addition to revealing Darwin's intellectual evolution, the project also reveals Darwin's sometimes less-than-careful treatment of some of his own papers. Today, a first-edition of the ""Origin"" is a highly sought after rare book, but pages of the original manuscript are even rarer, thanks to Darwin's habit of passing them out as scrap paper. Among the 42 full pages known to survive today, a few feature fanciful drawings on the reverse by his son Francis showing birds undreamed of in the Galápagos Islands as well as a soldier on a carrot battling a cavalier on an eggplant."

Selikoff Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine. Dr. Levin has been a respected member of the Mount Sinai Medical Center for many years and his contributions not only to our organization but to the occupational health community in general are immeasurable. Dr. Levin was what many of us strive to be in occupational medicine: A fierce advocate on behalf of workers and a dedicated, compassionate and gifted physician. He imparted these qualities to the many fellows, residents and medical students whom he taught and mentored. His tireless advocacy for and work with sufferers of asbestos related diseases, WTC related illnesses, and other occupational/environmental conditions was inspiring. Dr. Levin will be remembered for his many contributions in occupational and environmental medicine, including, but not limited to his pioneering work in asbestos related diseases in Libby, MT. His advocacy and unrelenting dedication to thousands of World Trade Center responders who continue to receive health care at Mount Sinai and other clinical centers to this day and his ongoing commitment to promoting worker safety and health not only) in New York State, but on the world stage. Our community was made far better by his presence and his loss will be deeply felt by many. He will be remembered worldwide for his fight against asbestos related diseases, WTC related illnesses, and other occupational/environmental conditions. The Mount Sinai family extends heart-felt condolences to Dr. Levin's loved ones.

The e-mail cited ''overwhelming popularity and demand'' for the decision to extend the production, a musical adaptation of the famed 1935 opera by George and Ira Gershwin and DuBose and Dorothy Heyward. The show, which opened on Jan. 12 to generally positive reviews, was envisioned at one point to run for a year or longer, but the producers opted for a limited 26-week engagement because of concern that last year's controversy over artistic experimentation in the ''Porgy and Bess'' adaptation might put off theatergoers. Referring to the controversy, one of the lead producers, Jeffrey Richards, said in November that he and his colleagues ''didn't know how it would play out,'' so they favored a limited run with the possibility of extending if tickets sold well."

The play, by Lydia R. Diamond, will end its run at the Cort Theater at a financial loss for the play's producers, who include the pop-R&B singer Alicia Keys (she also composed music for the show). Ticket sales were modest throughout the run of ''Stick Fly,'' which opened on Dec. 8 to mixed reviews from critics; the production has grossed a total of $3.25 million. The capitalization for mounting the show had not been disclosed; most Broadway plays cost between $2 million and $3 million, plus weekly operating expenses. Philip J. Smith, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns the Cort Theater, said that he expected another show to open at the theater before April 26, the cut-off date for eligibility for the 2012 Tony Awards. ''Stick Fly'' is directed by Kenny Leon (''Fences'') and stars Dule Hill, Mekhi Phifer, Tracie Thoms, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Rosie Benton, and Condola Rashad, whose performance has been singled out for praise by many critics. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2012-02-10T00:00:00Z,"MACOMBER--Caroline Morgan, died peacefully in her sleep at home on January 27, 2012 after a sudden illness. She grew up in New York City and attended Chapin, Miss Porter's School and Bryn Mawr College (A.B. cum laude). She and her husband, John, were married in 1955 and have three children: Janet Morgan Macomber Williamson, Elizabeth Currie Macomber and William Butts Macomber II. There are six grandchildren. Her family was always her first priority. She was a wonderful mentor and a very wise counselor to all generations. Her grace and kindness were gifts to everyone who knew her. She was also involved in a variety of educational, cultural and conservation activities primarily in Washington and New York. Most recently these included the Boards of The Phillips Collection in Washington, the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York and the North Haven Conservation Partners in Maine. Former board memberships included the American Museum of Natural History of New York, Miss Porter's School (Chair), Wesleyan University, Union Theological, St. James Church (Senior Warden), Ocean Conservancy and Maine Coast Heritage Trust. She served with great distinction and enormous effectiveness and her contributions to each were long lasting and valued by her fellow trustees. She was truly an accomplished woman. For example, her water colors were much sought after but in her modest way she rarely, if ever, signed them. Her creative gardening skill is shown in the unusually imaginative and colorful gardens she created in Sheep Meadow, the family's summer retreat in North Haven, Maine. And she was never happier than when she was sailing her beloved sailboat, the Allouette in the waters of Maine. A Memorial Service will be planned later this spring at St. James Church in New York. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to The Morgan Library in New York or The Phillips Collection in Washington."

Among the documents available on the Web site are notes from Darwin's time aboard the HMS Beagle, pocket diaries, early drafts of works like ''The Origin of Species'' (viewable with and without Darwin's revisions), and previously unpublished manuscripts like an ''experiment book'' describing Darwin's original research on plant breeding strategies, begun in 1856. In addition to revealing Darwin's intellectual evolution, the project also reveals Darwin's sometimes less-than-careful treatment of some of his own papers. Today, a first-edition of the ''Origin'' is a highly sought after rare book, but pages of the original manuscript are even rarer, thanks to Darwin's habit of passing them out as scrap paper. Among the 42 full pages known to survive today, a few feature fanciful drawings on the reverse by his son Francis showing birds undreamed of in the Galápagos Islands as well as a soldier on a carrot battling a cavalier on an eggplant. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
2012-02-11T00:00:00Z,"LOWE--Dr. Charles Upton. 90, of Cambridge, MA died peacefully on February 9. Pediatrician, researcher and educator, he had a long and distinguished career in academic medicine and public service. Born in Pelham, NY, in 1921 to Joseph and Edith (Rosenfield) Lowe, he attended Horace Mann and earned degrees from Harvard College (cum laude) 1942 and Yale Medical School (cum laude) 1945. After an internship at Children's Hospital, Boston, he became chief resident of pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, where his research led him to discover a sex-linked metabolic disorder known as Lowe Syndrome, OCRL (oculo-cerebro-renal) syndrome. In 1948, he joined the University of Minnesota as a National Research Council Fellow and was later appointed Assistant Professor of Pediatrics. Three years later he joined the faculty of the University of Buffalo, NY, where he became Professor of Medicine and a Buswell Fellow. He spent a two-year sabbatical at the Virus Research Laboratory at Cambridge University, England. From 1965-1968, he was professor of pediatrics and director of the Human Development Center at the University of Florida, Gainesville. While there, he completed a national survey of nutrition among pre-school children and conducted studies on the modification of human metabolism in metabolic diseases. In 1968 he became the Scientific Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NIH, Bethesda, MD. He left NICHD to become Special Assistant for Child Health Affairs to the Assistant Secretary of Health in the Ford Administration. He returned to NICHD in 1983, and spent the rest of his career there. One project was working to develop a vaccine for Typhoid fever that took him to Nepal, where he was able to enjoy trekking in the Himalayas and carry on his life-long love of mountain climbing. Among his many contributions while at the NIH, in 1973, he was instrumental in creating an on-site child care center. During his career, Dr. Lowe was awarded many honors, contributed over 100 articles to leading medical and scientific journals, and founded the journal ""Pediatric Research"" for which he served as editor for 12 years. After retiring in 1994, Charles moved to Cambridge, MA, where he immersed himself in Harvard life, by auditing classes, fundraising, and serving as historian and archivist for Lowell House, his undergraduate residence. Dr. Lowe was a skilled wood worker, astute art collector, and avid gardener. He took special pride in restoration of his historic home in Woods Hole, MA that burned down in an accidental fire. In his retirement he wrote, ""Time Out of Mind: An Afghan Adventure,"" a book about his trip through Afghanistan and India in 1954, illustrated with own photographs. Charles is survived by his beloved wife, Barbara Bitting Frazer, his four loving children, Sarah M. Lowe, (Elisabeth Smith) of Brooklyn, NY, Elizabeth E. Lowe of South Hero, VT, J. Stephen Lowe (Jane Ceraso), of Acton, MA and S. Cambria Lowe (Devin Hess) of Berkeley, CA, three treasured grandchildren Sage, Rory, and Simon, his beloved niece and nephew Ann Bookman of Brookline, MA, and Richard Bookman of Miami, FL, one great-nephew and three great-nieces, and his former wife, Eileen Josten Lowe of Brooklyn, NY.

Manya was born on November 6, 1924, in the Bronx, NY to Isidore and Esther Kanof and was a sister to George and Libby. She married Seymour Gussack in March of 1947 and they had five children by the time they moved to New Rochelle in 1960. Amy, Lisa, Faith, Nina and David were the core and center of Manya's world, and she spent much of her time in her kitchen, a furious center of constant activity, being with her children and their friends, all spinning around her kitchen table. Manya's unique ability to beguile and charm and embrace extended naturally to her daughter-in-law, Snow and to her sons-in-law Kermit, Alan, Robert and Allan. Manya first brought her family to Cape Cod, the place she grew to love more than all others, in the summer of 1959. And now the new generation, Manya's grandchildren, Adam, Sophie Rose, Benjamin, Daniel, Jonathan, Rebecca, Natasha, Jessie and Linda spend their summer vacations at ""The Hive"", the family house in Eastham. Manya traveled extensively, both on behalf of her husband's international business and particularly for pleasure with her great friend, Belle. Her adopted families in Japan and Israel are mourning her loss as well. Her legion of friends and admirers has grown exponentially over the years and includes three generations. She had the rare ability to walk into any room and galvanize the people there and to be constantly attuned and attentive to the lives and stories of others. In her presence no one ever felt any less than the center of the universe. Her generosity was legendary, her commitment to fun and adventure was unstoppable. And in her latter years, she and Claudette and Nicola, her loving helpers, formed a unit that was happy and fun and full of life. Manya was a true force of nature - a giving, loving, unassuming woman with wisdom and experience and most especially love, to spare and share. There's only one Manya! If you'd like to remember Manya with a charitable contribution, we would suggest two of her favorites, Beit Hatfutsot, The Museum of the Jewish People (www.bh.org.il/) and Jewish Women International (www.jwi.org). The memorial service will be at 12 noon on Sunday, the 12th at daughter Lisa's home in White Plains, NY. Shiva will begin Sunday and continue through Wednesday from 1pm-7pm daily with 7:30pm Minyan also at Lisa's home."

Until you get to the board shorts and the backpack. In other words, Paul, above, voiced by Seth Rogen and the title character of this comedy from Greg Mottola, is a little green dude. And he comes in peace, man, despite causing havoc while he tries to phone home. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are the best friends, fresh from a Comic-Con convention in San Diego, who run into Paul as they guide their recreational vehicle toward Area 51, the military base in Nevada where the conspiracy-minded think the government stashes aliens. Jason Bateman is one of the men in black hunting Paul; Kristen Wiig is the love interest who wears a T-shirt depicting Jesus blowing away Darwin; and John Carroll Lynch is her daddy, a member of the Bible and gun club. ''As genial, foolish and demographically engineered as it sounds (hailing all fan boys and girls), 'Paul' is at once a buddy flick and a classic American road movie of self- (and other) discovery, interspersed with buckets of expletives and some startling (especially for a big-studio release) pokes at Christian fundamentalism,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Still, she said, ''Paul proves the weak link.'' There's something predictable about using Mr. Rogen's voice for that body, she added, and ''while Paul seems great conceptually, he's not particularly interesting or surprising.'' 10:30 A.M.

Neo-military influences showed up in the mossy palette and details like epaulets and gold buttons. The handbags, which included a new style named after Beckham's daughter Harper, were softer and slouchier, in muted tones of dust and cream.

2012-02-12T17:07:16Z,"""I've got you, Daphne,"" one of Tom Pecheux's assistants said as he led Daphne Groeneveld to a seat at the end of a long table backstage at Derek Lam. Her hair was teased, and she was wearing a black sweater sewn with pearls. Someone brought by an orange and red embroidered dickey collar and asked her if she would mind slipping it on before makeup. Pecheux's team was about to turn her into his version of a naughty schoolgirl using a soft veil of Estée Lauder's new Invisible Fluid Makeup, concealer and powder. Eyebrows were groomed and lashes coated with Sumptuous Two Tone Eye-Opening Mascara to apply black on the top and brown on the bottom. Eyes were lined and spread with smoky burgundy and then a sweep of Sugar Cube white - the same shadow that was dotted in the middle of the lips, and covered in Crystal Pink and Vanilla Truffle lipstick. ""A lovely girly lip color,"" is how Pecheux described the effect. He wanted the girls' mouths to look innocent, just as their eyes were lined to make them appear more youthful - rounder - rather than sultry. The hairstylist Orlando Pita channeled the same lady. ""She's well bred, a little bit intellectual, eccentric, twisted,"" he said of his muse spending a semester at an all-girls school. This translated in to hair blow-dried with Phyto Volumizing Mousse and the T3 Featherweight Luxe, back-combed, curled with the T3 SinglePass Whirl and pinned up for daytime, with loose strands let down at the back come night. Up for day, down for evening? She's totally bucking against the norm."

The second show, which began after a quick pause, had similar features - all black, burgundy, bleach white - and a jaw-dropping cast that included Gisele Bundchen, Shalom Harlow and Carmen Kass.

Hanlon's busy creating what he calls ""skinny hair,"" inspired by the unwashed, matted strands spotted on one of the stylist's assistants. 'It had that few-days-old look,"" said Hanlon, explaining why he wanted the crown to appear as if the girl had been wearing a hat. For those with thicker hair, Hanlon braided lower portions and pinned them close to the head or used a yellow net cap to press tresses down. Fekkai Coiff Anti-Frizz Silkening Crème with Coiff Oceanique Touseled Wave Spray was used all over to help hold the roughed-up strands.

In those moments, in those still-dewy fields, the distance between the present and past collapses.

Visitors will also see new pieces by the Swedish artist Eric Ericson and by the French designer Inga Sempé, whose pewter pitcher, cup and tray recall Ms. Ericson's early career as a pewter designer. And don't miss Svenskt Tenn's newest addition: the most charming tea salon in the city. Not only are the teas, cakes and sandwiches excellent, but tables are set with products from the store. At one end of the room, behind a wall of glass, is a re-creation of the Ericson workroom. A woman of impeccable taste, she had a five-cup-a-day tea habit, and no one knew more about setting the perfect table. STEPHEN WHITLOCK"

Upon graduating from Elba High School as Valedictorian, she attended the Rochester Business Institute and became a medical secretary. In July, 1951 she married Roy C. Tullius, a Lieutenant in the USAF 372nd Bomb Squadron, who was unfortunately killed during a routine B-29 training exercise over the China Sea in February, 1952. Jean then enrolled in The University of Rochester School of Nursing. She graduated Summa Cum Laude in 1955 and went to work at Strong Memorial Hospital, eventually rising to the position of Head Nurse. It was there that she met and later married Dr. Edwin D. Savlov in 1963. Her only son, Marc Haley Savlov, was born on April 14, 1966, and now lives and works as a writer in Austin, TX. In addition to being a incomparable homemaker, wife, and mother, Jean was also a committed community volunteer: in her son's schools, with The Harrington Cancer Center in Amarillo, TX, and at The Assistance League of Reno/Sparks, NV. Throughout her life she was active with the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and many other socially progressive organizations and humanitarian causes. She was also a passionate culinarian and inspired home-gourmet who at one point amassed a library of over 1,400 cookbooks. Her son recalls having to sneak over to the neighbors' house when he was a young boy, the better to enjoy more pedestrian fare such as hot dogs and hamburgers at times when duck a l'orange and veal scallopini were the weekday norm at the Savlov family home. A constant reader of everything from Tennessee Williams to James Patterson and from Erica Jong to P.D. James, Jean was rarely without a book close to hand. Her love of the arts, her warm sense of humor, and her deep empathy for and kindness towards other people touched all who knew her. She was preceded in death by her husband Edwin in 2007, her parents, her sister Elizabeth, and her brother Herbert, a Marine who was killed in action in the Pacific in 1944. She is survived by her son Marc, her stepdaughter Meg Savlov of Seattle, her stepson John Savlov of North Bennington, VT, her grandson Christopher Grisham, and her great-grandson Dorian Grisham.

2012-02-12T00:00:00Z,"LOWE--Dr. Charles Upton. 90, of Cambridge, MA died peacefully on February 9. Pediatrician, researcher and educator, he had a long and distinguished career in academic medicine and public service. Born in Pelham, NY, in 1921 to Joseph and Edith (Rosenfield) Lowe, he attended Horace Mann and earned degrees from Harvard College (cum laude) 1942 and Yale Medical School (cum laude) 1945. After an internship at Children's Hospital, Boston, he became chief resident of pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, where his research led him to discover a sex-linked metabolic disorder known as Lowe Syndrome, OCRL (oculo-cerebro-renal) syndrome. In 1948, he joined the University of Minnesota as a National Research Council Fellow and was later appointed Assistant Professor of Pediatrics. Three years later he joined the faculty of the University of Buffalo, NY, where he became Professor of Medicine and a Buswell Fellow. He spent a two-year sabbatical at the Virus Research Laboratory at Cambridge University, England. From 1965-1968, he was professor of pediatrics and director of the Human Development Center at the University of Florida, Gainesville. While there, he completed a national survey of nutrition among pre-school children and conducted studies on the modification of human metabolism in metabolic diseases. In 1968 he became the Scientific Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NIH, Bethesda, MD. He left NICHD to become Special Assistant for Child Health Affairs to the Assistant Secretary of Health in the Ford Administration. He returned to NICHD in 1983, and spent the rest of his career there. One project was working to develop a vaccine for Typhoid fever that took him to Nepal, where he was able to enjoy trekking in the Himalayas and carry on his life-long love of mountain climbing. Among his many contributions while at the NIH, in 1973, he was instrumental in creating an on-site child care center. During his career, Dr. Lowe was awarded many honors, contributed over 100 articles to leading medical and scientific journals, and founded the journal ""Pediatric Research"" for which he served as editor for 12 years. After retiring in 1994, Charles moved to Cambridge, MA, where he immersed himself in Harvard life, by auditing classes, fundraising, and serving as historian and archivist for Lowell House, his undergraduate residence. Dr. Lowe was a skilled wood worker, astute art collector, and avid gardener. He took special pride in restoration of his historic home in Woods Hole, MA that burned down in an accidental fire. In his retirement he wrote, ""Time Out of Mind: An Afghan Adventure,"" a book about his trip through Afghanistan and India in 1954, illustrated with own photographs. Charles is survived by his beloved wife, Barbara Bitting Frazer, his four loving children, Sarah M. Lowe, (Elisabeth Smith) of Brooklyn, NY, Elizabeth E. Lowe of South Hero, VT, J. Stephen Lowe (Jane Ceraso), of Acton, MA and S. Cambria Lowe (Devin Hess) of Berkeley, CA, three treasured grandchildren Sage, Rory, and Simon, his beloved niece and nephew Ann Bookman of Brookline, MA, and Richard Bookman of Miami, FL, one great-nephew and three great-nieces, and his former wife, Eileen Josten Lowe of Brooklyn, NY.

The park is reducing the 400 permits it issues daily to 300 in 2013.

Originally an industrial base for the aviation and fishing industries, its warehouses and bungalows now house an assortment of surfboard shapers, boutique winemakers and artists. There have always been viable businesses in the area -- Santa Barbara Winery has aged its vintages here for decades -- but a spate of new development is transforming the district from grungy to trendy. The new Indigo Santa Barbara hotel, set to open on the edge of the Funk Zone on Feb. 14, offers a convenient base from which to explore the neighborhood on foot.ELAINE GLUSAC"

Years of viewing Brooklyn Dodgers games on a tiny black-and-white television screen and poring over newspaper photos and newsreels left me completely unprepared for the obvious: that the real-life field of dreams was a sprawling, verdant carpet punctuated by a kaleidoscope of billboards and fans wielding blue and white pennants. Charles W. Cushman's photographs have the same effect. They are a rich reminder that for all the gritty realism of black-and-white photography, 1940s and '50s New York was also resplendent in vivid color."

Manya was born on November 6, 1924, in the Bronx, NY to Isidore and Esther Kanof and was a sister to George and Libby. She married Seymour Gussack in March of 1947 and they had five children by the time they moved to New Rochelle in 1960. Amy, Lisa, Faith, Nina and David were the core and center of Manya's world, and she spent much of her time in her kitchen, a furious center of constant activity, being with her children and their friends, all spinning around her kitchen table. Manya's unique ability to beguile and charm and embrace extended naturally to her daughter-in-law, Snow and to her sons-in-law Kermit, Alan, Robert and Allan. Manya first brought her family to Cape Cod, the place she grew to love more than all others, in the summer of 1959. And now the new generation, Manya's grandchildren, Adam, Sophie Rose, Benjamin, Daniel, Jonathan, Rebecca, Natasha, Jessie and Linda spend their summer vacations at ""The Hive"", the family house in Eastham. Manya traveled extensively, both on behalf of her husband's international business and particularly for pleasure with her great friend, Belle. Her adopted families in Japan and Israel are mourning her loss as well. Her legion of friends and admirers has grown exponentially over the years and includes three generations. She had the rare ability to walk into any room and galvanize the people there and to be constantly attuned and attentive to the lives and stories of others. In her presence no one ever felt any less than the center of the universe. Her generosity was legendary, her commitment to fun and adventure was unstoppable. And in her latter years, she and Claudette and Nicola, her loving helpers, formed a unit that was happy and fun and full of life. Manya was a true force of nature - a giving, loving, unassuming woman with wisdom and experience and most especially love, to spare and share. There's only one Manya! If you'd like to remember Manya with a charitable contribution, we would suggest two of her favorites, Beit Hatfutsot, The Museum of the Jewish People (www.bh.org.il/) and Jewish Women International (www.jwi.org). The memorial service will be at 12 noon on Sunday, the 12th at daughter Lisa's home in White Plains, NY.

Beloved husband of Ginny, devoted father of Peter and Todd, loving father-in-law of Jessica, adoring grandfather of Nate and Will, most loving son of the indomitable Phyllis; dearly loved brother/brother-in-law of Carolyn and Elliot Ross and Pat and Ed Falkenberg. Roger grew up in Shaker Heights, Ohio. He attended Dartmouth College where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and Magna Cum Laude, then went on to earn his MBA at Dartmouth's Amos Tuck School of Business, graduating with High Distinction and winning the Walter A. Jacobs Memorial Award for intellectual curiosity and sound judgment. He earned his LLB from Yale Law School in 1968. He was devoted to all his schools throughout his life and reveled in the fact that both his sons chose to attend Dartmouth. For his first job as a lawyer Roger chose a small New York firm, becoming the 19th lawyer at Skadden Arps. The firm currently numbers over 1800 lawyers. An integral part of the firm's growth and management over the last 40 years, he took great pride and pleasure in the institution that Skadden has become. He loved his work, the Skadden family and his close relationship with his mentor Joe Flom. Over the decades Roger rose as a consummate dealmaker while also serving for more than 20 years as the firm's global Corporate Practice Partner, overseeing Skadden's corporate, M&A, Governance, Finance and Restructuring practices. He was a senior member of the firm's Policy Committee as well as a frequent lecturer and panelist. Throughout his career he served on a number of non-profit boards, including Burke Rehabilitation Hospital, The Legal Aid Society, the New York branches of Teach for America and The American Jewish Committee, and was a co-chair of Mt Sinai Hospital's Crystal Ball. He chaired the Yale Law School Fund and was an original member of Dartmouth's President's Leadership Council. He loved skiing, fishing, biking in Aspen and sharing all these activities with his family and friends. Roger Aaron lived his life fully and with great dedication to the things he believed in. He fought his battle with cancer bravely and privately with the help of talented and extremely caring doctors and nurses. Roger was a source of wise counsel and support for a vast network of family, friends and acquaintances. His tremendous generosity, sharp intellect and thoughtful leadership will be dearly missed. Services will be held on Tuesday, February 14 at 11am, at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street, New York City.

Dr. Levin has been a respected member of the Mount Sinai Medical Center for many years and his contributions not only to our organization but to the occupational health community in general are immeasurable. Dr. Levin was what many of us strive to be in occupational medicine: A fierce advocate on behalf of workers and a dedicated, compassionate and gifted physician. He imparted these qualities to the many fellows, residents and medical students whom he taught and mentored. His tireless advocacy for and work with sufferers of asbestos related diseases, WTC related illnesses, and other occupational/environmental conditions was inspiring. Dr. Levin will be remembered for his many contributions in occupational and environmental medicine, including, but not limited to his pioneering work in asbestos related diseases in Libby, MT. His advocacy and unrelenting dedication to thousands of World Trade Center responders who continue to receive health care at Mount Sinai and other clinical centers to this day and his ongoing commitment to promoting worker safety and health not only) in New York State, but on the world stage. Our community was made far better by his presence and his loss will be deeply felt by many. He will be remembered worldwide for his fight against asbestos related diseases, WTC related illnesses, and other occupational/environmental conditions.

But there is another, rarer side of fashion, when creative minds allow the art world and other influences to enter into their process. There is a rare opportunity to see this play out on the streets of New York. Here are four spectacular examples of people who dress with uncorralled abandon. For them, everything is possible. Many times it's the Eastern and African aesthetic of wrapping, folding or tying cloth on the body, not Western-style tailoring. 1.Louise Doktor, who works at a banking firm, wears a comforter coat, chosen for its color and fabric. 2. A skirt worn as a cape. 3. Two coats buttoned together for the colors, the extra sleeves tied over the shoulder. 4. A sequined curtain as a scarf. 5. On Fifth Avenue, the artist Timothy John wears a bathmat as a jacket, attracted by the nubbly texture. 6. An Indian carpet stitched on both ends and worn vertically one day and horizontally the next. 7. A wall hanging worn as a shawl. 8.Marjorie Stern, a fashion collector, is especially fond of fringe, as her scarves also show. 9.

2012-02-12T00:00:00Z,"ALBERTO ALESSI, the managing director of Alessi, the Italian manufacturer of high-design objects for the home, must have caffeine in his blood. His paternal grandfather, Giovanni Alessi, founded the company in 1921, making metal products like trays, cruet holders and coffee pots. His maternal grandfather, Alfonso Bialetti, invented and produced the first stovetop espresso pot, the Bialetti Moka Express, in the 1930s. The octagonal aluminum coffee maker became -- and remains -- an Italian kitchen staple and a cultural icon. Last year, Alessi, which produces a number of stovetop espresso pots in stainless steel, brought out an aluminum pot, the Moka Alessi, designed by Alessandro Mendini as a tribute to grandfather Bialetti (and a more affordable alternative to its stainless steel models). Soon (in late March), in addition to the three- and six-cup versions, Moka Alessi will be available in the one-cup version ($42) shown here. It'll be great for those of us who are trying to keep our coffee intake to a minimum in the morning. And its diminutive, toylike proportions should prove irresistible. PILAR VILADAS"

The series writer and creator Robert Kirkman's original collaborator, the artist Tony Moore, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday. Mr. Moore claims that Mr. Kirkman has not shared the previously agreed-upon amount of royalty or other payments for the properties they created together, which include ''The Walking Dead,'' ''Brit'' and ''Battle Pope.'' The complaint also alleges that, in 2005, Mr. Kirkman fraudulently persuaded Mr. Moore to assign his rights over to a limited liability corporation controlled by Mr. Kirkman, and that he has not provided access to profit statements for the properties. ''The lawsuit is ridiculous,'' Mr. Kirkman said. ''We each had legal representation seven years ago, and now he is violating the same contract he initiated and approved, and he wants to misrepresent the fees he was paid and continues to be paid for the work he was hired to do. Tony regularly receives payment for the work he did as penciler, inker and for gray tones on the first six issues of 'The Walking Dead' comic series, and he receives royalties for the TV show. To assert otherwise is simply incorrect.''"

Beloved husband of Ginny, devoted father of Peter and Todd, loving father-in-law of Jessica, adoring grandfather of Nate and Will, most loving son of the indomitable Phyllis; dearly loved brother/brother-in-law of Carolyn and Elliot Ross and Pat and Ed Falkenberg.

Jacobs Memorial Award for intellectual curiosity and sound judgment. He earned his LLB from Yale Law School in 1968.

For his first job as a lawyer Roger chose a small New York firm, becoming the 19th lawyer at Skadden Arps. The firm currently numbers over 1800 lawyers. An integral part of the firm's growth and management over the last 40 years, he took great pride and pleasure in the institution that Skadden has become. He loved his work, the Skadden family and his close relationship with his mentor Joe Flom. Over the decades Roger rose as a consummate dealmaker while also serving for more than 20 years as the firm's global Corporate Practice Partner, overseeing Skadden's corporate, M&A, Governance, Finance and Restructuring practices. He was a senior member of the firm's Policy Committee as well as a frequent lecturer and panelist. Throughout his career he served on a number of non-profit boards, including Burke Rehabilitation Hospital, The Legal Aid Society, the New York branches of Teach for America and The American Jewish Committee, and was a co-chair of Mt Sinai Hospital's Crystal Ball. He chaired the Yale Law School Fund and was an original member of Dartmouth's President's Leadership Council. He loved skiing, fishing, biking in Aspen and sharing all these activities with his family and friends. Roger Aaron lived his life fully and with great dedication to the things he believed in. He fought his battle with cancer bravely and privately with the help of talented and extremely caring doctors and nurses. Roger was a source of wise counsel and support for a vast network of family, friends and acquaintances. His tremendous generosity, sharp intellect and thoughtful leadership will be dearly missed. Services will be held on Tuesday, February 14 at 11am, at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street, New York City.

It will be free to download and in a unique twist, if an aspiring performer should want to mount a production of the show, Mr. Daisey will not ask for monetary compensation. ''The monologue will be released as a PDF, and it comes with very open licenses and you can perform it forever, without paying royalties, wherever you want,'' Mr. Daisey said in a telephone interview. The decision comes from his desire to connect with other theater artists and to help organizations who have inquired about the show and want to adapt the work, which describes his trip to Shenzhen, China, and his meetings with factory workers, including those who make Apple products at Foxconn. Mr. Daisey also said he felt that there was no need to stick to the monologue format and that future performers would be free to use the script in any form they choose, even going so far as to suggest an opera adaptation. He did say that the file would come with a few requests, however, like, ''It would be nice if you let me know where it is happening.'' This does not mean that Mr. Daisey will no longer perform the material after his current engagement at the Public Theater ends on March 4. A short run in Britain is planned for the spring.
