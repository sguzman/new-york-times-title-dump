He had a great love of Israeli art and Judaica and spent considerable time in Israel, traveling there regularly for many years. His photographic skills led him to take portraits of many Israeli artists, resulting in a show of his work at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. Stanley was the driving force behind the move of Beth El Synagogue to its current location and the design and construction of its building. He was involved in every aspect of the interior and exterior design, using the work of Israeli artists throughout. He served as President of Beth El for six years. He wrote a book on the synagogue design process, detailing the art in the building and the biblical references in the architecture. Stanley was devoted to philanthropy and was deeply active in many organizations, mostly related to Israeli and Jewish causes.

He was born in New York City and raised in Lakewood, NJ and Loch Sheldrake, NY. In 2007 he became a full-time resident of his lake house in Milford, PA. After graduating from The Wharton School and Columbia Law School, he began his career as an anti-trust trial attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice. He was a young litigation partner at Regan, Goldfarb, Powell & Quinn before co-founding his own successful New York City firms, Solin & Breindel, in 1976, and Breindel & Ferstendig in 1992. A highlight of Howard's career was his argument before the U.S. Supreme Court. After retiring in 2001, Howard served as an arbitrator and mediator for the American Arbitration Association and FINRA. He shared with family and friends his love of books, movies, music, travel, politics, and good food. He was smart, funny, warm, kind and generous. He loved the sun and the water, Elvis, tennis, the New York Giants and Knicks, dancing, a spirited debate, The New York Times, palindromes, blackjack and a nice gin and tonic. He became a devotee of the local gym and Ray-N-Charles, and he brought a smile on his many ""errands"" around town. He had a way with children and could make anyone laugh. The son of a Catskill hotel owner, Howard loved people and was most happy with a house full of family. He was a wonderful friend, mentor and husband to Carol Witschel; a terrific father to his three children, Wendy Huckstepp, Courtney Breindel, and Harlan Breindel and their spouses; a fun and loving Zip (grandfather) to Alex Huckstepp, James Huckstepp, Max Huckstepp and Elias Miller Breindel. He was a delightful uncle to many nieces and nephews, and a much-loved cousin to Marty Friedman and his family. We will all miss him very much. Howard was predeceased by his beloved mother, Helen Breindel Baron and his brother Neal Breindel. All are welcome to join his family to remember and celebrate Howard's life on November 21, from 2-5pm at the Dingman Township Fire House, 680 Log Tavern Road in Milford, PA.

2015-10-28T00:00:00Z,"DAWKINS--John Campbell ""Jack,"" bought his first stock at age 13, and sold his last at 95, just days before he died on October 13, 2015 of complications from a stroke. He was born July 28, 1920 in Fort Worth, TX, and spent his last years in Bennington, VT. A stockbroker on Wall Street for many years, Jack prided himself in his ""old school"" trading habits: a mix of research, intuition, and a remarkable memory for corporate detail. He and his brother, Richard Dawkins, were founding partners of the Wall Street brokerage house, Faulkner, Dawkins and Sullivan, which grew into one of Wall Street's top research firms. In 1977, the firm was acquired by the financier Sandy Weill. A WWII Veteran, Jack enlisted as a Seaman and served in the Pacific at the Battle of Midway, the Doolittle Raid, and the Battle of the Coral Sea. He was serving on the U.S.S. Vincennes when it was sunk in the fiery Battle of Savo Island, and spent twenty-four hours in the water clinging to a piece of wreckage with shipmates. Rescued and recuperating on a small Pacific island, he celebrated by drinking some illegal hooch known as ""torpedo juice,"" made from refining the alcohol in torpedo fuel. Jack wandered off to the beach and fell asleep in the velvety sand, sleeping through roll call the next morning. But his reprimand proved to be a stroke of luck: his commanding officer recommended he be returned to the United States for officer training at Yale University. Jack later returned to the Pacific theater to command a landing craft. His advice to young people? ""Drink the torpedo juice and see what happens."" In 1942, Jack married Jean Turbett. He graduated from Yale in 1946, and lived in Port Washington, where they raised two sons. Jack was predeceased by both sons, Bob and Bill Dawkins, and by his wife, Jean, and all four of his siblings: Thomas Dawkins, Richard B. Dawkins, Joan Dawkins Costin and Christine Dawkins Randall. Survivors include nineteen fond nieces and nephews. A good and generous man with a delightful, self- deprecating sense of humor, Jack touched many people with his kindness, optimism and wit. 1/3"

2015-10-28T00:00:00Z,"BAUM--Charles C. Charles Baum died of pancreatic cancer on October 24 at the age of 73. He will be remembered for his wit and wisdom, love of life, generosity, intelligence, and enthusiasm for learning. Above all, he loved his wife, Patricia, his children, grandchildren, and siblings. Nothing was more important to Charles than family and friends. He was a life advisor, a business advisor, and the best question asker. He had an uncanny ability to maintain deep relationships with friends from summer camp, grade school through graduate school, and beyond. For each person in his life, he remembered a birthday, a favorite moment, a funny line. He was a one-man clipping and search service, well before Google, finding what might be meaningful to each person and sending it with a hand-written note. After spending his childhood in Montgomery, AL, Charles graduated from Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School (Class of '64, Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude), Harvard Business School (Class of '66), and University of Maryland Law School (Class of '79). After Harvard Business School, he went to Wall Street firm Loeb, Rhoades & Co. He moved to Baltimore in 1973 with his first wife, Jane (Shapiro) Rodbell, where he worked at United Iron & Metal (now United Holdings) with his father-in-law I.D. Shapiro. He continued to run the family office until the onset of his illness in the fall of 2015. In the mid '70s through late '90s, he was a partner at Shapiro, Robinson & Associates, advising professional athletes, including Eddie Murray, Brooks Robinson, Cal Ripken Jr., Willie Mays Aikens, and Kirby Puckett. Upon moving to Baltimore, he became quickly ingrained in the city's civic and philanthropic community. He served on the boards of Center Stage, The Aaron and Lillie Straus Foundation, and the University of Maryland Foundation. In addition, he was the Investment Committee chair of the Associated Jewish Charities of Baltimore and was serving as its President at the time of his death. He was a long time member of Beth Am Synagogue. Charles' corporate board service included Baltimore's MuniMae (now MMA Capital Management), investment advisory firm Gabelli Group Capital Partners, and telecommunications company ICTC. He also served as Chairman and CEO of Morgan Group, Inc. and was a special advisor to Baltimore's Charm City Run. Charles had numerous and diverse interests including the arts, literature, sports, travel, and politics; he never missed a day or page of the Baltimore Sun, The New York Times, or Wall Street Journal. He was proud to be involved in Bill Bradley's presidential campaign and served as a Delegate to the 2000 Democratic National Convention. He enjoyed playing sports throughout his life, especially basketball, tennis, and golf, and was an avid spectator, rooting passionately for the Orioles and, above all, for the Alabama Crimson Tide. Charles is survived by his wife Patricia (Purnell) Baum of Severna Park, MD. He had three children, Andrew (1968- 1971), Katie of Berkeley, CA, and Matthew (Deborah) Baum of Baltimore, MD; and two stepdaughters, Staci (Andrew) Hodge of Baltimore and Beth Bafford (Dan Yeoman) of Washington, DC. He received endless joy from his four grandchildren, Beatrice Kennedy and Max Charles Baum and twins Samantha and Riley Hodge. He is also survived by his sister Sylvia (Herb) Horowitz of Columbia, MD and their children Joanne Beren (Jeff Arbeit), Susan Beren (Rodrigo Pizarro), David Beren, Diana England (Richard), Laura Simon (Warren); his brother John (Diane) Baum of Baltimore, MD and their children, Emily Baum (Josh Burke) and David Baum. In addition, he is survived by Jane (nee Shapiro) Rodbell (Stan) of Baltimore, MD to whom he was married from 1966-95. He was predeceased by his mother, Josephine C. Baum and father, Max S. Baum, both of Montgomery, AL. Lastly, he is survived by many friends, whom he loved and who loved him.

While Burt was passionate about his work, he was a husband and father first. He enjoyed nothing more than spending time with his family and teaching life lessons to his children every night at the dinner table.

In 1966 he co-founded Kordet Graphics, which became a premier specialist in pre-press color separations. He served as Kordet's Chairman of the Board until his retirement in 1986. He also served as President of Visual Promotions, Inc, until its merger with the Kordet Group in the mid-1980s. During his nearly 30 years in retirement he, together with his late wife, devoted himself to philanthropic activities, making major differences in many lives both in the Boca Raton, FL area as well as in Nassau County, NY. He was pre-deceased by a brother, Eddie Frederics, and by his devoted wife Florence. He is survived by his son, Richard Friedberg and his wife Courtenay Dodge; his daughter, Diane Houslanger and her husband Marc Houslanger; four grandchildren, Sarah Krohn and her husband Maxwell Krohn, Hannah Orowitz and her husband David Orowitz, Michelle Houslanger, and Joseph Houslanger; and two great- grandchildren. He is also survived by a brother, David Friedberg, and sister, Alice Mulberg. The funeral will take place on Wednesday October 28th at Temple B'nai Israel, Elmont, NY with interment at Beth David Cemetery. 1/3"

A renowned dermatologist, Dr. Klein was one of the first physicians in Los Angeles to diagnose a case of Kaposi's sarcoma, a disfiguring cancer commonly associated with AIDS. Dr. Klein was involved with several AIDS organizations and served on the board of the National AIDS Research Foundation, along with Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson's physician Dr. Michael Gottlieb, and others. That organization merged with the New York-based AIDS Medical Foundation to become amfAR in 1985. We extend our deepest sympathy to Dr. Klein's family.

2015-10-28T00:00:00Z,"BRONSTEIN--Alvin J. The board of directors and staff of the American Civil Liberties Union mourn the passing of Alvin J. Bronstein, a true champion of civil rights and civil liberties. Al founded the A.C.L.U.'s National Prison Project in 1972 at a time when prisoners had virtually no rights. Over the next quarter-century, his tireless efforts on behalf of prisoners led to major reforms in prison systems throughout the country. After his retirement from the A.C.L.U., Al became part of a global movement for prison reform through his work with Penal Reform International. From 1964-1968, Al was Chief Staff Counsel for the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee, which served as a legal arm to the civil rights movement. He represented Martin Luther King, Jr., among many others, during a critical period in this nation's civil rights history. Al was beaten up for his efforts, but he never backed down. Al was more than a great lawyer, he was a moral force. In 1989, he received a MacArthur ""genius award"" for his contributions to prisoners' rights and criminal justice reform. On four different occasions, he was named one of the country's 100 most influential lawyers by the National Law Journal. A memorial will be held in Washington, D.C., at the Washington Ethical Society on Monday, January 18 (MLK, Jr. Day), from 2-4pm. Al's life and work were an inspiration to generations of public interest lawyers. He truly made a difference. Our deep sympathies go to Al's wife, children, and everyone who was touched by this remarkable man. He will be missed. Anthony D. Romero Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union 1/3"

He was born July 28, 1920 in Fort Worth, TX, and spent his last years in Bennington, VT. A stockbroker on Wall Street for many years, Jack prided himself in his ""old school"" trading habits: a mix of research, intuition, and a remarkable memory for corporate detail. He and his brother, Richard Dawkins, were founding partners of the Wall Street brokerage house, Faulkner, Dawkins and Sullivan, which grew into one of Wall Street's top research firms. In 1977, the firm was acquired by the financier Sandy Weill. A WWII Veteran, Jack enlisted as a Seaman and served in the Pacific at the Battle of Midway, the Doolittle Raid, and the Battle of the Coral Sea. He was serving on the U.S.S. Vincennes when it was sunk in the fiery Battle of Savo Island, and spent twenty-four hours in the water clinging to a piece of wreckage with shipmates. Rescued and recuperating on a small Pacific island, he celebrated by drinking some illegal hooch known as ""torpedo juice,"" made from refining the alcohol in torpedo fuel. Jack wandered off to the beach and fell asleep in the velvety sand, sleeping through roll call the next morning. But his reprimand proved to be a stroke of luck: his commanding officer recommended he be returned to the United States for officer training at Yale University. Jack later returned to the Pacific theater to command a landing craft. His advice to young people? ""Drink the torpedo juice and see what happens."" In 1942, Jack married Jean Turbett. He graduated from Yale in 1946, and lived in Port Washington, where they raised two sons. Jack was predeceased by both sons, Bob and Bill Dawkins, and by his wife, Jean, and all four of his siblings: Thomas Dawkins, Richard B. Dawkins, Joan Dawkins Costin and Christine Dawkins Randall. Survivors include nineteen fond nieces and nephews. A good and generous man with a delightful, self-deprecating sense of humor, Jack touched many people with his kindness, optimism and wit. 1/3"

In 1980, Dr. Speiser relocated to Phoenix, Arizona with his family where he worked for several decades as Director of Radiation Oncology at St. Joseph's Hospital and Director of Brachytherapy at Humana Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital. While Burt was passionate about his work, he was a husband and father first.

While Burt encouraged his children to pursue their own dreams, he was never prouder than when his daughter Lisa followed in his footsteps and became a physician. Burt was also an avid reader, hiker, SCUBA diver, and outdoorsman. Burt is survived by his wife of 47 years, Jeanne, his sons Michael and Leonard, his daughter Lisa, his daughters- in-law Mary and Jessica and his seven grandchildren Lauren, Emma, Henry, Anna, Mackenzie, William, and Isabella.

2015-11-01T00:00:00Z,"DeVECCHI--Robert P. The Board of Directors, Overseers and staff of the International Rescue Committee are deeply saddened by the loss of Bob DeVecchi, our former President and CEO. A graduate of Yale University and the Harvard School of Business Administration, and a former Foreign Service Officer with the Department of State, Bob devoted his life to service. With his dedication and leadership, Bob helped build the IRC into a global humanitarian organization. He was a compassionate, gracious and soft-spoken man who was unafraid and relentless in support of refugees and the displaced. Bob joined the IRC in 1975 to lead the organization's efforts in resettling Vietnamese refugees as part of the largest refugee resettlement effort in U.S. history. Under Bob's leadership as Executive Director from 1985 to 1991 and then as President and CEO from 1992 to 1997, the IRC played an increasingly important role in global relief and development while maintaining its position as one of the leading U.S. resettlement agencies. In December 1991, Bob launched the IRC's relief efforts in the Balkans, which provided emergency aid on a large scale in Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia until peace was reached in 1995. During this time the IRC simultaneously responded to refugee crises in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, West Africa, Ethiopia and Rwanda. After retiring from the IRC in 1997, Bob was appointed Adjunct Senior Fellow for Refugees and the Displaced at the Council on Foreign Relations. In 1996 he was awarded the Peacemakers Award of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, D.C., and in 1998 the IRC Freedom Award for his ""extraordinary contribution to the cause of refugees and human freedom."" We are grateful to Bob for his enormous contributions to the IRC and the cause of refugees. In death he joins his beloved wife and partner Betsy Trippe, who passed away in 2009.

He will be remembered for his wit and wisdom, love of life, generosity, intelligence, and enthusiasm for learning. Above all, he loved his wife, Patricia, his children, grandchildren, and siblings. Nothing was more important to Charles than family and friends. He was a life advisor, a business advisor, and the best question asker. He had an uncanny ability to maintain deep relationships with friends from summer camp, grade school through graduate school, and beyond. For each person in his life, he remembered a birthday, a favorite moment, a funny line. He was a one-man clipping and search service, well before Google, finding what might be meaningful to each person and sending it with a hand-written note. After spending his childhood in Montgomery, AL, Charles graduated from Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School (Class of '64, Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude), Harvard Business School (Class of '66), and University of Maryland Law School (Class of '79). After Harvard Business School, he went to Wall Street firm Loeb, Rhoades & Co. He moved to Baltimore in 1973 with his first wife, Jane (Shapiro) Rodbell, where he worked at United Iron & Metal (now United Holdings) with his father-in-law I.D. Shapiro. He continued to run the family office until the onset of his illness in the fall of 2015. In the mid '70s through late '90s, he was a partner at Shapiro, Robinson & Associates, advising professional athletes, including Eddie Murray, Brooks Robinson, Cal Ripken Jr., Willie Mays Aikens, and Kirby Puckett. Upon moving to Baltimore, he became quickly ingrained in the city's civic and philanthropic community. He served on the boards of Center Stage, The Aaron and Lillie Straus Foundation, and the University of Maryland Foundation. In addition, he was the Investment Committee chair of the Associated Jewish Charities of Baltimore and was serving as its President at the time of his death. He was a long time member of Beth Am Synagogue. Charles' corporate board service included Baltimore's MuniMae (now MMA Capital Management), investment advisory firm Gabelli Group Capital Partners, and telecommunications company ICTC. He also served as Chairman and CEO of Morgan Group, Inc. and was a special advisor to Baltimore's Charm City Run. Charles had numerous and diverse interests including the arts, literature, sports, travel, and politics; he never missed a day or page of the Baltimore Sun, The New York Times, or Wall Street Journal. He was proud to be involved in Bill Bradley's presidential campaign and served as a Delegate to the 2000 Democratic National Convention. He enjoyed playing sports throughout his life, especially basketball, tennis, and golf, and was an avid spectator, rooting passionately for the Orioles and, above all, for the Alabama Crimson Tide. Charles is survived by his wife Patricia (Purnell) Baum of Severna Park, MD. He had three children, Andrew (1968- 1971), Katie of Berkeley, CA, and Matthew (Deborah) Baum of Baltimore, MD; and two stepdaughters, Staci (Andrew) Hodge of Baltimore and Beth Bafford (Dan Yeoman) of Washington, DC.

2015-11-01T00:00:00Z,"ZIMBARDO--Rose Abdelnour 1932 - 2015. Our beloved Rosie died in peace at the age of 83, on October 25, surrounded by her son and his family in Davis, California. Rose was born and raised in Brooklyn, the only child of Angie and Albert Abdelnour. She attended Brooklyn College and then Yale University, where she received her doctorate in English Literature in 1960. She had a long and illustrious academic career as a professor at City College of New York, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, the English Department of the University of San Francisco, the Fromm Institute, and the St. Ignatius Institute. Rose was an intellectual giant who turned her energies into becoming a highly celebrated and dedicated teacher of an enormous and varied range of subjects -- from Shakespeare and ancient through modern drama to major historical shifts in human thinking. From the moment she stepped into the classroom until 54 years later, when she retired, Rose brought a joyous but tough energy to teaching her students, whom she loved. They returned her respect and love, and Rose maintained life-long friendships with many of them. For her, teaching was not work; it was challenging yet always exhilarating intellectual interplay with her students. Rose received ""Excellence in Teaching"" Awards from both Stony Brook and the University of San Francisco. Underlying her brilliant teaching was Rose's earnest scholarship. Her research and 10 books about Shakespearean comedies, Tolkien, George Bernard Shaw, Restoration England, and other areas were widely viewed as path- breaking. Her scholarship also expressed her personal philosophy that life veers more into comedy than tragedy. As Rose wrote, ""Mankind is immortal in the comic perspective not by virtue of man's subjugation of nature but by virtue of man's subjection to it. The 'fall' in tragedy ends in death; the fall in comedy ends in bed, where, by nature's arithmetic, one and one make a brand new one."" Rose was preceded in death by her husband of 27 years, Martin Stevens, who was also a professor of English and a dean at Baruch College in New York. She is survived by her son, Adam Zimbardo (from her first marriage to Philip Zimbardo), and also by her two grandchildren, Philip John (""Panda"") and Victoria Leigh (""Bunny"") Zimbardo, who were the joy of her life and the center of her universe. A memorial service in Rose's honor will be held at the Most Holy Redeemer Church in San Francisco, 100 Diamond Street, at 10:00am on November 14, 2015, with a reception to follow. In lieu of flowers, contributions to her memory may be made to either Most Holy Redeemer Church or the Middle East Children's Alliance: www.mecaforpeace.org. 1/3"

2015-11-02T00:00:00Z,"ROSS --H.J. A longtime resident of Coral Gables, Florida, H. J. Ross, age 93, known to his friends as Jack, peacefully passed away at his home on Friday, October 30th, 2015 following an eight year battle with vascular dementia. Jack was born to Benjamina Gaynell Cook Ross and John Daniel Ross on June 2, 1922 in Tampa, Florida. He attended school in Tampa, graduating from Tampa College High (Jesuit High School) as a top scholar and Eagle Scout, and later, at age 19 , from Georgia Institute of Technology, with a degree in civil engineering. Following his graduation from Georgia Tech, where he was a member of Sigma Nu Fratenity, Jack studied aeronautical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology until the outbreak of World War II. He immediately entered military service in the Seabees, an engineering division of the US Navy. Jack was stationed in the Aleutian Islands, and, at the end of the war, at Opa Locka Air Station, Miami, Florida. In 1947, Jack founded the engineering firm Riley and Ross with a fellow Navy engineer. When his partner joined the Vietnam War effort, Jack agreed to stay and run the company, later acquiring a total interest and renaming the company H.J. Ross and Associates, Inc. Jack retired in 1978 and sold the company to Monenco Engineering Corporation. The company has subsequently been sold a number of times but still operates today in Miami as TYLin/H.J. Ross. His firm maintained offices in pre- Castro Cuba, Caracas, Venezuela and throughout Florida, namely in St. Petersburg, Ft. Lauderdale, Cape Canaveral, and Miami. Having designed the test facility for the Pratt/Whitney engines powering the Apollo space mission, H.J. Ross and Associates, Inc. also had a base in Huntsville, Alabama. Among the hundreds of major projects Jack's firm engineered, many are of particular note: signature hotels on Miami Beach including The Eden Roc, The Fontainebleau, The Deauville, and The Shelbourne, all Burdines department stores, the Eastern Airlines buildings at MIA, major parts of the Palmetto Expressway, dozens of facilities for Dade County Public Schools and various Marriott Hotels throughout the country. Jack had many passions: art, thoroughbred horses, history, hunting, boating, fishing and traveling, all of which he actively engaged, living life to the fullest. Jack was a long time member of Epiphany Catholic Church and a former Board Member of Miami Lighthouse for the Blind. He is predeceased by two of his daughters, Barbara Gaynelle Ross and Suzanne Mary Ross, as well as his parents and his sister, Sara Longmire. He is survived by his wife of thirty six years, Audrey Hand Jackson Ross, as well as his two daughters from his first marriage to Donna Guilfoyle Ross, Julie Ross Dunn Myers and Sally Ross Muccio (husband, Craig, and daughter, Donna), all of Miami. His is also survived by his wife's daughter, Melissa Jackson Loree, DVM (husband, Lee, and son, Oliver), of Atlanta, Georgia, as well as a number of nieces and nephews. A service celebrating his life well lived will take place on Tuesday, November 3rd, 2015 at 10:30am at Epiphany Catholic Church, 8235 SW 57th Ave., Miami, Florida 33143. 1/3"

2015-11-04T00:00:00Z,"COONEY--John P.,Jr., died peacefully of lung cancer at home at the age of 71 on November 2, 2015, surrounded by his family. The only son of John P. Cooney, Sr. and Katherine Rafferty Cooney, Jack, as he was known to one and all, was born on October 18, 1944 in Chicago, Illinois, graduated first from Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois, then from college at Indiana University in Bloomington, and thereafter from the Duke University School of Law where he served as Note Editor of the Duke Law Journal. From 1972 to 1977 he was an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York, where he became Chief of the Narcotics Unit. In 1977 he returned to the New York City law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP from which he retired in 2008 after which he became a Principal at McKool Smith, P.C. Jack's time in private practice spanned a period of remarkable growth in the prosecution of white-collar crime, and Jack's career made him one of the pre- eminent white-collar practitioners of his day. He defended countless individuals and corporations in grand jury, regulatory and other governmental investigations, both in the United States and abroad. Because Jack's cases frequently resulted in the prosecution dropping charges or not proceeding with them, his success in these cases--from those involving insider trading and anti-trust violations to others under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act--were known perhaps more often by his grateful clients and his brethren at the Bar than by the newspapers. Although some of his clients were well-known, many others were not: these were clients Jack represented by appointment by the court under the Criminal Justice Act because they were unable to pay a lawyer to represent them. Not only did these clients get the same dogged, deft and passionate representation that Jack devoted to his other clients, they got the same outstanding results. Beyond this professional pre- eminence, Jack's life embraced an unalloyed joy and enthusiasm for his pursuits--outdoors in his beloved Tetons, shooting pheasant, rooting for the Duke Blue Devils, and being with his many dear friends in New York City, Rye, NY and Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Most of all, he cherished his time with the family he so loved and now leaves: his wife, Jane (Hewett); his sons John, Brian, Luke and Nathaniel, his daughters Anne and Emma, and his grandchildren Alexa and Patrick. Jack's sister, Judith Ann Cooney, predeceased him. All these family and friends will miss Jack's consuming interests in history, literature and poetry; his lectures on the fine points of college basketball and football and major league baseball; his disquisitions on the merits of this or that Super Tuscan; but most of all his brave and ready embrace of life with all its highs and lows and of love in its every manifestation. We who are left are left, indeed, to reflect that ""we shall not look upon his like again."" The family will receive visitors at home on Tuesday, November 10, 2015 from 4 to 8pm. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held on November 11, 2015 at 11:15am at The Church of the Resurrection, 910 Boston Post Road, Rye, N.Y. Contributions in lieu of flowers may be made in Jack's memory to the Inner City Scholarship Fund, 1011 First Avenue, 14th Floor, New York NY 10022 (innercityscholarshipfund.org) or to the Yellowstone Park Foundation, 222 E.

2015-11-04T00:00:00Z,"McILWAIN--Robert Moore. Of Bernardsville, NJ, and Vero Beach, FL, passed away on Saturday, October 24, 2015, a few days before his 88th birthday, and not long after he attended his 65th reunion at Dartmouth College. Bob enjoyed a full life with his wife Joan, sons Robert, John, David and Bill, daughters- in-law Michaela, Melissa, AnnMarie and Halley, grandchildren Chelsea, Russell, Jenny, Wesley, Juliet, Charlie and Elizabeth, a close extended family, and many special friends from Dartmouth, New Jersey, Florida and around the globe. He grew up in Radnor, PA, the son of the late Hugh and Evelyn McIlwain, with his younger brothers Pete and Tom. He graduated from The Haverford School, Haverford, PA, and spent a year in the Coast Guard before entering Dartmouth College, where he earned a bachelor of arts degree, followed by a master's degree at the college's Thayer School of Engineering and a master of business administration degree from the Tuck School of Business. Bob loved Dartmouth. He was a class president as an undergraduate and never missed a class reunion in 65 years. After college, he served as a lieutenant in the Navy for three years, then worked for McKinsey & Company, Singer Corporation, Warner- Lambert and Engelhard Corporation. He spent the last 13 years of his career as a senior executive at Englehard, retiring from there in 1992. Meeting and marrying his wife Joan was the most important event of his life. For 57 years they had a wonderful time raising four boys and having great fun with their friends and family. They enjoyed tennis, skiing, golf, dancing and bridge, and traveled to many parts of the world. Also, they were active supporting their communities. More than anything, Bob loved his family, grandchildren, his extended family and his many, many good friends. He was exceptional with people - attentive, bright, fun, humorous and loyal. He had a way with people that let them know how special they were. He loved life fully, and it meant a great deal to him to share and enjoy life with others. We will all miss his presence in our lives - his generosity and wisdom, his warm smile and the twinkle in his eyes. A service to celebrate Bob's life will be held at 11am on Saturday, November 7, at the Church of St. John on the Mountain, 379 Mount Harmony Road in Bernardsville, NJ.

Born in New York on April 1, 1939, she was married for 45 years to her beloved husband Alex C. Ewing, following the death of her first husband Michael deShee Clarke. She graduated from Vassar College in 1961, and earned masters degrees from Columbia University and Sarah Lawrence. With a firm and loving hand, she raised four children, daughter Cecilia Clarke and stepchildren Sandy, Eric and Caroline Ewing, in Millbrook, NY, where she lived from 1970 to 1990. When Alex's appointment as Chancellor of the North Carolina School of the Arts unexpectedly brought them to Winston-Salem, she embraced with gusto her new role as First Lady of NCSA. In addition, she performed in plays, wrote book reviews and travel articles, volunteered at a hospital, sang in the St. Paul's Church choir, maintained a beautiful flower garden, and played tennis and a matchless game of Scrabble. A lifelong lover of Ireland, she and Alex returned frequently to their home-away-from-home in County Cork. She lived her life with verve, style, unflagging humor and impeccable taste, and brought forth beauty from whatever she touched. She was the best friend not only of her husband but also of an astonishing number of others. She saw people deeply, and in their most critical moments reached them with her unerring insight, often expressed in long-treasured letters. In everything she did, she set very high standards for herself and always met them. In addition to her husband Alex and her four children, she is survived by her brother John Whitehouse Cobb of Denver, Colorado, her sister Victoria Mackintosh of Alresford, Hampshire, England, and eight grandchildren: Allegra Eifler, Josephine and Simon Born, Alden and Caleb Ewing, and Nathan, Seth and Henry Ewing-Crystal. The funeral will be Monday, November 9, at 11am at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Winston-Salem. Contributions may be made in Sheila's memory to the Sheila Cobb Scholarship at the North Carolina School of the Arts. 1/3"

Jack, as he was known, was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1972 to 1977 and was Chief of the Narcotics Unit during 1976-77. A signal highlight of his trial career, among many such, was the conviction of Vincent Papa, a mob kingpin of the narcotics trade in New York. Papa was arrested in The Bronx with a million dollars in cash in the trunk of his car, which Jack introduced into evidence against him thus sealing his fate at trial. After his career as a federal prosecutor Jack earned an unrivalled reputation as a lion of the bar representing individuals and corporations in an ever-widening spectrum of white-collar criminal cases and defending indigent defendants under the Criminal Justice Act with superb talent, real grit and utter determination. A Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers, Jack was a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell for 30 years before his retirement in 2008 when he joined McKool Smith, PC as a Principal. His wit, his enthusiasm and his charm will be missed both by his colleagues in the Association and by those on the bench and at the bar more generally. Our sympathy and condolences are extended to his wife Jane and his children and grandchildren. 1/3"

Retired New York City public school principal, ardent reader and supporter of the arts, and devoted wife, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend, died November 5, in Great Barrington, MA, of an intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke. Born in Brooklyn on May 31, 1930, she was married for 60 years to Martin Greene and together with him took loving care of their two daughters and four grandchildren. She managed to combine being feisty and outspoken with tenderness, great warmth, and a keen sense of humor. She graduated from New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn in 1948, from New York University with a BA, and from St. John's University with an advanced degree in school administration. An intellectual force and a master of the English language, Barbara had a long career in the city schools: as an English teacher sharing her love of language and literature and as a guidance counselor at Benjamin Franklin High School in Manhattan, encouraging many students to become the first person in their family to attend college and numerous others to pursue their dreams through higher education; as an assistant principal at Jane Addams High School in the Bronx; as a principal at William E. Grady, a vocational high school in Brooklyn; and then as the principal of Newtown High School in Elmhurst. In 1992, Barbara announced she was becoming ""leisured for life."" She retired to spend more time with her family and her beloved English literature, to travel, and to enjoy endless hours at her home in South Egremont, MA, in the Berkshires, reading The New York Times in her favorite sunny spot, on her deck next to an apple tree. In addition to her husband Martin, Barbara is survived by two of her sisters, Carol and Jacqueline; two daughters, Elizabeth and Alice; her son-in-law, Curtis Jones; and her four grandchildren: Sam and Ruby Jones and Isabella and Thomas Mungioli.

A lifelong lover of Ireland, she and Alex returned frequently to their home-away-from-home in County Cork.

She was the best friend not only of her husband but also of an astonishing number of others.

Above all else, she loved her family - who loved her deeply, were blessed to have her grace their lives, and who now have the privilege of carrying on her rich legacy.

Mel has given over 50 years of service to Bnai Zion, establishing his first Bnai Zion chapter when he was a teenager. Mel joined the staff of Bnai Zion in 1964 and was elected its National Secretary in 1976. He was then elected to the position Executive Vice-President in June 1983 and retired in July 2006. Even after his retirement he continued to be a driving force within the organization and lent his expertise wherever it was needed. The Bnai Zion Foundation grew in both scope and fundraising capacity during Mel's tenure. Mel's efforts led to a greatly expanded profile of the organization and increased contributions to its projects. He was a dynamic speaker and had been active in many Jewish organizations, including the America-Israel Friendship League, Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the American Zionist Movement, the American Red Magen David, the Israel Dance Institute, and Israel Bonds. He was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Jewish National Fund. Mel exemplified what it means to be a dedicated Zionist, humanist and American Jew. The funeral will take place on Sunday, November 8th, at 12:30pm at Eden Memorial Chapels, 327 Main Street Ft Lee, NJ 07024. Our hearts go out to his wife Arlyne, their children, Bari and Alan Shaffran, and Caryn and Keith Evans, and their grandchildren, Lizzie, Jonathan, Emerson, Andrew and Brady, and may his entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.

2015-11-07T00:00:00Z,"McGREEVY--Molly Paine, died on Sunday, November 1, 2015, at her home in Pittsford, NY. Born on June 11, 1936, to Hugh Eustis Paine and Helen Duncan Paine, she graduated from The Chapin School and Vassar College, completing as her senior thesis a play based on her favorite childhood character, Mary Poppins. After college, Molly moved to Paris to study mime under Marcel Marceau. Returning to Manhattan, she met and married stockbroker Thomas James McGreevy and then moved to Kansas City, MO, where their three daughters were born. A free spirit with a wild sense of humor, she told her daughters that she brought the new dance ""The Twist"" to that reserved Midwestern town. Molly resumed her career as an actress in local theatre, in the movie ""Shoot it Black, Shoot it Blue"" (1974), and as Polly Longworth in the TV soap opera Ryan's Hope (between 1977 and 1981). She also produced the documentary ""Nothing by Chance"" (1975). She married actor Earl Hindman in 1976 and moved to Stamford, CT, where he continued his acting career in movies, theatre, and TV (playing Wilson, the ""Hi-di- ho"" neighbor in ""Home Improvement"" who was never seen except for his head looking over the fence). Changing course, Molly received her Master of Divinity from The General Theological Seminary in New York City in 1986. She was ordained a deacon in the Episcopal Church on June 10, 1989, and was ordained a priest on December 1, 1989. During the height of the 1980s AIDS crisis in New York, Molly worked as a chaplain at Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospital, New York, NY, and as an assistant to the rector at the Church of St. Luke in the Fields (from 1989 to 1996), providing funeral services to over 60 AIDS victims and their families. She became the associate priest at St. Francis Episcopal Church in Stamford, CT, from 1996 until her retirement in 2005, after which she moved to Pittsford, in 2009 to be closer to her grandchildren.

2015-11-08T00:00:00Z,"GREEN--Dr. Howard. After a long illness, Dr. Howard Green passed away on October 31, 2015. Dr. Green was born September 10, 1925 in Toronto, Canada. He received his Doctorate in Medicine from the University of Toronto in 1947 and was to spend the rest of his life in medical research. After serving two years as a Captain in the United States Army, he began his career at New York University School of Medicine in 1956 and eventually rose to become Professor and Chairman of the Department of Cell Biology. From 1970 to 1980, he was a Professor of Cell Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1980, he became the George Higginson Professor of Cell Biology and Chairman of the Department Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School. He stepped down as Chairman in 1993, but continued on as Professor and actively ran his laboratory until 2013. Over the years, Dr. Green's work focused mainly on the properties of cells growing in tissue culture. In 1961, his laboratory created and established lines of fibroblast cells using viral oncogenes. Further development in his laboratory and in others led to the 3T3 cell lines, which became the basis for much work on cellular oncogenes. In 1974, using the same lines of 3T3 cells for support; his laboratory developed a system that allowed the cultivation of large numbers of human skin cells. Sheets of these cultured cells behaved as skin grafts when applied to open wounds. These grafts were first tested on small burn wounds in the Burn Unit at the Brigham and Women's Hospital starting in 1978 and they regenerated a functioning epidermis in these patients. This method of taking a tiny skin sample from a patient and using it to generate enough cultured grafts to cover large areas of the body with the patients own cells was used in children with large burns for the first time in 1983 at the Shriners' Burn Hospital in Boston. This work, in addition to being life saving, was the first use of stem cells as a successful treatment in patients. In order to cope with the demand for these grafts, Dr. Green founded BioSurface Technology. The company was acquired by the Genzyme Corporation, where production continues to the present day. In recognition of this pioneering work, Dr. Green received multiple honors including membership in the National Academy of Sciences (USA), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Institut de France (Academie des Sciences). He was the President of Scientific Council, Institut Curie, Paris, France from 1999 to 2007. He was awarded the Legion d'Honneur, Republic of France, and received honorary Doctorates from the University of Connecticut, the University of Goteborg, Sweden, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and Louisiana State University. In addition, he received the following awards: the Blaise Pascal Medal for Biology and Life Sciences of the European Academy of Sciences, 2007; the Warren Alpert Foundation Prize, 2010; and the March of Dimes Prize in Developmental Biology, 2012. Dr. Green is survived by his wife of sixty-one years, Rosine Kauffmann Green, his brother Floyd, his niece Ingrid Fagen, and his nephew David, as well as an extended family in Canada, the United States, Australia, and France. 1/3"

2015-11-08T00:00:00Z,"COONEY--John P.,Jr., died peacefully of lung cancer at home at the age of 71 on November 2, 2015, surrounded by his family. The only son of John P. Cooney, Sr. and Katherine Rafferty Cooney, Jack, as he was known to one and all, was born on October 18, 1944 in Chicago, Illinois, graduated first from Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois, then from college at Indiana University in Bloomington, and thereafter from the Duke University School of Law where he served as Note Editor of the Duke Law Journal. From 1972 to 1977 he was an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York, where he became Chief of the Narcotics Unit. In 1977 he returned to the New York City law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP from which he retired in 2008 after which he became a Principal at McKool Smith, P.C. Jack's time in private practice spanned a period of remarkable growth in the prosecution of white-collar crime, and Jack's career made him one of the pre- eminent white-collar practitioners of his day. He defended countless individuals and corporations in grand jury, regulatory and other governmental investigations, both in the United States and abroad. Because Jack's cases frequently resulted in the prosecution dropping charges or not proceeding with them, his success in these cases--from those involving insider trading and anti-trust violations to others under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act--were known perhaps more often by his grateful clients and his brethren at the Bar than by the newspapers. Although some of his clients were well-known, many others were not: these were clients Jack represented by appointment by the court under the Criminal Justice Act because they were unable to pay a lawyer to represent them. Not only did these clients get the same dogged, deft and passionate representation that Jack devoted to his other clients, they got the same outstanding results. Beyond this professional pre- eminence, Jack's life embraced an unalloyed joy and enthusiasm for his pursuits--outdoors in his beloved Tetons, shooting pheasant, rooting for the Duke Blue Devils, and being with his many dear friends in New York City, Rye, NY and Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Most of all, he cherished his time with the family he so loved and now leaves: his wife, Jane (Hewett); his sons John, Brian, Luke and Nathaniel, his daughters Anne and Emma, and his grandchildren Alexa and Patrick. Jack's sister, Judith Ann Cooney, predeceased him. All these family and friends will miss Jack's consuming interests in history, literature and poetry; his lectures on the fine points of college basketball and football and major league baseball; his disquisitions on the merits of this or that Super Tuscan; but most of all his brave and ready embrace of life with all its highs and lows and of love in its every manifestation. We who are left are left, indeed, to reflect that ""we shall not look upon his like again."" The family will receive visitors at home on Tuesday, November 10, 2015 from 4 to 8pm. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held on November 11, 2015 at 11:15am at The Church of the Resurrection, 910 Boston Post Road, Rye, N.Y.

Born on June 11, 1936, to Hugh Eustis Paine and Helen Duncan Paine, she graduated from The Chapin School and Vassar College, completing as her senior thesis a play based on her favorite childhood character, Mary Poppins. After college, Molly moved to Paris to study mime under Marcel Marceau. Returning to Manhattan, she met and married stockbroker Thomas James McGreevy and then moved to Kansas City, MO, where their three daughters were born. A free spirit with a wild sense of humor, she told her daughters that she brought the new dance ""The Twist"" to that reserved Midwestern town. Molly resumed her career as an actress in local theatre, in the movie ""Shoot it Black, Shoot it Blue"" (1974), and as Polly Longworth in the TV soap opera Ryan's Hope (between 1977 and 1981). She also produced the documentary ""Nothing by Chance"" (1975). She married actor Earl Hindman in 1976 and moved to Stamford, CT, where he continued his acting career in movies, theatre, and TV (playing Wilson, the ""Hi-di- ho"" neighbor in ""Home Improvement"" who was never seen except for his head looking over the fence). Changing course, Molly received her Master of Divinity from The General Theological Seminary in New York City in 1986. She was ordained a deacon in the Episcopal Church on June 10, 1989, and was ordained a priest on December 1, 1989.

She became the associate priest at St. Francis Episcopal Church in Stamford, CT, from 1996 until her retirement in 2005, after which she moved to Pittsford, in 2009 to be closer to her grandchildren. Her sense of humor, opposition to injustice, and love of all God's creatures (especially her grandchildren and corgis) distinguished her clerical duties, and her prior career as an actress gave an added ""elan"" to her preaching. All who knew her will remember her with great love. She is survived by her three daughters, Pamela McGreevy of Pittsford, Jessica McGreevy of Norwalk, CT, and Barbara McGreevy of Shawnee Mission, KS, and her grandchildren, Natalie Newman and Alexander Newman of Pittsford.

Charlie is lovingly remembered by his four children and their spouses: Sally L. Swift (and Edward) of Carlisle, MA; Diana L. Hammond (and Peter) of Perth, Australia; Lucy L. LaCasse (and William) of Scarborough, ME; and Charles C. Lee, III (and Eliza) of Philadelphia, PA. He is also survived by 11 grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, his sister Mary L. Lambert of New York City, and many much loved nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his sisters Eleanor L. Congdon and Cynthia L. Russell, and his brother Thomas S. Lee. Charlie attended St. Bernard's School in New York City, Middlesex School in Concord, MA, and graduated from Yale University in 1950. After college, he enlisted in the Marine Corps and served as a captain in Korea. Upon returning, Charlie worked briefly for Bates Manufacturing before joining White Weld & Co. in 1955, from which he retired as Vice Chairman upon the sale of the firm in 1978. Following his retirement, Charlie was involved in several business ventures, both in banking and corporate philanthropy. However, the majority of his time was devoted to service on a variety of school boards, community organizations and numerous affiliations with the Episcopal Church. Charlie served as the Head of the Board of Trustees at Middlesex School and Far Hills Country Day School; Head of the Vestry of St. John's on the Mountain in Bernardsville, NJ; Senior Warden at Trinity Church in New York City; and as a Trustee of General Theological Seminary in New York City, from which he received an honorary Doctorate degree in 2001. Charlie and Sally raised their four children in Far Hills, New Jersey and moved to Spring Island, South Carolina in 1998. He and Sally traveled extensively, visiting over 50 countries, exploring the natural and cultural wonders of the world. Charlie will be fondly remembered for his devotion to his wife Sally, his love of extended family, his wisdom and his wry sense of humor. He enjoyed golf with family and friends (where he showed occasional flashes of brilliance), Sunday night picnics and cribbage games with his grandchildren. All who knew Charlie will remember his quiet counsel and compassion that he imparted with humility and grace. A memorial service for Charles C Lee will be held on November 18th at 1:30pm at Trinity Church, 75 Broadway, New York City. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in his memory to St. James Church, 499 Black Point Rd, Scarborough, ME 04074 or to the Spring Island Trust Foundation, 40 Mobley Oaks Lane, Okatie, SC 29909. Services are being handled by Hobbs Funeral Home, 230 Cottage Road, Scarborough, ME. 1/3"
2015-11-08T00:00:00Z,"BOEGEHOLD--Alan Lindley (1927-2015) was born March 21, 1927 in Detroit, Michigan.

2015-11-08T00:00:00Z,"TRAINOR--Patricia H. Patricia H. Trainor, a longtime resident of Greenwich Village in New York City, died peacefully at her home on Sunday, November 1. Patricia was a rebel who refused to walk down the paths allotted to women in the late 1950s. Instead of teaching in the suburbs after graduating from the College of New Rochelle, she taught school in Cuba during the first year of the Castro regime. And while some toiled as secretaries in Manhattan, she did so in Zurich, where she socialized after work in four languages and traveled widely. Returning to New York City, she searched the Help Wanted-Male ads in The New York Times and was hired by Sinclair Oil as a computer programmer trainee, an almost entirely male profession at the time. While with Sinclair, she rose to become the manager of systems programming. Ironically, as one of the founders of the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women in 1966, Patricia was instrumental in abolishing the practice of segregating help wanted ads by sex. She also chaired NOW's Image of Women committee, which campaigned to change the stereotyped image and denigration of women in mass media. Inspired by the leak of the Pentagon Papers in 1971, Patricia enrolled at New York University School of Law and received her LL.M. During that time she organized her neighbors in their tenement building, who were facing threat of eviction from a developer. Under her leadership, they were able to buy the building and eventually refurbish it into a charming residence. It was one of the first buildings in the West Village to go co-op. In 1995 she represented the Association of the Bar of the City of New York at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, and she continued to practice contract law until her retirement in 1996. A world traveler and patron of the arts, she loved attending the theater and concerts with friends, believing it was art that would save the world, not politics. Patricia recently said, ""I have done everything I have ever wanted to do; I have gone everywhere I have ever wanted to go."" Predeceased by her young brother, John, and her parents, Helen and Charles Trainor, Patricia is survived by her brother, Thomas, of Yonkers, NY, her sister, Marilyn Wellisch, of Long Beach, NY, and other loving family members. Her family and many friends, including her fictive grandson, Cameron Gomez, will greatly miss her laughter, generosity, lively wit and sharp intellect. 1/3"
2015-11-08T00:00:00Z,"COONEY--John P.,Jr. The Robert B. Fiske Jr. Association mourns the passing of its esteemed and beloved member and colleague John P. Cooney, Jr. on Monday, November 2, 2015 at the age of 71. Jack, as he was known, was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1972 to 1977 and was Chief of the Narcotics Unit during 1976-77. A signal highlight of his trial career, among many such, was the conviction of Vincent Papa, a mob kingpin of the narcotics trade in New York. Papa was arrested in The Bronx with a million dollars in cash in the trunk of his car, which Jack introduced into evidence against him thus sealing his fate at trial. After his career as a federal prosecutor Jack earned an unrivalled reputation as a lion of the bar representing individuals and corporations in an ever-widening spectrum of white-collar criminal cases and defending indigent defendants under the Criminal Justice Act with superb talent, real grit and utter determination. A Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers, Jack was a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell for 30 years before his retirement in 2008 when he joined McKool Smith, PC as a Principal. His wit, his enthusiasm and his charm will be missed both by his colleagues in the Association and by those on the bench and at the bar more generally. Our sympathy and condolences are extended to his wife Jane and his children and grandchildren. 1/3"

He served as Chairman of the Board of trustees from 1985 to 1987, and President of the University from 1987 to 1993. Through the challenging times of the civil war, he fought to keep the University's doors open and its students safe, even while Americans were barred from travelling to Lebanon. From the President's office in New York City, he fostered a vision of AUB as a world class university and medical center, and a beacon of moderation and understanding in the Middle East. A highly respected surgeon and teacher, Herter received his undergraduate degree from Harvard College, his M.D. from Harvard Medical School, and did post-graduate training in surgery at the Presbyterian Hospital, where he faithfully spent his medical career for nearly half a century. He was a pioneering surgeon and role model to generations of medical students, residents and faculty members while serving as the Auchincloss Professor of Surgery at Columbia University; Acting Chairman of Department of Surgery at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, Acting Director of Surgery at Presbyterian Hospital, Director of Surgery at Francis Delafield Hospital; a trustee of Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital, Jackson Laboratories, and American Near East Refugee Aid; a regent of Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York; a member of the board of governors of the Middle East Institute, Washington; a member of the board of advisers of the Hariri Foundation USA; and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. The scion of a distinguished New York family, Herter embodied the best qualities of leadership: inquisitiveness, determination, sensitivity, sense of purpose, and compassion.

He was a member of the John Jones Surgical Society. He served as director of surgery at the Francis Delafield Hospital in New York, consultant at the Harlem and Goldwater Memorial Hospitals, and consultant at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. After his tenure at Columbia, he was appointed President of the American University of Beirut, where he served for eight years, during the troubled times of the Syrian Civil War.

He served as Chairman of the Board of trustees from 1985 to 1987, and President of the University from 1987 to 1993. Through the challenging times of the civil war, he fought to keep the University's doors open and its students safe, even while Americans were barred from travelling to Lebanon. From the President's office in New York City, he fostered a vision of AUB as a world class university and medical center, and a beacon of moderation and understanding in the Middle East. A highly respected surgeon and teacher, Herter received his undergraduate degree from Harvard College, his M.D. from Harvard Medical School, and did post-graduate training in surgery at the Presbyterian Hospital, where he faithfully spent his medical career for nearly half a century. He was a pioneering surgeon and role model to generations of medical students, residents and faculty members while serving as the Auchincloss Professor of Surgery at Columbia University; Acting Chairman of Department of Surgery at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, Acting Director of Surgery at Presbyterian Hospital, Director of Surgery at Francis Delafield Hospital; a trustee of Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital, Jackson Laboratories, and American Near East Refugee Aid; a regent of Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York; a member of the board of governors of the Middle East Institute, Washington; a member of the board of advisers of the Hariri Foundation USA; and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. The scion of a distinguished New York family, Herter embodied the best qualities of leadership: inquisitiveness, determination, sensitivity, sense of purpose, and compassion. His legacy is a resolute belief in the ability of individuals and societies to work together for the benefit of humankind, which elevated everyone in his presence, and left the world a better place. He is survived by his beloved wife, Solange; sister, Adele Seronde; son, Eric; daughters, Caroline and Brooke; stepson, Marc; stepdaughters, Mary, Veronique and Jacqueline; and many grandchildren.

2015-11-12T00:00:00Z,"WESTON--Burns H.,Bessie Dutton Murray, Distinguished Professor of Law Emeritus at the University of Iowa, died on October 28, 2015, a few days before his 82nd birthday. After surviving numerous challenges to his health, Weston was writing new books and developing human rights projects. His death was unexpected and sudden. After turning away a promising career as a pianist or conductor, Weston graduated from Yale Law School and began his legal career in 1961 with a distinguished New York law firm. Thereafter, he joined The University of Iowa College of Law, where he nurtured and inspired generations of law students and ""put Iowa Law on the map"" of international law and human rights. Weston authored over 28 books, wrote innumerable articles, and was on the editorial board of over 10 professional journals. In addition to taking part in numerous fact-finding human rights missions, he founded the University of Iowa Center for Human Rights (UIHCR) in 1999. Weston lectured, wrote and taught about pressing issues facing our planet: nuclear disarmament, apartheid, child labor, human rights and lately environmental survival. He co-authored (with David Bollier) a ground-breaking book ""Green Governance: Ecological Survival, Human Rights, and the Law of the Commons"" in 2012 and was, at the time of his death, in the final stages of completing the 4th edition of ""Human Rights in the World Community: Issues and Action"", with co-author, Anna Grear. Weston had a limitless capacity to enjoy so much about this world--and an equally tenacious drive to improve it. He embraced the world ""with all five senses""--he was most passionate about classical music, but also loved art, travel and movies. He was happiest in the Adirondack Mountains. He was a devoted spouse, father, grandfather and brother. Weston is survived by his wife, Marta Cullberg Weston (Stockholm), his sister, Monique Weston (New York) and his two children, Timothy Bergmann Weston (Colorado) and Rebecca Burns Weston (Montana), four grandchildren, three Swedish stepchildren, and their five children. A memorial service in honor of Weston will be held by the Iowa College of Law, Iowa City on December 5, 2015 at 2pm. 1/3"

He served as Chairman of the Board of trustees from 1985 to 1987, and President of the University from 1987 to 1993. Through the challenging times of the civil war, he fought to keep the University's doors open and its students safe, even while Americans were barred from travelling to Lebanon. From the President's office in New York City, he fostered a vision of AUB as a world class university and medical center, and a beacon of moderation and understanding in the Middle East. A highly respected surgeon and teacher, Herter received his undergraduate degree from Harvard College, his M.D. from Harvard Medical School, and did post-graduate training in surgery at the Presbyterian Hospital, where he faithfully spent his medical career for nearly half a century. He was a pioneering surgeon and role model to generations of medical students, residents and faculty members while serving as the Auchincloss Professor of Surgery at Columbia University; Acting Chairman of Department of Surgery at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, Acting Director of Surgery at Presbyterian Hospital, Director of Surgery at Francis Delafield Hospital; a trustee of Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital, Jackson Laboratories, and American Near East Refugee Aid; a regent of Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York; a member of the board of governors of the Middle East Institute, Washington; a member of the board of advisers of the Hariri Foundation USA; and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Born May 16, 1930, John was the eldest son of Helen (Fyke) and John R. Montgomery. John was the third generation in his family to live in Winnetka, Illinois.

In 1966, John left the Northern Trust Company to become the first president of a new bank, Lakeside Bank, on the near Southside of Chicago.

As he used to say, ""We opened the bank with 12 employees waiting for the first customers to come through the door."" Today, Lakeside Bank has six branches and over a billion dollars in assets. Throughout his business career, John Montgomery was active in civic endeavors. He was especially committed to developing the near Southside of Chicago, serving as Chairman and President of the Southside Planning Board for over 30 years. He was also President of the Banker's Club of Chicago, President of the Illinois Banker's Association, and President of the Cosmopolitan Chamber of Commerce. In addition, John was involved with his alma mater and many clubs, serving as President of the Williams Class of '52, President of the University Club of Chicago, and President of Hillsboro Club in Florida. He also served for a number of years as a trustee of the John G. Shedd Aquarium. When John retired from Lakeside Bank, he continued on as Vice Chairman, on the Board of Directors, and as a member of the executive committee for many years.

2015-11-15T00:00:00Z,"ARNOLD--Christopher C. April 14, 1963-October 30, 2015. Christopher Colver Arnold, age 52, beloved brother, devoted uncle, and friend to many, died Friday, October 30th in Southampton, NY. He was born and spent his early years in Chicago, where he attended the Latin School; later, he moved east and graduated from Phillips Academy Andover. After spending a year at Rugby School in Warwickshire, England, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Chris was an accomplished writer, composer, lyricist, event producer, photojournalist, art gallerist and collector. He dazzled with his knowledge - quoting Caesar in Latin, Homer in Greek or Shakespeare in rhyme-- and was the life of the party with his musicality, often playing the piano and singing his own parodies of Cole Porter tunes. Chris worked in public relations for many years with his close friend Ted Kruckel at Ted, Inc. He co-produced events for clients including Van Cleef & Arpels, Christian Dior, InStyle, and Vanity Fair. Throughout his life, Chris loved photography. A decades-long friendship with legendary photographer, Bert Stern, steered him to the art world, where he became associated with the Keszler Gallery in Southampton, a venue recognized for its local support of the artist Banksy, as documented in an HBO special. Chris was inspired by new artists and the challenge of unusual installations at Art Miami and Art Hamptons, including transporting the wall of a building adorned with a piece by Banksy. ""Moncle Chris"" will be missed by his nieces, nephews and their friends, who loved his magic tricks, ""marco polo"" in the pool, piano playing and card games. His family and all who knew him mourn the loss of a kind and sensitive man whose sense of style, mischievous wit and generous spirit brightened every room he entered. Chris is survived by his brothers Rome and Greg, their wives Lisa and Mona, and Rome IV. Contributions in his memory may be made to the Southampton Hospital Foundation (631-726-8700 ext. 3).

She was 91, born on January 24, 1924, in Warsaw, Poland to Isadore and Norma Slotnik. Mitzi was a great source of kindness, love, and strength for five generations of her family. Up until her last day, she worked as the office manager and bookkeeper for a medical practice in midtown Manhattan. She was a graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn. She was married and divorced twice, and her daughter Ronnie was the child of her first marriage to David Pollinger. Mitzi loved New York City and for more than the last thirty years lived on West 11th Street in the heart of Greenwich Village. She loved jazz, the Metropolitan Opera, fashion, Jewish family life, and collected friends at every opportunity. She had an addictive laugh; her ability to find the humor in life was remarkable. She enthusiastically welcomed family members and friends -- from Toronto to Jerusalem-- to stay with her on visits to New York. As the matriarch of her large extended family, she served as the central connection and information bank among numerous family members who imparted personal and professional updates, relying on Mitzi to disseminate the news. She was beloved for her passionate loyalty and devotion to her family, and was always proud of their accomplishments, but did not hesitate to give straightforward advice when warranted. She was trusted by all because she could keep a secret. She is survived by her loving daughter, Ronnie Barback and her husband Spencer; granddaughter, Rebecca Roban and her husband Ken; grandson, Michael Kanner and his wife Lisa; adoring four great-grandchildren, Danielle and Matthew Roban and Rex and Madison Kanner; three brothers, Jack Slotnick, and Fred and Sol Slotnik; and throngs of nieces and nephews.

2015-11-15T00:00:00Z,"GRAFF--Yveta Synek. Yveta Synek Graff, the self styled secret weapon of Czech Opera's Velvet Revolution passed away on Friday November 6th, 2015 at her home in Montecito, CA. Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Yveta Synek, was the only child of the distinguished judge, author, playwright, director, editor and politician Dr. Emil Synek and Eugenia Budlovska, a star of Czech theatre. A fervent anti-nazi working with the Czech government-in-exile, Dr. Synek anticipated the communist takeover in 1947 and managed to spirit his family to France. Yveta Synek flourished in Paris, studying voice with Ninon Vallin and modeling. She became ""Miss Kodak"" and appeared in promotional campaigns on billboards throughout France. In 1956 she obtained a coveted visa to go to America and never looked back. The young Synek arrived in New York City, met and married Robert Lincoln Love, a children's wear fashion designer and had two sons, Steve and Brett. Later on they would divorce and then she married F. Malcolm Graff, Jr., a private banker with the Bankers Trust Company. Their shared passion for opera brought them to the pinnacle of glamour in New York City, The Metropolitan Opera House. At the urging of her father and husband, she became the doyen of Czech Opera, first as a vocal coach in her native Czech language and then, with her colleague and editor Robert T. Jones, as a translator and transliterator (i.e. phonetic transcription). Today, her transliterations are permanently archived at the Juilliard School of Music and used by every opera house around the world. Yveta Graff's career started in 1977 with Eve Queler and the Opera Orchestra of New York performing Smetana's Dalibor, in Czech, on the stage of Carnegie Hall. For the next thirty years she worked at almost every opera house of note in the world overseeing productions of operas by Leos Janacek (The Cunning Little Vixen, Kat'a Kabanova, Jenufa, From the House of the Dead and The Makropulos Case), Dvorak (Rusalka) and Smetana (The Bartered Bride). Graff acted as right hand to such maestros as Rafael Kubelik, James Conlon and Sir. Charles Mackerras. She coached stars like Renee Fleming, Karita Mattila, Catherine Malfitano, Patricia Racette, Dolora Zajick, Gabriela Benackova and Ben Heppner. But of all her institutional associations, none was a greater source of pride to her than the one with The Metropolitan Opera, where she served as de facto subject-matter expert in all matters Czech for over two decades, beginning with Jenufa in 1985 and culminating with Rusalka in 2009. For her devotion to Czech Opera, Mrs. Graff received numerous medals from her native country including The Orders of the Czech Republic bestowed on her by the first democratically elected president of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel. Yveta Synek Graff is survived by her son, Steve Love, his wife, Jeanie Love, her grandson, Chase Love and her god-son, Marc Chazaud. 1/3"

She also served on the Museum's board of Trustees and as its President. She loved classical music, which led her to serve on the board of the Opera Theater of St. Louis.

She was a member of garden clubs in Hartford, St. Louis, Jupiter Island, and the Hortulus Garden Club in Greenwich, CT, of which her mother-in-law, Dorothy Walker Bush, was a member and her daughter Louisa is a member now. She was happiest when in a garden wearing her leather gloves, a trowel in her hand and mulch up to her ankles. She prided herself on knowing the Latin names for plants and their families. She received the Garden Clubs of America Medal of Merit for her extraordinary service to that organization. She also was a board member of the Center for Plant Conservation in St. Louis.

Clifford Heinz was born in Pittsburgh, PA on August 4, 1919. He believed and adhered to the principles of a life lived with honesty, generosity, compassion and unerring hard work. He was also known for his keen wit and often ironic sense of humor which he maintained until the end. Heinz was considered a magnanimous and benevolent philanthropist, having once written: ""I inherited from my grandfather, a consuming 'proprietorship ethic',"" to coin a phrase. As an entrepreneur he started a wide range of companies and was always confident about his ability to manage anything. Heinz's two favorite mottos were ""It can be done"" and ""Not if, but how."" He was known for sealing his deals with an old fashioned handshake which represented the veracity of a signed contract. He believed a good education was the greatest gift one could give a person, thus he established the Heinz Ethics Program at Polytechnic School in Pasadena, CA; the Clifford S. Heinz Ethical Education Endowment at the Webb School in Claremont; and a Chair for the Economics and Public Policy of Peace at the University of California, Irvine.

At the age of 15 he met his wife of 67 years, Frances S. Gebhardt, who predeceased him in 2011. After her death he remained in Manhattan in the apartment they shared for over 40 years. He loved (and was loved by) his friends, neighbors, building staff, and many local shopkeepers who were all invaluable to his quality of life.

He was greatly influenced by his time in the Army as a navigator during WWII on ""The Princess Pat,"" a B24 Liberator with the 458th Bomb Group. He was proud of his service, but sorry that so many innocents were killed. He returned home a pacifist. A 35 year teaching career at Wingate (Brooklyn), Bayside (Queens), and Assistant Principal of English at Fort Hamilton (Brooklyn) high schools earned him the respect of fellow staff and students alike. His influence was evident as many of his students became writers; and the teachers who worked with him remained in touch, long after retirement. He published a book on teaching Shakespeare, which was used in all New York City classrooms for years, and is in the Library of Congress. For Shakespeare's 400th birthday he made a ""cake"" out of wood with 400 candles. He was glad that he didn't burn anything down.

2015-11-16T00:00:00Z,"BUSH--Patricia Redfearn, passed away on November 10, 2015, at the age of 77. Patty was born in Greenville, SC, the daughter of Theron and Louisa Martin Redfearn. She attended St. Catherine's School and Bennett College before transferring to Vassar. In 1959 she married William H.T. Bush, the youngest of Sen. Prescott and Dorothy Bush's five children. She made homes for her family in New Haven, CT, Columbus, GA, Hartford and Greenwich, CT, London, England and ultimately St. Louis, MO. and Hobe Sound, FL. Her many civic accomplishments included working with Charles Cunningham to establish the first docent training program at Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford. She continued her studies in art history, and after moving to St. Louis served as a docent at the Art Museum there for more than 30 years. She also served on the Museum's board of Trustees and as its President. She loved classical music, which led her to serve on the board of the Opera Theater of St. Louis. Just as profound as her love of fine art was her devotion to plants. She was a member of garden clubs in Hartford, St. Louis, Jupiter Island, and the Hortulus Garden Club in Greenwich, CT, of which her mother-in-law, Dorothy Walker Bush, was a member and her daughter Louisa is a member now. She was happiest when in a garden wearing her leather gloves, a trowel in her hand and mulch up to her ankles. She prided herself on knowing the Latin names for plants and their families. She received the Garden Clubs of America Medal of Merit for her extraordinary service to that organization. She also was a board member of the Center for Plant Conservation in St. Louis. She is survived by her husband, children William Prescott Bush (Lindsay), of St. Louis, and Louisa B. McCall (Christian), of Greenwich, and five grandchildren: Katherine and Alexander Bush, and Henry, William, and Lucinda McCall.

He also served for a number of years as a trustee of the John G. Shedd Aquarium.

John was husband to Elizabeth Graham Montgomery and the late Dorothy ""DeeDee"" Smart Montgomery; father to John Montgomery (Lynne), DeeDee Myers (David), and Sally Jones (Ken); stepfather to William Graham and Melinda Graham; grandfather to Mari, Johnny, Jennifer, DeeDee, David, Sally, Brantner, Stephen, and Sarah; step-grandfather to Laila, Olivia, and Elizabeth; and brother to William Montgomery.

2015-11-18T00:00:00Z,"GEBHARDT--John C.,90, died Sunday, October 18th, 2015 in Cortland, NY. He was born in Brooklyn, NY on February 19th, 1925 where he grew up. At the age of 15 he met his wife of 67 years, Frances S. Gebhardt, who predeceased him in 2011. After her death he remained in Manhattan in the apartment they shared for over 40 years. He loved (and was loved by) his friends, neighbors, building staff, and many local shopkeepers who were all invaluable to his quality of life. He wanted all to know that the most important thing in his life was his family. He felt fortunate to be with them in his final days. He is survived by his daughter Claudia (Syracuse), son Jeff and his wife Gonda (Cortland), seven grandchildren - Dana (Stefan Jakowenko), Lynn (Colin McEvoy), Aiyana, Taimah, Naomi, Maya, and Kaylee, two great-grandchildren Connor and Alexa, and his sister Anna Mae Watson (Plainview). He was greatly influenced by his time in the Army as a navigator during WWII on ""The Princess Pat,"" a B24 Liberator with the 458th Bomb Group. He was proud of his service, but sorry that so many innocents were killed. He returned home a pacifist. A 35 year teaching career at Wingate (Brooklyn), Bayside (Queens), and Assistant Principal of English at Fort Hamilton (Brooklyn) high schools earned him the respect of fellow staff and students alike. His influence was evident as many of his students became writers; and the teachers who worked with him remained in touch, long after retirement. He published a book on teaching Shakespeare, which was used in all New York City classrooms for years, and is in the Library of Congress. For Shakespeare's 400th birthday he made a ""cake"" out of wood with 400 candles. He was glad that he didn't burn anything down. He was grateful to the many people who were so kind to him, especially after his wife, Fran, died. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends, and all who knew him. Calling hours will be from 1:00-2:15pm on Saturday, November 21st at the Andrett Funeral Home, 353 Second Avenue, in New York City. A celebration of John's life will follow at 2:30pm. 1/3"

2015-11-18T00:00:00Z,"CURRY--Beth Rivers, died peacefully at home in Manhattan on Monday, surrounded by her family. Raised on a farm in Chesterfield, SC, the first of five children, she grew up feeding chickens and exploring the hills nearby. She attended Queens College in Charlotte, graduating as student body president and valedictorian. Beth married, raised her family, and then, when her children were older, returned to Queens for business school. Soon after, she co-founded Eagle Capital Management in New York, now a $25 billion investment firm, which manages money for families, universities, foundations, and pension funds. Even as she helped build a large investment firm and sat on the boards of many institutions, Beth remained true to her South Carolina values. Eschewing the combative, confrontational style of high finance, she brought a purposeful, friendly, common-sense skepticism to Wall Street. Her disarming southern accent and small stature masked a probing, persistent, analytic intelligence. She had a wide, warm and genuine curiosity of everyone she met--from CEOs to cab drivers to strangers' children--and took as much pleasure stumbling upon a strange mushroom or beautiful moss growing in the woods as discovering new investment opportunities. Her sensitivity to every individual helped the Eagle staff challenge each other without fracture for 27 years in an industry sometimes characterized by short-term relationships and rapid turnover. Beth sometimes regretted not being a scientist and later in life took great pleasure in spending time with researchers at Weill Cornell Medical College and Rockefeller University, on whose boards she served. She was grateful to Queens for helping her make the transition from homemaker to financial executive; she served as a trustee of the college, starting in 1986 and received their Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award in 2008. In 1995 she joined the board of the Hyde and Watson Foundation, providing capital to hundreds of arts, education, healthcare, and social service organizations. Church community has always been an important part of Beth's life, and most recently she was a trustee at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. Before entering the workforce, she was a devoted community volunteer who helped build the Summit Childcare Center, New Jersey's first modern infant care and pre-K facility for working mothers. Above all, Beth was a great storyteller and wit, inherited from her father and cultivated in a large Southern farm family. She could transfix friends and family by turning some small forgettable moment into an unforgettable yarn. She is survived by her husband of 52 years, Ravenel Boykin Curry III, who was also her business partner for 27 years; her three children, Ravenel Boykin Curry IV, Caroline Rivers Curry (Rob Davis), and Marshall Anderson Curry (Elizabeth Martin); her seven grandchildren, Ravenel V, Zinnia, Wick, Jackson, Quinton, Jane and Rivers; and her siblings, Jay Rivers (Cathryn), Rebecca Sullivan (Burr) and Melinda Ford (Tommy). She was predeceased by her sister Carolyn Query. A memorial service will be held on Monday, November 23 at 11:15am at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church with a reception to follow. In lieu of flowers, gifts can be made to: Weill Cornell Medicine; The Rockefeller University; or Queens University of Charlotte. 1/3"

Beth had a deep curiosity about science and a passion for learning about the work of our investigators. Our scientists treasured their friendships with Beth and relished her delight in discovery. A friend of the University since the 1990s, Beth Curry joined The Rockefeller University Council in 2008 and was elected to the Board of Trustees in 2013, serving on a number of Board committees, including Finance & Operations, Hospital, and Audit.

With her husband, Rockefeller University Council member Ravenel Boykin Curry III, Beth provided generous support that touched many facets of life at the University. A cofounder with Ravenel of Eagle Capital Management, Beth was an astute investor and a talented fund manager who contributed enormously to the firm's success.

Flickinger of East Amherst, NY, and four children: Wendy Ross, of Katonah, NY, Geoffrey Flickinger of North Kingstown, RI, Thomas Flickinger of Winnetka, IL, Holly Williams of Durham, NC, and 13 grandchildren. Born in Buffalo, NY on July 11, 1932 to Glenn and Awdry Flickinger, Tom attended Nichols School and graduated from Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, NH in 1950 and Harvard University in 1954.

2015-11-19T00:00:00Z,"ZUMOFF--Selma, (nee Silver) was born on February 28, 1928, and died on November 17, 2015. She was educated in the New York City public and high schools and graduated from Brooklyn College. She married Barnett Zumoff on November 11, 1951.

2015-11-19T00:00:00Z,"COWAN--Louise. Louise Cowan, university teacher and nationally recognized leader in humanities education, passed away Monday, November 16, in Dallas. She was 98. Dr. Cowan taught for fifty-three years at the University of Dallas, where she was chair of the English department, dean of graduate studies, University Professor, and the first occupant of the Louise Cowan Chair in Humanities. With her husband Donald Cowan, physicist and president of the university from 1962 to 1977, she worked steadily to build an internationally recognized university with a core curriculum based in the Western classics. She and political philosopher Willmoore Kendall founded the university's Institute of Philosophic Studies, a unique combination of doctoral programs in disciplines centered on the study of core texts, and she directed its growth. The dual focus of Dr. Cowan's life--on building the good city and educating to the fullest all the members of that city was expressed in her founding, along with her husband and four other intellectual leaders, the Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture in 1980 to bring the life of the mind into dialogue with the city. She then conceived of and initiated the Teachers Academy at the institute in 1983, a program for Dallas public school teachers that from 1984-87 was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, which cited it as a ""model for the nation."" In July 2015 the Teachers Academy, which is now part of the larger Cowan Center for Education, conducted its 32nd consecutive Summer Institute for Teachers. For her work with this institute and her other contributions to the teaching of the classics, she received the Arete Award from the city of Dallas in 1965; the Dallas Historical Society's Award in the Humanities in 1980, and in 1991 the Charles Frankel Prize (now the National Humanities Award), the nation's highest award for work in the humanities, awarded in the White House. In 2010 she was named one of two women on the list of the 20 most brilliant living Christian professors. Born in Fort Worth, Dr. Cowan received her B.A. and M.A. from Texas Christian University and her Ph.D. in 1953 from Vanderbilt University, where she wrote her dissertation on the group of Southern poets and critics who dominated the national literary scene for several decades. She was widely recognized for the book published from her dissertation, The Fugitive Group, still considered an indispensable document for understanding the Southern Renascence that began in the 1920s. She was author also of The Southern Critics and editor of, among other volumes, Invitation to the Classics (with Os Guinness), Classic Texts and the Nature of Authority (with Donald Cowan), and The Terrain of Comedy, and general editor of the series The Genres of Literature. She was acclaimed as a teacher throughout the country and noted for her teaching of Shakespearean tragedy and comedy and twentieth- century Southern literature, as well as the novels of Dostoevsky, Faulkner, and Caroline Gordon. In 2014 she spoke on Southern culture at the University of the South upon being awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters. She continued her work in teaching and lecturing through her 99th year, presenting her last lecture, on the vocation of teaching, two months ago. Her belief was that great literature (Homer, Virgil, Aeschylus, Dante, Shakespeare) is the birthright of every American and that, as an integral part of democracy's very foundation, it provides an education necessary for all. In all, Louise Cowan's life and work in literature and teaching constituted an original, abiding contribution to American culture. She was preceded in death by her husband Donald, parents Will and Ouita Shillingburg, sister Doris Shillingburg, granddaughter Lucy, and granddaughter-in-law Aimee. She is survived by her son Bainard and his wife, Christine; grandchildren Claire Barbetti, Will, Donald, Elizabeth Wells, Michael, Veronica Phair, and Glencora Pipkin; twelve great-grandchildren; and thousands of students whose minds and hearts she won. Services will be at Christ the King Catholic Church, Dallas. In lieu of flowers, she wished that contributions be made to the Donald and Louise Cowan Scholarship Fund of the Braniff Graduate School, University of Dallas.

2015-11-19T00:00:00Z,"CURRY--Elizabeth (Beth) Rivers, died peacefully at home in Manhattan on Monday, surrounded by her family. Raised on a farm in Chesterfield, SC, the first of five children, she grew up feeding chickens and exploring the hills nearby. She attended Queens College in Charlotte, graduating as student body president and valedictorian. Beth married, raised her family, and then, when her children were older, returned to Queens for business school. Soon after, she co- founded Eagle Capital Management in New York, now a $25 billion investment firm, which manages money for families, universities, foundations, and pension funds. Even as she helped build a large firm and sat on the boards of many institutions, Beth remained true to her South Carolina values. Eschewing the combative, confrontational style of high finance, she brought a purposeful, friendly, common- sense skepticism to Wall Street. Her disarming southern accent and small stature masked a probing, persistent, analytic intelligence. She had a wide, warm and genuine curiosity about everyone she met--from CEOs to cab drivers to strangers' children-- and took as much pleasure stumbling upon a strange mushroom or beautiful moss growing in the woods as discovering new investment opportunities. Her sensitivity to every individual helped the Eagle staff challenge each other without fracture for 27 years in an industry often characterized by short-term relationships and rapid turnover. Beth sometimes regretted not being a scientist and later in life enjoyed spending time with researchers at Weill Cornell Medical College and Rockefeller University, on whose boards she served. She was grateful to Queens for helping her make the transition from homemaker to financial executive; she served as a trustee of the college, starting in 1986 and received their Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award in 2008. In 1995 she joined the board of the Hyde and Watson Foundation, providing capital to hundreds of arts, education, healthcare, and social service organizations. Church community has always been an important part of Beth's life, and most recently she was a trustee at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. Before entering the workforce, she was a devoted community volunteer who helped build the Summit Childcare Center, New Jersey's first modern infant care and pre-K facility for working mothers. Above all, Beth was a great storyteller and wit, inherited from her father and cultivated in a large Southern farm family. She could transfix friends and family by turning some small forgettable moment into an unforgettable yarn. She is survived by her husband of 52 years, Ravenel Boykin Curry III, who was also her business partner for 27 years; her three children, Ravenel Boykin Curry IV, Caroline Rivers Curry (Rob Davis), and Marshall Anderson Curry (Elizabeth Martin); her seven grandchildren, Ravenel V, Zinnia, Wick, Jackson, Quinton, Jane and Rivers; and her siblings, Jay Rivers (Cathryn), Rebecca Sullivan (Burr) and Melinda Ford (Tommy). She was predeceased by her sister Carolyn Query. A memorial service will be held on Monday, November 23 at 11:15am at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church with a reception to follow.

2015-11-19T00:00:00Z,"BRUNO--Michael S.,M.D. 93, died on November 16, 2015 in Manhattan. For 35 years Dr. Bruno was Director of the Department of Medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital (""LHH""). He was elected to four terms as President of the Medical Board, a member of the Board of Trustees and Joint Conference Committee for 24 years, and a member of the Lenox Hill Corporation. In addition he was regarded as one of the best diagnosticians in New York while he carried out his private practice as an internist. Dr. Bruno also served as Lenox Hill's Associate Dean for Medical Education for the NYU Medical Center affiliation, a position that continued his role as a mentor and guide to future generations of physicians. When he arrived at LHH in 1966, it was regarded as a community hospital. Over the years, Dr. Bruno's passion for graduate medical education made it into one of the finest programs in New York City. His leadership was instrumental in transforming LHH to an outstanding teaching hospital and tertiary care center. This helped foster many important innovations and improvements in patient care. One example of this took place in 1978 when Dr. Bruno gave approval for Dr. Simon Stertzer to perform what was the first balloon angioplasty in the United States; he also gave him the support, encouragement and resources to develop the program, which revolutionized the care of patients with heart disease throughout the world. A native of New York City, Dr. Bruno earned his BA and MD degrees from Columbia College and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons respectively. After an internship at Bellevue Hospital and service in the U.S. Army in Japan, he was discharged as Captain in 1948 and appointed Chief Resident at Bellevue Hospital with additional, significant teaching and administrative responsibilities. In 1956 at the age of 34, he became Director of the Department of Medicine at Knickerbocker Hospital in Harlem, serving as President of its Medical Board and a member of the Medical Board Executive Committee. Dr. Bruno was predeceased by his loving wife, Ida Marion Bruno in 2002, and by his brother Gregory and sister Lilian. He is survived by his loving partner, Maria Goode Schwartz, his children: Lauretta Bruno, Pamela (Charlie) Williams, Michael (Meg) Bruno, his four grandchildren: Geoff (Keridy) Williams, Mike Bruno, Russell (Spencer) Bruno and Price Bruno, and one great-grandchild: Hudson Williams. Family and friends may visit Friday, November 20 from 2-4pm, or 7-9pm at Barrett Funeral Home, 148 Dean Drive, Tenafly, NJ. A Funeral Mass will be celebrated on Saturday, November 21 at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, 10 County Road, Tenafly, NJ at 9:30am.

2015-11-19T00:00:00Z,"CURRY--Elizabeth Rivers. The trustees, faculty, staff and students of The Rockefeller University deeply mourn the loss of our cherished trustee Elizabeth Rivers Curry. Beth had a deep curiosity about science and a passion for learning about the work of our investigators. Our scientists treasured their friendships with Beth and relished her delight in discovery. A friend of the University since the 1990s, Beth Curry joined The Rockefeller University Council in 2008 and was elected to the Board of Trustees in 2013, serving on a number of Board committees, including Finance & Operations, Hospital, and Audit. Beth's thoughtful and deeply engaged participation in the work of these committees and her dedication to advancing scientific research greatly strengthened the University. With her husband, Rockefeller University Council member Ravenel Boykin Curry III, Beth provided generous support that touched many facets of life at the University. A cofounder with Ravenel of Eagle Capital Management, Beth was an astute investor and a talented fund manager who contributed enormously to the firm's success. Like her husband and children, Beth shared the fruits of this success through a commitment to philanthropy and pro bono work. One of the kindest, warmest, most gracious people in the University's orbit, Beth added much to the culture and community at Rockefeller. She will be profoundly missed by all of us whose lives she touched. We send our heartfelt condolences to Beth's beloved husband, Ravenel; her three children, Boykin, Caroline, and Marshall, and their spouses; her adored grandchildren; and her entire family.

Born June 23, 1937 in Greenwich Village, he was the eldest child of Italian immigrants; his father Angelo Zuccotti was the longtime maitre d' at the El Morocco. John attended St. Joseph's Academy on Washington Square Park and La Salle Military Academy in Oakdale, Long Island, followed by Princeton University. He served as an officer in the U.S. Army and then graduated from Yale Law School in 1962. During a summer internship in the office of Senator Jacob Javits, John met Susan Sessions; they married in 1963 and remained devoted for 52 years. John's long professional life began in Venezuela, where he served as an urban planning consultant, and in Washington DC, where he worked for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 1970, John and Susan moved to the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, where they have lived ever since. John worked under Mayor John Lindsay as a commissioner for the New York City Planning Commission and later as its chairman.

2015-11-22T00:00:00Z,"CARRINGTON--Kathleen. Kathleen Connell Carrington, 88, passed away peacefully on November 7, 2015 in Greenville, South Carolina. Kay, as she was known by her friends and family, was a steadfast and loving wife and mother. Born January 11, 1927 in Jersey City, New Jersey to John Norman Connell and Helen Burke Connell, Kay was one of nine children. Beautiful and unassuming, with an easy sense of humor and disarming smile, Kay graduated from Notre Dame College in Baltimore soon after the Second World War. Shortly thereafter she married Jim Carrington, a three-sport All-American, at the U.S. Naval Academy. In what has been described as a fairytale wedding, the midshipmen in their dress-whites rained rice upon the stunningly beautiful newlyweds as they ran beneath a shining arc of crossed sabers. Kay taught school until the arrival of the first of her five children, whom she raised in or near seaports around the world, from Yokosuka, Japan to Annapolis, Maryland. Like most Navy wives, while her husband was away at sea, often for months at a time, she stoically ran the householdwithout ever a complaint. Kay and Jim taught their children a great deal, but perhaps their most precious legacy was setting an example of how wonderful a marriage can be. As irony would have it, in the precise moment of Kay's sudden passing, all her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren were gathered together in California for the marriage of her grandson Michael. The thought would have pleased her to no end. Kay is survived by her daughters, Wendy Carrington, Nancy (Steve) Crown, and Kathleen (Steven) Anderson; sons, James Carrington, Jr., and Timothy (Cathleen) Carrington; sisters, Shelly Cullen, Madeleine Reilly, Elizabeth De Souza; brother, James Connell; ten grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews. She was preceded in death by her parents; husband James H.H. Carrington; sisters, Elise Leahy, Mary Lou Towey, and Nancy Bockus; brother, Jack Connell; and daughter-in-law Antonella Murgia Carrington.

Born August 23, 1957, in Englewood, New Jersey, Lori was a loving mother to sons Eric and Daniel, while leading a distinguished career in the field of psychiatry. Lori received her B.A. and M.D. degrees from Cornell University, and completed a fellowship in biological psychiatry at the National Institute of Mental Health. At NIMH, Lori began pioneering work in magnetic resonance imaging to assess changes in the brain of patients with psychiatric disorders. Lori joined the UCLA faculty in 1989, was appointed chief of the bipolar disorders clinic at Brentwood VA in 1991, and in 1995 established the UCLA Mood Disorders Research Program. In 2004, Lori was honored with the Julia S. Gouw Endowed Chair in Mood Disorders at UCLA. Over more than 30 years, Lori advanced the understanding of fundamental mechanisms of mood dysregulation with innovative research; shared her findings extensively in research papers and talks; and took an active interest in mentoring the next generation of researchers. She received 58 grants, including 11 major research grants from NIMH and 3 from the Department of Veteran Affairs; published more than 265 articles in peer-reviewed journals; authored 23 chapters in scholarly texts; and presented more than 50 major addresses at research conferences worldwide. Lori's professional accomplishments were well recognized. She was named a Distinguished Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association in 1997, and received The 2014 Award for Research in Mood Disorders from the American College of Psychiatrists. In between she received many other awards including the Southern California Psychiatric Society's 2008 Award for Outstanding Achievement and the 2006 Falcone Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Affective Disorders Research. Her peers acknowledged her clinical acumen by electing her to the ""Best Doctors in America"" seven times. Reflecting her deep commitment to mentoring young physicians, Lori especially prized the teaching and mentoring awards she received. For all her professional achievements, Lori's family provided her greatest joy. Raised in a close-knit family that was a source of laughter and strength, she created the same loving environment for her boys and passed on those strong family ties. Lori also cherished many deep friendships, no doubt borne from her affability and innate empathy. Indeed, to know her was to love her. In addition to sons Eric and Daniel, Lori is survived by her parents, Gloria Altshuler (the late Leonard Elberger) and Dr. Kenneth (Ruth) Altshuler; husband Greg Monfette and step-daughter Jaime Monfette; siblings Dr. Steven (Terry) Altshuler and Dara (Robert Kaplan) Altshuler; and numerous adoring nieces, nephews, cousins, and countless friends and colleagues.

2015-11-22T00:00:00Z,"CURRY--Elizabeth (Beth) Rivers, died peacefully at home in Manhattan on Monday, surrounded by her family. Raised on a farm in Chesterfield, SC, the first of five children, she grew up feeding chickens and exploring the hills nearby. She attended Queens College in Charlotte, graduating as student body president and valedictorian. Beth married, raised her family, and then, when her children were older, returned to Queens for business school. Soon after, she co- founded Eagle Capital Management in New York, now a $25 billion investment firm, which manages money for families, universities, foundations, and pension funds. Even as she helped build a large firm and sat on the boards of many institutions, Beth remained true to her South Carolina values. Eschewing the combative, confrontational style of high finance, she brought a purposeful, friendly, common- sense skepticism to Wall Street. Her disarming southern accent and small stature masked a probing, persistent, analytic intelligence. She had a wide, warm and genuine curiosity about everyone she met--from CEOs to cab drivers to strangers' children-- and took as much pleasure stumbling upon a strange mushroom or beautiful moss growing in the woods as discovering new investment opportunities. Her sensitivity to every individual helped the Eagle staff challenge each other without fracture for 27 years in an industry often characterized by short-term relationships and rapid turnover. Beth sometimes regretted not being a scientist and later in life enjoyed spending time with researchers at Weill Cornell Medical College and Rockefeller University, on whose boards she served. She was grateful to Queens for helping her make the transition from homemaker to financial executive; she served as a trustee of the college, starting in 1986 and received their Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award in 2008. In 1995 she joined the board of the Hyde and Watson Foundation, providing capital to hundreds of arts, education, healthcare, and social service organizations. Church community has always been an important part of Beth's life, and most recently she was a trustee at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. Before entering the workforce, she was a devoted community volunteer who helped build the Summit Childcare Center, New Jersey's first modern infant care and pre-K facility for working mothers. Above all, Beth was a great storyteller and wit, inherited from her father and cultivated in a large Southern farm family. She could transfix friends and family by turning some small forgettable moment into an unforgettable yarn. She is survived by her husband of 52 years, Ravenel Boykin Curry III, who was also her business partner for 27 years; her three children, Ravenel Boykin Curry IV, Caroline Rivers Curry (Rob Davis), and Marshall Anderson Curry (Elizabeth Martin); her seven grandchildren, Ravenel V, Zinnia, Wick, Jackson, Quinton, Jane and Rivers; and her siblings, Jay Rivers (Cathryn), Rebecca Sullivan (Burr) and Melinda Ford (Tommy). She was predeceased by her sister Carolyn Query. A memorial service will be held on Monday, November 23 at 11:15am at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church with a reception to follow.

2015-11-22T00:00:00Z,"ZUCCOTTI--John. Our firm - Weil, Gotshal & Manges - grieves the loss of John Zuccotti, Senior Counsel in our Real Estate practice. John was larger than life in so many respects which will be recounted for years to come in many places by the vast range of people whose lives he's touched. Here we recount a personal relationship which transcends that. John came to our firm through the long time efforts of our senior partner Ira Millstein, who had wooed him for years. John and Ira were close friends dating back to the fiscal crisis of the 1970s when John was the Deputy Mayor under Abraham Beame, in effect running the City during one of its most difficult times. Ira was his pro bono counsel and together they weathered the cross currents of bankers, unions, politics, law and many different personalities. They came to trust each other completely - they had to. From there they remained in close touch with Italian dinners in Little Italy, meetings with countless different people, and most importantly through their families. John was a very loving husband to his wife Susan and a wonderful and attentive father and grandfather. Over many years, Ira and John became each other's confidants and reliable source for advice. Finally, Ira convinced John to join Weil in 1997. Probably John would not appreciate this, but to Ira and all of us at Weil, John personified the golden rule which underlies all religions and ethics. He knew right from wrong and how to execute that. He brought that DNA to everything he was involved in, most importantly and currently to our partners and associates at Weil who sought his advice, for which he was always available. We will miss his presence and guidance deeply. And we feel for his family, to which he was so devoted. 1/3"

His conversation was filled with asides that could honor the innovation of a Slant Six engine, the precise color of Egyptian papyrus grass or the simple beauty of a farmhouse staircase. He was fun to listen to but also an empathetic listener. He revitalized four homes near the St. Lawrence River in Canada, one that had been in the family for generations and another that became the Van Allen Archives, a resource and library for the community and surrounding universities. His unique intelligence and humor was influential in the lives of colleagues, friends and family. Traer will be greatly missed but remembered with love and deep appreciation for his life. Traer is survived by his sister, Louise Van Allen Tarleton (Hillsborough, CA); her daughters, Leslie Hayne (Oakland, CA), Courtney Hayne McDowell (Brooklyn, NY); nephews, nieces, Godchildren and a wide range of friends. 1/3"

2015-11-23T00:00:00Z,"ZUCCOTTI--John. Our firm - Weil, Gotshal & Manges - grieves the loss of John Zuccotti, Senior Counsel in our Real Estate practice. John was larger than life in so many respects which will be recounted for years to come in many places by the vast range of people whose lives he's touched. Here we recount a personal relationship which transcends that. John came to our firm through the long time efforts of our senior partner Ira Millstein, who had wooed him for years. John and Ira were close friends dating back to the fiscal crisis of the 1970s when John was the Deputy Mayor under Abraham Beame, in effect running the City during one of its most difficult times. Ira was his pro bono counsel and together they weathered the cross currents of bankers, unions, politics, law and many different personalities. They came to trust each other completely - they had to. From there they remained in close touch with Italian dinners in Little Italy, meetings with countless different people, and most importantly through their families. John was a very loving husband to his wife Susan and a wonderful and attentive father and grandfather. Over many years, Ira and John became each other's confidants and reliable source for advice. Finally, Ira convinced John to join Weil in 1997. Probably John would not appreciate this, but to Ira and all of us at Weil, John personified the golden rule which underlies all religions and ethics. He knew right from wrong and how to execute that. He brought that DNA to everything he was involved in, most importantly and currently to our partners and associates at Weil who sought his advice, for which he was always available. We will miss his presence and guidance deeply. And we feel for his family, to which he was so devoted. 1/3"

2015-11-23T00:00:00Z,"ROSEN--Matthew A.,of Manhattan and Quogue, NY passed away peacefully on November 20, 2015 after a courageous battle with pancreatic cancer. A native of South Philadelphia, Matthew graduated from Swarthmore College (1973), Boston University Law School (1976) and New York University Law School (LLM, 1979). In 1979, he joined Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, where he would go on to serve as co-head of the Tax Practice for over 25 years. Matthew was known in legal and business circles for his brilliant analytic mind, his ability to solve complex legal problems and to deconstruct complicated tax analysis. Both Chambers Global and Chambers USA repeatedly named Matthew in their top tier of lawyers, and he was listed in Euromoney's Guide to the World's Leading Tax Lawyers numerous times. He was named Best Lawyers' ""2013 New York City Tax Lawyer of the Year,"" and Legal 500 U.S. Portfolio magazine included him in its list of the top 10 tax attorneys in the United States. Matthew took immense joy in his work, but he also had an abiding passion for books, music, film and art. He was particularly committed to bringing great theater to all audiences and served on the Board of Playwrights Horizons. His mind was always active, his intellect broad and deep, his wit clever and mischievous, but his heart was always with his family to whom he was profoundly devoted and whom he always loved and supported. He is survived by his children Amanda (25), Oliver (20) and Anthony (1), his wife Mariana, and his brother Kenny. We will miss him dearly. There will be a celebration of Matthew's life at 1pm on Monday, November 23, 2015 at Central Synagogue, 652 Lexington Avenue, NYC. 1/3"

2015-11-23T00:00:00Z,"CARRINGTON--Kathleen. Kathleen Connell Carrington, 88, passed away peacefully on November 7, 2015 in Greenville, South Carolina. Kay, as she was known by her friends and family, was a steadfast and loving wife and mother. Born January 11, 1927 in Jersey City, New Jersey to John Norman Connell and Helen Burke Connell, Kay was one of nine children. Beautiful and unassuming, with an easy sense of humor and disarming smile, Kay graduated from Notre Dame College in Baltimore soon after the Second World War. Shortly thereafter she married Jim Carrington, a three-sport All-American, at the U.S. Naval Academy. In what has been described as a fairytale wedding, the midshipmen in their dress-whites rained rice upon the stunningly beautiful newlyweds as they ran beneath a shining arc of crossed sabers. Kay taught school until the arrival of the first of her five children, whom she raised in or near seaports around the world, from Yokosuka, Japan to Annapolis, Maryland. Like most Navy wives, while her husband was away at sea, often for months at a time, she stoically ran the householdwithout ever a complaint. Kay and Jim taught their children a great deal, but perhaps their most precious legacy was setting an example of how wonderful a marriage can be. As irony would have it, in the precise moment of Kay's sudden passing, all her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren were gathered together in California for the marriage of her grandson Michael. The thought would have pleased her to no end. Kay is survived by her daughters, Wendy Carrington, Nancy (Steve) Crown, and Kathleen (Steven) Anderson; sons, James Carrington, Jr., and Timothy (Cathleen) Carrington; sisters, Shelly Cullen, Madeleine Reilly, Elizabeth De Souza; brother, James Connell; ten grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews. She was preceded in death by her parents; husband James H.H. Carrington; sisters, Elise Leahy, Mary Lou Towey, and Nancy Bockus; brother, Jack Connell; and daughter-in-law Antonella Murgia Carrington. A service celebrating Kay's life is being planned for the spring of 2016. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Rheumatology Research Foundation, 2200 Lake Boulevard NE, Atlanta, GA 30319 or www.rheumresearch.org. 1/3"

A co-head of our tax practice, Matthew was a rare kind of lawyer -- one of the very finest tax practitioners of his generation and an unsurpassed mentor of the generations growing up under him. He led by example and will be remembered as always supporting new talent and the expansion of the practice into new spheres. Matthew joined our New York tax team in 1979 and, building upon the culture of camaraderie he inherited, enhanced the tightly knit group's reputation exponentially. Matthew handled every aspect of tax work and developed various types of financial instruments. He was repeatedly ranked among the top practitioners of his field. Raised in South Philly, Matthew attended Swarthmore College ('73) and Boston University School of Law ('76) and received an LLM from New York University School of Law ('79). He is survived by his wife, Mariana, and his children, Amanda, Anthony and Oliver. He will be missed greatly by all of us. 1/3"

2015-11-24T00:00:00Z,"ZUCCOTTI--John. Our firm - Weil, Gotshal & Manges - grieves the loss of John Zuccotti, Senior Counsel in our Real Estate practice. John was larger than life in so many respects which will be recounted for years to come in many places by the vast range of people whose lives he's touched. Here we recount a personal relationship which transcends that. John came to our firm through the long time efforts of our senior partner Ira Millstein, who had wooed him for years. John and Ira were close friends dating back to the fiscal crisis of the 1970s when John was the Deputy Mayor under Abraham Beame, in effect running the City during one of its most difficult times. Ira was his pro bono counsel and together they weathered the cross currents of bankers, unions, politics, law and many different personalities. They came to trust each other completely - they had to. From there they remained in close touch with Italian dinners in Little Italy, meetings with countless different people, and most importantly through their families. John was a very loving husband to his wife Susan and a wonderful and attentive father and grandfather. Over many years, Ira and John became each other's confidants and reliable source for advice. Finally, Ira convinced John to join Weil in 1997. Probably John would not appreciate this, but to Ira and all of us at Weil, John personified the golden rule which underlies all religions and ethics. He knew right from wrong and how to execute that. He brought that DNA to everything he was involved in, most importantly and currently to our partners and associates at Weil who sought his advice, for which he was always available. We will miss his presence and guidance deeply. And we feel for his family, to which he was so devoted. 1/3"

2015-11-25T00:00:00Z,"TURNER--William Ian Mackenzie, Jr. William ""Bill"" Turner died peacefully on November 20th. He had battled declining health for several years. Bill had a very distinguished business career. He moved to Montreal in 1954 and worked for Ingersoll-Rand for nine years. After five years as President of Power Corporation, he led Consolidated-Bathurst for two decades before ""retiring"" to his private office eyrie in Place Ville Marie. He also served on numerous boards of major Canadian and international corporations. Bill was born in Sharon, PA. Shortly thereafter, the family returned to Toronto where Bill earned a degree in Engineering from the University of Toronto. At Harvard Business School, he met his first wife, Ann (deceased). He is survived by their four children: Bill (Barbara), Julia (Peter), Jamie (Martha) and Carol (Gerard), eleven grandchildren, his brother Peter, and three nephews. In 1989, Bill married Nancy Gray and became an active stepfather to Lisa (Alan), Susan, Andy (Larcia) and a caring step- grandfather to their ten children. Bill had many keen interests beyond business. He was exceptionally proud of Bishop's University where he served as Chancellor 1987-1995. He was an active supporter and promoter of the arts, particularly the Stratford Festival and Canada Council's Musical Instrument Bank. Bill led a major fundraising campaign in the 1980's for the Royal Victoria Hospital and was invested into the Order of Canada in 1987. He travelled to all corners of the globe but still liked nothing more than going to cheer on the Canadiens and the Expos. He was a bon vivant, a raconteur, a connoisseur of Montreal's restaurant scene, and a gracious and generous host. Perhaps his greatest legacy was his ability to demand and inspire high standards, particularly in education, and still treat everyone with decency and respect. A memorial service will take place at 1pm on Saturday, November 28th at Christ Church Cathedral, 635 St. Catherine St. West in Montreal, Quebec. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to the Stratford Festival, www.stratfordfestival.ca. 1/3"

2015-11-26T00:00:00Z,"TURNER--William Ian Mackenzie, Jr. William ""Bill"" Turner died peacefully on November 20th. He had battled declining health for several years. Bill had a very distinguished business career. He moved to Montreal in 1954 and worked for Ingersoll-Rand for nine years. After five years as President of Power Corporation, he led Consolidated-Bathurst for two decades before ""retiring"" to his private office eyrie in Place Ville Marie. He also served on numerous boards of major Canadian and international corporations. Bill was born in Sharon, PA. Shortly thereafter, the family returned to Toronto where Bill earned a degree in Engineering from the University of Toronto. At Harvard Business School, he met his first wife, Ann (deceased). He is survived by their four children: Bill (Barbara), Julia (Peter), Jamie (Martha) and Carol (Gerard), eleven grandchildren, his brother Peter, and three nephews. In 1989, Bill married Nancy Gray and became an active stepfather to Lisa (Alan), Susan, Andy (Larcia) and a caring step- grandfather to their ten children. Bill had many keen interests beyond business. He was exceptionally proud of Bishop's University where he served as Chancellor 1987-1995. He was an active supporter and promoter of the arts, particularly the Stratford Festival and Canada Council's Musical Instrument Bank. Bill led a major fundraising campaign in the 1980's for the Royal Victoria Hospital and was invested into the Order of Canada in 1987. He travelled to all corners of the globe but still liked nothing more than going to cheer on the Canadiens and the Expos. He was a bon vivant, a raconteur, a connoisseur of Montreal's restaurant scene, and a gracious and generous host. Perhaps his greatest legacy was his ability to demand and inspire high standards, particularly in education, and still treat everyone with decency and respect. A memorial service will take place at 1pm on Saturday, November 28th at Christ Church Cathedral, 635 St. Catherine St. West in Montreal, Quebec. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to the Stratford Festival, www.stratfordfestival.ca. 1/3"

Nondita Mason, a retired professor of postcolonial literature and theory at Hunter College, died on September 25 at her Manhattan apartment, one day after returning from a 23-day trip to Italy, Greece, and Turkey with her husband, Bryant Mason. They climbed the Acropolis to see the Parthenon in Athens; cruised the Aegean to Santorini, Rhodes, Patmos, Mykonos, and Limnos; heard classical music at an illuminated Greek amphitheater at Ephesus in Turkey; toured Istanbul, and visited the Coliseum and the Vatican among other historic sites. Ms. Mason was most happy to have her Brooklyn nephew, Indro Chaudhury Sartorio, join her in Rome. The cause was long-term complications of bronchiectasis, a disease for which there is no cure. ""After 15 years of suffering with this disease, she simply ran out of energy, but we had a wonderful last trip together,"" her husband wrote. She was 73. They lived in Manhattan and on Atlantic Avenue in Amagansett. Ms. Mason regularly taught a course on V.S. Naipaul, the focus of her doctoral dissertation at New York University. She retired in 2008. In her daily life, her husband described her as ""a private person and a consummate communicator, keenly aware of justice and injustice, and always with a captivating smile for the people she met. She was radiant with energy when preparing for and engaging with students in her classrooms."" She always took note when students were ""full of questions and surprises,"" but was firm when they did not live up to expectations, her husband said. She strived to inspire them to weave their perspectives with accurate information and ""logically progressive thoughts."" In announcing her death to faculty, the Hunter English department called her a ""superb teacher, a valued mentor to junior colleagues, and an inspiring colleague,"" Mr. Mason said. She brought compassion, intelligence, and insight to everything she did at the college, her colleagues stated. 1/3"

Chairwoman and Co-Founder of Bernard Chaus Inc., a trailblazer and role model for generations of women in leadership roles, devoted and beloved grandmother, mother, wife and friend. Overcoming modest beginnings and a most difficult and challenging childhood, Josephine was the American dream. First in partnership with her late husband and then on her own, Josephine was the tireless anchor of Bernard Chaus Inc. As a young mother, she endured the shocking and early loss of her husband, best friend and business partner. Left alone, she raised her then two young sons while taking the reins as one of our Nation's first female public company chief executive officers. Josephine's was a life ever so well led; filled with challenge, success and accomplishment. With singular determination, strength and uncompromising moral values, Josephine charted a course for her company and for her family. Her modesty and retiring personality were hallmarks most especially in the glow of constant career and business accolades including a profile by The New York Times with Josephine championed as the Survivor for Seventh Avenue in a cover story in the Sunday Business Section. But Josephine's unwavering determination to surmount the uncertainties of a business that has humbled so many was not her most satisfying and enduring achievement. Her greatest loves and what for Josephine were the most meaningful blessings and constant sources of joy were her beloved sons, Ariel and Aaron, daughter in-laws Robin and Lacey, Anna's mother Cassandra, and her cherished granddaughters, Zoie, Liv and Anna. Josephine will always live on in the smiles on their faces, their strong and independent personalities, and in their zest for life. Josephine will also live on in the hearts of her colleagues at the Company who in every sense were family to Josephine, and she will live on in the hearts of all whose lives she touched with her warmth, generosity and goodness. Marching to her own contrarian drum, embracing and cherishing every day of her life; Josephine's is a legacy of utmost grace and dignity. Rare and precious in every action and deed, Josephine embodied the American dream; she will be sorely missed. Services will be held Monday November 30th at Temple Emanu-El Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. In lieu of gifts, the family has asked contributions be made to favorite charities in Josephine's name. 1/3"
2015-11-26T00:00:00Z,"OWEN--Richard. Born December 11, 1922, in New York, NY, the Honorable Richard Owen, S.D.N.Y., died peacefully on November 20, 2015, in New York, NY. He was just shy of 93. A member of the Dartmouth Class of 1945, his undergraduate studies were interrupted for several years when he joined the Army Air Corps and served as a navigator in the Pacific during the Second World War. After returning and completing his studies at Dartmouth, he earned his L.L.B. from Harvard Law School in 1950. He relished his days as a trial lawyer, both in private practice and with the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Department of Justice. In 1973, President Nixon appointed him to the federal bench, where he served for almost 40 years. Judge Owen presided over numerous notable cases, including the Mafia Commission case and a copyright infringement case against former Beatle, George Harrison, whom the Judge found to have subconsciously plagiarized the tune for ""My Sweet Lord"". While maintaining a full-time legal career, Judge Owen also pursued his other passion: music. He studied composition with Vittorio Giannini at the Manhattan School of Music where he later received an honorary doctorate and became a member of the Board of Trustees. He met his late wife, Metropolitan Opera soprano Lynn Owen (1933-2014), while studying music at Tanglewood, and they married in 1960. The leading lady in many of his musical works, she was the great love of his life and the mother of his three sons, Carl, David and Richard. Judge Owen went on to compose nine operas, including ""Abigail Adams"" and ""Rain,"" all of which have been performed and acclaimed throughout the U.S. and Europe, including in Lincoln Center. He was also an avid sailor and a champion in several boat designs. Judge Owen touched many lives, especially as a mentor to a generation of young lawyers and law clerks. Both his musical and legal legacy live on in his sons, David and Richard Jr., and his five grandsons, Richard III, Christopher, Peter, James and Thomas. Donations may be made to the Carl Owen Scholarship Fund, Manhattan School of Music, 120 Claremont Ave. New York, NY 10027. A memorial service will be held at 10:30 a.m. on Friday, December 4, at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York City. 1/3"

As the first anniversary of his death approaches, the Mahon family would like to thank everyone for their support and kindness. Your telephone calls and cards were greatly appreciated and have helped us in our grief. Also a big thank you to Dr. Mary Madden of Ft. Lauderdale and the hospice nurses who attended constantly. A native of Galway, Chris went to the US after finishing medical school at NUIG. After completing his residency in psychiatry in Chicago he moved to Fort Lauderdale where he practiced until a few weeks before his death of cancer. He was the son of Patrick Joseph (Sonny) Mahon and Eileen Fox-Mahon of Mary Street and the grandson of James and Hannah Mahon of Mahon's Hotel Forster Street and Thomas Fox and Margaret Fox-Killalea of Caherlea, Claregalway and Killalea's Pub, Galway City. One of six children, four of whom were physicians, he once quipped that he was the product of genetic predestination. In fact such humor, not to mention his keen intelligence and alert scientific curiosity sustained him throughout his arduous career. He was predeceased by his brother Tom of Springfield, Illinois. Also by his long term partner Read Johnson, whose tragic death in 2008 he found devastating. He is survived by his brother Jim J. Mahon of London, his brother Paul F. Mahon MD of Springfield Illinois, his brother Eugene J. Mahon MD of New York, his sister Maeve M. Mahon-Ferriter MD of Ireland, his sisters-in-law Margaret Mahon, Sharon Mahon and Delia Battin-Mahon, his brother-in-law Patrick J. Ferriter, his nephews Sean Mahon, Jason Mahon, Dominic Mahon, Eugene R. Mahon, and John P. Mahon and his nieces Rosalind Mahon and Emer Svoboda. He is deeply missed by his family and friends and by his patients to whom he dedicated all his professional life. Chris's erudition since childhood was prodigious; his depth of reading was phenomenal; his intellectual acuity remained razor sharp until the end. Through living a day at a time the Science of Mind had come to have great intellectual appeal to him as he tried to integrate the mysteries of the human condition into one unifying philosophy and in that spirit a secular prayer to guide him on his further after life odysseys is in order ""may the roads of eternity rise to meet him and may the winds of time be always at his back."" 1/3"

Murray was seen as a visionary in the industry and was universally respected for his integrity and innovation. Murray was also a dedicated philanthropist and passionate activist, providing ongoing support to The Evelyn Lauder Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Federation/UJA, the Anti- Defamation League, and AIPAC, among many others.

2015-11-29T00:00:00Z,"STERN--Walter Jacob, 93, on November 27, 2015. Born in Hamburg, Germany, he immigrated to the United States in 1939 with father, Leopold, mother, Alice, and sister, Marion, and became a citizen in 1943. He served as an officer in the military, including working as a translator in Japan. He received a degree from the Stern School of Business at NYU, and began a career as an executive in the garment industry. In 1962, he married Ruth Klein. Based in Englewood, New Jersey, Walter, Ruth and daughter, Michelle, shared summers on Fire Island, as well as travels to far-flung locations.

2015-11-29T00:00:00Z,"SWANN--Mark. Died November 14, 2015 in Jacksonville Beach, FL. He grew up in Stockbridge, MA, son of Jack and Mary Swann. Attended Lenox School and Le Rosey in Switzerland. BA from Harvard University, 1962, member of the AD, and masters from Cambridge University, England, 1965. Married Mary Dickerman, 1966, the mother of his four children. They lived in York, PA for ten years during which time he was a reporter at the York Gazette and Daily, pioneered organic beef farming, ran several Boston Marathons, and ran for Congress on an anti-nuclear power platform. He would open his campaign speeches by pointing out that he was on the Nixon White House Enemies list - a proud distinction he assumed he earned through his work fighting nuclear power while also promoting the great passion of his life: Ocean Solar Power (OTEC). He continued this passion and worked with Hilbert and Jim Anderson, founders of Sea Solar Power, Inc. for the next 50 years. In 1976, he moved to Washington, DC, where, for 35 years, he operated a fireplace restoration and design company focused on building more efficient fireplaces. He traveled to India to become a certified meditation instructor and then spent a decade teaching meditation to prisoners. He also spent fifteen years working with his lifemate, Diane Sollee, on her Smart Marriages campaign and conferences. In 2012, Mark and Diane retired to Jacksonville Beach, FL. His other passions were skiing, soccer, working for the Democrats - especially Obama; his fireplace manual; and he was a dedicated, life-long health nut. He said it was not even funny that after all his vitamins, vegetables, and jogging, his death was caused by an exotic disease, of which he had never heard, cardiac amyloidosis, for which there is no known cure, or even treatment - except to eat vegetables and exercise. He liked to point out that of the three types of cardiac amyloidosis he had the so-called wild type and he would also like to point out, for what it is worth, that his arteries were found to be clean as a whistle, no plaque anywhere.

2015-11-29T00:00:00Z,"COHEN--Rick, 64, prominent community activist and nonprofit journalist, died suddenly at his Virginia home on November 16, 2015. A son of the housing projects of East Boston, Rick graduated Boston University in 1972, paying his way through by driving a taxi and sorting mail at night. He earned a master's degree in city planning from the University of Pennsylvania in 1975. For the next 25 years, he rose rapidly through the ranks of urban government and nonprofits, serving as a planner for Action for Boston Community Development; director of the Jersey City Department of Housing and Economic Development; vice president of James Rouse's Enterprise Foundation of Columbia, Maryland; and vice president for planning and operations at the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, the nation's largest nonprofit community development intermediary. In these posts, Rick became known for his unswerving and incorruptible devotion to the interests of the poor and marginalized. Rick's reputation for courage and devotion to social justice only increased when he became executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy in 1999. Under his leadership, NCRP maintained that foundations too often failed to support social justice groups, preferring instead to direct resources to safe and compliant mainstream nonprofits or institutional self- aggrandizement. He was named five times to the NonProfit Times'annual Power and Influence Top 50. Rick turned his experience into a steady stream of articles and op-eds for publications like the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, and the San Francisco Chronicle, and nonprofit outlets like Nonprofit Quarterly, Blue Avocado, and the Stanford Social Innovation Review. This prepared him for what many regard as the most productive and influential period of his career, his service as national correspondent for the Nonprofit Quarterly, beginning in 2006. There, he produced an astonishingly prolific flow of lengthy investigative stories and shorter articles, bringing his deep- seated compassion and hard- earned wisdom to bear on a broad range of interests: the decline of housing and community groups, the corrupt self-dealing of some leading charities, the plight of the rural as well as urban poor, the neglect of veterans, the struggle against racism, and the fate of Detroit. He never wavered from his lifework's consistent theme that the nation's leading public and private anti-poverty groups all too often failed to honor their professed commitment to the interests of the marginalized. As one observer noted, he was something of a ""Columbo"" of the nonprofit world, charming, self- deprecating and unerring in his investigatory instincts. Rick's daily journalistic output was eagerly anticipated by the widest range of readers, from foundation presidents - who respected his devotion to hard evidence even while subjected to his criticism - to grassroots nonprofit leaders, who heard their hopes and aspirations echoed in Rick's words. Rick is survived by his daughter Eleanor, his fiancee Ellen Giordano, her daughter Eve and his beloved dog Murphy. A public service celebrating Rick's life will be held in January, 2016. 1/3"

Overcoming modest beginnings and a most difficult and challenging childhood, Josephine was the American dream. First in partnership with her late husband and then on her own, Josephine was the tireless anchor of Bernard Chaus Inc. As a young mother, she endured the shocking and early loss of her husband, best friend and business partner. Left alone, she raised her then two young sons while taking the reins as one of our Nation's first female public company chief executive officers. Josephine's was a life ever so well led; filled with challenge, success and accomplishment. With singular determination, strength and uncompromising moral values, Josephine charted a course for her company and for her family. Her modesty and retiring personality were hallmarks most especially in the glow of constant career and business accolades including a profile by The New York Times with Josephine championed as the Survivor for Seventh Avenue in a cover story in the Sunday Business Section. But Josephine's unwavering determination to surmount the uncertainties of a business that has humbled so many was not her most satisfying and enduring achievement. Her greatest loves and what for Josephine were the most meaningful blessings and constant sources of joy were her beloved sons, Ariel and Aaron, daughter in-laws Robin and Lacey, Anna's mother Cassandra, and her cherished granddaughters, Zoie, Liv and Anna. Josephine will always live on in the smiles on their faces, their strong and independent personalities, and in their zest for life. Josephine will also live on in the hearts of her colleagues at the Company who in every sense were family to Josephine, and she will live on in the hearts of all whose lives she touched with her warmth, generosity and goodness. Marching to her own contrarian drum, embracing and cherishing every day of her life; Josephine's is a legacy of utmost grace and dignity.

Albert, a loving husband, father and grandfather passed away peacefully in his bed, at home, from age related diseases Saturday, November 21st with his family by his side. He is survived by his wife Dolly Borgia, and his four children Juliet, Christopher Stefan, and Camille. His sister Mary Phillips, brother John and six grandchildren Marlon, Alexander, Scarlett, Olivia, Roman and Violett also survived him. He was born in Newton, NJ and was raised in Little Italy and the Bronx, NY. He was one of seven children. At age 19, he enlisted and became a G.I. in the Army. Shortly thereafter, he was sent to England to train for the D-Day invasion. He frequently recounted his war stories, like Eisenhower exhorting the troops on, after braving the English Channel and securing the Normandy beachhead. But his proudest and profoundly saddest recollections were of opening the gates of Dachau and seeing those who had been left to die in the concentration camps. Albert was a true American war hero. After the war, and aided by the GI Bill, Albert went to Theater School. He later had a career as a Playwright, Director, and Actor. He appeared in Fred Zinneman's film ""Hat Full of Rain"", and Co-Produced and starred in the national production of ""Stalag 17"", in addition to working as the Director of the Litchfield Theater in Litchfield, CT. Albert also wrote the documentary, ""Jazz On A Summer's Day"", directed by Bert Stern about the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. However, some of his fondest memories, came from his time working within the Playwright Directors Unit of the Actor's Studio in NYC during the sixties and seventies, where he was chosen to coordinate the writers, as well as stage his plays. Albert authored a book of plays entitled ""6 Unlucky 20th Century American Plays"", which includes ""Don't Get Married We Need You"", produced at the Mercer Theater in Greenwich Village, NYC (1973). Albert married his second wife Ann Davies in 1968. Together, they had three children and lived in Hell's kitchen in the 60s-early 80s across the street from the Actors studio. Albert was a dedicated father and took a job teaching woodshop and playwriting in the mid 70s at the prestigious Trinity School on the upper west side where his three children, and grandchildren attended. In the early 80s, he became a financial advisor, working for Ray Dirks at John Muir & Co, where he ultimately became Senior Vice President. His career in finance lasted a decade before retiring. He was celebrated on Geraldo Rivera's Talk Show as a figure representing success and ""the American dream"". For the last 17 years Albert was happily married to his third wife, and the love of his life, Dolly Borgia. He was a devoted husband to an equally devoted wife. He was a true renaissance man and hero who lived life his way, and was loved by all who had the good fortune of knowing him. Reception will be held on Thursday, December 3rd from 4-6pm.

2015-12-01T00:00:00Z,"ZUCKER-FRANKLIN-- Dorothea, 86, passed away on November 24th in her home in Manhattan. A highly respected hematologist and research scientist, Dorothea contributed to the basis of contemporary cell biology through her work on the microarchitecture of blood cells, including platelets, lymphocytes and megakaryocytes. Dorothea began life in Berlin, Germany, just as the National Socialist (Nazi) Party was gaining traction. She moved with her parents and younger sister, Marion, to Amsterdam, where they ultimately attended the same school as Anne Frank. On several occasions, Nazi soldiers visited the house where the family was living, and on at least one occasion, detaining them overnight. No longer able to obtain the visas needed for immigration, they went into hiding in the small town of Uithoorn during the summer of 1943. Following the liberation of Holland, Dorothea attended the Quaker international school in Ommen where she began learning English. In 1946, she boarded the MS Gripsholm with her mother and sister and crossed the Atlantic to arrive in the United States. There, she was able to attend Hunter College after completing her senior year at Forest Hills High School. She served as class president and valedictorian for the Hunter College, CUNY class of 1952 and was later awarded an honorary doctorate by the school. She recalled considerable opposition to her decision to pursue a career in medicine, but persevered and graduated from New York Medical College in 1956, as one of five women in her class. In May of 1956, she married Edward C. Franklin, M.D., beginning the warm and vivacious personal and professional partnership that lasted until his premature death in 1982. Together they purchased and cared for their much loved farm in the Berkshires, travelled internationally, collected pre-Columbian figurines, enjoyed so many of New York's cultural offerings as well as a sabbatical year in Paris and developed a passion for downhill skiing. Dorothea ultimately achieved the rank of full professor at NYU Medical School and continued to accrue professional accolades for the remainder of her career, including election as President of the American Society of Hematologists in 1995 and induction into the Institute of Medicine that same year. In addition to numerous original publications and public presentations, she co-authored a definitive atlas of hematology and saw it through three editions. She is survived by her daughter, Deborah Julie Franklin, PhD, M.D.; grandson, Edward Aaron Franklin; sister, Marion Zucker Goldstein, M.D. and nieces Lillian Goldstein Shapiro, M.D., and Naomi Goldstein. Funeral service Sunday, December 6th at 12 noon at Riverside Memorial Chapel. Charitable contributions to Selfhelp Community Services or Yad Vashem in her name are preferred in lieu of flowers. 1/3"

Helen Wetmore Brann, acclaimed literary agent, died suddenly on Monday, November 30, 2015, of complications from cancer. She was 82. Born in Colorado Springs, Colorado to Maurice Robert Brann and Alice Cynthia Wetmore. She attended The Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, CT, and graduated from Smith College in 1954. Wishing to pursue a career as a writer, she got a job as a receptionist at the New Yorker. From 1958 to 1963 she lived in England and Ireland, working as a freelance editor while writing her own novel. In 1963, she returned to New York and worked part-time for literary agent James Oliver Brown. She soon had clients of her own, among them Diane Johnson and Edmund White. In 1968, she moved to the Sterling Lord Agency. In 1974, she took a leap of faith and started The Helen Brann Agency. Eventually she shared an office with the legendary dramatic rights literary agent, Flora Roberts, where they became close friends as well as business associates. Helen moved her business to Western Connecticut in 1990 as her client list continued to grow. For decades she has represented many talented writers, including Julian Barnes, Richard Brautigan, Gerald Clarke, Nora Johnson, Daniel Yergin, Ingrid Thoft, Chuck Scarborough, Rod McKuen, Barbara Leaming, William Wright, Stephen Sondheim, Robert B. Parker and Maya Angelou. By opening her own literary agency, she became a trail blazer for women. In 2007, Helen was involved with Hillary Clinton's Presidential campaign and she was pleased when being introduced to Mrs. Clinton, that Mrs. Clinton immediately recalled that Helen was the first woman to open a literary agency of her own. In October 2004, she married Faith Stewart-Gordon, artist and former owner of the Russian Tea Room in New York. They lived together in their Bridgewater home along with their many animals including goats, horses, cats and dogs. Helen owned several race horses and bred champion Norwich Terriers.

2015-12-02T00:00:00Z,"ZUCKER-FRANKLIN-- Dorothea, 86, passed away on November 24th in her home in Manhattan. A highly respected hematologist and research scientist, Dorothea contributed to the basis of contemporary cell biology through her work on the microarchitecture of blood cells, including platelets, lymphocytes and megakaryocytes. Dorothea began life in Berlin, Germany, just as the National Socialist (Nazi) Party was gaining traction. She moved with her parents and younger sister, Marion, to Amsterdam, where they ultimately attended the same school as Anne Frank. On several occasions, Nazi soldiers visited the house where the family was living, and on at least one occasion, detaining them overnight. No longer able to obtain the visas needed for immigration, they went into hiding in the small town of Uithoorn during the summer of 1943. Following the liberation of Holland, Dorothea attended the Quaker international school in Ommen where she began learning English. In 1946, she boarded the MS Gripsholm with her mother and sister and crossed the Atlantic to arrive in the United States. There, she was able to attend Hunter College after completing her senior year at Forest Hills High School. She served as class president and valedictorian for the Hunter College, CUNY class of 1952 and was later awarded an honorary doctorate by the school. She recalled considerable opposition to her decision to pursue a career in medicine, but persevered and graduated from New York Medical College in 1956, as one of five women in her class. In May of 1956, she married Edward C. Franklin, M.D., beginning the warm and vivacious personal and professional partnership that lasted until his premature death in 1982. Together they purchased and cared for their much loved farm in the Berkshires, travelled internationally, collected pre-Columbian figurines, enjoyed so many of New York's cultural offerings as well as a sabbatical year in Paris and developed a passion for downhill skiing. Dorothea ultimately achieved the rank of full professor at NYU Medical School and continued to accrue professional accolades for the remainder of her career, including election as President of the American Society of Hematologists in 1995 and induction into the Institute of Medicine that same year. In addition to numerous original publications and public presentations, she co-authored a definitive atlas of hematology and saw it through three editions. She is survived by her daughter, Deborah Julie Franklin, PhD, M.D.; grandson, Edward Aaron Franklin; sister, Marion Zucker Goldstein, M.D. and nieces Lillian Goldstein Shapiro, M.D., and Naomi Goldstein.

In the 1960s and 70s, as Sally Logemann, Ms. Johnson was a founding member of the Waverly Consort and founder and director of the New York Renaissance Band, appearing at New York's Lincoln Center and at concert halls and music festivals worldwide. Starting as a modern oboist, Sally eventually played over a dozen instruments, including baroque oboe, shawm, recorder, dulcian, krummhorn, rackett, bells, harp and drums. She recorded extensively for Columbia, Nonesuch and Arabesque. Her groups also performed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Library of Congress, colleges and universities throughout the US and at The White House (a Shakespeare Birthday concert in 1983). Her foreign tours included most of South America, the Casals Festival in Puerto Rico and the Medeira Bach Festival. Born Sally Ann Elizabeth Bartel in Spokane WA, August 7, 1936, Sally was a musical prodigy, winning Major Bowes Amateur Hour on piano at age five. She graduated from Roosevelt High School in Seattle WA in 1954 and was immediately hired to play oboe and English horn for two years in the Vancouver (BC) Symphony. Sally attended the University of Washington then moved to New York with her first husband Joseph Golden, principal French horn for the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein, for whom he also played in the original production of West Side Story. Sally graduated from the Manhattan School of Music, then, after Joe's death from melanoma in 1960, joined the Master of Music program at New York University. There she began playing Medieval and Renaissance music, and, with fellow students, started the Waverly Consort (named for Waverly Place, site of the NYU music building). In 1972, she formed her own group, the New York Renaissance Band, with a dozen players, specializing in big-band Renaissance sound. After leaving music in the 1980s, Sally was a sales rep for United Airlines, computer specialist for CNA Insurance (she survived 9/11 in an underground vault on Wall St.) and realtor for Corcoran Group.

2015-12-04T00:00:00Z,"SCHLESINGER--Sheldon J.,85, of Golden Beach, passed away December 2, 2015 surrounded by his family and members of his law firm. He was born in Brooklyn, NY and moved to Florida to attend the University of Miami and the University of Miami School of Law where he met his beloved wife Barbara to whom he was married for 60 years. They had two sons, Scott and Gregg, who both followed their father's lead and became lawyers and practiced with him. They were fortunate to have six grandchildren, a constant source of happiness. He knew as a very young man that he was going to be a lawyer and he enjoyed every minute of his career. His favorite place was in a courtroom. His passing will leave a void in the legal community where he was greatly respected by judges, colleagues and opponents alike. As avid supporters of civic and charitable organizations, the Schlesinger family is actively involved in the South Florida community. Mr. Schlesinger served on the Board of Governors of Nova- Southeastern Law Center and served as chairman of the Board of Trustees of Broward Community College. Early on he got involved with Broward Community College because he believed strongly in giving an opportunity for a college education to anyone who wanted one; a building on the Hollywood Campus is named for him. Sheldon J. Schlesinger was one of the most successful personal injury and medical malpractice attorneys in the United States. For over 60 years, he represented individuals and consumers in landmark cases across the nation. He was listed in every edition of the book ""The Best Lawyers in America."" He had, and deserved, a reputation for being one of the best trial attorneys in the United States. The Miami Herald described Shelly as ""The Dean of Broward Civil Litigators."" The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel described him as a ""Bulldog for the Underdog,"" a ""super-lawyer in every sense of the word,"" and ""one of the most powerful personal injury attorneys in the country."" At the conclusion of a lengthy trial where his client emerged victorious, the presiding judge entered a court order describing him as ""one of the most experienced and skilled attorneys which the Florida Bar has to offer,"" and that his ""experience and ability in medical malpractice litigation is exceeded by no one."" Mr. Schlesinger won significant verdicts and settlements in numerous high profile cases. He set national records for plaintiffs' attorneys, including products liability cases against major automotive manufacturers. In 1995, he was part of the landmark legal team that successfully defeated the tobacco industry on behalf of the citizens of Florida. He was one of the founders of the Broward County Trial Lawyers Association and served as its president. He was a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates, one of the nation's most prestigious organizations for plaintiff lawyers. Because of the number of high profile cases he won, he was the subject of numerous interviews and stories in newspapers, magazines and television.

2015-12-06T00:00:00Z,"ACTIS-GRANDE--Caryl. After a tenacious struggle with lung cancer, Caryl Actis-Grande passed away at her home in Westport, Connecticut on Saturday November 28, 2015. She was 77 years old. As the co-founder and CEO of Actis-Grande & Associates, she was a longtime fixture in the fashion industry operating buying offices in Paris, London, New York, Milan and Florence. She played an integral role in launching the careers of designers including Azzedine Alaia, Jean Paul Gaultier and Patrick Kelly. Born Caryl Sherman in New York, New York on March 22, 1938, she graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1960 and later received her Master of Arts in Liberal Arts from St. John's College in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Ms. Actis-Grande began her career in the training program at Bloomingdale's and then became the fashion director for women's accessories at B. Altman and Company. In 1976, she and her husband Richard Actis-Grande, a former Look magazine editor, opened their own Paris- based firm Actis-Grande Associates - a buying office whose list of clients would grow to include Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Holt Renfrew, Lane Crawford and Harvey Nichols. Outside of work, Ms. Actis- Grande was a world traveller, a voracious reader, an avid museumgoer, and an active member of the Santa Fe Opera Guild. She and her husband kept homes in New Mexico, London, Paris, New York, and The Bahamas. She enjoyed pursuits both sporting and intellectual - equally at home trekking through the high peaks of Nepal or attending an author reading at the Hay-on-Wye festival in Wales. She had just moved to Westport, Connecticut this fall when her cancer became terminal. Upon receiving the diagnosis, her response was an echo of Edith Piaf, ""I regret nothing. No tears. It has been a full and wonderful life."" Ms Actis-Grande is survived by her husband of 56 years, Richard, and her two devoted nephews--Mr. Richard A. Sherman of Summit, New Jersey and Mr. John S. Brodie of Manhattan. She was a beloved ""Granny"" to Kyle and Amy Sherman as well as Nicholas and Alexandra Brodie. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to St. John's College, Santa Fe, New Mexico. 1/3"
2015-12-06T00:00:00Z,"ZUCKER-FRANKLIN-- Dorothea, 86, passed away on November 24th in her home in Manhattan. A highly respected hematologist and research scientist, Dorothea contributed to the basis of contemporary cell biology through her work on the microarchitecture of blood cells, including platelets, lymphocytes and megakaryocytes. Dorothea began life in Berlin, Germany, just as the National Socialist (Nazi) Party was gaining traction. She moved with her parents and younger sister, Marion, to Amsterdam, where they ultimately attended the same school as Anne Frank. On several occasions, Nazi soldiers visited the house where the family was living, and on at least one occasion, detaining them overnight. No longer able to obtain the visas needed for immigration, they went into hiding in the small town of Uithoorn during the summer of 1943. Following the liberation of Holland, Dorothea attended the Quaker international school in Ommen where she began learning English. In 1946, she boarded the MS Gripsholm with her mother and sister and crossed the Atlantic to arrive in the United States. There, she was able to attend Hunter College after completing her senior year at Forest Hills High School. She served as class president and valedictorian for the Hunter College, CUNY class of 1952 and was later awarded an honorary doctorate by the school. She recalled considerable opposition to her decision to pursue a career in medicine, but persevered and graduated from New York Medical College in 1956, as one of five women in her class. In May of 1956, she married Edward C. Franklin, M.D., beginning the warm and vivacious personal and professional partnership that lasted until his premature death in 1982. Together they purchased and cared for their much loved farm in the Berkshires, travelled internationally, collected pre-Columbian figurines, enjoyed so many of New York's cultural offerings as well as a sabbatical year in Paris and developed a passion for downhill skiing. Dorothea ultimately achieved the rank of full professor at NYU Medical School and continued to accrue professional accolades for the remainder of her career, including election as President of the American Society of Hematologists in 1995 and induction into the Institute of Medicine that same year. In addition to numerous original publications and public presentations, she co-authored a definitive atlas of hematology and saw it through three editions. She is survived by her daughter, Deborah Julie Franklin, PhD, M.D.; grandson, Edward Aaron Franklin; sister, Marion Zucker Goldstein, M.D. and nieces Lillian Goldstein Shapiro, M.D., and Naomi Goldstein. Funeral service Sunday, December 6th at 12 noon at Riverside Memorial Chapel. Charitable contributions to Selfhelp Community Services or Yad Vashem in her name are preferred in lieu of flowers. 1/3"

2015-12-06T00:00:00Z,"SCHLESINGER--Sheldon J.,85, of Golden Beach, passed away December 2, 2015 surrounded by his family and members of his law firm. He was born in Brooklyn, NY and moved to Florida to attend the University of Miami and the University of Miami School of Law where he met his beloved wife Barbara to whom he was married for 60 years. They had two sons, Scott and Gregg, who both followed their father's lead and became lawyers and practiced with him. They were fortunate to have six grandchildren, a constant source of happiness. He knew as a very young man that he was going to be a lawyer and he enjoyed every minute of his career. His favorite place was in a courtroom. His passing will leave a void in the legal community where he was greatly respected by judges, colleagues and opponents alike. As avid supporters of civic and charitable organizations, the Schlesinger family is actively involved in the South Florida community. Mr. Schlesinger served on the Board of Governors of Nova- Southeastern Law Center and served as chairman of the Board of Trustees of Broward Community College. Early on he got involved with Broward Community College because he believed strongly in giving an opportunity for a college education to anyone who wanted one; a building on the Hollywood Campus is named for him. Sheldon J. Schlesinger was one of the most successful personal injury and medical malpractice attorneys in the United States. For over 60 years, he represented individuals and consumers in landmark cases across the nation. He was listed in every edition of the book ""The Best Lawyers in America."" He had, and deserved, a reputation for being one of the best trial attorneys in the United States. The Miami Herald described Shelly as ""The Dean of Broward Civil Litigators."" The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel described him as a ""Bulldog for the Underdog,"" a ""super-lawyer in every sense of the word,"" and ""one of the most powerful personal injury attorneys in the country."" At the conclusion of a lengthy trial where his client emerged victorious, the presiding judge entered a court order describing him as ""one of the most experienced and skilled attorneys which the Florida Bar has to offer,"" and that his ""experience and ability in medical malpractice litigation is exceeded by no one."" Mr. Schlesinger won significant verdicts and settlements in numerous high profile cases. He set national records for plaintiffs' attorneys, including products liability cases against major automotive manufacturers. In 1995, he was part of the landmark legal team that successfully defeated the tobacco industry on behalf of the citizens of Florida. He was one of the founders of the Broward County Trial Lawyers Association and served as its president. He was a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates, one of the nation's most prestigious organizations for plaintiff lawyers. Because of the number of high profile cases he won, he was the subject of numerous interviews and stories in newspapers, magazines and television. He appeared in Time, People, Forbes, Florida Trend, New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. He appeared on CBS 60 Minutes, ABC's 20/20, the Phil Donahue Show, and numerous other national and local television and news programs. Recently, he was inducted into the Trial Lawyer Hall of Fame held at Temple University in Pennsylvania; he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Florida Verdicts Hall of Fame by the Daily Business Review; and he was honored to give a Legacy lecture to his cherished Inner Circle of Advocates. He is survived by his sons: Scott (m. Anne) and Gregg; his six grandchildren: Charlotte, Alexander, Molly, Theodora, Samuel, and Theodore; and his brother-in-law, Larry Butler (m. Grace).

He graduated in 1947 from Princeton with honors and degrees in Art History and Comparative Religion. He served as a Navy Lieutenant in both the Second World War and the Korean War. Frederick's career as a high school teacher began by chance when he was asked to fill in as a substitute religion teacher at St. George's School in Newport, RI. He was a gifted and versatile teacher and actor who taught the humanities at college preparatory schools on both coasts. He was well known for his booming voice, humor, mimicry and classroom theatrics, sometimes throwing books or jumping on top of a desk to convey his passion for the subjects he loved. Frederick will be remembered as the director and co-founder of The School of Arts and Sciences, an experimental high school in San Anselmo, CA. Here Frederick and his colleague David Donnelley were able to put into practice their innovative and progressive ideas on education. The school emphasized collaboration rather than competition, and encouraged students to be conscious of social values and the need to protect the environment. Frederick met his wife, Marilyn Van Hoosear, while she was attending graduate school at New York University. The two were married in 1955 and had a litter of five children: Jennifer, Eric and Christopher who live in New York; and Gregory and Melissa who live in California. Frederick is survived by seven grandchildren. After retiring in 1989, Frederick lived in Sonoma with Marilyn and kept a small studio in Berkeley. Over the years his paintings were shown in various galleries in Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2002, Frederick met his partner Panya Pringchamras, with whom he lived from 2008 until his death. Frederick loved books, gardens, nature and life. He was a brilliant and complex man who will be missed by his family, his friends, and the many students he inspired. 1/3"

Sue had many interests, including tennis and golf in her earlier years and needlepoint, Nantucket basket weaving, Mahjong and croquet. She worked on her needlepoint projects with great love, ultimately giving her creations to those closest to her. She approached these interests with great enthusiasm and basically taught herself croquet in her senior years. She was a member of the croquet clubs in Marion, Massachusetts, Greenwich, Connecticut and Naples, Florida and was considered a tough opponent on the court. Sue was an avid reader who enjoyed sharing her love of literature with her friends. She was known by many for the wonderful, well thought out gifts that she gave for no reason at all. Along with her husband, Philip, Susan helped establish the Whitby School in Greenwich in 1958. Susan was the great- granddaughter of Major General Lew Wallace, whose statue stands in Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. He fought in three significant battles in the Civil War. In 1880, he authored Ben Hur, a best-selling novel that has been called the most significant Christian book in the 19th century. Sue enjoyed being near or in the water and was most happy in her home in Marion, Massachusetts where she spent over 45 summers enjoying her family and friends. Services will be held at 10:30am on Saturday, December 5 at St. Michael The Archangel Roman Catholic Church, 469 North Street, Greenwich, CT. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the General Lew Wallace Study and Museum, 200 Wallace Avenue, PO Box 662, Crawfordsville, IN 47933. 1/3"
2015-12-06T00:00:00Z,"FISTER--Edward J. In Memory of a great American Patriot, Edward J. Fister, Chief Civilian Scientist of the Signal Corps., a pioneer in the development of radar, having installed same at Pearl Harbor. His career centered on the then-revolutionary invention called RADAR (radio detection and ranging). His responsibilities were taking lab and theoretical breakthroughs in radar from the lab to the field. Radar was possibly the single most important technology developed during the war, easily on a par with cryptography and the atom bomb. It was a key reason why England could win the Battle of Britain. Ed's work during WWII was critical to getting radar to where it made a difference, and hence to the war effort. His early projects included important complex radar systems, including the Variable Time Fuze, a miniature radar transmitter/receiver to be installed on the front end of a bomb that would explode the device at a set altitude above the target, enabling Allied artillery and bombs to increase their effectiveness. It was a revolutionary development and in this way we can say Edward John Fister had a very personal role in bringing about the end to WWII. For the VT Fuze he received the War Department Meritorious Citizen Award. The real men in black, of which Dad was one, worked on the Manhattan Project, set up Oak Ridge, worked at Area 51, White Sands Missile Range and more, all documented. Most importantly, these were men who could be trusted with our national security, setting up the DEW line, working on Project Diana, which gave birth to NASA. To honor Dad and all in that era, whose lives were lost at Pearl Harbor, and in the harrowing events of that terrible war. Love you, Dad. Ellen 1/3"

Edgar Hoover, Mortimer Daniel Rubin, known as Danny, died Tuesday, December 1, at the age of 84. Danny joined the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) during the McCarthy Era, moved by the idea of a political system based on social, racial and economic justice and equality. In that movement, to which he devoted the rest of his life, he met and married his life partner, Dorothy Cohan. The pair moved from Philadelphia to Brooklyn in 1960, where their children Rose and Joseph were born. Danny was a defendant in one of the McCarren Act cases that ultimately led to that law being struck down by the Supreme Court in the mid 1960s. Over the years, Danny took part in electoral campaigns at all levels, as well as every major social campaign from the Civil Rights Movement to opposing Bruce Ratner's Atlantic Yards project. He also served in many roles in the CPUSA, including as national organizational secretary and then national education secretary. He was active even this year. Danny loved Beethoven, chocolate, a good meal and The New York Times. He took pride in having met the great Paul Robeson twice. He was a gentle and affectionate father and grandfather who always had a hug and a kiss and a few choice words of advice. He is survived by his wife, Dorothy; children, Rose and Joe; daughter-in-law, Dolores; and grandchildren, Hector, Jason, Jesse and Selena. 1/3"
