2007-09-18T00:00:00Z,"Throughout the inaugural weeks of his presidential campaign, Fred D. Thompson, the newest Republican candidate, has compared the debates to a circus show, with seals lining up to catch fish. And while he has said that he is ''not above acting like a seal every once in a while,'' his coyness about exactly when he will participate in debates has left some Republicans wondering what was behind his hesitation. The campaign, however, disclosed Mr. Thompson's October debate schedule yesterday, and despite speculation about his supposed reluctance to debate, his commitments match the list of established Republican debates that month. The campaign announced that Mr. Thompson would appear at an Oct. 9 debate sponsored by CNBC on economic issues in Dearborn, Mich.; an Oct. 14 forum in Manchester, N.H.; and, a week later, at a debate in Orlando, Fla."

Graduated from Knox College, in Illinois, where he was captain of the football team. Served with the Army in Korea, where he was lent to the Korean Military Advisor Group as a cryptographer. Graduated from Harvard Business School in 1955. Named Senior Creative Director in charge of new product development at Marschalk advertising agency, a subsidiary of Interpublic Companies.

Of the six varieties, the wild salmon and vegetables, couscous, three beans and corn, and the whole grains and beans were surprisingly good and well seasoned. Pasta with tuna and pasta with vegetables both had an off-putting, somewhat slimy texture. All are made without preservatives.

2007-09-20T00:00:00Z,"The recent uproar over stealing signals reminded us that more pitchers seem to be holding their glove in front of their face when they talk to their catcher or manager -- presumably to prevent adept lip-readers on opposing teams from gathering information. The glove-as-mask tactic has made the mound resemble Halloween at Rawlings. The Yankees’ Andy Pettitte becomes almost completely faceless -- except for a pair of peering eyes -- when he lifts his glove up toward his pulled-down cap. But using the glove as a shield apparently has other purposes, too. The Times’s Tyler Kepner tells us that former Yankee Scott Proctor performed this action more than anyone he can remember -- because the lip-reader he feared the most was his wife. It seems Proctor’s wife didn’t like seeing him spew expletives on the mound when he pitched poorly. So he reflexively put his glove in front of his mouth to hide his expletives, and then just kept doing it. And remembering Proctor’s early struggles with New York, it’s easy to understand why his words weren’t family friendly."

Two years ago, New Yorkers lined up to hike through shipping containers he stacked on a Hudson River pier as a mobile art cathedral for Gregory Colbert's majestic animal photography. And who can forget his Tokyo apartment with its exterior walls made of flapping white curtains? Now Mr. Ban, right, has returned to Manhattan's West Side with a design for a condominium on 19th Street near 11th Avenue that can be thrown open entirely to the elements. The Metal Shutter Houses are nine duplex apartments (ranging in size from a 1,950-square-foot three-bedroom to a 3,180-square-foot four-bedroom penthouse with three terraces, above right) encased in perforated metal shutters that operate exactly like the rolling grates of the Chelsea galleries and Korean delis that inspired them. Duplex owners will be able to mechanically adjust their own shutters, and inside each apartment, a 20-foot window wall will pivot open, above left, getting these few Manhattanites as close to California living as they might possibly dream of being.

2007-09-21T16:59:54Z,"AIRPORTS: Most visitors' first glimpse of Turkey will take place as they fly over the sprawl of Istanbul's seemingly endless apartment blocks and neighborhoods dotted with mosques before landing at Istanbul Ataturk Airport. Named for the founder of the modern Turkish republic, this modern facility is pretty easy to negotiate upon arrival. Many Westerners needing a visa can buy one at the airport, just prior to going through passport control. (Be sure to check in your home country first!) It's a short walk to the baggage carousels and the duty free shops. If you have friends who live in town, ask them before hand if you can pick something up here for them: alcohol, perfumes and, yes, the ever popular cigarettes, are much cheaper here. One annoyance is that the luggage carts are not free of charge as they are in many European airports. Who has Turkish lira coins at this point? Once you have your bags and your duty free treats, proceed to the exit. Yes, there is a customs desk, but controls are few and far between. Once in the main concourse, you will find ATMs for getting local currency and even a Starbucks and a Gloria Jeans in case you just simply cannot wait for a dose of caffeine. Please note that departing passengers really do need to get here 2 hours before their flights. The lines can be mind-bogglingly long, there are several checkpoints before reaching your plane and the shopping opportunities get better on your way to the gate."

These and other similarly loopy ephemera populate Found magazine, the compilation of one man's trash, another's treasure that has spawned two books. Since it began publishing in 2001, the magazine, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., has invited readers all over the world to send in photos, mixtapes, memos, diary entries, to-do lists and any other lost missives they come upon. The fifth issue, out Oct. 9, has a crime theme, based on the serendipitous discovery of an F.B.I. agent's files in an Indiana Dumpster. ''He was a particularly hapless F.B.I. agent; he kept losing his gun,'' said Davy Rothbart, one of the magazine's founders. ''There's all these letters between him and J. Edgar Hoover where he's, like, begging to keep his job.'' Mr. Rothbart and his brother and co-editor, Peter, will read excerpts of these and other hits tonight in a stop on their 65-city, three-month tour. Peter Rothbart will perform songs inspired by the magazine's discoveries (like ''The Baddest Nissan in the Northeast''). ''I'm endlessly curious about the glimpse into other people's lives that you can get from these notes,'' said Davy Rothbart, en route from a reading at a Catholic girls' school in New Hampshire. ''And the great thing about doing these tours is that people bring found stuff every night.'' In Vermont, a woman gave him a ''To Not Do'' list she found. It read, in part: ''DO NOT spend money on anything except clothing for winter/Halloween, groceries, sushi, metal show/the movie 'Kill Bill.' DO NOT fall in love with any strangers. DO NOT eat junk!! Any form of potato or corn chips -- no Frito's, no Lay's, no Ruffles, no Cape Cod, nothing. DO NOT borrow money from Mom. DO NOT watch pornographic movies.'' (And more in that X-rated vein.) ''That's why we go to 65 cities,'' Mr. Rothbart said. ''To collect ones like this.''

2007-09-21T00:00:00Z,"The ouster of the founding director of an art gallery overseen by Syracuse University has drawn protest from academics and art professionals there. The director, Astria Suparak, below, of the Warehouse Gallery, said that Jeffrey Hoone, who oversees the university's art centers, had told her on Sept. 7 that she would be dismissed effective Sept. 30. She said he did not give a reason beyond saying that the gallery was being restructured. (In a telephone interview, Mr. Hoone said he could not discuss Ms. Suparak but that he was revamping the gallery's leadership.) Carole Brzozowski, the dean of Syracuse University, said the content of gallery shows organized by Ms. Suparak had nothing to do with her dismissal. But people in the arts at Syracuse, including university art teachers, asserted that the ouster was related to risk-taking or innovative exhibitions she organized since becoming the director last year. (Many have posted protests of her dismissal at syracuse-warehouse.blogspot.com.) Ms. Suparak said of Mr. Hoone: ''My aesthetic is very different from his. I'm interested in street art, riot grrl and D.I.Y. aesthetics.'' A sign at the entrance to the gallery's current show, ''Come On: Desire Under the Female Gaze,'' reads, ''This exhibition contains work generally intended for mature audiences.'' Ms. Suparak said it was posted at Mr. Hoone's behest."

2007-09-21T00:00:00Z,"With debuts of two new shows, Fox edged into first place Wednesday in the ratings among adults 18 to 49. Fox's new 9 p.m. offering, ''Kitchen Nightmares,'' with the chef Gordon Ramsay (''Hell's Kitchen''), earned the night's top ratings in that demographic, although it attracted just 6.6 million total viewers, Nielsen estimated. Earlier, the 8 p.m. hour proved especially competitive. Fox's new comedy ''Back to You,'' with Kelsey Grammer and Patricia Heaton, made a strong debut in the first half hour (9.4 million), followed by a slower start for Season 2 of '' 'Til Death'' at 8:30 (7.8 million). Combined the shows lagged just behind the premiere of CBS's ''Kid Nation'' (9.1 million), while NBC's ''Deal or No Deal'' earned the largest audience for the hour (9.7 million). NBC ranked second over all in both total viewers and the 18 to 49 set, leading at 10 in that demographic with the second half of ''Last Comic Standing,'' which averaged 7.1 million viewers from 9 to 11. CBS remained the most watched network despite broadcasting reruns following ''Kid Nation,'' and finished third in the 18 to 49 demographic, ahead of ABC. Meanwhile CW's premieres of ''Gossip Girl'' at 9 (3.7 million) and the ninth edition of ''America's Next Top Model'' at 8 (5.1 million) gave the network a tie for first for the night among the 18 to 34 set, matching NBC and Fox."

In the yard behind her Brooklyn studio, this young, Cuban-born artist builds wild, intricate sand castles incorporating elements of different world civilizations and architectural monuments: the Taj Mahal, the Coliseum, the Colossus of Rhodes and the Great Wall of China. She then destroys them, recording the ruin in big, high-gloss photographs (left), half a dozen of which are now showing at Black & White Gallery in Chelsea. (More of her photographs are showing in the survey ''Infinite Island: Contemporary Caribbean Art'' at the Brooklyn Museum.) Ideas of chaos and destruction come to mind when looking at these images, reminding us that the unrest in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere is nothing new. There is something sad about that, though Ms. Castillo has found a way of exploring it with an acerbic detachment. The sight of the Hollywood sign crumbling into the pyramids is playful yet poignant. All great civilizations eventually come to an end, even our own, just as sand castles on the shore will surely be erased with the rise of the ocean tide. It is only a matter of time.

2007-09-21T00:00:00Z,"For the first time in nearly 360 years Czechs had a chance yesterday to examine the ''Codex Gigas'' in their own land, Agence France-Presse reported. The ''Codex Gigas,'' or ''Devil's Bible,'' a 13th-century, 624-page, 165-pound masterpiece, was once considered one of the eight wonders of the world. Taken as booty from Prague by Swedish troops during the Thirty Years' War, the book, valued at $15.1 million, takes the name ''Devil's Bible'' from its superb illustration, below, of the devil and an accompanying legend. It is on loan for four months from its Swedish owners and on display in a specially designed safelike room in central Prague where visitors are limited to 10 at a time and permitted only a few minutes of viewing time. Legend has it that the ''Devil's Bible'' was the work of a monk condemned to be walled up alive for a grave crime. To escape slow death, he proposed to create a masterwork in a night, to bring glory to the Pozlazice monastery, in what is now the Czech Republic, and eradicate his sins. But to achieve his goal he had to seek help from the Devil, and in recognition of that aid included a illustration of his helper."

''They said they would not film this part,'' the father, Ahmad Jaan Mahmiidzada, told BBC Radio. ''Of course I am worried about it. My own people from my own tribe will turn against me because of the story. They may cut my throat, they may kill me, they may torture me. Anything could happen to me.'' The son has been quoted as saying he fears friends will shun him because they believe he really was raped. Paramount Vantage, the studio behind the film, directed byMarc Forster (''Monster's Ball,'' ''Finding Neverland''), said it would not be released in Afghanistan because the country lacked a distribution system. A spokeswoman declined comment on the rape controversy, but Rebecca Yeldham, a producer, told the BBC that the scene was not explicit and said no promise had been made not to film the scene. ''We don't believe that kids' lives are at risk,'' she added. The film will have its premiere on Nov. 2."

2007-09-21T00:00:00Z,"JOHN MCLAUGHLIN AND THE 4TH DIMENSION An awful lot has changed since the British guitarist John McLaughlin, above, came to prominence, with a whisper and a roar, nearly four decades ago. The post-Woodstock jazz-rock he helped pioneer -- with the Tony Williams Lifetime, and the early electric bands of Miles Davis, and especially his own powerhouse Mahavishnu Orchestra -- gave way to the steroidal excesses of fusion. World music as a strain of pop emerged partly after the example of Shakti, Mr. McLaughlin's Indo-jazz ensemble of the mid-1970s. And as the mainstream culture of jazz shifted its focus from innovation to conservation, Mr. McLaughlin diversified his efforts, delving persuasively into flamenco, classical music and postfusion hybrids. (There is no ready term for the sound he pursued on an album like ''Live at the Royal Festival Hall,'' on JMT.) Through it all the constant has been Mr. McLaughlin's artistry as a virtuoso guitarist and venturesome improviser. Mainly for that reason he has managed not to be eclipsed by his own history. There are now repertory ensembles dedicated to the Mahavishnu Orchestra (well, one at least: the Mahavishnu Project, mahavishnuproject.com) and reissues documenting its reign. And Mr. McLaughlin plays an important role in several Miles Davis boxed sets on Columbia/Legacy, the latest of which is ''The Complete On the Corner Sessions,'' due out on Tuesday. Recently the Legacy imprint also released, for the first time, a bruising 1979 live recording of Mr. McLaughlin with the bassist Jaco Pastorius and the drummer Tony Williams, billed collectively as the Trio of Doom."
2007-09-21T00:00:00Z,"BROOKLYN INDIE HOUSE The microcinema offerings of the five-month-old Brooklyn Indie House could not be more different from the megahits of summer. The theater -- actually two spaces, a roomy lounge and a fitness studio, in Clinton Hill, each holding screenings twice a month -- specializes in independent film, but not the studio-backed ''Little Miss Sunshine'' kind. ''How independent is that?'' Babatunde Odesanya, founder and driving force of the Black and Latino Filmmakers Coalition, says of such movies. The coalition -- made up of local directors, cinematographers, actors and others -- runs these screenings of scrappy movies, some short, some feature length, that play in festivals here and there but get little exposure otherwise. The bills range from the dialogue-less ''Alone'' (above), by Clayton Broomes Jr., about a young woman and an older man who find a ''Sixth Sense''-like connection, to the urban action thriller ''HardRock the Movie.'' Mr. Odesanya said the coalition's first impulse was a festival of work by its members. But then submissions poured in from all over -- Brooklyn, Detroit, Nigeria -- and the idea of regular screenings was born. Filmmakers get five or six showings and a percentage of the box office; in return, they're asked to appear for post-film discussions, which can get lively. ''It's not a cash cow,'' Mr. Odesanya said, ''but then, it's not designed to be.'' (Next screening, ''HardRock the Movie,'' Wednesday at 8 p.m., Jelani lounge, 507 Waverly Avenue, Clinton Hill, brooklynindiehouse.com.) STEPHANIE GOODMAN"

2007-09-21T00:00:00Z,"WILLIAM BOLCOM AND JOAN MORRIS William Bolcom is a great vocal composer. As he approaches his 70th birthday next year, his career highlights are generally held to be his several major operas -- ''McTeague,'' ''A View From the Bridge'' -- but he has also created a nearly unparalleled oeuvre of art songs. The ability to blend vernacular styles (bouncy show tunes, singing melodies) and what might once have been called longhair art is particularly felicitous in the context of cabaret. Mr. Bolcom's major collaborator-lyricist was Arnold Weinstein; between 1963 and 1996 they wrote 24 cabaret songs, including ''Toothbrush Time,'' mainly for the mezzo-soprano Joan Morris, Mr. Bolcom's wife. A performance of the complete works drew rave reviews in 2003; now it returns in benefit performances for the New York Art Ensemble, which will turn the Flea Theater in TriBeCa into a small-scale cabaret. Reviewing the original performance (above), Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times: ''Anyone interested in the cabaret genre and the future of American song, let alone the high artistry of Ms. Morris and Mr. Bolcom, should try to get one of the few remaining tickets''; nothing has changed since then.

2007-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Gov. Sarah Palin ordered state transportation officials to abandon the “bridge to nowhere” project that became a nationwide symbol of federal pork-barrel spending. The $398 million bridge would have connected Ketchikan, on one island in southeastern Alaska, to its airport on another nearby island. “Ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport,” Ms. Palin, a Republican, said in a news release, “but the $398 million bridge is not the answer.” She directed the State Transportation Department to find the most “fiscally responsible” alternative for access to the airport. Ketchikan is Alaska’s entry port for northbound cruise ships that bring more than one million visitors yearly. Flights into Gravina Island require a 15-minute ferry ride to reach the more densely populated Revillagigedo Island and Ketchikan."

The A.F.L.-C.I.O., a group of 55 unions representing nearly 10 million workers, said it had identified 23 states as priorities for next year’s elections, including Ohio, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin. The $53 million budget is up from $50 million in the 2003-4 political cycle, which was before several major unions quit the federation, causing a severe budget problem."

The business, McCall’s BBQ and Seafood Restaurant, had yet to open for the day when the plane crashed around 10 a.m. “The front is completely gone,” said Rhonda Hobbs, who lives behind the restaurant. “The plane is all the way on the inside.” Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta, said officials knew of only one fatality. The authorities had accounted for all of the restaurant employees present and did not believe that the plane carried a passenger. “It was just like a bomb, the force of the wind,” said the restaurant manager, Terry Tyner. “An hour or an hour and a half later, it would have been a massacre.”."

2007-09-22T00:00:00Z,"The State Medical Board overstepped its authority by threatening to punish physicians for participating in executions, a judge ruled, striking down a policy that effectively led to a moratorium on the state’s death penalty. Judge Donald Stephens of Superior Court said state law did not grant the medical board the right to prohibit doctors from assisting in executions. The medical board threatened in January to punish doctors who took active roles in executions, saying that doing so violated the oath to do no harm. State law requires that a doctor be present during a lethal injection, and a federal judge demanded last year that a doctor oversee the process of putting an inmate to death. Dale Breaden, a medical board spokesman, would not comment on the ruling, saying officials would discuss it at their next meeting."

The 6,000-square-foot store has soaring ceilings, views that stretch across the North Shore Mountains and an eclectic mix of men's and women's clothing, jewelry, books, art and music. ''The store's based on my lifestyle,'' Adelberg says. ''I augment the fashion with things I love, like photography, vintage watches and old Louis Vuitton trunks.'' 2. A music and media addict -- he also publishes ''Made,'' a series of art books -- Adelberg buys CDs at Zulu Records (1972 West Fourth Avenue; 604-738-3232).

And yet what makes the movie pleasantly diverting is also what makes it a sham. The vast majority of us who employ nannies simply aren't guilty of the status-choked buffoonery and neglect that provide the film its jokes. Indeed, the mom (played by Laura Linney) who hires a pair of rarefied French mimes to be the entertainment at her little boy's birthday party just isn't typical. Nor is her put-upon nanny, a lusciously diffident college graduate played by Scarlett Johansson who doesn't come from money but nonetheless sees this job as a lark -- a temporary gig, akin to backpacking across Europe for a summer."

It was surprising, however, that Goldsmith's book cites Abraham Lincoln as a hero who is presented as a foil to the Bush administration's broad interpretation of executive power. In fact, Lincoln's own view of executive power was no less extreme. In retrospect, we ignore the radical nature of Lincoln's views because we admire his causes (Union and freedom). In contrast, most who oppose the Bush administration's views do so because they are opposed to its conduct of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. This confuses the issue. Any power can be both used and misused; the question of what the president may do under the Constitution is distinct from the question of what he should do. Legal scholars have a particular responsibility to sever their analysis of the Constitution from their views on current government policy."

(22, 26) THE WAR Ken Burns examines the impact of World War II on four ordinary American towns -- Waterbury, Conn.; Mobile, Ala.; Luverne, Minn.; and Sacramento -- in this new seven-part documentary series, which was six years in the making. ''In recent years, we have been reminded that our arc is not a constant, and I think that we can find in history, so long as we're not attending to the nostalgic or the sentimental, a palliative for these ills,'' Mr. Burns said in a recent interview. ''Someone once said to me that losing a human being is like having a library burn down,'' he added, noting that more than 1,000 military veterans are dying each day. ''This loss of memory is almost palpably felt by someone in the memory business.'' Writing in The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley called Mr. Burns's latest series ''as elegiac and compelling as any of his previous works.'' But, she added, ''Particularly now, as the conflict in Iraq unravels, this degree of insularity -- at such length and detail -- is disconcerting.'' 8 P.M.

The Germans are sending Federal Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel -- but other countries and the European Union are sending officials with far less weighty portfolios.The EU will be represented by Humberto Rosa, the deputy environment minister of Portugal. Stavros Dimas, the EU's environment commissioner, is giving the meeting a miss to ensure that the focus for climate change talks stays at the United Nations and on a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, in December. The British government is sending Phil Woolas rather than its environment minister, Hilary Benn.""There are a number of cocktail parties leading up to the ball in Bali in December, and the meeting in Washington next week is one of them,"" a spokeswoman for Britain's department for the environment told me.""Green"" Europe may be right to snub America over climate change. After all Europeans have been busy implementing the Kyoto Protocol while the Americans have dawdled. What's the point of Europeans endorsing a gathering in Washington if Americans don't yet favor binding targets?But Europe still has a lot of work ahead getting its own house in order. A number of EU countries have failed to meet the modest emissions-reduction targets under Kyoto while newer EU members are resisting future targets, saying they should have a chance to industrialize first so they can reach western European standards of living.Major European industries, including carmakers like Volkswagen, protest that new targets are too onerous. European policy makers also differ on the best way to persuade fast-developing countries to sign a new global treaty.With Europe presenting a somewhat fragmented front, the best hope for bringing China and India into a future treaty probably still remains a unilateral move by the United States to cut emissions. That's unlikely to happen under the Bush administration. So while talks in Washington this week could through up interesting ideas don't expect any real breakthroughs until 2009, when a new U.S. president takes office."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"As a prep school teen on the island of Manhattan I was anxious about getting into college. It seemed like my senior year was consumed with college. All that we talked about in the senior corridor was admissions into a top-tier university. My school was a breeding ground for the ivy-league bound. The greatest tragedy that would befall my classmates and I would be the waitlist of an ivy-league or equally prestigious school. The college process consumed me. The Fisk College Guidebook became my nightly bedtime story, I almost invited my SAT tutor to a family function, and I diligently lunched with my college officer weekly, reviewing application details. Engulfed in the college admissions process, I do not even recall considering the importance of college."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"""I'm not an adult. I'm still just a big kid with some adult responsibilities!"" This feeling runs through the mind of every college-bound teen at least once. Rick Perlstein's article ""What's the Matter With College?"" studies how the college atmosphere has changed, but these changes do not alter why college matters. College teaches responsibility and accountability like no other educational system can, and it exposes students gradually to life expectations, while providing a safety net of guidance and support to prevent failure."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"My generation suffers from technology induced laziness. Our formative years were shaped by (over)exposure to an early '90s novelty, cable television. As we blossomed, so too did the internet, in all its encyclopedic, pornographic glory. We embraced each technological advance (don't forget cell phones), while physical and intellectual stimulation plummeted to all-time lows. Now we're college students. Considering such a childhood, should it come as a shock to discover that today's campuses aren't the raucous, socially progressive playgrounds of the late 1960s/early '70s?"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"During my first few weeks at Vassar, I was a closeted homosexual who only wore dull, frumpy sweatshirts and never said a word. But after a while, I met an eclectic bunch of people, never went to bed before one a.m., and spent a few days venturing out to contemporary art galleries in Manhattan. Now I wear pink sweatshirts and talk quite frequently. So as I read Perlstein's article, I began to realize how different my experience at Vassar seemed from the dreary, corporatized atmosphere surrounding the University of Chicago, the school where, as a friend of mine once grimly put it, ""fun goes to die."" Sure, many of my peers are career-minded and nearly all are academically resolute, yet there is always a childlike blitheness around campus that never ceases to pull us through even the most stressful pre-examination periods. Indeed, as Perlstein notes, the gap between childhood and college has shortened, but not solely in the sense that, because of the Internet, pre-college students now have more information and ideas at their fingertips than ever before. Despite this, there is still a very genuine, nostalgic attachment to carefree elementary school days that I have noticed not only in Vassar students, but also in my friends at home, many of whom are still eager to revel in classic Disney movies, immerse themselves in the latest Harry Potter book, or, as a friend and I once decided to do, organize a Barbie party."

I didn't understand what a ""vocational school"" would be, and I didn't know anyone who would admit to going to community college. For a brief shining moment, the world opened up, as if in flower, each petal another possibility for life outside college. I could go into the army! I could go to beauty school, like in Grease! I could become a - a Beatnik!"

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,I had a brief collegiate crisis at the beginning of this summer.
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"There may be some truth to what Rick Perlstein describes as the disappearance of the classic college experience. To the baby boomer generation, college was an opportunity to open a door to new worlds of knowledge, to do research in fields previously untouched, and to sound really smart saying things no high school kid could understand. Intelligent and intellectually rebellious was cool."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"People associate attending a university or college with broadening their intellectual horizons, exploring new political and social issues, and finally reaching the point in their life when they can live completely independently. As an incoming freshman I cannot say for sure whether all those preconceived notions of college are accurate or inaccurate. However I do know that after a year of stressing over college essays, grades, and test scores, I have very high expectations for what my college experience will be. Currently I am undecided in what my major is going to be, and every college I visited promised me that through the curriculum their school provides I will find my passion. This I believe will be true. I have also been promised an environment of strong political activism, where I will have the opportunity to get involved in any sort of issue or cause if I choose to. This I believe will be true. And college has also promised me an environment where I will meet new people, and have the opportunity to try and see things that I previously never have. This I also believe will be true. All of these different experiences are the appeals that college offers to its students, and it has been this way since the 1960's. Therefore, if college is offering the same academic and social experience as before, why are college campuses becoming more and more apathetic? In my opinion the problem is not that college is changing, but rather that our society as a whole is. It's not that ""College as America used to understand it is coming to an end."" It's that America as the citizens of this country used to understand it is coming to an end."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"What's wrong with college? A lot. Although I can only draw conclusions from my own experience as a student at The City College of New York, I do relate to a lot of the opinions expressed by the college students featured in Rick Perlstein's essay. Perlstein describes the college experience of the 1960's and 70's as a ""social- mobility prerequisite"". Perhaps this is no longer true. I have met a lot of students my age who are pursuing law, engineering, or medical degrees. Many admit that they are pursuing subjects that lead to careers that their parents approve of, despite their own desires. However, there is awareness among my generation that college is no longer the one-way ticket to a higher step on the social ladder. As a result, students are planning advanced degrees - at least a Master's degree, along with any other special fellowships, internships, and extra classes that may help."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The image of the college campus as, in Rick Perlstein's words, ""a mystic world apart, where 18-year-olds discover themselves for the first time in a heady atmosphere of cultural and intellectual tumult,"" does not seem to exist in the twenty-first century, at least not to the extent it did in the 1960s and 70s. College is less of a national and cultural landmark as it is a necessity and emblem of prestige. More and more students are applying to and attending college today, not because they lust after the new life and independence it will offer, but because it is an obligatory prerequisite for careers. Competition for acceptance into the most prestigious colleges has increased, not because the enlightening landscape these schools offer, but because it is a vehicle for one day acquiring a dream, and for the recognition itself. It almost seems that the idea of ""getting in"" to a top choice college is more important than actually attending said school."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The heady days of Vietnam War protests and spontaneous beat poetrybreakouts at America's colleges are long gone. Gone with them are the days ofblasé sexual promiscuity and the legendary 'Summers of Love,' the drug-infestedoases of the young and restless. The 'rebel without a cause' has vanished fromour collegiate midst, leaving behind him a trail of ambiguity and, perhaps, acertain tedium to the nation's collective image of the college experience."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The elevator finally gets to my floor. I get off and start walking down the hall to my dorm room. As I pass room 402, I hear Akon being blasted on the stereo, room 404 has their daily porn playing on their flat screen TV, and the two girls living in 406 are glued to the television watching Jerry Springer. I inch my way towards my room and hear All You Need is Love. I must have forgot to turn off my music before heading to class. When I open my door, I'm greeted by my Woodstock poster and my tapestry of elephants and peace signs that stretches across my wall. My dad always tells me I should have been in college in the 1960's or 70's. I think he's right."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Why am I writing this essay? As I sit here, I am cursing myself for allowing my mom to persuade me to compose a response. In reality, I don't really have an opinion about Mr. Perlstein's assessment of college today. That, I believe, is the answer to the question. My apathy towards Mr. Perlstein's essay is in itself, the best example of how college has changed. A politically, culturally, and socially involved college student might find the article appalling and say that Mr. Perlstein is wrong, delusional even. I wish I could agree but I believe that I have just proven that Mr. Perlstein has ""hit the nail on the head"", so to speak."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The understanding of why college matters lies somewhere in the reasoning of my eligibility for this contest. As an eighteen year old high school graduate, my future lies in the disorienting fog of a deferred college admission. I will attend school in the fall of 2008, so while I may be technically enrolled in a college, my status as ""college student"" and thus my eligibility in this circumstance come into question. I find myself in a limbo of sorts, where for once in my life my future is conditional on the fact that I do nothing. My Freudian slip, ""nothing,"" reveals something interesting though, about our understanding of education, for the slip is hardly individual; it's national. We find ourselves in the classic conundrum in which education is directly proportional to one's time in school. In accordance with this logic, for someone like myself in an academic gap, my education is on pause and I can actively do ""nothing."" But I have begun to realize that my upcoming time before college is a far cry from a year off; I have a year ""on."" And suddenly the burden of free time has become much heavier: my deferred admission is conditional on the fact that I do everything. That's the way we ought to understand it. College student - I do not know. But I'd like to consider myself a student at least, for I hope my education endures even when my presence in school does not."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I've heard that question a thousand times, put to me by a thousand older questioners, most of them aging hipster baby-boomers about to go on a long rant about the good old days. Oh, and how sad it is the current generation is not having the same experiences, as though the change they lobbied so hard for should be reversed for us. Furthermore, they never tell me what people ""my age"" are supposed to be caring about. About the war in Iraq? About gay marriage? About the world? We do care about all those things. The problem is that we haven't seen any results. Even with all those protests and sit-ins, the Vietnam conflict continued for a few years before the government finally listened. No one seems to be listening to us, either. We do protest. We participate in the day of silence, or we don't go to class for a day to protest the anti-immigration laws. We sign petitions. We give a minute for the environment, whatever that means. Maybe it's not as concentrated an effort as ""back in the day,"" but it still doesn't seem like anyone's listening."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"""Sweet acceptance!"" A glitch in Barnard College's admissionsprocess had allowed me to view a page only for accepted students aweek or so before I received the thick envelope in the mail. Ielatedly hugged my boyfriend, my parents, and my brother. I wasswept with the euphoric feeling of a job well done. I had beenrunning for so long, finally the finish-line was in sight.Throughout my high school career, I had garnered the right awards,won the prestigious internship, studied hard to acquire a high GPA,and spent my Saturdays at courses ranging from Mandarin Chinese toSAT prep. My hard work had paid off and I could relax on anIvy-League campus with my intellectual peers. My freshman year atcollege, however, quickly revealed that I couldn't slow my pacequite yet. I would have to do just the opposite."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"As far as progressives go, my street cred it impeccable. I was brought up in a hippie enclave, took part in a high school activist group, and ended up at one of the most left-leaning universities in the country. Needless to say, my upbringing took place under the tenet that the 1960s was the golden standard: an era in which progressive ideals were fulfilled and consummated on college quads and in city streets. This was a time that we-those not fortunate enough to have been born in the baby boom-could only seek to emulate. To me, those who challenged the post-war status quo (and not their parents) constituted the real 'greatest generation,' and it is with some shock and consternation that my belief has recently been unsettled. With this realization my politics and even- hackneyed as this may sound-my elemental social mooring has been dislodged."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Heading off into the world of four-year self-discovery, I found a visceral thrill in the idea of dramatic, late-night dorm debates. In the first month of college, I lived off of the intellectual excitement I found on the back porch of my freshman dorm. Twenty of us would gather around midnight, with Mountain Dew and cigarettes, arguing passionately about cultural oppression, the death penalty, and alternative rock bands. I fired off hyper emails to my mother, telling her I had ""actually experienced those great college conversations"" like she had once had. I was addicted to my new atmosphere and all the gloriously divergent opinions."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"It was a long standing dream of George Washington's to create an institution for higher education within the boundaries of the nation's capital. His dream, as lofty as it was, was realized in 1820 with the creation of the Columbian College in the District of Columbia. President Washington envisioned an establishment at which students from across the country could study politics and the principles of governing. The name of the institution was changed to The George Washington University in 1904, and now hosts more than 19,000 undergraduate and graduate students. Washington's dream, some may say, has become a great success."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I do not encourage people to apply to my university. It's a great school, I always say, but it has its problems. The food is terrible, financial aid is so-so, and the people from New Jersey think I'm from South Carolina. As a college student who does not varnish truths or exude enthusiasm without questioning, I believe that after two years I know enough to honestly reflect on the experience."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Before I begin, I have the intense need to clarify ""college experience"", for it is a poor synonym for what is at stake. Stripped to its bare bones, it can be broken down into something that civilizations through the ages can recognize and identify with: knowledge, power and freedom. Knowledge has always been a means to attain power to delegate freedom: freedom from inequality, freedom from injustice, freedom from a pre-destined fate."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Change...it is inevitable in any and every society; history in itself is testament to that fact. But in today's American system of higher education it is not the numerous colleges and universities who are at fault for Rick Perlstein's argument that ""college as America used to understand it is coming to an end."" Rather, it is the students."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Let's create something! This is what college means to me. There has to be something to the fact that some of the most popular courses at my school are in the creative writing department, that the highest profile clubs are not concerned with politics but with the arts. In college, we're always making things. We edit magazines, we write poetry; we choreograph and dance, we draw and paint. We do this all the time. We are nearly obsessed with building something all our own. But there is more to this: we are engaged in the manufacture of optimism."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"One night last spring, in a nightclub outside of Kharkov, techno music blared, strobe lights flashed, blonde Eastern European women lither than I can ever hope to be gyrated. Around 1:30, the DJ cranked up the opening chords of Pink Floyd's 1979 classic, ""Another Brick in the Wall."" My friends and I, visiting Ukraine as part of a fellowship program for Jewish college students, were ecstatic. As we sang along with Roger Waters' most famous line (""We don't need no education "") my friend Aviva suddenly began jumping up and down, hand above her head in that fake-defiant pop-punk gesture popularized by Good Charlotte and other middle-school-friendly rock bands. ""Yeah!"" she shouted. ""We go to school!"""
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein is right; college has changed. It no longer resembles the images of 1960's university life he recalls in his essay. We do not have celebrities crashing in our dorm rooms, or if we do, they are of the reality-tv rather than the revolutionary variety. To modern high-school graduates, college does not offer much in the way of new ideas or new philosophies. No one I know has ever discovered themselves in their first reading of a banned book. But this is not to say that college is no longer a time of discovery."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Going to the annual conference of ACLU of the State of Illinois with a bunch of my friends was a very interesting experience. I really enjoyed hearing about civil liberties issues in the State and what the ACLU of Illinois had done about them or was planning to do about them in the coming year. However, something at the conference really bugged me. Everyone there kept complimenting my friends and I for being unusually politically active, always immediately followed by grumbling about how college has generally gone to hell-in-a-hand-basket, and how in their day my activist friends and I wouldn't be the exception, but the rule. They blathered on about activism in the 60's, how they had fought against censorship and a war they thought was unjust, and how today college students just don't care anymore. I think that they, along with many other aging liberals, suffer from the same problem in their thinking. That is to say that they don't realize it isn't the 60's anymore. The 1960s were a very special time in American cultural history. Young people begin to break away from traditional cultural norms, exploring sex and drugs and reactionary politics. This, coupled with the political atmosphere at the time ""overshadowed by the controversial Vietnam War and a government that tried to suppress many forms of thought"" created an explosive situation. It was cool to rebel, to do things just because there were counter to the way that things had been done before. Pop-culture on college campuses was all about sticking it to the man, and there was a saying ""never trust anyone over thirty."""
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"This is a story about an institution called Liberal Arts College, the ideals it promised to live by and the people that were selected to fulfill those ideals.

This is a story about how the protagonists were defeated by the antagonists."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein's article ""What's the Matter with College"" pissed me off. It really pissed me off. It pissed me off because I found it particularly condescending. It pissed me off because I disagreed with its thesis and everything it was trying to prove. But mostly it pissed me off because I wasn't in it."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,Last year was a busy year on campus. Students challenged the limits of the University's anti-discrimination clause. They voiced their disapproval of a commencement speaker who helped start a war. A disapproving administrator discarded thousands of copies of the independent student newspaper. Allegations of a hate crime escalated racial tensions.
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"For days and days after reading this article I was unable to respond to it with anything more thinking than ""I'm not having it, Mr. Perlstein. You just leave my college-going generation alone, thank you."" As a senior entering my emotionally charged last year, I was antagonized by the author's smug reminiscences, the those-were-the-days attitude that every younger-than person is bound to resent. By his eagerness to declare the mass disaffection of undergrads and the soullessness of the system based on some ""stories"" from his grouchy U of C informant. I was considerably miffed. Somehow I have not been infantilized or brainwashed into market-speak by the college machine, yet have managed to enjoy college in my own way. I resent any imprecations against it--especially as I near the end, and everything college related becomes amber-tinted and sacred. I don't need some nostalgic reporter belittling what everyone keeps telling me is ""the best time of my life."""
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"When Ted Kennedy eulogized his brother, Robert Kennedy, on June 8 of 1968, the entire country seems it was at some precise and critical age; some sort of collective youth, when everyone was either growing up and changing or being left in the past. Kennedy's speech is terribly sad, no question, but beneath the personal mourning that he was feeling, there's a sense of something bigger. Mr. Kennedy includes in his eulogy a section of one of his brother's speeches that so correctly characterizes a feeling of inevitable change that to read it now is disappointing:"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Whether college is more or less critical to the nation than it was a generation ago depends on who you ask, so the best way for me to approach the question is to describe how critical my college experience has been to me. I think that although the keys to the kingdom of college have survived the generations, the doors seem to have moved; where _Tropic of Capricorn_ may have gotten Doug Mitchell into college in the 1960's, I maintain that Henry Miller's other _Tropic_ saved me from it. I discovered _Tropic of Cancer_ in the summer of 2005, when two years of bewildering social and intellectual impotence at the University of Pittsburgh had left me frustrated and misplaced. I had run from high school to college in the earnest pursuit of truth, but had not to stay long before worrying that maybe in spite of my hunger for knowledge, I was not the university type after all. Although I initially flew at college with the intensity of a laser beam, a quick ""Freshman Studies"" brainwashing on the value of a ""liberal arts education"" was all it took to scatter the force of my curiosity on impact. I had been anxious to jump right in and see what Philosophy was all about, but my advisers at Pitt, operating under a liberal arts theory, prescribed intellectually dilute yet logistically overwhelming schedules for underclassmen - a tight regimen of dabbling - that I think prevented me from ever really taking root in the Philosophy Department. I can't say it was all bad; I did put some solid work into English, for example, which was a critical step in establishing my academic direction. But two years is a long time to feel like an outsider in one's major department, and when those beaming study-abroad veterans regaled my foreign language class with tales of life-changing journeys of self-discovery overseas, I considered study abroad not only as a temporary escape from my frustrations, but as an opportunity to see how Philosophy worked at another university. So, passing over the glossy pamphlets advertising Pitt-affiliated abroad programs, I opted instead for a direct enrollment with University College London."

The event marks the culmination of a child's long and arduous pathway to adulthood which includes stressful Saturday mornings spent filling in bubbles with a sharpened number two pencil, the dreadfully agonizing college essay, the resume, and teacher recommendations for ten different college applications or more. Although most American teenagers want to spend their nights watching American idol and chatting on America online, getting into college is considered the most important characteristic of a young adult in many high pressure school districts across the country."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"How does one define the ""college experience""? Is it constant studying and sleepless nights spent cramming for tomorrow's test? Is it simply a social experience where good grades are ancillary to partying? Is it a time where experimentation and self-expression leave permanent impressions on the way we make future decisions? Weave all these questions together and the resulting tangled web is the essence of the college experience. It is a time and place where balance and free-thought, diversity and change, and escape and enlightenment mesh together to complete the puzzle that is our character. With college life now defined, Is the college experience less critical to the nation than it was a generation ago? The answer is no. It is more critical."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"""Free at last, free at last! Thank God almighty, we are free at last!"" My apropos usage of Martin Luther King Jr's famous quotation to describe leaving for college may be clichéd, hackneyed, and slightly irresponsible. But I didn't care at the time. I celebrated my emancipation from tyrannical African parents until my first paper was assigned. After which, I settled into college life. Ah, college! Three years ago, an eager, younger version of myself left my parent's house hating the school I was driving to but happy for the change in scenery. My family is originally from Ghana, and if there's one truth every child of African parents knows, it's that you're wrong. Although during my high school senior year I had decided on entering a small liberal arts college, my parents coerced me into attending the state university where my father taught. Coercion doesn't fully describe it. My parents conducted a battle of ideological (yelling) and financial attrition until I resigned myself to the school of my nightmares. Two years later, I would transfer to Vanderbilt University."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"When Mr. Perlstein speaks of the ""college experience,"" it's hard for me to know exactly which one he's referring to. I'm one of 18 million students enrolled in over 4200 colleges. I have a feeling, though, that he's not talking about the 46% of college students who are enrolled in community colleges. He's talking about an alienated suburban kid's paradise, not an industrious inner city kid's escape from the streets, a first- generation kid's new frontier, or a fresh start for parents who hadn't gone to college ""back when it was college."""
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"When I was choosing what college to attend four years ago, a politically active campus was a characteristic that I found extraordinarily appealing. Attracted to the idea of protests every weekend and intellectual debates in dorm rooms every night, it was little surprise when I selected Lewis & Clark College - ranked by the Princeton Review as one of the most politically active campuses in the country. By the time I arrived, I was pleasantly relieved to see other freshman thinking alike."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I believe that the so called life altering experiences you are supposed to experience in college are now over with. In fact, the generation gap that we have all been waiting for in the education system has finally occurred. There was a time where college was an option. An individual could go into the workforce, could join an armed force, OR go to college. However, as time has passed, there now is the recognition of education. Where companies that once may have given a direct chance towards a high school graduate fifty years ago must now make sure that these individuals, people like myself, have a college degree along with in-job experience."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Not that a caveat would have helped any, but having the seat of my soul kicked over while my brain and heart were impounded all of freshman year might have been an easier ordeal if someone had told me, for example, to pack a stuffed animal."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Faster. Smarter. Better? In one day a student can race across campus from class to class, surf the 'net for the latest in peace talks and pop culture, save the world and the whales at a local non-profit organization, and call a friend back home in the 'spare' time left over. At first, this day sounds productive and enriching but something profound is missing...connection. Despite the varied benefits of technology and a high speed life, the modern wonders of western culture have stolen deep human association from much of college life."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The University of California, Berkeley, has a reputation for being a liberal and politically active place. It has certainly been the site for many nascent movements that later captured the nation's attentions. The most notable of these is the Free Speech Movement that began in 1964 with a mass demonstration in Sproul Plaza."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In this brief sentence I believe that Mr. Perlstein accuratelyassesses the changing, perhaps already changed, nature of the ""collegeexperience"" and the role it is perceived as playing in theintellectual and social advancement of the college student. He isundoubtably right in realizing the tides are changing; we need onlylook at the social and political environment of the previous eras inwhich men like Doug Mitchell attended college to see the disparitiesin social perception and life experience between the college youth of,for example, the sixties, and the college youth of today. Mitchell'swas a time of social upheaval, when America and its children werequesting for a new identity and an opportunity to improve the world;it was indeed the liberal hour during which the faith thatintellectual idealism and political progressivism held the key to thefuture of humanity ran rampant. Colleges at the time were, of course,intimately linked to this phenomenon, and served as incubators forbudding intellectuals and safe-havens for political theorizing anddebate. Today, we live in a very different social climate, one inwhich faith in the government has greatly dwindled, and dwindlesstill, and a certain mixture of fear and paranoia have cast aparalyzing shadow over the sunny progressivism of days now gone by.Disillusionment with the two-party system, or at least with the twoparties themselves, widely publicized government fiascos and scandal,floundering support for the president, and fear of disturbing worldrealities like terrorism have created a situation where people haveinsulated themselves from the realm of external world affairs,""Politics"" and all it entails. Others have cynically decided that, forthem, opportunism and not philanthropy promises to be the mostfulfilling of philosophies. This I think, is integral to understandingthe circumstances of the change. If the average college student nowgrows up in an environment where political expression andphilosophical cultivation is much less encouraged, he or she willreflect that, and the old perception of American colleges as hotbedsof political activism will come to be outdated. This being so, thequestions remain ""What is the nature and consequence of this change?""and ""What is the perceived role of college now for most students?"""
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"It became a sanctuary. I sat on the floor with all the appropriate paperwork and books surrounding me in a large circle, placing myself in the center of everything. I did it almost unconsciously, flipping through the college guidebooks that had become my treasure maps, my compass to Shangri-la. I only looked for small schools, for big castle-like buildings, a teacher ratio of 10 to 1, and lots and lots of trees. I wanted a college version of my California high school where some students did not wear shoes, boys grew their hair long, and teachers lay out in the grass eating their vegetarian lunches. In December of my senior year of high school I imagined college to be this haven of intellectual stimulation where everyone drinks coffee and mulls over the meaning of life."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein's conclusions about college in the United States today as compared to the 1960s, drawn from conversations with a handful of students at the University of Chicago, the school where, purportedly, ""fun goes to die,"" are not false, but they fail to tell the truth. Perlstein claims that the college experience ""has begun to disappear,"" that ""[college] as America used to understand it is coming to end,"" but doesn't acknowledge the other side of the equation. He mentions the Internet only briefly in the essay, but the topic is in dire need of further exploration. ""College,"" as Perlstein considers the subject, has disappeared because the energy that fueled it has found a new outlet via technology. This new center for communication, information, and power has certainly redirected the energy of the social conscience on campus, but to best understand the shift, one first has to look at some of the historical currents that have shaped the last half-century."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Finally comes a point in life where you can truly be whoever you want to be--a time to start fresh. College presented this new beginning to me and for that I can never really understand people's dissatisfactions with it. Certainly you can draw out the experience until it only hinders you, and surely you can attend a place under your parents' restrictions. But the difference with college is that you know beforehand that there are only a certain number of years to experience it (whether it be two, four, or more in graduate school) and that yields the components to a period of discovery."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"A nippy answer to a particular question is always appealing. To the challenge what's the matter with college, even Yoda could quickly convince you in a blink with one of his babblings: the nature of its current existence cloaks its presence . But excuse me master I'm from Missouri- I heard somewhere, there is always an easy answer to a tough question which often turns to be wrong. Would be this the case? Coins have two sides, but in describing just one, Mr. Perlstein seems to get the upper hand in the prognosis of present college affairs. A broader look on the casus belli is therefore desired."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"People are inevitably shaped by the times they live in and Generation Y is no exception to this rule. Today's college students are certainly filled with great passion and potential. The element that's changed, however, is the role of college in today's society."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"On May 4th, 1970, four Kent State students were shot in a confrontation with the Ohio National Guard. The students were protestors; some were no more than passers by. They had all gathered together to act upon their right granted by the United States Constitution to demonstration against the politics which they as Americans disagreed with: the Nixon Administrations planned invasion of Cambodia. The shootings forever changed Kent State, as well as altered the many lives impacted by that day."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Every April, I freak out. Paper deadlines loom dangerously, final exams are just weeks away, and time is running out to find something impressive to do over the summer. Each night, I retreat to my nook in the library, armed with the usual end-of-semester paraphernalia: laptop, granola bars, notes to be spread out and piled high. I wonder how on earth the year passed by so quickly, and vow not to let anything, not even the warmth of early spring, distract me from my last chances at good grades. But on an unusually frigid Monday last April, when I should have been seated in a seminar room discussing Mary Wollstonecraft's feminist thought, I was at Boston's Heartbreak Hill, scanning the Boston Marathon crowd for my friends Becca and Sophia. They didn't mind when I initially said I'd be unable to cheer them on, understanding not only that April is a high-stress month, but also that I'm a high-stress person. However, our friends Stephanie, Dave, and Greg, all much nicer and less nerdy than I am, were going to Boston, and, following a moment of weakness, I was on board, too, though not without reservations. It was one of the most un-me things I'd ever done, cutting class in April, and I couldn't quite believe I was actually doing it until I got off the Greyhound at South Station, heavy with guilt."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"When my schoolmates scattered across America to continue their educations and I stayed in Georgia, unbeknownst to me I became the homeward bound hub of summer break - a helpless observer to the breakdown of the American higher education system. Did my friends develop intellectually? Advance academically or grow socially? They came back caricatures of their former selves - convinced, confident, happy, well-adjusted, brimming with potential, eager for the ""real world,"" and deeply uneducated."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I am in college now, so there is a low probability that I was born in the 1960's. Each decade is remembered by particular traits. Along with the psychedelic movement and funky age, the 1960's was known for youthful radicalism. Obviously in many decades that have come by, the ""bone of contention in elections have differed."" I do not think it is peculiar this time around."" Maybe the college experience is less critical to the nation than it was a generation ago. I believe the factors leading to these changes are natural and not a deliberate action. The issue of terrorism, the phenomenon of celebrities and probably the internet are some natural causes."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"To think that MTV or society could pose a question that has such a broad answer. What's The Matter With College? It all just depends on who you ask and his/her upbringing. One must also keep in mind that college in itself is not a liberty freely given to everyone in society as a whole. Instead of asking What's The Matter With College, we should be asking what's the matter with society? A society that's so caught up in itself that it fails to see the bigger picture, not to stray away from the original question but to shed light on the bigger problem. College or universities were institutions designed to nurture creative thought and thinking to insure success in an ever changing world. To give birth to the brightest minds, intellects, and entrepreneurs. What purpose does college truly serve today, how are college grads bringing about overall change, what drives a individual to pursue a degree and how is his/her degree utilized to bring about change. Only when an individual answers these questions will he/she be able to answer WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH COLLEGE?"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"By the time I had finally mailed off my final application, I held such a passionate disdain for the general realm of college admissions that I almost felt bitter towards my acceptance letters. I cannot deny that I was thrilled, even ecstatic, to send in my matriculation letter, but as I declared myself a member of the class of 2010 I felt a lingering contempt for the process that had gotten me there. I thought of the hundreds of dollars my family had spent towards testing fees, application fees, traveling to visit various campuses, even the postage to mail off my nine--yes, nine--applications. It all felt like a waste."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,Logging Onto College
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The college experience is much more critical to the nation today than it was years ago. My mom always tells me, ""You don't know how lucky you are to be able to go to college."" My mother, Antoinette Sanfilippo, a 1976 high school graduate was born to an immigrant family that could not afford to send her or her siblings to college and if wasn't for the Navy paying his tuition, my father wouldn't have been able to attend college either. My father like many people years ago, had a passion for school. He worked hard and went to school at night. In the past, fewer people went to college because they could not afford it. Today more jobs require a college degree than years ago and as a result of our expanding global market place, there is more money available for people to get a degree. These days college is so important because so much emphasis is placed on a degree and we are competing in an environment that goes across the world."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"College is only as much as students make of it. The cultural experiences found on many campuses cannot be absorbed by osmosis, but must be attended to be appreciated. Though I have many peers who seek both intellectual and cultural fulfillment at school, there is also a large group who seem to be missing the point. Grades, test scores, and class standing have become the primary concerns of the American college student. More and more, knowledge that cannot be found in a classroom, and events that most campuses are rich with go unsought. Students are too busy holed up in the library, cramming four years of learning into three, just so they can get into the workplace faster. Now that higher education has become directly linked with a fatter paycheck, and money is becoming synonymous with happiness, America is losing its grasp on what college is supposed to be. At this time, I believe that the true college experience is more critical than ever."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"""All I really need to know I learned in kindergarten."" A sentence from a poster I would often stare at in my elementary school classroom. Of course at the time, I actually was in kindergarten, and interpreted the poster to mean I wouldn't learn anything useful after kindergarten. In fact, as I went through my elementary years the words and their implications became even more confusing to me. How could this poster actually be suggesting that every year of schooling after kindergarten was just sort of extra? Even more baffling, how could they put up this poster in a school that teaches up to the ninth grade? If the poster was indeed telling the truth, then why did high school matter?"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein claims that the problem with college is the lack of a ""generation gap."" Is he serious? I am not trying to disrespect him, but that couldn't be father from the truth. Life will always have generation gaps. That's the way life is. 21 years ago, as I was just a twinkle in my mom's eye, the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was released into some test markets, with many skeptical retailers. Now I can see just how much sweat is pouring off of Shaq's forehead when I'm shooting free throws on my Playstation 3. He mentions an account of a girl who talks to her dad for 15 minutes on her cell phone and how college students used to dread talking to their parents, trying to distance themselves as much as possible. Maybe it is just me, but that is a perfect example of a generation gap. But yet he claims that's the problem with college. No gap from the students and their parents. My parents don't try to like the same things I do, just simply want to be informed on what their son or daughter is up to. I didn't realize it was a problem to keep in touch with my parents, especially now in a world were I can be reached on my own cell phone, not something my parents had in college, by letter or even better by e-mail. He is kidding himself if he doesn't see a generational gap because it's laughing at him."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Growing up, we were bombarded with images of college life and the importance of higher education. By eighteen, we developed expectations and set standards for ourselves far beyond the expectations and standards that our parents faced upon entering adulthood. The modern application process alone forced us to thoroughly assess ourselves and our long-term goals. As if this wasn't enough, we evaluated our own strengths, weaknesses, and dreams, in light of those of our peers, and perhaps even manipulated them, so that we might have a chance, just a chance, at being considered for admission to a competitive university. Most of us were fortunate enough to have had the emotional and financial support of our parents to brace us through the process; however, the average parent is incapable of pulling enough strings to secure a successful future for his or her child. College goers of today must accept a reality that is unfamiliar to our parents: Brains and determination, alone, cannot guarantee success. However, also unlike our parents, we do not take no for an answer."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Why college matters? Why college matters? That's like asking Michelangelo why painting matters or asking Shakespeare why metaphors matter: it's not like there's a single, tangible reason -or even a number of reasons, for that matter -yet everyone who experiences it knows it's true. The fact is, college doesn't ""matter"" in such a way that words might properly explain it; such an explanation would depend on images and sounds our puny little alphabet will never capture, on emotions of unknown quality and magnitude that our language hasn't invented words for, and on friendships that our stupid clich?s like ""lasting a lifetime"" make a mockery of."

She's going to be a doctor. The conversation was typical for newly acquainted college colleagues and the initial questions are banal: what's my major? I tell her. She becomes silent for a bit, and then says, ""English. I never understood why people who go to your school decide to study English.""I've heard this one before."

Granted, I am a whole (read: short) nine months away from graduating from college (and thus have yet to attend one of these myself), but from the way undergrads are speedily ushered off campus after the last final exams to provide enough time for the school to prepare for the annual celebration, it seems like a pretty big deal. So why all the fuss? Members of the Class of '83 might argue that we college kids will understand when we celebrate our 25th Reunion. They might say that we just don't get it, because in this fast-paced, internet-and-technology overloaded generation we can't appreciate the fact that most people lose touch after four years at the same school, that thanks to the likes of Facebook.com, we'll never really experience wondering what Harsha or Osei are up to these days because we'll have been able to check their profiles all along."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In today's society there is constant pressure from every conceivable angle to achieve. So much of that emphasis is focused on the individual's ability to compete in an increasingly competitive marketplace; tragically, because of this the individual's ability to understand their position in life has become obsolete. However, there is a beacon of hope for the youth of today, and that guiding light is called college. Higher education is the last bastion for the future leaders of America, a place where a person can gain a true awareness of their place in life, both politically, and personally."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Of course colleges aren't the same as they were in the late 60's, if they were they would truly be dead--anything that can exist that long without change defies the definition of a living organism. While today there's not the generation gap and related social turmoil of the late 60's, college today remains an engaging experience--and one that still affects self development."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Even before Mr. Perlstein's adroit ""What's the Matter with College?"" had me racking my brain over the cultural significance of colleges in America, he had me laughing, and for such an inviting gesture--intended or not--many thanks are due. After all, one cannot help but find the sweetest hilarity in imagining Ronald Reagan's voyeuristic encounter with a ""vile"" sexual orgy. Though Reagan does not expressly assert his encounter with California 's collegiate bacchanalia, his fetid description leads one to believe that he must have engaged in the visual reception of a wild party or two. Perhaps he just watched a tape."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"As I sit and consider the college experience and its relevance, I find myself consistently returning to the conversation that always accompanied the infrequent visits with my father's childhood home. ""This was always my motivation. Leaving this,"" he would utter wistfully glancing toward the decrepit one story house situated on an overcrowded street in the unsightly urban landscape of a small blue-collar city in New Jersey. My father grew up as one of four children in a lower class family, markedly distanced from the luxuries that act to define much of my existence. After high school, my father attended Trinity College, a small liberal arts school in Hartford, CT before moving on to Tufts Medical School and becoming a dermatologist. My father's story is certainly not unique; in fact, it is commonplace. The story of his higher education is a mere exemplar of class ascension as a result of work ethic and perseverance. The reason for mentioning my father is simple; it is a stark counterexample to today's environment."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Why does college matter? As I read through the New York Times Magazine article, What's the Matter with College, written by Rick Perlstein, I found that the answer to this question would be more difficult to explain than it would be to uncover. In fact, there is no definitive explanation, and there can never be one. Still, there is an obvious trend that cannot be ignored: students are apparently more pacified now than they were during the Vietnam era."

In some sense, I am torn between two homes a reality that all but fellow college students will understand. Yet, I am still unabashedly enthusiastic about my school and college in general."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"My parents, quintessential baby boomers, were the ones storming the administrative buildings, hoping their draft numbers weren't going to be called and holding up signs at dozens of rallies. That spirit of activism, and the soapbox that college provided them, is long gone. We can mourn the loss of the ""good old days,"" because yes, college in that sense no longer exists. I still have yet to start my freshman year, and I can confidently say my college experience will be, thankfully, wholly unlike that of my parents'. Today, college is radically different, but not altogether worse. I think my generation is, on the surface, plagued with more ""apathy"" than our parents', but as young, rebellious adults, we certainly still care."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Ask ten people what college evoked in the 1960s, and the majority will allude to the notion of ""revolution"".

He was surely one of those children who entered school at the age of three and never looked back, especially not to reminisce over naptime.

For a liberal arts college, U.S. News and World Report agrees with me. Williams is widely recognized as offering what is possibly the best undergraduate experience of any school, if something like that can be measured. The school's alumni are faithful for life. Some even move back to the area as adults. I can personally vouch for the quality of instruction, the excellent support system for incoming students, and most importantly to me, the caliber of students that Williams attracts. The young men and women that I have met are all truly extraordinary, and I feel lucky to be among them. Everyone is smart, talented, driven, and even alarmingly athletic, especially for someone like me who cannot understand why anyone would enjoy jogging. We are some of the best, the dream team, who all gather in one place to learn, and to learn from each other."

For me, graduation was merely the day to step through the portal from undergraduate land into the real world. At our ceremony, we didn't even throw our caps. After talking to friends from other colleges, it seemed their graduations shared the same lackluster appeal of my own at the University of Scranton. The only exception I can think of is New York University, where I saw a newspaper photograph of seniors following in the post-graduation tradition of jumping in the fountain."

Perhaps these students have discovered the importance of a college experience."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I have no memory of the 1960's and the '70's. These tumultuous years bear significant meaning to generations that went before me; yet, the decade lives on with its oldies classics, lunar missions, Vietnamization, and civil rights struggle. One way or another, everyone is captured through the Austin Powers throwbacks, English discussions of The Kind of Light that Shines on Texas, or history readings of two important, yet short-lived presidencies. Back then,the new millennium was anything left to the imagination of those who studied hard and led America to success in recent years. Nowadays, the sixties are more or less the imagination of us college students. If there was ever an adage to come true, it was that history tends to repeat itself."

Instead, colleges these days are brimming with kids who, rather than asking the fundamental questions of humanity, obsess about how they are going to fit into the economy after graduation. This is the sordid state of college in America nowadays. According to Rick Perlstein, anyway. But does his depiction reflect reality? Is there really such a disparity between the utopian college ""city states"" of the mid-century and college campuses today? I think not."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"We are forced to make plans for our futures before we even know who we are. Upon graduation from middle school we start typing up all the activities. By sophomore year in High School it's expected we know our top four college choices , and by junior year our major. As the high school student is continuosly pumped with mandatory community service hours, eclectic experiences, and varsity sports ,he's left with out air. It's his own air that he lacks, the genuine desires that lie underneath the college performance."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"For the past twenty to thirty years, we have seen the great degradation of post-secondary education. Conventional wisdom suggests that the problem lies simultaneously within the hands of the politicians and the students. This narrative does not account for the history of college. Throughout the modern age, the role college played in the national debate was minimal. To this date, there has only been one president with a Ph.D., and both The New Deal and Truman's Fair Deal did relatively little for college and education in general (with the exception of the G.I. Bill). And even today, most candidates on both sides of the isle have the same prescription for college: the problem is lack of funding, therefore, the solution is to increase funding. It usually ends at that."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I confess that I did not want to go to college. As high school graduation loomed ahead in bold blue-ink letters on my agenda, I saw myself being forced into the college machine: where I would be flattened, packaged, and neatly bound for a nine to five job with pension some day. I saw college as the end to any burgeoning hopes I might have had of swimming against the mainstream. They told me that in college I would learn to think. I took it to mean I would learn to think how they wanted me to: they being the brown blazer sporting, briefcase toting day-shift professors."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In, ""What's the Matter With College?"" by Rick Perlstein, he asks, ""Why does student life no longer seem important? Well I have my own reactions to why this seems so, and I will also explain why college is still very important, but it is not the defining factor in our society today. To compare the college generation today to the college generations of the 1960s and 1970s is to compare two different eras, two different cultures, and two very different citizens of The United States. As a current student at Rutgers University, The State School of New Jersey in the information age I willingly and unwillingly make decisions everyday based on the era in which I lived. My fellow college students and I are constantly connected to the people we interact with. Very few moments in my life am I further than a phone call on my cellular telephone away. Previous generations have not had that luxury; there was a time difference with uncertainty because of the delay of communication. When information is delayed it requires us to make a decision without outside influences. Within the college community the quest for knowledge is no longer verbally transmitted to the extent it once was. The forum to display views is now on the internet. Even television today is not an open communication, what is received by our television and eventually by its patrons is decided by major corporations with their own political agendas."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Perlstein's essay, What's the Matter with College?, is as much aeulogy for the long-dead university climate of past decades as it isan indictment of the mainstream, career-focusedconstipation-of-the-soul he observes in higher learning today. Hehas a point: the freedom he experienced from the first day of classeshas now largely been supplanted by structure and oversight, advisorsand RAs. Yet something about the anecdotes Perlstein uses to paintthese respective pictures, about the questions he does not ask andthe people he does not mention, strikes me as overly selective. I'mtempted to use the word privileged - and four years of hearing thatword both thoughtlessly thrown about to discredit others andreflexively dismissed as politically-correct drivel have taught menot to do so lightly. Perlstein scoffs at the ""banal new reality""that one can now find alternative culture and like-minded radicalsthrough the Internet, without having to wait until college. Whatabout his less fortunate contemporaries who never had the chance toattend college? Would they really have thought such an opportunitybanal? In fact, one look at the forces driving the cultural shift oncampus and I have to suspect that the brotherhood of rebels andsubversives Perlstein remembers only ever existed for a lucky few."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"""College as America used to understand it is coming to an end""... and good riddance I say. Mr. Perlstein pushes this quote as a thesis within his commentary. And guess what? It gives off an extremely negative connotation. His piece is after all titled, ""What's the Matter with College?"" and goes on to suggest that contemporary students have a bad case of intellectual impotence. While I agree with Mr. Perlstein in his point that the perception of college in America is changing, what I disagree with is his argument- that the result of this is something to lament. The decline of higher education's effect on the national culture is actually giving way to something much more significant, a growing consciousness that enables discussion rather than demonstration."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"For Americans and the 1960's and '70's, there is no middle ground; one either defends these years as a golden age of youth culture growing up or denigrates them as the beginning of the end of America, American values, and civilization itself."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Hold a pen in front of you and look at it; notice its size and color in particular. Now, slowly move it away until you have your arm fully extended. Notice anything different? Probably not, and that is how it should be. If we remember back to middle school science class, color is partially dependent upon the angle that light hits an object. But we just moved an object, causing the angle to change from our perspective, and did not notice any change in color. The pen also moved further away without any apparent change in size. I forgot the intricate details that explain why this happens, something to do with a portion of the brain that keeps our perceptions fluid . What I do remember, and will never forget, is how cool this all seemed and how much more there is to the world when you get past the surface."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Centralized. Passionate. Influential. The powerful descriptors of a monumental generation: the Baby Boomers. This definitive generation had the opportunity to experience something their predecessors had not, something novel and free: college. Through their experiences of mind expansion by multiple means, this generation resurrected American society by assuming an active role, a centralized role according to Rick Perlstein in his essay 'What's the Matter With College?', during the turbulent era of the '60s and '70s. But college has seemed to have lost that centrality, that former fervor, according to Perlstein; this is not so. Before one can lead one must follow, our generation just seems to be scraping the back of the previous generation's heels a little sooner than expected."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In the past two years that I have attended Columbia University, I have stood by and witnessed student activist behavior that spanned a spectrum going from the relatively tame, to downright strange. The traditional Op-Eds and sponsored discussions on the war in Iraq and immigration were utilized, but there has also been a violent interruption of a guest-speaker's speech, an organized call for a student walk-out, and even, in a quirky turn of events, a fifty foot, phallus shaped, inflatable nuclear bomb that mysteriously plopped down in the center of campus one morning this past spring."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"""You usually know who you are by the time you're in college."" At least, that's what my professor said as he stood at the front of the classroom. I disagreed--adamantly."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In the Fall of 2002, University of Chicago student activists--some dressed as tomatoes--marched across their campus. The event was part of the ""Boot the Bell"" campaign, which sought to remove Taco Bell from the campus cafeteria. Taco Bell's principal tomato supplier stood accused of exploiting migrant farm workers, paying them sub-poverty wages and providing no benefits. U of C students from the student-run Anti-Sweatshop Coalition worked tirelessly to raise awareness and lobby the administration. After months of work, culminating with the tomato-march, Taco Bell lost its contract."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"College as a higher education institution is critical to the individual student and to the nation as a whole but, the ""college experience"" is of much lesser value than it was in the 1960's and 1970's. Today, the college student is more competitive; career focused and has a different agenda for their education than they had in the past. Students now are taught by the very nature of the college admission process that they must compete with grades, SAT scores and many other individuals to be admitted to the college of their first choice. Students have been groomed from a very young age with the question, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" that many have been focused on their life's aspirations for many years prior to stepping foot on campus. Students seem to almost grow up quicker and have many more life experiences prior to college age. They read books in high school that were once required reading for college and this puts them ahead of where previous college students were at the start of their college experience. They have the chance to go abroad on school trips and have life experiences that were once reserved for the college student. Students in the 1960's and 1970's led more sheltered lives prior to college. Theses student's life experiences with politics, taking action for a cause and new found freedoms, began when they left the confines of their homes and arrived on a college campus. Students today have much more information available to them via the internet and 24 hour cable news reports and are informed and aware of the world around them at a much younger age. The students from a generation ago had a more limited amount of exposure to the world's events. Their parents had more control over the amount of information one received from radio, television and newsprint. Good or bad the children of today are exposed to a constant amount of news from all areas of media. Today's students have already had opportunities to join and be part of many causes such as Relay for Life or MS walk and do not have to wait until they are out of the house and on a college campus before becoming part of a cause."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Last Thanksgiving - between bites of turkey - the topic transitioned to Disney. Beauty and the Beast was set to close on Broadway, and my cousin John urged the family to rush to see the show. Unmoved, my grandfather observed that Beauty and the Beast could never approach Pinocchio. My mother chimed that Cinderella would always be her favorite. My youngest cousin impetuously gushed that Cars was just about the best thing ever. His slightly older brother preferred Finding Nemo."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In late May, I sat in my last class of Paradigms and Strategies of Leadership, the first step in earning an Undergraduate Leadership Certificate at Northwestern University. My professor stood in front of the classroom seizing the opportunity to reach his final group of students before leaving the university. He chose his final words carefully. They were a reference to Mario Savio, the 21-year old Berkeley student who stood on top of a car passionately advocating free speech in 1964. He could not picture, he told our class of nearly 200 freshmen and sophomores, a Northwestern student ever feeling passionately enough about an issue to stand on top of a car and fight for it. Silence ensued as we shamefully reflected on his accusation."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"For thirteen years, I stood in line with my classmates on a conveyor belt, organized in alphabetical order, our hands by our sides, our eyes straight ahead. We wet our pants together, did our homework alone, counted to 10 together, did our homework alone, lost our teeth together, did our homework alone, played kickball together, did our homework alone, went through puberty together yet feeling alone, did our homework alone, might as well have gone to prom alone, and let's face it, by that point, we weren't doing homework at all, let alone, alone. And alone we dressed up in cap and gown, wrapping ourselves up in our achievements--ribbons, bows, and gold stars--as if we were dressing for a blizzard. Some of us looked like we were heading to the beach. Together we were stamped with society's approval, some more than others. Despite how many locker room blow jobs the class president gave or how many classes that boy who wore eyeliner skipped to care for his grandmother, we were all society's superstars that day. We were white, middle-class, and we were going to be okay."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Last April, while sifting through my college acceptances trying to make a decision, I tried to picture myself on each campus, which I imagined as vibrant places with intellectual vigor, constant conversation, and people with contagious passions. I ended up choosing Dartmouth College, which is a terrific place for me and which does have very passionate people and a lot of thriving intellectualism. I love it there. During my first spring at Dartmouth I took a course in Recent US History where the professor showed us a film entitled ""Berkeley in the Sixties,"" about the antiwar student movement. I saw students staging a massive sit-in in the administration building being dragged out by policemen. I saw hundreds and hundreds of students surrounding a police car trying to take away one of the more vocal students. These kids were all our age and were doing all of these very bold things."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The gathering of protestors at the base of Bascom Hill, the iconic center of the University of Wisconsin campus, featured a carnival atmosphere on the morning of October 18, 1967. An Uncle Sam on stilts teetered above the crowd, another activist impersonated President Johnson and the San Francisco Mime Troupe appeared in whiteface as the Guerrilla Marching Band. Activists banged tambourines while students assembled to stage an obstructive sit-in at the building where recruiters from Dow Chemical Company, the military's supplier of napalm, were conducting placement interviews, as David Maraniss described the scene in They Marched Into Sunlight. The crowd of protestors had grown to well over a thousand by noon, and around 1:30 p.m., police forced their way in to clear the building. What happened next shocked the city and eventually the nation, as the churning mass of students inside the building fell like grain under the scything of police batons. Forty-seven students w ere treated at the university medical center that day, and many more left with eyes reddened by tear gas, released for the first time ever on the campus. Madison soon became known as one of the most anti-war campuses in America, considered by some to be the Berkeley of the Midwest. Madison saw protests again at the start of the build-up to the Iraq War, but nothing that could match the Vietnam protests for violence or cultural significance. In this, the campus serves as a microcosm for the nation's universities as a whole, a barometer of activism that has fallen over time. And as the status of the American campus has descended to a tepid lull, the attention of the American public has waned. There are no more headlines about student protests. The nation no longer knows or cares what happens on these serene islands of academia, even though someday these students will be solving the problems created by a leadership that came of age in Vietnam. Former Wisconsin administrator Paul Ginsberg, who watched both the Vietnam and Iraq antiwar movements unfold, found that the Iraq protests were marked by a certain placidness that barely disturbed the quiet serenity that reigned over campus. The result was classic pothole theory, a catchphrase harkening back to the Vietnam era: Nobody goes to harangue the city council until a pothole appears on their street. In short, nobody's paying attention to college students because they're not causing any fuss."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"As a news editor of two college publications, I have become more and more aware of the apathy of the student body. Many a time, I've wondered what the point of writing college news, if no-one cares, or even reads about it. This apathy has become such an issue that some of my writers have made it the center-focus of their story. Several articles submitted for editing earlier this year have not been about the subject or event I sent my reporters to cover, but rather about how the students just simply haven't cared. This sentiment has been repeated over and over by many students at many universities, and it's true what Rick Perlstein said in his essay, 'What's the Matter With College?' - college just isn't what it used to be."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein stumbles on the crux of the matter, the culprit behind the marginalization of the college experience, but fails to pursue the point further. Perlstein notes that the distance between the campus and the market has shrunk, but the deeper truth is that the campus is for sale on the market like never before, and it is this fact that has driven the depreciation of the value of college. Today, wealth and privilege arguably play less of a role in admissions, at least at a state university like my own. Nevertheless, parents and children of every income level see themselves primarily as customers in a transaction. The Times itself noted in 1998 [1] that colleges are ""increasingly viewed as employment credentialing stations."" Perhaps I am naive to assume that it has ever been otherwise, that college was ever seen as more than a means, but at the least, it was an opinion that would have once elicited consternation instead of cheerful acceptance or weary resignation. It has been precisely what I would call the 'instrumentalization' of the college experience that has led to its devaluation."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Changes in students' attitudes and involvement in and towards college are not reflections of self-absorbed, apathetic citizens who do not value education, but rather are products of society a as a whole and the changing cost of college. Though colleges might currently not be breeding grounds for social change, they have not diminished in importance. They are places in which students can make choices which can affect them and the world around them in a plethora of ways."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"With regards to higher education, W.E.B. Dubois stated it best. ""If we make money the object of man-training we shall make money makers but not necessarily men; if we make technical skills the object of education we may posses artisans but not in nature, men. Men we shall have only as we make manhood the object of the work of schools-- intelligence, broad sympathy, knowledge of the world that was and is and of the relation of men to it--this is the curriculum of Higher Education which must underline true life."""
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"New issues appear everyday that warrant political debate, however, ""college"" as a whole has faded from the national spotlight and is only spoken of in association with negative publicity. While many politicians debate student loans, grants, and funding, the students receiving the awards and honors have faded from the picture. For a number of reasons, the step back that college students have taken in the political and cultural forefront is warranted."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"On the day when I first visited my college as an admitted student, I stood with hundreds of my future classmates as our new dean rose to make a speech. We were fresh off the assembly line of high school; we had taken our SATs and our ACTs and our advanced placement tests; we had achieved that elusive grail, admission to a hyper-competitive university. I'm sure many of us were beginning to feel supremely self-satisfied when the dean began to tell us a bit about who, as he said, our new classmates were."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"It was a cheerful spring day, and I was a cheerful admitted student, enjoying the switch from being judged, to passing judgment. Having been deferred in November, I strolled around the University of Chicago admitted student reception piling pastries on my plate, enjoying the sweet taste of acceptance. Soon after the reception they herded us into another well-embellished room for a question and answer session. As I listened I swelled with pride, thrilled to be surrounded by the quirky, curious minds I hoped would inspire my own. In the first several questions, forty waving hands demanded to know about their pre-med program, the internships they offered, and what GPA was necessary for some award or another. Amidst the furious scribbling, I detached from my long-harbored dreams and wondered what I had wished for in the first place."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"As I was finishing dinner last week, ABC's Jeopardy was playing in the background of my apartment. A few glances at the television and it became clear to me that the contestants were all bright, knowledgeable, and under thirty years old. During the interview portion of the program, it also became apparent that all three competitors had either undergraduate degrees or higher. One could argue that participation in the show is highly selective (and one would be correct), but irregardless of this fact, there were two significant conclusions to draw from this one experience. First was that a lot of Americans have college degrees these days, and second was that television programs exist from which people of any age can learn about the world, its people, and how they interact. Expanding on the latter concept, the media has extended its reach throughout the nation, into its homes, living rooms, and computers. These two conclusions will shed some light on the debate regarding the worth of college life and the degradation of the ""college experience"" in this current modern age."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"When we consider the high number of students attending university today along with the fact that the number of applicants is only projected to increase for the foreseeable future, any discussion on the relevance of universities and their students within the context of American society might well seem superfluous. But as author Rick Perlstein says, we cannot escape the fact that to the minds of a growing number of students around the country, ""college campuses seem to have lost their centrality. Why do college and college students no longer lead the culture?"" In fact as more and more students pursue a university education, the question of why they do so at all must take on a new significance for those who care about education. For as we shall see, the fact that students are becoming increasingly unhappy with their college experience suggests that the very concept of education is changing and that we are losing sight of its true value."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"It has become the only option, rather than a possible option. As a member of the emerging youth generation, there is no question as to whether or not someone will go to college, and rather, when they will go, how much it will cost and what institution they will eventually choose. Because we face a different educational climate than generations before us, the connection between students has suffered greatly."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In the United States, those with the power to make the decisions most critical to our nation have college degrees. With that said, what goes on at college has a direct impact on our nation's leaders and is therefore critical to the nation.

Perlstein is nostalgic for college as ""an alienated suburban kid's paradise""."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In the spring of my senior year in high school, to much acclaim from the 18 year old male demographic, the movie Old School was released. It depicted college as I had often seen it portrayed: a cycle of long parties and heavy hangovers which were used to recount the latest creative debauchery of last night. When I arrived at college at Fairfield University in the fall, lines from the movie echoed through every dorm on campus. Everyone's next beer was always preceeded by ""I'll do one!"" Adults who were taking classes along with undergraduates of typical college age all became known as ""Blue."" Although not many had the courage to go through with it, ""We're going streaking in the quad!"" was an ever present rallying cry."

That understanding stemmed from college culture in the late 60s and early 70s, a time of great change throughout the United States. Political and social life underwent immense transformation and part of this transformation took place on college campuses across the nation."

As I examined the various images and artifacts from the height of the counter-culture era, I noticed a familiar mentality of rebelliousness, idealism, and experimentation. At the same time, however, the fervent passion and complete abandon which this art represented seemed so remote to the sentiments of my friends and colleagues at Columbia University."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"What am I doing here? This is the question that often crosses my mind while I am sitting at my desk in reception. Everyday I see other resent college graduates walk past me. These are young men and women, all of whom have graduated from ""prestigious"" universities like Harvard or Columbia. They are all here, at firm ""X"", to become future investment bankers and operation analysts. Not me. I am temping this summer, here at firm ""X"", in hopes of earning good money, saving what I can of it, and living on a taut budget while I complete my first year of Graduate studies at NYU. I am not interested in pursuing a career in banking or politics. Both of these professions/disciplines are of interest to me, mostly because they seem to directly affect me in one way or another. I lack the technological intelligence and patience both require to maintain a successful career. The money would be great, I know, but I have a passion for something unrelated: Musical Theatre, more specifically, Musical Theatre Writing. Yes, I am the brain child of a golden bohemia, a once fading art form that is now making its come back to popular culture. To claim this passion of mine was not fostered while pursuing my undergraduate degree would be false."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"For most students at Stanford, the week before finals--Dead Week--is the most miserable week of the term. Students are faced with a daunting pile of papers to write and a week of final exams to look forward to. Even the campus newspaper, The Stanford Daily, feels the strain, publishing only a single issue on Wednesday. Every winter, the student humor magazine seizes this opportunity to publish a fake Daily on the Monday of Dead Week. The knockoff is convincing enough that it can take a few minutes of reading to pick up on the joke. However, this year many students were too outraged by the headline to read further: STANFORD DROPS TO NO. 14. Dozens of students wrote irate emails to school administrators to find out just how the school intended to fix this. Some even threatened to transfer. What ranking could prompt such a violent reaction? Not basketball. Certainly not football (the only place Stanford was ranked this year was the ESPN Bottom 10). The article reported a catastrophic ten-spot slide in the annual U.S. News & World Report rankings."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein argues in ""What's the matter with College?"" that college campuses have lost their centrality largely due to the lack of radicalism that is generated on campus compared to the vibrant, radical, take-over-the-administration-building late 1960's and early 1970's. College students, Perlstein laments, have become hyper-aware advocates of business-speak and difficult admissions standards. Colleges have lost their place as incubators of radicalism, and no longer provide a ""discrete experience"" that provided a ""radical break"" between childhood and the ""real world"". Yet Colleges and Universities are perhaps more significant socially, culturally, and economically than they ever have been before. With no raiding of campus buildings to do, how can the modern college student possibly prove his/her worth to society at large? If politicians fail to rail against the depravities of college campuses, then how can they be relevant?This past fall, nearly 18 million college students were enrolled in the 4,216 institutions of higher education that grant degrees in the United States alone, up from the 12 million 25 year ago. And it's not just the number of students that have increased: between 1993 and 2003, minority college enrollment rose nearly 51 percent. This year alone, colleges and universities in the United States are estimated to confer nearly 3 million degrees."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"College is an antique car blazing through city streets. Historic license plate tacked on, a refinished interior that makes my father's belly hum deep down in doo-wop. It has a soul, so he says. The carburetor is beautiful to him, almost sexy. But it doesn't mean that to me. I wanted one at sixteen, but now, now I know better. My generation is less and less enamored with the steely shine of these fuel hungry beasts. I've watch them age, pedaling backwards through progress. As cars puffs out greenhouse gas, their exhaust rises and I see it spelling out my name into a future hazy with smog."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"College has gone to the dogs - or, more specifically, to the drunks, the Guppies, and the 40-hour-a-week stiffs. Through parental pressure and a desperate need to keep up with the rest of the material-driven world, students today place a much stronger emphasis on what they can gain from college, rather than what they can learn from their time at school. A college degree has always held a significant amount of weight in the job market, but in more recent years it has been seen as more of a requirement for those seeking employment in the professional workforce. In response, colleges have had to cater to a much larger and more diverse population of students, many of whom see college only as the next step to a career. The responsibility for the change in the institution of secondary education does not rest on the shoulders of the colleges themselves; like any other successful business, they are simply reacting to the wants of their consumers - who demand success, wealth, and power at a higher rate than ever before."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"College was once a truly unique institution, set-apart, more or less, from the conventions of society. It was freedom institutionalized (ironically enough). Free for the first time in their lives, kids learned quickly that there is more to this world than what mom and dad showed 'em. There were boobs, there were drugs, there was life. Oh and wait, politicians aren't always truthful, either! Really? Yes, man. And answers aren't always obvious. Really? Yes."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Education, including college, matters. Whether it does or not is indisputable. In his essay ""What's The Matter With College?"" Rick Perlstein does not deny that fact. However, what he does say is that the way in which college has mattered has changed drastically since the days of the '60s and '70s, along with our culture in general. Part of the problem he identifies is that college now matters more than it ever has, but for much different reasons."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"For dedicated parents living in America, there is no goal they truly want more for their children then for them to have a lifetime of success and to be happy. Most children have to grow up constantly listening to their parent(s) lecture about maintaining good grades and going to college. To children, this was just their parent's harassing them. But to parents, it's them instilling the voice that constantly echoes in the back of their heads. For the most part, children plan to go to college right after high school. Some vow to become doctors. Others may decide that teaching will be their passion. Their ambitions are endless. But somewhere between puberty and college, their minds change. With the influences among our children and with the growing population of technical schools, children veer off the road to college. Unfortunately, because of this decision, not only is the future of our lawyers, doctors, teachers, and a plentiful amount of other careers in danger, the road to a one tracked mind world has already been set to be paved."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"When my mother and grandmother came to visit me at UC Santa Cruz this spring, I expected them to feel as any parent and grandparent should on a college campus: out of place, uncomfortable, quaintly bewildered. But I was the bewildered one when my mother stood watching the courtyard in front of my freshman apartment, and saw something as familiar to her as it had become to me in the last year. Three nineteen year old males, with long limp hair and slouching lean bodies to match, were tossing a Frisbee in lazy arcs. Two were shirtless; the third wore a tie-dyed Grateful Dead t-shirt. Three generations of women stood to the side, observing. Before I got too embarrassed and herded my ancestors away, my mother turned to hers and asked, ""Mom, doesn't this remind you of the seventies?"" She nodded emphatically, adding ""Mhhmm. You're right."""
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"After high school was over, I was tired. I felt like I had spent four years (and possibly even more) in a haze of SAT prep, extra-curricular activities, and social engagements. I was excited for college, but at the same time, exhausted."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,It is not a matter of the college experience being less critical to the nation than it was a generation ago it is just a different experience altogether.
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The percentage of high school seniors who attend college has been increasing rapidly over the past couple decades, which raises the question ""what compelled those students to continue their education?"" Many students these days feel that they must attend college if they expect to secure a good job, and in many cases the parents are willing to pay for the college education of their children who then are expected do well in college, but also to stick with it no matter what. This causes a very high pressure atmosphere of college which can be very destructive, but it is not felt equally by all students, and as such cannot be the sole means of grading the health of college life today."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In his essay ""What's the Matter With College?"" author and historian Rick Perlstein confronts the issue of why today's universities are no longer the progressive institutions and cultural leaders they were during the 1960s and 1970s. He asks, ""Why do college and college students no longer lead the culture? Why does student life no longer seem all that important?"" as it did when the anti-war protests at universities like Berkeley and Kent State made headlines and weighed on the collective conscious of Americans."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"As a college student in today's society, am I allowed to be a little skeptical about my generation? Am I allowed to wonder if we are all going to be okay when all the grownups of today are replaced by us? I have to wonder, will we finally be forced to be responsible and act like we care about what is going on around the world and in this country?"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Looking back on my four years at UC Berkeley, I wonder if it is the same university it was forty years ago. Certainly the protests are smaller, more sparsely attended, and the speakers less fiery. Buildings are not occupied, and though you can still find a copy of The Socialist Worker without much effort, not many students are moved to read it. The presence of industry is everywhere apparent, not just in corporate sponsorships, but in cooperative research and development of technology. Mr. Perlstein is certainly right that market thinking has scaled the walls that once guarded the ivory tower. In this sense, the dividing line between the ideals of the university and the cold calculations of business has certainly been crossed enough times to make it seem a relic of another era."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In the spring of 1968, the halls of Columbia University witnessed a defining moment of the decade as students occupied the campus in protest of the university's perceived involvement with the Vietnam War and a controversial building program. That was almost forty years ago--forty years of collegiate peace that have made such an uprising almost unthinkable now. Why is this so? Why are today's campuses such docile places? Rick Perlstein's article ""What's the Matter with College?"" attempts to answer that question by painting a vaguely disturbing portrait of the typical undergrad as a cog content to run smoothly in the commercialist juggernaut of the American university."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In the past year I realized that my greatest sorrow will be to have lived in a time saturated in such apathy that even the small minority which has created all of the change in human history can not be churned up out of the depths of market culture. Economic competition, not intellectual freedom, has a hold on educational communities and it is not letting go."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"We college students may no longer be staging mass protests or flirting with radical ideologies like our parents did, but it is not because college is no longer important. It is because of the hyper-credentialism of contemporary American society, which has partially sterilized our ability to maximize college's potential."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I never doubted that attending college is essential to a life well lived. Young, I envisioned myself at college, surrounded by intellect, absorbing vibrant conversations about philosophy and current events, walking under autumnal trees shedding richly colored leaves, as I struggled to carry a stack of classic novels with which I was charged with wrestling. I replayed this fantasy throughout high school, the way a desert trekker conjures an oasis."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"My Dad, a Brooklyn Dodgers fan from the start used to attend games in regularity with his Norwegian neighborhood friends, way in the back, high up in the stands, popping peanuts into mouths that were busy shouting at the umpires and error happy ball players. Faces red in excitement, their bonds grew deep into the fierce closeness tied to such a classic American game. It took a scorching summer evening at a Philadelphia Phillies game for me to finally understand my father and his love for baseball. Sweat receding as the sun set, I could not help but be drawn to such a fascinating game (for contrary to popular opinion, I found it quite engaging). However, the joy and progression of the baseball game was soon overshadowed by the suffocating commercialism and false countenance that filled the stadium. Glancing around I noticed the American stereotype in all it's glory: Chase Utley jerseys so snug around big bellies, empty cups of steak flavored slushies strewn about, and somehow an overabundance of cell phone users discussing important business in the middle of the fourth inning. Dolefully, I was overwhelmed by such an oblivion to the beautifully graceful sport that was being played there in the lights. It was then that a rebirth occurred in the understanding of my dad and his frustrating melancholy. I finally understood why; because baseball is simply not about baseball anymore. In fact, my father and I are not so far apart in our frustrations with the world for when people ask me, ""why are you not return to school in the fall?"" I explain, how college is not about knowledge anymore."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I used to want to lead a life that would live outside the ""normal"" aspects that society wanted for me--this was before I even thought about what it meant to be a part of college. College meant getting away from all that I had managed to avoid during high school, it meant getting out of the world where me being antisocial was the only thing that would inspire me to write some decent lines upon processed bark. College was freedom, freedom from constraints: freedom to read and discuss Nietzsche with other intellects, freedom to live a life lacking any ""adult"" responsibilities, freedom to branch out and meet people I actually wanted to meet and be friends with. That was the definition of college I believed in, until it was time to decide where I wanted to go. As I read more about college life, and as I discussed the reasons as to why even bother spending such a long time in an institution, I realized that college was the path that led to living the life of a ""normal"" person who contributes money and time to society and who believes in the altruistic, humanistic approach to life."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I spent my senior year at Denison University working on an almost two-hundred page non-fiction project about my fellow classmates. The slogan Denison University plastered on all of the tee-shirts they handed out during my freshman year orientation read: ""It's not the destination. It's the journey."" And so I felt it was appropriate for my senior year writing project, that I should fill my pages with stories of my journey from freshman to senior year at Denison. I wrote about the roommates I had, the friendships that unraveled, the classes I'd taken, and whether or not I really had traveled all that far in the end. But mostly I wrote about television, Facebook, AIM, and MySpace: the pillars of my undergraduate education. I started the project by explaining to my writing advisor, Holly, a teacher only about five years my senior and fresh out of grad school--that the difference between Denison University and the rest of the colleges and universities in the country was that we at Denison lived in a bubble. Greek life was the end-all-be-all to my classmates and who was dating who mattered much more to most of the kids on campus than what was happening in Iraq, Darfur, the White House, or even the rural Ohio communities surrounding campus. I told her that because our campus was so small and sheltered, it was hard for kids to relate to the problems of the outside world."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Ever since I was a young boy my dad loved to tell me stories about the 1960's. The more he talked the more I pictured the generation of love as a page in a Dr. Seuss book. He would try his best to explain that people were different then. They were ""resonating"" as he would put it, or like philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson said much earlier, every heart vibrates to one iron string."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"If the collegiate world were a cafeteria, its smattering of outlets for student expression would be like my dining hall's smorgasbord of breakfast cereals. While most students are quite content to eat the same cereal every day (I adhere to a strict diet of Cinnamon Toast Crunch), there certainly is an excess of options. So, too, do today's students have the opportunity in their college careers to experiment in hundreds of activities in order to define their interests. Yet, as Rick Perlstein, David Brooks, and others have pointed out, something sets our generation apart from the turbulent college campuses of the 1960s. Perlstein asks, ""What's the matter with college?"" While I can not hope to accurately compare the college atmospheres of today and the 1960s, I can definitely give some insight into our current situation."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The most important class I took in college was a writing seminar titled ""Power and Politics: Theories of Hegemony"". I did not actually choose the course. Students were required to list their top five choices for writing seminars and were placed through a lottery-type process. I listed this course as my last choice, but through fortuitous fate, I found myself in a room with Marxists, socialists, neo-conservatives, and a communist teacher who repudiated attempts to elicit her position on controversial topics. Officially, she kept her political views a secret in order to prevent students from ""sucking up"" in their essays--the most natural course for first-year students."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"My mother was a teenager in the 1960's, and in her twenties duringthe turbulent 1970's. Whenever I think of the classic collegeexperience, I think of her, and what she says was her primaryfocus: the Beatles. Yes, those moptops; not the war in Vietnam, notthe Civil Rights movement; neither the Equal Rights Amendment northe hopeful elections of the late 1960's piqued her interests, buta popular band garnered her support. For years I have tried to cometo an explanation for this phenomenon. In the wake of a thoroughreading of Rick Perlstein's article 'What is Wrong with College?',detailing all that is lacking in the present college experience,while in stark contrast with his glorified account of the activismof undergraduates of lore, I think I may have found it. My answeras to why? She didn't go to college."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Perhaps the biggest complaint heard on today's college campuses is being voiced by both exasperated parents and overwhelmed students: the increasing cost of a seemingly infinitely expensive tuition. This involuntary focus on the monetary reality of today's students reflects a broader shift which has brought economic mindsets, in various forms, to the forefront of the college experience. Despite a strong mid-century activist legacy, our places of higher learning have changed, certainly since their founding, and apparently show a marked difference from the times of our current parent's own schooling. But what has changed? Large institutions are notoriously impervious to transformations, and a closer examination shows that much of American college has actually remained static; what has changed is its place in an increasingly decentralized, interconnected, and fast-moving world."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"A tangible sense of purpose hung in the room as the entire newspaper staff stood watching last November's election on a small TV in our office. We'd been covering the election season for months, and we all knew the issues that hung in the balance. The future of our country on a range of topics -- from the war in Iraq to global climate change to health care -- was at stake."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Why College Matters. Well, It is not very hard to explain why college matters. The trouble is trying to get people to understand why it doesn't matter as much as nostalgic corn-balls from back in the day would claim. In the article offered for comment the author draws most of the right conclusions in the end. However he fails to realise that even though he may be right(which he actually is, by the way) that does not necessarily diminish the important role of the college experience."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Four decades ago, during the period that Rick Perlstein longs to relive in his essay, ""What's the Matter with College?"" a generation made a stark departure from everything they knew. The Baby Boomer generation, amid their Woodstock hippie days and their flag-burning riotous nights, made radical changes to American society. They challenged the way America thought, acted, and functioned in the rest of the world."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In a speech to a group of college students two years ago, Steve Jobs, Apple Corporation's current chief executive, remarked that it wasn't necessarily the core, primary disciplines of college that taught him the importance of imagination. To the casual observer, it might have seemed obvious that Mr. Jobs was describing an example where creativity trumped formal schooling. The only problem was that it wasn't: Mr. Jobs said that he designed Apple's interface, and other creative endeavors, after having been inspired by a college calligraphy class."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I have lately been considering a decision that would be a betrayal to my station, my family's expectations, and the conventional wisdom that is based on income data. It is surprising enough to find myself in doubt of one of the totems of the middle class, the up-and-coming--my generation's inheritance from the Baby Boomers--yet more surprising because I began at The University of Georgia three years ago with promise and ambition and lists of goals to prove it. Three years out I've become used to giving family friends the sunny responses they want to hear to questions like ""Is college everything you hoped it would be?"" and ""Oh, I bet you're making all A's."" The truth is that today's college experience is in some ways the deformed descendant of the college experience that indelibly animated the 1960s."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"We are moving toward an educational system where performance is measured quantitatively more and more. In this world of SATs, funding systems based on test scores, and increasingly competitive college entrance requirements, students must think of themselves in how they literally measure up on paper. This creates a mentality where working for a grade, a test score, and ultimately a high salary are what students use to judge their own value. A bachelor's degree does not hold the prestige it did a generation ago. It is merely a bench mark to even be considered for the majority of jobs in today's globalizing economy."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"College is, as it always has been, an institution based on the free flow of ideas. It is a period of prolonged childhood when the definition of who we are is shaped and molded before becoming tattooed onto ourselves. Amidst the football tailgates and all-nighters spent cramming for exams, college remains an opportunity to immerse ourselves in the unfamiliar and presents us with the chance to let these new experiences shape who we will be when we enter the ""real world."""
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Since the close of the spring term, I have been living in Rosario, Argentina as a visiting researcher in the lab of Javier Palatnik, a molecular biologist whose discovery of how microRNA controls plant development appeared on the cover of Nature in late 2003. After three months of work, I can say with confidence that I don't expect to become a plant biologist. Experiments take weeks to set up. Half the time the plants don't grow. And when I'm standing in the lab's cramped growth chamber staring at row after row of plastic cups filled with Arabidopsis thalina (a Weed-Be-Gone dream kill), I never do get that curing cancer feeling. Sometimes the frustration gets to me and I wonder if becoming a scientist, with all its intellectual and cultural cachet, is little more than accepting repeated and lifelong failure. But regardless of my future plans, I've certainly learned scores about both the practice of modern science and the process of contemporary science education around the world. In terms of my own education, I've learned I have ample time to make a choice."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I am on the cusp of my senior year of college, and the end - looming nearer and nearer with alarming alacrity - has brought me to a kind of stasis, one that avoids fall semester course registration and post-college planning. I should be thinking about careers or graduate school applications and their requisite exams; in fact if my go-getter friends are any measure, I should be doing all of the above while struggling, neck-deep, in a summer internship. Instead I am sleeping at four, waking at noon, and staggering, still drunk with sleep, the three blocks that stand between my apartment and my part-time job at the University of Pennsylvania. Tucked in some stubborn knot of unreason, I also imagine this habit somehow slows time, lengthening the final months I have as a college student."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Is it safe to say that making the Dean's or President's list or simply making the grade; is what the college experience is all about? Are we - ""the modern student"" - ashamed to be as active as our predecessors were, unwilling to take a stand for substantial issues not specifically the ones that affect us personally, but issues that indirectly concern us locally and globally? Can we replace the current egotistical behavior of students with a more altruistic form of humanity?"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Traditionalists today consider college a vestigial conduit to students' ultimate ambitions in the ""real world.""

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The question should not be why does college matter? It matters for so many reasons: it ensures students a descent livelihood, it equips students to become a responsible adult and above all it is one of the few options that guide students to a higher quality of life. Actually, the most appropriate question to pose is ""what is the matter that college does not matter anymore?"""

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The official rules of this essay contest asked me to explain ""why college matters,"" as if to suggest that I refute Mr. Perlstein's viewpoint. Unfortunately, I don't believe that I can, in good conscience, present a cogent argument for why and how he's wrong. As much as it pains me to say so, a man who's pushing forty has my generation's college experience completely pegged. So as much as I'd like to tell you why college matters, I'm not entirely sure that it does anymore."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"A friend recently told me that, as a child, she dreamed of a city with no parents, where no one was told what to do. It never occurred to her that this fantasy metropolis was, in essence, college. Growing up in the quintessential university town of Madison, Wisconsin, and reared by the generation that created the college image we now know, I have heard countless stories about the ""best four years of one's life."" A wild John Belushi embodied the college experience in 1978's Animal House, reinforcing the enduring collegiate image of chaotic freedom. Touted as the beginning of your life, it is the place to find out who you really are. However, college has changed over time. As I approached this milestone in my own life, I began to wonder what these years would be like for me. Would the description painted by a group of baby boomers that went to college in its ""glory days"" prove true today?"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In 1974, President Richard Nixon refused to surrender tapes and documents subpoenaed by the Senate Watergate Committee, the American economy was enduring a persistent oil crisis, and my mother turned seventeen. As an early high school graduate, she left Queens, NY for the first time in her life, and began her journey toward a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. The use of the word ""journey"" is fundamental in this context because one of the most inspirational stories she has to her name is what my mother fondly recalls as her ""circuitous path to self-discovery."" This winding route took her to and from various schools across the globe, culminating with an eventual Bachelor of Fine Arts from Minneapolis School of Art and Design and, many years later, a medical degree from Cornell University Medical School. Today it is 2007, and while there is another oil crisis devastating the economies of many American communities, and high ranking officials continue to disregard subpoenas, the college experience has certainly diverged from what it once was. We have come from a generation whose youth believed that the answers to life's most significant questions were ""blowing in the wind,""--to become a new generation of students who want those same answers, right here, right now. Preferably collated. My mother's college experience, while unique, was not unheard of in the 1960's and 70's. Those decades brought about an incredible generation of American adolescents who set out to change the world, one campus at a time; my mother was no exception to this trend. These days, my parents both happily recount experiences of peaceful yet poignant dissidence--my father even has a trove of brightly colored (yet, seldom tie-dyed) pins and badges documenting his participation. To be sure, they were fortunate to grow up in a time where this youthful dissent, while discouraged and opposed, was never effectively quelled. Students felt that their opinions warranted change and consequently, united in their beliefs to create a revolution. Through these demonstrative efforts, they fought for myriad causes of paramount importance: civil rights, humanitarian goals, and of course, peace. In turn, college became a critical time in which students learned from the experience of others and put a unified, tangible strain on conservative minds to consider a more progressive way of life. In March of 1970, for example, there was a protest on the steps of Colby College's Lorimer Chapel. The protestors quietly assembled for a full week to draw attention to college policies they found were unfair toward minority and underprivileged students. I attend Colby, a private liberal arts college in New England, and I feel extremely proud to be a student at an institution with such a rich history of protest. Yet I admit with resignation, that my college no longer embodies the same activist spirit it once did. Although students sometimes have concerns similar to the Lorimer protestors, nothing remotely comparable to the sit-in would ever occur there today. Indeed, to the dismay of unconventional thinkers everywhere, many of them our own parents, students of my generation are more likely to step either in line or in 'the box' then sit down firmly and block the queue."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,One of the striking features of the American education system is its commitment to a liberal education. We have both large breadth requirements and opportunities to take electives in high school and college. In many other countries students must specialize in their academic pursuits very early. By the time a European student is the age of an American high school sophomore he or she is already deciding which highly-specialized college to enter.
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"At the heart of Rick Perlstein's essay, ""What's the Matter with College?"" seems to be the observation that college students no longer see themselves in a world apart from the rest of America, that they don't spend these four years in a whirl of jazz, beat poetry and political activism that the masses cannot initiate but can only react to. As a senior at a large research university I can say that my experience affirms Mr. Perlstein's suspicion. But I cannot say that this change has been a loss to the nation."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Apparently we're in a crisis when it comes to higher education. Nobody's paying attention to college! We're not driving the culture! Politicians aren't crusading against our vile orgies! Gee whiz, I wish I'd gone to college back in the good old days when college was college."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"If we were to examine the mechanisms of college today, we would find the framework of these institutions to be startlingly similar to those of a factory. I recently received my undergraduate degree from Eugene Lang, the undergraduate Liberal Arts division of New School University. The New School University is an appropriate place to examine the streamlining of the ""college experience"". My mother's college experience took place during the golden age of campus activism, the 1960's. Regardless, she finished her undergraduate degree in less than three years, for she did not have the time or financial opportunities to enjoy the frontier of American lifestyles as reminisced in Rick Perlstein's essay. Her only ""radical"" act was wearing jeans to school.. Yet, when it came time for her son to start applying to college, she was awash in nostalgia. For my mother, who didn't have the privilege to live on a college campus or take part in any extra-curricular activities, a reminder of these years still exuded a sense of nervous excitement. Herein lies the defining characteristic of my generation: there is no more excitement, because there is no more danger in the college experience; no more lust for danger. By ""danger"", I do not infer acts of violence. By danger, I mean the uncertainty entangled with the new- the mystery in experiencing the never before. The contemporary college experience is becoming similar to life in a cubicle with one's computer as their sole connection to the social sphere."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"After only one semester at Washington University, it seems to me that most college students--most of my peers--are much more apathetic than I had always imagined they would be. I grew up hearing that ""children are the future,"" and it made sense to me that the four years of college were when the children created and became the future. While this may have been true in another generation, it certainly doesn't seem to be the case now."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein's article ""What's the Matter With College?"" reminds me of an earlier NY Times essay entitled ""Diversity's False Solace"" by Walter Benn Michaels. In his essay, Michaels' main thesis is that the issue of race is a distraction from the much larger issue of economic inequality. My main thesis is that the issue of ""what's the matter with college"" is a distraction from the much larger issue of ""what's the matter with America?"""
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"My mother says that Brown University, where I am a senior, is a four-year summer camp, a haven for overgrown babies. After all, we have a teddy bear for a mascot, attend officially sponsored ice cream parties and follow as few academic rules as possible. Meanwhile, we are unconcerned with burning our bras, protesting for peace or ""sticking it to the man."" If my parents are right, the observation says more about the times we live in than the peculiarities of Brown."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I've known many people that attended college back when it was college. In fact, during their enrollment, they witnessed the most life changing events at the turn of the century. The difference between college students back in the 60's and college students living during the 20th century is that we are not as active as we need to be in this generation. As I brainstormed for directions to take this essay, my mind stumbled across the importance of the Civil Right's Movement to our nations' society. If America was a cotton field, college students during the 60's were its seeds implanted in the soil. What I've learned from the veterans of the Civil Right's Movement is that college facilities along with churches were central locations used for organizing and gaining empowerment to protest against the inequalities of the social justice systems."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In his fantasy of the 1960s, Mr. Perlstein longs for the good old days of college: a hippie-radical-beatnik's paradise, free of social conventions and responsibility. He feels that his nostalgic vision has been replaced by a hyper-organized, capitalist, and infantilizing system where only ""organization"" drones thrive. In fact, college has not really changed since the sixties, even less so than when he went to school, and it really is not as bad as he suggests. I know only one of my contemporaries who is dissatisfied with college, and that is because his school is 85% male. Overwhelmingly, my generation is having a great time at college, experiencing independence, responsibility, social awareness, and activism like never before in our lives. Mr. Perlstein overlooks that the sixties' values he misses are still part of the college experience, but these values are expressed differently by a new generation. We're not inferior, just unique."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Sitting in my apartment for hours amid common undergraduate items like scattered socks, old textbooks, an unhung clock and an overdue change-of-address form, frequently googling, facebooking, myspace'ing, and wikipedia'ing, I wonder how anyone can pose the question ""Is the college experience less critical to the nation than it was a generation ago?"" without its comprehensibility sucking the conviction right out of the question. The advent of technology and the exponential increase in ideological marketing dilute the originality and space for critical thought that is the essence of college life. Politicians and special interests make issues that are just as tumultuous today as they were thirty years ago, seem as distant from college life as college life is from the real world."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In his dismayed, flimsily-argued essay on the state of the American undergraduate experience, Rick Perlstein asks whether college remains ""interesting enough to become a topic of national obsession."" He quickly concludes that it is not."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Half. That is how many graduating high school seniors will enroll in college. Today, more than ever, high school students and adults alike are pursuing higher education. But still less than a third of the adult population holds at least a bachelors degree. In his article, ""What's the Matter With College,"" Rick Perlstein critiques America's higher education system, saying that college has lost its centrality both on campuses and in society. He is accurate in saying college campuses are not playing the same role they did a generation ago, but, in response to Mr. Perlstein, this role-change is not necessarily for the worse. What's wrong with college? Not the institution or its place in society, but the upsetting, yet shrinking, mindset that college is only for those who can get there on their own."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Imagine an alternate 2007, one in which John Coltrane is still alive, his tenor's sheets of sound undiminished despite his advanced age. Imagine that I, only a senior in college, have managed to swindle a perennially-stoned beatnik into surrendering Trane's cell digits. (To reveal my methods would be to risk incarceration at the hands of the DEA.) And then imagine that I've had every student in my dormitory send him a text message simultaneously, begging him to give us an impromptu recital and to bring McCoy Tyner along, too."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"If it is true, as Balzac once observed, that behind every great fortune lies a great crime, then one need look no further than Yale University's twenty-two billion dollar endowment to explain the school's decay. I hope I do not sound too much like the jaded radicals with whom my father fell in when he abandoned his mother to her suburban Long Island house and his father to his job as a cutter in a garment factory. I hope I do not sound like those chain smoking, bitter Marxists, I say, because those types are very out of favor in today's university. Instead you have leftists who have chosen their politics the way you or I might pick out an ice cream sundae at one of those obliging ice cream parlors where they will mix together whatever you like. Start with a base of third wave feminism; balance the acidity with the smooth flavor of some French post-structuralism: and just sprinkle the whole thing with the guilt complex that follows the upper-middle class around like a bitter aftertaste. Of course, the whole thing is going to cost you."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"A few weeks ago I walked into a Shenzhen classroom for my first day of teaching the SAT to Chinese high school students. Their intensity, discipline, and drive were no surprise, but I was taken aback by their professed goals and aspirations. Almost unanimously, they hoped to study economics or business and to work in finance. Being from Harvard, this was nothing I hadn't encountered on a daily basis, but when I asked what motivated their interest I was surprised by the response. Very candidly (and with a face that screamed, ""are you an idiot?"") one girl offered her succinct reply--""the money."""
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Every time I come home from college for vacation my father asks me the same question, if there is any significant anti-war movement on campus, and every time is mystified by my negative response. I can understand his confusion. He started college in 1968, campaigned for McCarthy and was still considered conservative for not repudiating capitalism altogether. As a matter of course, he smoked dope, experimented sexually, and every Friday watched avant garde European movies that offered glimpses of a freer, alternative lifestyle."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein expresses in ""What's the Matter with College?"" that college as it once was faces extinction. In many ways Perlstein is right: college is actually no longer what it once was, the number of schools has increased, the amounts of students attending has increased, drop outs have increased, and tuition has increased. Colleges may be changing all over the country in countless ways, but the reason college matters remains unchanged. The underlying reason for college's existence is to help the individual to become who he or she wants to be, even though schools may not always appear to enable students to reach their dreams. Today, college appears like a party with 20,000 kids all alike, or it appears as a chance to meet a mate, or it appears like a place to go for four years and get piece of paper somehow making you more employable. But it is far more than what it appears to be today as Perlstein has overlooked. Regardless of the face college takes today, the basis for college has never changed from the day it appeared here in America. College matters because it provides an opportunity unequal to any other in that it provides an abundance of resources and culture assisting people in becoming what they want to be."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In February 2005, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that a college education nearly doubles the average income. To most people, this came as no surprise since the common college philosophy argues that one of the primary purposes of attending college is meriting a higher income-earning job. Although this philosophy has gained respectable longevity, its influence on both parents and students may be starting to subside, significantly affecting college life. Two colleges of interest, Harvard College and the University of California: San Diego, share vastly similar average graduate starting salaries--approximately $51,000 annually--yet the number of college applicants to available spots at UCSD is only 2 to 1, which is dwarfed in comparison to Harvard's colossal 11 to 1 ratio. Furthermore, the tuition at UCSD is nearly half that of Harvard, indicating that higher education has evidently developed some significant non-economic incentives over the years."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"As a 2007 graduate from Skidmore College, I was intrigued to read Rick Perlstein's article ""What's the Matter with College"", since I too have recently been surveying my college career, although not from so great a distance. Last weekend, for the first time since graduating in May, I returned to Saratoga Springs, the town that had been my home for the past four years. Upon arrival, I was caught up in a barrage of greetings from friends who had a whole summer's worth of activities and romances on which to fill me in. Tessa showed me the film shorts she had been working on as part of a summer film class. My former housemate, Ryan, walked me through their rented summer house, pointing out his latest textile endeavors and giving me the highs and lows of his graphic design internship. One friend rushed over to the house, still grungy and sweaty from an early morning job tracking common yellowthroats for a Skidmore ornithology professor. I only got a brief hello from two friends clomping out the door in muddy hiking boots, headed for Lake George. I met Cora, a fellow social work major, for lunch and heard her intense stories from working at a camp for children with terminal illnesses. After a long night of drinking and silliness with these friends, I stumbled to bed in the dark and smiled when I woke up to a room entirely plastered with ""Endless/End THIS War"" posters."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"It's 1964 and you run to your dorm window to see hundreds of your colleagues parading the campus with signs and chanting ""Hell no we won't go"" and ""Make love not war"". Now it's 2006 and you go outside your dorm room only to see keg stands in the common room and the students yelling ""chug""."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"As a rising senior, I cannot say that I have spent the last three years rallying against the genocide in Darfur or lobbying for higher wages for university employees. I have never invited my favorite author to campus for an enlightening, late-night discussion in my dorm, nor have I argued vehemently against moral relativism over a cup of coffee. Instead, I spend hours in the library with my laptop and textbooks writing papers and studying for exams. When I graduate as a molecular biology major, I will have performed original research in the lab and memorized thousands of facts about viruses and cell structure. Additionally, I serve on the organizational board of our volunteer council, a position that has allowed me to develop and practice leadership skills. One of my main concerns as I begin my senior year is how I will spend my first few years following graduation, and although my college years were not particularly exciting or newsworthy, they have prepared me well for almost any career I choose."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"It may be easy for the older generations to increasingly dismiss the value of our nations institutions as time moves on. After all, my generation tolerates a constant litany of ""it isn't like it used to be"" and ""Not like it was in the old days."" My parent's world of trudging 10 miles uphill through snow, rain and a costly, idiotic war is long gone. Well, not the war, but that's another issue all together. As a student at Bennington College in Vermont, I attend what is perhaps the ""Jericho"" of the wild and free style of education so lovingly referenced by Mr. Perlstein in his essay. The independent spirit, the student body so ready to challenge authority are all there but the basic rewards and labors of going to college have changed so quietly and subtlety that we are left unprepared by our idyllic notions of the Alma Mater. ""College as America used to understand it is coming to an end,"" Mr. Perlstein states in his article ""What's the Matter With College?"" To which I would answer; well, of course it is, honestly what did you expect? The question that should be asked is not why the bucolic image of collegiate life is disappearing but rather what has changed about the world as we know it and what can the college experience still offer to us students. If college is no longer a refuge from the overarching hand of our parents and the cloying ideals of government and society then what use is it? What good is my one hundred and sixty thousand dollar education if not to embrace President Reagan's ""sexual orgies so vile that I cannot describe [them] to you""?"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein is correct in asserting that the college experience of students today is different from that of students a generation ago. College itself is not viewed in the same way, nor is it valued the same. I would not argue that it is valued any less than it has been in past times, but that it simply has been given a different place in our society. It is still a very important aspect of transitioning from childhood to adulthood, but its effects are less apparent."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"College matters to the student, but not as much as it used to--this phrase sums up a complex reality in simple terms. Let's all look at the picture here (not just glance, but really look at it). Young adults in general don't read, are addicted to mass media, and are lazy. This new generation, which I shall call Generation Z (after what they catch), is an easy target for the reason why colleges aren't the same as they used to be. I can imagine it now: an aged hippie or, better (worse?) yet, a beatnik, reminiscing about the good old days, when ""we had the motivation to change the world, by dinghy!"", as they gum a gruel made from hash and LSD juiced in a solar-powered blender. It's a sad day when such things happen. Yet, it is happening. Yes, it is true that some young adults are unmotivated, and, yes, it is easy to blame them for the college experience atrophying."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Nothing, I don't think. The only thing wrong is how his article feels, irritatingly, like it's trying to cheapen my college experience, a college experience that will cost upwards of $160,000. The other thing that's wrong is that I only have an hour and twenty minutes to complete this essay (no worries, I made an outline)."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Not too long ago, Rick Perlstein assures us, universities in this country had a certain cultural and political cachet. In California, the public university system was at the heart of the 1966 governor's race. The campuses had a ""centrality."" They were a ""national obsession."" Today's kids, he somberly informs us, barely match up. We are alternatively too enmeshed in the market or too infantilized. We have been measured and we have come up lacking. I have only one response: Have you really looked at us?"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"As baby boomers settle into middle-age, many watch their children enter what they sentimentalize as the best years of their life: their college years. With memories of picket signs and protests, many recall their outrageous behavior during that idealistic time. In 1776, Thomas Jefferson sat down with a pen in his hand, and almost exactly just short of two centuries later America again saw unrelenting idealism: the college student of the 1960's and 70's."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"""The earthy scent of Oberlin's dining cooperatives differs from the sanitized odor of our institutional cafeterias in a way that epitomizes the appeal of these dining options to very different segments of the school's population. The all-you-can eat offerings, insensate to concepts of scarcity or seasonality, that grace Stevenson Dining Hall's daily menu are an affront to the radical tradition of food made from wholesome ingredients by cooperative labor. I suspect that an incoming freshman's choice to eat at a campus dining hall rather than a co-op would offend the sentiments of devoted co-opers for the same reasons that today's discretely liberal, market-oriented college students trouble Mr. Perlstein."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I grew up without fear. Like most of my generation I skipped through school, mildly aware of wars raging halfway around the world, doted on by my baby boomer parents. In place of true fear, I wallowed in a constant state of self-important anxiety. Was I smart enough? Would I succeed in life? Would I live up to everyone's expectations?"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein introduces his essay What's the matter with college? with an anecdote from the 1966 California gubernatorial race between Governor Pat Brown and Ronald Reagan. Governor Brown recognized public higher education as a means for anyone desiring a better life through the better opportunities available to those with a college degree, and campaigned on his success in building a comprehensive state university system. Ronald Reagan, however, preached a return to the days of raccoon coats and silver flasks with few campuses, closed to all but the privileged white males."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"If this overused and cliche statement were more relevant or appropriate to the topic at hand, Bob Dylan would stop selling ladies undergarments and students would protest the Iraq War on the lawn of the Whitehouse. Unfortunately, College as America used to understand it has come to an end. Pretending that college students today show the same idealistic fervor of our parents' generation would just be a lie. Even at a campus set in the heart of Greenwich Village, the birthplace of le tout New York boheme, there is a stark difference between college life then and now. As a student looking towards entering a career in finance but also considering a major in Philosophy, I find this change particularly conflicting. I am not lamenting for the woes of political apathy or nihilism in my generation, I am saying that college, as America used to understand it, can still make a comeback."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"My university's most recent unspoken motto; ""access to excellence"", has morphed radically from what it must have meant during Rick Perlstein's college era. Access, something that used to be seen as an opportunity for those who deserved it, has morphed into an opportunity for any who reach for it, fund it, or debt themselves into it. Excellence, something once interpreted as the expectation of a graduate not only articulate and well rounded, but also a competent and ethical, has become defined as prepared professionals ignorant of how to move beyond textbook knowledge. This has led to the growth of my university- Temple, an institution geared towards the blue collared population of America, but it also represents a change in the mindset of the American public. Suddenly the American public wants everyone to be the 'best' and the 'brightest' while ignoring that both of those adjectives address a minority, and cannot encompass a nation that is comparing its own population to itself."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I promised my roommates that I would get this all down one day. I promised them I would finally tell the world: I cry in bathrooms. We all cried in bathrooms. Like lost puppies in a colossal sea of college-level sameness, we locked ourselves in quasi-private bathroom stalls and cried. There were the ones in Doe, (there were always staff coming in and out, fist-shake!) and the one in Gianinni Hall where I splotchily ran into an economic advisor to the World Bank. Or how about the International and Area Studies building, a bathroom that looked more like a shabby country-club locker room, with the faux hospitality of scented hand lotion and tampax. All of these and more, and I got to know pretty seriously what if feels like to be a disillusioned college student."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I was born in a country where college does not exist. There is no period of separation from home and intense interaction with peers, no encouraged period of individual growth, both intellectual and emotional. Instead, immediately after high school, Russian teens choose their professions and attend graduate or technical school. Most assume adult responsibilities like marriage and family early in life, at least earlier than comparable young adults in the United States. This happens not only because of economics or similar causes, but also because of a social belief system very different from that of the United States, one in which college -- both as a reflection of and an influence on society - is nonexistent. America is nearly unique it its dedication of this time of personal growth in the life of a young adult, and the role college plays in our society - even as different generations pass through it -- cannot be underestimated. I therefore have to disagree with Mr. Perlstein and argue that college has never been more critical to the American nation."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"That the college experience was a matter of national obsession in the 60s and 70sis, more than anything, a reflection of a society overwhelmed by new notions of civil rights, sex, and war. It was a time of change in which the country was propelled closer to the subset of the population that always housed the largest advocates of progress: the youth."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Born into a family of six children (living in a rural area of Ohio, and being the third child) presented some financial limits to my higher education. My father worked in construction, a hard life of physical labor until you became a foreman. My mother did not complete her nurse's training prior to marriage, and worked for years in a secondary role as nurse's aide (this is the person who runs the errands, empties bedpans, gets post-surgery patients up on their feet and struggles with them down the halls. Another labor-intensive position.). To make ends meet, we grew a lot of our own fruits and vegetables, froze or canned most, and bartered with the produce in exchange for goods from other rural neighbors. My mom also made a huge percentage of our clothes, making them at night while we slept. Anything to save on money, to get by."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In 1968, over a thousand students filled Brown University's august main green and protested. They were fighting against injustice. And whether it was imagined or real, a nation gained momentum as college students across the country gathered steam and media attention by asking not what their country could do for Vietnam or plights abroad, but what they could do to change a system they saw as plagued with injustice, decadence, and escapism. Where students of the past wanted to fight, the modern student does not want to foul his own comfortable nest."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein's critique of the American university establishment went great lengths to pull apart the increasingly homogenized fabric of our academic culture. I believe he could have gone further. Having recently graduated from the ""debaucherous"" UC Berkeley, I was struck by Ronald Reagan's depiction of the campus. His concerns couldn't have been more shortsighted; in reality, I would argue that UC Berkeley represents a startling trend evident in the elite universities of this country. Contrary to Reagan's claims, the campus is not licentious, but rather, is growing increasingly conservative and homogenous. The university is no longer a bastion of liberalism and free-thinking, but an entity conforming to the same pressures it purports to resist, and the student body, faculty and academic freedom in general suffer."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Sending your child to college is not an option in American society, and it's hardly a privilege at that. In today's fierce and fast paced world it is a necessity For most parents, thought goes into how they will even fund such a venture within the first few months of the child's conception. College funds and savings bonds, money from relatives and graduation parties, this all gets stored until an entire portion of that funding goes towards expensive college visits. Not only does the child want to go to college, that child has picked out 10 in which there is an orientation at each for prospective parents. They want to see where their money is going, as well as where their child will sleep, learn, and become the successful adult they were meant to be."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"It is difficult for me to speak with any authority on behalf of the entire current American college population, especially since as a senior at New York University it is safe to assume that my own college experience is starkly different from many others, but I feel that Rick Perlstein's article ""What's the Matter with College"" denies us much of the credit we deserve. The truth of the matter is that no matter how much I am truly fascinated with the history of the late 60s and early 70s, and do genuinely admire a great deal of what they accomplished, it is their generation who has asked my peers to stand up and fight for Vietnam the Sequel, or who are at least complicit in its ugly evolution by failing to adequately challenge its conception, when they should have known better. Their participation in the Iraq War, whether active or passive, proves to some extent that they did not have it all right, and makes one wonder how much useful knowledge was actually gleaned from their experiences. To imply that we are in some way failing the college legacy because we do not now resemble them is both narcissistic and false. I believe it is my own generation's awareness of the limitations of the peace movement, combined with the fact that protesting today is no longer the radical act of defiance that it once was, that makes us tentative to emerge from the insulation of our iPod universes, and to seek change through the social movements and civil disobedience that evoked the fear and ire of California gubernatorial candidate Ronald Reagan 40 years ago."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Perlstein's accurate lamentations regarding the waning ""college experience"" are telling indictments of the sublimated and complacent status of contemporary youth culture. The question of why college students no longer represent a significant social force within macro society can best be addressed by pondering why it is that Perlstein's idyllic vision of the college experience - a deluge of hipsterdom, countercultural influences, and activism - has been transformed into a historical artifact. The answers lie in the juxtaposition of present-day and previous generation youth culture, with particular concern to the sociohistorical climate and the cultural realms of music and literature."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Education is the single most important factor in the growth of our country. Specifically, higher education paves a future and provides opportunity for students that attend college and gives them a shot at a career. 50 years ago, college was strictly for the elite, high class Americans. Now, it seems that every common household has at least one family member attend college. But with the increasing drop out rate today, students seem less interested in learning at college and their priorities change from their original goal of graduating. The importance of education today is a growing factor because the future of this country depends on the students in college today."

Glance at a bookstore's legion of standardized test review books, and you'll be confronted with just how essential college is to today's society. But as noted author Rick Perlstein observes in his article ""What's the Matter With College?"" for all the supposed importance of campus life, it attracts surprisingly little attention these days, especially when compared to its salience in the Sixties and Seventies. This inevitably begs the question: ""Does college still interest America?"""

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The problem with college is that we expected it to be as revolutionary a time as our parents' movies and songs promised it would be and, sadly, it isn't. We arrived on campus, ready to grow our hair out, desperate for anything to sit-in against, but quickly discovered that there's no single abhorrent thing worth the sit-in. We quickly found that the professors aren't reactionary at all - quite the opposite, honestly. We looked for something local we could fix, but found nothing new. There is no pressing Civil Rights battle on our campuses, there is no obvious sexual segregation. Really, the only quantifiable difference between college now and college then is that the marijuana is 17% stronger and now the Republicans smoke it too."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"There is no doubt that the college experience of today is much different from that of our parents' in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In those days, students held sit-ins against the Vietnam War, campaigned for equal rights, and listened to politically conscious musicians performing at Woodstock. Nowadays, most students are more willing to protest Friday classes and the food selection in the cafeteria than the genocide in the Sudan. While there are groups at every campus who are politically-minded, many of their peers would consider them, in Ronald Reagan's words, to be ""a noisy, dissident minority."" To some extent, self-interest has replaced the idealism of the past. No one factor, however, can explain the shift in college culture and its declining influence on mainstream American culture. A combination of many forces has shaped this change."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"A more apt assertion than ""college as America used to understand it is coming to an end"" is that America as America used to understand it has already ended. Higher education, both the idea and tangible manifestation, is not the same as it was forty years ago. But neither is the United States, or the world, for that matter. Expecting the current collegiate crowd to undergo an undergraduate experience like that of their parents is to put campus life in a formaldehyde-sealed, shrink-wrapped bubble, immune to the cultural, socio-political, economical, and technological changes of the past four decades."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The first two weeks of every semester at my school are called ""Camp Harvard."" More traditionally labeled, ""shopping period,"" these two weeks theoretically afford undergraduates the opportunity to attend eight to ten classes a week and choose which four or five they would most like to enroll in for the semester. My memories of shopping period generally include rising at an ambiguously-houred portion of the early afternoon, playing a lot of Frisbee, attending multiple themed reunion parties, getting reacquainted with dining hall food, taking more trips to Boston than I will for the rest of the semester, and generally refining my skills at loafing and leisure with the best company I can find."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The college experience and the students who lived it undeniably played a colorful and visible role in the national dialogue during the 1960s, yet student protesters, especially those that used destructive tactics, seldom played a central role in influencing public policy or popular opinion. With historian Rick Perlstein's description of the colleges as a harbor for alienated students and revolutionary thought, the question becomes whether the campus -""its own 'city state'"" and ""a place radically apart from the rest of society""-- was as central to the nation as Perlstein asserts. But by intentionally distinguishing themselves from the nation, college activists often traded pragmatism and centrality for symbolism and flare."

Reading about post-WWII and Vietnam-era university life, I find myself jealous and scorn the age into which I was born. ""Oh, to live in a time,"" I think to myself, ""when intellectuals and artists conferred over coffee and strong drink until 3 in the morning!"" To have cultural icons like Kerouac, Brando, Dylan and Lennon instead of Ashton Kutcher, Britney Spears and whoever the hell writes books these days.

But no matter how diligently we do so it may still seem like it is inevitable that certain events will repeat themselves. The Holocaust was the worst display of genocide the world had ever witnessed. So we commemorate and memorialize, but still, genocide strikes in the 1990s in Rwanda and as we speak it continues to devastate the African continent in region of Darfur. Does this mean our efforts are entirely futile? I certainly would not like to believe so. Instead, looking from a different perspective we can begin to recognize that the youth of each generation must make a conscious decision to observe or react to the events that occur during the times in which they live."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I am a child of circular reasoning. I have taken out enormous private loans to attend college. The loans are so that once I graduate I will be able to pay them back. If I were to drop-out today, I would have to pay my hundred-thousand-dollars debt immediately. I attend college so that I can afford to attend college. In many ways the noose of my debt has made me jaded and cynical and unable to directly illustrate why college matters; the fact is that it does."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The first time I ever heard about the SATs was when Zach Morris had to take them on 'Saved By the Bell.' The event came out of nowhere. There were no episodes of frantic cramming or practice tests; there was only Zach's annoyance that he was stuck in school on a Saturday morning to take it. It's a good thing I didn't build my perception of the test from that first impression, because as I would come to discover over the next few years, the SATs are a small slice of my generation's neuroticism over college and ultimately, over our future."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The 1960s, so goes the folk tale, was a time of beautiful young people with beautiful ideas, who for a fleeting moment led our country down an unprecedented path of political progression and indulgent hedonism. Here was the real American Dream: young, long-haired and shouting, marching or sitting in for change. Art imitated life: ""Four Dead In Ohio,"" sang Neil. Here was a student movement as a powerful force and a political authority so threatened by it that they were willing to kill Our Nation's Future. Four decades later, it looks like they may have succeeded."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"College mattered in 1945 when I enrolled in a state college in Pennsylvania that was predominately black. The Quakers had founded the school for ""Negro"" youths in the early 19th century for teaching manual trades and homemaking. Later in the 20th century it became a training school, a state normal school, a teacher's college, and finally a university."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In American culture, college life is somewhat of an ideal. Some of this ideal is informed by a steady stream of films since 'Animal House' which portray college as a four-year long drunken orgy, interrupted only by the occasional football game and sociology class. But most of it is informed by our parents' delusional nostalgia. My generation has been told since childhood that college is a person's only chance to enjoy the independence of adulthood without its responsibilities. It is a time of unparalleled fun, maturation, and intellectual stimulation, after which we will emerge as confident, wise, and self-aware adults with, of course, earning potentials that exceed that of our parents. In college, I've often been told, I must seize the opportunity to 'find myself.' Unfortunately, the dispensaries of this advice are often unable to adequately explain what exactly 'finding myself' entails."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Today, the college experience is more trade school, less ancient Greek academy.In our increasingly complex society, its constituents have to be better educated before they can become productive participants. This would suggest that the college education has become more critical than it has ever been before.

A time of freedom, self exploration, awareness, learning and maturing, as a nation we have put a high price tag on the college experience, and I don't just mean the cost of tuition. It separates the blue and white collars and whether you contribute to or collect money from the government. In Rick Perlstein's article ""What's the Matter With College?,"" the very question of the importance and value of a true college experience and what it should be according to Perlstein is raised. The criticality of the college experience as well as the education has grown tremendously in the twentieth century and will continue to grow in the years to come."

But I have a secret, and that is that I'm not totally convinced that college is so different from summer camp. And I have to think that there really is something wrong with that, something deeply, terribly wrong."

First the right school had to be found where a mystical symbiotic bond would be formed. Then humble applications of prostration had to be sent in, pleas to enter through their silver arches into a mythical community. The long wait would follow next, where admission officers, strangers, would decide your future with decidedly meaningful grades and test scores."

The Ivory Tower, in all of its shining glory, seen from any vantage point on the bucolic campus and heard throughout the quaint college town, asserts its hourly prominence as the bells toll. College."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"My high school and college graduation pictures look surprising similar. Same awkwardly positioned four-corner hat, same blue-and-gold colored tassel, same happy smile obscured by a mouth full of braces. Judging by looks alone it might appear that little has changed in the four years between the two ceremonies. But if I try to think back to those high school days, it seems like a different lifetime. A time when I wasn't always trying to fit my life into a suitcase every summer so that I could move into a new dorm room or apartment. A time when I didn't automatically refer to my teachers as ""doctor"" or ""professor."" And a time when I would never start a sentence with the word ""and"" because high school English teachers have a problem with it. But college is above those kinds of rules, it's liberating. It's a chance not only to become more independent, but also to be exposed to a higher level of knowledge or a different view of a subject that will hopefully leave you with a new respect for how much humans have achieved. Even more importantly, it's a chance for you to hide from the ""real world"" under the title of ""student"" for one last time while you figure out where exactly you fit into society and what you want to do with your life. So while the university experience may differ across generations, I think that it will always play an important role in shaping the lives of young adults."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I hadn't gone to my Intro to Psychology class more than three times over the course of the semester. In fact, since I'd never bothered to buy the required texts, I found myself sitting noteless, bookless, and - I thought - helpless on the night before the final exam. After convincing a friend to lend me his books for two hours, I rabidly skimmed every reading assignment we'd be given, taking notes as best I could. After I returned the books, I bunkered down at my desk and studied everything I had compiled until four in the morning. At seven o'clock I got up, studied for another half hour, guzzled a coffee, and went into the exam room. There must've been two hundred of us there, and after spending thirty minutes of our allotted two hours on guesswork, I decided to get up and leave. I was the first person to hand in my test, and I had by that point concluded that I was going to fail my first college course. Somehow, and I'm still convinced as a result of a clerical error, I received a B in the course. I knew almost nothing about psychology."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I'm not sure that I would have put the time or thought necessary to write this essay had it been offered during the time when I attend college. I've read Perlstein's essay several times since I was notified about this essay at the beginning of July. Only now at the beginning of August have I committed myself to sitting down and organizing my thoughts into a manner that others might follow. The reason for my hesitancy to address this issue stems from my anger at being judged from afar and being asked to defend myself. When Perlstein asks ""What's the Matter with College?"" I read ""What's the Matter With College Students?"". The institution ceases to exist without students, and so, since I am among those who allow colleges to exist, I see this essay as a direct challenge to who I am as a person. ""Is the college experience less critical to the nation than it was a generation ago?"" It is patently absurd to define the ""college experience"" when you consider the plethora of diversity among individuals attending college today. This was obviously not so in the 1960's, and there is no common denominator for comparing the events of the '60's with the events of today."

I look up at the massive structure that is Gillett Hall, my home for the next year, and I feel like I've just been plopped into an Alex Kotlowitz book. With twenty-year old window units hanging out of most rooms in a forty-year old building, it does not make for a reassuring sight to a kid from the Chicago suburbs. To cement the Henry Horner housing projects imagery is a basketball court next to the building, on which every player is black. This is more than just a minor change from where I came from, where my idea of diversity used to be the half-black, half-Filipino Barack Obama-wannabe at my high school. Into the fortress I go, and up to my floor in a (yay!) working elevator. I walk down a hallway that can only be described as a fluorescent tomb, and my hopes and expectations fall by the second. I spot what I think is a puke stain just a few steps from my door, but it blends so effortlessly with the brownish carpet that I can't safely say what it is. At the fourth door down the hallway, I come upon my room: 434. I open the door and drop my bags, and with them go my jaw. I had known before this day the exact dimensions of the room, but in person, the 11 x 13 foot room is somehow even smaller than I had previously imagined. Out from behind me steps my dad, who gives a soft laugh and says, ""I guess some things never change."""

I have had a difficult time avoiding my own criticisms of the opinions and observations voiced in ""What's the Matter with College"" and sticking to the task of arguing ""Why College Matters"". But, my own self-awareness and that of many of my peers is only the beginning of the answer to why college, an experience that so many of us truly value, really matters."

I wanted nothing more than to feign sleep and calm my nerves over whether I'd make my connecting flight in Chicago for my final destination in Des Moines.

I have been told this same statement since I was six years old, whether from a teacher, my parents, or a public service announcement on television. Knowledge certainly is power, and the more you know, the further in life you can go. But it simply is not this simple anymore. The knowledge of today needs to be backed up by a degree or two from a well-known and respected institution. Knowledge for knowledge's sake is wonderful, but knowledge with a B.A., B.S., J.D., M.B.A., or Ph.D. behind it is more likely to pay the bills and obtain status. Bacon went to college for two years, joined the staff of England's ambassador to France, and went on to become a Member of Parliament. That was then. This is now; two years in college may get you a low-paying, low-prestige career, but certainly not one close to the likes of Parliament."

Slowly students begin to creep inside the building, down the hall, down the stairs, and out of the auditoriums. The time has come. There will be ten minutes between classes for me and my colleagues to go into the swarm of students and make as many people aware of our campaign and why it's important to ensure that University of Michigan apparel is not made in sweatshops. The results are minimal. A girl wearing Uggs enters the building, sees me with a flier and clipboard, and walks faster to avoid me. So does the young man wearing his fraternity letters, the punk rocker with his headphones, the stoner with dreadlocks and the hunched-over engineer. Those that I manage to talk to, nod their heads nonchalantly and look around to see if they see their friends, occasionally glancing at their wristwatch.

We are living in a society where wealth, stature, and fame are the ultimate goals in life. The reason that college matters so much is that it frees us from these questions; or at least it should. College ought to give us the tools to be free."

College has become so ingrained in our society, we expect everyone to go or to have gone. Many jobs require that the applicant have a degree in their particular field. Thus, in order to get that perfect job, college is a must. And it's not just about the career. College has become an indication of status. We express more interest in and tend to think higher of those who have gone to the ivy leagues than those who have gone to community college. Those who didn't even go to college we place at the bottom of the social ladder. True, there have been cases of people who have gone on to become successful and highly admired in our society (Steve Jobs, a college dropout, comes to mind). However, these are the exceptional few, whose talents and skills have surpassed the need for college. The majority of us, however, need college to reach our goals."

Rick Perlstein effectively encapsulated this concept in his article What's the Matter with College? with the statement: ""College as America used to understand it is coming to an end."" As an upcoming senior at one of America's universities, I cannot say that I could fully appreciate the understanding of college in 1969 as compared to that which I have of college today. However, when asked to contemplate the problem with college in an attempt to evaluate our current understanding of it, I found that I was addressing the wrong question. It is my contention that the query should not be 'what's the matter with college', but rather, more essentially, 'what's the matter with our understanding of college'.

I got a combined SAT score of 1500 and applied to a total of three colleges chosen primarily on the basis of family history and the ""prestige factor"" (Harvard, Princeton, etc...). I don't stand out in any statistics and no admissions offices are scrambling over themselves to fill the ""upper-middle class Caucasian woman"" quota... so I guess you could say I'm that faceless college student that we're all competing against, the overachiever that threatens us with their well-rounded resume and impressive GPA. I'm everyone's worst nightmare, just like every other college student with their original ideas and their up-'n-at-'em attitude are incentives for making my own collegeexperience a living hell. Mr. Perlstein asked, 'What's wrong with colleges today?' I reply that the rat race mentality has poisoned the intellectual atmosphere of our nation's universities and turned ""college"" into just another cog in the societal machine that rushes us into our graves on the 9-to-5-shift assembly line. Instead of being leaders of our national culture, the college-agecohort has been demoted to the bottom of the corporate ladder, and as college students we're all battling for the next promotion."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I woke up this morning, poured myself a bowl of Grape-Nuts, and sat down in front of my computer to watch a video over the Internet of an Iranian woman being stoned to death. I was a bit queasy, a bit unsettled, but certainly engaged by the footage. I could have just as easily read up on the footage at any number of news websites, human rights blogs, news channels with multiple shows and personalities - or I could have passed a glance at a headline in a newspaper: ""IRANIAN WOMAN STONED WITHOUT REMORSE."" The event is not particularly news to me. Not in the sense that I have come to expect it (a sensibility I would have indeed come to have exercised, given a literally never-ending deluge of information about such events), but rather in that it has simply lost its interest, its engagement, its flash of relevance in my significantly less afflicting life. I realize now that I have been desensitized to the rapid flow of information not because of the content itself, but because of its close-wed relationship to the laurels upon which the college generation of the Vietnam-era America had established for the future of academia, and it is here as a college student that I can attest to the change of college as I envisioned it in America's fabric to the lived reality of it. Rick Perlstein writes in What's the Matter With College? that College has fallen in strength due to the apathy felt among students towards the very distinct changes from high school and post college life, viewing it with an obfuscated sense of their lives' great times. College is supposed to be the springtime of one's life; a season that has been muddled into a haze by Perlstein's account, citing the many students who have come to resent their collegiate experience. The article does justice to the one socially relevant concern - ""What happened to College?"" - to me and my have been wondering, as well as exposing the large rift between the Vietnam- and Iraq-era concepts of College. Information and its rapid flow - often considered to be one of the defining characteristics of this generation - have served to inform a surge of people in the world to come to maintain keen awareness of its vitality and importance in their lives - or they could maintain a keen façade. The progressive template of the students of the 60's and 70's has come to feel to large to the students of the yet unnamed00's (yet unnamed, appropriately enough) due in large part to this desensitization to information and, tragically enough, the most prevalent of indicators for the generation to come. The loss of bona fide Collegiate intrigue is found in the advent of Internet 2.0 and the role of global events and current activity in forming the character of the current College generation."

While we acknowledge the value of these skills we also want to highlight the fact that some skills necessary for personal and professional growth and advancement can only be acquired through formal education, namely college and it is an unarguable fact that most technical skills become out dated and sometimes redundant as time passes. A higher level of education never will, but the knowledge and skills acquired through such a diverse curriculum and environment would only be sharpened through extensive use."

For in this moment rests an ideal so strong in conviction and certainty that it holds the power to scale walls that divide people, erase oppression with the point of a pencil, and feed hunger with two gentle hands. Possibility- no greater an inspiration can cross our hearts. For here, right now we hold the ability to mold that ten letter word into the pages of history."

However, I feel obligated to shed some light as to why Mr. Perlstein's romanticized idea of what college should be like is not possible for every student. The period of self expression and experimentation of ideas during four years between the ages of 18 and 22 is a fairytale scenario for the masses. This blissful journey through college where students have time to read books like Measure for Measure in dorm common rooms and have intellectual discussions of what Shakespeare's true message was, is not for everyone. Yes, college today is connected with real world issues and students study boring topics (to some) like business. College being practical should not be a novel concept. With the price of higher education today, parents only hope that their children are learning up to date education and not skipping class to discuss classic works of fiction. Immigrant parents, at least mine, are forever advising their children to work hard and obtain a degree that will secure a job after college. I could never dream of studying music, dance or theatre because to my parents, those careers are merely hobbies. I was meant to ""be a lawyer, a doctor or a diplomat!"" my mother always said. College has evolved. It is becoming an integrated learning experience and not the intellectual safe-haven it used to be."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"When I got in, no one from my high school had gone to ColumbiaUniversity in four years. It was like a dream to me: a school thatmy grandpa calls a ""communist university,"" where I knew I would notencounter a single person from my high school for at least a year.For my four years of high school I had to endure the torture that isKellenberg Memorial. I was one of the few left wing students at theschool, and was not very popular because I insisted on challengingmy teachers, who often were not very subtle about theirconservative politics."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I'll begin by admitting: I bought into it. I ""was swindled"" by those savvy marketing strategies, which Rick Perlstein discovers at the end of his article, ""What's the matter with college?"" Put simply, college has lost its intrinsic value as an institution and continues to search for the lucky students whom they will impress and extend the invitation of admittance."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"How exciting! Encouragement and intellectual space provided by a prestigious publication for me to vent about ""the college experience,"" or ""finding myself"" - three years of my life in an institution that has disappointed me. Instead of blossoming into a renaissance man exposed to the ideas and possibilities of the world, some promise of college I must have imagined, I feel as though I've been reduced to a specialized component of a larger society whose goal is to innovate, produce, consume, repeat. As I write here at this sidewalk café in San Francisco, having spent my summer couch-surfing and dumpster-diving as an amateur anthropologist and cultural critic, I wonder if I should drop out of Stanford."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"College. I dread the day it will begin. Why must we be subjected to this institution as the only other option is to be unsupported by our own parents and our very own Corporate State. Yes ladies and gentlemen, America has betrayed us. We are not living in a society of absolute freedom and liberty. We are disillusioned as such, but as we enter our teenage years, our once thoughtful, expectant hopes of bright futures slowly fade to the misery of the reality we are about to face."

If I haven't hit a Starbucks before I arrive at work (there are two on my way), I stop first at the industrial coffee maker in the break room. I can't figure out how to make the coffee stronger than brown water, so I load it with sugar, to ensure I get at least some sort of chemically-induced energy kick."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Who says college doesn't matter anymore? Not my peers. Not our parents. Sure, it's no longer an issue that wins or loses campaigns, but for many people of my generation, college is the culmination of the first eighteen years of life, the pinnacle of our youth. The reason why we spent three hours a week for four years slaving away at a local soup kitchen? The reason why we founded that high school literary magazine? The reason why, at our parents' urging, we enrolled in AP Biology, Calculus, and Government? College. Or rather, college admissions."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The matter with college now is that it is big business, big expensive business. Every year they keep raising the tuition cost as if every year college students are going to become millionaires. Well I have been in college for three year and I'm still not a millionaire. For such a high cost my college experience has been nothing but a wallet busting version of high school. You still have the test and the papers and the teachers who either don't know what they are doing or need to retire, but now that you're in college you get to have a huge loan attached to your name when you graduate or should I say if you graduate."

""Boston University is a better school for you and I'm worried you'll have trouble focusing in California."" Focusing on what?"

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In his essay titled, ""What's the Matter with College"", author and historian Rick Perlstein asserted that college campuses have ""lost their centrality"" and are a declining social and political force in contemporary American society. While Perlstein was certainly correct in assuming that the institution of college as it has been known in recent decades is coming to an end, the ways that college has changed have put it on a new and intensely centralized pedestal. From reading about the intellectual and offbeat haven that Perlstein described as having been college past and discussing with others that attended and did not attend college in that generation, it is obvious how the college that the young adults of today's generation enjoy is exceedingly different from that of their parents."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,The answer to Rick Perlstein's question--what's the matter with college?--is actually quite simple. Students don't care. They don't care--and they don't dare.
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"When I began studying at Hendrix College, I remember the seniors complaining about how everything was different when they were freshmen. They had even channeled their angst into t-shirt form with the catchy slogan ""I remember when Hendrix was cool."" Of course, we freshmen were not allowed to buy them; after all, we didn't remember when Hendrix was cool. What we thought was cool was actually the watered-down college experience given to us by a tyrannical administration. This year, however, I'm a senior, and I received word that someone in my class (without any sense of irony) was trying to revive this concept and sell the shirts themselves. So has my college really degenerated so much in four years that the graduating senior class has to constantly redefine what is ""cool""? More importantly: has college as a whole?"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"As colleges and universities nationwide train the future All-Stars of the American workforce, today's society witnesses a kind of intense academic focus to which past generations were unaccustomed.

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In the article ""What's the Matter with College"" Rick Perlstein largely blames American Colleges for the lost of centrality in the lives of undergraduates and the wider society in the present era. In the past college campus has played a central role in shaping American society. However, this has dwindled in recent years. This dwindling was brought about by the changes in the perception of the institution, parent and the student as to what college attainment should be."

Those were heady times and,like other exciting periods in history we imagine what we might have donehad we lived then. Your college years, however, were in the eighties,during the Reagan administration, a time notorious for student apathy. Whenyou attended college, the economy was booming and students, in general,were as career oriented and self-absorbed as you claim we are today.You interviewed some beatniks and hippies nostalgically reliving theirglory days by telling you stories of how they argued with famous poets andskipped class to participate in 'rap sessions' intended to mastermind the'revolution.' The revolution they planned never came to fruition; insteadthey left us a legacy of activism wherein students feel responsible forwhat goes on in society."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Although I share many of Rick Perlstein's concerns regarding college, he seems to have lost perspective on the most important issue. Mr. Perlstein ignores the incredible opportunities for learning and edification still presented by the college experience, going far beyond its perception as only a prerequisite for a good job. I can personally attest to these opportunities, the experiences that can unlock a passion for learning in otherwise cynical and jaded college students."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Young adults are fed by change. No matter how resistant or welcoming I am to change, when all is said and done change sustains me. Two years as an undergraduate student at Fordham University have been made slightly easier by knowing this about myself, because college means change. Even with the still shrinking cyber community and the 'real world' opportunities offered to many young people today, nothing can replace the rush of change attached to the college experience."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Henry Adams at the turn of the last century wrote that if college had encouraged the integrity of character needed to succeed in life, ""it would have been education better worth having than mathematics or languages; but so far as it helped to make anything, it helped only to make the college standard permanent through life."" This from a man who graduated as the Class Orator from Harvard; he got a very good education. What was missing from it is again missing today. Adams was alluding to the ""negative force"" of American college education: the damage of having no education in how to think independently or know oneself, instead jumping miles of purely intellectual hurdles. After bounding them all with as few blunders as possible, the student stands on the other side of the BA or BS cue; and then isn't trained to decide for himself what the best career is: he gets into a new line of pre-set jumps that his friend, or father, or other source recommended, that will extend in the future far enough. His job keeps him busy while taking breaks for real life along the way; it is a continuation of how he learned to treat life in college."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"American author Reynolds Price once astutely asserted, ""I always say the late 60s, early 70s in American education were really exciting times to teach. The late 70s, on the other hand, were awfully dull. People tended to be quiet and repressed and all headed off to business school or something."" A generation ago, college was an institution, where only a select group of individuals, from the wealthiest upper echelons of society could afford to attend. Devoid of the economic burden, these students were exposed to coming of age experiences vastly different from the children of the average 1950s all-American family and were free to expand their minds. But, today, more and more students from all realms of society are attending college than ever recorded and these new students are singing a different tune. College today is as necessary, if not more crucial to the future of young adults like myself than a generation ago, but for the majority of students it has been reduced to a mere career-training ground, a steppingstone for the ""Real World""."

Every generation, it seems, must spill its share of ink in worried, nostalgic, backward-looking essays and articles. Every generation frets that the next generation doesn't seem quite up to the task of making the world move.

Pressing the boundary of known independence not for the gratification of being the rebel without a cause but the satisfaction of being apart of a movement. Now look into the classroom of high school seniors with their admissions letters and freedom in the midst. Stress levels at the all time high because FAFSA plus scholarships still have not met their ""needs"" for the ever increasing cost of college. Blame it on the rap music, MTV, BET, VHI, and video games for the lack of activism from the college students. Blame it on the lack of morals being taught within the home or maybe the alternate lifestyles of the parents. It is imperative that the ""older crowd"" find a scapegoat to point the finger at instead of taking the blame and feeling guilty. Could this notion be the answer to all of life's problems? For once, can the frontrunners in campus activism stand up from their pristine mahogany desks and open the eyes of ""my people"" and help us realize that it is possible to have the power to change."

I will graduate from Marist College next year, with my diploma serving as a bittersweet reminder of my ambivalence towards the institution. College, for me, has not been the unique social experience promised by parents, teachers and administrators. Perhaps I did not venture far enough from my native Long Island. Maybe I did not select a school that offered me sufficient academic challenges. Most likely I would have felt the same way anywhere else."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The noise that was made during the 1960's is still echoed across college campuses today. The spirit of gaining knowledge and being exposed to new things is still alive. Similar to the state of the American media, Universities in the United States are changing form. This does not mean that they are any less effective than they once were. America as well as the world as a whole has changed since the 1960's. In order to remain effective, an educational system must change with the times."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Absolutely, the college experience is less important than it was a generation ago, but conversely the experience you gain from college is indispensable when one leaves college for the work force. Quite simply, the college experience as our parents knew it has become obsolete. As Perlstein hints, the internet has replaced college as the main way to find out about ""taboo"" subjects. College students don't need to go to college anymore to expand their cultural awareness--they can do so in their bedrooms at a lower cost (after all, surfing the Net doesn't cost one thousands of dollars a semester). The ""generation gap"" as the boomers define it, has also changed. A generation ago, your parents were your parents; they saw their job as parenting, disciplining, and the like. Thus, this provided ample ground for generation gap confrontations. You went to college, and experienced things your parents didn't let you see, do things your parents didn't let you do. But somewhere along the line parents stopped being parents--they became friends, providers. When you have been provided for, your every whim indulged, why rebel against your parents. Our generation doesn't hate our parents, and we don't want to; our generation doesn't want to rebel. We're busy wrapped up in our own little lives, which have been cultivated by our parents. The idea of rebellion is foreign, mostly because it would involve leaving a security bubble that many of our generation have existed in since they were born."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Large-scale political dissent, heated philosophical debates in smoky dorm rooms, and rebellion against the conservative mores of financial gain and capitalism may be difficult to spot on most college campuses today, but that cannot be construed as a sign that college has lost its relevance to American culture, that students no longer care about the power a college education gives them, or that concern about the goings on at college campuses stopped when building takeovers did. Preoccupation with, and anxiety about college are rampant in the United States. Read any news publication for one week, and I guarantee there will be an article about college. But instead of it being a piece decrying the falling moral standards at our nations top educational institutions, as it would have been forty years ago, it will be a mournful article about how expensive college is, or a haughty one about how selective it is, or a human interest story about a student who is the first in her family to attend college."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In Rick Perlstein's article ""What's The Matter with College"", he asserts that the discrete college experience, a time and place separate from everything that came before and everything that would follow after, no longer exists. As a current undergraduate, I have to agree. In most ways, college life for me has been an extension of my high school years and simultaneously the start of my immersion into the infamous ""real world."" Instead of disassociating myself from the friends, interests, and beliefs I had before college, I, along with most of my fellow classmates, are building on what came before college. We are also looking ahead to what will come after, which often translates to our professional lives. As Perlstein points out, for those who came of age in the cataclysmic 1960s and 1970s, the college experience of today often seems tame and even depressing. After all, to the outside eye my generation is not breaking down entrenched social barriers or reshaping the political landscape like my parents' generation did. We appear to stand for little and act on even less. Mostly, we seem disaffected and unaware of the troubles facing our country and world. My challenge to anyone who feels that way is to take another look. For, while the college experience now is not the distinct time and place that it once was, it is most certainly revolutionizing America."

College did not play a large cultural role in determining the national consciousness because higher education was accessible to so few. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, colleges provided the proper environment for a cultural revolution to take place. More students were attending college, making going to school attractive and exciting. The Vietnam War, the draft, and the fight towards racial integration provided students with issues that they cared deeply about and that affected them personally. Many students were away from home for the first time. Large numbers of young, energetic, like-minded individuals collected in places away from traditional authority. An American counterculture spread forth from college campus, allowing students to collectively create a new common consciousness."

Of course, American culture in itself was a web of exciting opportunity An intricate amalgam of what we had not experienced and bolstered what we yearned to experience. In the ""old days,"" you had to go out into the world to seek the information you desired. When you were younger, if you wanted to cut your teeth on some of those colossi of the adult elite, you couldn't simply point and click your way to enlightenment; you had to earn your fangs through the rigors of social symmetry. And what better place to equip yourself with a new armament of knowledge than the classic college experience an almost trademarked phrase that is almost accentuated with the promise of maturity and success. In this country at least, college was where you were destined to shirk off the shackles of high school and truly learn a thing or two about how those wiser heads were cooler heads."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Exactly. College as America used to understand, indeed, is coming to an end. Not only so, what college used to be in the past decades must come to an end.

My home--all 124 square feet of it--grows lonelier as drunken song and sophomoric second-hand smoke slither through the slits of my window and into my sphere. There is no reason for further investigation. There are no surprises here in the second most populous dormitory north of the Mason-Dixon line. Just another property of the largest private university in America, another forgettably ugly, unforgivably enormous medium-security prison boasting the compulsory violet flag that ripples through the bitter winds of winter.

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Last Fall, when a hundred and fifty students at The Cooper Union in New York City staged a sit-out, the protestors who made up the loosely organized crowd wondered to each other how long the protest might last and how successful it ultimately might be. Should the protest be suspended over night? Would the sit-out carry through the weekend? A resolution came more quickly than anyone anticipated: by late afternoon the Dean of Students announced that the President, George Campbell, who had earlier made a reluctant and sheepish appeal to the crowd of students, agreed to meet the demands of the protest. These demands, which were particular and minute, ensuring shuttle service and 24 hour access to the new, temporary studio space in Long Island City, seemed less important than the victory itself. Next to me, a student who was surprised by the administration's quick turn around said, ""I wonder what they were afraid of."""
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In the article ""What's the Matter with College,"" Rick Perlstein proposes that today's college students don't seem to be rallying around the great social issues of the day in the way that previous generations' undergraduates did. Perlstein specifically addresses the climate of college in the 1960s and 1970s. By contrasting the ways in which students interacted and joined in the public debate in those decades with what he sees as indifference from many modern college students, Perlstein presents a view of contemporary campus life as a wasteland of moderation caused by the system's infantilizing of today's students and rampant commercialization of the college experience. Plainly, as universities seek to broaden their appeal and reap financial benefits from the intellectual property they sow, American culture suffers."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"College is not what it used to be. College as we used to define it is definitely coming to an end. The manner in which colleges were used before is not the way we use them now. This, however, is not a reason to point the finger at university campuses. Just like the building some call home is not the central focus of their life, but the customs of their families and the culture they were raised in are, so university campuses are not he focus of the college experience, but the culture in which they grow and have an impact on is. Student life has not become unimportant, instead, it has become more important - that is why there is an increasing interest in having students live on campus. The college experience continues to be critical to today's generation of college students, in a different sense, but it still matters."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"When I began college at the University of Mississippi in the fall of 2004, I did not expect too much change from my high school experience. Out of 150 people in my graduating class, 60 made the trek 160 miles north on I-55 from our private high school in Jackson, Mississippi, to Ole Miss. I felt more than adequately prepared for college work. My high school courses were primarily Advanced Placement courses, and I had earned over 24 college credits as a result. But when I graduated this past May, I realized how provincial my outlook was coming into college and how much more nuanced and global my perspective was as a result of not only three years of studying English and classics but also three years of studying the ironies and complexities of my university, my state, and our world."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I suspect that to the incoming college student, there are few phrases more ominous than the thought that ""college as America used to understand it is coming to an end."" College, after all, is the end to which we have devoted our thoughts and directed our studies toward over the last four years. More importantly, it represents to us the next four years to come. For the class of 2007, the pipe dream of college has not yet dissolved into the quotidian banality of small dorms and stressful classes. For us - and perhaps, only us - the undergraduate experience remains nebulous and glimmering. Unburdened by reality, it still seems fraught with the possibilities tangibly encapsulated in hastily-purchased school sweatshirts and an acceptance letter, heavily creased from being read too many times. What can I say? We're excited."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Instead of spending second semester junior year in Pennsylvania, I studied abroad, along with forty percent of my class at Bryn Mawr College.

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The issue of whether the college experience of today's students is the same as it was thirty years ago is not up for debate. Unfortunately, due to the influx of technological advancements during the last quarter of a century and to the rising societal pressure on individuals to obtain a four-year degree, going to college is no longer seen as something one does to experience something new and exciting, but as a stepping stone for securing a place in the working world, hopefully with a full benefits package including health care coverage."

These children have the determination to study; however, they need the support from their own country. There is no debate whether the United States is focusing enough on universities and community colleges. The question that brought up my mind ever since my high school senior year in government class was, ""Should education be managed entirely by the state government or the national government?"" Then, after reading an article in the New York Times Magazine about the how the universities in California helped shape the politics, economy, and culture of the state, the question in my mind suddenly changed into, ""Should the United States increase their focus on universities and community colleges?"""
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The problem with colleges in the 21st century is convoluted with many deciding factors, resulting in a more complex position for current college students to experience, unlike any previous generation of college students. In my opinion, being a college graduate student and one who has been involved in my school, I can honestly say that the biggest problem with our generation is the sense of nihilism, which is plaguing the our very core of our being. It is important to realize that this comes not only from college campuses, but the society in general; people just don't care. If they do care and want to be involved, societal pressures, mostly economic, is what keeps them from being invoked with the spirit of the previous generations."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Why does college matter? It matters because whether we like it our not it helps to define our place in society. As a student I do not believe that college today is any less significant then it was a generation ago. I do however believe that the role college plays in our lives is much different than it was in years prior. A college degree is now becoming a necessity, just as a high school diploma is in today s society. In order to even be considered for what society may consider to be a good job, a college degree is required. Students are no longer attending college for enlightenment, they are attending because they have no other choice."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I went to Vassar because of Wendy Wasserstein. More accurately, I went to Vassar because of ""The Heidi Chronicles."" I'd read the play in 10th grade English and had fallen head-over-heels for Heidi. I was all but alone in my adoration though. My high school- a mahogany bastion of conservatism and white privilege- was populated largely by WASPs and Young Republicans. Unsurprisingly, neither group warmed to a play about a feminist Art History professor, her gay best friend, and a self-satisfied Jew. A Jew and a feminist in my own right, I was entranced. And so, when it came time to start looking at colleges, I remembered Heidi Holland. Probably not the best reason to pick a college, but surely not the worst either."

Rule 1: Don't do anything stupid that employers won't like, such as fail a class, get arrested, or join the ACLU. Rule 2: Make yourself stand out to interviewers by doing more pointless crap than the next guy. Rule 3: Don't waste your time with anything that involves emotion or creativity. That stuff is for wimps and won't get you hired."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"My dad sent me Rick Perlstein's recent article, ""What's the Matter with College,"" pointing out that the comment about the ""kid"" who picked up her cell phone to talk to her father for 15 minutes could easily have been about me. I'm a University of Chicago student, and I talk to my parents every other day. I don't see a problem with this; I think it's a benefit of all my parents' generation did to break down some of the generation gap. I don't think they should be punished for that. I know I can become independent while still considering my parents two of my best friends. Their advice and love have helped me a lot while I've tried to become my own person."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I have a confession: I'm a college senior, and I've never officially protested anything. I actually consider myself an activist, which only makes my confession all the more disturbing. I care about issues. I vote. I've even donated to campaigns. But I've never worn a sandwich sign. This bothers me not because I long to be a child of the 60s and wear decorative peace emblems, but because I see college as a time to encounter the world. When I look at my parents' generation, I can see a very tangible way in which they met society."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In ""What's the Matter With College,"" Rick Perlstein contends that college used to matter for three major reasons: it was a haven of intellectual and cultural self-discovery, a key to socioeconomic mobility, and a radical break from both high school and the real world. Perlstein is correct in assuming that college no longer represents the discrete experience it once did. However, he does not account for the fact that it no longer should. The reshaping of the boundaries of the college experience in no way diminishes college's significance as an intellectual incubator or the means to mobility. College still matters: if anything, it matters more today."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I am about to prove Rick Perlstein (What's the Matter with College?) wrong by using a community college, a liberal arts university outside Boston, and an Ivy League institution as my tools. College matters because it is what you make of it. That's what it has been, that's what it is, and that's what it always will be. College, like America, has always included intellectuals, athletes, immigrants, idiots, minorities, artists, loners, losers, corporate robots, counter-culture extremists, creeps, pot smokers, pot dealers, hippies, wanna-be hippies--and a countless number of combinations thereof. I would even argue that college is becoming more of an experience these days, compared to ""the"" college experience (as though there were only one) of the 1960s and 1970s (herein referred to as ""the 1960s"" for brevity's sake)."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"So it's our war, is it?"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"College today is vastly different than it was in the 1960's and because of that mainstream America is just not all that interested in campuses. That's the point Rick Perlstein hopes to prove in his New York Times piece ""What's the Matter with College?"" It's a point that isn't really all that revolutionary, lest of all from someone nostalgically recalling their own college days. Sure, readers are shown that students today are more career-obsessed than their parents but what really matter is why students have changed and how that change might actually be beneficial to a knowledge society."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Until a few years ago, I would have argued with anyone who insisted that a college education was essential. Even now I would argue that a college degree is no more than a congratulatory rubber stamp on the completion of four years at any given institution. But a college degree and a college education are not necessarily one and the same. As an 18 year old entering college, one has already completed 12 continuous years of schooling. He or she is not looking at college in terms of education for education's sake, but rather for what other opportunities, e.g. Social, athletic, or career, might present themselves. That and a small piece of paper which indicates that you are now ""educated"" and competent enough to join the work force is the primary focus. This is no different today than it was 32 years ago, when I first entered college. What is different is the level of sophistication that accompanies a college freshman. Gone is the wide-eyed wonder and blatant innocence worn by the matriculating student of the 60's and 70's. Then, for many, it was the first time away from home and the only connection to the familiar was Ma Bell or the US Postal Service. College became home, and friends became family. The education was certainly there, but it was so much more than classes and exams. It was the student center, and the gymnasium, the playing fields and the pub. It was your life."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The change of American colleges and universities from a place of intellectual curiosity and cultural transformation is the result of college going from a unique and individually rewarding experience to a common commodity.

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein is right; college has changed since he went to school.

The days of college being a place of self-discovery and activism are over. Our generation doesn't look at college as a place for self-discovery like Perlstien does but it is more essential than ever before and it's all his generations fault."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The issue with universities now, when compared to the 1960's and 70's, is the value of information, and the expectations of the over all social climate. The 60's and 70's were a time of revolutions and of changes in social understanding and acceptance. The majority of students old enough to go to college weren't attending, and those who did go had to struggle with the bureaucracy which many of their peers were fighting against. The college scene was transformed from the classic scholarly image, to the image of change and reform, hence playing a large part in the social integration that occurred."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Why vote or otherwise be politically active? Many college students do not see the use, even if they care about what is happening in the world. The culture inside the Beltway is largely culpable for this widespread political apathy amongst today's undergraduates. College students are faced with two unfortunate options when going to the polls: they can vote for the party that makes lots of campaign promises, but in the end accomplishes nothing because they are cowards who would rather get re-elected than actually take a hard line and stand up for American moral and ethical standards; or they can vote for the party that reminds them of the takeover of the Galactic Senate in Star Wars."

We are well aware that Benjamin can no longer hope to fit in with his old life. College has changed him, and it is apparent - at least, to everyone in the theater. His family, senseless, has no concept of how he's changed, or of how college has made his old life seem small and pale. He has been made bigger, while they have stayed the same size. Who could expect him to return to his old home and be satisfied?"

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"During a recent dinner with friends of my parents, the conversation turned bemusedly to what my postgraduate plans were and what I was going to do with my ""soft"" major, philosophy. As I embarrassingly explained my lack of desire to actualize the next 20 years of my life before the end of freshman year of college, I realized that I was in the minority. It was almost a running gag in high school that every highly motivated student had planned out most of his or her adult life or simply was in denial. In a time where our parents ""understand"" us and try to figure out what is truly best for us, it seems as if our own responsibility for discovering what we find truly important has been taken away. Rick Perlman states that College was aimed at our parents. If that is to be believed, perhaps it is true that this generation has not been given the freedom to chart our own course. The spirit of college in which both personal and intellectual beliefs were tested with the spirit of eval uative curiosity has been pushed aside in favor of a careerist aesthetic."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"College campuses are certainly not the same today as they were when baby boomers filled their lecture halls. But how could they be? Campuses aren't the same as they were a decade ago so comparing a technology-based campus of the new millennium to one of the slide ruled, protests filled ones of the 1960s is irrelevant. The country as a whole has changed drastically and along with it so have its universities. The typical ""hippie fashioned"" undergrad of forty years ago would not find it an easy transition into cell phone, iPod dominated campuses today. It was a different breed that attended college during those times. Certainly, it wasn't as necessary then as it is now to have a degree. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard to become the wealthiest man in the world. While that may seem like an exception to the rule, it is, but only to a limited degree. To drop out of school and build a billion dollar fortune is rare to say the least but many people who either dropped out or did not attend college during the 60s and 70s went on to lead successful lives. It's safe to say that they went on to lead lucrative careers that would not be possible today without college degrees."

I talked about my semester in Germany, my recent completion of the LSAT and my following-day departure to Houston for a summer internship as a journalist. Lauren had her own updates: upon earning her accounting degree, she had turned her college internship at Ford into a full-time job and was house-hunting in the northeast Detroit area."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"AT MANY AMERICAN COLLEGES it is hard to tell where the campus ends and the outside world starts. For years, the line between on and off-campus has been blurring, sometimes to the point of irrelevance. For parents accompanying their children across this indistinct border today, I imagine that a dose of nostalgia must no doubt be mixed with a hefty helping of genuine shock. Where are the protesters? No hunger strikes or marches? No barricades or tear gas? On many campuses even the time-honored Frisbee toss is on the way out and the newer dormitories proudly bear the designation ""Riot Proof."" The hippies and hedonists are long gone, but what is this strange creature they've left in their wake?"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"There has been a great loss in the level of activism among college students since the turbulent 1960s. Complacency reigns over the people. Today's twenty-something, anarchist-punk, bicycle-messenger population is dwindling. Those that have survived are crestfallen."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Growing up I had always attended small, independent schools. My mother, being an independent school teacher, was a firm believer in the environment provided by private education. The high school I went to attempted to send into a changing world confident young people of integrity who think critically and creatively while embracing the joy of lifelong learning. Most of my classmates headed to elite institutions on the East Coast, to tiny private colleges through the Midwest, or to research departments in California. I was the only student who packed up my bags to head to the big state school: The Ohio State University. I did not know what to expect: would my classes have twenty students or two hundred, where would my roommate be from, and would I even be able graduate in four years? Nevertheless, I knew that the price was right, and that the first quarter tuition was already paid, so I packed my bags and headed to school in September."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"College is a subject highly talked about in the world today. Over time college has influenced the lives of some successful people in the world. College is an opportunity to conform yourself to a capitalistic society. Everyone meets a point in their life, when they have to choose what it is they're going to commit to for the sake of their future. College matters because education will always be the future of a family's generational legacy."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I recently completed my undergraduate college coursework at Virginia Wesleyan College. I chose Wesleyan because with my Liberal Arts background, it seemed a perfect fit. All of my credits transferred in, so I began there as a junior, with 30 credits remaining for my bachelor's degree. I was returning to college after being out for a few years and needed a program that fit my lifestyle, work, etc. The classes are small, with about 12-15 people in each one, are in the evenings, and Saturday mornings. Anyone who is in this program will tell you that it is a challenge, whether you are just starting college, or finishing the required coursework. When I went through the graduation ceremony, it was with 249 other graduates, on a sunny Saturday morning, this past Mother's day weekend. I had the biggest smile of anyone there. I had friends from work and my boyfriend of 8 years was in the bleachers, beaming, and the counselors from school were there too, to support all of our efforts. This was without a doubt one of the single best days of my life. If I were the age of the average college student, this would not be the case. Some of the kids around me could not wait to get out of there and head for the beach. I was so excited to be there, and realizing I was finally going to graduate, made me cry, too. I had spent about 20 years, off and on, going to college and now graduation was here!!! I know, at 58 years of age, ""Why College Matters"". It matters if you need to make more money; or to switch gears and have a new career; it matters if you took time off to do other things and came back to complete the achievement of a goal; it matters is you are seeking to expand your knowledge and interact with others who are doing the same thing; it matters if you have kids, so that they can see that it matters to you that they go to college, because you got your degree."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Early in my childhood, being the descendent of Puerto Rican Immigrants--from the age of 8 or 9, managing family affairs became a necessity. In the mid-1960s, my father moved from Puerto Rico to the United States to seek employment. Only months after his arrival to the States, he met an acquaintance from his small childhood town of Patillas, Puerto Rico. That acquaintance, who happened to leave Puerto Rico with the same intentions as my father, seeking opportunity in the Promise Land - was none other than now my mother. Having spoken very little English, they came to depend on me for most of their household financial affairs - including, English translations, banking, savings, bill payments and record keeping. My father having completed school to the fourth grade and my mother, according to my father, unable to handle financial affairs despite the fact she was in deed a high school graduate. Needless to say, education was not a priority in our home. Sadly, looking back on life, education - I should say college-bound education didn't seem like much a priority for any of my low to middle-income friends. Those who went on to college it seemed were the rich and well to do kids - those kids where college was expected of them. It seemed those in our neighborhood, our reality, was purely based on the working family mentality which was working - trying to pay bills and surviving. College back then, for us, was just an unattainable goal."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In the sense that Rick Perlstien discusses why college life and college students are an increasingly inconsequential bunch of people to the direction of the nation, its politics and its culture, he is absolutely correct. As a current university student, I cannot dispute his allegations and this should be nosurprise. It is important however, that we all understand the reasons for this change between the generations. I believe there are three overarching explinations for this; first, we live in an increasingly isolated society, second, college is no longer a unique experience, and third, the out of control costs of auniversity education."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I suppose I should begin by saying that I don't go to a real college. I mean, I don't feel like I go to a real college. I don't take real classes. I don't live on a real campus.

Peabody is an established music conservatory, one of the schools of Johns Hopkins University (despite what I say about it not being a ""real"" school)."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein is so yesterday. Contrary to his protestations, college life is no less important in 2007 than it was forty years ago when our parents were in school. Its role in defining my generation has simply changed as the nature of the college experience has evolved. If the world is flat, it has also turned itself inside out in the past half-century. And while today's campuses may lack the fiery, anti-establishment tone of our parents' era, their diversity both racial and economic make them evermore important as they increasingly represent the country as a whole."

He recalled his intense discussions on race relations, an issue he found himself more and more sympathetic towards. College is about redefining your point of view, he would cheerfully advise me.

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Ben Franklin once described New Jersey, sandwiched between Philadelphia and New York, as a barrel tapped at both ends. One might say the same about today's college experience. On one side, high school kids, thanks to Advanced Placement courses, ambitious extracurriculars and the Internet, have gained early access to many experiences once reserved for college students. On the other, employers and grad schools have encouraged students to pursue internships and gain ""real world"" experience far earlier than they used to. Indeed, the two ends of the barrel are now converging. As Kay S. Hymowitz recently noted in The Wall Street Journal, resume-sensitive teenagers are trading the traditional summer pursuits of moving lawns and scooping ice cream for internships or study abroad. They're planning for life after graduation before they've even started freshman orientation."

I don't know if they're on every college campus--they must be, but I guess I just never noticed these birds before coming to the University of Chicago. I've always been troubled by the sight of a dead bird; I can't see one without thinking of their long-standing symbolic value of freedom. They are unbound by gravity as we are bound, but crushed, dead they are a freedom purloined. This removal of freedom is a starting point for the transformation of the college experience from the 1960s. College cannot be what it once was; the collectivity of the college lifestyle has disintegrated to a singular experience in which it has become impossible to care outside of oneself. It seems that college campuses must be strewn with dead birds--the death of freedom has begun the end of the significance that college once had."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"A few weeks ago I attended my 17 year-old cousin's high school graduation party and tried mingling with a few of her friends about their post-high school plans. I expected them to gush over what colleges they were going to, what they wanted to study, the excitement and the fears of leaving home for the first time... or at least care. To my surprise, every question I had about their impending future was met with them same boredom infused ""I don't know, I guess I'll go to college"" response. I was really shocked and confused; maybe it was just these girls who couldn't muster up any enthusiasm for this new chapter of their lives, or maybe I was in the minority of students who couldn't wait to live out the proactive adventures I had read about in books like The Virgin of Benington or in the writings of Gloria Steinem and Erica Jong. But when I look back to two years ago when I first arrived at school, in all honesty, I am disappointed with my experience thus far. I have found that most students have the same indifferent attitude towards the unique experience of attending an institution of higher learning and it appears that this wave of apathetic entitlement is what defines the modern college culture."

He was long-winded and uninteresting, so I tuned him out for most of the time.

Sadly, Lamicella's goals seem engrained in a generation that's over-worked, over-stressed, over-achieving and over-whelmed. Lamicella is a typical member of the Over-Generation."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"We've gotten angry only once. After three years at American University, I would have expected more noise from the student body once labeled ""most politically active"" by The Princeton Review. But, excluding the riot when Red Sox beat the Yankees and occasional antic of an isolated activist, there has only been one issue important enough to unite us. That day, a quarter of the student body filled the quad during a board of trustees meeting, suited with sandwich boards and armed with picket signs. For the next few hours, a few irate leaders guided the mob through profane chants loud enough to interrupt the meeting inside."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Alas... The days of burning draft cards and stinking of patchouli are officially over forever. Aside from the nostalgic contemporary hippie, we all may be better off without the latter. Yet, the very ideas that produced these radical acts were born in the minds of young people in the strangest settings. Patches of land and historic buildings dedicated solely to the production and manipulation of all things intellectual. Imagine - a serious institution literally powered by the brain energy of teenagers and ""kids"" in their twenties. What could result in total chaos has now become a formal runway in which young adults receive an education that will launch them into their future endeavors."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"When I first started reading the article, I was sure that I had a ton of things to say about why college was deteriorating from what it used to be for youths. There are so many things I have from my experience to share, or rather to complain about. Everyone does. I can hardly conceive a college student who cannot still give plenty of grievances for their time spent at school. My biggest issue has always been money. And by money I mean my money, not my parent's money. But then, as I began to really think about everything that I've experienced, I reminded myself how there are more and more college students who are going about college way differently from how I have. And money is a very good example of that. One of the first things I learned about college I learned from an old Bill Cosby stand-up special. Mr. Cosby said, ""I tell my kids, 'Your mother and I are rich. You have NOTHING.'"" As someone who lives in Texas and attends school in Madison, Wisconsin, I can certainly identi fy with the feeling of having nothing. When I moved into my dorm freshman year, I was able to accomplish literally all of the moving by way of suitcases. I had no source of money, I had no car, and I knew a total of 3 people during the first week. I only get to visit home in the south 3 times a year, on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and part of the summer. Best of all, tuition has been an arm and a leg for me, which isn't good because I also run Track and Field. It's safe to say I'm having a unique college life."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Let's not allow 21st century fashion to inhibit our perception of college. Just because this era's raging radicals have shifted their baseball caps to the side and chosen tapered jeans or spandex (otherwise known as leggings) to substitute long bohemian skirts and bandanas decorated with peace signs doesn't mean college has lost it's life. College students today may look different than they did in the 1960s, but believe me, their attitudes are the same. We still thrive on rebellions - be it against our parents, institutions, or the rest of the world. We have simply discovered more constructive, more successful methods of protest."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The modern college student idolizes the campus of the 60?s and 70?s. Parents speak of their storied pasts with fire in their throats. They talk about a time of dangerous and wonderful change. A brighter future seemed possible and they were leading the way. Today, our movies, music and fashion struggle to emulate it. Throngs of students, from every walk of life, going to the same schools, taking the same drugs, and wearing the same psychedelic floral patterns, sit on windswept grassy fields and lament an era gone by before their time. Why do we look back with this glassy-eyed longing? Is it because we, the new generation of college students, America?s brightest stars, have failed to carry on the torch? Have we failed to inspire change the way our parents did? Maybe."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein's article ""What's the Matter With College"" posits that today's college is a banal experience in which student life no longer seems important, as compared the college life in the 1960s, in which the university was a forum for political dissent and the foundation of all personal growth. His inspirations are former students from the 60s, whose effusive commentary about the ""boundless verve"" of their decade stand in alarming contrast to his interviewees, current college students who are either consumed by today's social ennui or are blissfully ignorant of it. His assessment is, on the surface, fair enough. We are no longer under direct attack by the political majority as a threat to the establishment. I cannot recall a single evening spent discussing subversive reading materials or planning a ""sit in"" in the administration building. But in my experience, the assertion that the college world has lost its edge, its soul, and its importance could not be farther from the truth."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"While more students go to college than ever before, they paradoxically seem to attract less attention than before, as Rick Perlstein observed in his essay ""What's the Matter with College"". The unique social and academic privileges of college are no longer restricted to college. Due to the growth of the Internet, students no longer need college to ""make connections"" with others of similar social and academic interests. Most importantly, students no longer need college to seek an education, for that education can come off the Internet."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Perlstein describes me perfectly in his essay, ""What's the Matter with College?"". The name on my planner might as well read ""Organization Kid"", given that, when I wanted to have a party last semester, my friends and I had to spend a week emailing each other to find an hour time slot that worked for everyone. I spent my high school years studying for the SAT (and the ACT, so that I could take both tests and use my highest score for my college applications). And I talk to my parents on the phone for 15 minutes every day, at the bare minimum."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Watching The Big Chill always makes me a little sad. The first time I saw the movie I was in high school, fed up with superficiality and rules; not surprisingly, I was in awe of the characters in the movie who reminisced about their radical days in college in the late 1960s. They refer to themselves wryly as ""revolutionaries"" and recall the speeches they made that ignited action in hundreds of students, as equally disillusioned with the world as they were. I couldn't wait to go to college and be part of this energy of protest and change."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"As a journalism student, we learn always to ask ourselves ""who cares?"" when writing a story. Having read three times Rick Perlstein's ""What's the Matter with College?"" I find myself asking that very question. In more than twice the space I have here, he bemoans how college - or his idea of college - has devolved since his days as a rebellious hipster."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"News Flash! It's not the sixties anymore. Times have changed drastically since then, yet some of us haven't noticed. Some would be happy to treat the 2000's as the sixties, our issues as their issues, and to criticize anyone with the audacity to think of the new millennium as a new era. Rick Perlstein would be one of those people. In Perlstein's essay ""What's the Matter with College"", Perlstein argues that because college today is different than it was in his time, it is ""coming to an end"". His argument, in fact, very much resembles the ""back in my day..."" story familiar to any young person with nostalgic relatives in both its structure and, unfortunately, its irrelevance. It's true, that college has changed. It is not true that it is coming to an end. College has changed to match the times because it is no longer the sixties."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Colleges and universities have exponentially exploded in American society. Their primary purpose: to provide traditional higher education. Current economical trends, however, have given colleges and universities an additional prospect: to supply a, highly skilled, large workforce that will replace retiring baby boomers, the most educated individuals in American history. Besides satisfying these national standards, we also have global considerations to worry about. Contemporary American and international culture has become increasingly demanding and complicated for several reasons. Most of which involve technological advances, expansion of markets, and the increasing efficiency of communication. If we want to survive adequately college education not a choice it is a necessity. Success individually, as well as nationally, goes hand in hand with higher education. The college experience gears individuals to become responsible, well educated, citizens in the American democracy."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"There has, as Mr. Perslstein points out, a shift in the direction that colleges portray themselves, educate students, and are revered by people in general. This shift is reflected in the media, and most assuredly in the students both attending and graduating from college. The shift from college being a deciding factor in a national debate for a high elected office to a gigantic company promoting its favorite trades as being highly sought after for financial gain can come from many places. It is after all natural for changes to occur over time to all things. A college, like a city, like an organism, will over time adapt to surrounding atmospheres."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,Why College Matters
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein is right. College as America used to understand it is coming to an end, but for a different reason. Perlstein's article ""What's the Matter with College"" describes this issue, but it fails to look at the underlying cause. From my opinion as a current college student, I blame technology. Iphones, ipods, and social sites like Facebook and Youtube are destroying the sense of community on the college campus. I know, because I've watched students' infatuation with these devices lead them to choose the company of their computer screens and earplugs over that of the physical eyes and ears of their friends. How are students to be activists when technology prevents them from being a student body?"
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"It's common knowledge to Americans that kindergarten is followed by grade school and then grade school is followed by high school. College used to be regarded as a privilege for those who can afford it until recently it has started to be regarded and expected of students to go to college right after high school. Before students go to college and discover it for themselves, they have grandiose ideas conjured in their minds of classes, meeting new people and liberty formerly unknown to them, but what these students don't realize at first is why they are going to college. Some students may just be at college because they are doing what they are told or going because they want to get into graduate school. But the unwritten result of going to college and why college matters is because it transforms them from children into adults and throughout the whole transformation process the students will have learned more about themselves more than ever before."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"My mind clouds as I try to imagine what I thought of college, of my future life before I left home. I wasn't completely taken with the whole college idea. I didn't believe in it all that much. All those college campuses, these separate worlds nestled in some old town with their pillars and hills, old football fields of green and white with rivers shining beneath pines. There had to be a catch."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"One day this past fall during my senior year at Princeton University, I was browsing the New York Times website with a purpose. Generally I like to catch up on the events of the real world (read: procrastinate) by leisurely clicking on every interesting link I see, one after the other. I start with the headline articles that rotate every couple of hours or so, then move down to the ""most popular e-mailed articles"" before working my way through the ""World,"" ""US"" and ""Fashion and Style"" sections. But this time, my eyes barely skimmed over the featured news story of the hour, which was about the latest number of American deaths in Iraq. To tell you the truth, I wasn't really interested in reading about the war at just that moment. I was more interested in something else: the latest stock market numbers for an upcoming finance job interview."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In Rick Perlstein's essay, ""What's the Matter With College,"" he states that ""college campuses seem to have lost their centrality."" Yet in the golden yesteryear of which he writes, the '60s-- disregarding the voices on campus meant ignoring the masses. Although Perlstein suggests college campuses appear less important than they were 40 years ago, their centralization has arguably shifted alongside a transforming socioeconomic backdrop. Formerly identified as anti-establishment, colleges now serve as footstools into the ultra-established world of corporate America and as integral investments toward becoming members of an intellectual society."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"On Monday, May 4th, 1970 a group of about 2,000 students at Kent State University gathered at Commons area to protest in response to the invasion of Cambodia, as had been announced four days earlier on national television by President Nixon. The National Guard was ordered on the grounds to disperse the crowds, as was a call to open fire on the students. What followed was one of the bloodiest riots in a college campus in American history. There were four casualties, and nine wounded students. America was shocked."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"It has been correctly observed that conflict between established authority and students on college campuses has precipitously dropped, particularly in comparison to the 1960's and 70's. This has led some to question whether college is as integral to the nation as it once was. I want to take this opportunity to ask these people a question: When has conflict ever been conducive to the construction and advancement of a society?"

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"On its surface, Rick Perlstein's thesis that today's college experience is an ennui-filled wasteland seems frighteningly astute. One need not enter a Kaplan Center to find a generation primed to stay within the standardized test's proverbial Scantron bubble, solving for X but not solving any problems. Stepford-esque pre-professional fervor burns rampant in the hearts of today's co-eds as bachelor's degrees become less valuable than the paper they are printed on. Even conservative pundit Michelle Malkin was on to something when she deemed the politically-correct university establishment as a ""coddle industry"" designed to stifle rather than engage intellectual discourse. In this decade of slack-jawed complacency, where even Malkin is a voice of reason about the institution, the fate of college as we know it looks grim. College is dead."

I defy anyone with a degree to say Mr. Buffett was wrong.

Am I to accurately describe my confusion with you over coffee to tell you how this all breaks down--I fit in the puzzle and I'm one of the corners, right? Politics.

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In What's the Matter with College? Rick Perlstien states that the famed college experience as we know it is extinct. He implies that college campuses are wastelands devoid of creative thought and original thinking. They exist just out of legacy and serve as a stepping stone from high school into the job market. This statement is ill informed. Students and their respective universities need not reevaluate their current standing. The learning experience is still there, but students have to go about finding it in a different way. In the advent of modern technology, most young individuals know much more about themselves then their parents or grandparents did at the same age. Going about finding the right place to help you further your life goals is harder than it once was, but easier too."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"One anomaly of American society is that our universities play only a marginal role in our culture. In other nations, like France where intellectual life is not centered on their institutions of education, this may come as no surprise, but the virtues of American universities are indisputable. Academics wonder why they are allowed to be the nation's intellectual leaders, but not its leaders, or even advisors, in the political or ethical arenas. Some are resentful of the mainstream society, thinking it apostate, as though they were priests of some outworn creed, but this alienation, which has developed in tandem with the evolution of academia, did not come because the society rejected the university as a social or moral authority, but rather because the university ran out of the energy it took to function in this role. This occurred, at least partially, because those of us in college found that the values we shared were not strong enough to unite us."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"In order to ask ""What's the Matter with College?"" as Mr. Perlstein does in his essay, one must acknowledge that there is indeed a problem. But is there actually something ""wrong"" with college as it exists today? I personally cannot answer that question, but I can say that college, and the role it plays in the lives of undergraduates and society at large, has indeed changed from what it once was. Hyper-competitiveness has become an omnipresent force that affects not only undergraduates, but also high school students, graduate students, and professionals. In his essay, Mr. Perlstein provides a glimpse into what many students throughout the country encounter in college today. The intense atmosphere has brought the college experience as it once was known to an end. The opportunity for freedom and self-discovery that was fostered by that experience has disappeared. Childhood, and the freedom to express one's self without serious consequence, essentially comes to an end in the 8th grade."

Next to them is a brilliantly red photograph of unidentifiable gore labeled ""Planned Parenthood."" As if the visual implication were not enough, those manning the billboards are shouting their message: They are the Genocide Awareness Project, and they are on my campus telling me, yelling in my face as I pass by, that abortion is genocide. My t-shirt reads the definition of the word ""genocide"" on the front and ""Abortion ? Genocide"" on the back, and I point to it as I silently joint the ranks of those protesting the demonstration."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Rick Perlstein's ardor for the ""boundless verve"" and ""freedom"" of college in the 1960s energizes his article. Actually, Perlstein's revelations of unrestrained vigor exposed the post-midnight fantasies that my roommate and I would fashion within our naïve, playful college minds. ""If you could live in any 20th century decade, which one would it be?"" I'd ask. ""Oh the '60s!"" Aimee would sigh, as though spellbound by romance. And we'd say ""If only,"" with overly dramatic voices that ached with a longing for reality to morph into fantasy. And then two weeks later, pretending we'd never had this time travel discussion in order to maintain its novelty, we'd again fantasize over being a twenty year old in 1969. We were like some small, somewhat pathetic illustration of Perlstein's frustration over how college today lacks the spontaneous vigor of college back then. Perlstein's conviction must have merit if two college women, both raised at all girls' high schools to appreciate their modern opportunities as victories of a feminist movement, yearn to be flower girls. Well, we'd be educated flower girls, we thought. We wanted to be the irrepressibly passionate Ali MacGraw in Love Story. Desire so often springs from deprivation. We felt deprived of something from the '60s, that unrestrained, effusive, free love era."

With the party rumbling below my feet, I looked over a to-do list that his mom had left for him. I pictured my friend playing with the dogs, taking the garbage out.

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The sixties' college experience was my generation's favorite bedtime story. But like all the best tales we tell ourselves, this one too went the way of the tooth fairy. In his What's the Matter with College, Rick Perlstein examines the modern phenomenon of the College Campus that Couldn't, wondering how it devolved from its sixties counterpart, a magical realm that kindled its students' intellectual fires and replaced all the world's answers with questions. Today, he reports, college life is a choice between organization and alienation. College without criticism falls short of being critical; and when campus no longer leads the culture, college as we know it is coming to an end. But if college was college before Perlstein was there, collegians once learned not to question society's values but to uphold them. Whether it translates to a hippie's dream or a hipster's nightmare, college is still society, caricatured: the sixties were a liberating time for everyone involved, not just the freshmen, and if college then inculcated an era-appropriate dose of dissent, college these days does just as good a job raising respect for the establishment. It's the very stillness of true conservatism that allows its impact to slide by unnoticed, and so while Perlstein is right to note today's collegiate sea change, I don't see the level of questioning he hearkens to occurring anywhere, whether on campus or off. No wonder the celebration of universities has quieted since the hippies' heyday; today's political climate holds its dissidents and intellectuals at bay. So though the tides have changed, campus and culture are still linked and college is as decisive an expe rience when society pushes back."

The importance of college was stressed in families because this was where they learned new and exciting things. Things that they would have never encountered by just staying at home; however, now, there are not many things that students could not discover at home."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The other Monday I was at my friend Scott's house. His parents had left for the night, so he threw a party in his basement. Unfortunately, a number of high schoolers had shown up. I went upstairs to get some air and sat down at his kitchen table with a glass of water. With the party rumbling below my feet, I looked over a to-do list that his mom had left for him. I pictured my friend playing with the dogs, taking the garbage out. Scott's a tall and funny looking fellow, who does about a hundred pushups every day. He is determined to have a good time in about any place he goes."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The sixties' college experience was my generation's favorite bedtime story. But like all the best tales we tell ourselves, this one too went the way of the tooth fairy. In his What's the Matter with College, Rick Perlstein examines the modern phenomenon of the College Campus that Couldn't, wondering how it devolved from its sixties counterpart, a magical realm that kindled its students' intellectual fires and replaced all the world's answers with questions. Today, he reports, college life is a choice between organization and alienation. College without criticism falls short of being critical; and when campus no longer leads the culture, college as we know it is coming to an end. But if college was college before Perlstein was there, collegians once learned not to question society's values but to uphold them. Whether it translates to a hippie's dream or a hipster's nightmare, college is still society, caricatured: the sixties were a liberating time for everyone involved, not just the freshmen, and if college then inculcated an era-appropriate dose of dissent, college these days does just as good a job raising respect for the establishment. It's the very stillness of true conservatism that allows its impact to slide by unnoticed, and so while Perlstein is right to note today's collegiate sea change, I don't see the level of questioning he hearkens to occurring anywhere, whether on campus or off. No wonder the celebration of universities has quieted since the hippies' heyday; today's political climate holds its dissidents and intellectuals at bay. So though the tides have changed, campus and culture are still linked and college is as decisive an expe rience when society pushes back."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"I am sitting here in my room in the West African city of Bissau, sipping red wine and trying to articulate what university has meant to me. I could try to extrapolate my experience to the entire American college phenomenon, but, to paraphrase Joan Didion, I am not the college experience in a microcosm and to pretend otherwise would be false and presumptuous. But it would be equally invalid to believe myself to be unique simply because I am fortunate enough to attend a small, prestigious university. I am merely one in a sea of many, and learning this fact has perhaps been the most valuable lesson that college has afforded me."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The sun shone brightly on an unusually warm January day as tens of thousands of people circled around the Washington monument, chanting slogans, listening to celebrity speeches and waving colorful banners and signs. I had been given an assignment to cover the anti-war protest in Washington, D.C. for my university?s newspaper, and after a six hour bus ride my roommates Claire, Amy and I, raised in London, Long Island and Oklahoma respectively, were in the thick of our first real protest."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Jimmy Buffett summed up the college experience in perhaps the simplest and most accurate of ways I've ever heard in his song, ""Pencil Thin Mustache,"" singing these words: ""They send you off to college, try to gain a lot of knowledge, but all you want to do is learn how to score."" I defy anyone with a degree to say Mr. Buffett was wrong. Thirty years later, not much has changed, but this is arguable in the eyes of some parents, who can't help but worry about the direction higher education seems to have taken."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"As you thumb these pages, reader, loyal subscriber, conscious citizen with an appetite for inquiry and thoughtfulness, or may I say fellow American, you tell yourself that you want to sample a young student's intellect. Certainly I do believe that my own college experience has been important, even critical, to my life and to my thoughts here and now, but young and impressionable does not necessarily partner with a tame, meaningful sense of hindsight... My college experience has fostered some growth. But for the nation? Lend me some relevance. Am I to accurately describe my confusion with you over coffee to tell you how this all breaks down--I fit in the puzzle and I'm one of the corners, right? Politics. We don't have movements, and we don't have causes. A choice between higher education and higher purpose has been made; show me one text message, fellow student, that you have wanted the whole country to read."

2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"To Mr. Perlstein, a graduate of my own University of Chicago, I must say this: give me a break. I was certainly one of his alienated kids in high school. My politics, like his, are left of center. Yet his article repelled me. He speaks of his ""radical, alienated friends,"" the unhappier subjects of his interviews, as if the mere fact that they are not ""organization kids"" makes them the right kind of college student. Speaking of interviewing a happy student, he remarks, ""I ask her if many of her fellow students, as many young people did in the 1960's, feel alienated from society."" He is disappointed when she answers in the negative. It seems that he would like to have the rest of us engage in hating our institutions and society at large because it is better to be alienated, because that is what going to college is all about and because being alienated is the prerequisite for making change."
2007-09-24T00:00:00Z,"For just a bit over fifty times what my father paid for tuition a few decades ago, I can attend the small liberal arts college of my choice. This is not my father's college. Whether students are fiscally chained to the arm of a parent or that of their loan officer, they are implicitly taught that college can provide you with the key to unlocking your shackles of dependency (the key being a high paying white collar job with 401k and full benefits, whatever that means). Just a stepping stone, to get the sheepskin; college is, what college gives."

A theater professional who appeared in a number of featured and starring roles in television, stage and film in the 1950s and 1960s, she was born in Phoenix, Arizona, the daughter of Frank Cullen Brophy and Sallie Blake. She graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London in 1950, and her arrival in New York coincided with the ''golden age'' of American television. She worked with actors ranging from Jack Lemmon to Cliff Robertson, and directors from Sidney Lumet to Arthur Penn. Among the many segments she did were those on The U S Steel Hour, The Dick Powell Show, Kraft Theater, the Alcoa Hour, Ben Casey, Medic, and the Fugitive. In the Producers Theater version of ''Peter Pan'', she played Wendy, grown up, and twice played the Hepburn role in ''The Philadelphia Story''. In 1958 she starred in her own series, a Western set in the Montana Territory, ''Buckskin''. She had a featured role in the 1961 film, ''The Children's Hour'', with Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine, which won 5 Academy Awards. She married George (Jerry) Goodman in 1961, and when the couple moved to Princeton in 1965, she directed student productions at the Murray Dodge Theater at Princeton University. She taught theater and acting for 20 years at Rider University in Lawrenceville, NJ. Her husband became known as the financial writer and television host, ''Adam Smith'', and his experience in preparing for his long running PBS series, ''Adam Smith's Money World'', led her to a new career in coaching individuals and corporations, and she set up a firm, Public Presentations. She counted several senators among her clients, but most notably, architecture firms, who would bring their slides and talks to her for a dress rehearsal before the presentation of a major bid. She was noted for her lively wit, her intuition, and her ability to gather people to her home. Her studies in Buddhist meditation led her to five years of volunteer work with The Princeton Hospice Group. She is survived by husband of 46 years, Jerry Goodman, two children, Mark, of Newton, MA, and Susannah, of Washington, DC, and two grandchildren, Sophie and Lily.

On completing law school in 1941 at what was then National University, which later became part of George Washington University, Carliner enlisted in the Army and completed Officer Candidate School but was denied a commission because of his political views.

Despite the $17.6 million investment in the line’s “customer information system,” the results were only slightly better than the D-plus grade that riders recently gave the public address system on the No. 7 line. The No. 7 train, however, which runs from Flushing, Queens, to Times Square, has not had a similar upgrade to its public address system.

2007-09-28T00:00:00Z,"'THE EMOTIONAL CAMERA: MIKHAIL KALATOZOV' A young man and woman skip hand in hand along the bank of a sparkling river, moving farther and farther from the camera, which floats gently up to watch them from on high. That's the opening shot of Mikhail Kalatozov's ''Cranes Are Flying'' (1957), a lovely image of freedom that seems to announce: The thaw is on. Just four years after Stalin's death (and a year after he was denounced by Khrushchev), the Soviet cinema was experiencing its own new wave, and ''The Cranes Are Flying,'' which opens BAMcinématek's Kalatozov series with a weeklong run starting on Wednesday, is one of the period's undisputed masterpieces. (It won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1958.) Part of what made ''Cranes'' radical was its focus on individual lives: The film is romantic, even Hollywoodish at times. Its opening takes place the day the Soviet Union enters World War II, and soon the young man, Boris (Alexei Batalov), volunteers for the front, leaving behind Veronica (Tatiana Samoilova, above, a movie star if there ever was one). Also radical is that the film dares to show corruption in the bureaucracy, to mock certain Soviet protocols gently and to conclude with an antimilitarist message: ''We will do everything to ensure that sweethearts are never again parted by war,'' a returning hero says in a speech."

All of these and more are on view on canvas and car hoods in a new retrospective at the Guggenheim. ''Paradoxically beautiful,'' writes Roberta Smith, ''his work takes aim, startles, amuses and then splinters in the mind. It disturbs assumptions about art, originality and value, class and sexual difference and creativity.'' Also money and time, if you see it tonight: the museum is open late and is pay-what-you-wish.

2007-09-28T00:00:00Z,"'WILLIAM HENRY FOX TALBOT: SELECTIONS FROM A PRIVATE COLLECTION' A distinguished private European collection is the source of this ever so lovely exhibition devoted to William Henry Fox Talbot, the 19th-century English gentleman-scientist, author of numerous mathematical and scientific papers, and inventor of the negative-positive photographic process, the basis of most photography before the digital era. He was also a pretty good photographer in his own right, producing a remarkable number and variety of photographs, from landscape and architecture studies to early panoramic city and street scenes and reproductions of artwork. Not surprisingly, he is widely regarded as the first accomplished artist-photographer. All of the photographs in this exhibition are original prints, and most are in excellent condition, given their age and the delicacy of the materials. Talbot printed his photographs on good-quality writing paper, coated with silver salts. Then he hung the prints outside on racks and let the sun do the rest. Among the works on display are aerial views of the boulevards of Paris, and a quiet street scene in York: a confident composition showing a cathedral neatly framed by urban buildings. But equally arresting, if less known, are a series of closely observed photographs of cut and faceted glass and china arranged rhythmically on shelves. Obscured in reflections of light within these articles are tiny, distorted images of Talbot himself, staring back out at us across time. (Above, ''The Open Door,'' an 1844 salt print by Talbot.)

Tomorrow, many of these groups will band together to present the FAB! Festival, featuring five hours of live events on several outdoor stages, and a few indoor ones as well. La MaMa will take to the street with a schedule of offerings including excerpts from Collaboration Town's ''Townville,'' opening on Oct. 6 at the theater, and an appearance by Kendall Cornell's Soon-to-Be-World-Famous Women's Clown Troupe.

2007-09-28T00:00:00Z,"COMPAGNIE KÄFIG: 'WASTELAND' Hip-hop dance might have been born on the streets of New York, but it has achieved another kind of legitimacy in France, where in the early 1990s a generation of dancers and choreographers, backed by forward-thinking directors of theaters and festivals, began to give it potent theatrical form. In the United States, hip-hop has a strong association with black Americans; in France it's closely linked to French-speaking North African immigrants, who have brought fresh influences to the music and movement. One of the best of the many troupes to emerge in France over the last decade or so is Compagnie Käfig, appearing this weekend as part of the French Institute Alliance Française's ''Crossing the Line'' festival. Founded by Mourad Merzouki in 1996, the company is a brilliant exemplar of the way the rough energy and gravity-defying virtuosity of street dance can be transformed into abstract poems about form and space.

One of a kind, she lived many years in Greenwich Village, NY and was very active on the board of her Homeowners Association. She was an avid sports fan whose interest had been initiated via her grandfather Colonel Rupert Huston who owned the NY Yankees, built Yankee Stadium and brought Babe Ruth to the Yankees. In her younger years she was a good swimmer, tennis player and skier. Bridge was also an important part of her life. She was a constant student of politics, history, and anything that was happening in the world. Her feistiness, irreverent sense of humor, and clever repartee made her a great addition to all occasions, large or small. She knew the art of conversation from the old days. When she first became acquainted with her husband Armando in 1944, he said she was one of the most beautiful ladies he had ever met. But to reflect on her actual charm, she was a superbly excellent dancer particularly when dancing the Argentine tango ''Arraballero'' in which she excelled quite spectacularly; swinging and swaying delightfully holding tight to her partners hand responding to its direction, creating a spectacle elegant and grand that invariably called everybody's attention without any fear of anyone's intervention, as the audience usually arose and applauded.

2007-09-29T00:00:00Z,"LEDBETTER--William Joe Born in Memphis, Tennessee on January 24, 1927, passed away at his home in Montecito, California. He went peacefully in his sleep September 21, 2007 after several months of challenged health. His daughter was with him. Family and friends were nearby. He was the son of Andrew and Jessie Ledbetter. After serving in the Naval Reserve during World War II, William attended the University of Memphis, the University of Nebraska, and received his law degree at Washington & Lee University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and the Order of the Coif. Following graduation, he practiced law as an associate of Cravath, Swaine & Moore in New York City until he was hired by General Electric Company where he reached the position of Associate Corporate Attorney. From there he moved to Honeywell Inc. where he served as General Counsel. So much of his legal work involved raising money to support the company's venture into the computer business that in the early seventies he changed his emphasis from law to finance and was subsequently employed by Addressograph - Multi graph first as Vice PresidentFinance and then as Vice President of International Operations with subsidiaries in 23 and dealers in 110 countries. In 1978, William became Vice President-Finance of Textron Inc., a pioneer conglomerate with divisions involved in more than thirty unrelated businesses. There he became involved in almost all aspects of the Company's business, especially the purchase and sale of discrete business units. He retired from Textron in 1989 as Senior Executive Vice President. In addition to his business activities William was involved in many charitable and civic activities such as Vice Chairman of the Board of Roger Williams Hospital, Member of the Rhode Island Board of Accountancy, Member of Board of Rhode Island Mental Health Association, Vice President of V. P. Finance Association of Cleveland, President of Minnesota Corporate Counsel Association, and many fund raising activities for United Way, Red Cross and similar organizations. In 1956, William met and married Shirley Ann Good of Santa Paula, California. As a result of changes in his career the couple lived in several locations including New York City, Minneapolis, Cleveland and Providence, and, thus, developed a wide circle of friends across the country. Upon retirement, they moved to Shirley's birthplace, a lemon ranch in Santa Paula, where they lived until Shirley died in an auto accident in 2005. William is survived by a son, Gleghn Andrew Ledbetter of Cornville, AZ and a daughter, Sally Ann Ledbetter of Westport, MA. Because William's friends are so scattered across the country, there will not be any single memorial service and those who wish to do so are requested to remember him and celebrate his life in their private way. Gifts in remembrance of him are requested to be made to the Museum of Ventura County or the GoodLedbetter Scholarship Fund at the School of Law at Washington & Lee University."

2007-09-29T00:00:00Z,"SAUL--Stephen Henry , Ph.D. Scholar, Teacher, Humanist, died peacefully at home in Honolulu of AUL on August 29, 2007. He was recently retired as Associate Entomologist/Professor with special expertise in genetics from PEPS (Department of Plant and Environmental Protection Services) in the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. Born in Brooklyn in 1941, Stephen was a graduate of Stuyvesant High School as a National Merit Finalist with achievement awards in Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics; Brooklyn College; and the University of Rochester. He was awarded New York State Regents Scholarships for College and for the study of Medicine. He was a member and living example of the ideals of Alpha Phi Omega, the national service fraternity, and Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society. Prior to moving to Honolulu, he was a Ford Foundation Fellow in Population Biology at the University of Chicago, and Visiting Assistant Professor and Post-Doctoral Researcher in the Vector Biology Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame. Stephen read extensively in cosmology and had deep respect and reverence for the nature of both the physical and biological world. As a biologist he fully understood the natural cycle of life, including the role of death in perpetuating the cycle. His message to family and friends is that he was fortunate to have had a very good life; he was grateful for being able to experience so much that was professionally and personally rewarding. For him, everyone mattered and every being was important. His keen intellect and inherent idealism propelled him to pursue a life of continuous learning on a wide range of subjects outside of science including history, literature, philosophy and the arts; he was always ready to share the resulting knowledge and understanding, doing so most often with disarming wit and humor. He found the engaging response of his students most gratifying. Stephen served as President of the Pacific Orchid Society of Hawai'i, and led discussions with other devotees of classical music as the FEMLS; he particularly treasured the friendships forged through such shared interests. A kind, appreciative and loving person, Stephen gave freely of himself. He will be deeply missed and remembered by many as a bright light in their lives. The insights and sensibilities for which Stephen was so admired, were considered by him a continual gift since his early years to the present from the family he loved: grandparents David (deceased) and Irene Saul (deceased); parents Jerome (deceased) and Lottie Saul; aunts and uncles Gertrude (deceased) and Sydney Peimer, Bernard (deceased) and Helene (deceased) Saul, Marian and David (deceased) Lubin, and Robert (deceased) and Elaine Saul. He is survived also by wife Alice Saul of Honolulu, HI; brothers David N. Saul and wife Susan of Wayland, MA and Arthur D. Saul and wife Mary Ann of Dix Hills, NY.

2007-09-30T00:00:00Z,"Gary Taubes (Sept. 16) urges caution in accepting premature epidemiologic results. We agree: scientists are generally skeptics. As cautious pragmatists, our work has improved life expectancy and quality. Epidemiology demonstrated the hazards of smoking, the benefits of lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, that infant sleeping position reduces SIDS, sun exposure causes melanoma and folate supplementation helps prevent birth defects. Some were “bolts from the blue,” and since no one knows what bolts remain undetected, we keep looking. Uncertainty along the way is the hallmark of science and the price of progress. Premature media pronouncements erode public trust. Good epidemiologists eschew these. Clinical trials, also in our toolbox, are useful but no panacea because we cannot randomly expose people to risks and because participants are self-selected and often unrepresentative. Granted, epidemiology is time consuming, expensive and requires public will. But don’t lose the forest for the trees: epidemiology has hugely improved health."

Conversely, although some observational studies are done poorly, well-designed nonrandomized research often withstands the test of time. The take-home message for readers should be not to expect certainty from any individual study, observational or randomized. Progress in science is iterative and incremental -- in the long run, we get closer to ''truth'' as overall evidence accumulates on a given topic. Putting what we know into practice would prevent more disease than worshiping at the altar of randomized trials. John Concato, M.D."

They are a far cry from the simple accommodations we had when, as a young boy, I lived with my parents at the edge of the Amazon jungle in Ecuador. But, as Larry Rohter mentions, ''luxury, of course, is a relative concept.''

2007-09-30T00:00:00Z,"I never expected to gain any new insight into the nature of my generation, or the changing landscape of American colleges, in lit theory. Lit theory is supposed to be the class where you sit at the back of the room with every other jaded sophomore wearing skinny jeans, thick-framed glasses, an ironic T-shirt and oversize retro headphones, just waiting for the lecture to be over so you can light up a Turkish Gold and walk to lunch while listening to Wilco. That's pretty much the way I spent the course, too; through structuralism, formalism, gender theory and postcolonialism, I was far too busy shuffling through my iPod to see what the patriarchal world order of capitalist oppression had to do with ''Ethan Frome.'' But when we began to study postmodernism, something struck a chord with me and made me sit up and look anew at the seemingly blasé college-age literati of which I was so self-consciously one. According to my textbook, the problem with defining postmodernism is that it's impossible to. The difficulty is that it is so . . . post. It defines itself so negatively against what came before it -- naturalism, romanticism and the wild revolution of modernism -- that it's sometimes hard to see what it actually is. It denies that anything can be explained neatly or even at all. It is parodic, detached, strange and sometimes menacing to traditionalists who do not understand it. Although it arose in the postwar West, the generation that has witnessed its rise has yet to come up with an explanation of what postmodern attitudes mean for the future of culture or society. The subject intrigued me because, in a class otherwise consumed by dead-letter theories, postmodernism remained an open book, tempting to the young and curious. But it also intrigued me because the question of what postmodernism -- what a movement so posteverything, so reticent to define itself -- is spoke to a larger question about the political and popular culture of today, of the other jaded sophomores sitting around me who grew up in a postmodern world."

He was recently retired as Associate Entomologist/Professor with special expertise in genetics from PEPS (Department of Plant and Environmental Protection Services) in the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. Born in Brooklyn in 1941, Stephen was a graduate of Stuyvesant High School as a National Merit Finalist with achievement awards in Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics; Brooklyn College; and the University of Rochester. He was awarded New York State Regents Scholarships for College and for the study of Medicine. He was a member and living example of the ideals of Alpha Phi Omega, the national service fraternity, and Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society. Prior to moving to Honolulu, he was a Ford Foundation Fellow in Population Biology at the University of Chicago, and Visiting Assistant Professor and Post-Doctoral Researcher in the Vector Biology Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame. Stephen read extensively in cosmology and had deep respect and reverence for the nature of both the physical and biological world. As a biologist he fully understood the natural cycle of life, including the role of death in perpetuating the cycle. His message to family and friends is that he was fortunate to have had a very good life; he was grateful for being able to experience so much that was professionally and personally rewarding. For him, everyone mattered and every being was important. His keen intellect and inherent idealism propelled him to pursue a life of continuous learning on a wide range of subjects outside of science including history, literature, philosophy and the arts; he was always ready to share the resulting knowledge and understanding, doing so most often with disarming wit and humor. He found the engaging response of his students most gratifying. Stephen served as President of the Pacific Orchid Society of Hawai'i, and led discussions with other devotees of classical music as the FEMLS; he particularly treasured the friendships forged through such shared interests. A kind, appreciative and loving person, Stephen gave freely of himself. He will be deeply missed and remembered by many as a bright light in their lives. The insights and sensibilities for which Stephen was so admired, were considered by him a continual gift since his early years to the present from the family he loved: grandparents David (deceased) and Irene Saul (deceased); parents Jerome (deceased) and Lottie Saul; aunts and uncles Gertrude (deceased) and Sydney Peimer, Bernard (deceased) and Helene (deceased) Saul, Marian and David (deceased) Lubin, and Robert (deceased) and Elaine Saul. He is survived also by wife Alice Saul of Honolulu, HI; brothers David N. Saul and wife Susan of Wayland, MA and Arthur D. Saul and wife Mary Ann of Dix Hills, NY.

2007-09-30T00:00:00Z,"LEDBETTER--William Joe Born in Memphis, Tennessee on January 24, 1927, passed away at his home in Montecito, California. He went peacefully in his sleep September 21, 2007 after several months of challenged health. His daughter was with him. Family and friends were nearby. He was the son of Andrew and Jessie Ledbetter. After serving in the Naval Reserve during World War II, William attended the University of Memphis, the University of Nebraska, and received his law degree at Washington & Lee University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and the Order of the Coif. Following graduation, he practiced law as an associate of Cravath, Swaine & Moore in New York City until he was hired by General Electric Company where he reached the position of Associate Corporate Attorney. From there he moved to Honeywell Inc. where he served as General Counsel. So much of his legal work involved raising money to support the company's venture into the computer business that in the early seventies he changed his emphasis from law to finance and was subsequently employed by Addressograph - Multi graph first as Vice PresidentFinance and then as Vice President of International Operations with subsidiaries in 23 and dealers in 110 countries. In 1978, William became Vice President-Finance of Textron Inc., a pioneer conglomerate with divisions involved in more than thirty unrelated businesses. There he became involved in almost all aspects of the Company's business, especially the purchase and sale of discrete business units. He retired from Textron in 1989 as Senior Executive Vice President. In addition to his business activities William was involved in many charitable and civic activities such as Vice Chairman of the Board of Roger Williams Hospital, Member of the Rhode Island Board of Accountancy, Member of Board of Rhode Island Mental Health Association, Vice President of V. P. Finance Association of Cleveland, President of Minnesota Corporate Counsel Association, and many fund raising activities for United Way, Red Cross and similar organizations. In 1956, William met and married Shirley Ann Good of Santa Paula, California. As a result of changes in his career the couple lived in several locations including New York City, Minneapolis, Cleveland and Providence, and, thus, developed a wide circle of friends across the country. Upon retirement, they moved to Shirley's birthplace, a lemon ranch in Santa Paula, where they lived until Shirley died in an auto accident in 2005. William is survived by a son, Gleghn Andrew Ledbetter of Cornville, AZ and a daughter, Sally Ann Ledbetter of Westport, MA. Because William's friends are so scattered across the country, there will not be any single memorial service and those who wish to do so are requested to remember him and celebrate his life in their private way.

She leaves her former husband Armando Rene Grave de Peralta of New York City and La Jolla, California, and two stepsons Frederic de Peralta of New York City and William Adams de Peralta of Oceanside, CA. One of a kind, she lived many years in Greenwich Village, NY and was very active on the board of her Homeowners Association. She was an avid sports fan whose interest had been initiated via her grandfather Colonel Rupert Huston who owned the NY Yankees, built Yankee Stadium and brought Babe Ruth to the Yankees. In her younger years she was a good swimmer, tennis player and skier. Bridge was also an important part of her life. She was a constant student of politics, history, and anything that was happening in the world. Her feistiness, irreverent sense of humor, and clever repartee made her a great addition to all occasions, large or small. She knew the art of conversation from the old days. When she first became acquainted with her husband Armando in 1944, he said she was one of the most beautiful ladies he had ever met. But to reflect on her actual charm, she was a superbly excellent dancer particularly when dancing the Argentine tango ''Arraballero'' in which she excelled quite spectacularly; swinging and swaying delightfully holding tight to her partners hand responding to its direction, creating a spectacle elegant and grand that invariably called everybody's attention without any fear of anyone's intervention, as the audience usually arose and applauded. A Celebration of her Life will be held on Thursday November 8, 2007 at 2:30pm at Greenwood Memorial Park & Mortuary, 4300 Imperial Ave., San Diego, CA 92113. The service will be held at the Grave de Peralta Private Estate. She is deeply mourned by everyone who knew her. We extend our sympathies to her family and friends."

2007-10-02T00:00:00Z,"A Brazilian electrician, Jean Charles de Menezes, was mistakenly killed by the police in the aftermath of the failed terror attack in London in July 2005 because of “fundamental failures” by the police, the prosecutor said at the opening of the trial of the department. The office of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police is charged with failing to ensure that the public, and ultimately Mr. de Menezes, were not put at risk during the surveillance and pursuit of a suspected suicide bomber. After a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, prosecutors decided that no individual officers would be charged in connection with the killing. The prosecutor for the trial, Clare Montgomery, described a “noisy and chaotic” operations room on the morning of July 22, a day after five men tried to detonate backpacks filled with explosives on the London transit system. “The police planned and carried out an operation that day so badly that the public were needlessly put at risk, and Jean Charles de Menezes was actually killed as a result,” she said."

2007-10-03T00:00:00Z,"AUDI--Alfred J., one of the most influential furniture manufacturers of his generation, died peacefully on September 29th at his home in Fayetteville, NY surrounded by his loving family. He was 69. Alfred J. Audi was born in Brooklyn, NY in 1938 to Dr. Rosa Lee Nemir Audi, one of the earliest woman physicians and E.J. Audi. Mr. Audi graduated from Colgate University in 1960. He served for three years in the Army National Guard in New York City's 42nd Infantry Division. He served as President of E.J. Audi, Inc., the furniture business founded by his father in 1928. In 1963, he married Aminy Inati in Beirut, Lebanon. They are members of Pebble Hill Presbyterian Church and earlier members of Plymouth Church in Brooklyn Heights, where he served on the Board of Deacons. Throughout the couple's 43-year marriage they were partners in all things and grew more deeply entwined each day. For more than three decades Mr. Audi presided over L. & J.G. Stickley Furniture, Inc., founded in 1900 and inspired by the American Arts and Crafts pioneer, Gustav Stickley. When he purchased Stickley Furniture in 1974, the company employed 22 people and operated out of a small outdated factory. Together with his wife Aminy, he nurtured the company back to health and eventually to the forefront of American culture. Today Stickley employs over 1600 dedicated employees whom the Audis consider their extended family. It is distributed internationally through a network of around 125 dealers. Stickley, Audi & Company, Stickley's retail division, has 13 locations in 5 states. Under Mr. Audi's direction the Stickley brand has gained a reputation for values he held dear: quality craftsmanship, corporate integrity, and timeless value. In 1974 Louise Stickley, widow of Leopold Stickley, called Mr. Audi as her business faced bankruptcy and said, ''Alfred, you're the only one who loves Stickley enough to keep its quality, would you buy it?'' Mr. Audi, who had grown up sleeping in a Stickley bed, and whose college fraternity at Colgate had Stickley throughout, recognized that despite the company's declining fortunes, it still enjoyed a reputation for quality craftsmanship. He believed that its style reflected an underlying human desire for a return to simplicity for the home, where furniture was functional and offered subtle elegance. For 11 years, Mr. Audi and his beloved wife and business partner, Aminy, worked on the infrastructure of Stickley, operating out of the small original Stickley factory on Orchard Street in Fayetteville, New York, now home of the Stickley Museum. In 1985, Mr. Audi built a new state of the art manufacturing facility in Manlius, New York, which after several expansions now exceeds 450,000 square feet. Mr. Audi's championing of Mission Oak in 1989 has sparked a massive resurgence in its popularity. Stickley's Mission Oak is now not only their most heavily sought-after style, but one that is emulated, today, in furniture stores nationwide. Until the very end, Mr. Audi credited the venerable international reputation enjoyed by L. & J.G. Stickley to the caliber of craftsmanship and work ethic of his employees. He had a talent for identifying and seeking out the highest caliber of colleagues and staff that exist in the industry. Mr. Audi was an avid sportsman, winning numerous awards in golf, squash, racquetball and bowling. In 2004, he won the New York State Super Senior Golf Championship, the Onondaga Golf and Country Club Men's Club Championship, the Onondaga Senior Club Championship and the Syracuse Senior District Match Play Championship. He was also the Squash Chairman of the Downtown Athletic Club and a member of the Metropolitan Squash Racquets Association. He was Squash Club Champion at the Heights Casino for three years. His many awards were complimented in 2006 when he received an Honorary Doctorate Degree from his alma mater, Colgate University. He was also nominated that same year for the manufacturers ''Furniture Hall of Fame.'' Together with his wife Aminy, Mr. Audi aptly received the prestigious Laurel Award from the International Furnishings and Design Association in 2004, for: ''furthering the Arts and Crafts movement in America.'' In 1997 they were recipients of the Ernst & Young Upstate New York Entrepreneurs of the Year Award and the 1995 recipients of the Syracuse Chamber of Commerce Business of the Year Award. In addition, Alfred was also named the 2004 recipient of the Community Team Spirit Award at the Salvation Army's Annual Civic Luncheon. Alfred Audi is survived by his wife, Aminy; son, Edward of Manlius; and daughters, Carolyn Audi Fischi and son-in-law Dr. Michael Fischi and Andrea of Fayetteville; three grandchildren; Anna Grace, Sophia Elizabeth and Paul Alfred Fischi; a sister, Elaine Audi Macken of New York City; a brother, Dr. Robert Audi and his wife Mary Louise of Indiana; and a nephew and four nieces. He is also survived by the Inati family, the Audi family and the nearly 1,600 Stickley employees. Relatives and friends may call at the Eaton - Tubbs - Schepp Funeral Home, Fayetteville, New York on Tuesday, October 2nd from 2-4pm and 6-8:30 pm and Wednesday, October 3rd from 2-4pm and 6-8:30pm.

In pleading for leniency at the sentencing, Mr. Josephberg's lawyer, Jared Scharf, argued that Mr. Josephberg's daughter Kara Paldino, who testified for the prosecution at trial, had carried out some of the acts for which her father was criminally convicted. But Ms. Paldino has not been charged with any crimes. Federal prosecutors told the court that the defense lawyer's claim was baseless, and the judge took no account of his argument in sentencing Mr. Josephberg to 50 months in jail."

The restaurant, far right, which is also open to the public, cost about $2 million to create, she said. Its mirrored ceiling, black-and-white tiled floor and leather banquettes create a ''masculine, chunky look,'' Ms. Bernerd said, that is offset by a column covered in Swarovski crystals, velvet chairs and Murano glass vases, above, on the tables.

''First we got runners out of cotton socks and into technical fabrics,'' said David Dowd, a buyer at the Chicago-area Fleet Feet Sports stores, where about 20 percent of the running socks sold are anatomical. ''Now, for socks to be most effective, they need to fit the foot like a second skin. It reduces friction and rubbing.''"

Surprisingly, in an era in which many designers work digitally, some of the most appealing pieces on display were handcrafted. Peter Ting, a designer for Asprey, the luxury goods retailer, offered an explanation. ''There's a debate going on in London between the virtues of digital and handmade goods,'' he said, and the appeal of one-offs -- to both designers and consumers -- is that ''they're beautiful and unique.''"

The first trimester was easy; somehow I bypassed all of the negative symptoms spewed throughout the first three chapters of every pregnancy book. I continue to laugh at the ""Whoaaa, Dairy Queen"" and ""Moooo-ve over"" jokes. Even the food and beverage restrictions, weight gain, emotional breakdowns and fatigue haven't been too bad. What I have been struggling with is the fact that I have to go back to work three months after the baby is born. I imagine that will be more emotionally taxing than getting on the C-130 to Iraq."

Nope. But the Gators hadn't lost at home under Meyer until last week either. Also it's an interesting weekend in the Big Ten. Can Purdue burst onto the national scene with a victory over Ohio State? Is Illinois for real? Can the Illini knock off No. 5 Wisconsin? Then comes the night cap, with Missouri hosting Nebraska in a huge game for the Big 12 North.

The privilege of owning private property within the national seashore brings with it many necessary regulations and inconveniences, including strict access and driving restrictions that are not for every homeowner.

No one was seriously injured. After a lengthy investigation with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the brewery, which like Stella Artois is a unit of the Belgian company InBev, said that the bottles were promotional items, intended for display.

Susan retorts: ''O.K., before we go any further, can I check these diplomas? Just to make sure they aren't, like, from some med school in the Philippines?'' Some viewers called to complain; more than 30,000 names were attached to an online petition seeking a network apology; in Manila, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said he was writing to the producers of the show to seek an apology and express the country's ''vehement protest.''

For the night, ABC ranked No. 1, finishing in first place at 8 with the premiere of ''Pushing Daisies'' (12.8 million).

2007-10-05T00:00:00Z,"ARTE Y PUREZA That means ''art and purity'' in Spanish, and those are virtues to which the Arte y Pureza Flamenco Company is devoted. Traditional flamenco can be adapted in many ingenious contemporary ways. But this troupe, based in Seville, Spain, hopes to get back to the roots of the art in its program ''Maestria.'' Appropriately enough, that means ''mastery.'' With its origins in the region known as Andalucía, flamenco is a Gypsy art of both music and dance that makes great use of improvisation to create a sense of emotional intensity. Arte y Pureza makes its New York debut on Wednesday at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, the last stop on an American tour that began in September. The group includes some singers and dancers who are highly regarded in Spain, among them Miguel Peña Vargas, a vocalist and dancer associated with a proud, roosterlike stance and a trademark white scarf and impeccable blue suit, reminders that flamenco requires meticulous details, as well as raw power. Mr. Vargas, also known as El Funi, is respected for remaining true to the great tradition of flamenco singing and his expertise in a multitude of rhythms."

Programmers took note of its strong reviews, big grosses and staying power over a four-week run on a single screen at the Film Forum, said Richard Abramowitz, a distribution consultant.

2007-10-05T00:00:00Z,"'JEON JOONHO: HYPER REALISM' The Korean artist Jeon Joonho is redecorating the White House. Not the building in Washington, but its representation on the reverse side of the $20 bill, as part of his explosive New York gallery debut at Perry Rubenstein Gallery in Chelsea. Into a digital rendering of the currency's familiar architectural scene, Mr. Jeon introduces a shadowy figure with a ladder and a paint roller, who, over several minutes, toils to cover the building's front windows and sandstone walls with glossy white paint. He even erases the decorative pediments above the ground floor windows on the facade, which gallery viewers attuned to architecture may notice is different from that of the current building; the White House has been substantially remodeled over its history of more than 200 years. It is a playful trick, transforming the White House from a stately neo-Classical mansion in the popular Palladian style into a kind of bunker or fortified castle -- a comment, perhaps, on the continuing hysteria surrounding the threat of terrorism inside the United States. The artist's ''whitewashing'' of the structure also lends itself to pointed political readings, though there is no mention of this in the gallery literature. Either way, this is powerful, thought-provoking art. (Through Oct. 13, Perry Rubenstein Gallery, 534 West 24th Street, Chelsea, 212-627-8000, perryrubenstein .com; Mr. Jeon's work is also on view at the gallery's other Chelsea spaces: 527 West 23rd Street and 526 West 24th Street.)

2007-10-05T00:00:00Z,"Martial Solal, who celebrated his 80th birthday six weeks ago, has few peers among jazz pianists. Strictly speaking, probably none. He's a probing modernist with a mercurial touch, but of course there are plenty of those. And he's a virtuoso technician often cited as the heir to Art Tatum: a rarer distinction, but not quite singular. What sets Mr. Solal, above, apart is a mode of extemporization at the keyboard that suggests both deep erudition and constant revelation. As with Tatum, facility is just one facet of his brilliance. Born and raised in Algiers, Mr. Solal moved to Paris in his early 20s and quickly fell in with the city's thriving jazz culture, working with French musicians, as well as prominent American expatriates. In short order he began composing film scores, including that of Jean-Luc Godard's ''Breathless.'' In 1963 he became one of the first European jazz musicians to perform at the Newport Jazz Festival, generating enough buzz to warrant a contract with RCA."

2007-10-05T00:00:00Z,"NATIONAL THEATER OF GREECE: 'ELECTRA' The eminent German director Peter Stein's 10-hour staging of ''Wallenstein,'' the trilogy of plays by Friedrich Schiller, closes this weekend in Berlin, but fortunately another of his directing efforts is coming soon and coming much closer. The National Theater of Greece returns to Manhattan for the sixth time in 12 years, this time with a production of Sophocles' ''Electra,'' directed by Mr. Stein and starring Stefania Goulioti (above, on her back) in the title role. The play, which runs just under two hours without an intermission, opens on Wednesday at City Center. Each of the three major Greek tragedians -- Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides -- wrote at some point about the cycle of violence and revenge that began with the Greek general Agamemnon's sacrifice of his daughter Iphigenia in return for wind to help Greek ships sail to Troy and wage the Trojan War. Agamemnon's wife, Clytemnestra, killed him in revenge, and several years later her son, Orestes, and daughter Electra conspired to avenge their father's death. They killed both their mother and her lover, Aegisthus. Each writer handled the details of the story differently, and Sophocles' version of the matricide is particularly noteworthy for its tender brother-sister reunion and the characterization of the oppressed and grieving Electra."

(HBO) BLOOD DIAMOND (2006) This ''exceptionally foolish thriller'' from Edward Zwick about conflict diamonds, wrote Manohla Dargis in The New York Times, stars ''a most excellent Leonardo DiCaprio'' as Danny Archer, a Rhodesian-born diamond smuggler chasing after Solomon Vandy (Djimon Housou, above right, with Mr. DiCaprio), a fisherman-turned-reluctant miner who has unearthed a precious pink diamond. (Both men were nominated for Oscars.) The next, obvious step is redemption, as Solomon races to get back to his family, and Danny trails him on a quest for the stone that could pay his way out of Africa. ''The tragedy of Sierra Leone and the complicity of Americans, who buy more diamonds than any other consumers in the world, deserve louder, more clamorous attention than the occasional news report,'' Ms. Dargis wrote. ''Yet while Mr. DiCaprio turns out to be an ideal fit for 'Blood Diamond,' there's an insolvable disconnect between this serious story and the frivolous way it has been told. There is no reason to doubt the filmmakers' sincerity; only their filmmaking.'' 10 A.M.

Anyway, I'd like to see them up close. And the jewelry and the belts. Prince worked on those with Jacobs as well.

2007-10-07T00:00:00Z,"Trunk Show The architect Antoine Predock has described the Dallas house he designed for Deedie and Rusty Rose as a ''theater of trees.'' The house is about ''viewing nature in different ways,'' confirms Deedie, who could also be talking about the couple's collection of contemporary art, which includes works like Rivane Neuenschwander's video of ants collecting confetti and Tony Cragg's wall sculpture of a tree reconstructed from discarded planks. Now, with the addition of Jennifer Steinkamp's video piece ''Eye Catching'' (2003), the 1915 Pump House (shown here) -- which sits adjacent to their property, and which the Roses bought in 2001 and had renovated by the architect Gary Cunningham -- has become a theater of trees all its own. The industrial building was once a source of water for the entire township of Highland Park; it still contains all of its pump equipment and can be flooded with some four inches of water for special occasions like barefoot black-tie parties. ''I don't look for a piece to go in a specific spot,'' says Deedie, who has never been timid in her tastes. ''I fall in love with a piece and then say to myself, Whatever am I going to do with this one?'' The life-size computeranimated tree, whose branches undulate hypnotically, as if blown by a constant imaginary wind, seems practically made for its new location in a former water tank. One of three trees in a work created by Steinkamp for the Istanbul Biennial, it was originally installed in the sixth-century Yerebatan cistern. (pg.P2 160); Great Halls of Fire When looking for just the place to install her new Bill Viola video piece, ''Fire Woman'' (2005), Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis had about 500 different rooms to choose from. The Thurn und Taxis castle in Regensburg, Germany, is still the family home, though some of the rooms are now open to the public. The palace's ornate décor has long served as a backdrop for the princess's art collection, which has at various times contained works ranging from the medieval and sacred to the contemporary and profane. For the Viola, which is a segment from ''The Tristan Project,'' a production of the Wagner opera ''Tristan und Isolde'' (a collaboration between the artist, the director Peter Sellars and the Los Angeles Philharmonic's music director, Esa-Pekka Salonen), it was not just a question of finding a room big enough and dim enough to properly view the roughly 10-by-20-foot piece -- certainly the castle has plenty of those -- but rather finding a room with the right karma. ''I like very much the spiritual aspect of the work,'' the princess says. ''I have the association of a rising Christ. And as I am a Catholic -- and it is very difficult to find contemporary sacred art -- I felt for this piece.'' The princess and Graham Southern, one of the founding directors of the European gallery Haunch of Venison, ultimately chose a wood-paneled reception room; the position in front of a grand fireplace hardly seems accidental. The princess has also invited the artist Candice Breitz to wander through the palace and select a site. Her piece ''King'' will no doubt feel entitled to go just about anywhere."

With what majesty the monarch held his lonely state above the level sea! Distance clothed him in a purple gloom, and added a veil of shimmering mist that so softened his rugged features that we seemed to see him through a web of silver gauze. His torch was out; his fires were smoldering; a tall column of smoke that rose up and lost itself in the growing moonlight was all the sign he gave that he was a living Autocrat of the Sea and not the spectre of a dead one.''"

Such self-referentiality could be squirm-inducing; here it's not -- or not very often. The story is slender enough: Boy meets girl, girl finds cheap walk-up on the Upper East Side (the Yorkville of the title), boy and girl work various jobs and try to get their songs heard."

Mr. Obama has clearly struck a chord among younger voters.

It is with profound sadness and deep affection that the Trustees and Staff of the American Museum of Natural History mourn the death of William T. Golden, our superb Chairman from 1989 to 1994, distinguished Chairman Emeritus thereafter, and an esteemed Trustee for nearly 40 years. Bill was one of the Museum's guiding stars whose wise counsel, incisive intelligence, passionate involvement, and commitment to science were unsurpassed. In his distinguished and highly influential career, Bill dedicated himself tirelessly to increasing the understanding of science among both the public and policymakers, championing public support of the scientific endeavor as an investment in our country's future, and fostering a scientifically literate citizenry. The Museum was enormously privileged to have his outstanding leadership and able hand during a time of important institutional growth and transformation. His leadership and longstanding generosity are captured in his role in helping the Museum advance the frontiers of science, including building vanguard research programs in such areas as microbial biology, and, perhaps most tangibly, in the beautiful Golden Corridor of Science, which extends through the Museum's research areas and bridges scientists and disciplines. It stands as a symbol of Bill's devotion to the scientific pursuit as a catalyst for the advancement of society and humanity, which was a hallmark of his remarkable life. He found unending joy and fascination in science and in the wonders of nature. In this and so many other ways, he will always be a touchstone for all of us at the Museum. He was a renaissance man, a great New Yorker, a great American, and a great citizen of the world. Most of all, Bill was the dearest of friends, forever young in spirit and intellect and we shall miss him terribly.

Such self-referentiality could be squirm-inducing; here it's not -- or not very often. The story is slender enough: Boy meets girl, girl finds cheap walk-up on the Upper East Side (the Yorkville of the title), boy and girl work various jobs and try to get their songs heard."

It is a sign of how important that concept is to the McLaren team. Take a look at Michael Schumacher's treatment at Ferrari and it is easy to see that the same concept of equality was never something that Ferrari particularly worried about. (Whether they were right or wrong is irrelevant, as is whether Schumacher deserved this or not. It could be argued that Schumacher was just so much better than most of his teammates that the team felt obliged to help him on a down day, knowing he would deliver in the end.) My point is that it is simply clear that Ferrari supported Schumacher over his teammates and did not worry about the concept of equality, whereas McLaren - which is being accused here and there of not treating both teammates equally - DOES value equality."

Rowan Jacobsen, the author of the book, ''A Geography of Oysters'' (Bloomsbury, $24.95), sorts out the oysters by species, by flavor and by region. There are details of oyster biology and oyster culture; these days, almost all oysters that are sold or served have been cultivated. Mr. Jacobsen has sound arguments for observing the ''R'' rule of eating oysters only in months with that letter because oysters from warmer water do not taste as good and can be a health risk when not cooked. And for the squeamish who resist the notion of eating a living creature, he offers this: ''Left in their natural environment, most oysters would be eaten by something: why shouldn't it be you?''"

2007-10-10T00:00:00Z,"VICENTE--Harriet. The Board of Directors, the Scientific Council members and the staff of NARSAD/The Mental Health Research Association (the world's largest philanthropic organization funding research on the causes, treatments and prevention of mental illnesses) mourn the death of our extraordinary, dedicated board member emeritus. Harriet joined the NARSAD board in 1992 at an early stage of our organization's program of providing research grants for the most promising research in our field. She was an active board member until taking an emeritus role in 2007. She was always a generous donor, providing support for outstanding young scientists engaged in breakthrough research, especially those with important new studies in genetics focused on the causes of severe mental disorders. She became a Research Partner supporting specific young scientists at pivotal moments in their research careers. Promising faculty members of Columbia and Rockefeller Universities were beneficiaries of her directed grant support. She particularly supported outstanding research progress in Spain, the homeland of her late husband, the distinguished artist Esteban Vicente. Beyond her financial support to scientists she gave them wise counsel and new opportunities. While serving as a director and an active donor, she also organized and led events to bring information about NARSAD's sponsored new research to her wide circle of acquaintances. She spoke to all enthusiastically against stigma and for possibilities of better treatments and cures for mental illnesses. Harriet Vicente's deep concern for those suffering for mental illness and her ever constructive efforts to help them were admired by all in our organization. We join all who knew her in deep sorrow at her passing. Geoffrey Birkett, President Constance E. Lieber, President Emeritus Herbert Pardes M.D., President of NARSAD Scientific Council Thomas Rabaut, Chairman VICENTE--Harriet, in her 87th year, died peacefully on October 4 from a cerebral hemorrhage. Harriet was born on April 6, 1921, in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, the elder daughter of Philip and Eva (Goell) Godfrey. She is survived by her sister, Ellen Marquis of San Francisco, her niece Tessa (Michael Brown), her nephew David (Beth), her great-nieces and nephews Nathaniel and Michael Leeds (Kiren) and Sophia Lee, the children of her deceased niece Lisa Lee (Arthur), and Mina Ebtehadj Marquis. An insatiable traveler since early childhood trips to Europe with her parents, with deep engagement during her adult years in a broad range of activities in, among other places, Spain, Israel and Turkey as well as in the United States, Harriet remained throughout her life an unabashedly enthusiastic New Yorker. Harriet's involvement in the art world began in the late 1940s when she and her then husband, Donald Peters (deceased 1960) became investors in the Samuel M. Kootz Gallery and assembled a notable collection of the then emerging New York school of abstract expressionist artists and European masters represented by Kootz. In 1958, while working as a volunteer in the Leo Castelli Gallery, she was introduced to Esteban Vicente who was having a show of his drawings at the gallery. In 1961, a year after her husband's death, she and Esteban were married. A committed Zionist since youth, Harriet, under the auspices of the Jerusalem Foundation, sponsored two projects with the aim of promoting peace between the Jewish and Arab communities. In 1980, she sponsored a playground in memory of her late daughter, Alison Peters, on the boundary between the two communities to provide a safe place for Arab and Jewish children to come together to play. A month before her death, Harriet provided additional funding to restore and enhance the park and provide for its future upkeep. Since 2003, Harriet has also sponsored the Independent Skills Program for young Arab women at the Beit David Community Center, located in the Arab Wadi Joz neighborhood of Jerusalem. Harriet was a founding member and on the Executive Board of the Women's Division of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2004. From 1992 until her retirement to Emeritus status in 2006, Harriet served as a board member of NARSAD, The Mental Health Research Association, which is the world's largest nongovernmental agency funding research on the causes, treatment and prevention of mental illness, including schizophrenia, depression and a range of other serious neuropsychiatric disorders. Long interested in developing ties with Spain, in 1997 Harriet supported a NARSAD Young Investigators Award to Dr. Enrique Baca - Garcia, a young Spanish researcher who went on to become one of the most influential persons in introducing advanced psychiatric knowledge and treatment to the Iberian Peninsula. Last year, she provided support for Dr. Garcia's sabbatical year spent at the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry in New York updating his knowledge of cutting-edge methodologies to take back to his university in Madrid. In 1998, Harriet was instrumental in the founding by the Province of Segovia of the Esteban Vicente Museum of Contemporary Art in Segovia, Spain, Esteban's birthplace. The museum and community center was made possible by the joint gift of Harriet and Esteban of 150 of Vicente's works. Harriet was Honorary President of the museum whose governing board is a consortium of public officials from the national, regional, provincial and city governments, as well as corporate and private members. The regional government of Castile-Leon has recently funded a major expansion of the museum in connection with which Harriet undertook to provide the annual operating budget of the new addition. In 1999, the King of Spain awarded Harriet, together with Esteban, the Gran Cruz de la Orden de Alfonso X el Sabio (Grand Cross of Alfonso the Wise), a decoration established in 1902 to honor extraordinary contributions by Spaniards or foreigners to Spanish education, science, culture and research. In 2000, Harriet endowed an annual Vicente fellowship to enable mid-career Spanish artists to live and work at Yaddo, the artists' community in Saratoga Springs, New York. In 2002, Harriet joined The Rockefeller University Council, the University's most distinguished group of benefactors and friends, where she established the Esteban Vicente Postdoctoral Fellowship for young investigators in the field of mental illness. She has also been a generous supporter of the University's Women & Science initiative. In 2006 Harriet was instrumental in the creation in P.S. 170 of an in-school and after-school program of music and art. P.S. 170 is an early childhood public school in the South Bronx with a predominantly Hispanic population. By a vote of the parents, the name of the school has been changed to the Esteban Vicente School, with the purpose of encouraging identification of the students with a highly successful and distinguished Hispanic artist. In accordance with Harriet's wishes, her ashes will be buried, beside those of Esteban, in the garden of the Vicente museum in Segovia on a date to be determined. The interment will be open to any who may wish to attend. A memorial will be held in New York also at a later date. Contributions in Harriet's honor may be made to NARSAD at 60 Cutter Mill Road, Great Neck, NY 11021 or to the Harriet and Esteban Vicente Foundation at 501 Fifth Avenue, Suite 1803, New York, NY 10017. VICENTE--Harriet. To the students, staff and parents of The Esteban Vicente School, Harriet was an inspiring presence and a true believer in the power of art to inspire and motivate children. When PS 170, an Early Childhood School in the South Bronx, voted in 2006 to change its name to The Esteban Vicente School, Mrs. Vicente responded. She was instrumental in helping us further her husband's legacy and support our mission to educate children both academically and creatively. Mrs. Vicente shared her energy and belief in art's transformative power with our children and inspired them to think of art as an essential part of their lives. Thanks to her generous support, The Esteban Vicente School now offers yearlong dance, visual arts, songwriting and music programs for all children. Our community will always fondly remember our abuela, Harriet Vicente. The Students, Staff and Parents of The Esteban Vicente School VICENTE--Harriet. The Board of Directors of the Esteban Vicente Museum of Contemporary Art deeply regrets the loss of its Honorary President, Harriet Vicente. Her kindness, enthusiasm and experience in the art world were as valuable as her economic support. We, who had the pleasure and honor of meeting her either in business meetings or informal situations want to emphasize her genius in identifying priorities and challenges. Especially interested in education, she often expressed her desire to strengthen that area in our institution. Her constant aim was to insure that the youngest children could gain access to the art world and, on the other hand that the artists could work with both passion and means. Regarding the latter, we must remember her biannual sponsorship of a Yaddo fellowship, which allowed a Spanish artist to spend a month in an extraordinary residency for creators. We are indebted to her for her joint donation, with Esteban Vicente, of 152 works for the permanent collection of the museum, as well as the subsequent donations she made of other works by Esteban plus his personal library. Above all, we are indebted to her for her generous sponsorship of the museum, undoubtedly the most important cultural institution in Castile Leon. For these contributions, among others, in 1999 she was awarded the Gran Cruz de la Orden de Alfonso X. Her indefatigable dedication to the arts, her personal charm and her loyalty to the museum, in addition to an innate intelligence that had not decreased with the passage of years, make her departure especially sad. Therefore, we want to join in their sorrow all those who enjoyed her friendship, love and generosity. Javier Santamara, Pres. Provincial Council of Segovia Pedro Arahuetes, Mayor, City of Segovia Jos Jimnez, Ministry of Culture Mara Jos Salgueiro, Minister of Culture of Castile Leon Manuel Escribano Soto, Director de Caja de Ahorros de Segovia Jos Antonio Lopez, CEO, Iberpistas, S.A Carlos Mara Martnez, Director, Caja de Madrid Ambassador Jos Luis Pardos Fernando Escard Elvira Gonzalez Jos Mara Parreo, Director of the Museum Atilano Soto, Founder President of the Museum VICENTE--Harriet. The Rockefeller University deeply mourns the loss of Harriet Vicente, a cherished member of The Rockefeller University Council. We are fortunate to have known this warm and generous - hearted woman. Harriet embraced the research of scientists working at the frontiers of biomedicine by establishing the Esteban Vicente Postdoctoral Fellowship for talented young investigators conducting research related to mental illness. A tireless ambassador and advocate for Rockefeller, she was also a generous supporter of the University's Women & Science initiative. We celebrate Harriet's keen intellect, her wit, and her great generosity, and compassion for artists in all walks of life. Harriet believed that scientists are creative individuals, and she was attracted by the University's commitment to nurturing scientific creativity and its integration of the arts and humanities with science. In 2003, Harriet Vicente donated to the University a vibrant abstract painting entitled Tremor by her late husband, Esteban Vicente. Given on the 100th anniversary of Esteban Vicente's birth, Tremor will be a permanent reminder to the University community of this unique and remarkable woman, and her intrepid and ever - fascinating journey through life. Harriet, herself, was an artist at friendships. She will be greatly missed by the Rockefeller community. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her family and all who loved her. David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Richard Furlaud, Chairman Emeritus and Council Chair Paul Nurse, President Torsten Wiesel, President Emeritus Marnie Imhoff, Vice President The Rockefeller University"

Among the drawings for the 1908 Boynton House in Rochester, N.Y., were studies for a dining chair that curved in two directions, to support the lumbar area and to cradle the shoulders -- a radically different design from the flat-back shape of most of the Prairie-era chairs. To bring Wright's vision to life, Mr. Copeland converted the sketch, above, into a computer image and asked a custom laminating firm to build a mold on which five layers of quarter-sawn oak could be stretched and sealed together. The resulting side chair ($949), right, and armchair ($1,149), introduced this month along with a matching dining table (starting at $4,999), can be ordered now for February delivery.

2007-10-11T00:00:00Z,"An exhibition and sale of sculpture by Yonel Lebovici, the late French artist, opens today at Maison Gerard. Many of Mr. Lebovici's works were inspired by everyday objects, and are both decorative and functional. Although Mr. Lebovici is relatively unknown in the United States, his influence can be seen in the work of Pop artists like Claes Oldenburg: The oversize safety-pin lamp Mr. Lebovici made in 1980 ($150,000) predated Oldenburg's giant safety pin by nearly 20 years. The show also includes the 1969 Satellite Lamp ($42,000), above; the 1988 Thon Bar ($150,000), which resembles a giant tuna; and a pair of doors called Les Yeux ($275,000) with mechanical eyes.

2007-10-11T00:00:00Z,"In the late 1700s wealthy merchants in Salem, Mass., flaunted their cosmopolitan taste by commissioning neo-Classical buildings and furniture from Samuel McIntire, a self-taught local architect. McIntire (shown in a circa 1786 portrait above) designed many of the colonnaded houses and public buildings in town, and carved scrollwork and foliage into countless chairs and tables. A number of those pieces, as well as mantels and paneled rooms, will be part of an exhibition of his work opening Saturday at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem. Dean T.

2007-10-11T00:00:00Z,"The renovation of the Royalton Hotel was done so quickly that many probably didn't even notice it had temporarily closed. In just four months, the firm of Roman and Williams completely transformed a lobby designed by Philippe Starck that some considered iconic (and others dated) into a space that Mari Balestrazzi, the vice president of design for Morgans Hotel Group, says she ''hopes people will think of as a new living room in the city.'' A lobby that once revealed itself immediately from the entrance is now broken down into smaller seating areas, visible first through a massive fireplace with textured iron surround, top right. Colors go from dark to light from the lobby to the restaurant, Brasserie Forty-Four, bottom near right, also designed by Roman and Williams and owned by John McDonald. Redesign of the rooms, bottom far right, however, was perhaps appropriately assigned to Charlotte Macaux Perelman, of Studio CMP, who had worked for Mr. Starck on hotel projects like the Sanderson in London. ''I wanted to keep some of the Philippe gestures, like the bed niche and the fireplace, just making it more sexy and up-to-date,'' Ms. Perelman said. She kept the round bathtubs but surrounded them with mirrored mosaic tiles and a rain-effect shower head. Very sexy indeed. RIMA SUQI"

It easily outpaced its time-slot competitors, NBC’s “Bionic Woman” (10.1 million) and CBS’s “Criminal Minds,” which tied for second in that demographic. “Criminal Minds” attracted the night’s largest audience over all (14.5 million), helping CBS surpass ABC in total viewers for the night. CBS struggled at 8, however, as “Kid Nation” (7 million) ranked last in the hour in the 18-to-49 set. “Pushing Daisies” (10.1 million) led the time slot in that demographic, although its ratings fell 16 percent from its premiere a week ago."

The film company and Ms. Rowling, creator of the adventures of Harry Potter, a Hogwarts student, are seeking two million rupees (about $50,000) for breach of copyright. “We had no clue that we had to seek permission from the author,” said Santanu Biswas, secretary of the community group that designed and paid for artists to make the pandal, a temporary structure to the goddess Durga. “We do not have any commercial motive behind this.” The four-day festival begins on Wednesday in Kolkata.

Ms. Mandle laughed while recounting the story recently in her Brooklyn studio, but it's clear that she wants to change people with her arresting performance-art pieces -- or at least make them pause and think about the world and how they move through it. She describes ''Chicky Meal'' as a live sculpture, a ''portrait of America going through an identity crisis.'' Part installation and part performance, it explores how Americans' perceptions of themselves line up with the nation's image abroad. Three women, costumed in Ms. Mandle's striking, structured gowns (embroidered with anti-American slogans), interact languidly with a white, star-shaped structure, spreading charcoal stains along the pocked, damaged walls. A fourth woman, the one wearing the giant chicken head, moves more rapidly and plays the role of seductress. (Her dress reads, ''I said I was Canadian while traveling abroad.'') Perhaps she is a metaphor for the lure of American popular culture."

2007-10-12T00:00:00Z,"SHERRIE LEVINE As the Richard Prince exhibition plays at the Guggenheim, spare a thought for Sherrie Levine, another 1980s appropriation artist, who has a survey show at Nyehaus Gallery in Gramercy Park. On view are several examples of her reworking of sculptures, drawings, paintings and photographs as part of a wider questioning of the authenticity of art and its status as a commodity. What we all know now is that she was just making more commodities, cleverly repackaged as critique. But it is still fun and instructive to return to a moment when artists were -- back then, boldly -- taking the works of other artists and reproducing them, sometimes almost exactly, and claiming them as their own. It is extraordinary now to think that there weren't a flood of lawsuits surrounding this process. For example, a 1981 photograph here of a photograph by Walker Evans looks exactly like, well, a photograph by Walker Evans. The same goes for a photograph after Alexander Rodchenko, and replicas of sculpture by Brancusi and Duchamp."

2007-10-12T00:00:00Z,"FILARMONICA DELLA SCALA Opera houses and their orchestras often have a complicated relationship. In Leipzig and Vienna, the leading orchestras (the Gewandhaus and the Vienna Philharmonic) do double duty in the opera house. In Berlin and at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, the orchestra breaks out of the opera house for an occasional concert or even tour (the Berlin Staatskapelle under Daniel Barenboim, the Met orchestra under James Levine). But in Milan, the Filarmonica della Scala postdates its eponymous opera house, the Teatro alla Scala, by a century or so. The orchestra was not founded until 1982, when Claudio Abbado conducted its first concert, presented as a way to offer the theater's musicians a deeper immersion in the symphonic repertory as a self-governing body."

2007-10-14T09:38:58Z,"Novel? Epic poem? Historical chronicle? ""War and Peace"" is all of that and, as they say, more. This is the third time I've read it. The first was incollege for one of those loony world-lit survey courses: two weeks for ""Don Quixote,"" another two for ""Bleak House,"" etc. I missed so much of the novel; I remember skimming the war parts to get to the peace parts. The second time was right after 9/11, and the book just seemed like reportage: the generalized anxiety, the fragility, the terrifying ease with which the world can change. This time, (maybe it's my post-Reading-Like-a-Writer phase) I've been trying to figure out how Tolstoy does what he does, and what I can't get over is the almost reckless wildness of his ambition, the sheer nervy bravado of his technical competence. Anyone who's ever tried to write fiction knows how hard it is to introduce characters, one or two at a time. Even Dickens makes sure you get a character fixed in your mind before he moves on to the next one. But Tolstoy essentially starts the book, or at least the second chapter, by plunking you down in a room crowded with major and minor characters, all talking at once, then the action moves to another room filled with completely different characters, then another household, then the home of a dying man, a house in the country, then a battle. Deal with it. And the amazing thing is that the reader can keep it all sorted out  the identities, the familial relations, the histories and hopes and fears of a huge cast. Reading it feels a little like looking at a Velásquez and trying to figure out how he puts a few dots of white paint at the end of his brush, and bingo! a string of pearls just wills itself into being."
