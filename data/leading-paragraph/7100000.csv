2008-07-30T00:00:00Z,"RICHMOND--Julius B., M.D. It is with profound sadness that the members of the Board of Trustees of the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI) note the passing of our beloved friend, mentor and educator --Julius B. Richmond, M.D. --formerly Surgeon General of the United States. Dr. Richmond over his long, diversified and splendid career did as much as anyone to protect and improve the health of his fellow citizens, and in particular children and adolescents. From 1953 to 1965 Dr. Richmond was chairman and professor of the Department of Pediatrics at the State University of New York, SUNY College of Medicine and became dean in 1965, serving in that capacity until 1970. In 1965 Dr. Richmond was appointed by President Johnson as the first national director of Project Head Start in the Office of Economic Opportunity. Head Start became a year-round program after the first summer; approximately 750,000 children are enrolled in Project Head Start each year in approximately 1,500 centers across the United States. Head Start is a comprehensive child development program. In 1971 Dr. Richmond was recruited by the Harvard Medical School where he became a professor of psychiatry and human development and chairman and professor of the Department of Social and Preventative Medicine. Simultaneously, he was appointed professor of public health in the School of Public Health at Harvard. While at Harvard, Dr. Richmond was honored to receive a presidential dual appointment as both Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. Both positions required senate confirmation. Dr. Richmond was the first individual ever selected to occupy both positions. He had the responsibility in the federal public health sector for some 50,000 employees. During his tenure as Surgeon General, Dr. Richmond focused on tobacco control efforts through the publication of the 1979 Surgeon Generals Report, presenting overwhelming scientific evidence of the multiple harms caused by smoking. Dr. Richmond has received a number of honorary degrees including ones from Yale and Harvard. He continued his professional activities as the John D. McCarthy Professor of Health Policy Emeritus, monitoring students and colleagues, right up until the last couple of months. He continued to teach and write, striving to shape health policies for health promotion and disease prevention, with a special emphasis on children and families as well as the low income population. Dr. Richmond was a brilliant, caring, hands-on pediatrician for nearly 70 years. In later years he took on the onerous task of continuing to educate the public by testifying in open court about the dangers of tobacco and how the industry had for decades manipulated scientific data. In doing so Dr. Richmond voluntarily subjected himself to many days of grueling cross-examination, and he did this while refusing to accept compensation as a skilled expert witness. As Chairman of FA MRI's Medical Advisory Board, Dr. Richmond was vital to the Board of Trustees in helping to direct over $200,000,000 in grants to some of the finest medical schools and research institutions in America and the world --including five Centers of Excellence. The scientific research is aimed at eradicating the diseases caused by exposure to second hand tobacco smoke, the money having resulted from a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of nonsmoking flight attendants against the tobacco industry. Dr. Richmond had one of the most extraordinary and productive careers in the history of American monitoring science and public education. His professional accomplishments were mirrored by his sterling character traits. His sense of humor was legendary as was his refusal to acknowledge his own importance. He was endlessly patient, civil, tolerant, incredibly well-informed and a true pleasure to be around. The members of the Board of Trustees of FA MRI are eternally grateful for the guidance of Dr. Richmond over the past decade as well as for the pure pleasure of his company and insights.

June was a remarkable woman with a fierce devotion to her family, determined to secure a rich Jewish life for her children and grandchildren. This was to be her most enduring legacy. Born into Zionism, she was a dedicated and tireless leader, demanding and passionate about Israel and the Jewish people.

A bold thinker and a trusted friend to so many, she was described as a courageous dreamer of extraordinary dreams, committed to the well-being of others. Recognized for her extensive knowledge in the fields of education and healthcare, June worked for many years as a respiratory therapist at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital, and ardently advocated for the betterment of the healthcare systems in America and in Israel. A lifetime of aspirations and achievements were proudly realized when June was recognized by Haifa University this past June with an honorary doctorate. June demonstrated unparalleled strength, commitment and humanity, even as she bravely battled the illness that finally took her life. She will continue to be respected and admired for her courage, her optimism and her sense of purpose. June will truly be missed by her Hadassah family and so many others whose lives she touched. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her husband, Barrett, her three children and six grandchildren, and may they find solace knowing she lived a full and meaningful life.

Leaders of the US and Israel held her high in regard and recognized her integrity, intelligence and sincerity of her advocacy. This was reflected in her unanimous election as Chairperson in 2007 and again in 2008. Similarly, she served with distinction as President of Hadassah. We pray that her entire family will be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. The funeral will be on Thursday, July 31th at 11am at Congregation Beth Hatikvah, 36 Chatham Road, Summit, NJ. Malcolm Hoenlein Executive Vice Chairman WALKER--June.

She is survived by four children: Mary Lou Cohalan of Bayport, Susan Roos of Brooklyn Heights, Robert and Barbara Kjeldsen of Babylon, and David and Deborah Kjeldsen of West Islip. A son, Peter, predeceased her, as did her husband of 62 years, Norman.

Dedicated to community service, she served 45 years as a volunteer at Good Samaritan Hospital where she was a familiar figure at the main reception desk. She also supported the Hospitality Center at St. Patrick's R.C. Church in Bay Shore and numerous civic organizations in Islip and Babylon Town. Born in Chicago to Eunice and John B. Noone, she grew up in Douglaston, NY. A member of the Greatest Generation, she married Norman Kjeldsen, a naval officer, in 1941.

In 1958, when the Virginian governor closed public schools in defiance of a Supreme Court order to integrate them, she joined an ad hoc group that sued the State on behalf of displaced students. The suit, and the yearlong struggle to reopen schools, was the subject of a non-fiction book recounting the episode. An avid reader, she was interested in politics, current events and the world around her. She attended monthly lectures at the Foreign Policy Institute in Manhattan, studied French culture and language, which she spoke fluently, and took pride in having visited all the continents, included Antarctica.

The last time dinosaurs charged through its halls they were trying to devour Matthew Broderick and other innocent souls in the 1998 ''Godzilla'' remake. Now these reptiles are back and better behaved, at least toward people. But when it comes to the species' fellow creatures, the game is still eat or be eaten. That interplay is at the heart of ''Walking With Dinosaurs -- the Live Experience,'' which opened on Wednesday at the Garden. The touring show, which compresses some 200 million years of evolution into almost two hours (there's a long intermission), features 10 big (really big) stars like Brachiosauruses (above), Torosauruses and of course Tyrannosaurus rexes. Each life-size animatronic creation is controlled by a team using computers and hydraulics. ''It's like a giant remote-control car,'' said Scott Faris, the production's director. Five smaller species, including three Utahraptors, are wearable puppets, the ultimate Halloween costumes."

2008-08-03T00:00:00Z,"LETTERI--Joseph M., M.D. Established the care of patients with kidney disease on Long Island and helped create National and International guidelines and standards for dialysis. Joseph M. Letteri, born in Brooklyn 75 years ago, passed away suddenly on June 1, 2008 while visiting his ''old haunts'' in Tuscany with his beloved wife, Mary. His home was in Sands Point, NY, on Long Island. Dr. Letteri attended St. Peter's College in Jersey City and later, while attending Georgetown Medical School, was greatly influenced by Dr. George Schreiner, a pioneer in the study of kidney disease and dialysis. His further studies were at NYU and at Jefferson Medical College with Lawrence Wesson, M.D., and at Harvard with John Merrill, M.D., all of whom were early leaders in this new field of Nephrology. To fulfill the military obligation required of physicians at the time, he served in the United States Air Force at Wiesbaden Germany, as a specialist in kidney disease with the rank of Captain. Dr. Letteri became Chief of the Division of Nephrology at Nassau County Medical Center and moved to Long Island with his family in 1970. He established the teaching program in kidney disease that has produced many of the kidney specialists now caring for patients on Long Island. He was the first to bring sophisticated diagnostic and treatment methods for kidney disease to the people of Long Island and began dialysis for those whose kidneys had failed. When the State University of New York at Stony Brook began its medical school, Dr. Letteri was in the forefront in organizing the curriculum for instruction in kidney disease for medical students. His research studying the bone disease of renal failure patients at Brookhaven National Laboratories was also groundbreaking. Dr. Letteri rose to the rank of Professor of Medicine at Stony Brook. His activities included work with The National Kidney Foundation on the Medical Advisory Board for New York and later as the National Chairman of The Dialysis Committee that developed the guidelines for Dialysis. In 1987, The National Kidney Foundation presented him with the Lester Hoenig Award for outstanding contributions in Nephrology. His patients will attest to the fact that with all his accomplishments, above all he was a warm and caring doctor. Dr. Letteri was a sensitive parent and family man. He will be greatly missed by Mary, his wife of 48 years, his son Jeffrey Letteri and wife Mary Ann, and his daughter Marisa McCusker and her husband Jeffrey, and his grandchildren John, Austin and Meagan McCusker."

2008-08-03T00:00:00Z,"THE FACTS Unlike individual gymnastic events, the team event is less about ego than national pride; think of it as one big Danskin-clad chest-bump. The strongest three women on each team go head to head on the vault, uneven bars, balance beam and floor; men follow the same format on the pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars and high bar. ''At the Olympic level, gymnastics becomes a lot more mental than physical,'' says Ron Galimore, a vice president of USA Gymnastics, the sport's governing body. ''With so much pressure, so many little things can go wrong.''"

And once you cross that threshold of acceptable leave of absence, people start grumbling. I do miss baseball in some ways, but one thing I don't miss is the sacrifices you're expected to make in the face of life-changing events. There is a game pretty much every day, and to be absent from one is unheard of. You have to be dead, or someone else has to be dead, and after a day or two any excuse short of that is frowned upon."

''I went with my husband and my sister -- there were 15 of us, 3 men and 12 women. My husband liked that. It was a walking trip, walking from one hotel to another for 11 days. We walked every day, from about 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., in the woods, on the hills, in the mud. Sometimes we passed a small village, and we drank a little local wine, which was very nice, but it was always raining, so we didn't see many people. It was silent in the woods and in the small villages; it was peaceful, but the rain was terrible. My husband sometimes travels to the Himalayas -- to Nepal and Tibet -- but I only travel to countries in Europe, and always with a group. I prefer to sleep in a hotel, not in tents any longer. For me, traveling is mostly about seeing local habits and local people and hearing the language and seeing the nature. And it's laughing -- traveling in a group, it's always nice to meet new people.'' As told to Austin Considine"

2008-08-03T00:00:00Z,"THE FACTS The longest of the sprints, the 400 meters -- one complete lap around the track -- calls for an uncommon mix of speed and endurance. While the 100-meter dash demands that runners explode off the blocks and proceed at full speed, the 400 is more of a gradual build. Some runners go out fast, while others hang back and try to control the second 200. Regardless, by the 300-meter mark, the pack has usually converged briefly before spreading out again during the final 100-meter homestretch, when the leaders make their surge. ''Anybody's capable of running a fast 300 meters,'' Harvey Glance says. ''It's the person who can control the last 100 meters who usually wins.''"

It's the closest metric approximation to the mile, and winning requires equal parts speed, endurance and cunning. Jostling is a given, and as long as a runner doesn't impede the progress of a competitor, elbow jabs and shin kicks are fair game. The pack of runners moves like an organism, constantly changing shape, and all sorts of accidents can happen. Which, for the viewer at home, means three and a half minutes of fun and mayhem."

2008-08-03T00:00:00Z,"THE FACTS At roughly 10 seconds in length, track and field's shortest Olympic race is also its most glamorous: the winner is anointed the fastest human alive. The American Carl Lewis gave the race its modern-day sizzle at the 1984 Olympics (it was one of four gold medals he won at those Games). Since then, the 100 has gained notoriety of a different sort, thanks to drug scandals beginning with that of Ben Johnson of Canada, who lost his 1988 gold medal after testing positive for steroids. Britain's Linford Christie, who won the gold medal in 1992, was banned from the sport for two years for alleged drug use; the American Tim Montgomery was stripped of his world record in 2005. And then there's Marion Jones, the former 2000 American gold medalist currently serving a six-month prison term for perjury involving her own steroid use."

2008-08-03T00:00:00Z,"THE FACTS When Jim Thorpe won the first Olympic gold in the decathlon in 1912, King Gustav V of Sweden told him, ''Sir, you are the world's greatest athlete.'' Since then, the 10-event contest of speed, strength and agility has been the benchmark of track-and-field supremacy. Not only do champion decathletes run (nearly) as fast and jump (nearly) as far as many of the top athletes in individual events, they also do so over two grueling, 11-to-12-hour days. Day 1 consists of the 100-meter dash, the long jump, the shot-put, the high jump and the 400-meter dash. Then it all starts over again the next day with the 110-meter hurdles, the discus throw, the pole vault, the javelin and -- finally -- the 1,500-meter run, which may as well be a marathon after all that exertion. Women perform their own version of this multisport masochism in the seven-event heptathlon."

2008-08-03T00:00:00Z,"THE FACTS It used to be that to medal in this frenetic race -- two pool lengths each of butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle -- you had to be strong in only three strokes. Now, thanks to the likes of Michael Phelps, swimmers can't afford a weakness. Though butterfly requires extra coordination, it delivers a jolt of speed. Backstroke may look awkward, but it allows easy breathing. ''Breaststroke's the toughest by far,'' says Eddie Reese, the head coach of the United States men's squad. The final and fastest lap is freestyle, which allows competitors to make up for lost time -- about three seconds, if they're flying. Since the I.M. is all about quick-change versatility, it offers some of the most frequent ''Holy cow!'' moments of the Games."

2008-08-03T00:00:00Z,"THE FACTS Olympic diving is like high-stakes aerial gymnastics: who can pack the most intricate and flawless combination of twists, flips and pikes into mere seconds of free fall? Whether divers are handstanding off the 10-meter platform or launching from the 3-meter springboard, success is in the splash -- the smaller, the better. ''As the last thing the judges see, it can put an exclamation mark on a great dive, and it can also earn a mediocre dive solid scores,'' says the University of Texas diving coach and former Olympian Matt Scoggin. Just as they hit the water, divers pull their hands apart, creating a hole in the surface of the water for their body to slide through; this is called ''ripping the entry.'' Unlike the flabby smack of a belly-flop, the sound of a body hitting the water perfectly at 35 miles per hour is akin to ''paper being torn apart,'' says the United States' Laura Wilkinson, who won gold in the platform at the 2000 Games. ''It's pretty breathtaking.''"

Joseph M. Letteri, born in Brooklyn 75 years ago, passed away suddenly on June 1, 2008 while visiting his ''old haunts'' in Tuscany with his beloved wife, Mary. His home was in Sands Point, NY, on Long Island. Dr. Letteri attended St. Peter's College in Jersey City and later, while attending Georgetown Medical School, was greatly influenced by Dr. George Schreiner, a pioneer in the study of kidney disease and dialysis. His further studies were at NYU and at Jefferson Medical College with Lawrence Wesson, M.D., and at Harvard with John Merrill, M.D., all of whom were early leaders in this new field of Nephrology. To fulfill the military obligation required of physicians at the time, he served in the United States Air Force at Wiesbaden Germany, as a specialist in kidney disease with the rank of Captain. Dr. Letteri became Chief of the Division of Nephrology at Nassau County Medical Center and moved to Long Island with his family in 1970. He established the teaching program in kidney disease that has produced many of the kidney specialists now caring for patients on Long Island. He was the first to bring sophisticated diagnostic and treatment methods for kidney disease to the people of Long Island and began dialysis for those whose kidneys had failed. When the State University of New York at Stony Brook began its medical school, Dr. Letteri was in the forefront in organizing the curriculum for instruction in kidney disease for medical students. His research studying the bone disease of renal failure patients at Brookhaven National Laboratories was also groundbreaking. Dr. Letteri rose to the rank of Professor of Medicine at Stony Brook. His activities included work with The National Kidney Foundation on the Medical Advisory Board for New York and later as the National Chairman of The Dialysis Committee that developed the guidelines for Dialysis. In 1987, The National Kidney Foundation presented him with the Lester Hoenig Award for outstanding contributions in Nephrology. His patients will attest to the fact that with all his accomplishments, above all he was a warm and caring doctor. Dr. Letteri was a sensitive parent and family man. He will be greatly missed by Mary, his wife of 48 years, his son Jeffrey Letteri and wife Mary Ann, and his daughter Marisa McCusker and her husband Jeffrey, and his grandchildren John, Austin and Meagan McCusker."

It was about 60 miles and I could do it comfortably over three days. Why this walk along this coast? Well, the soil here - loess or clay - was deposited during the last ice age, and ever since then the long shore drift has been carrying it away to the south. The Holderness is, in point of fact, the fastest-eroding coast in Europe, with some six feet a year being lost to the North Sea."

In the United States and Europe, sulfur dioxide emissions have been substantially cut, but only in the last several decades and after the specter of acid rain gained front-page status.

He made Woodstock his home during the last few years of his life, where he continued to be active in the arts.

Just have a look at this news conference statement by the committee president, Jacques Rogge: ""The fog you see is based on the basis of humidity and heat. It does not mean to say that this fog is the same as pollution. It can be pollution, but the fog doesn't mean necessarily that it is pollution.""Researchers Flee Stranded Bear- Scientists from the Wildlife Conservation Society had their field research on ecological impacts of eroding Arctic coasts near Prudhoe Bay interrupted by a polar bear that was stuck ashore because the sea ice in that part of Alaska was far offshore. Their bush pilot advised them to decamp, and they did. Polar bears in Alaska appear to be having a harder time than in some other parts of the Arctic, according to federal wildlife officials.Tropics: Heat = Deluge- Finally, I've written a story for Friday's paper on a study in Science Express clearly linking warmer stretches in the tropics to more frequent extreme downpours, the kind that can swamp a city with poor drainage, causing economic havoc and spreading waterborne illness. The study, by British and American scientists, found that the observed peaks in extreme rain events are about twice as high as what global climate simulations produce. This means that a) the models need work (a lot of scientists agree that they don't do well with precipitation, b) the satellite measurements are wrong (less likely), or c) some of both. Over all, the authors and other climatologists told me, the link strongly implies that a warming world will be a more downpour-prone world. That means trouble because of rising populations in vulnerable regions. Go to the international Flood Resilience Network and the Asia-Pacific Water Forum for what this means on the ground."

In her private life, Kappy was a great fan of jazz music. She was a voracious reader and lifelong seeker of philosophical truth.

2008-08-08T00:00:00Z,"SILBERKLEIT--Michael I. , the chairman of Archie Comic Publications, died August 5th in New York City at the age of 76, after a short battle with cancer. For much of the 60 years he worked at Archie Comics, Silberkleit shared the leadership of the company with Richard Goldwater, whose father, John Goldwater, and his partner, Louis Silberkleit, Michael's father, founded the company. The sons, who began working at the company as boys, later steered Archie Comics into the modern era of publishing as electronic production techniques and brand licensing became important. They encouraged the development of new characters, such as Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, and Josie and the Pussycats, and successfully licensed these and other characters through Archie Comics Entertainment. Silberkleit was also Executive consultant to the TV program, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, a long running series starring Melissa Joan Hart. The company also published comic books as a licensee, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Sonic the Hedgehog. At various times Silberkleit was chairman of the Comics Association of America. The centerpiece identity of the company, which is based in Mamaroneck, New York, remains the brightly innocent presence of Archie and his girlfriends, Betty and Veronica, who made their comic debut in 1941. Over the decades Michael Silberkleit and Richard Goldwater steadfastly refused to introduce the worldlier and darker elements of teenage life, like sex and drugs and violence, into the Archie storylines. In doing so they preserved an image of adolescence for the target audience of 7-to-14 year olds. Silberkleit was determined to keep Archie an American institution, pure as childhood, yet up-to-date with the latest technology used by children today. For generations of readers, Archie and the Gang have represented the wonder and magic of childhood and Silberkleit fought successfully to keep this vision alive. Unlike some competitors who use longer formats, Archie Comics continues its tradition of telling accessible, short stories. In one of the many interviews Silberkleit gave, he said, ''The fact that our stories are funny, are non-violent, believable, clean and appropriate for youngsters makes us so appealing to the younger reader. This philosophy hasnt changed for more than 60 years. Many parents grew up reading Archie Comics and feel that our comics are appropriate for their kids.'' After an initial public offering in the early 1970s, when Silberkleit served as Treasurer, Archie Comics shares were traded publicly. But after ten years Silberkleit and his partner Goldwater bought the company back from shareholders and held it as a private, family-owned business thereafter. Currently, the company publishes over 10 million comics per year in a dozen languages worldwide. Born in New York City in 1932, Silberkleit attended the Fieldston School before going to Albright College as an undergraduate. He studied law after his graduation. Silberkleit was also active in the community, volunteering as an auxiliary policeman for the Scarsdale Police force. A resident of Rye and East Hampton, NY, Silberkleit indulged his mechanical aptitude with vintage sports cars, spending several years restoring a 1966 Austin Healey 3000 MKIII. He is survived by his wife, Nancy Lind Silberkleit, and their daughter, Alexandria, and by three adult children from a prior marriage to Karen Silberkleit: Susan Berkley, David Silberkleit and Amy Silberkleit, as well as grandchildren Isis and Elijah Shiffer. A private funeral and memorial service is planned for Sunday, August 10th. The family asks that, in lieu of flowers or other memorials, donations should be made to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Research"

But this weekend more than 300 comedians, stand-ups, improvisers and writers from around the country will participate in 54 continuous hours of funny. It's the 10th annual Del Close Marathon, named for and inspired by the Chicago improv guru who was a mentor to the likes of Tina Fey, John Belushi, Bill Murray, Mike Myers and Amy Poehler. The festival, founded after Mr. Close's death from emphysema in 1999, is run by the Upright Citizens Brigade theater in Chelsea; this year's event has expanded to four additional stages nearby. Starting on Friday at 6 p.m., comedy fans can see round-the-clock improv shows, with appearances by names-you-know-from-television, including Paul Scheer of MTV's ''Human Giant''; Jack McBrayer of ''30 Rock''; Nick Kroll of the late, unlamented ''Cavemen'' sitcom; and cast members and writers from ''The Daily Show,'' ''The Colbert Report,'' ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' and ''Saturday Night Live.'' Even at 3 a.m., there's a line out the door, said Anthony King, the artistic director of the Upright Citizens Brigade, though, ''around noon, you can get in pretty easily.'' (Above, from left, Matt Walsh, Ian Roberts, Ms. Poehler and Matt Besser of the Brigade.)With so many unscripted hours to fill, the organizers are pretty open when it comes to concepts."

Two other places from our experience well worth the journey are Auchendean Lodge (www.auchendean.com) and Old Pines Hotel and Restaurant (www.oldpines.co.uk) .

2008-08-10T00:00:00Z,"Is Afghanistan a Narco-State? Ambassador Thomas Schweich (July 27) just doesn't get it. Afghanistan profits from the opium trade because of prohibition, not in spite of it. Attempts to limit the supply of illegal drugs while demand remains constant increase the profitability of drug trafficking. For addictive drugs like heroin, a spike in street prices leads desperate addicts to increase criminal activity to feed desperate habits. The drug war doesn't fight crime; it fuels crime. Switzerland's heroin maintenance program has reduced disease, death and crime among chronic users. Heroin-maintenance pilot projects are under way in Canada, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. Prescription heroin maintenance could deprive organized crime of a core client base, which might render illegal heroin trafficking unprofitable. It might also undermine Taliban funding in Afghanistan. Of course, admitting that drug prohibition is the problem rather than the solution is tantamount to admitting the emperor wears no clothes."

''We spent a month in Kenya for my school, seeing what different missionary groups are doing, and learning about them. This was my first time leaving Canada, and it was an absolute eye-opener. I'd say most of my ideas of the world were completely changed -- partly by seeing the culture and the way that people live, and also by seeing the way the church is in Kenya. I think the church in North America has so much to learn from the church in Africa. The church in Kenya is so focused on doing good things for the community, doing the good works, whereas the church in North America is so focused on itself. When we had a few days of downtime, we did some tourist things. I'd only seen Canadian wildlife, and most of the zoos where I'm from are very small, so I'd never been exposed to giraffes or elephants or anything like that. So that was really something else.''

Olive, NJ, one of the largest real estate projects in America. He was the founder of the New York Optimist Club and a dedicated New York Rotarian.

But Lowenstein seems to miss the big point: this is no typical crisis. Indeed, the fact that Paulson and Bernanke have taken such steps to avoid disaster speaks to its magnitude. Surely it is unconvincing to hear some investors expressing shock now that the implied government backing of these quasi-government ''agency'' bonds has become explicit. Maybe what they're really reacting to is not that the government should actually save these institutions, but rather that they just can't believe this day has actually come."

I thought it would be strange enough seeing all these homeowners of the abyss, but stranger still was the notion that if I traveled the whole way within 6 feet of the cliff -- or better still on the foreshore -- I would be taking a walk that no one would ever be able to reproduce, because the very land itself would've disappeared within months. I left the train at Bempton and set off for Flamborough Head along roads, because there were no direct paths marked on the map. As ever under these circumstances I feared for my life: in rural England the walker and the driver are pitted against one another, flesh versus steel; and while pedestrians may be a little self-righteous, it's nothing to compare with what I term ''The Divine Right of Cars.'' Still, the fields were full of ripening wheat, the hedgerows with brambles, there were larks in the sky and soon enough I reached the bird reserve at the end of the promontory, turning southwest past the white-painted lighthouse and along the grassy path beside chalk cliffs."

2008-08-10T00:00:00Z,"Rodrigo Corral's working relationship with Chuck Palahniuk began 10 years ago, when he designed Palahniuk's second book, ''Survivor.'' ''I knew 'Fight Club' well and was thrilled to be working on a project on the heels of such a successful book-to-movie,'' Corral said. ''Chuck's writing always has energy and movement, and often reads like a screenplay. It is so filled with dramatic visuals that to illustrate something literally from the stories would undermine the writing and its deeper meaning.'' Corral says he's never literal with his designs, ''because if I were, the covers would look like pulp horror novels.'' The image he devised for Palahniuk's latest novel, ''Snuff,'' covered two aspects of the book: sex and death. ''Real snuff films, as we know, are about death,'' Corral said, ''and there is an attempted-murder mystery in this story, so the girl hanging in the middle is a sign of what could come. (Swallowing a pill is also part of the plot.) As with all of Chuck's books, it's never about just one idea, so the story is not only about sex in the porn industry but about what its characters become. Women in porn become real-life blow-up dolls, and the mouth looks like it belongs to one of them.''"

Preceded in death by his wife of 55 years, Anne Ballentine Williams, Perry is survived by his son David B.

2008-08-10T00:00:00Z,"John Gall, the art director of Vintage Books, began designing covers for Haruki Murakami's novels when Vintage published the paperback version of ''The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.'' ''I was smitten with the design for the original hardcover'' -- by Chip Kidd, who usually does the author's American hardcover jackets -- ''and was hooked on Murakami,'' Gall said. ''There are recurring elements that appear in Murakami's books that I try to use semi-consistently on the covers,'' he added, ''like holes in the ground, running water, disappearing women, etc. I try to figure out new ways to use them each time. So there are lots of cropped women and circle motifs.'' Though Murakami's novels are set in the present, his characters ''can seem as if they're from another time -- hence the use of vintage Japanese art.'' Gall tries not to be too specific: ''The one for 'Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman' is based on Japanese chewing-gum packaging. No real literal context, except that there is a consistent food element to his books.'' Gall's cover for ''After Dark,'' one of whose characters spends the novel in a deep sleep, is a bit more literal."

2008-08-10T00:00:00Z,"Milton Glaser, best known for his ''I New York'' logo, was introduced to Philip Roth by the publisher Peter Mayer 35 years ago in Woodstock, where they all played softball. Roth admired a cover of The Atlantic that Glaser had designed -- an outline of the author's head with hand-drawn letters spelling ''Philip Roth'' in place of his facial features. ''One day he called and asked if I'd do a jacket for him,'' recalled Glaser, who has now designed 10 Roth novels, not counting various British editions. Which should not suggest that the process always goes smoothly. Roth is scrupulous about his covers, and there is always considerable back and forth. ''Much more,'' added Glaser, ''than with every author I've designed for except Nabokov, who sent me a detailed note about what 'Pnin' looked like; I did the cover exactly as he visualized it.'' Glaser rarely uses illustration for Roth's covers. ''The image that may be in someone's mind may exceed the intensity of my image,'' he said. ''Typography is a useful tool for not entering into this dilemma.'' For ''The Plot Against America,'' however, Roth had the notion of using a stamp canceled with a swastika. (''I was just following orders,'' Glaser said.) For ''Exit Ghost,'' Roth first wanted to use a moody photograph of George Plimpton (who figures in the novel) at Elaine's. When the photographer wanted $10,000 for the rights, Roth asked Glaser for a more economical treatment. Recently, Glaser completed yet another type-only jacket for Roth's forthcoming novel, ''Indignation.''"

2008-08-14T00:00:00Z,"Redemption through victory is a bone-headed theme for the United States men’s Olympic basketball team. No country that has always been the best at something needs that kind of deliverance. Certainly, the American team has struggled in recent years: a collapse in the world championship in 2002; a worthless bronze in Athens in 2004 (so shameful that Dwyane Wade doesn’t even know where he put his medal); and a stunning loss to Greece in the 2006 world championship. But have they really morphed into a bunch of losers? Only in the way the Roman army did after its minor defeat at Gergovia -- which is to say hardly at all. If any team other than the ""Redeem Team” tops the podium in Beijing, it’ll be a huge surprise, albeit not the apocalyptic sign it once was. The talent and skill gap between the American team and even its closest competitors -- Spain, Argentina and Greece -- remains considerable (although another spot-up shooter to bust zones would help). Unfortunately, that has not always mattered. The Americans now lug around a record of 95-7 since the pros started playing in 1992. Before you revoke your citizenship, though, consider that three of those losses came in Athens under Larry Brown, who browbeat an inexperienced, patchwork squad."

Mark Warner of Virginia will be the keynote speaker. The keynote is the featured role that Senator Barack Obama was given in 2004, and which propelled him to political stardom. Mr. Warner, who will speak on Aug. 26, is favored to win a Senate seat in Virginia in November. Democratic officials said Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, an abortion opponent, would also address the convention on the same night.

She also leaves bereft dozens of dear friends and family and hundreds of colleagues and clients in disbelief that the life-force that was Cynthia will no longer be there. Cynthia was Founder and President of Vantage Fundraising Counsel. Cynthia had three years of a very good life since a diagnosis of melanoma. Defying the possibility that there might be a difficult or tragic end, she lived her life as she always had. On August 1, she learned of multiple tumor sites. Still she was unbowed. Cynthia died as she had lived, defying the threat. In the process she gave herself years of a happy, active life, unburdening family, friends, employees, col leagues and clients from the fears surrounding the usual efforts to subdue cancer. No tests, no treatments, no surgeries, or agonizing fears would inhibit her mind or heart. Instead, she continued a life-long passion for collecting art, playing tennis, enthusiasm for travel and ardent love of family and friends. She lived her real life in real time. A memorial service will be held at 3pm Thursday August 21 at Brotherhood Synagogue, 28 Gramercy Park South in Manhattan.

Both shows were staggering; each were 30 minutes long with over 5,000 components fired off, all tightly synchronized to custom music beds. This year, I brought my adult son and daughter along for the United States (Wednesday) and China (Saturday) entries; seven other countries competed this year.. Two minutes into the United Statesperformance, my son turned to me and said, “Dad, I’ve just seen more fireworks than I’ve ever seen in my entire life.” He’s 24.

2008-08-17T00:00:00Z,"Bulgari | High Jewelry Necklace What makes this jewel worth $500,000? Partially, it’s the 49 emeralds, three tourmalines and 12 mandarin garnets, plus all the diamonds and 18-karat gold. It’s also the halo of a venerable Italian brand: 125 years old next year, known for instantly identifiable designs that mix precious and semiprecious stones in vibrant color combinations. But ultimately the price tag reflects time. Typically, it takes three to four months to source a grouping of stones. Drafting a design can be another three months, with as many as 60 revisions. Assembly — this piece has 160 different elements — adds at least a month and a half more. And finally there is extreme customer service: should a Tokyo client want to see a few gems while vacationing in Capri, Bulgari will fly some there, along with her usual salesperson from Japan. So factor that in, too. [?][?][?]NATHAN LUMP."

And in what marks a new chapter in fashion re-editing, the designer Sophie Albou of Paris’s Paul & Joe has joined forces with Pierre Cardin. Albou bought a large stash of Cardin couture at auction and fell in love with the futuristic disco style of the clothes. She contacted the reclusive designer and struck a three-year deal to reproduce 10 of his styles per season under the Pierre Cardin for Paul & Joe label. The more fashion changes. ...

Originally written in the 1880s as a catalog featuring filles de joie for visiting johns, the book features elegant pinup illustrations hidden between uncut pages and plenty of colorful, user-friendly descriptions. (One lady of the evening, Georgina Dupont, is described as possessing “a large pair of palpitating hemispheres that are always ready to burst out of her stays.”) Hand-bound in crimson French silk, the petite tome — not to be confused with the more lascivious “Guide des jolies femmes de Paris” recently written by a speechwriter in President Nicolas Sarkozy’s administration — is a love letter to all those forgotten members of the world’s oldest profession.

A longtime fixture on the European fashion scene — he worked for Prada, Fendi, Chanel, Moschino and, most recently, Emanuel Ungaro — Darré jumped easily from dresses to décor. “I wanted to be free to design objects, wallpapers, rugs and furniture with the same freshness I brought to my early work in the fashion world, before it became so business-oriented,” he says. The intimate space, which he conceived of as “more a house than a gallery,” is punctuated by limited-edition pieces that often incorporate backbones, rib cages, femurs and other anatomical elements. “I like to think of it as a chaotic and surrealistic laboratory, close in spirit to the Wiener Werkstätte,” he says. “Every piece is numbered, and my artist friends will collaborate on special pieces for this metaphysical place.” (32, rue du Mont Thabor; 011-33-1-42-60-27-97) [?][?][?]SANDRA BALLENTINE."

Since Cole Haan was a pioneer of the all-American penny loafer, Sheffield had a ready-made inspiration for her multipendant necklaces and handbag charms, made of espresso gold vermeil and whiskey quartz.

2008-08-17T00:00:00Z,"Louise Goldin’s obsessively precise knitwear is literally out of this world. This fall’s show, her second since graduating from Central Saint Martins, envisioned a chance meeting between an Inuit tribe and the crew of the starship Enterprise. Aside from the jagged motifs on short dresses, cat suits and hooded fur-trimmed tops, Goldin threw into the mix sporty drawstrings and soft harnesses; shoulders swollen with padding; fringe and pompoms that dangle from short hemlines; and, to flesh out her models’ hips, wads of cashmere. “It’s all an experiment,” says the 27-year-old London native. When her intersecting squares of ice blue, black and gray splinter and morph into Fair Isle-style patterns on tunic dresses, it’s as if a Cubist painting had been rendered in wool. “The artworks take on their own form, and I never know if they’re going to work — you have to live in the unknown.” Unlike many of her fashion contemporaries, Goldin isn’t the type to party with Hoxton hipsters on the weekend. Instead she shuttles between Gatwick and a factory in northern Italy, supervising every stitch and pushing her (entirely machine-made) knits to a finer, more vibrant complexity: “I want to create new techniques in knitwear so it can look modern.” And her dream clients? “Mary-Kate. Or Madonna,” she says, pointing to a carapace-like black dress with crystal-flecked shoulders. “She’d look fierce in that.” Available at Kirna Zabête in New York. [?][?][?]SUSIE RUSHTON."
2008-08-17T00:00:00Z,"Hats are the most consistent part of my wardrobe — they give me a sense of protection and a reason to get dressed up. This little blue Stephen Jones top hat is my favorite. I discovered Stephen when he graduated from Saint Martins in the late 1970s, and whenever I think, “Mamma mia! I have nothing to wear!” he sends me a sketch. Sometimes I make changes, but it’s usually something very minor, like “Keep in mind that I would like to have a rubber band to hold it on to my head.” What I like most about this hat is its symbolism. The shape represents formality and tradition, but there’s also a bit of irony. It has a veil, which I find flattering and practical, and the color references the blue wave I’ve had in my hair since 1989. I’m thinking of throwing it a 20th-birthday party next year.

On Sept. 27, the Museum of Art and Design reopens in its new home at Two Columbus Circle with a show called “Second Lives: Remixing the Ordinary.” It explores how 51 artists, artisans and designers transform mass-produced, often discarded objects into works of art. Much of the show focuses on clothing, like Susie MacMurray’s “Mixture of Frailties” (2004), a towering wedding dress made out of hundreds of rubber household gloves (above). The art often has a gentle political subtext: Terese Agnew’s “Portrait of a Textile Worker” (2005) is assembled from designer clothing labels.

In recent years, the L.B.D.’s very ubiquity has seen it relegated to the high-fashion margins, dismissed as too safe, too boring — in short, too grown-up.

2008-08-17T00:00:00Z,"KHATAMI--Marie Hoguet passed away on Wednesday, August 13, 2008 from a blood clot following cancer surgery in New York City. Her loving family will miss her profoundly. She was a brave and forward thinking 85-year-old who loved art and European and Asian cultures, a passion she shared with her husband of 57 years, Abul Khatami. We will remember so many things about her, but what stands out in our minds is her incredible spirit, fierce intelligence, and deep resounding laughter. She was as complete a human being as one could be. Marie Khatami was born in Millburn, New Jersey on February 3, 1923. She grew up in Manhattan with her five brothers and two sisters at 47 East 92nd Street. The girls attended Convent of the Sacred Heart; Marie's mother, Louise Hoguet, helped to found the St. David's School in 1951. Marie also attended Sacred Heart in Noroton, CT. and continued her studies in Paris and Siena until the imminent outbreak of World War II brought her home. She attended Barnard and completed her college education at Radcliffe in 1946, where she received a B.A. Her interests in Art History and Asian culture can be traced to the gift of a book from her father, Robert Louis Hoguet, when she was a girl, ''Folktales of Bengal'' by Lal Behari Day. Her parents had traveled to Asia and also traveled with their eight children throughout Europe when she was a child, instilling in her a lifelong love of European and Asian culture. That love compelled her to continue her studies in Chinese Art at the Asia Institute, where she obtained her Masters degree and where she met her husband, Sayyid Abulquasim Khatami, from Isfahan, Iran, who became an anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. It was an art book lent by Marie to Abul that brought them together. They were married on January 9, 1951 and raised their four children in Manhattan. Marie is survived by her husband, Abul, who lives in Manhattan, Marie Norton of Manhattan, Jim Khatami of San Francisco, Renee Khatami of Manhattan, Jessie K. Wallen of Del Mar, California, and proud grandmother of Christopher Khatami, Patrick Norton, Sophie and Emme MacArthur, and Johnnie and Jimmy Wallen, and her sister Eleanor Hoguet de Give of Newburyport, Massa chusetts. A memorial service will be announced. She interred at Most Holy Trinity Church Cemetery in Easthampton, NY."

''Paintings, art, science, reading, movies and traveling are constant sources of inspiration,'' Barbieri says. In ''Dream States'' (Page 230), the couple paid homage to the dark Roman Polanski film ''Repulsion'' (far left). ''There was a lot of black makeup in this season's shows, and the animals also seem to capture the sinister feel of the movie,'' Coppi says. There's nothing dark, however, about the couple's personal life: they live in London with their 4-year-old son, Lorenzo (center), and find beauty in nature and everyday things. They have recently been photographing vintage dresses and broken household objects (above). They source the latter from their own home, and, perhaps in the interest of teamwork, they point to one culprit: ''Nothing is broken intentionally, but it happens that we have quite a few subjects -- especially having Lorenzo around!''"

Jonathan was born and raised in Thibodaux, Louisiana. He attended Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, and received a Master's degree in Theatre from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, Louisiana. He moved to New York City in the autumn of 1996. He joined the Box Office staff at The New Victory Theater in the early days of the ''new'' 42nd Street when shuttered porn shops still lined the street. He then served a brief tenure at the William Morris Agency before becoming Executive Assistant to the President of The Rolfe Company, a Manhattan-based agency representing theatrical designers. A walking encyclopedia of American popular culture, Jonathan founded and served as Editor-in-Chief and Managing Director of www.tvdvdreviews.com, one of the first Web sites dedicated to reviewing television productions released on DVD. The site, which earned a loyal following for its pithy and timely reviews, regularly receives upwards of 3,000 visitors a day. From the time of his diagnosis in February 2005 until his death, Jonathan met his cancer with characteristically fierce stubbornness, irreverent humor, black sarcasm, and an even-keeled, clear head. His tenacity-combined with the unyielding support of friends and family--enabled him to survive countless rounds of chemotherapy, two bone marrow transplants, two brain tumors, and a cord blood transplant. He left his family and friends after affirming on multiple occasions that be couldn't have been happier and more, content with the life he led and the adventures he shared. Jonathan Boudreaux is survived by his longtime partner and companion, Christopher W. Czajka; his parents, Gail C. and Ronnie Boudreaux of Thibodaux; his sister Jenise and brother-inlaw Brian Jennings, also of Thibodaux; his grandparents, Orena and ''Red'' Adams; and countless aunts, uncles, cousins, neighbors, and family friends in Louisiana. He is also survived by scores of friends in New York City and across the country. Particularly steadfast in their support of Jonathan throughout his disease have been his boss and good friend Mickey Rolfe, Nicole Roberts, Kelly Demaret, Marsha Drummond, Kerri Chyka, and Sam Buffer, all of New York; Duane and Barb Czajka and Billie Lape of Rochester, NY; Kay and Eamon Daly and Katie Heilman of Chicago, IL; Allison Dillon of Nashville, TN; Caroline and Colette LaGarde of Raceland, LA; and the staff of the Education Department at Thirteen/WNET. Jonathan will also be remembered and celebrated by a new generation of relatives and friends, including his nephew Draven Michael Jennings and young Norah Elizabeth Czajka and Ian Stuart Lape. At Jonathan's request, no memorial service or funeral will be held. His most ardent wish was for his family and friends to briefly mourn his passing, and then live their lives to their happiest and fullest potential. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the National Marrow Donor Program (www.marrow.org), which provides patients around the world with life-saving bone marrow, cord blood, and stem cell transplants.

Jonathan's three-and-a-half year battle with leukemia was a lesson in grace, dignity, and the complete absence of selfpity --one we'd give anything not to have had to learn this way. We are profoundly indebted to him for his diligence and wisdom. We'll remember him for his gallantry, his unfailing sense of humor, that smile, and his sheer cussedness. So much more than a colleague for nine years, he was like the kid brother I never had. Mickey Rolfe The Rolfe Company, Inc."

''There are in excess of 2,000 stone jars located around the Plain of Jars plateau and surrounding mountains -- some weighing many tons. My fieldwork involved visiting the sites and also some rock outcrops which were thought to be possible quarries for the ancient jars. This photograph is taken at only the second approximately 2,000-year-old quarry I had been to. I thought, how did people 2,000 years ago carve these jars and then transport them three kilometers to the site that we see them today, through this thick jungle? I also wondered if there were any unexploded bombs in the vegetation. One misplaced machete swipe could kill everyone in the party. About an hour after this picture was taken, an unexploded cluster bomb was found in the undergrowth 20 meters away. Another time while I was there, they cleared the land surrounding a jar site so that it could be opened to the public and found 2,000 unexploded bombs, many just below the surface. This was an area on which the children of the village played, and over which the villagers walk to fetch water from the stream numerous times a day.'' As told to to J. R. Romanko"

2008-08-17T00:00:00Z,"ROSENBLATT--Minna, a leading figure among the first generation of antiques dealers responsible for the 1950s revival of Tiffany lamps and French, Austrian and American art glass from the Art Nouveau period died August 2nd at her country home in Walker Valley, New York. A resident of New York City, she was 94 and died of natural causes. A Brooklyn native, born on June 29, 1914, Minna Gootnick graduated from Richmond Hill High School. Lying about her age to secure a job, Miss Gootnick began her career at sixteen as an underage temporary employee of Macy's at Herald's Square during the 1930 Christmas season. She exhibited such an uncanny aptitude as a salesperson that the position quickly became a permanent one. While there Miss Gootnick spent all of her free time on the eighth floor in the Fine Glass and China department, enthralled by the objects on display. Seven years later she left Macy's to marry Saul Levy and raise a family. Mrs. Rosenblatt held a number of jobs during and after World War II to help support her then husband and two young sons. Mr. Levy died in 1947. Her love of antique glass resurfaced with her subsequent marriage one year later to Sidney Rosenblatt, a nationally renowned and award-winning journalist at Parade Magazine. With Sidney's encouragement, she began dealing antiques from the basement of their modest home on Stuart Street in Brooklyn. Most of these pieces were obtained for friends and neighbors and were purchased from local shops, flea markets, and even the Salvation Army. From those humble beginnings came her first storefront on Flatbush Avenue. As collectors recognized her discerning eye, extraordinary expertise, willingness to share her knowledge, and sound advice, the business grew and led to the establishment of a series of galleries on Madison Avenue. Mrs. Rosenblatt, together with Lillian Nassau, Maude Feld, Bea Weiss and Gladys Koch, are largely credited with restoring Louis Comfort Tiffany's artistic and commercial reputation. Arlie Sulka, current owner of Lillian Nassau LLC, recently said of Mrs. Rosenblatt, that she was ''one of the original 'Tiffany Girls' who helped create the market and the interest that exists today.'' Mrs. Rosenblatt's international clientele ran the gamut from leaders of industry to prominent figures in the fields of entertainment and politics, including the likes of Walter P. Chrysler, Jr., David Geffen, and Barbra Streisand. The near 50-year career of Mrs. Rosenblatt culminated in 2003, at which time Christie's auction house held a landmark sale of the remaining art objects from the gallery. A year or two earlier, Fordham University honored her and her husband's philanthropic and academic contributions by re-naming one of its institutions, generously supported by the couple, The Sidney and Minna Rosenblatt Holocaust Library. The facility is considered one of the top 25 libraries of its kind in the world. In addition to Mr. Levy, Minna Rosenblatt is predeceased by her second husband, Sidney Rosenblatt and by her son Joshua. Survivors include her sons George Rosenblatt of Walker Valley, New York and Daniel Rosenblatt of San Carlos, California, her sister Rose Levine of Brooklyn, New York, her brother Seymour Gootnick of Plainview Long Island, six grandchildren and two greatgrandchildren. A memorial service will be announced at a later date."

The view from the station above 125th Street and Broadway can be disorienting: no little shops and bodegas to say, ''This is it.'' What you see instead are warehouses, bus depots and factories, as well as unmarked towers and a crosshatch of diagonal streets more reminiscent of the West Village. Yet there's something slightly magical about the way hills rise up around the area. A recent group exhibition of photographs dedicated to Manhattanville characterized its haunting mix of low-lying back streets, vaulted overpasses, vintage churches and riverfront as ''strange, unresolved or unsettling.'' No wonder few people agree on its future -- or even, for that matter, whether it exists in the first place.

2008-08-17T00:00:00Z,"WOOD--John Meyer, Jr. John Wood, a nationally recognized figure in investment-counseling, died of natural causes at Falmouth by the Sea in Falmouth, Maine. He was 83 years old. Born in New York City to Marion Peters Wood and John M. Wood Sr., he attended the Collegiate School and Harvard University. A member of the Porcelain Club, he enrolled in ROTC and joined the Navy where he served as an officer on the USS Sakatonchee (AOG-19, a Mettawee class gasoline tanker). Though the ship and crew were cited for three battle stars for service in the Pacific, John downplayed their role saying they were often overlooked as a target because the enemy ''didn't want to waste their ammunition.'' After the war, John attended Harvard Business School and graduated at the top of his class. He married Virginia (Chris) Cabot and joined the investment firm of Standish Ayer and McKay as a security analyst. He became a partner in 1952 and in 1965 became President of the firm, moving to Chairman of the board in 1978 wherein the firm's name was changed to Standish Ayer and Wood. He retired in 1989 shuttling between residences in Stowe, VT and Beaufort, SC. In addition to his duties at Standish, John served on numerous Boards including the New England Medical Center, Tufts University and as President of the Investment Council Association. He also participated in local town boards and politics, serving on the Medway Finance Committee and town Republican Party. John is fondly remembered as a strong leader and mentor to his colleagues. ''He always gave us enough rope to make our own mistakes, but never enough to hang ourselves,'' recalls Ted Ladd, current Chairman at Standish. John had a deep love of the sea, especially the Maine coast and Penobscot Bay in particular. As a boy, he summered in Islesboro where his father, ''the Captain'' allowed John and his brother Clayton (Archie) free rein to sail the Bay in a various assortment of boats of questionable seaworthiness. John was also an accomplished woodworker; several of his earlier boats were handcrafted in his barn in Medway, MA. He raced them with passion at the Sherborn, MA Yacht Club on Farm Pond, the location where the family lived for many years after Medway. John is survived by his wife Chris, sister Wendy living in Chaplin, CT, son John (Jay) M. in Falmouth, ME, and daughters, Susan C. of Marion, MA, Dr. Amy P. of Georgetown, ME, Virginia (Whistle) C. of Groton and five grandchildren, Meghan, Christopher, Tory, Courtney, and Max scattered around the globe.

We are profoundly indebted to him for his diligence and wisdom. We'll remember him for his gallantry, his unfailing sense of humor, that smile, and his sheer cussedness. So much more than a colleague for nine years, he was like the kid brother I never had. Mickey Rolfe The Rolfe Company, Inc."

2008-08-19T00:00:00Z,"KHATAMI--Marie Hoguet Passed away on Wednesday, August 13, 2008 from a blood clot following cancer surgery in New York City. Her loving family will miss her profoundly. She was a brave and forward thinking 85-year-old who loved art and European and Asian cultures, a passion she shared with her husband of 57 years, Abul Khatami. We will remember so many things about her, but what stands out in our minds is her incredible spirit, fierce intelligence, and deep resounding laughter. She was as complete a human being as one could be. Marie Khatami was born in Millburn, New Jersey on February 3, 1923. She grew up in Manhattan with her five brothers and two sisters at 47 East 92nd Street. The girls attended Convent of the Sacred Heart; Marie's mother, Louise Hoguet, helped to found the St. David's School in 1951. Marie also attended Sacred Heart in Noroton, CT. and continued her studies in Paris and Siena until the imminent outbreak of World War II brought her home. She attended Barnard and completed her college education at Radcliffe in 1946, where she received a B.A. Her interests in Art History and Asian culture can be traced to the gift of a book from her father, Robert Louis Hoguet, when she was a girl, ''Folktales of Bengal'' by Lal Behari Day. Her parents had traveled to Asia and also traveled with their eight children throughout Europe when she was a child, instilling in her a lifelong love of European and Asian culture. That love compelled her to continue her studies in Chinese Art at the Asia Institute, where she obtained her Masters degree and where she met her husband, Sayyid Abulquasim Khatami, from Isfahan, Iran, who became an anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. It was an art book lent by Marie to Abul that brought them together. They were married on January 9, 1951 and raised their four children in Manhattan. Marie is survived by her husband, Abul, who lives in Manhattan, Marie Norton of Manhattan, Jim Khatami of San Francisco, Renee Khatami of Manhattan, Jessie K. Wallen of Del Mar, California, and proud grandmother of Christopher Khatami, Patrick Norton, Sophie and Emme MacArthur, and Johnnie and Jimmy Wallen, and her sister Eleanor Hoguet de Give of Newburyport, Massa chusetts. A memorial service will be announced. She will be interred at Most Holy Trinity Church Cemetery in Easthampton, NY. Contributions may be made in her memory to the charity of your choice."

2008-08-21T06:00:12Z,"This year more than most, I sense a number of intriguing story lines entering the season-ending Slam. If it hadn't already, the Nadal-Federer rivalry has now joined the ranks of Sampras-Agassi, McEnroe-Borg-Connors, Evert-Navratilova and Seles-Graf. Despite Roger Federer's embarrassing loss to Rafael Nadal at the French Open and the heartbreaker at Wimbledon (where both displayed the mental fortitude of champions, Federer in coming back from what looked to be lights out in the fourth set tiebreaker, and Nadal in sticking to his guns and pulling out a 9-7 fifth set), and even his early exits in Toronto and the Olympics (singles), I have a feeling Federer will keep his end of the bargain for a while longer. He's been shaky of late, but it was encouraging to see how excited he was winning gold in the doubles finals at the Olympics. Perhaps that will translate into the confidence he needs going into the Open. Throw in a young, hungry and still-improving Novak Djokovic, and the plot thickens."

2008-08-21T00:00:00Z,"It’s been quite an Olympics for the hamstrings. They’ve determined the outcome of more events than Michael Phelps’s freakishly long arms. Sanya Richards blamed a “grabbing” hamstring for her loss in the 400 meters; sprinter Tyson Gay’s hamstring pull at the U.S. Olympic Trials reduced him to a non-factor in Beijing; and Chinese hurdler Liu Xiang’s heartbreaking exit from the Games, while directly caused by a sore Achilles tendon, “almost certainly was related” to a severe hamstring injury he suffered a few months back, says Dr. Bryan Heiderscheit, an assistant professor of physical therapy at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and an expert on hamstring injuries. Injured hamstrings, Heiderscheit says, are especially common in sports that involve fast, hard spurts of running, such as the track and field sprints, but also football and soccer. “The million dollar question is why,” he says. Despite reams of research, there’s no answer. What is known, though, is that a hamstring injury is self-perpetuating. An athlete who’s suffered one is at an enormously increased risk of another. Again, researchers don’t know why that is, although a new study by Heiderscheit and his colleagues is suggestive. In the work, 11 athletes hobbled by hamstrings underwent a M.R.I. examination. In all but two of them, the hamstrings showed “substantial changes in the tissue,” even a year and a half after the injury, Heiderscheit says. Some sections of tissue were enlarged and scarred; others atrophied. The whole was, in effect, remodeled. How that metamorphosis contributes to later injury and, more important, how to use the M.R.I. findings to avoid re-injury “will require a lot more study,” Heiderscheit says."

Meanwhile, the judiciary summoned two prominent actors, Parviz Parastui and Ezzatolah Entezami, and a movie director, Kiumars Poorahmad, for trying to collect money to help save the life of Behnood Shojaee, who is on death row for a murder he committed when he was 17. The three said the victim's family had agreed to allow him to be spared in return for a generous amount of money, called blood money under Iran's law. But a judiciary official told the news agency ISNA that relatives of the victim filed a complaint, denying that they had agreed to forgive the murder. NAZILA FATHI"

Part of the appeal of the Wertheimer brothers is that they're so private. I see Alain Wertheimer from time to time up at Chanel-usually after most of the editors have cleared out of Karl's studio-and you can ask him almost anything, except about Chanel. Horses, no problem. But he doesn't discuss Chanel and of course he doesn't discuss Lagerfeld. I'm glad I've had a window into this rare owner/designer relationship, and I really prefer not to think of the fashion world without Lagerfeld. It won't be the same when he decides to call it a day-not as fun, not as intelligent, not as historic-minded. In an era of multibrands and luxury conglomerates, just think what this one family has done to preserve not merely a business but also a way of working. Chanel is a unique culture, and I suspect it's helped the perspective of the Wertheimers that their reference/compass points are France, England and New York, where they mainly live."

Through a life well lived, Larry upheld his family's generations-long tradition of service and philanthropy. He gave of himself to numerous organizations, including the New Orleans Tourist and Convention Commission, Audubon Park Commission and the Port of New Orleans. In April of this year, Larry received the prestigious Judah Touro Society Award in recognition of 18 years of guidance as a member and past chair of the board of Touro Infirmary. Larry's devotion to his alma mater was as strong as his unstoppable enthusiasm for its student-athletes. As a member of the Tulane board, he was instrumental in restructuring the Tulane athletics program at a crucial point in the late nineties, and his support later helped to carry the Green Wave through the difficult post-Katrina period. He gave his time freely, serving most recently as chair of the Board's Endowment Management Committee, where his expertise and financial acumen were invaluable to the academic and financial growth of the university.

Our Mother, grandmother, aunt and dear friend, Julie Follansbee Pratt Shattuck, who found pure joy in nature, food, language, art, and friendship died August 16th at the age of 88. An actress, she was the youngest of five children, certainly the most Bohemian, and always championed the underdog, in her heart and in her life, perhaps because she felt she was one. Although Julie was a master gardener, an accomplished French cook-worshipped all things French--who served food as if it were love itself, a world traveler, a Thespian from Brecht and ''The Gin Game'' to ''Regarding Henry'' and ''Law and Order,'' was adored by two husbands, the photographer, Charles Pratt and International Attorney, Francis Shattuck, she never quite fathomed how powerfully she affected those around her. Julie read everything from Marcel Proust to Bill Maxwell, who was her dear friend and on whose birthday she died, ever loyal. She was as disarmingly hilarious as she was generous to her friends and family. We will miss her passion for peonies and her apple tree, for smelly cheese, for a rare bottle of wine, for the Democrats, for the pitch perfect dramatic moment. She is survived by her only child, Mike Pratt, her ''one miracle,'' and his wife, Carol, her grandchildren, Julian and Sam Pratt, stepchildren, John Shattuck and Tina Stenhaus and the many devoted friends and family who will hold her enchanting, irreverent presence close to them, always."

By 1999 Mr. Haysbert was a doctor in the CBS series ''Now and Again,'' advising a man whose brain had been implanted in a bio-engineered body. He was elected to the United States Senate in 2001, in time for the first season of the Fox series ''24,'' and by Season 2 he was President David Palmer."

Her daughter, Helen, was there to bid her adieu and bon voyage. For forty years, Christel worked for the Pieper Travel Bureau in Buffalo, NY. She was a travel agent extraordinaire, being one of the top twenty-five agents in the United States. While creating unique travel adventures for individuals and groups such as the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, she traveled the world visiting far away places like the Galapagos Islands, Vietnam and China. On her second visit to China in 1981, she attended the opening of the Grand Canal to western tourists for the first time since the revolution in 1948. Her home is lovingly filled with artwork and mementos of her worldwide travels across five continents. Christel had a lifelong passion for politics and foreign affairs. A native of Germany, Christel became an American citizen in 1973 so that she could participate in our electoral process. Upon retiring to Watkins Glen, she immersed herself in the activities of the League of Women Voters of Schuyler County, serving on the Board for a number of years. An avid reader with an insatiable quest for knowledge, Christel supported or volunteered for many local organizations; Friends of the Watkins Glen Library, the Schuyler County Historical Society, ARC, and the Schuyler Hospital Auxiliary, to name a few. Per her wishes, memorial services will be private. Those wishing to remember Christel are encouraged to do so with a memorial gift to the Watkins Glen Public Library which will be matched by her family."

One of them -- it's not clear which -- grew up to be the manipulative pill-popper Neely O'Hara in the 1967 film ''Valley of the Dolls,'' but the other went straighter: she spent time as a nun, in the 1983 TV film ''September Gun,'' then the next year found herself as the first first lady, Martha Washington, in a TV mini-series about George. A year after that she was President Julia Mansfield in the ABC series ''Hail to the Chief.'' The country, alas, was not ready for a female president; the show was canceled after a few months.

2008-08-24T00:00:00Z,"A year ago, Yale running back Mike McLeod was the Ivy League player of the year and its only all-American. In a 10-game season, he rushed for 1,619 yards and 23 touchdowns. He played the last five games with a broken right big toe that prevented him from planting and cutting. This year, as a senior, he could be even better. ''I think I will be, because we're bringing in a passing game,'' McLeod said in a telephone interview. ''We're used to seeing eight or nine men in the box, but I don't think we'll see that again.'' The defenses that crowded the line of scrimmage were designed to stop McLeod, a 5-foot-11, 205-pound tailback from New Britain, Conn. He usually foiled them. ''I feel I can see the field better than most people,'' he said. ''I'm not the biggest guy, but I can still bring it up the middle on third-and-short, and I can bust big runs. I think I'm an elusive back who runs angry with deceptive power.'' This season, McLeod hopes to be more involved in a short passing game and return some kickoffs. His future goal is to play pro football. ''If not,'' he said, ''then the financial world. Hopefully, the economy will improve by the time I graduate. Otherwise, maybe law school.'' But first things first. ''It should be the best we've had in four years,'' he said. ''We're a lot stronger, a lot more dedicated, and people who didn't give it their all are all gone.'' In this year's preseason news media survey, Yale and Harvard finished in a tie for league champion. A look at all of the teams, in order of predicted finish: YALE (2007 record: 9-1, 6-1) A decade ago, the Elis threw 45 or 50 times a game. Now they run, because of Mike McLeod, one of 35 seniors on the team. Jack Siedlecki, entering his 12th season as Yale's head coach, calls him the best short-yardage runner he has coached and probably the quickest 10-yard runner he has coached. ''He doesn't try to juke you,'' Siedlecki said. ''It's just one move and go.'' But for McLeod to be most effective, the offense must improve play-action calls to keep defenses guessing. PLAYERS TO WATCH TB Mike McLeod, LB Bobby Abare, OT Darius Dale, DE Brady Hart, FS Steve Santoro, C Ty Davis, P Tom Mante. HARVARD (8-2, 7-0) Last year, the Crimson had the league's best total defense (274.6 yards a game) and rushing defense (77.5), and that unit should be strong again. So should the front seven for an offense that averaged 407.7 yards a game last season. Chris Pizzotti is 11-1 as the starting quarterback and does not make mistakes. He threw only four interceptions last year. ''We have a chance to be good,'' Coach Tim Murphy said, ''but we're concerned about depth and the secondary.'' PLAYERS TO WATCH OT James Williams, DT Matt Curtis, LB Glenn Dorris, CB Andrew Berry, TB Cheng Ho, DE Peter Ajayi, LB Eric Schultz. BROWN (5-5, 4-3) The Bruins' offense last year averaged 424 yards and 32.1 points a game, the best in the league, and this year's team could do the same. Michael Dougherty, in his first year as starting quarterback, passed for 3,039 yards and 19 touchdowns. Jim Develin, an excellent pass rusher, leads the defense. As Coach Phil Estes said, ''We have experience, we're a lot better, and we have a chance to contend.'' PLAYERS TO WATCH WR Buddy Farnham, WR Bobby Sewall, TE Colin Cloherty, OT Paul Jasinowski, QB Michael Dougherty, DE Jim Develin. PENNSYLVANIA (4-6, 3-4) The defense can be good, especially with its strong cornerbacks. The offensive line is inexperienced. The big question mark is at quarterback, where Robert Irvin starts after missing his freshman season and most of his junior season with an injured passing shoulder. As a sophomore, he passed for 2,128 yards. He's big and smart and has a strong arm, and if he does well, Coach Al Bagnoli said, ''We have a chance to be pretty good.'' PLAYERS TO WATCH S Chris Wynn, LB Jay Colabella, OT Chris Kovalcik, CB Tyson Maugle, TB Michael DiMaggio. PRINCETON (4-6, 3-4) The offensive line has four players who have started since their freshman seasons. Brian Anderson, the senior quarterback, has started only one game, last year's finale (he won). Coach Roger Hughes's assessment: ''I like this team a lot -- chemistry, work ethic, unselfishness -- but I don't know how many games we're going to win.'' PLAYERS TO WATCH P Ryan Coyle, DE Pete Buchignani, QB Brian Anderson, DE Tom Methvin, DT Matt Koch. CORNELL (5-5, 2-5) This is Nate Ford's third year as the starting quarterback, and because of injuries he has yet to finish a season. The offensive and defensive lines were pushed around last year and must improve physically. But there are 33 seniors from Coach Jim Knowles's first recruiting class. ''No more excuses,'' he said. PLAYERS TO WATCH QB Nate Ford, OT Steve Valenta, S Tim Bax, WR Zac Canty, LB Graham Rihn. DARTMOUTH (3-7, 3-4) Coach Buddy Teevens said his team would be much improved and more competitive. He cited ''more depth, more team speed, more pressure from the defensive line.'' He also said athleticism would make up for inexperience. He plans to use two quarterbacks: the junior Alex Jenny and the sophomore Tim McManus, who started at wide receiver last year. PLAYERS TO WATCH LB Andrew Dete, OT Alex Rapp, TB Milan Williams, DE Charles Bay, S Ian Wilson. COLUMBIA (1-9, 0-7) The Lions need to improve everywhere, starting with better blocking and better defense up front against the run. They must also choose a starting quarterback from a group of three: the juniors M. A. Olawale and Shane Kelly and the sophomore Paul Havas. Still, Coach Norries Wilson said, ''We have a chance to have a decent team.'' PLAYERS TO WATCH WR Austin Knowlin, LB Alex Gross, P/K Jon Rochell, DE Phillip Mitchell, OT Mike Brune."

2008-08-24T00:00:00Z,"WETZEL--Harry Herman, Jr. January 27, 1920--August 14, 2008. Aviation pioneer Harry Herman Wetzel Jr. died on August 14, of complications of old age. He was 88. Harry made important contributions to aerospace, to the wine business, and to his community and the arts. He will be remembered as an engineer's engineer with an extraordinary memory and powerful intellect, coupled with boundless curiosity, impeccable courtesy, and an impish sense of humor. Born on January 27, 1920 in Howard, PA, Harry was the only child of Maude T. and Harry H. Wetzel. His father, a vice president at the Douglas Aircraft company, played a key role in the development and manufacture of the DC3. Harry graduated from Cornell University in 1941 with a bachelors degree in engineering. He then joined the Army Air Force, where he served as an experimental test pilot. In 1945, he married Margaret Kirkpatrick of Hampton, Virginia. They moved to California and in 1946 he joined the Garrett Corporation, a supplier to the burgeoning aerospace industry, as a laboratory technician. In 1963, Harry became president of Garrett and he held the position of CEO when he retired in 1985. Under his leadership, Garrett became the world's largest producer of aircraft auxiliary power units as well as truck and car turbochargers. Harry also initiated the development of a new and very efficient aircraft fanjet engine, which enabled business jets to make the coast-to-coast trip non-stop. Harry was often referred to as ''A man with a plan for a fan.'' In 1962, the Wetzels purchased a piece of land in California's Alexander Valley, on the site of Cyrus Alexander's original homestead. In 1975, they established Alexander Valley Vineyards winery, which, guided by their son Hank, produces premium varietal wines to this day. Harry loved to travel, and up until his death he continued to plan family trips. He was also an excellent cabinetmaker and many members of his family have beautiful pieces of furniture that he made. An avid fisherman and hunter, he was a crack shot with a pistol, rifle and shotgun. He did the New York Times crossword puzzle every day. On the cultural side, he served as chairman of the board of the Los Angeles Performing Arts Council Music Center; as a Trustee of the Donald Douglas Museum and Library; and as a board member of the California Institute of Technology. Beneficiaries of his time and philanthropy also include the Santa Rosa Symphony and the Wetzel Emergency Department at Healdsburg Hospital. He is survived by his children Sally Fallon Morell, Hank Wetzel, Katie Wetzel Murphy, and John Wetzel; his thirteen grandchildren and their spouses; and his three great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 11:00am on Tuesday, August 26 at Alexander Valley Vineyards, 8640 Highway 128, Healdsburg, CA."

He did owe his supporters an apology for having led them into a venture that would necessarily have exploded, disastrously, had the adultery revelations surfaced in the general election campaign. But besides this narrow and deserving audience, the only person for whom John Edwards ''had'' to make his confession was John Edwards. It was a necessary, preliminary step on the road to redemption, the beginning of the dance of sin and sorriness that may, eventually, pave the way up from his current depths of shame to new heights of wiser, smarter, deeper, public service. He made no secret of this. ''I don't think anything's ended,'' he told Bob Woodruff. ''My Lord and my wife have forgiven me. So I'm going to move on.'' This particular round of re-branding doesn't much seem to have worked, judging by how ''unsatisfying'' reviewers have judged Edwards's ''Nightline'' performance to have been. But I have no doubt that, in the future, he'll be back -- with a few well-planned wrinkles, a few grizzled hairs to connote wisdom and suffering, and, most important, a more personal and immediate relationship with God.

BEHIND THE NEWS The collapse of the building, almost seven hours after the neighboring Twin Towers, has been Exhibit A for theorists who say the terror attacks were an ''inside job'' or for those who fault the city for putting its crisis headquarters there, including large diesel fuel tanks for emergency power. The investigators said the mystery was over, and that the heat of fires left unfought for lack of water fully accounted for the building's collapse."

Both Etro and Chloé have buckled variations for fall, and Sigerson Morrison's sold out at a trunk show months before they were due to hit stores.

For him, the slumping economy would have spelled the end of the micro-mini, and, to a certain extent, that's just what happened. Though short skirts still live, a slew of forward-thinking designers, including Marc Jacobs, Marios Schwab and Junya Watanabe showed strikingly new long-and-lean looks for fall. And Kate Moss, Nicole Richie and both Olsens have taken to wearing them. Of course there are holes in the theory: The Los Angeles designer Jenni Kayne has been showing sinuous floor-length skirts for several seasons now. ''I just think they're so chic,'' she said. ''It's such an effortless way to dress up without looking over the top.'' She does note, however, that it was only this fall that store buyers took a keen interest in them.

Nina Trutanic died on August 19 after suffering a stroke while obtaining care at a medical facility in Maryland, according to her son, Richard Trutanic. Born on November 4, 1917, in the Los Angeles port community of San Pedro, Nina Trutanic was one of seven children and the last surviving child of Antoinette Simic and Martin J. Bogdanovich, a Croatian immigrant, and the founder and Chief Executive of StarKist Foods until his death. Nina served on the company's board of directors, along with her siblings, including Joseph Bogdanovich, who succeeded Martin as the Chief Executive and served in that capacity for many years after it was acquired by HJ Heinz & Company. StarKist was later sold to Del Monte Foods and Dongwon Enterprises. Nina Trutanic was married to Nicholas F. Trutanic, a leading tuna industry executive, who worked in senior international management capacities for StarKist, for over thirty years, and died aboard a Star Kist vessel in New Zealand. Nina, along with her husband, lived and traveled in various countries around the word, including Europe, South America, Asia and Africa, as the company's operations expanded and StarKist became a leading global company. Nina Trutanic grew up in San Pedro, CA and graduated from Mills College, where she studied language and music. Fluent in four languages, Nina was an ardent lover of music who studied opera and performed at various venues. She was a founder of the Los Angeles Music Center and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and active in several other philanthropic arts and educational fields thoughout her lifetime. Nina was also a personal friend of President Richard M. Nixon, his wife Pat and family.

His zest for life and never-ending quest for knowledge were evident to all who knew him.

2008-08-24T00:00:00Z,"KHATAMI--Marie Hoguet Passed away on Wednesday, August 13, 2008 from a blood clot following cancer surgery in New York City. Her loving family will miss her profoundly. She was a brave and forward thinking 85-year-old who loved art and European and Asian cultures, a passion she shared with her husband of 57 years, Abul Khatami. We will remember so many things about her, but what stands out in our minds is her incredible spirit, fierce intelligence, and deep resounding laughter. She was as complete a human being as one could be. Marie Khatami was born in Millburn, New Jersey on February 3, 1923. She grew up in Manhattan with her five brothers and two sisters at 47 East 92nd Street. The girls attended Convent of the Sacred Heart; Marie's mother, Louise Hoguet, helped to found the St. David's School in 1951. Marie also attended Sacred Heart in Noroton, CT. and continued her studies in Paris and Siena until the imminent outbreak of World War II brought her home. She attended Barnard and completed her college education at Radcliffe in 1946, where she received a B.A. Her interests in Art History and Asian culture can be traced to the gift of a book from her father, Robert Louis Hoguet, when she was a girl, ''Folktales of Bengal'' by Lal Behari Day. Her parents had traveled to Asia and also traveled with their eight children throughout Europe when she was a child, instilling in her a lifelong love of European and Asian culture. That love compelled her to continue her studies in Chinese Art at the Asia Institute, where she obtained her Masters degree and where she met her husband, Sayyid Abulquasim Khatami, from Isfahan, Iran, who became an anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. It was an art book lent by Marie to Abul that brought them together. They were married on January 9, 1951 and raised their four children in Manhattan. Marie is survived by her husband, Abul, who lives in Manhattan, Marie Norton of Manhattan, Jim Khatami of San Francisco, Renee Khatami of Manhattan, Jessie K. Wallen of Del Mar, California, and proud grandmother of Christopher Khatami, Patrick Norton, Sophie and Emme MacArthur, and Johnnie and Jimmy Wallen, and her sister Eleanor Hoguet de Give of Newburyport, Massa chusetts.

The Pasarows established the Foundation over twenty years ago to celebrate extraordinary achievement, creativity, and distinction in research in three areas of medicine: cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neuropsychiatry. The late Robert Pasarow started a business in which Claire actively participated; she was also a gifted sculptor and artist. Their shared enthusiasm, passion, and enjoyment in learning the stories of the work of the medical researchers who received the Pasarow Awards were deeply appreciated. After the death of Robert, Claire continued as the inspirational source for the work of the Foundation. Claire Pasarow's spirit and love of creative effort was a joy to all of us who knew her."

A long time superb golfer he was a regular member of our foursome and we spent many informative and blissful hours with him. Larry, or ''Awrence'' as we referred to him, was the rare individual who knew both royalty and the ordinary man, but who never lost the common touch. He was equally comfortable with both as they were with him. Awrence had many significant philanthropic interests and he made a positive impact on all that he touched. In addition to his recognized skill in the commodities industry, having fun was his mantra. Besides golf he loved horse racing, fishing and wagering on, as he said, ''anything that moved.'' All was always in good taste and made everyone around him happier and with a true belief that they were lucky to know him. He lived his life breaking par every day. He is irreplaceable.

2008-08-25T00:00:00Z,"RAFAEL NADAL'S DRAWAt the top, if play goes according to seeds, No. 1 Nadal would face No. 7 David Nalbandian in the quarterfinals, but that seems unlikely. Nalbandian could be defeated in the second round by Juan Carlos Ferrero, who thumped him in the third round of this year's Australian Open. In fact, Nalbandian, 26, has not made it past the fourth round of a major since 2006. Ninth-ranked James Blake, a fan favorite at the Open, may have more confidence against Nadal, whom he handled before Nadal's monster 2008. But Blake's supporters should dread the prospects of Nalbandian against Blake in the Round of 16 in a fifth set, in which Nalbandian is excellent but Blake has had little success. One anticipated first-round match is between tall big servers, Tomas Berdych and Sam Querrey. It may be quick, even if five sets. DAVID FERRER'S DRAWNo. 4 Ferrer and No. 6 Andy Murray, who was a semifinalist in Toronto and the winner in Cincinnati this summer, are the strongest players in this quarter. But No. 10 Stanislas Wawrinka could assert himself. He won Olympic gold with Roger Federer in doubles, and with it, a lift in confidence. Wawrinka, who reached the Open's fourth round last year, could use a break at a major: in 2008, he retired in the fourth set in the second round in Melbourne, squandered a two-setsto- love lead against Fernando González in the third round in Paris and lost to Marat Safin in Wimbledon's fourth round. No. 17 Juan Martin del Potro, who has won 19 straight matches since June 25, could be motivated or exhausted after winning two hardcourt events while the stars competed in Beijing."

Over two strong albums he has been a charismatic and sometimes mischievous rapper, but the question remains: Is the Game more than the sum of his proper nouns?"

She was born in Shanxi Province, China on September 19, 1915 and her home was Shanghai. She was a member of the K'ung family and a 75th generation lincal descendent of Confucius. Her father, Dr. H.H. K'ung, was a wealthy industrialist and banker who later became the Premier and Minister of Finance of Shina. Her mother, Ai-Ling Soong K'ung, was one of the 3 famous Soong sisters. Her aunt, Mayling Soong, marries Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek, who led the Chinese against the Japanese during WWII and later against the Communist regime. Her aunt, ChingLing Soong married Dr. Sun Yat-Sen who formed the Kuomintang Party and established the Nationalist Government of China after the end of the Manchu Dynasty. Her uncle, Dr. T.V. Soong was also Premier and Minister of Finance at one point. Her deep Christian faith came from childhood, as her grandfather Charles Soong had come to the U.S. and had been educated and converted to Christianity. He printed bibles in China and spread the word of God. She moved to New York in 1948 and married Col. Hsiung Sheng Hwang in 1962 and had forty four years of blissful marriage until her husband's passing in 2006. She devoted her life to family and others. She ministered to her mother and father and to Madame Chiang Kai-shek until their deaths. She was a faithful and loyal servant of God. Rosamonde Hwang is survived by her nephew Gregory K'ung and her sister-in-law Debra K'ung who love her and will miss her greatly, as will many other of her extended family and friends. A viewing for family and friends will be held at the Frank Campbell Funeral Home at 81st and Madison on Tuesday 9:30 to 11:30am. Funeral service 1:00pm at the Ferncliff Cemetery."

2008-08-25T00:00:00Z,"ANA IVANOVIC'S DRAWTop-seeded Ivanovic vs. No. 6 Dinara Safina would be a prime-time quarterfinal (and French Open final rematch). But Ivanovic, who pulled out of the Olympics with a thumb injury, is facing several obstacles, including fatigue and Amélie Mauresmo, barely seeded at 32nd. Mauresmo, whose drastic fall since an appendectomy in March 2007 almost led to her retirement, reached the semifinals at the Pilot Pen in New Haven last week. Mauresmo is one of eight Frenchwomen in this section of the draw, including her first-round opponent, Nathalie Dechy, No. 17 Alize Cornet and No. 31 Virginie Razzano. Even if Ivanovic regains some emotional and physical energy, few would be shocked if she lost to Safina, who this summer has won two hardcourt events and a silver medal in singles at the Olympics. SERENA WILLIAMS'S DRAWSure, Kateryna and Alona Bondarenko could face each other in this quarterfinal, but the more famous sisters are expected to meet, No. 4 Serena Williams vs. No. 7 Venus, pictured below. The Bondarenkos took the first set off the Williamses in the doubles semifinal at the Olympics and won the Australian Open doubles title. Alas, this is singles. Alona, seeded 27th and coming off a knee injury, could face Venus in the third round. Her younger sister Kateryna opens against Serena. Agnieszka Radwanska, whose younger sister Urszula is a junior champion, is seeded No. 9 and could face Venus in the Round of 16. Last year, the older Radwanska upset Maria Sharapova, who is missing this year's Open because of a shoulder injury. Also watch out for No. 18 Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia, who upset Jelena Jankovic in Montreal earlier this month."
