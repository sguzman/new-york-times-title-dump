2011-10-05T00:00:00Z,"Any taxi-riding, bodega-shopping, laundromat-using New Yorker knows that immigrants own many of the businesses that make New York tick. Now a new study shows that while immigrants constitute just over a third of the city's population, they make up nearly half of the city's small-business owners. The study, published Monday by the Fiscal Policy Institute and based on census data, found that more than 69,000 New York City business owners - about 48 percent of the total - are foreign born. These immigrant entrepreneurs hail from around the world and run companies in every sector of the economy. But in certain lines of business, including dry cleaning, taxi services and grocery stores, the study shows that immigrant owners dominate."

2011-10-05T00:00:00Z,"1:15 P.M. (IFC) CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER (2006) A cruel emperor (Chow Yun-Fat) and his secretive wife (Gong Li, above with Mr. Chow) plot each other's annihilation: he, by destroying her sanity with a rare fungus; she, by planning a bloody coup during a festival and persuading one of her three sons (Jay Chou) to join her revolt. Writing in The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis said that this martial arts drama from the Chinese director Zhang Yimou, set in A.D. 928, ''achieves a kind of operatic delirium, opening the floodgates of image and melodrama until the line between tragedy and black comedy is all but erased.'' She added: ''Since his debut in 1987 with 'Red Sorghum' Mr. Zhang has made more controlled films but never one that's more fun. With 'Curse of the Golden Flower' he aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann. And a good thing too.'' 6 A.M. (Oxygen) A WALK ON THE MOON (1999) Diane Lane plays Pearl Kantrowitz, a housewife who each summer totes her ironing board, children and mother-in-law to a camp in the Catskills while her husband, Marty (Liev Schreiber), stays in New York City, repairing television sets. Viggo Mortensen is the hippie salesman who turns her life upside down in 1969, as the moon walk and Woodstock loom. Writing in The Times about this romance from Tony Goldwyn, Janet Maslin said, ''Even when it turns turbulent, the film sustains its warm summer glow, and makes itself a conversation piece about the moral issues it means to raise.''"

Born in Elkhart, Indiana on January 1, 1924, he attended DePauw University before joining the US Army in 1943. He was recruited into the OSS and went to China in 1945, assigned to the Eagle Project for Korean independence. In 1946, he returned to the University of Chicago, where he later obtained his PhD under Hans Morgenthau. He joined the CIA in 1949, assigned to Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Indonesia. He served as Cambodia station chief from 1960-62 and as Deputy Chief of the Far East Division 1963-1965. Upon his resignation from the CIA, he was awarded the Intelligence Medal. He was co-founder and publisher of The Washingtonian magazine in 1965. From 1968 through 1979, he was publisher of The New Republic. While in DC, he enjoyed writing fiction and political satire. From 1980-1994, he was president of the Carnegie Council for Ethics and International Affairs in New York. During his tenure, the Council developed dynamic programs examining questions of human rights, ethics and moral philosophy in partnership with diverse institutions throughout the world. Upon retirement, he and his wife Betty moved to California, where he was a fellow at the Hoover Institution from 1995-2007, completing two books; U.S. Policy in the 21st Century: The Relevance of Realism (1999) and Korea in the Cross Currents: A Century of Struggle and the Crisis of Reunification (2001). He enjoyed tennis and golf, was a White Sox fan and a jazz aficionado. Family, friends and colleagues benefited from his encouragement and ability to connect people through his wide-ranging interests and creativity. We will miss his wit and humor and incisive analyses. He was preceded in death by his wife, Elizabeth Watson Myers, in 1998, and a son, Timothy John Myers, in 2003. He is survived by his daughters, Holly Myers, of Portola Valley, CA and Lauchlin Myers, of Berkeley; his sons in law, Kirk Neely and Mark Liebman; and seven grandchildren."

It was unusual, because its author was not Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who has made the S.E.C. a regular recipient of his wrath. Judge William H. Pauley III criticized the agency for failing to keep an eye on a private firm that it hired to dole out $25 million in settlement funds to investors in Zurich Financial Services. The judge took the S.E.C. to task for its ''unseemly'' oversight of the Garden City Group, which sought to collect its own steep $1 million fee. ''The question that occurs to this court, but apparently not to the S.E.C., is, was such an expensive notice program effective?'' Judge Pauley wrote."

Perhaps more surprising were the study's findings on the gaps between genres. The authors of the study, Dawn R. Hobbs and Gordon G. Gallup Jr., found a large difference between the ''reproductive messages'' embedded in country music and those found in pop and R&B.

Slightly more than a quarter of participants predicted the show would survive the season, and 12.3 percent of the participating readers correctly guessed that it would make it just three episodes. The only hourlong drama with poorer prospects than ''Playboy Club,'' according to readers, was ''Charlie's Angels.'' Only 5 percent of players had that ABC drama in their virtual prime-time lineups and 24.7 percent of the players thought the Angels would survive at least eight episodes."

2011-10-06T00:00:00Z,"In a display of moxie worthy of Fanny Brice herself, the producers of the coming Los Angeles revival of ''Funny Girl'' said on Wednesday they would transfer that musical to the Imperial Theater on Broadway next April -- even though the show has yet to begin rehearsals. Ever since the producers disclosed in June 2010 that Bartlett Sher, a Tony Award winner for ''South Pacific,'' would direct a major revival of ''Funny Girl,'' Broadway theater owners and executives assumed that the show would eventually come their way - if Mr. Sher could first make it work out of town. That is no sure thing: ''Funny Girl'' has not been seen on Broadway in almost 50 years in part because of concerns that no actress could live up to Barbra Streisand, who played Fanny in the original 1964 production and won an Academy Award for best actress in 1969 for the film version. The producers announced in August that Lauren Ambrose, best known as Claire Fisher on the HBO series ''Six Feet Under,'' would play Fanny; the production will mark her Broadway debut in a musical."

What if your boy is marrying a boy, or your girl is marrying a girl? Last Saturday, gay-friendly lyrics to ''Sunrise, Sunset,'' written by Sheldon Harnick, the ''Fiddler on the Roof'' lyricist, were sung at the nuptials of Richard Skipper and Daniel Sherman, in Tappan, N.Y.

Upon learning that her daughter was being bullied, Julie Deane, in Cambridge, England, set out to earn the money to send her children to private school. Reading the Harry Potter books with her family, she drew upon the bags that Harry and friends carried at Hogwarts. She made samples, bloggers got wind, and now she has a multimillion-dollar business, and starlets, like the enchanting Elle Fanning (right), toting her bags. They are available at cambridgesatchel.com, with custom embossing, if you like, and come November they will be at Bloomingdale's. P.S.: The kids are in private school."

(Showtime) VALENTINO: THE LAST EMPEROR (2009) Matt Tyrnauer chronicles the life and times of the Italian designer Valentino Garavani, above, and the end of an era of haute couture. The film explores his fantasy vision for some of the world's most glamorous women (including Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis), his longtime romantic and business relationship with Giancarlo Giammetti, and his official retirement in 2007. The film offers ''only the sketchiest biography'' and few glimpses of his ''notoriously imperial lifestyle,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. Still, ''watching the movie is a little like gorging on chocolate and Champagne until that queasy moment arrives when you realize you've consumed far too much.'' In ''Vidal Sassoon: The Movie'' (2011), at 7:30, Craig Teper examines the career of Mr. Sassoon, whose wash-and-wear philosophy changed the world of hairstyling. An ''extravagant verbal fusillade introduces a screen biography that sometimes feels like an infomercial,'' Mr. Holden wrote. Yes, ''it is all too much,'' he added. ''But in the documentary's defense, its upbeat tone, perky visual rhythm and sleek graphics capture the 'swinging '60s' aesthetic epitomized by Mr. Sassoon's major invention: the geometric 'five-point' haircut.'' 6 A.M.

Strictly out of curiosity (and not masochism, as some of you are no doubt thinking), I asked the 15-year-old if she could tell me what the object on her T-shirt was, and thoroughly enjoyed the fact that she could not. The closest she could get, being only 15, was that the picture on her shirt was ""neat."" To her credit, she knew that a turntable was something on which her Dad used to play records.

While Mr. Daisey said he did not yet know exactly what he would say, he said he planned to deal with ''the culture of deification and the realities of nostalgia, as well as the fact that people have been expressing such tenderness and affection for this human being because of their connection to his devices.'' The production, directed by Jean-Michele Gregory, Mr. Daisey's wife, is scheduled to run through Nov. 13."

2011-10-07T00:00:00Z,"It's generally not a good sign when anyone in a horror movie wields a sharp instrument, but by taking some editing scissors to his film ''The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),'' the director Tom Six has secured the right to show it in Britain as the British Board of Film Classification lifted its ban on the film. In June that board, the British equivalent to the Motion Picture Association of America, said that it would give no rating at all to ''The Human Centipede 2,'' Mr. Six's second entry in a series of shock films about madmen who kidnap people and sew them together from one end to the other. Explaining its decision at the time, which prevented the movie from being legally sold or shown in Britain, the board said the film was ''sexually violent,'' ''potentially obscene'' and posed ''a real, as opposed to a fanciful, risk'' to its audience; the board also said no amount of editing to the film could undo its decision. But on Thursday the board said it had certified ''The Human Centipede 2'' for viewers 18 and older after 2 minutes and 37 seconds of footage were removed. In a statement it said the film's British distributor ''was required to make 32 individual cuts to scenes of sexual and sexualized violence, sadistic violence and humiliation, and a child presented in an abusive and violent context.'' Among the scenes removed were the ''graphic sight of a man's teeth being removed with a hammer; graphic sight of lips being stapled to naked buttocks,'' and, well, quite a bit more. A version of ''The Human Centipede 2'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on Friday by IFC Films."

2011-10-07T00:00:00Z,"SCHWARTZ--Elayne P. Bernstein. It is difficult to write an obituary about someone who still lives. Elayne Polly Bernstein Schwartz passed away in Lenox, Massachusetts on October 4, 2011 from cancer. Born in the Bronx on October 29, 1924, she always liked to explain that she was conceived in China. Her parents, Jack Polly and Jean Morrison, returned from China to the U.S. to ensure Elayne's American citizenship. After spending her early years in China (where she learned lullabies she would later sing to her children), Elayne moved with her family to Brooklyn. After the death of her mother when Elayne was thirteen, her two aunts joined the household and jointly raised their children, including Elayne's older brother Sydney and her cousin Eileen, whom she regarded as a sister. From this experience, Elayne developed an unshakeable belief in the importance of family and extended family. Elayne was also a talented singer and actress. While at Erasmus Hall High School, she cut school one day in order to win the Betty Hutton Contest of Brooklyn. After graduation, she worked as a singer, performing on 52nd Street at the Zebra Club, and at the Onyx Club (she later called them ""dens of iniquity"") on the same bill with Lenny Bruce. After her marriage to high school sweetheart Harold Bernstein, Elayne moved to Great Neck, NY, in 1948, where she raised her five children. She served as a leader of the Free Nurses Institute of the Julia Bernstein League and was active in civic affairs, especially the effort to desegregate Great Neck Public Schools. Proud of her Jewish heritage, she was for many years an active member of both Temple Israel and Temple Beth El, starring in musical theater and singing in the High Holiday choirs. She proudly joined Beth El's first adult Bat Mitzvah class well after her five children had achieved this major milestone in their lives. And she was an ardent supporter of the Jewish Studies Program at Queens College. Her decision to enter Queens College as an adult mother of five was, she said, the most monumental one of her life, setting her on a path of education, inquiry and passionate engagement with the world of ideas, theater, art and music. She earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree (the latter magna cum laude), but her voracious appetite for education continued throughout her life and inspired her decades-long service as President of the Board of the Great Neck Public Library. She also privately supported the educational aspirations of disadvantaged children, enabling them to pursue successful careers in music and art. Her commitment to ORT led to the creation of the Elayne Bernstein Auditorium in Kiryat Yam, Israel to provide science and technology education to Ethiopian and Russian immigrant children. In conjunction with Peace Now, she sponsored two annual conferences in Lenox in which Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met to work on peace issues. Her sense of justice made her a truly righteous person. Elayne put her master's degree to work as an administrator at Queens College, where she was especially proud of organizing a 1985 conference on homosexuality and family life at the start of the AIDS epidemic, despite considerable disapproval. Most notably, she co-developed Backstage at the Berkshires, an adult education program at Queens designed to introduce the cultural treasures of the area to participants, with Shakespeare & Company as the crown jewel and the cultural/educational love of her life. Elayne supported Shakespeare productions everywhere she found them (becoming, for example, an ardent supporter of New York's Theater for a New Audience.) In Lenox Elayne served on the Board of Shakespeare and Company, working tirelessly to enable the organization to extend the reach of Shakespeare to everyone, especially young people. She was evangelical in her belief that Shakespeare speaks to us all. As a result of her devotion and support, Shakespeare and Company dedicated the Elayne P. Bernstein Theater (2009), the Bernstein Production Center, and, in 2011, Elayne's Corner, a garden that greets audience members on their way inside. Through her immersion in the cultural and artistic life of Lenox, Elayne met, fell in love with, and at age 80 married (in 2004) Sol Schwartz, and together they forged a joyous life of common interests in the arts, culture and education. Elayne is survived by her husband, Sol Schwartz; her cousin/sister Eileen Weinberg; her son and daughter-in-law Gene and Pamela Bernstein and their daughters, Jennifer Bernstein and Mindy Feinberg; her son and daughter-in-law Jay and Jill Bernstein and their children Julie Packin, Samantha Bernstein and Jamie Bernstein; her daughter Donna Bernstein and son Samuel Bernstein; her daughter and son-in-law Linda and Tony Rubin and their children Jacob and Gena Rubin; her son and daughter-in-law Matthew and Natalie Bernstein and their children Justin and Adam Bernstein; her grandsons-in-law Mark Feinberg and Ari Packin; her great-grandchildren Eliza and Jack Feinberg and Hallie Rose and Charlie Packin; and Sol Schwartz's children David and Risa Schwartz, and his grandson John. A memorial celebration will be held in the Elayne P. Bernstein Theater at Shakespeare & Company at 70 Kemble Street in Lenox, Massachusetts on Sunday, October 9, 2011 at 2pm. In lieu of flowers, it was Elayne's wish that memorial contributions be made to Shakespeare & Company (70 Kemble Street, Lenox, MA, 01240) or to HospiceCare in the Berkshires, Inc. (877 South Street, Suite 1 West, Pittsfield, MA 01201. Everyone who met Elayne benefitted from her engaging smile, capacious heart, her superb ability to listen without judgment and provide wise advice, and her joyous sense of life. Many more benefited from her generosity without having the privilege of meeting her. To the very end of her life, she remained a woman of untrammeled honesty, integrity and hope. Her interests in the world and the people in it can only be described as all-encompassing, all-embracing and life affirming. It is for these many reasons that Elayne lives on."

2011-10-08T00:00:00Z,"The Springfield nuclear power plant will remain operational, and it won't be closing time at Moe's Tavern for at least two more years: on Friday night, Fox announced that it had renewed its hit animated comedy ''The Simpsons,'' television's longest running prime-time scripted series, for two additional seasons, following a contract dispute with its voice cast that had threatened to end the show altogether. ''The Simpsons,'' which began as a series of cartoon shorts on Fox's ''Tracey Ullman Show,'' has been on the air as a continuous series since 1989, and has become a billion-dollar business for the network and the 20th Century Fox television studio, which produces it. But earlier this week, the studio acknowledged that it was in a standoff with the ''Simpsons'' voice actors, including Dan Castellaneta (who plays Homer Simpson), Julie Kavner (Marge) and Nancy Cartwright (Bart), who each now earn about $8 million a year for their work on the show, and whose salaries the studio was looking to cut by 45 percent. On Tuesday the studio said, ''We believe this brilliant series can and should continue, but we cannot produce future seasons under its current financial model.''"

2011-10-08T00:00:00Z,"SCHWARTZ--Elayne P. Bernstein. It is difficult to write an obituary about someone who still lives. Elayne Polly Bernstein Schwartz passed away in Lenox, Massachusetts on October 4, 2011 from cancer. Born in the Bronx on October 29, 1924, she always liked to explain that she was conceived in China. Her parents, Jack Polly and Jean Morrison, returned from China to the U.S. to ensure Elayne's American citizenship. After spending her early years in China (where she learned lullabies she would later sing to her children), Elayne moved with her family to Brooklyn. After the death of her mother when Elayne was thirteen, her two aunts joined the household and jointly raised their children, including Elayne's older brother Sydney and her cousin Eileen, whom she regarded as a sister. From this experience, Elayne developed an unshakeable belief in the importance of family and extended family. Elayne was also a talented singer and actress. While at Erasmus Hall High School, she cut school one day in order to win the Betty Hutton Contest of Brooklyn. After graduation, she worked as a singer, performing on 52nd Street at the Zebra Club, and at the Onyx Club (she later called them ""dens of iniquity"") on the same bill with Lenny Bruce. After her marriage to high school sweetheart Harold Bernstein, Elayne moved to Great Neck, NY, in 1948, where she raised her five children. She served as a leader of the Free Nurses Institute of the Julia Bernstein League and was active in civic affairs, especially the effort to desegregate Great Neck Public Schools. Proud of her Jewish heritage, she was for many years an active member of both Temple Israel and Temple Beth El, starring in musical theater and singing in the High Holiday choirs. She proudly joined Beth El's first adult Bat Mitzvah class well after her five children had achieved this major milestone in their lives. And she was an ardent supporter of the Jewish Studies Program at Queens College. Her decision to enter Queens College as an adult mother of five was, she said, the most monumental one of her life, setting her on a path of education, inquiry and passionate engagement with the world of ideas, theater, art and music. She earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree (the latter magna cum laude), but her voracious appetite for education continued throughout her life and inspired her decades-long service as President of the Board of the Great Neck Public Library. She also privately supported the educational aspirations of disadvantaged children, enabling them to pursue successful careers in music and art. Her commitment to ORT led to the creation of the Elayne Bernstein Auditorium in Kiryat Yam, Israel to provide science and technology education to Ethiopian and Russian immigrant children. In conjunction with Peace Now, she sponsored two annual conferences in Lenox in which Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met to work on peace issues. Her sense of justice made her a truly righteous person. Elayne put her master's degree to work as an administrator at Queens College, where she was especially proud of organizing a 1985 conference on homosexuality and family life at the start of the AIDS epidemic, despite considerable disapproval. Most notably, she co-developed Backstage at the Berkshires, an adult education program at Queens designed to introduce the cultural treasures of the area to participants, with Shakespeare & Company as the crown jewel and the cultural/educational love of her life. Elayne supported Shakespeare productions everywhere she found them (becoming, for example, an ardent supporter of New York's Theater for a New Audience.) In Lenox Elayne served on the Board of Shakespeare and Company, working tirelessly to enable the organization to extend the reach of Shakespeare to everyone, especially young people. She was evangelical in her belief that Shakespeare speaks to us all. As a result of her devotion and support, Shakespeare and Company dedicated the Elayne P. Bernstein Theater (2009), the Bernstein Production Center, and, in 2011, Elayne's Corner, a garden that greets audience members on their way inside. Through her immersion in the cultural and artistic life of Lenox, Elayne met, fell in love with, and at age 80 married (in 2004) Sol Schwartz, and together they forged a joyous life of common interests in the arts, culture and education. Elayne is survived by her husband, Sol Schwartz; her cousin/sister Eileen Weinberg; her son and daughter-in-law Gene and Pamela Bernstein and their daughters, Jennifer Bernstein and Mindy Feinberg; her son and daughter-in-law Jay and Jill Bernstein and their children Julie Packin, Samantha Bernstein and Jamie Bernstein; her daughter Donna Bernstein and son Samuel Bernstein; her daughter and son-in-law Linda and Tony Rubin and their children Jacob and Gena Rubin; her son and daughter-in-law Matthew and Natalie Bernstein and their children Justin and Adam Bernstein; her grandsons-in-law Mark Feinberg and Ari Packin; her great-grandchildren Eliza and Jack Feinberg and Hallie Rose and Charlie Packin; and Sol Schwartz's children David and Risa Schwartz, and his grandson John. A memorial celebration will be held in the Elayne P. Bernstein Theater at Shakespeare & Company at 70 Kemble Street in Lenox, Massachusetts on Sunday, October 9, 2011 at 2pm. In lieu of flowers, it was Elayne's wish that memorial contributions be made to Shakespeare & Company (70 Kemble Street, Lenox, MA, 01240) or to HospiceCare in the Berkshires, Inc. (877 South Street, Suite 1 West, Pittsfield, MA 01201. Everyone who met Elayne benefitted from her engaging smile, capacious heart, her superb ability to listen without judgment and provide wise advice, and her joyous sense of life. Many more benefited from her generosity without having the privilege of meeting her. To the very end of her life, she remained a woman of untrammeled honesty, integrity and hope. Her interests in the world and the people in it can only be described as all-encompassing, all-embracing and life affirming. It is for these many reasons that Elayne lives on."

Rowling books, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, above), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are cast out from the cocoon of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry into a perilous grown-up world, devoid of Albus Dumbledore, now dead, and other adult supervision. It's up to Harry to destroy the power of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) or risk losing his own life to his nemesis. The movie, directed by David Yates, ''belongs solidly to Mr. Radcliffe, Mr. Grint and Ms. Watson, who have grown into nimble actors, capable of nuances of feeling that would do their elders proud,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''Even though it ends in the middle,'' he added, this film ''finds notes of anxious suspense and grave emotion to send its characters, and its fans, into the last round.

''The Simpsons,'' now in its 23rd season, is the longest-running scripted series in prime-time television history.

But the favorites were YSL's suede loafers with giant gold plates bent like armor across the top of the foot. In a season that saw many straps and funnier shapes, it felt so solid.

He reminded audiences that he vetoed legislation granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and he signed a law requiring voters to show identification."
2011-10-09T00:00:00Z,"JUDGE--Margot Perona, of Roxbury, CT. died unexpectedly on the 11th of September while vacationing in Maine with her husband Jerry of 58 years, from a sudden and unforeseen aortic arch dissection. Margot was born January 10, 1930. She married Jeremy Judge, June 27, 1953 after a year abroad following her graduation from Douglas College. Margot was the loving mother of Geoff, Jennifer and Peter, and encouraged them in their professional pursuits and marriages to three amazing women, Mary Ann, Ethelind and Kathy. She enjoyed loving and close relationships with her grandchildren, Jennifer, Alex, Eric and Louis, her cousin Betty, and her sister-in-law Jen Howes and her children Deborah, Wendy, Cindy and Chris, and grandchildren Ashley, Willie, Hank, Noli, Clara and Jack with whom they enjoy the property in Roxbury. Margot was a tremendous volunteer raising money for a myriad of worthy causes while also knitting together a fabulous quilt of dear friends. As one friend put it, ""Margot Judge comes from an era of utterly classy ladies, family first, a matriarch with warmth, honesty and generosity for all that had the pleasure of relishing her company"" Charitable donations may be made in memory of Margot Judge to either Christ Episcopal Church, 4 Weller's Bridge Rd, Roxbury, CT 06783 or to Minor Memorial Library, 23 South Street, Roxbury."

2011-10-09T00:00:00Z,"As chief medical and scientific officer of the American Cancer Society, Otis Webb Brawley -- who is also a professor of oncology and epidemiology at Emory University -- is the public face of the cancer establishment. He operates in a world of similarly high-achieving, multiple-credentialed, respectable professionals, where insults tend to be delivered, stiletto-style, in scientific language that lay people aren't meant to understand. So it can be more than a little jarring to hear, for example, James Mohler, chairman of the urology department and associate director of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, say of his friend: ''I have known Otis for over 20 years. He doesn't come off as being ignorant or stupid, but when it comes to prostate-cancer screening, he must not be as intelligent as he seems.'' Or Skip Lockwood, the head of Zero, a prostate-cancer patient advocacy group, charge that Brawley is more concerned about saving men's sex lives than about saving the men themselves. Brawley has become the target of these attacks because of his blunt and very public skepticism about the routine use of the prostate-specific antigen, or P.S.A., test to screen men for early prostate cancer. ''I'm not against prostate-cancer screening,'' Brawley says. ''I'm against lying to men. I'm against exaggerating the evidence to get men to get screened. We should tell people what we know, what we don't know and what we simply believe.''"

But as young, creative types have snapped up homes, this west-end Polish enclave has morphed into a hub of local design and casual-hip dining. After a multiyear neighborhood reconstruction project that temporarily cut streetcar service and starved merchants, Roncesvalles Avenue -- the area's main artery -- is thrumming again. Despite their big-city location, the street's indie bookstores, quirky coffeehouses and smart boutiques feel more like small-town hangouts, with stroller-pushing locals popping in to chat up proprietors. Tree-lined and low-slung, with a blessed absence of the chain stores that have crept across Toronto, the rejuvenated ''Roncey'' now makes for one of the city's most engaging strolls. MICHAEL KAMINER"

There is even an on-site seamstress, to whip up, say, a set of napkins in the Unikko, the signature poppy print, or a pillow cover in the artist Astrid Sylwan's brushstroke-like Vattenblank.

Outrage over his long stay -- and its $1.4 million cost, largely unpaid -- erupted in more than 230 reader comments on NYTimes.com; below is a sampling. Readers also wrote about Ginia Bellafante's Big City column, which criticized the New York Police Department's response to Occupy Wall Street and some earlier protests. I've worked in many hospitals in the region, and this is an astoundingly common problem. Each state has its own laws. Whereas in NYC, an undocumented, uninsured individual is able to get dialysis covered, this is not true in New Jersey, and one cannot get discharged without a dialysis center accepting them. I have seen young men sitting in hospital beds for months and even years, while social work figures out how to get them placed. It's heartbreaking to see these people trapped in the hospital."

Elayne was one of the most remarkable and generous supporters of the arts and humanities throughout the Berkshires and beyond -- including Great Neck, Sarasota, New York City, and as far away as Israel. Her overriding passion revolved around Shakespeare & Company, where she served as a lifetime trustee. She discovered her love for Shakespeare in her middle years as a student at Queens College. She had always wanted to study theatre and the great playwrights in depth and threw her entire being into her courses with reverence and her ceaseless energy. Elayne always said, ""I came to it late but it filled my life thereafter."" When she married her beloved Sol Schwartz in 2004, Shakespeare & Company organized the event disguised as her 80th Birthday Party. In Sol, himself an artist, she had found a soul mate who loved the arts and Shakespeare & Company much like she did. In particular, Sol shared her passion for both the education programs and the beautification and development of the whole property. Together they forged a joyous life of common interests in the arts, not only in Lenox, but in Sarasota and New York as well. Elayne's special focus was Shakespeare & Company's nationally acclaimed and award-winning education programs, the largest in the Northeast, that annually reach more than 50,000 students and teachers with accessible and challenging performances, residencies and workshops. ""If we can get the kids inspired early on, it will stay with them all their lives."" In honor of Elayne's dedication and commitment, the Company named its new production center and theatre for her. Shakespeare & Company is now graced by The Bernstein Center for the Performing Arts, The Elayne P. Bernstein Theatre, and Elayne's Corner, a special garden with benches, a fountain and beautiful landscaping. Elayne was a passionate and inspired woman who possessed endless warmth and a sparkling sense of humor which charmed all who met her. She relished seeing Shakespeare's works performed on our stages, especially by our youngest artists. Elayne will be sorely missed by the entire cultural community of the Berkshires. Her impact will live on for generations to come. We will remember her always.....""So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."" -- William Shakespeare. A memorial service for family and friends will be held in the Elayne P. Bernstein Theatre at Shakespeare & Company on Sunday, October 9 at 2:00pm."

She is survived by her husband Peter Merrill-Oldham of Cambridge, her mother and father, Alice Cecarelli Merrill and James Hersey Merrill of Milford, CT, and her brother James Wallace Merrill of West Haven, CT. Janice Elaine Merrill was born on May 10, 1947 in Bridgeport Connecticut and raised in Milford Connecticut until she went to college, spending most of her summers with her grandparents Ed and Esther Trask in East Sumner, ME. She graduated from Jonathan Law High School in Milford in 1965 and from the University of Connecticut in Storrs in 1969. She married Peter Oldham in 1976 in Ashford, CT, and in 1978 they changed their last names to Merrill-Oldham. As the Malloy-Rabinowitz Preservation Librarian at Harvard University, Jan directed the Weissman Preservation Center in the Harvard University Library and the Preservation & Imaging Services Department in the Harvard College Library from November 1995 to February 2010. She created and administered a comprehensive program to preserve and enhance access to the 16.5 million volumes and extensive special collections and archives held in Harvard's more than 70 libraries. Jan became interested in the preservation of library collections while working in the bindery at the University of Connecticut Library. In 1979, a National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship at the Yale University Library allowed Jan to undertake formal training in library and archives preservation. She went on to earn a Masters in Library Science from the University of Rhode Island and to establish the University of Connecticut Libraries' Preservation Department. Over the course of 30 years, Jan became a recognized national and international leader in the field of library and archives preservation. Eager to learn and insatiably curious, she was an extraordinary teacher, mentor, author and administrator. Early on, her vision for libraries led her to move beyond the work of simply preserving collections to reformatting them for access via the Internet. Jan exercised her formidable powers of persuasion with university administrators, commercial suppliers, and by serving on key committees within the American Library Association (ALA), the Association of Research Libraries, the Council on Library and Information Resources, the National Information Standards Organization and many others. She authored and edited more than 40 publications. Jan's powerful influence within her profession was widely recognized. In 2011, the Association of Collections and Technical Services (ALCTS) and the Preservation and Reformatting Section (PARS) of ALA created a professional development grant in her honor. She also received the ALA/ALCTS Ross Atkinson Lifetime Achievement Award (2011), the ALA/PARS Banks Harris Award (1994), a University of Connecticut Distinguished Service Award (1994) and the ALA/PARS Esther Piercy Award (1990).

They may have tall chairs or wicker baskets for heads. There's no way to know if they're male or female, or of what race or class, but they're too dazzling for anyone to care. Yet people do, and they've been showing it by crowding the Mary Boone Gallery in Chelsea, where the latest examples of Mr. Cave's art are on display.

2011-10-09T00:00:00Z,"Packers (4-0) at Falcons (2-2) Sunday, 8:20 p.m. Line: Packers by 6. Tramon Williams's end-of-half interception return for the Packers against the Falcons in last year's playoffs may be remembered as a turning point in N.F.L. history. The Falcons were the better team entering the game, and while the Packers held a 21-14 lead before the play, the Falcons were driving and appeared likely to score. Williams's interception turned the game into a rout, and the Packers have been unbeatable ever since, while the Falcons have replaced them as the team with a young quarterback and lots of talent that cannot quite get its act together. Of course, for some that turning point arrived a little late. ''I'm really surprised that it kind of took him so long,'' Brett Favre said of the three interminable years it took Aaron Rodgers to lead the Packers to the Super Bowl. Who knew that through all of those quasi-retirements, through his stints with the Jets and the Vikings, Favre was just impatiently waiting for Rodgers to close the deal? Favre did not sound as if he was trying to insult Rodgers - he has simply lost the ability to compliment people who are not him - but teammates and analysts have rushed to Rodgers's defense, which he does not really need. It had been peaceful months since the last self-serving Favre rant. What took him so long? Pick: Packers Saints (3-1) at Panthers (1-3) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Saints by 6.5 . The proper transitional form between terrible and great for an N.F.L. team is not ''average,'' but ''interesting.'' Average teams get stuck at average, or worse, get stuck in the N.F.C. West. Interesting teams, with great strengths but fascinating flaws, are usually on the fast track up or down. The Panthers are going up; the road down goes straight through Philadelphia. The Panthers are interesting because Cam Newton has settled into his role as the league's hottest prospect. His developing skills in the pocket make him more than just a scrambles-and-bombs playground passer, though the scrambles and bombs remain frequent and fun. Steve Smith has been rejuvenated by Newton's presence and is averaging 22.1 yards per catch. The supporting cast - running backs Jonathan Stewart and DeAngelo Williams, tight ends Greg Olsen and Jeremy Shockey - is deep and multi-talented. Defensively, the Panthers do not have much, but that keeps things entertaining. The Saints are always interesting, except when they play the Jaguars, who bring the bland with them. The Panthers are no match for the Saints just yet, but they are now game for a 34-29 or 40-33 final score, which is the next best thing to winning after a year of watching Jimmy Clausen throw two-yard passes to Tony Fiammetta. Pick: Saints"

2011-10-09T00:00:00Z,"BLOCH--Florence J, on October 4, 2011. Until the age of ninety she fiercely guarded her independence. Responsibility to her values and beliefs was of fundamental importance to her. Her life was one of service- to her family, her immediate community of friends and associates, and the society in which she fulfilled various posts and positions with firm dignity. Born in Washington Heights and educated in New York City Public Schools, Florence Bloch graduated, Phi Beta Kappa, from Hunter College in 1936 and received a Master's Degree in German from Hunter in 1938. Had she been born in a later era she would have continued her education no doubt with distinction. Instead, for nearly three decades (1936-1962) Florence Bloch devoted herself to her alma mater as secretary of Hunter's redoubtable Classics Department, where, as a lecturer, she also put her fluency in Latin to good use. In her private life Florence chose looking after her parents as long as they lived over pursuit of personal happiness. From 1962 to retirement in 1981, Florence Bloch served generations of CUNY graduate students as Director of Financial Aid where her reputation for strictness was matched by her determination to afford all those who had a right to assistance their fair chance. Among other academic distinctions Florence was a founding member and inductee into the Hunter College Hall of Fame (1972) and received the President's Medal from the CUNY Graduate Center (1981). In addition to Phi Beta Kappa, she was a member of Eta Sigma Phi (National Honorary Classics Society) and Sigma Epsilon Phi (National Honorary German Society). From early days, Florence Bloch was a consummate New Yorker attending and supporting its cultural events from ballet to the opera to its many museums. She was a diehard Dodger fan and once knew the batting averages of all her beloved Bums. Her volunteer work after retirement included her helping reorganize the local branch of New York's Finest. She was also a seasoned, indefatigable traveler who had little time for trees unless they were painted. She did not hesitate to refer to herelf as a television junkie, for she watched Congressional hearings on C-Span for days on end with all the fervor she once spent on baseball. Florence Bloch is survived by her nephew, Donald Bloch, of Amsterdam, Netherlands. Contributions in her memory may be made to the Graduate Center Foundation, 365 Fifth Avenue, 8th Fl., New York, NY 10016."

2011-10-09T00:00:00Z,"Because of an editing error, an obituary last Sunday about Robert Whitaker, an official photographer for the Beatles, referred incorrectly to the 1966 Beatles album ''Yesterday and Today.'' It was a compilation released by Capitol Records in the United States without the Beatles' direct involvement; it was not ''a lesser effort by the Beatles.'' And although it did contain songs that had appeared on the British version of the ''Help!'' album, it did not contain the song ''Help!'' (Until 1967, the contents of the British and American versions of Beatles albums were not identical.) The obituary also referred imprecisely to the content of ''Yesterday and Today.'' While it did contain songs that had appeared on previous Beatles albums and that would appear on the group's album ''Revolver'' later that year, those songs were only on the British versions of those albums, not the American versions."

An acclaimed acting teacher, Mr. Pressman was head of The Neighborhood Playhouse School of Theater from 1957-1963, and started the Boston University acting program in the early 1950s. He was an original member of The Actors Studio. A successful director of early dramatic live television from 1947 until 1952, he fell victim to the McCarthy blacklist and was unable to work in television for almost twelve years. During that time he continued to teach and direct theater, including the acclaimed Broadway production of ""The Disenchanted"" starring Jason Robards in his first Broadway role. Mr. Pressman later directed the award winning play ""Summertree"" at Lincoln Center. He returned to directing television in the 1960s, with such shows as ""The Defenders and NYPD"". He went on to direct ""One Life To Live"", for which he won three Daytime Emmys. He continued directing until his retirement at the age of 85. A decorated World War II veteran with two Purple Hearts, Mr. Pressman saw combat for two years with the 45th Infantry Division in Italy, France and Germany. He was a beloved, kind and generous man, a loving husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He will be missed. He is survived by Sasha, his wife of 70 years; his three sons Gregory (husband of Emily), Michael and Eugene; grandchildren Joanna, Naomi, Joshua, Rachel and Brooks; and three great-grandchildren.

He had his models paint their faces in the bohemian-urchin style of Paris in the '20s, with darkened eyes and red lips, finished off with shingle haircuts. Then he put the girls in pants. Technically these were split skirts, but who cares? The effect was the same. Long before Yves Saint Laurent issued le smoking, square Norman was there. ""They may seem a little avant-garde at first,"" he told The Times after his 1960 show, for which he received a standing ovation, ""but I really do believe in the look."" He had uncanny instincts for anticipating change: the elongated sweater look, the return of waistlines in the mid-'60s, the dolman-sleeve rage of the early '70s. He showed leopard patterns in the '40s. The flapper makeup told a lot about Norell as well: stage-struck at an early age, he designed costumes in the '20s at the Astoria studio of Paramount Pictures, dressing Gloria Swanson in ""Zaza,"" and later worked on Broadway musicals and burlesque shows before moving to ladies' fashion."

The Columbia University psychiatry department is a partner in the effort. Although the popular image of live-in centers for people recovering from substance abuse runs more toward campus-like complexes in bucolic settings, where fresh air and natural beauty replace the lures of drugs and alcohol, this one - intended to serve as a transition from rehab to real life - is in the midst of a heavily traveled night life zone, near bars, clubs and restaurants that would seem to pose threats to a resident's hard-won sobriety.

So there we were, a trim, tanned, tieless former prime minister, his press secretary, an aide, a book publicist, a photographer and his two assistants and a reporter, all occupying one room in which the air conditioning seemed not to be functioning. At the conclusion of the interview, a flustered Cherie Blair rushed in to join the party, apparently after overhearing from the next room too many questions concerning reports that had run in the conservative tabloid that has dogged the Blairs for decades.

2011-10-10T00:00:00Z,"-A stage version of ''The King's Speech,'' the film that won the Academy Award for best picture this year, is no longer on a fast track to Broadway, as its author and one of its producers had originally envisioned. The play by David Seidler, who won an Oscar for best original screenplay for the film, will have a world-premiere production in February in Guildford, England, and then tour theaters in five other British cities through mid-March, according to the producers. A London production of the play may follow, according to a spokesman for the show, and Broadway remains a possibility. Mr. Seidler and one of the producers, Michael Alden, previously said that they could envision the play going straight to Broadway as early as this year, to capitalize on the popularity and critical success of the film. Instead, Mr. Seidler and the creative team will have a chance to refine the script and staging during the tour, and the producers will be able to assess the appeal of the story without its two film stars, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, whose performances were essential to the movie's success."

2011-10-10T00:00:00Z,"Boxing robots were No. 1 at the North American box office over the weekend, as ''Real Steel'' (DreamWorks Studios/Disney) sold an estimated $27.3 million in tickets. That total was solid, but the picture, which stars Hugh Jackman as a reluctant father, will need to continue drawing large audiences to justify its hefty production budget of $110 million and tens of millions more in marketing support. Many critics disliked ''Real Steel,'' but audiences, especially younger moviegoers, gave it strong marks in exit polls. ''The Ides of March'' (Sony Pictures Entertainment/Cross Creek Pictures) was second, taking in about $10.4 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. ''Ides,'' a well-reviewed political drama starring Ryan Gosling and George Clooney, cost just $12.5 million to make after tax rebates. ''Dolphin Tale'' (Warner Brothers/Alcon Entertainment) was third, taking in about $9.2 million for a three-week total of $49 million. ''Moneyball'' (Sony) was fourth with an estimated $7.5 million in ticket sales for a three-week total of $49.3 million. And the comedic drama ''50/50'' (Summit) was fifth in its second weekend, taking in $5.5 million for a new total of $17.3 million."

Having made three movies about Danny Ocean and his Rat Pack-like team of casino-heist experts, as well as critically acclaimed films like ''Traffic,'' ''Erin Brockovich'' and ''Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' Steven Soderbergh has turned to the only subject that was left for him: a biographical movie about Liberace. On Tuesday HBO said that Mr. Soderbergh would direct a film called ''Behind the Candelabra'' for the cable channel, about the relationship between Liberace, the flamboyant pianist, and his live-in lover Scott Thorson, who later filed a palimony suit against him. Michael Douglas, the ''Wonder Boys'' and ''Wall Street'' star, will play Liberace in the film, and Matt Damon, who has worked with Mr. Soderbergh in the ''Ocean's Eleven'' series, ''The Informant!'' and ''Contagion,'' will play Mr. Thorson.

And it's an idea bolstered by the fact that her first two albums earned her a Mercury Prize nomination each. Marling's newly released third effort, ""A Creature I Don't Know,"" poetically titled like all her albums, trades some of her teenage urgency for a more muscular, acrobatic lyricism - the result being 10 tracks that feel evolved, or more grown-up even.

2011-10-13T00:00:00Z,"GALVIN--Robert W.,longtime chief executive officer of Motorola, passed away on October 11 in Chicago at age 89. The son of Paul Galvin, the founder of Motorola, Bob was born in 1922 in Marshfield, Wisconsin. He attended Evanston Township High School in Evanston, Illinois, where he excelled in academics, student government, the debating society, and sports. He joined Motorola full-time in 1944, earning his way up through various positions. He was CEO from 1959 to 1986 and chairman until 1990. During that time, the company grew from $290 million to $10.8 billion in annual sales. Under his leadership and through the principles that his father imbued in the company, Motorola became a world leader in communications technology. Most notably, it led the creation of the global cellular telephone industry, installing the first prototype cell phone demonstration system in Washington, DC in 1971; unveiling the first portable cell phone prototype, the DynaTAC, in 1973; enabling the first commercial cell phone call, made on the DynaTAC by Ameritech, in 1983; and introducing MicroTAC, the first compact cell phone, in 1989. Throughout his career, Galvin made crucial investments in cellular and semiconductor R&D and advocated tirelessly for competitive telecom regulation and fair trade across the globe. He measured himself and his executive team by the company's treatment of its workforce, and he was proud that Motorola employees, who knew and referred to him simply as 'Bob', never felt the need to unionize in any of its global operations. Due largely to his commitment to continuous renewal and customer satisfaction, Motorola received the U.S. Commerce Department's Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for Manufacturing in 1988. Galvin expanded Motorola's footprint into Europe, Southeast Asia, Israel, India, Japan, and Latin America, and made a major early push into China. He helped pioneer Technology Road-mapping and the Participative Management Program, founded Motorola University, and developed the Six Sigma Quality improvement system, which he disseminated across the globe. He was a trusted advisor to generations of US presidents and cabinet leaders, serving a term on the US Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and acting as lead business liaison in numerous US Trade Representative, State Department, and Defense and Intelligence delegations. He also chaired the Commission to Reorganize US National Laboratories (known as 'the Galvin Commission'), the Commission on the Future for the National Science Foundation, and Sematech, the government initiative to revitalize US semiconductor competitiveness. In retirement, he joined his sons in founding investment management firm Harrison Street Capital, established two non-profit think tanks Perfect Power and the Galvin Transportation Initiativeand wrote several books, including The Genius of People: What the Scottish Enlightenment Taught Our Founding Fathers and The Idea of Ideas. Galvin was committed to the cause of education, notably through his support of the Illinois Institute of Technology. The recipient of several honorary doctoral degrees, he was elected to the American National Business Hall of Fame and awarded the National Medal of Technology, the Vannevar Bush Award, and the French Legion of Honor medal. He was a devoted husband of 67 years to Mary Barnes Galvin and an inspiring, loving father to his four childrenGail Galvin Ellis, Dawn Galvin Meiners, and Christopher and Michael Galvin. He is also survived by 13 grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren (with one on the way), and eight valued in-laws. Bob delighted in passing time with family and friends, singing on the player piano and debating policy, books and ideas. He loved playing tennis, snow skiing, waterskiing, windsurfing and sculling. He discovered his highest passions pursuing the principles of leadership, innovation, creativity, integrity, and dignity and respect for all. His was an inspiring, principled, loving and accomplished American life. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him well. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that gifts in memory of Bob be directed to the Robert W. Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation at Illinois Institute of Technology; send to Betsy Hughes at Illinois Institute of Technology, 10 W. 35th St., Ste. 1700, Chicago, IL 60616 (312-567-5045).

This very permanent checkmate -- or is it? -- was the culmination of a lengthy chess game plotted out by Vince Gilligan, the creator and show runner of ''Breaking Bad,'' and members of his writing team, who had been planning for a season-ending showdown between Walt and Gus on this AMC show. ''It was something my writers and I worked on pretty much the whole season, knowing that at the end of the year, one of them would have to go,'' Mr. Gilligan said in a phone interview. ''The town wasn't big enough for the both of them, as it were. In the best sense of the movie 'Highlander,' there could be only one.''"

And since vast shopping opportunities often end in devastating splurges, I arrived to test-shop the store with a plan: 10 items, $200 (which meant that the +J section on the second floor was off-limits). I started at the beginning, the bottom floor, where walls of cashmere V-neck sweaters bragged grand-opening price tags ($89.90 marked down to $49.90). So as not to throw the entirety of my allowance at four candy-colored sweaters, I jumped on the theme-park-style escalators and went straight up to the third floor. It was there that I did a double take: Japanese engineered denim for $9.90! With $190 left, I grabbed a men's flannel shirt ($29.90), a fluffy down vest ($49.90), a two-for-one Breton-striped lounge set ($24.90) and a pair of very holiday slippers ($12.90; if I don't wear them, someone in my family will come Christmastime); $72.50 to go and my winter shopping was almost done. Then I turned a corner and found myself staring into an aquarium-like tube filled with the company's famous (and effective!) Heattech pieces. I chose a knit cap ($12.90) and matching gloves ($12.90), a pack of socks ($9.90) and a camisole ($12.90). I had $23.90 left, enough for a pink umbrella ($12.90). Who knew Uniqlo sold umbrellas? Chic ones! Had I just $2 more - $11 was all that was left - I'd have bought two."

Owen Bernstein imparted his beliefs, through work, action and example, to his children and grandchildren, and touched the lives of so many with his sweetness and gentleness. For these qualities he was adored by his family: Wife Bebe Kirschenbaum Bernstein; Daughters Freya Bernstein and her husband Dr. Martin Broff, Karen Bernstein Belfer and her husband Andrew Belfer; and his four Grandchildren James, Gaby, Adam and Samantha.

Dr. Levitan joined Mount Sinai in 1968 and for more than four decades, carried out an extensive research agenda in population genetics. In 1999, he made the groundbreaking discovery that the chromosomes of Drosophila robusta had changed in response to global warming, a finding that was widely influential in the fields of evolution, genetics, anatomy, biology, meteorology, and environmental health. ""My research was never intended to fuel the global warming debate,"" he said at the time, adding, ""Now we have to see whether this is happening in other species and populations."" Dr. Levitan published widely--his seminal Textbook of Human Genetics first appeared in 1971--but above all, he was a beloved teacher and a cherished mentor to generations of students.

James, the 91-year-old monarch of British crime fiction, better known for her novels about Adam Dalgleish, the brainy Scotland Yard detective who writes poetry on the side. Faber & Faber, the British publisher, announced that Ms. James's newest book, which comes out in Britain on Nov. 3 and will be issued in the United States by Knopf early in December, is called ''Death Comes to Pemberley'' and involves Elizabeth in a murder investigation. According to the publisher the book begins in 1803, when Elizabeth and Darcy have been married for six years and are raising two sons at Pemberley, Darcy's estate, but their tranquillity is disturbed when Elizabeth's sister Lydia rolls up in a carriage late one night, screaming that her husband has been killed. This will come as no surprise to fans of the original novel: Lydia's husband is the caddish Wickham, who elopes with her in that book, causing the family no end of shame and distress."

(HBO) GULLIVER'S TRAVELS (2010) In Rob Letterman's modern-day adaptation of the novel by Jonathan Swift, Jack Black, above, portrays Lemuel Gulliver, a mail-room clerk on the adventure of a lifetime after being shipwrecked on Lilliput, an island populated by tiny people, next to whom the rotund Mr. Black looks like a giant. Billy Connolly is the king of the fantasy land, Emily Blunt his princess daughter, and Amanda Peet the gleaming woman Lemuel pines for. ''For myself, I was but seldom inspired to peals of true laughter, though I did relish that part when Mr. Black, confronting a fire raging in the Palace of Lilliput, douses the blaze through heroic use of such means as Nature has provided him,'' A. O. Scott, channeling Swift, wrote in The New York Times. ''This was, indeed, the only moment at which it seemed that the temperament of the Picture corresponded, in some degree, to my own.'' He added: ''I can further suppose that a Child of average Wit or even moderate Dullness -- a boy of Nine, let us say, who can be coaxed away from the Wii of a Christmas afternoon -- might pass a pleasant interval chuckling at the absurd incongruities that arise when something very large is placed beside something very small.'' 10:30 A.M.

Michigan is trying to climb back to national prominence. The winner gets sole possession of first place in the Leaders Division of the Big 10. Michigan State comes in with the top defense in the nation, allowing 173.4 total yards a game and having held four of its five opponents to 7 points or fewer. Spartans linebacker Denicos Allen had two sacks against Ohio State last week. Michigan quarterback Denard Robinson, right, is electrifying but has nine interceptions. The Wolverines are outscoring opponents, 114-21, in the second half, and much of the credit goes to the defensive coordinator Greg Mattison. NO. 18 ARIZONA STATE AT NO. 9 OREGON 10:15 p.m. Eastern, ESPN Arizona State has two victories over top-25 teams and is a favorite in the Pac-12 South, but the Sun Devils will still be a 14-point underdog in Eugene. That may be because the two ranked teams that the Sun Devils defeated have since fallen out of the top 25 and because Oregon's offense is averaging more than 50 points a game. The Ducks, who dropped their season opener to Louisiana State but easily won their next four games against suspect opponents, could be without running back LaMichael James, who leads the nation with 170.4 rushing yards a game. Arizona State's defense has forced 18 turnovers this season, third most in the nation. Sun Devils cornerback Alden Darby has three interceptions in the last two games, and middle linebacker Vontaze Burfict is an intimidating presence."

2011-10-16T00:00:00Z,"''THEIR batteries have probably all melted,'' said the photographer Mary Ellen Mark, looking with wry affection at the crowd of robots that have taken up residence in her downtown loft. ''I'm a bad robot mom.'' Pink fembots in frilly aprons! Mean metal guys with clock bellies! For this second installment of the Collect Call column in T: The New York Times Style Magazine, in which I track people's sometimes baffling, sometimes amusing, sometimes magnificent collections, I've come to examine Ms. Mark's need to -- if you can stand it -- save the robots. ''It started 10 or 15 years ago,'' she said. ''I don't collect for their value -- I don't think I've spent more than $150 for one -- but for their personalities. Some of them are very common. I have a robot camera, maybe my favorite robot, and I even have a robot pillow. And I have a witch robot! But that's at home.''"

2011-10-16T00:00:00Z,"In 2007, a real estate agent, eBay peddler and amateur historian named John Maloof purchased 30,000 unattributed negatives on a hunch. This turned out to be the bulk of Vivian Maier's undiscovered oeuvre, virtuosic street photographs taken by a reclusive Chicago nanny who died quietly in 2009 at age 83, just before her work went viral. She is now considered to be a lost master of the form, the Windy City's own Helen Levitt. A giddy press has provided for her a whole slate of lofty comparisons: to Diane Arbus, Brassai, Walker Evans and Weegee. Her eye for midcentury street fashion - fox stoles, bonnets and bird-cage veils - made her something of a proto-Sartorialist. But she could also slum it with street urchins, drooling bums and sideshow performers. Or mine the Loop late at night shooting perp walks. Suffice it to say, her work was not published in her lifetime, and ''Vivian Maier: Street Photographer'' (powerHouse, $40), edited by Maloof, is the first book on this important woman about whom so little is known. As Geoff Dyer puts it in his brief introduction, Maier ''is someone who exists entirely in terms of what she saw.'' Her photos, remarkable in their range, show an uncommon affinity with children, perhaps unsurprising given her work. ''She was like Mary Poppins,'' one of her charges from the 1960s recalled recently in Chicago Magazine. ''She had an amazing ability to relate to children.'' In a weird twist, Maier was hired briefly in the '70s by the talk-show host Phil Donahue to care for his children. ''I once saw her taking a picture inside a refuse can,'' he said. ''I never remotely thought that what she was doing would have some special artistic value.''"

2011-10-16T00:00:00Z,"THE 69-year-old British textile brand Ascher has been collaborating with artists since the 1950s when the founder Zika Ascher had his friends -- Henri Matisse, André Derain and Henry Moore, among them -- design silk scarves better suited for galleries than girls' closets. Now, Ascher's grandson, Sam, is reviving the tradition with two scarves by the Chinese artist Zao Wou-ki, one of the company's original contributors. ''When Zao Wou-ki first worked with us, he was 24 or 25, and just starting out,'' he said.

2011-10-16T00:00:00Z,"They met in 1929, in the photographer's shop where she worked, in Munich. He was 40, she was 17. He devoured her with his eyes, she said. Soon after, he had her family investigated, to check that her bloodlines were Aryan. He was Adolf Hitler, an amateur artist whose charisma as a reactionary orator had propelled him to the forefront of Germany's National Socialist party. She was Eva Braun, an attractive blonde from a middle-class family who, after one year at a school run by nuns, was back home living with her parents. We know how the story ends, though we can't help wondering why - was she completely lacking in intelligence, or morals, or both? In ''Eva Braun: Life With Hitler,'' translated from the German by Damion Searls (Alfred A. Knopf), Heike B. Gortemaker takes on a task few biographers - I'm tempted to say no biographer in her right mind - would tackle, so scant and unreliable is the material. Braun's letters to Hitler, which numbered in the hundreds, were burned at his behest. His letters to her have never surfaced; supposedly wrapped in plastic and buried, per her instructions, they are now presumed to have been destroyed as well. There are 20 pages of a diary, which at least one expert has deemed a forgery. The silent solidarity of Hitler's inner circle, which constituted an embargo on all personal information, broke down only after the war. But the testimony that emerged from the de-Nazification hearings at Nuremberg was blatantly revisionist, offered up by friends and associates eager to minimize their involvement, scrambling to save their own lives."

2011-10-16T00:00:00Z,"In the American fall collections of 1960, Norman Norell did something seemingly too radical for a man who ate most of his meals at Schrafft's and Hamburg Heaven. He had his models paint their faces in the bohemian-urchin style of Paris in the '20s, with darkened eyes and red lips, finished off with shingle haircuts. Then he put the girls in pants. Technically these were split skirts, but who cares? The effect was the same. Long before Yves Saint Laurent issued le smoking, square Norman was there. ''They may seem a little avant-garde at first,'' he told The Times after his 1960 show, for which he received a standing ovation, ''but I really do believe in the look.'' He had uncanny instincts for anticipating change: the elongated sweater look, the return of waistlines in the mid-'60s, the dolman-sleeve rage of the early '70s. He showed leopard patterns in the '40s. The flapper makeup told a lot about Norell as well: stage-struck at an early age, he designed costumes in the '20s at the Astoria studio of Paramount Pictures, dressing Gloria Swanson in ''Zaza,'' and later worked on Broadway musicals and burlesque shows before moving to ladies' fashion. Norell has always been something of a quiet genius of American fashion - he was born Norman David Levinson on April 20, 1900, in Noblesville, Ind., and got his surname by chopping down ''Norman'' and taking one ''l'' from ''Levinson'' and the other from ''looks.'' And so it's intriguing to find a personal trove of Norells from the '60s and '70s, some of it in mint condition. On Oct. 19, the site 1st Dibs will sell more than 100 ensembles that belonged to Beverly Dowis Blettner, a Chicago socialite and philanthropist."

2011-10-16T00:00:00Z,"Songs simmer awhile inside her head before choosing their own moment to froth out fully formed. Or so has claimed Laura Marling, a 21-year-old British sensation who is perhaps the quintessential folk singer of her generation. It's a romantic idea, this ghostly pale lass with wispy blond hair transmuting somehow - perhaps via inspiration from the Muses - her own admittedly tangled emotions into divinely inspired songs to be sung by her divinely bestowed voice. And it's an idea bolstered by the fact that her first two albums earned her a Mercury Prize nomination each. Marling's newly released third effort, ''A Creature I Don't Know,'' poetically titled like all her albums, trades some of her teenage urgency for a more muscular, acrobatic lyricism - the result being 10 tracks that feel evolved, or more grown-up even. In any case, it's clear that when Marling found this new sound, the Muses did not abandon her. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

If the place is Provence, France, and you are interested in old things, especially textiles and folk costumes, you may have had a glancing acquaintance with the antiquarian Michel Biehn, an inescapable presence in the region from the late 1970s until last year. Biehn began small with a stand at the Aix-en-Provence flea markets, trading up to a cupboard-size shop on the Place des Trois Ormeaux, where he preached the gospel of Provencal boutis - wood-blocked quilts that, when he entered the business, were used as moving blankets to wrap Louis XVI commodes at chateau sales. Having attracted a following, Biehn moved on, living and dealing on the main drag in L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue in a town house whose hulk and hauteur seemed not accidental echoes of his own. Like Christian Lacroix, Cote Sud, Pierre Deux and braids of garlic, he's been an indivisible part of the global post-Picasso fashion for all things Provencal."

''It was a goddess born from the water.'' Twelve years later, he took that image as inspiration for ''Goddess,'' featuring a 26-by-19-foot clay sculpture built in his studio in Songzhuang, an artists' village on the outskirts of Beijing. As with all of his work, Wang constructs elaborate tableaux, which he then photographs and dismantles. For ''Goddess,'' he imagined Lady Liberty in a Mao suit, a reflection of China's struggle between two ideals: the beliefs of the chairman and the tenets of democracy. The scaffolding around the sculpture alludes to the vast unfinished construction sites in China; the chickens that wander through the rubble enjoy a freedom that he believes the Chinese people do not. Though he has had only a few direct confrontations with the authorities (usually over nudity), Wang expects ''Goddess'' to be controversial. ''People have lost their dreams and their ideals,'' he said.

(It's probably under a heap of clothes somewhere in her Lower East Side apartment.) But it's hard not to forgive her. She's only 20 after all, and isn't that what all 20-year-olds do?

2011-10-16T00:00:00Z,"SHEPHERD--John, M.D. John Shepherd, M.D.,a renowned cardiovascular researcher, past president of the American Heart Association, Chair of the Space Medicine Committee of NASA, Head of Research and Dean of the Mayo Medical School died on October 4th in Rochester, Minnesota at the Mayo Clinic, where he spent most of his career. He was 92. He was born on May 21st, 1919 in Northern Ireland and received his M.B., B.Ch, M. Chir and M.D with honors from Queens University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Subsequently he completed his internship and residency at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. Later he joined the academic staff at Queens in the Department of Physiology. In 1953 he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to come to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota for one year to engage in cardiovascular research. He returned to Northern Ireland but eventually emigrated to the US in 1957 to join the Mayo Clinic. Notably Dr. Shepherd and his three close colleagues in the small department of Physiology at Queen's University all later became Deans of Medical Schools around the world. Remarkably for the son of a Presbyterian minister from rural Ireland, he was one of 15 physicians in his family including his daughter, his son who is on staff at the Mayo Clinic and his grandson and namesake who is at Mayo Medical School. He made major contributions to understanding the regulation of the vascular system, particularly how the nervous system regulates blood pressure, producing over 300 scientific publications and four books. He was President of the American Heart Association in 1975-76. He was also a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in the UK and Ireland. Over the years he was the recipient of many awards including honorary degrees from the Universities of Bologna, Ghent and Queens. He was also actively involved with National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) and the National Academy of Sciences where he was a member and subsequently Chair of the Committee on Space Medicine 1965-1974. During this time, he had many interactions with colleagues behind the Iron Curtain in the USSR working on space physiology. Many of their exercise and fluid protocols are still used in space travel. This led to his major hobby: collecting space-themed stamps. He developed one of the world's largest such collections. The Mayo Clinic was his professional home and he made many contributions to this institution. He was Director of Research from 1969 -1976. In this position, and as a member of the Board of Trustees, he was instrumental in enabling Mayo to become a separate degree granting institution in 1972 from the University of Minnesota. He became Director for Education of the Mayo Foundation and Dean of the new Mayo Medical School from 1977 1983. This included responsibility for the Mayo Graduate School of Medicine and Mayo School of Health-Related Sciences. Later from 1983-1988 he chaired the Mayo Board of Development and was actively involved in the development of the first Mayo satellite in Jacksonville FL. He retired from Mayo in 1989. In 2003, he published Inside the Mayo Clinic, a memoir. He was predeceased by his first wife, Helen Johnston Shepherd. He is survived by his wife, Marion Etzwiler Shepherd and his children, Gillian Shepherd Mestre, New York, NY; Roger Shepherd, Rochester, MN; stepchildren Nancy Etzwiler O'Neill, Lisa Etzwiler Clary, Diane Etzwiler Thallon, David Etzwiler, five grandchildren, eight step-grandchildren and one great-grandson. A Memorial Service will be held at The First Presbyterian Church, Rochester MN at 11am, Saturday October 22. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Mayo Foundation."

She was 70. Mrs. Sideris passed away while en route to New York City from her home in Greece. When the Ronald McDonald House opened its doors in New York City in 1978, Mrs. Sideris was there from the start. Among the many challenges faced by Greek families coming to New York City in search of better treatments and cures for their children's illness was the lack of affordable housing, an intimidating language barrier, and an inadequate family support system. Founding the Greek Division, Mrs. Sideris organized fundraising and educational events as a way to enlighten the local Greek community about Ronald McDonald House New York's mission to provide not just housing, but a comprehensive support system for families battling pediatric cancer. In addition to the Greek Holiday Party, Mrs. Sideris introduced the annual spring marathon event, which she referred to as her ""Marathon of Love."" She had arrived in New York City in 1970 where she met her late husband, Dr. Michael Sideris. They enjoyed a loving union that ended with his death in January 2005. Mrs. Sideris leaves behind her legacy of giving, kindness, and awareness of how a caring and compassionate community within New York City can give hope to thousands of families in crisis. A viewing will be held for Mrs. Sideris on Monday, October 17, 2011 from 3pm8pm, at the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity at 319-337 East 74th Street, New York, N.Y. 10021.

2011-10-16T00:00:00Z,"I met Patti Smith at the Electric Lady recording studios on West Eighth Street in Manhattan on a sunny August afternoon. Both the place and the date have a special significance in Smith's personal mythos and in the broader mythology of rock 'n' roll. The facility, which you enter through a nondescript storefront on a once famously scruffy block now given over to discount shoe stores and student-friendly eating places, was Jimi Hendrix's brainchild, and it stands as an enduring part of his legacy. A rack in the reception area is stocked with foldout LP sleeves of some of the legendary records that were cut here - Stevie Wonder's ''Talking Book,'' AC/DC's ''Back in Black,'' David Bowie's ''Young Americans'' - and the psychedelic murals that Hendrix commissioned line the subterranean hallways leading to Studio A. There, his portrait hangs in the lounge, a benevolent godhead gazing down at the latter-day strivings of his fellow musicians. ''Actually, this coming Friday is the 41st anniversary of when it opened,'' Smith told me as she settled into a couch under Hendrix's gaze. She is, by her own admission, a prodigious talker, seeming at once to choose her words carefully and to wander through mazes of memory and free association. ''And it's also the anniversary, which is so amazing to me, of when I met Jimi Hendrix on the steps.'' This was at a party to which Smith, then a young journalist, had been invited. ''But I was too shy to go in. I was sitting out on the steps in my straw hat, and my polka-dot dress, whatever I was wearing back then, and Jimi was on his way out, and he stopped to talk to me. He took 10 minutes to tell me about his hopes and dreams for the studio. It was an amazing thing that happened. I was, like, 22 at the time, and I had no aspiration to record - no thought that I would ever make a record in my life.''"

2011-10-16T00:00:00Z,"Last spring I met Patti Smith to discuss her art -- specifically her photographs, of which there is a selection at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford that opens on Oct. 21. Smith told me over lunch that taking pictures is one of the reasons that she has continued to tour these past decades (that and supporting her band, of course). But music has given her a means to see the world and to record it with her quiet, romantic and magnificently narrative eye. It is this synchronicity that A. O. Scott captures in his profile of Smith (''Requiem Lass,'' Page 94) as he goes into the studio -- Hendrix's Electric Lady, no less -- and behind the lens with this wonderfully original American artist. This issue is filled with artists who follow their own inclinations with tenacity and style. There are the Arctic Monkeys (Page 92), who tour the world with a Ping-Pong table to let off steam between sold-out shows. There is Kirsten Dunst (Page 98), who we have watched grow up on screen, from Mary Jane in ''Spider-Man'' to Marie Antoinette to Justine, the central figure in Lars von Trier's ''Melancholia,'' for which Dunst won best actress at Cannes. There is the British folk sensation Laura Marling (Page 106), whose precociousness as a songwriter keeps garnering accolades and astonishment from the music press. There is the singer Zola Jesus (Page 36; listen to her new album, ''Conatus'') and the actress Amber Heard (Page 29), arguably the coolest bombshell to emerge from Hollywood in some time.

2011-10-16T00:00:00Z,"KELLER--Frederick A. A major creative force in Western New York theater, education and film, and a pioneer in Buffalo television broadcasting, died Wednesday, October 5 in Los Angeles. He was 92. In 1947, Mr. Keller was one of four employees of WBEN Radio, then owned by The Buffalo Evening News, assigned to visit various experimental television stations around the country in preparation for the start-up of Buffalo's first TV station WBEN, now WIVB-TV. Shortly after the station began scheduled programming, Mr. Keller was appointed program director, a position he held until he left the company in 1962. In those daysmost of our programs were produced 'live' in our studios or on location, Mr. Keller wrote in a brief biography he penned in April 1997. As program director he created, produced, wrote, directed and supervised telecasts as they were going out on the air, including the first-ever dramatic weekly series to be televised, The Clue. That series, which lasted for five years, gave Academy Award-winning actor Broderick Crawford and Lorne Green of TV's Bonanza fame, their first acting opportunities in television. Mr. Keller also produced the first educational series of programs for children seen in Western New York. In those days, I had high hopes for television as an educational medium for the betterment of our world, Mr. Keller said. Mr. Keller also helped bring a number of important foreign and domestic art films to Buffalo, through the Circle Art and Glen Art theatres. He also appeared in a number of films, making his screen debut in the 1970 George Stevens film The Only Game in Town, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Warren Beatty. While living in Paris for seven years, Mr. Keller dubbed some 400 foreign films into English. He also portrayed the title character in a 1981 adaptation of Natalie Babbit's award-winning novel, Tuck Everlasting, directed by his son, Frederick K. Keller and co-wrote and starred in the 1987 independent film My Dark Lady, starring Buffalo actress Lorna Hill. On the stage, Mr. Keller Played Willy Loman in the 1960 Studio Arena production of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. The following year, he took the Grand Island Players' presentation of Miller's A View from the Bridge to the Festival International du Theatre in Monaco. He also directed other notable productions, including works such as Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun and Ossie Davis' Purlie Victorious. Mr. Keller taught acting, film and theater courses at the University at Buffalo, Erie Community College, Canisius College, Medaille and Niagara County Community College. Born in Buffalo, New York he was a graduate of South Park High School. He earned his bachelor's degree in general education from Buffalo State College and his master's degree in the foundations of education at the University at Buffalo. Mr. Keller was a captain in Army intelligence during World War II and was awarded the Bronze Star. He was part of a team of army intelligence officers who determined during the Battle of the Bulge that the Germans were recycling names of divisions instead of sending new troops to the front lines, which ultimately led to victory. Since 2000, Mr. Keller had lived in retirement in Southern California with his son and daughter-in-law. He taught a weekly course on Shakespeare and wrote a book on the Shakespeare authorship question, Spearing the Wild Blue Boar which was published when Mr. Keller was 90. Last year, at 91, he performed in David Mamet's The Duck Variations. He is survived by his wife Joyce D. Keller Ph.D. and son, film and television director Frederick King Keller. A Memorial Service will be held on Saturday, October 22 at 1:00pm at Gates, Kingsley & Gates Moeller Murphy Funeral Directors, The Little Chapel of the Dawn, 1925 Arizona Avenue, Santa Monica."

2011-10-16T00:00:00Z,"In 1979, George Segal, the famous Pop artist, was commissioned to create a sculpture to commemorate New York City's Stonewall uprising in 1969 - the seminal (although not the only) event to kick-start the gay liberation movement. The bronze sculpture, covered with a white patina, was finally unveiled in Christopher Park in Greenwich Village in 1992, after years of controversy. It depicts a life-size male couple standing a few feet away from another life-size female couple sitting on a park bench. Beth Suskin, my partner of 35 years, and I, Leslie Cohen, were the models for this sculpture. This is our love story. August 1965. My mother and my friend Lois have accompanied me on the 400-mile drive from Bayside, Queens, to Buffalo State, a teacher's college, where I am to begin my freshman year. After we unpack and settle in, we decide to explore the campus. As we walk past room after room, my mother suddenly stops at an open door. Uh, oh. Her Jewdar has picked up familiar accents. Before I can stop her, she sticks her head into the doorway. Beth's parents look up from the large trunk they are unpacking. Beth is preoccupied - giving instructions. My mother greets them as if they were long lost cousins, and we begin sharing our information. ''Where are you from?'' ''N.Y. - Queens - and you?'' ''Hewlett Harbor.'' ''Oh, really?! Did you just arrive?'' ''Yes.'' ''Is Beth a freshman too?'' ''Yes.'' ''Oh, maybe you two can be friends,'' my mother says. ''Wouldn't that be nice?'' I self-consciously look at Beth and see that she is beautiful - way beyond ordinary beautiful. She is elegant, like Catherine Deneuve. We smile. ''I'm sure I'll see you on campus,'' I say. And we move on. She was the first freshman I met at Buffalo State."

The area thrived during the gold and silver rushes of the 19th century, filled with saloons, hotels and stores catering to miners headed for the surrounding mountains. After the rush ended, the neighborhood fell into disarray, but in the 1960s, a group of local businesspeople, led by the Denver preservationist Dana Crawford, started buying up century-old buildings with the goal of making Larimer a retail center. Chains like Williams-Sonoma soon invigorated the neighborhood; eventually, more homegrown boutiques started opening. Now, its collection of retail outlets, spread along a short block strung with lights, are mostly owned by locals.

If there was glamour to be found, it was in the dreams that struggled to survive against the odds. Jules Allen first stepped into the famed Gleason's Gym in 1983 -- when it was still in Manhattan, where he was a relatively new photographer. He had gone there to train -- which he did with Bobby McQuillan, who had also put Miles Davis through the paces. Mr. Allen was in his own way as hungry as any up-and-coming boxer: he had a vision of how he wanted to document African-American culture. He wanted to portray his subjects as people who were powerful and in control."

He was very shy and sweet, and then it was like - O.K., done,'' recalls Kirsten Dunst over sorbet and strawberries, describing how she came to play Justine, the central character in ''Melancholia,'' Lars von Trier's astonishing end-of-the-world flick. In person, Dunst is stunningly unpretentious. (When a taxi driver wonders why a paparazzo is bothering the fragile blond woman he has just picked up, she points to her face and jokes, ''Hello? 'Spider-Man'?'') At least on the surface, she has nothing in common with the magical, moody Justine, a character she describes as a ''romantic depressive, maybe even from another planet.'' Whoever Justine is, this haunting film (it gave one viewer, me, nightmares for weeks afterward) is hardly a joy ride. But Dunst insists the workplace atmosphere was anything but gloomy. ''The family on the set was so wonderful,'' she says, especially the two Charlottes - Gainsbourg, who plays her sister, and a riveting Rampling as her mother. ''For such an unfunny subject, it was so much fun. And hanging out with Lars - he is the funniest, but it takes a second to get used to his sense of humor.''"

Mr. Ward found great joy in his family, his profession and his personal development. During his career, Mr. Ward directed or was responsible for exploration, planning, development, processing, smelting, marketing and other activities in the mineral industry on six of seven continents. Mr. Ward's experience covered the world and spectrum of metals, minerals and ores ranging from A to Z, (Antimony to Zinc and Australia to Zambia). Mr. Ward's success and rise to meeting the upper ranks of management was fostered by the support of the wonderful cadre of individuals who helped him meet the challenges of the business in a creative and cost effective manner, by a desire to keep abreast of new techniques and an ability to gain the assistance of all levels of the operations that led to cost reductions and improved performance, morale and profitability. Mr. Ward relished creating and growing shareholder value of mining organizations. Mr. Ward was President, Chairman and CEO for Cypress Amax Minerals Inc.

''I was just a kid in England doing this thing that became gigantic and global,'' said Mr. Cox, who was 31 at the time. Then came what he now calls his Second Album Syndrome. ''Wannabe was so huge,'' he reflects. ''So big. So unexpected.'' What could he possibly do to top it? Though the company chugged along for a few years, Mr. Cox eventually sold it in 2007. He traveled. He opened a bakery. Until a serendipitous meeting with executives from the shoe giant Geox ushered him back into the footwear world earlier this year.

A copy has simply lived more: it contains within it not just the image or idea at hand, but also the imprint of time, place or identity linked with that moment as well as the motive of duplication. ""Versions,"" Laric's video treatise on this subject, features an animated slide show of contemporary copies (the infamously Photoshopped 2008 image of missile tests in Iran, in which the missiles were cloned for heightened visual impact; Internet memes like the Zidane head butt, remixed and disseminated by users around the world); and historical antecedents (recycled character animations from early Disney movies; figurative archetypes taken from classical sculpture) that trace its relevance back to far before copy and paste was a way of life.

2011-10-17T00:00:00Z,"Regulators have faced a barrage of complaints from lawmakers and financial industry lobbyists in their 14-month-long quest to constrain risky trading on Wall Street, an effort known as the Volcker Rule. Now, as regulators begin a push to produce a final draft of the rule, they face hurdles from an unexpected group: themselves. Though several federal agencies agreed last week to propose the initial version of the Volcker Rule, they are divided over some of its crucial details. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, for example, has pushed for tough language that would require bank executives to vouch for their compliance with the Volcker Rule - a measure that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been fiercely resisting, say people close to the regulators."

2011-10-17T00:00:00Z,"Hollywood's box-office blues continued over the weekend as remakes of ''Footloose'' and ''The Thing'' fizzled. ''Real Steel'' (DreamWorks Studios) repeated as No. 1 by a sliver, taking in about $16.3 million for a two-week total of $51.7 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticketing statistics. ''Footloose'' stumbled in second place, selling an estimated $16.1 million in tickets, a frail result given the months-long marketing push that Paramount Pictures lavished on the film. The good news: ''Footloose,'' built around a cast of unknowns, cost only about $24 million to make. ''The Thing'' (Universal Pictures) was third with $8.7 million in ticket sales - not exactly a bloodbath given its production cost of about $38 million but a disappointment nonetheless. George Clooney's ''Ides of March'' (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was fourth, taking in about $7.5 million for a two-week total of $22.2 million. ''Dolphin Tale'' (Warner Brothers) rounded out the top five with $6.3 million in ticket sales, lifting its four-week tally to $58.7 million. For the weekend, North American theaters recorded $89 million in ticket sales, a 32 percent drop from the same weekend last year.

(HBO) SING YOUR SONG (2011) In 1956 Harry Belafonte (above, center) became the first recording artist to sell more than a million LPs with his album ''Calypso'' -- thanks in part to its smash single, ''Banana Boat (Day-O)'' -- and in the process broke color barriers as he rose to success during segregation. ''Get them to sing your song, and they will want to know who you are,'' his mentor Paul Robeson had counseled him following an early performance at the Village Vanguard. Still, although he went on to be honored with Grammy, Tony and Emmy Awards, Mr. Belafonte was blacklisted during the McCarthy era, harassed by the House Un-American Activities Committee, spied on by the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., and threatened by the Ku Klux Klan, state troopers and Las Vegas Mafia bosses. This documentary from Susanne Rostock distills more than 700 hours of interviews, excerpts from F.B.I. files and archival film footage to chronicle the life and times of Mr. Belafonte, now 84, from his birth in Harlem and his childhood in Jamaica to his work with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., his struggle against apartheid in South Africa and his actions to counter gang violence and the incarceration of youth. Tony Bennett, Diahann Carroll, Ruby Dee, Whoopi Goldberg, Quincy Jones, Coretta Scott King, Miriam Makeba, Nelson Mandela, Sidney Poitier, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Andrew Young comment.

2011-10-17T00:00:00Z,"SAN DIEGO -- Watching all those people juggling phones and tablets and e-readers in stores, subways and coffee shops, not to mention the many small shops continually offering new models of phones, you could think that there are more wireless devices than people. You would be right. Data released this week from CTIA, the wireless industry association, shows that there were 327.6 million wireless customer connections, equal to 103.9 percent of the United States population. This is the first time there have been more customers than people. It is also a 9 percent increase from the 300.5 million connections of a year ago. Not bad, for a country teetering near recession, where about one-third of the population lives with little or no discretionary income."

2011-10-17T00:00:00Z,"SIDERIS--Niki. Founder and Chairman of the Ronald McDonald House New York Greek Division. The Board of Directors, Volunteers, and Staff wish to express our sincere sympathy over the passing of our friend, advisor, and Founder of the Greek Division at Ronald McDonald House New York, Mrs. Niki Sideris, who died on October 12, 2011. She was 70. Mrs. Sideris passed away while en route to New York City from her home in Greece. When the Ronald McDonald House opened its doors in New York City in 1978, Mrs. Sideris was there from the start. Among the many challenges faced by Greek families coming to New York City in search of better treatments and cures for their children's illness was the lack of affordable housing, an intimidating language barrier, and an inadequate family support system. Founding the Greek Division, Mrs. Sideris organized fundraising and educational events as a way to enlighten the local Greek community about Ronald McDonald House New York's mission to provide not just housing, but a comprehensive support system for families battling pediatric cancer. In addition to the Greek Holiday Party, Mrs. Sideris introduced the annual spring marathon event, which she referred to as her ""Marathon of Love."" She had arrived in New York City in 1970 where she met her late husband, Dr. Michael Sideris. They enjoyed a loving union that ended with his death in January 2005. Mrs. Sideris leaves behind her legacy of giving, kindness, and awareness of how a caring and compassionate community within New York City can give hope to thousands of families in crisis. A viewing will be held for Mrs. Sideris on Monday, October 17, 2011 from 3pm8pm, at the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity at 319-337 East 74th Street, New York, N.Y. 10021. The liturgy will be held on Tuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11am. In lieu of flowers, donations can be sent to Ronald McDonald House New York at 405 E. 73rd Street, New York, NY 10021. For more information, contact Spiridoula Katechis at 212-639-0188. We are grateful for the extraordinary opportunity of counting Mrs. Sideris as part of our family and love and care she offered so freely to those she touched in life! Respectfully, Stanley B. Shopkorn Chairman of the Board William T. Sullivan President and Chief Executive Officer Ronald McDonald House New York"

Among them was Alex Zachary, one of New York's most idiosyncratic galleries both in terms of space and location. (It has been operating out of a multilevel, formerly residential condominium a couple of blocks from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.) Fittingly, the artist Ken Okiishi's project at Zachary's Frame booth was a curious meditation on the psychogeography of Manhattan real estate and mythologies of uptown bohemia. Eulogizing the recently shuttered Lexington Avenue establishment Gino as a point of departure (which over time has hosted luminaries as diverse as Sophia Loren, I. M. Pei and Robin Byrd), Okiishi began by outfitting the booth in the iconic Scalamandré-designed zebra wallpaper that made its debut in the restaurant's dining room circa 1930. He applied the same print to parasols bolted to the walls, whose slow and steady motorized twirling evoked bygone pageantry and ritziness. Faux-antique photographs of an early-20th-century apartment were hung beside the umbrellas; in actuality these were digital images lifted from the present-day Streeteasy.com listing for a unit on West 67th Street that was once home to Marcel Duchamp, from 1916 to 1918. East Side, West Side, Depression era, recession era: Okiishi's project drew foggy connections between places and times that are factually disparate but psychically proximate. These artifacts repurposed as ready-mades contribute to a meandering mental map of the city that relies on legends like Duchamp (and Gino's) as its compass."

Shoes from the designer's footwear collection, Mark McNairy New Amsterdam, and tailored pieces from the Ivy League-inspired outfitter J. Press, where McNairy was formerly creative director, have made their way into an eclectic mix of closets, from traditional to trendy. When it was announced this summer that McNairy would introduce a complete line of subversive-preppy clothes and accessories for men in the spring, all those fans cheered, and now - it's official - he's doing women's wear, too. Inspired by his daughter, Daisy, the 50-piece collection is charmingly boyish, but (very McNairy) sexily so, with oxford shirts paired with boyfriend boxers and rugby tanks over miniskirts. Echoes of some of the men's line motifs - a daisy print, an exploded camouflage and a floral-on-plaid shirt - mix easily with more overtly feminine pieces, like the ditsy Laura Ashley-like button-down. ""Basically, I make women's clothes from a guy's point of view,"" McNairy says. ""It has nothing to do with fashion - they're items that transcend trend."""

Ms. Davenport received an initial $20,000 advance for the tale, which was scheduled for publication next summer.

The owner, Jessica Kelso, was inspired by traditional Scandinavian bathhouses - ""löyly"" is Finnish for the steam produced when water is poured over sauna rocks - and wanted to bring their sense of accessibility to Stumptown. ""I felt like your choices in Oregon were a hippie hot springs experience or really spendy, overly attentive spa experiences, neither of which had ever appealed to me,"" she says. The Löyly vibe is one of communal shvitzing rather than solitary pampering. A $15 fee gets you access to an elegantly designed cedar sauna, wet steam room and lounge; though massages and facials are available by appointment, scrubs, salts, masks and foot soaks are do-it-yourself. The place has become as popular with corporate types as it is with the city's artists, musicians and restaurant servers. ""Everyone looks the same wrapped in a white towel,"" Kelso says, ""although we do see a lot of tattoos in Portland."""

Now the Guggenheim Museum is hoping to make some money by turning the phenomenon back in the other direction. The museum has entered into a licensing agreement with Fine Paints of Europe, a Vermont company that produces high-end commercial paints, to create a set of 200 interior and exterior wall colors drawn from well-known paintings in the Guggenheim's collection and from wall colors that curators, artists and designers (including Frank Lloyd Wright himself) have used for exhibitions over several decades. The artists' colors are drawn from paintings in the museum's collection by figures like Cézanne, van Gogh, Kandinsky and Franz Marc, whose ''Stables'' from 1913 provides a yellow that seems cheerful enough to brighten even the most depressing windows-look-out-onto-an-air-shaft New York apartment. Neither the museum nor the company disclosed the value of the licensing agreement. The paints range from $35 to $130 per can."

He also failed to show up at performances on Friday and Saturday nights. There was scant official information about Mr. Ross's condition; Gabriel Tesoriero, a publicist for him, did not respond to telephone messages. On Friday afternoon a plane carrying Mr. Ross from Fort Lauderdale to Memphis had to return to Florida and make an unscheduled landing after he became ill. He was traveling to Memphis to perform at an open University of Memphis basketball practice. After being treated at a Fort Lauderdale hospital, Mr. Ross was released that evening and issued a statement via Twitter saying ''Memphis here I come.'' He chartered a jet for the trip. But the second plane was also forced to land unexpectedly, in Birmingham, Ala., after Mr. Ross became sick a second time. News outlets in Birmingham reported that Mr. Ross had been admitted to the University of Alabama-Birmingham Hospital, but a spokeswoman at the hospital, Jennifer Lollar, said he was not on the public list of patients. She said that some high-profile patients may opt not to be listed, and that the hospital releases no information about their condition. On Saturday Mr. Ross was to appear at a restaurant in Memphis and to perform in Greensboro, N.C. He canceled both appearances without explanation."
2011-10-18T00:00:00Z,"An article on Monday about a proposed engineering graduate school in New York City contained a number of errors. Because of an editing error, the article misidentified the university that has dropped plans for a partnership with City University to develop the school. It is Columbia University, not Stanford. Also because of an editing error, the article referred incorrectly to a partnership between Stanford and City College, a branch of City University. Such a partnership is indeed planned; it is not the case that Stanford officials said last week that the university would not enter such a partnership. The article also described incorrectly an unrelated 7-million-square-foot expansion that Columbia University is planning. A portion of the expansion that will be devoted to studying the brain will occupy about 7 percent of the space, not ''much of it.'' And the article referred incorrectly to the teaching of engineering at New York University. The university had a school of engineering at its Bronx campus until 1973; it is not the case that N.Y.U. did not have an engineering school ''until 2008.''"

2011-10-19T11:06:37Z,"This season, design is busy doing its bit for charity. The Moment recently reported on the Pink Swan Project, in which designers riffed on Arne Jacobsen's classic Swan chair. Now comes Kartell Loves Milano, an auction on Oct. 25 by Sotheby's at the Rotondo della Besana in Milan. Proceeds from the sale will benefit the Umberto Veronesi Foundation, which supports scientific research. (Its founder, for whom the foundation is named, is a surgeon and oncologist known for his innovations in cancer treatment.) For the auction, 45 individuals and groups - from the worlds of design and architecture, art, fashion, music, photography, food and even sports - will reimagine one of the Italian manufacturer Kartell's plastic furniture designs, while also paying tribute to the city of Milan, Italy's design and fashion center. While it's now become commonplace to see a fashion house like Missoni or DSquared2 reworking a chair or a mirror, it's still a novelty when the soccer club A.C. Milan or the D.J. Linus does it. An interesting design-world statistic: of the 45 participants, 29 chose to put their stamp on pieces designed by Philippe Starck - including Starck himself, who has probably done more than any other designer to make Kartell, which pioneered plastic furniture designs in the 1950s, a global brand today."

Mullen, the firm's first executive partner, an invaluable colleague and a cherished friend. He was 83 years old. Mr. Mullen formally served as Skadden's executive partner from 1981 to 1994 and informally for several years prior. He joined the firm in 1961 as an associate and was named partner in 1962. He became of counsel at the firm in 1998, and he recently celebrated his 50th anniversary at Skadden. Mr. Mullen was a key architect of Skadden's growth globally and was highly respected by all for his wise day-to-day leadership of our institution. Together with Joe Flom in 1988, Mr. Mullen helped establish the Skadden Fellowship Foundation, which has provided two-year fellowships to more than 600 young lawyers seeking to pursue public interest law. Mr. Mullen was a champion of numerous charitable causes, having served as a trustee, director or member of ORBIS International, The Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, The Advisory Committee of The Southwest Legal Foundation, The Legal Aid Society, Volunteers of Legal Services, The United Way, and The Cardinal's Committee of the Laity, among other organizations. He also was a member of the board of directors of the Gregorian University Foundation of New York and Rome, having served as chairman until last year. From 1985 to 1992, he was chairman of the Georgetown University Board of Directors. Mr. Mullen was a member of the New York State Bar Association Committee on Securities Regulation from 1980 to 1983. Mr. Mullen graduated cum laude from Georgetown University in 1948 and earned his LL.B. from Columbia Law School in 1951, where he was a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar. We join his wife Billie, sons Peter and Jeff, and daughters Kirby, Elaine and Lucy, as well as his nine grandchildren, in honoring his memory. All donations in honor of Peter Mullen should be made to The Gregorian University Foundation, Project ORBIS or The Lake Waramaug Task Force.

2011-10-19T00:00:00Z,"MCGINTY--John Edward. September 24, 1946 - October 14, 2011. John E. McGinty, a senior advisor in the investment banking department of UBS, died at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, MA on Friday, October 14 of complications of multiple myeloma. He was 65 years old. Born in St. Louis and educated at Northwestern University and the University of Chicago, McGinty began his career in 1970 at the boutique New York City investment firm of H.C. Wainwright, training with John Suydam as a machinery analyst in a revered research department. Wainwright was acquired by Weeden & Co. and in 1977, when the company closed its doors, McGinty moved to First Boston in the same role. He continued as a managing director when First Boston was acquired by Credit Suisse, providing coverage based on, in some cases, relationships that extended over three decades. Ranked by Institutional Investor magazine among the top machinery analysts in 31 of his 33 years in the industry (occasionally in more than one category), McGinty became the centerpiece of the firm's global effort in machinery. He was a voice of enthusiasm in the research department and a willing mentor to younger analysts, an uncommon trait on Wall Street. He retired from Credit Suisse in November 2006 and moved to UBS as a senior advisor in investment banking. A strong believer in education, McGinty served as a trustee to Salve Regina University, was an active alumnus of Chicago Booth, and contributed to initiatives at Milton Academy, the Rivers School, the investment committee of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, Goddard House in Brookline, MA, and Trinity Church Boston. He also established the first girls town soccer league in Montclair, NJ. An avid golfer and devoted family member, he is survived by five sisters, his wife of 40 years, Sarah Myers, and three children, John, Sarah, and William, all of Boston, MA. Funeral service and reception will be held at Trinity Church Copley Square Boston at 10am on October 22. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the John E. McGinty history chair at Salve Regina University c/o the Office of the President, 100 Ochre Point Ave., Newport, RI 02840."

2011-10-19T00:00:00Z,"For weeks, we have been told that the N.F.L. has turned into a passing league. That the pinball-machine passing and scoring numbers were the new norm. That all the rules changes over the past three decades had left us with a game that looks more like the Arena Football League. Then Week 6 came. You might have heard that the first four weeks of this year featured the four highest single-week passing yardage totals in league history. That was a little misleading, as each of those weeks had 32 teams playing, which was not the case for most of league history. But even on a per-game basis, the first four -- and then the fifth -- weeks of this season had huge passing numbers. In the first four weeks, the average team gained 246 passing yards and scored 22.8 points per game. In Week 5, the 26 teams playing averaged 239 passing yards and 25 points per game. But this past week, while the average team passed for 232 passing yards, scoring dropped to 20.1 points. And that drop in points can be attributed to the drop in passing touchdowns. There were 54 passing touchdowns in Week 1, and another 54 in Week 2. Last week -- the first with teams on byes -- 26 teams passed for 45 touchdowns, an even higher average per team game (1.73) than in the first two weeks. But the 26 teams this past weekend passed for only 27 touchdowns, and that includes the fake-field goal touchdown pass from Oakland punter Shane Lechler. In each of the first two weeks, 18 teams had at least two touchdown passes. This weekend, only 7 of the 24 teams threw for multiple touchdowns."

They're also members of a large and tight-knit family, attended prep school together as teenagers and now live in condominiums in a converted Jersey City warehouse that was their first project as a team. This new series tags along as these cousins follow their passion for transforming dreary kitchens into works of art, starting with a brownstone galley lacking counter space and storage. They decide to take the room down to the studs and build it back up, blending original brick walls and yellow pine floors with modern Italian cabinets and a stainless-steel island. 6:10 P.M. (Encore) THE RUNAWAYS (2010) Kristen Stewart, below, portrays Joan Jett, and Dakota Fanning is Cherie Currie, the guitarist and lead singer for Ms. Jett's real-life band of the title in this biopic set in Southern California in the mid-1970s. ''Girls can't play the electric guitar,'' a teacher informs Joan. ''This is not about women's lib,'' counters Michael Shannon, as the promoter Kim Fowley, who takes the girls under his wing and preaches a brand of macho feminism. ''It's about women's libido.'' Reviewing this feature-film debut from Floria Sigismondi, based on Ms. Currie's memoir, and with Ms. Jett as an executive producer, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: '' 'The Runaways' balances nostalgia for wild bygone times with a cautionary sense of their less heroic side. Acknowledging the brazen, rebellious energy of rock 'n' roll at the dawn of punk, Ms. Sigismondi also tallies the costs that an ardent, ambitious love of the music can exact.'' He added, ''The movie may be a little too tame in the end, but at its best it is just wild enough.''"

2011-10-19T00:00:00Z,"-Four original members of UB40, the British reggae band that sold more than 70 million records, have been declared bankrupt by a judge in Britain, the BBC and Billboard reported. A judge in the Birmingham County court said government tax officers could seize the band's assets and property to pay off outstanding debts in a ruling against the saxophonist Brian Travers, the drummer Jimmy Brown, the trumpeter Terence Oswald and the percussionist Norman Hassan. The judge's order follows the collapse of the band's record label, DEP International, which caused a fight over finances that led to a rift among the members in 2008. That year the lead singer, Ali Campbell, left the group, because of ''management difficulties'' and ''an ongoing investigation into the handling of my business affairs,'' according to a statement he released at the time."

And the article, using information from the Web site of Max Vadukul, who shot the photos of Mr. Ai's project, overstated Mr. Vadukul's role with Rolling Stone magazine.

His rookie year with St. Louis in 2010 was overrated by many who viewed him as a surefire star. He finished near the top of the league in passes, inflating his yards and touchdown statistics. Yards and touchdowns are not necessarily good ways to grade quarterbacks, but that does not stop people from doing so. He played for a team that was 1-15 the year before his arrival, so he received credit for any regression to the mean in the form of a significant increase in wins in 2010 (the Rams improved to 7-9). And his team played a weak schedule (4.2 points below average, second easiest in the league)."

He was an accomplished man: He graduated cum laude from Georgetown University in 1948 and earned his LL.B. from Columbia Law School in 1951, where he was a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar. He was a visionary attorney: He joined the firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom in 1961. He served formally as Skadden's executive partner from 1981 to 1994 (and informally prior to 1981), becoming a key architect of Skadden's growth globally. He was instrumental in establishing the Skadden Fellowship Foundation. Peter Mullen was highly respected by all in the legal community. Guided always by his Catholic faith, he championed many charitable causes. Among others, he was Chairman of the Georgetown University Board of Directors; he also served as Chairman and Board Member of both ORBIS International and the Gregorian University Foundation. He was President of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick. Other organizations he served included The Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, The Advisory Committee of The Southwest Legal Foundation, The Legal Aid Society, Volunteers of Legal Services, The United Way, The Cardinal's Committee of the Laity and the Vatican Observatory. He felt his greatest accomplishment was his family and the life he built on the shores of Lake Waramaug in Litchfield County, CT. He was happiest when he was surrounded by his loving wife of 56 years, Billie; his children, Peter, Kirby, Elaine, Lucy and Jeff and their spouses; and his nine grandchildren. He was an avid sailor, skier, golfer, tennis player, gardener, birdwatcher, bush-hogger and neighbor. He was a friend and advisor to all. All in all, a life well lived!! In the end, he was optimistic about life, he was able to celebrate an early Thanksgiving with his family, attend mass and go out to dinner. He will be greatly missed.

''Priscilla'' earned $860,673, about 59 percent of the maximum possible gross last week; the show earned $920,741 during the playing week that included Memorial Day weekend, while it reached a low point of $547,180 in early September. The producers of ''Priscilla'' revamped their advertising and marketing strategies this fall, including highlighting the involvement of producer Bette Midler, and also began offering an unusual money back guarantee through group sales offers to help the musical through the fall. September and October are traditionally slow months at Broadway box offices - shows often close soon after Labor Day to avoid a fall slump - but ''Priscilla'' sales have been improving fairly steadily. According to the Broadway League database, ''Priscilla'' has earned more money since Labor Day than another new musical, ''Sister Act,'' and two recent winners of the Tony Award for best musical, ''Billy Elliot'' and ''Memphis.''"

The New York Times was part of this, with coverage on the anti-Qaddafi forces' hasty acquisition, production and fielding of all manner of repurposed arms and the vehicles to carry them. Often these weapons were poorly used. Sometimes they were fired just as indiscriminately as the weapons fired by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's troops that NATO, in its United Nations-approved bid to protect civilians, claimed to marshal international will to stop. Some of these weapons were also instrumental in the anti-Qaddafi militias' eventual success, as was visible in Misurata. (For a fuller view of many of these themes, read this report on the hidden plant in Misurata, or these explainers on the dangerous repurposing of 57-mm air-to-ground rockets or 122-millimeter Grad rockets or, in this case, the knuckleheaded firing of plainly labeled inert rockets toward Qaddafi forces in Libya's mountainous west.)"

2011-10-20T00:00:00Z,"4:59 p.m. | Updated The Andy Warhol Foundation announced on Wednesday that it will dissolve its authentication board early next year. In a statement, the foundation said the move reflects its intent to shift focus toward maximizing ''grant making and other charitable activities.'' In recent years, the foundation has been involved in legal disputes over its authentication process for works whose owners said they were by Warhol. One long-running lawsuit brought by Joe Simon-Whelan, a filmmaker who bought a work identified as a Warhol self-portrait in 1989 only to see it later declared inauthentic on two occasions by the board, contended that the foundation and the board had conducted a 20-year conspiracy to inflate the prices by denying the authenticity of a certain number as a way to create artificial scarcity. The board and foundation denied the accusations. After more than three years and rising legal bills, Mr. Simon-Whelan dropped the case. Others who had bad experiences with the board claimed it favored museums and powerful dealers over individual collectors, another charge foundation officials denied. Still, some dealers and collectors view the decision as irresponsible since it is the mission of the Warhol Foundation's to promote and protect the reputation and authenticity of the Pop master's art."

The campaign's outside general counsel, Bill Canfield, said he believed that fewer than 10 planes were involved and that the amount to be reimbursed was ''in five but not six figures.'' He said the campaign would amend its finance report filed last weekend and ask the Federal Election Commission for an opinion to resolve what he called differing interpretations of the relevant rules."

The label's opener was Benjamin Boeldt's project, Adventure, which played one slick early-1980s electro-pop song after the next, with occasional bursts of shrillness."

''Sweet Home Alabama: Outtakes & Updates,'' featuring extra footage from the inaugural season, leads in at 8.

(HBO2) CATFISH (2010) In this festival favorite from Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, Nev Schulman (Ariel's brother), right, a 24-year-old New York City photographer, becomes entangled in an Internet relationship with a Michigan family that includes an 8-year-old art prodigy and her beautiful older sister -- with whom Nev supposedly falls in love. Reviewing the film in The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote: '' 'Catfish' flops down into this paradoxical reality and proceeds to generate some complications of its own. Judged by the usual standards it is a wretched documentary: visually and narratively sloppy; coy about its motives; slipshod in its adherence to basic ethical norms.'' He added: ''But at the same time -- precisely because of these lapses -- 'Catfish' is a fascinating document, at once glib, untrustworthy and strangely authentic. I say this with a heavy sigh: this is, by far, one of the most intriguing movies of the year.''"

2011-10-20T00:00:00Z,"Evanescence, a gothic-flavored alternative rock band, made a big splash in the early 2000s. Now the band has returned to the top of the music charts with its first new album in five years, although the sales are far from the blockbuster numbers of its -- and the music industry's -- heyday. The new album, ''Evanescence'' (Wind Up), sold 127,000 copies in its first week out, according to Nielsen SoundScan.That amount was significantly less than the 447,000 sales the band enjoyed when it released ''The Open Door'' in 2006, but it was enough to send the band to No. 1 on Billboard's album chart. ''Fallen,'' the band's debut, has sold 7.5 million copies since it was released in 2003."

Let's be clear: ''Future Now'' wasn't really a jazz showcase, even if all three acts on the bill -- the Robert Glasper Experiment, and the vocalists José James and Taylor McFerrin -- have varying degrees of jazz experience. The show's compass pointed more toward sleek and stylishly woozy electro-soul, after the example of the influential producer J Dilla."

2011-10-20T00:00:00Z,"A KNEE-GRAZING leather skirt, longer and fuller than a pencil skirt, is proving to be a fall statement piece, a look that leans more toward lady than rock 'n' roll. ''Now that fashion has moved in a softer, more feminine direction, the sometimes strict look of leather is less appealing,'' said Amanda Brooks, the women's fashion director of Barneys. ''Thus the longer, softer shapes we're seeing in leather now.'' Perhaps the first piece to grab the attention of the fashion pack was the black leather wrap skirt on the Altuzarra fall runway, shown with a smart argyle sweater. A tweak on chic grunge, it sold out at Net-a-Porter, despite a $4,890 price tag. At the recent spring shows, several young women, far left, looked demure, and tough, in pleated leather skirts with buttoned-up silk blouses and pullovers. Barneys is now stocked with curvaceous fishtail skirts in real ($1,795) and faux ($650) leather from Junya Watanabe's brilliant fall collection.

Since the pages of The New York Times Magazine close more than a week before they hit newsstands, we can't outrun the news. So this week's interview with the C.E.O. of Netflix, Reed Hastings, provided some rare deadline drama. On Oct. 6, just as we were putting the finishing touches on the interview for the Oct. 16 issue, I got an e-mail from Netflix with the subject line ""URGENT."" If the magazine ran the interview with Hastings as planned, The New York Times would look ""foolish."" My contact refused to offer me any specifics about what was afoot, but he said I would understand early the following week. He was good on his word. The initial interview - in which Hastings provided his justification for spinning off the disc-only service of his company into Qwikster - would have made us look pretty dopey had we published almost a week after Netflix announced that it was ditching Qwikster altogether. So we quickly put moved up our Melissa McCarthy interview to run in Hastings's place. Hastings talked to me three days after the Qwikster mercy killing and I drew the entirety of this week's column from that one interview. But here's one exchange from that earlier interview that's worth rescuing."

2011-10-21T06:00:50Z,"Colts (0-6) at Saints (4-2)Sunday, 8:20 p.m.Line: Saints by 14.The famous quote by the former N.F.L. commissioner Bert Bell - ""On any given Sunday, any team in the N.F.L. can beat any other"" - has been a source of reassurance for both fans and television programmers for decades. The league's carefully maintained competitive balance almost guarantees that every week will feature several compelling games between high-quality, evenly matched opponents. Almost.Bell would never imagine a week like this, in which the best (the Patriots) and most fascinating (the Eagles, the 49ers) teams have byes, while the top contenders face pushovers and the mediocre slug it out with the middling. Matchups that looked good when the schedule was announced now merit double-digit point spreads. Case in point: the Colts vs. the Saints, a rematch of Super Bowl XLIV that promised to be a seesaw offensive battle, is now little more than a three-hour wake for Indianapolis and a chance to watch Sean Payton coach New Orleans from the booth instead of the sideline.Granted, Curtis Painter, like a frozen burrito under a filling station heat lamp, is slowly warming to the Colts' starting quarterback job. His completion percentage has gone up every week, and the Colts offense no longer looks like an intramural team playing in a downpour. Also, Drew Brees offered hope that Payton might find a way to stand on, or slightly above, the field on the surgically repaired leg he broke in last week's game. ""I'm envisioning some kind of hovercraft on the sideline,"" Brees said. Levitating coaches: another thing that Bert Bell could never imagine. Pick: Saints."

2011-10-21T00:00:00Z,"MCGINTY--John Edward. September 24, 1946 - October 14, 2011. John E. McGinty, a senior advisor in the investment banking department of UBS, died at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, MA on Friday, October 14 of complications of multiple myeloma. He was 65 years old. Born in St. Louis and educated at Northwestern University and the University of Chicago, McGinty began his career in 1970 at the boutique New York City investment firm of H.C. Wainwright, training with John Suydam as a machinery analyst in a revered research department. Wainwright was acquired by Weeden & Co. and in 1977, when the company closed its doors, McGinty moved to First Boston in the same role. He continued as a managing director when First Boston was acquired by Credit Suisse, providing coverage based on, in some cases, relationships that extended over three decades. Ranked by Institutional Investor magazine among the top machinery analysts in 31 of his 33 years in the industry (occasionally in more than one category), McGinty became the centerpiece of the firm's global effort in machinery. He was a voice of enthusiasm in the research department and a willing mentor to younger analysts, an uncommon trait on Wall Street. He retired from Credit Suisse in November 2006 and moved to UBS as a senior advisor in investment banking. A strong believer in education, McGinty served as a trustee to Salve Regina University, was an active alumnus of Chicago Booth, and contributed to initiatives at Milton Academy, the Rivers School, the investment committee of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, Goddard House in Brookline, MA, and Trinity Church Boston. He also established the first girls town soccer league in Montclair, NJ. An avid golfer and devoted family member, he is survived by five sisters, his wife of 40 years, Sarah Myers, and three children, John, Sarah, and William, all of Boston, MA. Funeral service and reception will be held at Trinity Church Copley Square Boston at 10am on October 22. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the John E. McGinty history chair at Salve Regina University c/o the Office of the President, 100 Ochre Point Ave., Newport, RI 02840."

Mr. Crowe begins with the period leading up to the group's formation (it is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year), the chaos the resulted not long after its rise to stardom and its step back from center stage. Among those interviewed are the band members (above, from left) Mike McCready, Matt Cameron, Eddie Vedder, Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard, as well as the Soundgarden singer and guitarist Chris Cornell.

Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said: ''In the end what elevates Mr. Hou's films to the sublime -- and this one comes close at times -- are not the stories but their telling. In 'Flight of the Red Balloon' Mr. Hou plays with light and space on the small canvas that is Simon and Suzanne's apartment, moving the camera around as gracefully as if it were a brush (or a balloon).''"

So try to sound surprised when you learn that there are a couple of unexpected twists to the character that Ms. Sevigny plays in her latest project, at least one of which is strongly hinted at in its title. In ''Hit and Miss,'' a new series that will be shown on the satellite service DirecTV, she portrays a character named Mia who is a hired assassin as well as a pre-op transsexual. When Mia learns she's had a son by an ex-girlfriend who is dying of cancer, she is forced ''to mix her killer instincts with her newly acquired maternal ones'' (hey, that's what it says in the press release). ''Hit and Miss'' is created by Paul Abbott, whose previous series include the British programs ''Cracker,'' ''State of Play'' and ''Shameless'' (which was adapted for American viewers on the cable channel Showtime). DirecTV said on Friday that it would show ''Hit or Miss'' next year on its Audience Network, though an exact debut date remains - what else? - a secret."

What follows is some horrifying violence at the same time that the area is terrorized by a serial killer. Owen assumes that the culprit behind the gruesome deeds is Abby's father, trying to fulfill his daughter's craving for blood. But the poor man botches his mission a lot of the time. And that gives Abby (and the film's director, Matt Reeves) ''a chance to show off some creepy computer-aided monster skills,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this ''worthy and honorable remake of 'Let the Right One In,' Tomas Alfredson's Swedish adaptation of the novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist.'' Mr. Scott added: ''The story holds a few surprises, but what makes 'Let Me In' so eerily fascinating is the mood it creates.

The emergency measure places these substances -- mephedrone, methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) and methylone -- under the D.E.A.'s most restrictive category for at least a year, while they study whether they should be permanently banned. This classification is reserved for substances with high potential for abuse and no accepted use under medical supervision. These products, sometimes called plant food, are sold under names like Bliss, Purple Wave, Vanilla Sky and Ivory Wave. Though not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for consumption, they have become increasingly popular, especially among teenagers and young adults, the D.E.A. said. ''These chemicals pose a direct and significant threat, regardless of how they are marketed, and we will aggressively pursue those who attempt their manufacture and sale,'' Michele M. Leonhart, the agency's administrator, said in a statement. The longterm effects are unknown but the D.E.A. considers them ''potentially severe.''"

When a kickoff travels out of bounds between the goal lines, the receiving team can elect to take the ball 25 yards, not 30 yards, from the spot of the kick. On a standard kickoff from the 35-yard line, the receiving team would take possession at its 40-yard line, not its 35-yard line.

Two leading producers, Disney Theatrical Productions and the British impresario Sonia Friedman, have been holding meetings with the playwright Tom Stoppard - who shared an original screenplay Oscar for ''Shakespeare in Love'' with Marc Norman - and the director Jack O'Brien about the project, according to theater executives familiar with the creative discussions. The new version would be a straight play, an exception to the movie-to-stage trend; most films these days are turned into musicals, most recently ''Catch Me If You Can,'' ''Ghost,'' ''Priscilla Queen of the Desert,'' and ''Sister Act.'' Mr. Stoppard and Mr. O'Brien are long-time collaborators on plays: They won Tony Awards -- for best play and best director -- in 2007 for Mr. Stoppard's Russian-history drama ''The Coast of Utopia,'' and they were both Tony nominees in 2001 for ''The Invention of Love.''"

Traditional craft, like Edith Heath's pottery or Sam Maloof's furniture, is displayed alongside Modernist industrial designs using innovative postwar materials. The exhibition's showstopper is a re-creation of the living room of Charles and Ray Eames's house, Case Study House No. 8, for which the Eames Foundation lent hundreds of objects, providing a glimpse into the designing couple's private world.

Muammar el-Qaddafi -- serious, dryly funny -- that contains the observation that the Libyan leader looked like ''a parody of Sixties radical chic.'' It was those craggy features and retro blue-tinted shades. Colonel Qaddafi was no joke, but we once laughed (as the obituary noted) at his outlandishness. For a trip in 2002, to South Africa, his entourage consisted of a personal jet, two transport planes, a container ship filled with buses and goat meat, $6 million in petty cash and 400 security guards. Well, no more. Although some quarters of the fashion world continue to plead for a frivolousness that seems as naff as those blue shades (let's face it, we have a lot of old-school designers who haven't seen the light), there are small signs of sanity. Or so I like to think."

He was offered a new rent of $3,590 for a one-year lease; it was not ''more than $5,000 a month.'' (The information about the increase was supplied to The Times by Mr. Graney. Efforts to reach his landlord, Durst Fetner Residential, to confirm his account in advance of publication were unsuccessful.)"
2011-10-23T00:00:00Z,"An article last Sunday about airstrikes believed to have been carried out by American drones in Yemen on Oct. 14 attributed an erroneous distinction to an American killed in the attack. The American, Abdelrahman al-Awlaki, was at least the fourth American killed in such a strike, not the third. The others include his father, Anwar al-Awlaki, a Qaeda propagandist killed last month; Samir Khan, the editor of Al Qaeda's online magazine, who was killed in the same strike as the elder Mr. Awlaki, and Kamal Derwish, believed to be the leader of a group of Qaeda recruits from Lackawanna, N.Y., who was killed in November 2002."
2011-10-23T00:00:00Z,"THERE they go again, stealing the spotlight from their cowed and embittered progeny, the unforgivable but unforgettable monsters Mom and Dad. These Freudian demons have been showing up all over the place for ages, in recurring nightmares, best-selling memoirs and novels and, perhaps most deliciously, onstage. ''Ready or not, here comes Momma!'' Rose yells in ''Gypsy,'' that sharp-needled evergreen from 1959 and probably the greatest musical of all time. It makes sense that Rose, one of the fiercest and most flamboyant examples of the theater's cannibal parents, is a tiger stage mother and a thwarted actress. In the final scene she says to her daughter Louise (who works under the stage name of Gypsy Rose Lee), ''I guess I did do it for me.'' When Louise asks why, Rose answers, ''Just wanted to be noticed.''"

2011-10-23T00:00:00Z,"Colts (0-6) at Saints (4-2) Sunday, 8:20 p.m. Line: Saints by 14. The famous quote by the former N.F.L. commissioner Bert Bell - ''On any given Sunday, any team in the N.F.L. can beat any other'' - has been a source of reassurance for both fans and television programmers for decades. The league's carefully maintained competitive balance almost guarantees that every week will feature several compelling games between high-quality, evenly matched opponents. Almost. Bell would never imagine a week like this, in which the best (the Patriots) and most fascinating (the Eagles, the 49ers) teams have byes, while the top contenders face pushovers and the mediocre slug it out with the middling. Matchups that looked good when the schedule was announced now merit double-digit point spreads. Case in point: the Colts vs. the Saints, a rematch of Super Bowl XLIV that promised to be a seesaw offensive battle, is now little more than a three-hour wake for Indianapolis and a chance to watch Sean Payton coach New Orleans from the booth instead of the sideline. Granted, Curtis Painter, like a frozen burrito under a filling station heat lamp, is slowly warming to the Colts' starting quarterback job. His completion percentage has gone up every week, and the Colts offense no longer looks like an intramural team playing in a downpour. Also, Drew Brees offered hope that Payton might find a way to stand on, or slightly above, the field on the surgically repaired leg he broke in last week's game. ''I'm envisioning some kind of hovercraft on the sideline,'' Brees said. Levitating coaches: another thing that Bert Bell could never imagine. Pick: Saints. Bears (3-3) at Buccaneers (4-2) in London Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Bears by 1. The Buccaneers rookie defender Adrian Clayborn tried fish and chips for the first time as soon as Tampa Bay arrived in London on Monday. ''It didn't sit well with me at all,'' Clayborn told The Tampa Tribune. ''It messed up my stomach bad.'' Do not let Clayborn anywhere near steak and kidney pie. You would think that most Americans have encountered fish and chips by now, and conversely, that most Britons would be able to differentiate a football team worthy of international acclaim from, say, the Bears. However, Lovie Smith (whose Bears stayed in the United States until Thursday) expects something close to a home-field advantage. ''I'm told we have a big following overseas,'' Smith said, not realizing that many Londoners are still expecting to see William (The Refrigerator) Perry. Smith does not expect his Bears to be jet-lagged, any more than Raheem Morris expects his players to be cramped up from too much bangers and mash. Smith also hopes to win some new fans. ''I know the guys are excited about showing our brand of football over there,'' he said. The Bears brand includes Jay Cutler's occasionally uttering profanities, heard by a microphone, about the coordinator Mike Martz. Though if you really want to hear Cutler swear, get him to try bubble and squeak. Pick: Buccaneers."

Father Dean Brackley, S.J.,who joined the faculty at the University of Central America after six of his fellow Jesuits were killed at the height of El Salvador civil war, died of pancreatic and liver cancer October 16. He was 82. Originally a member of the Jesuits' New York province, Father Brackley joined the university's theology faculty after the 1989 murder of the Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daughter by Salvadoran military troops. An upstate New York native, Father Brackley was working as an educator at Fordham University and as a community organizer in Manhattan's Lower East Side when he offered to move to San Salvador. There, he administered the University of Central America's School for Religious Education from 1990 to 1996 and assisted in the work of schools for pastoral formation sponsored by the university. He also hosted numerous delegations of students from Jesuit universities, church leaders and journalists from the United States and elsewhere. He worked tirelessly for human rights and social justice in El Salvador. Father Brackley entered the Society of Jesus in 1964 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1976. He earned his doctorate in religious social ethics from the University of Chicago Divinity School in 1980. Early in his ministry he worked as a community organizer in the South Bronx, where he experienced the difficulties faced by people living in poor communities. Father Brackley was presented with an honorary doctorate of religious studies by Marquette University. He also served as a trustee of The University of San Francisco, where a scholarship for Latino students was established in his name, from 2003 until his death. The wake, funeral and burial for Fr. Brackley were all held in San Salvador. The funeral was at the chapel at the University of Central America."

He was always the life of the party and loved music and the theater. He will be terribly missed by his brother Marc, sister-in-law Barbara and his longtime companion Iris Berman. His nephews, John and Adam, and niece Helenbeth Reynolds and their spouses Meryl, Sheri and John and children, Jill, David, Spencer, Michael, Jennifer, Michael Raye and Ryan will also terribly miss him but will always remember him."

But it's not just a road: it's a crocodilian slalom course. As I jolted along in a rented Fiat Uno on a late August night, my headlights caught the glare of dozens of red eyes staring in the near pitch-black far ahead. They belonged to Yacare caimans, alligator cousins that had decided the road was a comfortable resting spot."

2011-10-23T00:00:00Z,"WHEN it comes to selling cars, few advertising boasts are more cherished than the claim to being first. For an automaker to declare that its car is first with a new feature is to proclaim inventiveness, boldness and exclusivity, all in a single word. Chevrolet has only rarely been the leader in this pursuit. It was not first with electric starters (that was Cadillac, in 1912) nor did it pioneer the use of turbochargers (Oldsmobile was an early adopter, in the 1960s). This was no accident: General Motors let its higher-priced brands introduce the breakthroughs. Chevy was the value brand."

2011-10-23T00:00:00Z,"CHEVROLET may be celebrating its centennial, but along with the century's highlights are missteps too glaring to be ignored. The 1917 Model D, for instance, was powered -- barely -- by a 288-cubic-inch overhead-valve V-8 that wheezed out 36 horsepower. It was short-lived, but at least it ran, unlike the 1923 ''copper-cooled'' 4-cylinder models, which used copper fins instead of water passages to inadequately cool its 135 cubic inches. Production was halted after five months, and all were recalled."

Several blocks of another protected bike lane, to be built on Jackson Avenue west of the city's Loop, and sections of the Bloomingdale Trail, a two-and-a-half-long park to be built on an abandoned rail line from Wicker Park to Humboldt Park, will also be in low-income areas."
2011-10-23T00:00:00Z,"WRAPPING an American flag around a brand has long been a popular way to peddle products -- to Americans, certainly, and sometimes to citizens of other countries (say, Coca-Cola and Levi's). In this country, no other automobile line -- and few brands of any kind -- have been as successful as Chevrolet with flag-waving pitches. After years of unmemorable advertising slogans like ''Eye it, try it, buy it,'' the brand struck pay dirt with the theme ''See the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet,'' as promulgated through a catchy jingle that became identified with the singer Dinah Shore after she sang it in two Chevy-sponsored television series that ran from 1951 to 1963."

Boehm was born in Germany and was educated in France, receiving his first doctorate in law from the University of Dijon in 1937. That same year, he emigrated to the United States and worked in Alabama as a High School teacher of French, Latin and Social Studies. He attended Tulane University starting in 1939 and earned a Master's degree in Social Work in 1941. Before beginning his long and illustrious career in social work education, Boehm worked in social welfare agencies in Boston and New York, and also served in the U.S. Army. After WWII, he taught at the University of Wisconsin, the University of Minnesota, and came to Rutgers University where he served as Dean of the School of Social Work from 1963-1972. During his tenure as Dean, Dr. Boehm brought the School to national prominence by adding the bachelor and doctoral programs in Social Work. At the conclusion of his Deanship, he served as Director for the Center for International Cooperative Social Welfare at Rutgers University from 1973 to 1981. He continued to lecture in France and Germany through 1985, devoting his last professional activity to preparing Social Work for the challenges of the future. Dr. Boehm enjoyed a varied and highly respected career as a practitioner, academic administrator, and scholar, and for almost half a century he provided leadership to Social Work education. He is best known for having directed a landmark study on Social Work curriculum development for the Council on Social Work Education from 1955-1960. Many of the findings and recommendations of that Study have relevance for Social Work education in the new millennium. In addition to his books, monographs, and more than one hundred papers, Dr. Boehm served as Editor of the Journal of International Social Work and the Harper and Row Social Work series. He also served as a Social Work Specialist for the U.S. State Department, providing consultation to the United Nations in the U.S., Europe and South America. Dr. Boehm was the recipient of many awards and honors, including a Fulbright award (1969), the Rutgers Medal (1983), the National Association of Social Work's Social Worker of the Year (1983), an honorary doctorate from the Tulane University School of Social Work (1992) and the Council on Social Work Education's Significant Lifetime Achievement award (1995). Dr. Boehm is survived by his current wife Laurie H. Boehm of New Brunswick, NJ, his brother Dr. Eric Boehm of Santa Barbara, California, his nephews Ronald and Steven Boehm of Santa Barbara, California, and his cousins Harold and Millicent May of Englewood Cliffs, NJ and Hilde and Gunter Hahn of Sao Paulo, Brazil. His previous wife, Dr. Bernice Boehm, died in 1983 and their son, Andrew Boehm, died in 2010.

2011-10-23T00:00:00Z,"Twitter serves many purposes -- meme manufacturing, revolution aggregation, troll facilitation -- but it also functions as a real-time discussion board for the things we see on television. And every time something major happens on a program that a lot of us love, the progression of tweets is predictable. First, the nonspecific expressions of shock. (''OMG BREAKING BAD :0.'') Then the rush to make a trenchant if vague joke. (''Gus sure was sporting a Harvey Dent look!'') Then the broader, spoiler-filled discussion of the twist. (''Someone better make a GIF of Gus straightening his tie before he falls down dead.'') Then, of course, the angry accusations of spoiler-mongering. A few years ago, in the pre-Twitter era, I wrote a long blog post outlining the etiquette of online spoilers. My argument was simple: if you love ''The Wire'' so much that you'd be angry to find out who died before the DVDs are released, then pony up for HBO. Twitter only solidified this rationale. You would not expect, for example, your friends to avoid tweeting about the death of Steve Jobs out of respect for the fact that you had not yet read the newspaper."

2011-10-23T00:00:00Z,"CHESS has an intellectual pedigree, but as played on the streets of New York City by a small army of hustlers, it is a game unto itself -- a gritty pastime and a way to scratch out a living. Hustling chess has a long tradition in the city, but no one knows who started it. In the 1960s and '70s, a man named Bobby Haywood used to park his board on a garbage can at Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street and stand in front of it in a threadbare fur coat, taking on all comers. Many of the hustlers are black; some are immigrants. There are silent assassins who utter hardly a word as they dispatch their opponents, and there are boisterous, native New Yorkers, adept at the quick insult, who exult with each victory. Some players are genial, others project a slight air of menace. The players are cagey about just how much they win, but some will admit to taking home $50 to $75 a day."

Press, where Mr. McNairy was formerly the creative director, have made their way into an eclectic mix of closets, traditional and trendy. When it was announced this summer that Mr. McNairy would introduce a complete line of subversive-preppy clothes and accessories for men in the spring, all those fans cheered. And now, it's official: he's doing women's wear, too. Inspired by his daughter, Daisy, the 50-piece collection is charmingly boyish, but (very McNairy) sexily so, with oxford shirts paired with boyfriend boxers and rugby tanks over miniskirts. There are echoes of some of the men's line motifs: a daisy print, an exploded camouflage and a floral-on-plaid shirt. ''Basically, I make women's clothes from a guy's point of view,'' Mr. McNairy said. ''It has nothing to do with fashion.''

2011-10-23T00:00:00Z,"CHEVROLET, which celebrates its 100th birthday next month, has woven itself deeply into the fabric of America. Its Impalas dropped us off at school. Its pickup trucks hauled our produce on the farm. Its Corvette sustained our sports car fantasies through the boredom of high school algebra class. Earlier than almost any other automotive brand, Chevy created a palette of vehicles that ranged from the small and thrifty to the sleek and sporty to the large and smartly trimmed. Once the model line expanded beyond the limited body selections of its first half-century, there was a Chevy for almost everyone. The brand's broad appeal resulted in a place atop the sales charts starting in the 1930s and continuing nearly uncontested for decades. By the mid-1960s Chevrolet sold nearly threemillion cars and light-duty trucks a year.But there's more to the story than commercial success. Although it occupied the first rung of Alfred P. Sloan's General Motors hierarchy, a ladder on which customers would move up to more expensive brands as they gained affluence, Chevy developed a following of fans whose devotion lasted a lifetime. After decades of decline, Chevrolet has lately had a resurgence with its Cruze and Malibu sedans, the reinvented Camaro and the Volt, the first mass-produced plug-in hybrid. The full Chevrolet story has filled volumes. Here are some ofthe highlights of the 100-year journey."

2011-10-24T11:00:31Z,"Ten years is the length of an average commercial lease, but it's also, as the designer Ted Muehling has discovered, the approximate life span of a neighborhood. Back in 2001, Muehling moved his storefront workshop from a formerly desolate block on Greene Street to Howard Street - at the time SoHo's final frontier. But when a Mondrian hotel went up nearby, so did Muehling's rent, and the designer moved on once again. His new store, on White Street in TriBeCa, is grander in proportion and there is more selling space, but also more space for Muehling to display the many things he collects and that inspire him, from natural wonders like seashells or insects to the work of his partner, the artist Mats Gustafson, or that of his friend Jan Baracz, who carves bellybuttons into large stones. And while his workrooms are smaller, for the first time Muehling has a little studio all his own - an ""attic"" tucked into a mezzanine under a skylight in the back. The timing could not have been better. With his product collaborations with Nymphenburg and Steuben winding down, Muehling is eager to get back to making jewelry. On a recent morning, a pair of canaries twittered joyfully, and an installation of monarch butterflies on a dried mullein stem was magically animated by a breeze from the air-conditioner. As with his previous store, this one is livened by sounds from behind the scenes - the bang of metal on metal, the murmur of NPR - evidence that this is a place where things are made and not just sold. It's the kind of neighborhood place, Muehling points out, where you can walk in and they'll make a new wire for your earring if you don't mind waiting 20 minutes."

2011-10-24T10:00:43Z,"In 1948, the architect and inventor Buckminster Fuller gathered a group of his students at Black Mountain College to build a life-size geodesic dome. The dome was a flop. It succeeded, however, in planting the seed for the sculptor Kenneth Snelson, a student of Fuller's, to develop the principle of tensegrity that would allow Fuller to build a dome for the United States Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal. For the Performa 11 biennial (11.performa-arts.org), the Los Angeles artist Liz Glynn will retrace Fuller's steps, pratfalls and all. Part 1 of her performance - a loosely choreographed re-enactment of Fuller's failed attempt - takes place on the first Sunday of the biennial in locations throughout New York City, including Times Square; for Part 2, 25 volunteers will assist in building a dome. Whether it will stand remains to be seen. But Glynn's cast-concrete dome sculptures (above), on view at the Performa Hub through Nov. 21, are objects of perfection of which even Fuller might have approved."

2011-10-24T00:00:00Z,"KEY PERFORMANCE Each successive solid game by receiver Jeremy Kerley makes it hard to believe he barely played the first month of the season. Eclipsed by the since-departed Derrick Mason in September, Kerley has emerged as a favorite target of Mark Sanchez, who found him twice on third down on the Jets' first scoring drive of the second half. Both conversions came with the Jets needing at least 5 yards for the first down. Kerley finished with a career-high four receptions for 29 yards. NOTABLE NUMBER Toward the end of the game, linebacker Calvin Pace glanced at the scoreboard and, reading Philip Rivers's passing statistics, knew the Jets' defense had clamped down. Rivers threw for only 179 yards, his fewest in 22 regular-season games since Jan. 3, 2010. The Jets had only one sack, in the first quarter, but their pass rush pressured Rivers for much of the game. Their secondary held Vincent Jackson, a dangerous receiver, without a catch in the second half."

2011-10-24T00:00:00Z,"North American moviegoers were in the mood to be scared over the weekend, powering the micro-budgeted ''Paranormal Activity 3'' to a stronger-than-anticipated $54 million in ticket sales. That total, easily enough for No. 1, prompted Paramount Pictures, the studio behind this wildly successful horror franchise, to shriek with delight, or at least superlatives. (According to Paramount, the opening weekend total for ''Paranormal Activity 3,'' which cost just $5 million to make, is the biggest in history for a horror film -- not accounting for inflation.) The studio partly attributed strong sales to strikingly positive reviews, which helped draw more moviegoers in their 30s and 40s. ''Real Steel'' (DreamWorks) was second with about $11.3 million in ticket sales for a three-week total of $67 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. ''Footloose'' (Paramount) was third, taking in a solid $10.9 million in its second weekend for a new total of $30.9 million. A 3-D version of ''The Three Musketeers'' (Summit Entertainment) arrived with a thud in fourth place and $8.8 million in ticket sales. Summit, which acquired distribution rights to ''Musketeers'' from its financier, Constantin Film, came under fire on Twitter on Friday from Milla Jovovich, the film's female lead, for botching the marketing; Summit executives privately dismissed the notion but did not comment publicly. ''The Ides of March'' (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was fifth, taking in about $4.9 million for a three-week total of $29.2 million."

2011-10-25T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (ESPN) THE REAL ROCKY In 1975 Chuck Wepner, the 6-foot-5 boxer known as the Bayonne Bleeder for his New Jersey hometown and for the pummeling he sustained at the fists of Sonny Liston, went up against Muhammad Ali for the heavyweight title and a potential purse of $100,000. (Ali would win $1.5 million.) Wepner, above, knocked Ali down in the ninth round, stunning the crowd; in the remaining rounds Ali opened cuts above Wepner's eyes, broke his nose and, with 19 seconds remaining in the 15th round, knocked him down, winning the bout. Watching it all was a young Sylvester Stallone, who was inspired to write the script for, and eventually star in, ''Rocky'' (1976), which won three Academy Awards, including best picture. Jeff Feuerzeig (''The Devil and Daniel Johnston'') chronicles the life and times of Wepner, now a liquor salesman who drives a Cadillac with vanity plates that read ''Champ.'' 5:20 P.M. (Starz) THE YOUNG VICTORIA (2009) Emily Blunt portrays a decidedly unfrumpy Queen Victoria as a teenage monarch; Miranda Richardson is her mother, the Duchess of Kent, who would gladly pull the puppet strings; and Rupert Friend is Albert, Victoria's first cousin and the eventual love of her life. ''Despite the filmmakers' efforts to persuade us that 'The Young Victoria' is a serious work, and despite some tense moments and gunfire, the movie's pleasures are as light as its story,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this ''frivolously entertaining film,'' directed by Jean-Marc Vallée and written by Julian Fellowes. ''No matter. Albert may never rip Victoria's bodice, but he does eventually loosen it, to her delight and ours.''"

In a recent interview with Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times, Mr. Lopez talked about the team's creative process: ''To hear them say how they do it, they're always out of ideas, and they're always looking around for crumbs.

(Cinemax) WALL STREET (1987) Oliver Stone chronicles shifting fortunes in the financial world in this double bill, which begins with his drama about a young stockbroker (Charlie Sheen) willing to do anything to make it to the top, and his ruthless, corporation-raiding mentor, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas). In its sequel, ''Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps'' (2010), at 10, Mr. Douglas returns as the reptilian Gekko, who, after serving an eight-year prison sentence, has landed in the public spotlight once again for writing a critical and prescient book about the state of the markets. Shia LaBeouf is the investment banker Jake Moore, one of Gekko's fans, and the live-in love of Gekko's estranged daughter (Carey Mulligan). Frank Langella is the old-school broker who has been like a father to Jake. And Josh Brolin is the newest snake in town. Let the games resume.

2011-10-26T00:00:00Z,"Last week, I wrote that the monster passing numbers from the first five weeks took a serious body blow in Week 6, evidenced by a huge decline in passing touchdowns. The knockout punch was delivered in Week 7. After teams averaged over 240 passing yards per game through the first six weeks of the season, the 26 teams playing in Week 7 combined for only 4,997 passing yards this past weekend, a paltry 191 yards per game. Nowhere was this more evident -- on Sunday -- than in Cleveland, as the Seahawks and Browns put on a pitiful display. The Browns and Seahawks combined for 435 yards and 9 points. It was the worst display of offense in a game not affected by severe weather in over a decade. The Colt McCoypass attempt watch marches on: he threw 35 passes in a game in which the Browns allowed only 137 yards and 3 points. But Cleveland-Seattle was just an appetizer for ''Monday Night Football.'' Against Jacksonville, the Ravens' first 22 plays netted 6 yards. Baltimore had nine drives in the first half, and the Ravens never got close to getting a first down on any of them. Four of Jacksonville's first-half possessions gained negative yards; a fifth series ended in a fumble. After 30 minutes, the game featured five fumbles, four first downs and just 29 yards of passing. Baltimore got its first first down with five minutes left in the third quarter. The two teams combined for 185 passing yards, the fewest in any game this season. Joe Flacco threw for only 137 yards on 38 pass attempts; only Jesse Palmer, Bobby Hoying, Kent Graham, Carson Palmer and Tommy Maddox have gained fewer yards on so many attempts since 1970. The Jaguars rookie quarterback Blaine Gabbert wasn't any better -- the Jaguars gained 73 passing yards on 24 pass plays. Once again, don't write the obituary on pass defense just yet."

Usually Broadway has two, maybe three breakout hits among plays each fall, in large part because of the popular appeal of well-known actors in the cast.

''The Past is finally cremated,'' he says. ''I feel reborn, I tell you.'' ''Exorcism'' premiered at the Provincetown Playhouse in March, 1920, but O'Neill then abruptly withdrew the play and destroyed what were believed to be all the copies. What scholars knew of the work came from mostly the details in a review in The New York Times by Alexander Woollcott, who wrote that ''Exorcism'' was ''uncommonly good.''"

2011-10-27T00:00:00Z,"CARPENTER--Ruth C. A teacher, mentor, literary scholar and friend of unparalleled intellect and generosity, Ruth Corn Carpenter, of New Milford, Connecticut and New York City, passed away peacefully on the evening of October 23, 2011. Only child of Lorlene Johnson and Wilbur Graves Corn, Ruth grew up in Franklin, Tennessee, and attended The Harpeth Hall School, where she was valedictorian. She was graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1957 with a B.A. in English, first in her class and summa cum laude. Among other honors, she was awarded Marshall and Fulbright scholarships, and studied at Cambridge University in England, where she received an M.A. She also won Bryn Mawr's European Fellowship, the college's highest honor for a member of the graduating class. Ruth then began a 50-year career studying and teaching literature. Many of her students have described her as the most brilliant mind and greatest teacher they have ever encountered in any field at any institution. She taught briefly at Barnard College, and in South Korea at Ewha Women's University, but primarily lavished her great literary and pedagogical gifts on the girls of the Brearley School in New York City, where she taught for 40 years, and where she was the guiding star of an English department that rivaled any in the country. Ruth opened the minds of thousands of Brearley girls to the abiding value of literature. She taught everything from Malory to Jane Austen to Samuel Beckett to Langston Hughes, but Shakespeare was her first love, literally. At the age of 12, she saw a traveling production of Hamlet in Franklin, Tennessee, and suddenly she ""was in love"" -- simultaneously with the red headed actor playing the lead, with Hamlet and with Shakespeare. It was to Ruth's Shakespeare elective that the students of Brearley flocked every year, and it was to Shakespeare that she primarily devoted her luminous attention after retiring from the Brearley School in 2000. From 2000 through 2011, Ruth was the head of adult education at, and taught Shakespeare seminars for, the Shakespeare Society in New York City. Like generations of Brearley girls, Ruth's adult students became enthralled by Ruth's remarkable ability to deepen, complicate and expand their understanding of, and feeling for, the fully formed characters we meet in Shakespeare's plays. Ruth Carpenter offered to all her students, young and old, a new way of comprehending Shakespeare, the world and themselves. That is the essence of her legacy to us all. She would have us continue to regard Shakespeare with new eyes; and to those who protest they cannot do that without her she would say (quoting readily from The Winter's Tale), ""It is required you do awake your faith."" Ruth was a radiant spirit and a devout humanist who also firmly believed in the immortality of the soul. Her enormously generous heart, a lifetime devoted to seeing human beings fully, in life as in literature, and her linguistic brilliance made her at once a wise and compassionate friend, and a wonderfully witty one too. The entire English language was at her command, and her grip on it never failed. Moreover, the invariable elegance of her attire matched the elegance of her mind, and we will rarely see her like again for sartorial perfection. For Ruth, as for Shakespeare, ""nothing human was alien to her,"" and her sheer love of life and her friends rivaled that of her beloved Falstaff. She also made friends with bats and snakes and blue jays and geese and all the denizens of her Connecticut gardens that were a source of endless pleasure. Ruth now joins her loving partner of 20 years, Dick Gershman, who died in 1998. Ruth is survived by the love of her best friends Alexa and Fred Aldridge, Ann McDonald and Ellie Rittman, and by the love and devotion of all the Aldridges, who are her godchildren and family: Mindy Aldridge and her daughter, Katharine, and Richard and Kris Aldridge, and their children Hank, Eliza, Bo and Evie. Ruth's funeral will be private. A memorial service will be held in New York City, the details of which will be announced. Ruth asked that, in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the Shakespeare Society, 118-122 Baxter Street, Suite 705, New York, New York 10013."

2011-10-27T00:00:00Z,"Orange alert! The Department of Homeland Security may have retired its color-coded terrorism alert system, but the pervading sense of paranoia that it represented isn't going away, and neither is Showtime's hit series, ''Homeland.'' On Wednesday that cable channel said it had ordered a second season of ''Homeland,'' its serialized thriller about a dogged if possibly paranoid C.I.A. officer (played by Claire Danes), a recently released American prisoner of war (Damian Lewis) who may be a sleeper agent for Al Qaeda, and Mandy Patinkin's epic beard. (O.K., the beard is not as crucial to the story, but some of us still find it fascinating.) The series, which is adapted from Gideon Raff's Israeli television program ''Prisoners of War'' and is produced by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa (both of ''24''), has been Showtime's highest-rated first-year drama series since making its debut earlier this month, and is drawing about 1 million viewers for each new broadcast. Showtime said that production on a new 12-episode season of ''Homeland'' would begin next spring, giving Ms. Danes's character plenty of time to refill her illicit supply of Klonopin."

At Chloé, a patchwork sweater was shown with loose-fitting leather pants (wide-leg jeans or trousers would look cool, too). And at Altuzarra, an argyle pullover read dressed-up/casual with a military-inflected pencil skirt and puffy jacket.

Gotham City is overrun with mobsters, and the colorful freaks that make up the hero's rogues gallery are just starting to emerge. The mystery, originally told over 13 issues, centers around a murderer named Holiday, who strikes on a special day each month - whether it's Christmas, Mother's Day or Independence Day.

But long before teams arrived at the barely completed Buddh International Circuit on Thursday, they prepared for the grand prix, scheduled for Oct. 30, the same way they did for the first-ever Korean Grand Prix last year and the first-ever Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2009: They ran laps in the simulator."

2011-10-28T11:41:55Z,"After the Rangers lost their home opener, 4-2, to Toronto Thursday night, Coach John Tortorella said his team was mentally and physically lethargic. This may be true, but there could be another reason why they have spent so much of the early part of this season chasing the puck around the rink. Tortorella's team is hardly a collection of fleet skaters."
2011-10-28T11:25:09Z,"Thursday night was the Fashion Group's annual party, at Cipriani Wall Street, a journey of 1,000 miles (it seemed). Everyone was packed into the former bank, unaware that in an hour or so we were going to be served this large, brown, rectangular hunk of ground lamb with a side of scalloped potatoes. I had just come from celebrating the season with a pumpkin pie bake-off at the office, so the lamb thing was a definite freakout, a no-go. Raf Simons, one of the evening's honorees, made a tidy joke at the podium about the gravy stain on his tie. Awards were also given to Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte, Giambattista Valli, Andrew Rosen, Daphne Guinness, Lauren Bush and Wanda Ferragamo. Steve Sadove, the chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, and Ronald Frasch, the store's president, were the designated ""superstars,"" with Mr. Frasch making a funny speech about golf, competition and why he loves his job."
2011-10-28T11:15:47Z,"It isn't every day that Tel Aviv gets a piece of architecture worth writing home about. In fact, one of the easiest arguments to win in the Middle East might be that Tel Aviv's urban core has not sprouted a truly remarkable structure in the more than half a century since the Bauhaus inkwell - which left its curvilinear imprint on hundreds of buildings in ""The White City"" - began to dry up. But with the completion of the Herta and Paul Amir Building at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, opening on Wednesday, things are set to get noticeably whiter and brighter. The new wing, designed by the Cambridge, Mass.-based architect Preston Scott Cohen (who is also chairman of the architecture department at Harvard University), looks a bit like an elongated Rubik's Cube doused with bleach. The gleaming white parabolas of the facade are composed of 465 flat, interlocking, precast concrete panels of different shapes and sizes. The building's three floors are linked to two more below grade by an 87-foot-high, top-lit atrium, a ""lightfall"" that will shine on the world's largest collection of Israeli art. The building's confident yet supple geometries provide a nifty counterpoint to the museum's main building, a 1971 Brutalist number by the Israeli architect Dan Eytan (who also designed Israel's decidedly unfussy Dimona nuclear reactor). Next to that chunky monkey, Cohen's creation is pure pizazz. Fittingly, in honor of the building's inauguration later this month, the city of Tel Aviv has declared 2012 to be Art Year, culminating in a four-day blowout Art Weekend March 21-24."

Extensive studies clearly indicate that drugs cause more trouble for racehorses and their riders than they alleviate. Lasix jurisdictions have significantly more breakdowns than jurisdictions where Lasix is not allowed. No prerace Lasix means no attending veterinarians with loaded syringes in the stall injecting the horses with drugs hours before they run. The dangerous and dubious charade of medicating racehorses before they compete is coming to a welcome end."

Mr. Bass and fellow producers Jamie Kennedy, Beverley Mitchell and Matt Seifnia have scheduled Actors' Equity auditions in late November for the play, and are looking to start rehearsals in February in advance of a spring opening. Written by Dean-Anthony Joseph Delgado Bradford, the eight-character ensemble production is described in an audition notice as a ''cold, hard, broad'' and ''dirty'' comedy about ''the pimp'' (Ms. Alley's character) and her coterie of assistants, escorts, and others."

Ruth was a brilliant teacher who passed onto generations of Brearley girls her passion for English literature. Her extraordinary ability, unaided by notes, to weave great swaths of Donne, Shakespeare and Milton into her lectures convinced students of the beauty of language and the glamour of literature. Many went into the world thinking of Donne or Hamlet as an elegantly dressed, animated woman with a slightly southern accent, as was Ruth. As a colleague and mentor to younger members of the department, Ruth was always interested, kind and generous. Her great gifts live on in both how and what we teach in the English Department. Brearley joins in sending sincere condolences to Ruth's many loving friends."

She came to New York in 1956, with her beloved husband Victor, after the Holocaust took most of their families, and began anew on the Upper West Side, where she raised two sons, Richard and Tom, and was a fashion boutique owner with her dear sister, Eva. She was the embodiment of class, elegance and warm-heartedness and she lit up every room she entered. One of her greatest joys was hosting holiday meals for her extended family. She did this with her Hungarian culinary grace and her kitchen was her castle. She also tended to her many fashion customers with her wit and style so that they not only looked stylish but also got her dose of life wisdom while they were being fitted. Her family was her truest pride and joy, and she has enriched all our lives: sons Richard and Tom, daughters-in-law Hope and Janet, and her three beloved grandchildren: Jonah, Tess and Lena. To see them grow up within four blocks of her apartment was like Moses' glimpse of the promised land: all that she and Victor struggled thru after WWII will live on thru her whole family and her passion for life and for family and for deep friendships has inspired all of us to continue in her shining example. She knew how to have fun, tell a great dirty joke and loved to swim each day at the Y, her elixir for 85 years. A celebration of her life and love will take place Friday, October 28th at 11am at ""The Riverside"" 76th and Amsterdam and the family will sit shiva in her home."

At a news conference at Sadler's Wells on Wednesday, he announced that he would create a new ''Sleeping Beauty'' for Christmas 2012 as part of a yearlong celebration of the 25th anniversary of his company, New Adventures. Shocking die-hard ballet fans, he declared, ''I don't really buy the idea of love at first sight,'' and talked about some of his ideas for the ballet. ''Nothing much happens from a plot point of view after Aurora goes to sleep,'' he said. ''I think I've fixed that.'' Pointing out that in most productions of ''Sleeping Beauty,'' the 100-year gap is barely noticeable from a costume point of view, he plans to set the opening scene of Aurora's christening in 1890 (the year of the work's premiere at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg). ''I have taken this as a starting point, setting the Christening of Aurora in the year of the ballet's first performance; the height of the fin-de-siecle period when fairies, vampires and decadent opulence fed the Gothic imagination,'' he writes in the news release. For the awakening, we'll be in 2011, he said. ''Possibly the wedding will take place in 2012,'' he added, ''just to be completely up to date.'' Before ''Sleeping Beauty,'' Sadler's Wells will present three of Mr. Bourne's early works on a mixed bill in May, and his much-acclaimed ''Play Without Words.''"

But your plan provider will soon be able to offer the advice itself, as long as it meets rules issued recently by the Department of Labor. Before the new regulations, which are effective Dec. 27, 401(k), individual retirement plan providers were required to hire an independent adviser to provide advice. That's because the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the law known as Erisa that governs retirement plans, prohibited advisers from recommending investments if they were paid for other services like administering the plans in the first place.

Flash forward to 1998, when Jamie's employer, Pfizer, begins marketing Viagra. And voilà! Jamie is on his way to fortune and a certain fame among his zealous clients. But somewhere in the midst of this sexual playground, he ogles the breasts of (and subsequently meets) Maggie (Anne Hathaway, above with Mr. Gyllenhaal), a free-wheeling, slightly cynical, commitment-shy artist with early-onset Parkinson's disease -- an illness Jamie and his arsenal of pills can't ward off. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called this film from Edward Zwick ''a sometimes intoxicating, sometimes headache-inducing cocktail: a sweet, libidinous love story; a candid comedy of bedroom and workplace manners; and, most bravely, if also most jarringly, a medical melodrama involving a chronic and very serious disease.'' Ms. Hathaway and Mr. Gyllenhaal ''are frequently delightful to watch, and their ease together is a rebuke to the self-conscious, emotionally cautious protocols of modern movie romance,'' he added.

James' stunning wit, generosity of mind and heart, brilliant conversation, and joy in the daily round will be terribly missed. He leaves behind a used pair of tap shoes, a yard full of exotic chickens, mornings in Thompson, nighttimes in New York, friends from all over the world, and most importantly his irrepressible collaborator in life and love, Margot. Predeceased by his first wife Catharina Kempe, remembered by his second wife Patricia Berry, Hillman is survived by his sisters Sue Becker and Sybil Pike, brother Joel, four children from his first marriage, Julia, Carola, Susanne, Laurence and five grandchildren. A Memorial Service in New York City will be announced at a later date. For those who wish, donations may be made to: Spring Publications, PO Box 230212 New York, NY 10023 in support of his Uniform Edition."

(He quotes from a paper he wrote ''at the age of 19'': ''The predicament of any tropological analysis of narrative always lies in its own effaced and circuitous recourse to a metaphoric mode of apprehending its object. . . . '') As a founder of the program, I remember Johnson, and he did write that way. But some semioticians wrote with clarity -- Tzvetan Todorov and Umberto Eco, for example -- and I rather think I did so myself. But students take what they want, or what they need at the time, and the good ones find ways to use or abuse what they learned -- or both.Robert Scholes"

The spiffy twist of Ben Hecht's screenplay (his uncredited collaborators are said to have included Moss Hart, George S.

In a long siege at makeshift gravel barricades, ethnic Serbs hurled rocks toward ethnic Albanians on the other side of the Ibar River, and this summer, hooded men in shorts and sneakers firebombed a border-control station, stoking fears among Western powers that ethnic clashes could spin out of control in northern Kosovo."
2011-10-30T00:00:00Z,"Behavioral scientists have long known that humans, whether in the schoolyard or in a dimly lighted bar, have a tendency to subconsciously mimic the sounds, style and movement of others. Recent research, however, shows that this mimicry also extends to how we speak and write. Even the least important words we choose can say a lot about us. In one unusual experiment, 187 men and women gathered on the Northwestern University campus to take part in several four-minute speed dates. The couples talked about their respective majors and where they grew up, but none of that interested the University of Texas at Austin psychologist James W. Pennebaker. Instead, his focus was on the barely noticed personal pronouns (I, you, me), articles (the, a), prepositions (for, of, on), conjunctions (but, and) and other small words. These commonly used so-called function words, about 180 in all, Pennebaker says, are processed rapidly and subconsciously. And our use of them can reveal, among other things, whether a romance will work out or how well two people work together."

Overcoming a lack of smooth roads and sidewalks, among other things, Kabul's skaters (girls included) find in skating a rare recreational outlet, Mr. Abrams said.

The plots are standard pulp premises. But the pleasure of watching a Suzuki has less to do with following the cryptic stories than the shuffle of his abrupt cutting, the sudden shifts in time and place, and the sensibility, which might be called black-humored modernist baroque.

2011-10-30T00:00:00Z,"Patriots (5-1) at Steelers (5-2) Sunday, 4:15 p.m. Line: Patriots by 3. In a world where the Colts lose by 55 points, the Jaguars can beat the Ravens without scoring a touchdown and games are becoming so boring that they have become upstaged by the postgame handshakes, it is heartening to know that we can still count on the Steelers' defense. Unfortunately, we cannot still count on the Steelers' defense. The Steelers have intercepted just two passes this season, an amazingly low figure when you run down the quarterbacks they have faced: Tarvaris Jackson, Blaine Gabbert, Kevin Kolb, Kerry Collins, Curtis Painter. Ten of the Steelers' 17 sacks came against Gabbert and Jackson, the standard-bearers in that cavalcade of regret. While Warren Sapp's ''old and slow'' estimation of the Steelers' defense after Week 1 was premature and slightly exaggerated, the Steel Curtain now has a higher-than-advertised aluminum content. The Steelers compensate for their declining defense with one of the best passing attacks in the league: they rank fifth in net passing yards per game and eighth in yards per attempt. And while the Patriots' offense is better than Pittsburgh's, their defense is far worse, allowing a league-high 423 yards per game. So get ready for a back-and-forth, high-scoring offensive battle. After last week's games, you deserve it. Pick: Steelers."

Two weeks ago, more than 100,000 young people got an early start at ComicCon at the Javits Center, a third of them in costume relating to their favorite superheroes and supergoblins. This extravaganza of fantasy dressing brought to mind the September fashion collection of Gareth Pugh, with modernist skeletal clothes and Kenny Scharf-style pointed heads. All over the city, the urge to decorate with simulated cobwebs stretched over jack-o'-lanterns and over the entrances of Victorian brownstones. At the Union Square Greenmarket, children did what came naturally, climbing over and through the pumpkin patch."
2011-10-30T00:00:00Z,"CARPENTER--Ruth C. A teacher, mentor, literary scholar and friend of unparalleled intellect and generosity, Ruth Corn Carpenter, of New Milford, Connecticut and New York City, passed away peacefully on the evening of October 23, 2011. Only child of Lorlene Johnson and Wilbur Graves Corn, Ruth grew up in Franklin, Tennessee, and attended The Harpeth Hall School, where she was valedictorian. She was graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1957 with a B.A. in English, first in her class and summa cum laude. Among other honors, she was awarded Marshall and Fulbright scholarships, and studied at Cambridge University in England, where she received an M.A. She also won Bryn Mawr's European Fellowship, the college's highest honor for a member of the graduating class. Ruth then began a 50-year career studying and teaching literature. Many of her students have described her as the most brilliant mind and greatest teacher they have ever encountered in any field at any institution. She taught briefly at Barnard College, and in South Korea at Ewha Women's University, but primarily lavished her great literary and pedagogical gifts on the girls of the Brearley School in New York City, where she taught for 40 years, and where she was the guiding star of an English department that rivaled any in the country. Ruth opened the minds of thousands of Brearley girls to the abiding value of literature. She taught everything from Malory to Jane Austen to Samuel Beckett to Langston Hughes, but Shakespeare was her first love, literally. At the age of 12, she saw a traveling production of Hamlet in Franklin, Tennessee, and suddenly she ""was in love"" -- simultaneously with the red headed actor playing the lead, with Hamlet and with Shakespeare. It was to Ruth's Shakespeare elective that the students of Brearley flocked every year, and it was to Shakespeare that she primarily devoted her luminous attention after retiring from the Brearley School in 2000. From 2000 through 2011, Ruth was the head of adult education at, and taught Shakespeare seminars for, the Shakespeare Society in New York City. Like generations of Brearley girls, Ruth's adult students became enthralled by Ruth's remarkable ability to deepen, complicate and expand their understanding of, and feeling for, the fully formed characters we meet in Shakespeare's plays. Ruth Carpenter offered to all her students, young and old, a new way of comprehending Shakespeare, the world and themselves. That is the essence of her legacy to us all. She would have us continue to regard Shakespeare with new eyes; and to those who protest they cannot do that without her she would say (quoting readily from The Winter's Tale), ""It is required you do awake your faith."" Ruth was a radiant spirit and a devout humanist who also firmly believed in the immortality of the soul. Her enormously generous heart, a lifetime devoted to seeing human beings fully, in life as in literature, and her linguistic brilliance made her at once a wise and compassionate friend, and a wonderfully witty one too. The entire English language was at her command, and her grip on it never failed. Moreover, the invariable elegance of her attire matched the elegance of her mind, and we will rarely see her like again for sartorial perfection. For Ruth, as for Shakespeare, ""nothing human was alien to her,"" and her sheer love of life and her friends rivaled that of her beloved Falstaff. She also made friends with bats and snakes and blue jays and geese and all the denizens of her Connecticut gardens that were a source of endless pleasure. Ruth now joins her loving partner of 20 years, Dick Gershman, who died in 1998. Ruth is survived by the love of her best friends Alexa and Fred Aldridge, Ann McDonald and Ellie Rittman, and by the love and devotion of all the Aldridges, who are her godchildren and family: Mindy Aldridge and her daughter, Katharine, and Richard and Kris Aldridge, and their children Hank, Eliza, Bo and Evie. Ruth's funeral will be private. A memorial service will be held in New York City, the details of which will be announced. Ruth asked that, in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the Shakespeare Society, 118-122 Baxter Street, Suite 705, New York, New York 10013."

Victories in these classics significantly raise the stature of horses, jockeys, trainers and owners alike and have a lasting impact on one's legacy, often tipping the scales in one's favor when it's time to be considered for the Hall of Fame. Today, and for much of the last two-plus decades, these same competitors have circled a fourth race on their calendars at the start of each year, the Breeders' Cup Classic. Trainers with Classic contenders plot their race schedule for the year based on the timing of the Classic, and winning the Classic has proven to deliver all the spoils that Triple Crown races do - a massive payday, Eclipse awards and lucrative breeding potential. Which is why we're calling the Classic thoroughbred racing's fourth major."

The photographer John Conn, 62, spent those years documenting the subway system, what was then the dungeon of the city's haunted house. His images from underground include a bat-wielding man in a hunchback costume, a nun absorbed in a tabloid newspaper with a front-page headline about an attack on the pope and a disembodied arm brandishing a switchblade through an open subway window. The images have a quality of ghoulishness: fear and madness, as if seen through the eyes of a frightened child on a never-ending Halloween night."

No wonder that François Truffaut said of the movie that it makes us feel as if we were there as it was being made, instead of simply watching a finished product. ''For an instant,'' he wrote in ''The Films in My Life,'' ''we think to ourselves, 'I'll come back tomorrow and see if it all turns out the same way.' ''"

2011-10-30T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Having taught at Brown for 16 years, including a course on Charles Sanders Peirce, the modern founder of sign theory, I found Steven Johnson's essay to be a depressingly accurate characterization of the academic times during his college years. However, readers should know that his identification of semiotics as a field of study by linking it with Peirce, an American philosopher, and the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure is a serious, albeit common, misconception. Saussure's version is defective next to Peirce's, and not curable by patch-up. That it was Saussure's ideas about signs, and not Peirce's, that gave rise to the Continental form Jacques Derrida and others propagated -- and gullible American academics swallowed whole -- should not be so glibly elided. Peirce is the greatest intellect the Americas ever produced, and it is his whole philosophy, including his semeiotic (note the spelling and the singular number) that now bids fair to prevail as doctrine."

2011-10-30T00:00:00Z,"No one, in the 21st century, would have thought we needed, or even could use, another Winnie the Pooh film. For Pooh purists, those who have always taken delight in A. A. Milne's mischievous wordplay and E. H. Shepard's delicate yet robust pen-and-ink illustrations, the 1966 Disney short ''Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree'' was quite enough, thank you, and its numerous follow-ups only added insult to injury. But the 2011 ''Winnie the Pooh'' represents a bridge -- a Poohsticks bridge, if you will -- between those who hold Milne's works sacred and those who are perfectly O.K. with putting a red T-shirt on a once-gloriously unadorned mohair bear. In this new ''Winnie the Pooh'' -- directed by Stephen J. Anderson and Don Hall and narrated by John Cleese -- our Bear of Very Little Brain and the usual suspects (including Piglet, Rabbit, Owl and Tigger) reassemble for an important mission: to find the missing tail of the endearingly morose Eeyore. From there the story winds its way along a graceful, curving arc that introduces (and, if you watch through the end of the credits, beautifully resolves) the story of a new character, a terrible, horned beastie known as the Backson, who destroys everything -- books, toys, teacups -- that children and their stuffed animals hold dear. (The Backson, of course, doesn't exist, but is merely the result of Owl's misinterpretation of a note from Christopher Robin, in which he writes that he'll be ''back soon.'')"

2011-10-30T00:00:00Z,"As a teenager, I was delighted to discover on the map of Tolkien's Middle-earth the name of the city where I was born. Not the same town, of course, but another, fantastical place with the same name. Nevertheless, the map gave me options. I could be a native of Bree, a small, unremarkable town in northeastern Belgium. Or I could hail from that other Bree, equally small and unremarkable, but at least located in a world brimming with magic, danger and adventure. In contrast, my home province of Limburg, in Belgium's northeast, is generally flat, and on the whole bereft of elves, orcs, hobbits and wizards. So I spent many hours exploring Tolkien's world, dreaming up adventures of my own in the far corners of that map. I soon discovered that the cartography of the real-world version of Bree had one critical advantage over its Middle-earth counterpart: it had borders. Bree's corner of northwestern Europe was dotted with a tangle of boundaries, indicating the multitude of countries, cultures and languages jostling for their place on the map."

Coming toward the end of that brief, disreputable era before Joseph Breen and the Motion Picture Production Code instituted the moralizing that has dogged movies ever since, Ernst Lubitsch and Ben Hecht's loose adaptation of Noël Coward's great play is, like ''Shampoo'' or ''Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,'' an American comedy that is utterly grown up about sex and speaks to its audience on those terms. The young, impossibly sexy Gary Cooper and the sleek Fredric March play American bohemians in Paris, a painter and a playwright, who meet another American, a commercial artist named Gilda (Miriam Hopkins, above with March, left, and Cooper), and each decides that he wants her.

Despite their long World Series drought, Stark noted, the Rangers had never inspired the same kind of undying passion as frustrated franchises like the Cubs or Indians or pre-2004 Red Sox: Instead of agonizing over their baseball nine's inability to win it all, the Dallas-Fort Worth fan base mainly just ignored them. But a Rangers victory over the Saint Louis Cardinals, he suggested, might change all that: ""If these Rangers find a way to win just one more time, life in Texas may never be the same all-Cowboys-all-the-time universe again."""

2011-10-31T13:10:45Z,"The New York artist Sue de Beer has long established herself as an aesthetic interlocutor of teens and the occult, so Halloween provides an apt occasion for her to unveil a new work. De Beer's practice first took root through domestically appointed video installations that channeled deep, dark, suburban, subcultural angst. She has steadily drifted toward explorations of the paranormal, conjuring Puritan New England for her 2007 horror film, ""The Quickening,"" and more recently - and more minimally - evoking the inherent eeriness of spaces through structures inspired by Brion Gysin's ""Dream Machine"" or corporate entities like the Seagram Building. ""Haunt Room,"" which opened over the weekend on the 14th Street passageway of the High Line, is a 15-foot-wide frosted plexiglass tetradecagon outfitted with powerful infrasound speakers that pump low-frequency tones outside the range of human hearing. According to experiments conducted by Goldsmiths College, these vibrations are capable, in theory, of producing a ""haunted"" feeling - or at the very least the perception of strange smells and physiological hallucinations like dizziness. Visitors may enter and judge for themselves how easily their sensory perceptions are smeared. ""This is a New York 'haunted house'"" de Beer says.

He was born on Beacon Street in Boston, Massachusetts, May 16, 1918 to Admiral William A. Read and Edith Fabyan Read. Mr. Read grew up in Purchase, N.Y. and was educated in New England, attending St. Paul's School and the Hun School.

2011-10-31T00:00:00Z,"It would be hard to overstate the level of preposterousness that surrounds Jon Gnarr, the punk rocker-turned-comedic actor-turned mayor of Reykjavik, Iceland. Mr. Gnarr was elected in 2010 after he formed a quasi-satirical political party, the Best Party; his campaign promises included putting a polar bear in the city zoo and offering free towels in the swimming pools - as well as a promise to break all his campaign promises. Given that degree of personal absurdity, his appearance in New York on Saturday, to speak at a small conference dedicated to the future of radio, would qualify as merely unlikely. Mr. Gnarr was the keynote speaker of the first Radiovision Festival, a three-day conference put on by the radio station WFMU; other guests included representatives from Twitter, Kickstarter, the Web site Know Your Meme and Makerbot, which produces 3D-printers."

The 30-second spots, which run at the beginning and end of the hourlong episodes, are shot in a style similar to the program's. Both the spots and the show, made by the Documentary Group, feature interviews. For the series, the creators, writers and actors behind prime-time television shows are interviewed, while the interviews in the underwriting spots are with unnamed Dove marketing and public relations executives, who discuss how the brand tries to relate to changing consumers."

An unusually heavy autumn snowstorm in the Northeast may have kept some potential ticket buyers at home: Hollywood had been expecting a total closer to $40 million. But ''Puss in Boots,'' which cost about $130 million to make and was distributed by Paramount Pictures, received strong critical reviews and an A-minus from audiences in exit polls, opening up the possibility of solid sales in weekends ahead. Paramount's ultra-low-budget ''Paranormal Activity 3'' was second, selling about $18.5 million in tickets for a two-week total of $81.3 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. ''In Time,'' a $40 million thriller from 20th Century Fox and New Regency, was a soft third, taking in about $12 million. ''Footloose'' (Paramount) was fourth, taking in $5.4 million for a three-week total of $38.4 million. In a rare misfire, Johnny Depp brought up the rear as his ''Rum Diary,'' financed at an estimated $50 million and released by FilmDistrict, placed fifth with about $5 million in ticket sales."

The egg disappeared - presumably into the pockets of a Soviet customs official - when the family immigrated to Australia in the 1970s, but Kogan retains clear memories of it. ""It opened up into three sections, and in the center was a hand-painted icon,"" recalls Kogan, who riffs on Fabergé's legendary craftsmanship and stylized nature motifs in pieces like these diamond drop earrings and ring.
