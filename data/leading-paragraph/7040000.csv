2008-02-24T00:00:00Z,"Just as her muse Jean-Michel Basquiat used to say, “Believe it or not, I can actually draw,” the British knitwear sensation Clare Tough says she can actually knit. Still, grandmothers everywhere may grumble that some of her graffiti-inspired creations (like her Brooklyn Bridge bra, a skimpy creation in wool and balsa wood) break every rule of the purl-one-knit-two set. Ditto for the zippered cardigan with an overload of ribbed patchwork and vibrant embroideries, which she says has about 50 types of yarn. Tough first got noticed in 2004 with her Central Saint Martins graduation show: the string outfits of Jamaican dancehall queens re-envisioned as cobwebby knit dresses. But her real obsession is ’80s New York, having grown up in the picture-postcard spa town Malvern listening to Fab 5 Freddie and old hip-hop compilations. Tough, 27, is bent on expanding the definition of knitwear. “I didn’t invent crochet, obviously, but I really think the way I patchwork garments together hasn’t been done before,” she says in her East London studio. “Knitting has got a frumpy image, and it really shouldn’t.” [?][?][?]SUSIE RUSHTON THE REMIX."
2008-02-24T00:00:00Z,"I was about 20 years old and determined to wear a red Valentino dress to my friend’s debutante ball. I had a crush on a boy who was going to be there, and had seen how when my mother wore Valentino couture she immediately became the center of attention. Without fail, a moment of silence would occur as she stepped into a room, much like a pause in a music score. I wanted to experience this intense feeling for myself. When I asked to borrow Mom’s dress, she flatly refused, saying that red at a coming-out party went against all codes of etiquette. So I did what any savvy New York girl would do: I called Valentino himself, who was thrilled at the idea of making me the social scandal of the season. He gave me my own gown, and since then, I have worn many more — recently to his anniversary in Rome and to Elton John’s birthday party. The effect is always the same: his shade of red is so rich and beautiful that it makes you want to slightly misbehave. Oh, and about that guy I liked way back then — it worked."
2008-02-24T00:00:00Z,"Swap-a-rama Razzmatazz is one of London’s most fashionable club nights — and certainly its most eccentric. Its origins date to the time when a chap named Alex Collins studied abroad and lived on a commune where many garments were communal property. Eager to recreate back home that “year of my life when not having possessions didn’t bother me,” Collins held a party at which guests were told to swap outfits every time a whistle blew. The mayhem inspired Eloise Markwell-Butler, Dean Slydell, Dani Mazzer and Nick Frew to take the concept public, aided by donations from the vintage megastore Beyond Retro. Swap-a-rama Razzmatazz is now held at Favela Chic in the Shoreditch neighborhood once every month. Clotheslines festoon the club, and when the klaxon sounds, you either swap or split: ogling bystanders are evicted. Markwell-Butler likens it to “being in a mad person’s laundry.” Since partygoers keep their booty, at £3 for admission, it’s London’s cheapest way to get a new wardrobe. [?][?][?]SARAH NIR."

But when she learned that the photographer in question was Nobuyoshi Araki, the celebrated master of nude bondage pictures, it turned out that Kusama was only too happy to oblige. And so, on a quiet Thursday afternoon, after an hour or so of failed efforts to interview Kusama, I waited with the artist and her staff around a conference table for Araki’s arrival.

Bloomers — sometimes diaperish, usually subversive and most women’s idea of fashion hell — produced smirks and double-takes in New York and Europe. Gaultier’s iteration had a “Pirates of Penzance” picturesqueness. In an unusually insane show, Comme des Garçons advanced the possibility of bloomers that were not just frilly but also falling apart. Prada’s take, short-short and sewn in shiny fabrics, was straight from the stroller. Betsey Johnson, well, you can guess. While today’s bloomers can be traced in a straight line to the pumpkin breeches that Renaissance men wore at the top of their hose, they are but fuzzy cousins to the garment favored by the early women’s libber who lent them her name, Amelia Bloomer. She rebelled against the petticoats and floor-grazing skirts of the mid-19th century in favor of knee-skimming designs layered over ballooning trousers gathered at the ankles. The bifurcated look had something weirdly haremlike about it and, however liberating, was light only in relation to what had come before. Bloomer was ridiculed but of course vindicated with the hindsight of history. Designers have fallen in and out of love with bloomers at least since 1976. Bonnie Cashin, the sportswear pioneer, celebrated the bicentennial with a collection of “Amelias.” “Bonnie loved bloomers because they could be completely customized by the wearer,” says Stephanie Lake of the Bonnie Cashin Foundation. Is there any designer who hasn’t dabbled in bloomers? You can wear out your search engine trying to find one. Saint Laurent’s fling was in 1987. Vivienne Westwood cast her vote in velvet in 1998.

2008-02-24T00:00:00Z,"Cecil Beaton possessed a keen eye for all things fashionable. While he found his métier as a portrait photographer, he also played the role of dandy, diarist, Oscar-winning costumer and, oddly enough, fabric designer. Now, through the London interior design company Beaudesert and the archives of Ascher Studio, reproductions of Beaton’s checks, florals and stripes are being sold at Liberty of London. The Cecil Beaton fabric collection — on silk, cotton, linen and wallpaper — was inspired by a scarf that Beaudesert’s managing director, Andrew Ginger, found on eBay; Beaton had originally designed it for the textile firm Ascher. In the 1940s and early ’50s, Zika Ascher commissioned artists such as Henri Matisse and Henry Moore to design fabrics, paying them £25 per motif, according to his son, Peter. All the big designers, like Balenciaga, Givenchy, Lanvin and Yves Saint Laurent, would buy their fabrics from Ascher Studio. Although not known for his brush strokes, Beaton was an obvious choice for fabric, and Zika allowed him free rein. “An artist with a color sense is not someone you mess with,” Zika has been quoted as saying. The timing couldn’t be better, as this spring’s runways were full of blossoms. Can’t you just see the Beaton bouquet on your fainting couch? [?][?][?]MELISSA FELDMAN."

2008-02-24T00:00:00Z,"ON most days, Matthew Davis, a 28-year-old portfolio manager, can count on spending about two hours getting to work and another two hours getting home. That's going against the tide of commuters going into New York City for work. Mr. Davis, who rented an apartment in Park Slope in Brooklyn when he landed a job in the securities industry in New York, found himself not on Wall Street, but in Ronkonkoma, working for a financial services management company. He starts his morning with a stop for tea and a bagel at his neighborhood delicatessen, and walks 30 minutes or takes the subway to the Flatbush Avenue terminal of the Long Island Rail Road. In Jamaica, Queens, he changes trains and settles in for a 60-minute ride to his company's office near MacArthur Airport, deep in Suffolk County. There, he keeps a car for the last leg of the commute, a total of two hours each way. ''Usually, until I get to Mineola, I have to stand, but then I find a seat and read the paper,'' he said. ''I tried to find an apartment closer to work, but after 20 minutes of driving, I still wasn't anyplace that was close to anything. I really like living in the city.''"

Weaver relied on observational drawing, not photography, to record his impressions. He then created a series of paintings that appeared in the March 5, 1962, issue of the magazine. Weaver's drawings capture the timeless qualities of spring training: confident men in easy postures, unfurling themselves to throw, to bat or simply to wait around. Weaver, who died in 1994, brought a journalist's mindset to illustration. His sketchbook reports on the stadiums and the social order they represent. Fans and vendors get sensitive treatment, even as nettings and railings double as implied barriers. Advertising messages are amplified. An integrated game is bracketed by segregated stands. --D.B.

2008-02-24T00:00:00Z,"He's hardly a household name, but more than 60 years after Bernard Rudofsky became an intellectual celebrity, his work still resonates in our lives. The Vienna-trained architect was a polymath who questioned every aspect of modernism, from design, architecture and museum installations to textiles and fashion. The 1944 show ''Are Clothes Modern?'' that he curated at the Museum of Modern Art included shoes, some of which he ridiculed for their unwearableness and others, modeled after sandals from antiquity, that he praised. Throngs of visitors were wowed by the exhibition: there was an uneven floor (to reconnect you with your feet) and a mirror by the exit (to force you to confront yourself). Soon after, Rudofsky founded Bernardo sandals (relaunched in 2001), and by the 1960s Jackie Kennedy was said to own 16 colors of the same pair. After helping design the American pavilion for the 1958 world's fair in Brussels and decamping to Japan, a culture he later analyzed in ''The Kimono Mind,'' Rudofsky staged ''Now I Lay Me Down to Eat'' at the Cooper-Hewitt in 1980. The show finally allowed him to present his take on bodily functions (anyone for a urine tube?). Promising to be just as lively is ''Lessons From Bernard Rudofsky'' at the Getty in L.A. from March 11 to June 8. CAROL KINO"

But Mr. Castro kept making his views known anyway, sometimes undercutting his brother.

I was happy to be active in the Workmen's Circle and to write and prepare the monthly bulletin of my Penn South Branch 1076 for many years.

2008-02-24T00:00:00Z,"HERTZ--Sally A resident of Great Neck for 50 years, died at her home in Maplewood, NJ, on January 23 at the age of 83. Political and community activist. She devoted herself to progressive causes and cultural projects which have enriched her community. A founding member of the Great Neck Chapter of Womens Strike for Peace, she devoted much time, energy, and effort to the causes of international disarmament, peace, and civil rights. Sally was instrumental in finding an apartment for the first Black teacher in Great Neck. Her deep commitment to integration and fairness meant that anyone who came to her with a just cause could receive a financial contribution or a sincere effort to help with their struggle. She spent many years as the driving force and Director of the North Shore Community Art Centers ''Off Center'' shop, which raised much needed funds for the Center. She will be greatly missed by her many friends in Great Neck, as well as by the many less-privileged members of our community who benefitted directly from her energy, commitment, and work on their behalf. Sally enjoyed weekends of sailing the Long Island Sound with her husband, Harold. She and Harold visited many countries around the world, including India, Turkey, Cuba, U.S.S.R, much of Europe and Asia. Sally was a small person with a tremendous zest for life. She was extremely energetic and continued to enjoy the many cultural events that NYC had to offer. She was always ready to fight the good fight, stand up for the little guy and had very strong beliefs in integrity and right and wrong, perhaps fueled by her first hand experience of Anti-Semitism as a child in Poland. Sally loved a good story that was well told and even better, a good joke, and her laugh was legendary. She spent the last several years of her life in Maplewood, NJ. She is survived by her daughter, Madeline Hertz, of New Providence, NJ, her son, Robert Hertz, of San Diego, California, her sister, Dorothy Lastfogel, eight grandsons, two great-grandchildren, and several nieces and nephews. She was predeceased by her husband of 55 years, Harold Hertz, her son, William Hertz, and her grandson, Jason Hertz.

Ms. Smith was born September 6, 1943, in Providence, RI, daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Gordon Schaubhut of Upper Montclair, NJ. She graduated from Mount Holyoke College and received a master's degree in Italian from Middlebury College. Early in her career, Judyth was the director of the patron program of the Metropolitan Opera Association at Lincoln Center. Her legacy at the Met includes numerous translations of the Mozart Libretti. She lived for several years in Florence, Italy, where she taught English to Italians, both in Florence and Bologna. She was admired for her mastery of the Italian language, which she spoke flawlessly, as well as for her stunning red-headed beauty. She loved the fine arts and dedicated many years to the Save Venice Foundation, where she coordinated fundraising events in both New York and Venice. Judyth spent the later part of her life dedicated to her love of translating and teaching the Italian language. Her many devoted New York City students will miss her lessons. Perhaps her most interesting translation work was for Pope John Paul II. She did both research and English translations for the various versions of the Holy Father's only CD, ''Abba Pater''. She loved nature, animals, and gardening; this love of all living creatures led her to care for abandoned animals. Judyth was a loyal friend who had both inner and outer beauty; her friendship was a precious gift to those who loved her for her brilliant intellect and sense of humor. Judyth is survived by her brother Stephen C. Schaubhut, sister Margaret Ellen Sonandres, brother Gordon Schaubhut, and six nieces and nephews.

2008-02-24T00:00:00Z,"Imagine, if you will, the Tony Award-winning musical of 2108. The set, created entirely by Industrial Light & Magic, is a black box filled with constantly shifting 3-D animation. A virtual orchestra replaces musicians. And as for actors, who needs them? Holograms of Nathan Lane and Patti LuPone will be earning standing ovations. To some this may seem like a dystopian nightmare. But we've been inching toward it, and maybe that's not an entirely bad thing. In the last few years Broadway set designers have experimented with increasingly sophisticated animation and projections, to mixed results. But perhaps no Broadway show has so ably integrated computer-generated animation and real, old-fashioned sets as ''Sunday in the Park With George,'' a Roundabout Theater Company production at Studio 54. Its director, Sam Buntrock, points to the future with virtual characters, like an animated dog that gets some of the evening's biggest laughs."
2008-02-24T00:00:00Z,"Peoples' eyes constantly deceive them, and that was certainly true in Paris in the fall of 1996, when Rei Kawakubo, the designer behind Comme des Garçons, presented a collection of dresses swollen with huge lumps. In profile, the models looked like hunchbacks or camels tipped onto their sides. There were smaller, kidney-shaped masses on shoulders and arms, most covered in cheerful gingham. The clothes confounded critics, even those used to Kawakubo's abstract methods. Amy Spindler wrote in The New York Times that Kawakubo had ''invented whole new deformities for women.'' During the show, which was conducted in silence, one photographer muttered, ''Quasimodo.'' ''Lumps and Bumps,'' as the collection came to be called, illustrates the difficulties for a designer of being not merely original but also a modernist. Kawakubo said she was interested in exploring ''volume and space.'' If you begin with the outline made by her shapes (the classic ''silhouette'') and then pull back -- moving away, as it were, from the confinements of fashion -- you realize that Kawakubo has in fact recreated a reality of the late 20th century: the individual seemingly joined to her backpack and her burdens; even the act of talking on a cellphone assumes a spatial connection, producing what appears in the abstract to be a growth. Kawakubo's objective was not to distort the female body but rather to express a thought that probably, for her, began with a gesture or a glimpse. Some designers, like Alber Elbaz of Lanvin and Azzedine Alaïa, solve problems of dressmaking -- putting darts in a skirt to give it softer volume. Kawakubo, working more in the spirit of an artist than any designer today, attacks the problems of consciousness."

Mr. Lehman grew up in Tarrytown, NY, graduated from the Scarborough and The Taft Schools, Princeton University and New York University where he earned masters and doctorate degrees in American history. In 1947 he partnered with Eleanor Roosevelt and Bernard Baruch, and founded Just One Break (JOB), whose mission is to find competitive employment for people with disabilities. JOB is the nations's oldest not-for-profit employment service for people with disabilities. Over half a century after founding it, Orin Lehman remained Chairman Emeritus of its board of directors until his death. In 1975, Gov. Hugh L. Carey offered Mr. Lehman the job of Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and he jumped at it saying it is ''The greatest job in the world.'' He was re-appointed by Governor Mario Cuomo, and by the time he retired in 1993, he had served 18 years as Commissioner, the longest period of any individual in that position. He was a soft-spoken man with a quiet bearing which belied his sense of humor and fun-loving nature. He will be greatly missed by his friends and family. Mr. Lehman was married to the late Jane Bagley Lehman and is survived by his former wife, Wendy Vanderbilt Lehman, his three daughters, Susan Lehman Carmichael (Trent) of Greenwich, CT, Brooke Lehman of New York City, Sage Lehman of New York City and his four grandchildren Avery, Haley, Ryan and Whitney Carmichael. His companion Monique Van Vooren and his beloved Boston Terrier, Snookums, also survive him. A Memorial service will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, New York City on Tuesday, February 26th at 5:00pm. The Rabbi Ronald Sobel will officiate. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations may be made to Just One Break (JOB), 570 Seventh Ave, NY, NY 10018. www.justonebreak.com LEHMAN--Orin. Lehman Brothers mourns the loss of a community leader who devoted time selflessly to a number of causes to better the lives of others.

The Firm extends its deepest sympathy to his family. Richard S. Fuld, Jr. Chairman and CEO Lehman Brothers LEHMAN--Orin. In sorrow Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York records the passing of our distinguished and longtime member, Orin Lehman. With his family, we share the grief of loss and bereavement.

On land, too, organisms occupy every conceivable niche, from deep in the bowels of the earth to the tops of the highest mountains. The air is different. To be sure, many creatures travel through it. Some flit briefly, as when a flying squid bursts from the ocean's foam, zooming 20 meters or so before plopping back into the brine. Young spiders balloon off on silken threads, wafting in the breezes, to find new territories. Other animals make more lengthy journeys, as when butterflies and birds fly for hundreds of miles, migrating to Europe from Africa for the summer."

2008-02-24T00:00:00Z,"STEINHARDT--Roger W., M.D., of Rye, New York, died peacefully on February 22, 2008 at his home at The Osborn. Born on April 6, 1913 in New York, New York, he was 94. He was a loving husband, father, father-in-law and grandfather, a caring and accomplished doctor, and a true friend. He was a graduate of the Franklin School in Manhattan, the University of Pennsylvania and New York University College of Medicine, completed his residency at Bellevue Hospital, and was a medical captain in the European theatre in the U.S. Army during WWII. An internist for four decades in private practice in Manhattan, he was affiliated with Doctors, Lenox Hill and Mt. Sinai hospitals. His patients fondly recollect his reassuring, knowledgeable manner, his gentle wit and his readiness to make house calls night and day -on his bicycle. He was an early advocate of medical peer review and served on many professional committees including as Secretary of the Board of Ethics and thereafter as President of the New York County Medical Society (1980-1981). After leaving private practice in 1986, he was a medical advisor in the Office of Professional Medical Conduct-State of New York, Department of Health until 2003 when he retired his stethoscope at the age of 89. A life-long golf enthusiast, he was a longtime member, among other clubs, of Fairview Country Club and shot a hole in one shortly after his 80th birthday. Boating was another joyous pastime, enjoyed on many weekends on LI Sound captaining BonBini, his boat, moored on the creek at Fairfield Beach. His early attachment to Maine and Camp Winnebago never withered; indeed, he returned long past counselor age limits to serve as camp doctor. His deepest and most constant passion and love was for his growing family. He was predeceased by his wife of 29 years, Susanne J. Bleecker of New York, in 1974. He is survived by his wife of 32 years, Alice Rogers of Rye, NY; two daughters, Jill Steinhardt Goldman of Bedford, NY and Manhattan and Nancy Steinhardt Fuzesi of Greenwich, CT; three step-children, Tom Rogers of Larchmont, NY, Barbara Rogers of Chevy Chase, MD, and Tracey Rogers of Newton, MA; eleven grandchildren: Jeff Goldman of Portland, ME, Stephen Fuzesi of Washington, DC, Daniel Goldman of Cincinnati, OH, Robyn Sue Goldman of San Francisco, CA, Timothy Fuzesi of Greenwich, CT, Robert Rogers of Cambridge, MA, Jessica and Jason Rogers of Larchmont, NY, Isaac and Jake Schwartz Rogers of Newton, MA, and Cassia Williams Rogers of Chevy Chase, MD.

2008-02-25T00:00:00Z,"LEHMAN--Orin, educator, philanthropist, civil rights advocate and conservationist with a life-long commitment to public service, died February 22, 2008. He died peacefully at home in New York City surrounded by his loving family and friends. The cause of death was pneumonia. Born January 14, 1920, he was 88. He was the son of the late Allan Sigmund and Evelyn Schiffer Lehman, and the brother of the late Ellen Lehman Long. He was the great-grandson of Mayer Lehman, founder of Lehman Brothers investment house, and grandnephew of Herbert Lehman, the former Governor of New York and U.S. Senator. Mr. Lehman grew up in Tarrytown, NY, graduated from the Scarborough and The Taft Schools, Princeton University and New York University where he earned masters and doctorate degrees in American history.In World War II, Lehman was an Army pilot with the rank of Captain. He was badly wounded in Germany during the Battle of the Bulge and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Purple Heart. In 1947 he partnered with Eleanor Roosevelt and Bernard Baruch, and founded Just One Break (JOB), whose mission is to find competitive employment for people with disabilities. JOB is the nations's oldest not-for-profit employment service for people with disabilities. Over half a century after founding it, Orin Lehman remained Chairman Emeritus of its board of directors until his death. Mr. Lehman's first public appointment came in 1950 when President Truman appointed him to the advisory board of the Economic Cooperation Administration where he succeeded his great-uncle Herbert Lehman. In 1952, while an associate in the Lehman Brothers firm, he was designated New York City's Outstanding Young Man of the Year by the Junior Chamber of Commerce. While prominently engaged in public life, Lehman explored a variety of careers. He served as an economic adviser to the U.S. mission at the United Nations, became the Chairman of the New York Board of Corrections, and published weekly newspapers. He served as Chairman of the Board of the New School of Social Research for ten years, where he also taught. In the 1970's he produced theatrical plays offBroadway, among them two hits by Jules Feiffer and the Pulitzer Prize winning play ''The Effects of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds'' by Paul Zindel. In 1975, Gov. Hugh L. Carey offered Mr. Lehman the job of Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation which he accepted, calling it ''The greatest job in the world.'' He was re-appointed by Governor Mario Cuomo, and by the time he retired in 1993, he had served 18 years as Commissioner, the longest period of any individual in that position. Mr. Lehman understood the value that parks would play not only in lives of New Yorkers, but also their overall benefit to the environment. His highest priority was making parks and open spaces accessible to all, long before it was the fashion and the law of the land. He was loved and respected by state park employees who affectionately called him ''Father Nature.'' During his tenure, the Empire State Summer and Winter Games, Senior Games and Games for the Physically Challenged were created. In addition to his public service, Mr. Lehman lived life to the fullest, playing golf, flying airplanes, and never letting his need for crutches interfere with his active schedule. Mr. Lehman was Chairman of the Board of Governors of the American Jewish Committee, a trustee of the Taft School, where he received the Citation of Merit Award, a director for UNESCO, 1968-1971 (United Nations Educational, Scientific & Cultural Organization), a director of the Educational Broadcasting Corporation, 1965-1974, a trustee of the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Foundation and a member of The Council on Foreign Relations. He was, until his death, a member of The Century Association in New York City. He was a soft-spoken man with a quiet bearing which belied his sense of humor and fun-loving nature. He will be greatly missed by his friends and family. Mr. Lehman was married to the late Jane Bagley Lehman and is survived by his former wife, Wendy Vanderbilt Lehman, his three daughters, Susan Lehman Carmichael (Mrs. Trent) of Greenwich, CT, Brooke Lehman and Sage Lehman of New York City and his four grandchildren Avery, Haley, Ryan and Whitney Carmichael. His companion Monique Van Vooren and his beloved Boston Terrier, Snookums, also survive him. A Memorial service will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, New York City on Tuesday, February 26th at 5:00pm. The Rabbi Ronald Sobel will officiate. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations may be made to Just One Break (JOB), 570 Seventh Ave, NY, NY 10018. www.justonebreak.com"

Chumby is also interesting because its business model is unusual. It wants to sell its hardware at the break-even point and make its profit from advertising shown on the device.

Then she started getting expansive and interior. Her next hit, ''Tyrone,'' was a routine over a vamp she had worked out onstage. Those long vamps became her direction, at the expense of songwriting and concision.

2008-02-26T00:00:00Z,"After a long battle two rare sixth-century B.C. marble sculptures that once belonged to the New York businessman Maurice Tempelsman go on view Tuesday at Italy’s presidential palace. For nearly 30 years rumors circulated that tomb robbers had dug up the statues on a hillside in the ancient Greek settlement of Morgantina in Sicily. After amassing evidence that they were looted, Italian investigators began seeking a handover of the acroliths — statues usually made with wooden torsos but with stone heads and extremities — in the late 1980s. Mr. Tempelsman, a diamond importer perhaps best known for having been the companion of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, remained unswayed until the Italian government threatened to sue him, an official said Monday. “He hadn’t wanted to give them up because he’d paid for them; that’s what he told me,” said Mario Bondioli Osio, who formerly headed of an Italian commission that sought to recover the country’s lost cultural patrimony. Mr. Tempelsman, who was said to be traveling and unavailable for comment, bought the acroliths from the London dealer Robin Symes in 1980 for a reported $1 million. In 2002 Mr. Bondioli Osio, Mr. Tempelsman and the University of Virginia worked out a deal under which Mr. Tempelsman would give the university partial ownership of the statues for five years and then cede them entirely. On Jan. 1 the acroliths — their wooden bodies long ago lost, leaving two heads, three hands and three feet — became the property of the university, which promptly returned them to Italy. The statues, one of which is shown above, arrived in Rome on Friday along with nine classical antiquities from the private collection of the New York philanthropist Shelby White that were ceded to Italy in January under a separate pact. Italy says Ms. White’s artifacts were also looted from Italian soil."

2008-02-26T00:00:00Z,"Putting pixels on body parts didn’t save Fox from the wrath of the Federal Communications Commission. The agency has rejected the network’s contention that an episode of the defunct reality program “Married to America” did not violate decency standards because female breasts and buttocks were pixelized during a raunchy bachelor party scene in 2003, Reuters reported. The commission said: “To be sure, the pixelation of the female strippers’ naked breasts and buttocks does render the material less explicit and graphic than it would have been in the absence of pixilation. However, the material is still sufficiently graphic and explicit to support and indecency ruling.” Fox disagreed. The commission, acting against only those stations subjected to complaints, fined 13 stations and affiliates $7,000 each. Last week it fined ABC stations and affiliates a total of $1.2 million for showing a woman’s bare buttock during an episode of “N.Y.P.D. Blue” in 2003. ABC paid but will appeal. The Supreme Court is expected to consider on Friday if it will hear the F.C.C.’s appeal of an appeals court decision that declared its rulings against fleeting profanities to be “arbitrary and capricious.”."
2008-02-26T00:00:00Z,"The Museums Association, founded in 1889 to represent Britain’s museums and galleries, reversed a 30-year ban on selling art and urged its 1,500 members on Monday to get rid of objects that are gathering dust, the BBC reported. “Museums typically collect a thousand times as many things as they get rid of,” Mark Taylor, the association’s director, said in a posting on its Web site (museumsassociation.org.). “Wonderful collections can become a burden unless they are cleared of unused objects.” The association told its members to give unused art to other museums or public institutions or, in exceptional circumstances, to sell it. The organization expressed hope that its new policy would encourage museums to put some pieces on display, and said it expected only a few sales each year. Vanessa Trevelyan, convener of the association’s ethics committee and head of Norfolk Museum and Archaeology Service, said, “Although disposal of items is not without risk, it is preferable to transfer items to an alternative home where they will be treasured, rather than retain material that is not supporting a museum’s research, display or interpretation functions.”."

Composed by Darren Smith and Simon Fine, the song includes the lyrics: “Shake your feathers and pop your beak, shake it to the west and to the east, wave Euro-hands and Euro-feet, wave them in the air to the turkey beat,” The Times of London reported. Ireland has won the contest a record seven times, including three straight in the 1990s, but finished last in 2007 in Helsinki.

But hot on the heels of the announcement, reported on Monday in The Beijing News, came critics who complained on the Internet that untrained teachers and forced instruction might discourage students from this 200-year-old art, characterized by complex gestures and trilling vocals. An Internet user who called himself Little Monkey, said, “If the students are forced to learn, it might backfire and make them totally lose interest.”."

2008-02-26T00:00:00Z,"LEHMAN--Orin, educator, philanthropist, civil rights advocate and conservationist with a life-long commitment to public service, died February 22, 2008. He died peacefully at home in New York City surrounded by his loving family and friends. The cause of death was pneumonia. Born January 14, 1920, he was 88. He was the son of the late Allan Sigmund and Evelyn Schiffer Lehman, and the brother of the late Ellen Lehman Long. He was the great-grandson of Mayer Lehman, founder of Lehman Brothers investment house, and grandnephew of Herbert Lehman, the former Governor of New York and U.S. Senator. Mr. Lehman grew up in Tarrytown, NY, graduated from the Scarborough and The Taft Schools, Princeton University and New York University where he earned masters and doctorate degrees in American history.In World War II, Lehman was an Army pilot with the rank of Captain. He was badly wounded in Germany during the Battle of the Bulge and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Purple Heart. In 1947 he partnered with Eleanor Roosevelt and Bernard Baruch, and founded Just One Break (JOB), whose mission is to find competitive employment for people with disabilities. JOB is the nations's oldest not-for-profit employment service for people with disabilities. Over half a century after founding it, Orin Lehman remained Chairman Emeritus of its board of directors until his death. Mr. Lehman's first public appointment came in 1950 when President Truman appointed him to the advisory board of the Economic Cooperation Administration where he succeeded his great-uncle Herbert Lehman. In 1952, while an associate in the Lehman Brothers firm, he was designated New York City's Outstanding Young Man of the Year by the Junior Chamber of Commerce. While prominently engaged in public life, Lehman explored a variety of careers. He served as an economic adviser to the U.S. mission at the United Nations, became the Chairman of the New York Board of Corrections, and published weekly newspapers. He served as Chairman of the Board of the New School of Social Research for ten years, where he also taught. In the 1970's he produced theatrical plays offBroadway, among them two hits by Jules Feiffer and the Pulitzer Prize winning play ''The Effects of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds'' by Paul Zindel. In 1975, Gov. Hugh L. Carey offered Mr. Lehman the job of Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation which he accepted, calling it ''The greatest job in the world.'' He was re-appointed by Governor Mario Cuomo, and by the time he retired in 1993, he had served 18 years as Commissioner, the longest period of any individual in that position. Mr. Lehman understood the value that parks would play not only in lives of New Yorkers, but also their overall benefit to the environment. His highest priority was making parks and open spaces accessible to all, long before it was the fashion and the law of the land. He was loved and respected by state park employees who affectionately called him ''Father Nature.'' During his tenure, the Empire State Summer and Winter Games, Senior Games and Games for the Physically Challenged were created. In addition to his public service, Mr. Lehman lived life to the fullest, playing golf, flying airplanes, and never letting his need for crutches interfere with his active schedule. Mr. Lehman was Chairman of the Board of Governors of the American Jewish Committee, a trustee of the Taft School, where he received the Citation of Merit Award, a director for UNESCO, 1968-1971 (United Nations Educational, Scientific & Cultural Organization), a director of the Educational Broadcasting Corporation, 1965-1974, a trustee of the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Foundation and a member of The Council on Foreign Relations. He was, until his death, a member of The Century Association in New York City. He was a soft-spoken man with a quiet bearing which belied his sense of humor and fun-loving nature. He will be greatly missed by his friends and family. Mr. Lehman was married to the late Jane Bagley Lehman and is survived by his former wife, Wendy Vanderbilt Lehman, his three daughters, Susan Lehman Carmichael (Mrs. Trent) of Greenwich, CT, Brooke Lehman and Sage Lehman of New York City and his four grandchildren Avery, Haley, Ryan and Whitney Carmichael. His companion Monique Van Vooren and his beloved Boston Terrier, Snookums, also survive him. A Memorial service will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, New York City on Tuesday, February 26th at 5:00pm. The Rabbi Ronald Sobel will officiate. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations may be made to Just One Break (JOB), 570 Seventh Ave, NY, NY 10018. www.justonebreak.com"

2008-02-26T00:00:00Z,"RUBIN--Albert L., M.D. The Board of Directors of The Rogosin Institute deeply mourns the passing of Dr. Albert L. Rubin. Dr. Rubin was the first nephrologist in New York to provide kidney dialysis (1956) and renal transplantation (1963). To implement his comprehensive, integrative approach to kidney disease, he created The Rogosin Institute, an affiliate of the New York - Presbyterian Health care System, 25 years ago and had been The Institute's President and Chief Executive Officer since then. He provided the remarkable vision, leadership and compassion that are the heart of The Institute's clinical and research programs. The Rogosin Institute now provides comprehensive treatment of renal disease for thousands of patients. In addition to his work as a physician and teacher, Dr. Rubin had initiated and shepherded The Institute's major research programs in renal disease, diabetes, lipid disorders and cancer. From the beginning of his extraordinary career he had promoted bringing basic research to the bedside as rapidly as possible in order to improve patient care and quality of life. His extraordinary vitality, enthusiasm and wisdom have nurtured The Rogosin Institute and enriched all those who have worked with him. He will be deeply missed. RUBIN--Albert L. M.D. The Medical Staff and Employees of The Rogosin Institute mourn the passing of its founder and leader, Albert L. Rubin, M.D., who served as Director of The Institute from its founding until his death on February 23, 2008. We came to know him as a compassionate physician, accomplished scientist, wise teacher, and friend to us all. His vision and leadership created an Institute of which we are all extremely proud. The combination of the very best in patient care and innovative research programs to make that care even better was central to that vision. He made The Institute an exciting place to work, and we are glad to be part of it. We will miss Dr. Rubin deeply, but count on his example and inspiration to help us continue and expand the work of The Institute so that we can help many thousands more patients in the years to come. We share his dream of ending kidney disease as we now know it. We believe that his dream is one that can be realized, and we plan to work hard to achieve that. We cannot think of a better way to honor his memory. RUBIN--Albert L., M.D., a physician, researcher and executive of Englewood, NJ, died peacefully at home on February 23. He founded and led The Rogosin Institute, affiliated with New York-Presbyterian Hospital, from its inception in 1983 to his death, building The Institute into a world renowned treatment and research organization specializing in kidney disease. Born May 9, 1927, he attended Williams College from 1944 to 1945 and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received his medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1950. In 1957, he and his team performed the first hemodialysis for the treatment of kidney failure in the New York metropolitan area. In 1962, the unit became known as the Renal Laboratory located at the Cornell Division at Bellevue Hospital before moving to The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where it expanded to the Rogosin Renal Laboratories and to The Rogosin Institute in 1983. A true visionary, he pioneered the advancement of the treatment of kidney disease and spearheaded promising research and treatment programs in lipid disorders, diabetes and cancer. He was a talented physician and researcher who not only foresaw the future of medicine and the true purpose of research, but understood that collaboration and cooperation among institutions and organizations was necessary in order to bring developments to patients as quickly as possible. He will be remembered by many as a talented leader and inspirational mentor. He married Carolyn Diehl, M.D., in 1953, who preceded him in death by 20 months. He is survived by son Marc Rubin, M.D., his wife, Jennifer and three grandchildren, Sara, Matthew and Bryan. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in his memory to The Rogosin Institute, 505 E. 70th Street, New York, NY 10021. A private service will be held Saturday, March 1. Family and friends are invited to the home of Marc and Jennifer Rubin, 130 Walnut St., Englewood, on March 1 from 3 to 6 pm."

More than $500,000 of debt and competition from chain stores and online vendors led Doug Dutton, the owner, to announce his plans to close in a statement on the store’s Web site (duttonsbrentwood.com) on Tuesday. The property owners, Nancy and Charles T. Munger, said in a statement to The Los Angeles Times that they would allow Dutton’s to remain open rent-free through its liquidation."

In a face-lift reminiscent of the modernization of the Louvre in Paris, the Rijksmuseum, designed by Pierre Cuypers (1827-1921) and opened in 1885, is to have a huge new underground entrance hall. Since the main building closed, in 2003, paintings by Rembrandt, Frans Hals and Vermeer have remained on view in a wing."

I can still see us walking hand in hand through our neighborhood.” Anne Frank died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp the next year.

Now president of Sony’s worldwide game development studios, Mr. Harrison announced on Monday that he would resign Friday. Mr. Harrison joined Sony in 1992 and has become perhaps the most public face of the company’s game business. After dominating the last generation of gaming with its PlayStation 2, the company has failed to maintain its leadership more recently with the PlayStation 3 amid new challenges from its rivals Microsoft and Nintendo. The company said that Kazuo Hirai, Mr. Harrison’s boss as chief executive of Sony’s overall game unit, would assume Mr. Harrison’s duties. Mr. Harrison raised eyebrows in the game industry last week when he criticized Sony’s failure to recognize the growth of casual, social gaming. Nintendo has embraced that trend while Sony has largely focused on complicated, sometimes violent fare directed at young men."

Dr. Rubin was the first nephrologist in New York to provide kidney dialysis (1956) and renal transplantation (1963). To implement his comprehensive, integrative approach to kidney disease, he created The Rogosin Institute, an affiliate of the New York - Presbyterian Health care System, 25 years ago and had been The Institute's President and Chief Executive Officer since then. He provided the remarkable vision, leadership and compassion that are the heart of The Institute's clinical and research programs. The Rogosin Institute now provides comprehensive treatment of renal disease for thousands of patients. In addition to his work as a physician and teacher, Dr. Rubin had initiated and shepherded The Institute's major research programs in renal disease, diabetes, lipid disorders and cancer. From the beginning of his extraordinary career he had promoted bringing basic research to the bedside as rapidly as possible in order to improve patient care and quality of life. His extraordinary vitality, enthusiasm and wisdom have nurtured The Rogosin Institute and enriched all those who have worked with him. He will be deeply missed. RUBIN--Albert, M.D. We are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend and colleague Dr. Albert Rubin. The founder and director of The Rogosin Institute, a medical partner of New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell, he was professor of surgery, medicine and biochemistry at Weill Cornell Medical College, where he received his medical degree and served as alumni association president. Beginning in the 1950s, Dr. Rubin was central to the introduction of dialysis and kidney transplantation to New York, helping to extend and improve the lives of countless patients. Today, as a result of his remarkable leadership, Rogosin is one of the world's largest kidney programs, performing more than 100,000 dialyses every year. A national and international advocate for organ donation and for making treatment affordable, he arranged the first kidney transplant between a Russian donor and a U.S. recipient, in 1977. A brilliant researcher, mentor and clinician, he inspired us with his steadfast dedication and compassion for his patients. Together with his wife, the late Dr. Carolyn Diehl, he contributed greatly to the life of our medical center. We offer our heartfelt condolences to the Rubin family, including his son, Marc, and three grandchildren. Antonio M. Gotto, Jr., M.D. Dean Weill Cornell Medical College Herbert Pardes, M.D. President and CEO NY-Presbyterian Hospital RUBIN--Dr. Albert L. The Rockefeller University community deeply mourns the loss of our cherished friend Dr. Albert L. Rubin. A true visionary in the field of medical research, he created The Rogosin Institute and built it into one of New York City's leading research centers, specializing in kidney disease but encompassing pioneering investigations into cancer, diabetes, and other pressing health concerns. Long before others embraced the concept of inter-institutional collaboration, he understood that advances in scientific research and medicine would only come from such sharing of knowledge, and he reached out to establish partnerships with other academic and medical research centers. We at Rockefeller were privileged to be among them. Together with his late wife, Dr. Carolyn Diehl, he will long be remembered as an example of the very best that the medical profession can aspire to. We will cherish their memories and seek to honor them through our work. Our deepest condolences are sent to the Rubin and Diehl families, and to the investigators and staff of The Rogosin Institute. Paul Nurse, President Torsten N. Wiesel, President Emeritus Barry S. Coller, Physician-in-Chief Russell L. Carson, Chair David Rockefeller, Honorary Chair RUBIN--Albert L. M.D. The Medical Staff and Employees of The Rogosin Institute mourn the passing of its founder and leader, Albert L. Rubin, M.D., who served as Director of The Institute from its founding until his death on February 23, 2008.

The combination of the very best in patient care and innovative research programs to make that care even better was central to that vision. He made The Institute an exciting place to work, and we are glad to be part of it. We will miss Dr. Rubin deeply, but count on his example and inspiration to help us continue and expand the work of The Institute so that we can help many thousands more patients in the years to come. We share his dream of ending kidney disease as we now know it. We believe that his dream is one that can be realized, and we plan to work hard to achieve that. We cannot think of a better way to honor his memory. RUBIN--Albert L., M.D., a physician, researcher and executive of Englewood, NJ, died peacefully at home on February 23. He founded and led The Rogosin Institute, affiliated with New York-Presbyterian Hospital, from its inception in 1983 to his death, building The Institute into a world renowned treatment and research organization specializing in kidney disease. Born May 9, 1927, he attended Williams College from 1944 to 1945 and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received his medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1950. In 1957, he and his team performed the first hemodialysis for the treatment of kidney failure in the New York metropolitan area. In 1962, the unit became known as the Renal Laboratory located at the Cornell Division at Bellevue Hospital before moving to The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where it expanded to the Rogosin Renal Laboratories and to The Rogosin Institute in 1983. A true visionary, he pioneered the advancement of the treatment of kidney disease and spearheaded promising research and treatment programs in lipid disorders, diabetes and cancer. He was a talented physician and researcher who not only foresaw the future of medicine and the true purpose of research, but understood that collaboration and cooperation among institutions and organizations was necessary in order to bring developments to patients as quickly as possible. He will be remembered by many as a talented leader and inspirational mentor. He married Carolyn Diehl, M.D., in 1953, who preceded him in death by 20 months. He is survived by son Marc Rubin, M.D., his wife, Jennifer and three grandchildren, Sara, Matthew and Bryan. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in his memory to The Rogosin Institute, 505 E. 70th Street, New York, NY 10021. A private service will be held Saturday, March 1. Family and friends are invited to the home of Marc and Jennifer Rubin, 130 Walnut St., Englewood, on March 1 from 3 to 6 pm. --Albert L., M.D. He was a pioneer in the treatment of kidney disease; a founder and leader of the pre-eminent Rogosin Institute; a visionary in patient care and research to cure a wide variety of severe illnesses. Dr. Rubin uniquely combined intellectual power, compassion, humor, force of personality and leadership ability. He left a model to follow for Rogosin's Medical staff, Employees and Board of Directors, and the medical profession; and he left to the echoes of applause from thousands of patients. Henry J. Leir, our late founder, was his close friend, kindred spirit and admirer. The Leir Charitable Foundations"

Pilati carries forward the simplified lines of the spring collection and now adds more sex appeal, more flare to the geometry. The collection has a lot of versaility, but your eye goes immediately to the straight shoulders of unlined, cutaway coats in Donegal tweeds and then to the succinct volumes at the hem.

2008-02-28T17:04:57Z,"Eight years ago, I traveled the country with Ralph Nader. He was sardonic and surprisingly funny. As we drove through post-industrial landscapes of depressing sameness, Mr. Nader kept up a constant monologue about the spiritual costs of box stores and fast food. I recall standing at an airport counter - it was Sioux Falls, or maybe Fargo - where the agent cheerfully informed Mr. Nader that he had been upgraded to first class; he protested vigorously and smoldered the entire flight home. After Mr. Nader was tossed out of the presidential debate site in Boston, he and I watched the next debate in front of the TV at the brownstone that was his Washington headquarters. I ate pizza as Mr. Nader paced the room trying out phantom debate lines and railing against the two ""corporate supremacists"" on stage, who, he pointed out, refused to mention the plight of the working poor, the tilt of the political system toward special interests, the human toll of free trade. Mr. Nader's candidacy took a dark turn in the closing weeks of the 2000 campaign. Until then, he had been running primarily to get the 5 percent of the vote he needed to qualify the Green Party for matching funds. But then Mr. Nader's consuming resentment - at the way leading Democrats pressured his friends to denounce him, at the way Al Gore refused to speak his name - seemed to possess him, and at some point he seemed to make it his mission to deny Mr. Gore the presidency, attacking his Democratic rival in swing states over the protests of his own aides. I've always thought that Mr. Gore probably could have avoided what came next simply by picking up the phone in those final weeks and making some small gesture of respect toward the man. But he didn't, and Mr. Nader got his wish."

He shrugged. ""It's critic-proof,"" he said, and made a round motion with his hands. No point of critical entry.

The one difference between Pure Coffee and the movie is that this scent is excellent."

2008-02-28T00:00:00Z,"RUBIN--Albert L., M.D. The Board of Directors of The Rogosin Institute deeply mourns the passing of Dr. Albert L. Rubin. Dr. Rubin was the first nephrologist in New York to provide kidney dialysis (1956) and renal transplantation (1963). To implement his comprehensive, integrative approach to kidney disease, he created The Rogosin Institute, an affiliate of the New York - Presbyterian Health care System, 25 years ago and had been The Institute's President and Chief Executive Officer since then. He provided the remarkable vision, leadership and compassion that are the heart of The Institute's clinical and research programs. The Rogosin Institute now provides comprehensive treatment of renal disease for thousands of patients. In addition to his work as a physician and teacher, Dr. Rubin had initiated and shepherded The Institute's major research programs in renal disease, diabetes, lipid disorders and cancer. From the beginning of his extraordinary career he had promoted bringing basic research to the bedside as rapidly as possible in order to improve patient care and quality of life. His extraordinary vitality, enthusiasm and wisdom have nurtured The Rogosin Institute and enriched all those who have worked with him. He will be deeply missed. RUBIN--Albert L., M.D., a physician, researcher and executive of Englewood, NJ, died peacefully at home on February 23. He founded and led The Rogosin Institute, affiliated with New York-Presbyterian Hospital, from its inception in 1983 to his death, building The Institute into a world renowned treatment and research organization specializing in kidney disease. Born May 9, 1927, he attended Williams College from 1944 to 1945 and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received his medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1950. In 1957, he and his team performed the first hemodialysis for the treatment of kidney failure in the New York metropolitan area. In 1962, the unit became known as the Renal Laboratory located at the Cornell Division at Bellevue Hospital before moving to The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where it expanded to the Rogosin Renal Laboratories and to The Rogosin Institute in 1983. A true visionary, he pioneered the advancement of the treatment of kidney disease and spearheaded promising research and treatment programs in lipid disorders, diabetes and cancer. He was a talented physician and researcher who not only foresaw the future of medicine and the true purpose of research, but understood that collaboration and cooperation among institutions and organizations was necessary in order to bring developments to patients as quickly as possible. He will be remembered by many as a talented leader and inspirational mentor. He married Carolyn Diehl, M.D., in 1953, who preceded him in death by 20 months. He is survived by son Marc Rubin, M.D., his wife, Jennifer and three grandchildren, Sara, Matthew and Bryan. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in his memory to The Rogosin Institute, 505 E. 70th Street, New York, NY 10021. A private service will be held Saturday, March 1. Family and friends are invited to the home of Marc and Jennifer Rubin, 130 Walnut St., Englewood, on March 1 from 3 to 6 pm. RUBIN--Albert L. M.D. The Medical Staff and Employees of The Rogosin Institute mourn the passing of its founder and leader, Albert L. Rubin, M.D., who served as Director of The Institute from its founding until his death on February 23, 2008. We came to know him as a compassionate physician, accomplished scientist, wise teacher, and friend to us all. His vision and leadership created an Institute of which we are all extremely proud. The combination of the very best in patient care and innovative research programs to make that care even better was central to that vision. He made The Institute an exciting place to work, and we are glad to be part of it. We will miss Dr. Rubin deeply, but count on his example and inspiration to help us continue and expand the work of The Institute so that we can help many thousands more patients in the years to come. We share his dream of ending kidney disease as we now know it. We believe that his dream is one that can be realized, and we plan to work hard to achieve that. We cannot think of a better way to honor his memory."

A talented, accomplished, intelligent woman, Liz's singular personality brought joy to all who knew her. Born in New York City, she was raised in Miami, Florida, where she found and nurtured her first great passion, the piano. A New Yorker at heart, she always seemed to find her way back to the Big Apple. After graduating from Barnard College in 1988 with a degree in political science, Liz, who loved travel, circled the globe as a successful journalist. Starting out as a news writer in Miami and local on-camera reporter in Tallahassee, Florida, she doggedly worked her way up the ranks, eventually landing positions in Hong Kong and Singapore as an anchor for Asia Business News and in New York as a producer for CNNfn. In her mid-30s, Liz decided to shake things up and pursue yet another lifelong love, cooking. She co-wrote The Great Big Burger Book and took immense pleasure in showering family and friends with her culinary delights. Her great pride were the elaborate birthday cakes she lovingly created for her daughter Maya's birthday parties. Since 2006, Elizabeth has proudly served on the Board of Trustees of her alma mater, Barnard College.

2008-02-28T00:00:00Z,"Horigan Urban Forest Products in Skokie, Ill., sells a variety of hardwoods, including black alder, silver maple and elm from trees in and around Chicago downed by storms, disease or construction. The company was founded in 2003 by Erika and Bruce Horigan, below, who were horrified to see trees going into wood chippers. They now have so much inventory that they recently expanded into a 4,200-square-foot warehouse. Prices are competitive with other hardwood sources (one-inch-thick quartersawn white oak, for example, is $5.50 a board foot), and the wood comes tagged with notes like ''Hackberry planted in Washington Park by Frederick Law Olmsted in 1873.'' ''One of the coolest things about my job is keeping the trees' stories alive,'' Mr. Horigan said. Information: (847) 568-1340 or horiganufp.com. LISA CREGAN"

That was the essence of a court ruling on Thursday in Bergen, Norway, where the Grammy-winning Ms. Winehouse was scheduled to appear on Friday, Agence France-Presse reported. “One of the people involved in the case, Blake Fielder-Civil, Amy Winehouse’s husband, is currently in jail in Britain and can’t make the trip,” said Anne Vedvik of the Bergen court. “The hearing has therefore been postponed to an undetermined date.” Ms. Winehouse, 24, her husband and her hairdresser were arrested in Bergen in October and charged with possessing a quarter-ounce of marijuana. Ms. Winehouse was released after paying a $756 fine, which she later contested. Agreeing to a fine in Norway is equivalent to admitting the charges, which could make it difficult for Ms. Winehouse to obtain visas. Mr. Fielder-Civil has been in custody since November, awaiting trial on charges of assault and conspiracy to pervert the cause of justice. He is accused of trying to bribe a barman not to testify against him in an assault case. ...

Appearing in a London court under his real name, George O’Dowd, he pleaded not guilty to a charge of false imprisonment lodged by Audun Carlsen, who claimed that he was handcuffed to a wall after he went to Boy George’s apartment in April as a photo model.

2008-02-29T00:00:00Z,"WINTER REP 2008 While a season of plays presented in rotating repertory is common practice in summer stock, it is not the norm in the Off Off Broadway world. But the Oberon Theater Ensemble, now in its 11th season, has been presenting shows this way for a few years, and its current offerings include ''Macbeth,'' with James Holloway, above left, and William Laney, and Michael Weller's ''Ghost on Fire.'' ''The two plays, if you have to boil it down to one word, are about ambition,'' said Brad Fryman, Oberon's artistic director. ''Macbeth's ambition comes from an unnatural place, and 'Ghost on Fire' is about these young people who entered the professional world and thought they could change it through film.'' The three central characters in Mr. Weller's 1985 play had grand plans when they were documentary filmmakers in college, but haven't reached their goals 15 years later. In comparison, it is not much of a stretch to guess that Shakespeare's Scottish Thane was once an idealistic young man too, before his motives darkened."

2008-02-29T00:00:00Z,"KEELY GARFIELD At a recent rehearsal for her latest dance, ''Limerence,'' Keely Garfield recounted a conversation with her fellow choreographer Reggie Wilson about how unnerving it is to make and perform her emotionally intense works. ''Why don't you make a happy dance?'' Mr. Wilson asked, and then the good friends dissolved into giggles. ''I still have really high expectations that I'll make a happy dance one day,'' Ms. Garfield says. ''Limerence,'' a duet for her and Omagbitse Omagbemi, is not that dance, though this dark, prayerful meditation on affairs of the heart is shot through with her subtly mordant wit. Both women are fluid, smart movers, and Ms. Garfield is capable of producing tautly structured dances. Yet what captivates here is the awkward, uncomfortable space these dancers inhabit as they alternately minister to and grapple with each other. Ms. Garfield, left, gives her ideas a lot of space, and much of the action takes place in the loaded gazes the two level at each other; thankfully, the West End Theater is small, so viewers can get a close look."

2008-02-29T00:00:00Z,"'YEAR OF THE RAT' Kim Jones's war-torn, fluently hybrid art is more germane than ever, as proved by his latest exhibition at Pierogi. His primary theme, directly or indirectly, is war and its toxic effects, a subject inspired partly by his experiences as a marine in Vietnam. Mr. Jones erupted on the Los Angeles performance-art scene in the mid-1970s in the persona of Mudman, a shaman-warrior-penitent covered in mud and harnessed with a bristling mass of sticks. In the first room several stick apparatuses hang far apart on the walls, part forbidding traps, part power figures. Wavy-lined wall drawings flow between them like currents of attract-repel energy. Their dates reflect Mr. Jones's tendency to mend, resurface and refresh continually. The much-painted ''Rat Dog'' (1973-1980-1986-1998-2008), above, is at once a headdress, an effigy and a figure in a prison stock; it belongs to a rodent art tradition stretching from Disney's Mickey Mouse to Art Spiegelman's Maus."

After graduating from Barnard College in 1988 with a degree in political science, Liz, who loved travel, circled the globe as a successful journalist. Starting out as a news writer in Miami and local on-camera reporter in Tallahassee, Florida, she doggedly worked her way up the ranks, eventually landing positions in Hong Kong and Singapore as an anchor for Asia Business News and in New York as a producer for CNNfn. In her mid-30s, Liz decided to shake things up and pursue yet another lifelong love, cooking. She co-wrote The Great Big Burger Book and took immense pleasure in showering family and friends with her culinary delights. Her great pride were the elaborate birthday cakes she lovingly created for her daughter Maya's birthday parties. Since 2006, Elizabeth has proudly served on the Board of Trustees of her alma mater, Barnard College. Elizabeth is survived by her husband Ravi, their adored daughter Maya, her parents Dr. Billy and Lydia Yeh, her brothers Brian and William, sisters-in-law Alicia and Gaylan, niece Sabrina, nephew William, and countless cherished friends.

2008-02-29T00:00:00Z,"SFJAZZ COLLECTIVE Transition has come again to the SFJAZZ Collective, an eight-piece band established in 2004 by the Bay Area arts organization SFJAZZ. For its first few years, the ensemble, which combines jazz repertory with original music by its members, had a clear public representative in the tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman. Then Mr. Redman bowed out of the band, with what seemed like a hint of relief. (His excellent Nonesuch album ''Back East,'' issued last year, gave the feeling of a big exhalation: Mr. Redman sounded appreciative to be making music with no larger responsibilities, projecting only himself.) Happily for everyone -- including Mr. Redman, who still serves as artistic director of the SFJAZZ spring season -- the collective has continued to thrive. The tenor saxophone chair now belongs to Joe Lovano, a worthy replacement with the proper perspective on jazz tradition and innovation. (In brief: a balance of each is best.) The band includes (from left, above) the vibraphonist Stefon Harris, the alto saxophonist Miguel Zenón, Mr. Lovano, the trombonist Robin Eubanks, the bassist Matt Penman, the trumpeter Dave Douglas, the pianist Renee Rosnes and the drummer Eric Harland. All together this crew represents not just a slate of improvisational all-stars but also a contemporary composers' club."

2008-02-29T00:00:00Z,"'HANSEL AND GRETEL' Make that Hank and Gertie. In this new musical from Manhattan Children's Theater the fairy tale has lost its Germanic tone in favor of an Appalachian twang. But even though the characters are thoroughly Americanized, the only sugarcoating remains on the witch's house. This story is still Grimm, and even a little grim. Written by a sister-and-brother team, Kristin Walter (book and lyrics) and Michael Walter (music), ''Hansel and Gretel'' begins with the old-fashioned narrative, as it is told to the siblings Hank and Gertie by their impoverished parents. But these down-on-their-luck mining folks can't finish the tale before bedtime. When the children go berry picking the next day, life slowly and insidiously begins to imitate art, at least after they relate the half-told story to a kindly woman in the woods. (You don't have to be a grown-up to figure out who she really is.)"

Or is it sevice journalism - is this piece of entertainment worth 47 bucks of your hard earned cash? (That's the median price paid for a Broadway ticket, by the way.)

Should they be held responsible to anybody or anything, or can they just write with a free hand, and be loose cannons for life, some of them?"

2008-03-02T00:00:00Z,"OUTPOSTS To win this election, as always, a candidate will need the most consistent voter: the reliable senior. In the last presidential election, one in four voters were over 60. That math would seem to favor Senator John McCain -- ''older than dirt, with more scars than Frankenstein,'' as he used to joke. McCain turns 72 in August, which means if he's elected, he would be the oldest president to enter the White House. (Ronald Reagan was 69 when he became president.) But McCain faces a mountain of doubt about people his age running the country. Only about 5 percent of Americans say they would refuse to vote for a black person. About 11 percent say they would not vote for a woman. And a whopping 42 percent -- according to Gallup -- say they would have trouble voting for someone age 72 or older."

The Blue Lagoon is hot springs; you can't see from the picture but around the pool and outside it's actually quite beautiful. The water also looks much nicer from outside, much more blue. The bad side about the Blue Lagoon is that it smells terribly. But we went another place where there also were hot springs, and the smell was worse. After the trip I felt much better, mentally but also physically; still I was sad about our breakup.

This unique product created a major worldwide solid surface industry, which has grown every year for the last 40 years and now consists of dozens of products and manufacturers. In the biological sciences, Dr. Slocum was among the earliest researchers to propose and demonstrate the role of free radicals as agents in stimulated and aberrant growth of cells. He was a prolific inventor and creative scientist with several patented inventions. He also served in executive leadership roles in several major corporations, including DuPont, Hoffman La Roche, Curtiss-Wright, and Masonite, from which he retired as Senior Vice President of Technology. He also was a writer, lecturer and teacher during his highly active career. Dr. Slocum was born in Flushing, NY, and received degrees from Davis & Elkins College in West Virginia, the University of Vermont, and The Ohio State University. Dr. Slocum served in the Korean conflict in the 194th Engineer Combat Battalion and retired from the U.S. Army reserves as a Colonel after 30 years of service. He was highly decorated for his service and will be interred in the Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, DC. Don was an inspired scientist, a talented executive, a gentleman in every sense of the word, and an inspiration to others.

One year, the game was said to have figured in some 37 divorce cases in Britain, which is patently ridiculous for the simple reason that it suggests there are 37 Brits who don't play Football Manager. Here in the United States, Worldwide Soccer Manager ($29.99, Macintosh and Windows XP), as the game is known, arrived last fall as a far less mainstream proposition. But it has managed to find a following in the growing American community of soccer-mad brainiacs. The game features real players and real teams, with the user calling the shots from the front office and the sidelines. You control nearly every aspect of the game -- tactics, transfers, pep talks, press manipulation -- but the game itself, which unfolds as a clash of scurrying colored dots, looks like an ant farm with crowd noise."

I half expected some researcher had claimed to have found a play gene. It is not enough to look at comparative brain studies. The interest generated by Brown's lecture at the New York Public Library calls for the addition of a more reflective approach from the social sciences and philosophy. Plato observed that play was a given quality of animal nature. In ''The Laws,'' he wrote that all young animals ''leap and bound, they dance and frolic, as it were with glee.''"

2008-03-03T00:00:00Z,"Unlike pitches that challenge batters with overpowering speed (fastball) or change of direction (curve, slider), the changeup is all about deception. When thrown with the expertise of Johan Santana, the changeup offers only a fleeting visual key for the batter to use to identify the pitch and to react accordingly. Batters mainly have two opportunities to decipher a pitch: by getting a glimpse of the pitcher's grip (and sometimes his body position) and by reading the pattern that the seams on the ball create. Santana's changeup delivery looks like that of his fastball or his slider. So the batter starts his swing quickly to catch up to a 90-mile-an-hour pitch, only to realize -- often too late -- that it is a changeup traveling much more slowly and diving out of the strike zone. Whiff!"

In one episode of the series, “The F.B.I. at 100,” a former F.B.I. agent, Mark Young, said that Angels became enraged in the aftermath of the Rolling Stones’ free concert at Altamont. During the concert a fan was stabbed and killed by the Angels, who had been providing security for the Stones. The Stones then distanced themselves from the Angels, which made the Angels angry with Mr. Jagger, the program said. “They were going to kill him in retribution for his firing their security forces,” Mr. Young said in the program, the BBC reported on its Web site. “Their plan involved making entry into his Long Island property, going by boat. As they gathered the weaponry and their forces to go out on Long Island Sound, a storm rolled up, which nearly sunk the watercraft they were in, and they escaped with their own lives.” Mr. Young told the program that the botched plot came to life much later, in the course of a wider investigation into the Angels’ activities. The episode is to be broadcast next week. A spokesman for Mr. Jagger said he would have no comment."

It chronicles the fate of a Muslim man who moves to Hamburg to enroll in medical school but because of his murky background ends up being followed by both local and other Western intelligence agencies. “It’s John le Carré, so of course you don’t know who to trust,” Susan Moldow, publisher of Scribner, said. “You don’t know who’s telling the truth. It’s wonderful mind games and also very reflective of how intelligence communities operate.” Michael Rudell, the lawyer who negotiated the Scribner deal for Mr. le Carré, declined to comment on the size of the advance but said it was a “very significant deal.”."

CBS placed third, as strong showings by “Two and a Half Men” (9.9 million at 9) and “CSI: Miami” (9.2 million at 10) offset lower-rated sitcoms like the new series “Welcome to the Captain” (5.6 million at 8:30).

2008-03-05T00:00:00Z,"NASSBERG--Jack, ended his journey of almost 93 years on Monday, March 03, 2008, in Indianapolis. He is survived by his loving family, including his wife of 55 years, Ruth Ellen of Tamarac, Florida and Haifa, Israel; his son, Barry, of Hong Kong and daughter, Michele, of Indianapolis; their spouses Nancy Wright and Gadi Boukai and adoring grandchildren Ben-Ari, Maya Tani and Victoria Ellen. He leaves also his devoted nephew Dr. Barton Nassberg, of Freehold, New Jersey, son of his beloved brother Max, sadly missed since 1971. Jack was a modern-day Renaissance man, whose life was shaped by tragedy, instinct for survival, great drive and a passion for education. He was a teacher, soldier, journalist, businessman and writer. A speaker of seven languages, most self-taught, he thrived on his keen understanding of the history of his people, and his passion for sharing it with others. Born in 1915 in Mikulince, in the Galicia region of the Austro-Hungary Empire, later a part of Poland, Jack experienced the horrors of the Holocaust when both his parents and sister perished during the invasion of his home town. Having already been drafted into the Polish Army, chance saved him from the fate of his family. Thus began a journey of escape from the Nazi advance that would take him through Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Persia. It would see him imprisoned by the Soviets in a labor camp, a further escape, and an eventual race to freedom. He would later in life devote years to recording his harrowing tale in a book of his war-time exploits. As a journalist in Italy in the post-war years, he traveled to Palestine on assignment, where he met his wife-to-be, Ruth Ellen, herself a survivor and refugee. They would marry in 1953. Jack eventually joined his brother Max, who had already immigrated to the USA, and entered the retail trade. Along with a cousin, Michael Lehrer, they would develop MacRae's Shops, a group of successful ladies wear stores in Queens and Brooklyn, New York. These thrived, and allowed Jack to realize his dream of re-building his life in his adopted and beloved country. A firm advocate of the Zionist ideal, Jack was a founding leader of the youth movement ''Gordonia''. He later supported organizations that promoted American assistance for Israel. He believed in the shared responsibility of the Diaspora to ensure a viable Israel, thus assuring the future of the Jewish people, no matter where they lived. Along with their Tamarac, Florida residence, Jack and his wife maintained a second home in Haifa, Israel, periodically spending time there. Both his children are graduates of Haifa secondary schools. Jack was the solid foundation of a dynamic family. A source of great inspiration to his children, he instilled in them a love of knowledge and education, commitment and a great sense of work ethic. He led by example, showing what could be achieved through hard work and devotion. He was the patriarch of the extended Nassberg family, an endless source of historical minutiae, whether on topics of politics or world affairs, faith and tradition, or the obscure roots of the family. He was an active member and officer of the Mikulincer Sick and Benevolent Association, a landsmanschaft (immigrants society) founded in 1899 and devoted to the well being of immigrants from his home town. He served as their President for almost thirty years. In recent years he meticulously researched and wrote a book on the genealogy of the Nassberg clan, providing the younger generation with a detailed look at the family's European origins. In 1993 Jack, accompanied by his wife and son, took his first trip back to his roots, visiting his home town (today located in the Ukraine) for the first time since the war. It would help bring closure to events that had defined his life. In 2004 Jack suffered a major stroke, paralyzing much of his body and speech. Despite his advanced age at the time, his extraordinary commitment to rehabilitation, along with the unfailing support of his wife, resulted in an almost miraculous restoration of most functions. In early 2005 they moved to Indianapolis to join their daughter and her family. This allowed Jack to enjoy his last years surrounded by his loving extended family. He thrived until just weeks before the end of his journey. Jack was an inspiration to his wife and children, his extended family, friends and all who knew him. His life story, his insight and wise counsel, his ever present cheer and good humor, touched the lives of countless people. He was the consummate gentleman. He took seriously his obligation to perfect the world (''tikkun olam''), and leaves a legacy of love, honor and social justice. His family now celebrates the conclusion of an extraordinary journey. Services will be held on Wednesday, March 5, 2008 at 1PM at the Aaron - Ruben - Nelson Mortuary, 1328 West 86th Street. Interment will be Friday, March 7, 2008 at 1PM at Beth Israel Memorial Park, Woodbridge, New Jersey. No flowers, please.

The first is of its creator, Jacques Cavallier, a prolific perfumer so successful these days that he often seems to generate a quarter of each year's worldwide fragrance product.

Cavallier, plucked it from the crowd and cast it in starring roles in several of the biggest commercial successes the perfume industry has ever seen. It virtually defined perfume style in the 1990s. Whether Bulgari is making a wise choice in launching an updated 90s scent in 2008 is another question."

During a conference call with reporters, Dan Glickman, the association’s chief executive, said the number of films taking in more than $100 million at the box office expanded sharply. “When people liked us, they really loved us,” Mr. Glickman said. According to the figures, compiled in partnership with Nielsen EDI, the international box office expanded about 4.9 percent to $26.7 billion. That figure was given a boost by the weakness of the dollar against some foreign currencies, including the euro. One of the more startling year-to-year changes was a sharp rise in spending by the studios’ specialty divisions, which make and distribute some films intended for the annual awards races and others aimed at getting fans of horror and other genres. According to the report such divisions’ investment in production rose 6 percent to an average $42.9 million per movie, while marketing costs jumped 44 percent to $25.7 million."

Seven members of the group, which achieved international renown and won a national art prize for its images, are to appear in court on March 25, when they face sentences of as much as three years for scaremongering.

Trademark, market, and public opinion researcher, who applied social science to matters ranging from jury selection to trademark research, died in his Manhattan home at age 84 on Friday, February 22. Dr. Sorensen was a leading figure in the application of survey research to trademark litigation. He designed and administered opinion surveys to measure consumer perceptions, with special focus on public confusion over trademarks and product source. Dr. Sorensen provided expert testimony in over 70 cases in US District Courts, state courts, and proceedings of the Patent and Trademark Office and US International Trade Commission. Robert Chaikin Sorensen was born on September 7, 1923, in Lincoln, Nebraska. He earned his bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. (1954) degrees from the University of Chicago, all in sociology. Between 1952 and 1954, Dr. Sorensen was associated with the Operations Research Office of Johns Hopkins University and worked on psychological warfare efforts for the US Army in Korea. From 1954-1958, Dr. Sorensen was Director of Audience Research and Analysis for Radio Free Europe in Munich, Germany, where he led efforts to measure the effectiveness of broadcasts to five Eastern European countries during charged Cold War years which saw the suppression by Soviet forces of the popular uprising in Hungary. In 1959, Dr. Sorensen settled in New York City, where he worked as Director of Research for This Week Magazine (1959-1961), VP and Corp. Director of Research at D'Arcy Advertising (1961-1966), Executive Director at the Center for Advanced Practice (1966-1968), and VP and Corporate Director of Marketing at Warner Communications (now Time Warner) (1972-1974). In 1968, Dr. Sorensen formed Sorensen Marketing / Management Corporation, where he pioneered the application of public opinion research techniques to trademark infringement and intellectual property issues. From 1981 to 1993, he was a professor of marketing at Rider University. Dr. Sorensen was Chairman of the boards of both Childreach/Plan International (formerly Foster Parents Plan) and the Scandinavian Seminar, as well as VP at the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science, and Board Member at the Center for Advanced Studies of Religion and Science, Primary Stages, Inc. (a theatrical company), Girl Scouts USA, and Scandinavian Seminar College. His publications include a book on adolescent sexuality (1973), a book, Free Will and Determinism (1987, edited with Viggo Mortensen), and numerous professional articles. Dr. Sorensen is survived by his wife of 65 years, Marjorie, and two sons, Robert ''Chris,'' of New City, NY, and David, of Copenhagen, Denmark. A daughter, Katherine, of Dallas, died in 2001. He is also survived by three siblings, Theodore, Philip, and Ruth, as well as four grandchildren, Hannah, Stephen, Nicholas and Axel."

There was nothing timid about those bags. Weighty and capacious, they nudged aside the canvas backpack as a totem of hipster chic. Some were purely practical, large enough to transport documents, spare sneakers or, if need be, the contents of one's medicine chest. Others conveyed heaps of status. Wise to the power of a high-fashion label, Marcin Tyszka (bottom row, center) carried an envelope clutch by Louis Vuitton.

Instead, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's victories in Ohio, Texas and Rhode Island -- and the slowing of Senator Barack Obama's momentum -- left the political waters as murky as ever. And some of the undecided superdelegates are as flummoxed as ever. One, Muriel K. Offerman, said Wednesday that she had been hoping the decision would have been made for her. Instead, she said she was still weighing both candidates. Complicating the matter for Ms. Offerman, a Democratic National Committee member since 1989, is that her state, North Carolina, has not voted yet."

M. Allen. Then again, as these tents start at $15,000 (the one at above right, at $17,000), without any furniture, it might be better to send the guests to a hotel. Still, there is a lot of tent for the money. The basic models range from 10 by 15 feet to 15 by 30, and because they are all custom made, the size and design can be tweaked. They also have that evocative and romantic mesh-flap front door -- and the romance of a link to the Africa of Hemingway, Ava Gardner and the great safari hunters. Sort of."

Mr. Rakowitz, also of the East Village, was charged in 1989 with killing his girlfriend and dismembering her. Accounts of what happened have varied over the years as Mr. Rakowitz’s story has changed, but one account, which he has denied, had him boiling the victim’s body into soup that he served to the homeless."
2008-03-07T12:09:55Z,"Can a black police officer be racist against black people? And how does that play out in the moments before a gun confrontation with another black man? Those questions were explored in a one-act play, “In That Moment,” and the subsequent panel discussion at John Jay College of Criminal Justice on Thursday night.How race plays out in policing (both for the officers and the public) is a theme in the play, but has so far been a subtler issue in the trial before a judge of the three detectives charged in the shooting of Sean Bell, a black man who was killed in the early morning of his wedding day in November 2006."

Karnes, a California lawyer, sent letters late last month to members of Congress with a picture taken of a man standing in front of the Times Square recruiting station, he could not have imagined that days later, F.B.I. agents would swarm his Los Angeles home and interrogate him. The authorities have ruled out a connection between the bombing of the recruiting station on early Thursday morning and Mr. Karnes, who has become an odd footnote to a story that has perplexed investigators."

2008-03-07T00:00:00Z,"Cannotrustclinton.com? clintonisbad.com? At least 25 domain names related to Hillary Rodham Clinton have links to the Republican National Committee: the names were either registered by the R.N.C. last year or showed up on servers the committee uses. Half a dozen seemed to guess at Mrs. Clinton's eventual running mate, like clintonomalley.com, referring to Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland. The day after Barack Obama won the Iowa caucuses, the R.N.C. snapped up at least 20 domains related to his candidacy. Some of them may signal the party's future strategy: baracknotready.com and norealexperience.com. The party has also begun preemptively registering domains that could be used to attack John McCain, like mccainamigos.com, voteagainstmccain.com, flipflopmccain.com and hatemccain.com (ihatemccain.com was taken.) The Democratic Party and the campaigns have shown little of the verve and creativity of the R.N.C. The Obama campaign registered desperatehillaryattacks.com in December. The Clinton campaign registered votingpresent.com two days later, an apparent reference to Mr. Obama's votes as a member of the Illinois legislature. The party has been focused more on the national convention, registering variations of denverdemconvention08.com in February, but so far apparently no domains related to Mr. McCain. The election has ''triggered an avalanche of cybersquatter activity,'' according to NetNames, a domain name management service. Speculators have registered nearly 2,000 domain names related to presidential candidates as of last week. Names related to Mrs. Clinton's candidacy made up over half of the registrations, followed by Mr. Obama with 635 and Mr. McCain with 269.

Based in San Diego, Ms. Lowe has specialized in constructing satiric museum-style period rooms out of papier-mâché and enamel paint. For this show she has created a library of invented titles and displayed them on bookshelves covered with wood-grain-patterned paper, right. Also made of papier-mâché and colorfully painted with a skillful, loose touch, the books imitate various genres, including self-help, children's storybooks, academic tomes, law books and popular potboilers.

Mr. Haeg is the creator of Edible Estates, which aims to persuade homeowners to grow not grass but fruit, vegetables and nuts in their yards. The campaign began in 2005 with a commission from the Salina Art Center in Salina, Kan., the geographical center of the United States, where Mr. Haeg helped plant a mini-grove in the yard of a local couple. He was attracted to the area, he said, as a way to take a break from the ''cultural ghettos'' of New York and Los Angeles, where he had lived. More gardens were sown in New Jersey, California (above, his ''Edible Estates Regional Prototype Garden No. 2: Lakewood, Calif., 2006'') and London; Baltimore and Austin, Tex., are next.

The event will feature the works of students and recent graduates from the departments of music, theater and visual arts, which together form the College of Fine Arts.

Take a scene from ''Seven Chances,'' which Keaton, above, directed and stars in as Jimmy Shannon, a hapless romantic who must marry by 7 p.m. if he wants to collect a $7 million inheritance. Jimmy -- neatly turned out in a morning suit -- dozes on a church pew unaware of the army of brides behind him: dream of salvation or nightmare?

2008-03-07T00:00:00Z,"It's good to know that even the culturally elevated have their lowbrow moments. The choreographer and director Liam Steel was reaching for an Agatha Christie novel to ease the pain of a bad breakup when a copy of R. D. Laing's ''Knots'' fell off the shelf. (Clearly lowbrow has no chance in certain contexts.) The eventual outcome was a new work -- also called ''Knots'' -- made for the CoisCeim Dance Theater from Ireland and being performed this weekend as part of the Peak Performances series at Montclair State University in New Jersey. The writings of Mr. Laing, a Scottish psychiatrist and psychoanalyst best known for his unorthodox views on psychosis, might seem an unlikely inspiration for a dance piece. But Mr. Steel immediately recognized parallels between Mr. Laing's work and his own. ''He was looking at relationships and condensing them down into poetry,'' said Mr. Steel, who danced with DV8 Physical Theater for eight years before working as a freelance theater director and choreographer and forming his own company, Stan Won't Dance, in 2004. ''It's about individuals being very different while the themes, our behaviors, are universal.''"

With a wonderful smile and a twinkle, he could take on complex issues, ask key questions, and develop powerful new approaches. The Department of Psychiatry of New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center was one of the many beneficiaries of his compassion and capacities. He appreciated the value of research and academic training, and recognized the importance of psychiatry's future advances. Through his efforts, the legendary philanthropist DeWitt Wallace, the founder of Reader's Digest, agreed to facilitate and sustain our Department's work in these vital areas. The result was a gift of an endowment from the DeWitt Wallace Fund, thoughtfully administered through The New York Community Trust, to support the Department's programs. The endowment, and the significant funds provided over the past decades, constitute one of the great gifts in the history of American psychiatry, and will have a significant impact in perpetuity.

This being a testosterone-fueled domain, the most tender looks are exchanged between Nicholas Angel (Mr. Pegg) and his sidekick, Danny Butterman (Nick Frost, above left with Mr. Pegg). ''It's a world in which boys will be boys at every available opportunity,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''For the most part these are fine boys indeed,'' she said of the cast, which also includes Jim Broadbent, Paddy Considine and Timothy Dalton, adding that ''the emotional intimacy of Mr. Pegg and Mr. Frost's on-screen relationship suggests that there's more to these performers than parody.'' 8 P.M.

2008-03-09T00:00:00Z,"Old-fashioned seems an odd way to describe the three hip-looking best friends behind Lova, a new men’s-wear label out of Los Angeles. While they definitely have the looks to make the fashion scene out there, Giuseppe Valentini, Nikolas Apostolopoulos and Daniel Murphy (above) have little interest in hanging out with Lindsay or Paris. In fact, they are as inclined to trawl the farmers’ markets as the bars, so they can serve up elaborate Greek dinners and anecdotes about their grandmothers in the three-bedroom duplex they share. The trio’s quaint sensibilities translate into pinstriped blazers, short-sleeved cashmere cardigans and narrow-collared shirts with buttons made of corozo nut. Rather than staging a runway show to showcase their line, the guys made a short film, which has the look of a Super 8 home movie taken at a sunny backyard barbecue — albeit one where all the guests are impeccably dressed bright young things. “Rather than just show the clothes, we wanted to evoke an emotion,” Murphy says. That emotion is suffused with hazy nostalgia, much like the collection’s creators. [?][?][?]JEN WANG."

2008-03-09T00:00:00Z,"Elvis Presley, with his assortment of bedazzled jumpsuits, may be the king of one-piece dressing, but thankfully he wasn’t the inspiration for this season’s styles. Designers like Miuccia Prada and Alexander McQueen were more interested in the functional garments first worn by workers and pilots; Dsquared went for pit stop mechanics; and Calvin Klein’s futuristic versions brought to mind “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Levi Strauss introduced denim “Koveralls” for children in 1912; Lee followed the next year with its Union-All suit, intended for farmers and factory workers. World War I pilots wore flight suits based on Lee’s adaptable model, and avant-garde artists zipped up after the war: the Constructivist artist Alexander Rodchenko had a two-piece “productivist” outfit designed to look like a jumpsuit. In the 1940s, cartoonists added fantasy to the onesie, outfitting the Flash and Green Lantern. But it took man walking on the moon to usher in the “golden age” of the jumpsuit — the 1970s. Soon, entertainers kicked it up a notch: David Bowie as Ziggy Stardust wore outrageous versions; Evel Knievel was sometimes carried into the emergency room in a star-studded red, white and blue leather number. Devo performed in yellow jumpsuits. And in the early 1980s, retro-futurist designers like Thierry Mugler introduced styles with padded shoulders. Oddly, it was President Bush who refocused the public’s attention on the flight suit when he modeled one in front of the infamous “Mission Accomplished” banner in 2003. And let’s not forget shackled terrorists and their orange prison suits. The latter can be had for $13.95 at nationaltextile.us.

Ah, the glory days. The Samurai Sibling was just a big sissy pants till puberty, when he grew stronger and hairier and finally landed a monster uppercut on my jaw. We called it even. But Sipper’s superiority continues unchallenged in nonpugilistic matters, and if the Sib mutters “age before beauty” within earshot, I go below the belt and over his head with two words: Viagra and Rogaine."

The female champion Suzanne Lenglen was playing in long outfits by Chanel and Patou; it wasn’t uncommon for her male counterparts to duke it out in belted slacks, dress shirts and leather lace-ups. On occasion, espadrilles (a sartorial leftover from the Basque game of pelota) would lend a welcome — if sometimes ankle-wrenching — sense of ease to the proceedings."

2008-03-09T00:00:00Z,"I started wearing pajamas during the day shortly after I founded Playboy in 1953. It made sense because the first few issues were put together in my apartment, where I would often work straight through the night. In the early ’60s, when I moved into the Playboy Mansion in Chicago, I stopped going to the office altogether; by the ’80s, I had begun using pajamas in a more social way. When I had friends over for a buffet and a movie on Friday nights, I didn’t bother to put on a shirt or a suit, and people started to be disappointed if I didn’t wear PJ’s. I think I have about 100 different pairs in silk custom-made for me by a tailor named Mr. Brown. During the day I wear black; for weekends I prefer purple; and on holidays and special occasions, red. My bedsheets are black satin, and my girlfriends like to wear pink pajamas. Holly stays with me overnight, and my other two girlfriends, Kendra and Bridget, have their own bedrooms. It would be crazy if we all tried to sleep together, because Holly has four dogs that stay in our bed, Bridget has a dog and a cat, and Kendra has two dogs. But we like to throw pajama parties to give our guests the opportunity to dress the way I do. It’s very comfortable, and if you can pull it off, there’s definitely a certain style to it."

2008-03-09T00:00:00Z,"Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana are cracking wise. The pair are holding court during Milan Fashion Week and appear surprisingly relaxed, given that the last few days have been one long Dolceandgabbanarama, including a V.I.P. dinner to celebrate a calendar featuring their new underwear model, David Gandy. “Did you see Silvio Berlusconi at the dinner?” asks Dolce, referring to the former Italian prime minister, who at one point during the night was cornered by a fashion-world gender illusionist who’s had more work done than Zsa Zsa. Says Gabbana, “I think Berlusconi thought it was Liza Minnelli.” Since Dolce and Gabbana are inexorably linked to a pantheon of cinema and sporting gods, they can afford to joke about the important business of dressing one of Italy’s reigning heartthrobs: Riccardo Scamarcio, the 28-year-old star of “My Brother Is an Only Child,” coming out this month. “Riccardo who?” Gabbana asks. “Seriously, he is becoming like Brad Pitt in Italy.” The clothes that the designers have chosen may require that Scamarcio do some advanced role playing. Which is perfectly O.K. with him."

2008-03-09T00:00:00Z,"Stanley Kirk Burrell, also known as MC Hammer, has had his fair share of lives. He started out as a batboy, became a rap superstar, was born again as a preacher and is now a Web entrepreneur promoting his site, DanceJam.com. Needless to say, that doesn’t include his sideline as a fashion icon. Did you know that Hammer pants are back? Labels like Dior (left) and Burberry have been doing really baggy trousers. Yes. To have invented the Hammer pants and have them re-emerge with a twist is an honor. When and how did you start wearing them? In the late ’70s, during the disco era, when we were going out to the clubs. The looser the pants, the more accentuated your dancing becomes. Initially I would buy triple-pleated zoot-suit trousers from the ’40s; when I became MC Hammer, I started having my own versions made. Did you wear Hammer pants later on, when you were a pastor officiating at the weddings of people like Corey Feldman and Mötley Crüe’s Vince Neil? I use Hammer pants to perform. For day-to-day life, I have 30 suits that I rotate. I’ve always been a high-fashion dresser and love the bespoke style. Once, I bought 80 suits from Versace in all the colors of the rainbow — as bright as canary yellow. To accessorize I had special-edition Versace watches and Rolexes customized with rubies and baguettes. And then came the earrings. Have you ever considered fashion design? Part of my vision is to have a clothing line with a great strategic partner. Not just upper-end, but scaled back to a great pair of Hammer-style jeans — baggy, but not the baggy kind that kids are wearing falling off the butt. I mean baggy Hammer in the crotch area — big difference. Maybe you should call some of the designers that are doing Hammer pants now and ask to be in their ad campaigns. I think you should suggest it, and I’d certainly be interested. [?][?][?]ARMAND LIMNANDE."

The rock musician Tadayuki Inui organizes Minnade Nako Kai in Kyoto; the film buff and restaurateur Kosuke Kimura in Sendai owns Ruisen Kai (the Lachrymal Gland Club in English). England’s stiff upper lip is also quivering. The artist Viktor Wynd holds teary events called Loss: An Evening of Exquisite Misery (below), inspired by Günter Grass’s sad nightclub, the Onion Cellar, in “The Tin Drum.” Gloomy guests swoon around in vintage clothes, listen to fado music and carry peacock feathers, half-dead flowers salvaged from cemeteries or freshly signed divorce papers. Come midnight, attendees are handed knives and onions to chop to the sound of the Mozart Requiem. Overly chirpy attendees are fined one pound per smile and two pounds per laugh. “Melancholia is not such a bad thing,” says Wynd, who is hoping to bring his mournful bashes to New York soon. “I don’t know why people think they’re supposed to be happy all the time.”[?][?][?] MARK ELLWOOD."

Palmer Baker Jr. was a major force in the creation of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in 1971. The Ludwig Institute from its inception was designed to establish and integrate laboratory and clinical cancer research activities spanning the globe. Mr. Baker was a vital and long standing member of the Institute's Board of Directors and served as Chairman of the Board from 1995-2005, guiding the Institute as it continued to emerge into the world's largest international not-for-profit cancer research enterprise. Mr. Baker was also a Trustee of the Virginia and D.K. Ludwig Fund for Cancer Research, which, in 2006, made the largest single donation by a foundation to cancer research in the United States, establishing research centers at Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Chicago and Stanford University. He was deeply admired by the entire Ludwig community for his contributions to the world of cancer research The generosity of spirit and high standards that Mr. Baker brought to all of his endeavors will be sorely missed.

(Like him, I also source and sell vintage clothing.) Denim and work wear have since become the stock in trade of his company, Carpe Denim, which specializes in beat-up work trousers, pre-20th-century denim, hunting jackets, boots, uniforms, athletic bags and farming sacks.

Edward Levin, of Cambridge, New York, and Cedar Key, Florida, died February 23, 2008, at his home in Cedar Key, early in the morning, at age 87. Ed was born February 4, 1921 in New York City and grew up in Long Beach on Long Island. He was an artist, craftsperson, jeweler, painter, sculptor, ceramist, and inventor of machines, tools and processes to enhance creativity in jewelry-making. In 1950 Ed and his wife, Ruth Levin, founded Ed Levin Jewelry. Ed studied fine arts at Columbia University, and later at Alfred University, the New School, and the Barnes Foundation. He successfully obtained conscientious objector status during World War II. In 1948 Ed lived for the year in Buenos Aires, Argentina and studied with a Florentine master jeweler. In 1949 Ed married Ruth Perlmutter, and lived on the Upper West Side in New York City. In 1950 with his wife, he founded Ed Levin Jewelry and made jewelry on the stove top in their New York apartment. He traveled by bus throughout New England to sell his jewelry to college students. In 1953 they moved to Shaftsbury, Vermont, where Ed sold his artwork and jewelry from Ed Levin Arts Workshop, established in a building on their property. In 1964, he moved his workshop to Bennington where he opened a retail shop. In 1968, Ed married Ruth Pearl Bluestone Dale, bought a house in Cambridge, New York, and moved his wholesale business to Cambridge, as well. While Ed continued to design jewelry he also spent time in his studio at home painting, sculpting, throwing pots, and inventing tools. Ed Levin Jewelry, Inc., considered the oldest and largest hand-crafted jewelry manufacturer in the United States, is owned by the family and currently sells to hundreds of retail shops throughout the country. Ed was adamant in his beliefs and followed his own path. Life, for him, was a continuing exploration of ideas, the senses, and challenging the status quo. He actively supported peace, human rights, civil liberties, and environmental protection. Ed said, The diversity and richness of the natural world and all of the peoples who have inhabited it will always inspire both art and jewelry. The connections are not necessarily direct or obvious...Nevertheless, our present is still connected to the earth forms and ancestor creations that abound and still touch us. Ed was predeceased by his second wife, Ruth Dale Levin, and his brother, Ernest Levin. He leaves his first wife, Ruth Perlmutter Levin, his three children, Rachel Levin, Flo Levin, and Alexander Levin; and two stepsons, Paul Bluestone and Donald Bluestone. Ed will be buried in Cambridge, New York, in the spring. Contributions in Eds memory may be sent to: Allen Gilbert, ACLU Vermont, 137 Elm Street, Montpelier, VT 05602."

2008-03-09T00:00:00Z,"THE WILD SIDE Until a few years ago, I tended to think of fossils as bones and shells -- the vestiges of animal skeletons. But all sorts of other things can leave fossils, too. Footprints are one. Feces, another. Impressions of skin and feathers. Leaves and pollen. Growth rings of trees. All of these open different windows onto the past; together, they help us construct a richer portrait of it than we could glean from skeletons by themselves. Widths of tree rings indicate rainfall, and thus, climate. Fossil leaves can show damage from the maraudings of ancient insects; analysis of leaf damage can thus illuminate the broader dynamics of ecosystems. Fossil feces (coprolites) reveal extinct diets; they can also reveal attributes of plants where actual plant fossils are missing."

2008-03-09T00:00:00Z,"SEATED within the white cube, silent and stylish, a look of ennui fixed on their faces, gallery assistants are a curious breed. You notice them; they don't really notice you. They are, in a way, part of the show. ''They play into the psychology of the gallery as this immaculate, encapsulated space,'' said the artist Brina Thurston. Her show, ''Dark Pump,'' which opens this week at Rivington Arms, brings the elusive gallery assistant into sharp focus. On opening night, seven of them, from galleries around the city (''Julie'' and ''Diane,'' above), will be stationed behind white desks. Ms. Thurston has asked them to dress as they would for an opening (''It's usually artfully assembled vintage,'' she explained. ''The job pays little.'') and do what they would at work (''mostly mailings''). Afterward, life-size cutouts will sit in their places, perpetuating the idea of the gallery assistant as a kind of art form."

2008-03-09T00:00:00Z,"ZELTER--Mary Gill, ''Cappy,'' a retired registered nurse and travel agent, and beloved mother of four children and 12 grandchildren, passed away on February 26, 2008. She was 86. Mary Ruth Gill was born in Tulsa, OK, on August 14, 1921. Like many during the Depression era, her family moved frequently as her father sought employment. When her mother died of pneumonia at age 39, Mrs. Zelter moved to Elmira, NY, to live with her maternal grandparents. After high school she went on to the Highland Hospital School of Nursing, where she earned certification as a Registered Nurse. She continued on to earn a Bachelor's degree in Nursing from the University of Rochester. Through the 1940s she served in a range of nursing and administrative capacities at Highland Hospital, and all her children were born at that same hospital, dear to her heart. On January 4, 1949, she married Charles Theodore Zelter of Rochester, NY, with whom she had four children and a full, active life. Mr. and Mrs. Zelter claimed as a fifth child the son of Mrs. Zelter's sister, Jane Gill Feagan, after she and her husband Kenneth Feagan passed away over two decades ago. She also was a warm and much-loved hostess, frequently entertaining at home and enjoying a vivid social life with a wide circle of friends. The children remember that at their Thanksgiving dinners, their parents regularly included others without local family of their own. She could be trusted to carry a jar of soup or a meal to a friend in need. Mr. and Mrs. Zelter lived in Rochester for over twenty years then moved to Pittsford, NY, at which time Mary became employed with the American Auto Association as a travel agent. Mrs. Zelter was herself an avid traveler, and took great delight in showing people the beauties of the world. Throughout her 50s and 60s, she could be found enthusiastically leading groups through areas as various as the Canadian Rockies and Egypt. Soon after Charles Zelter retired from the B. Forman Company in 1980, he and Mrs. Zelter began spending winters in Venice, Florida. The couple moved to Venice full time in 1995. Charles Zelter died in 2006, and Mary Zelter moved to Regal Palms, an assisted living facility in Largo, in the fall of 2007. Mary Zelter is survived by her four children, Barbara Zelter of Raleigh, North Carolina; Christine Berry of Faversham, England; Mary Frances (and Phil) Lallucci of Belleair, FL; James Zelter (and Vivian) of New York City; nephew Michael Caudell-Feagan (and Linda) of Arlington, VA; and 12 grandchildren, one of whom currently serves with the U.S. Navy in Iraq. A memorial mass in her honor will be private. Those wishing to offer donations may contribute to: The Highland Hospital Foundation in memory of Mary G. Zelter, at 1000 South Avenue, Box 40, Rochester, NY 14620."

The Officers and Associates of The CM & F Group, Cotterell, Mitchell and Fifer, mourn the premature passing of our friend, supporter, colleague, and fellow officer Josephine O'Connor on 6 March. Josephine comported an aura of professionalism and confidence only surpassed by the reality of her high standards and remarkable competence. Her charm, grace and welcoming smile benefitted us all. Josephine's more than quarter century with The Firm was marked with contunal growth and enhanced contributions of her skills and support to the betterment of our clients, friends and collaborators. The sudden loss of her beloved Tom, her educator and umpire, dulled the edge of her joy but inspired her to greater service to CMF, and deepened affection and admiration for her daughters Chris and Cathy, their husbands and cherished children. Her enthusiastic devotion to them, including the late Dusty, was amply shown in the office by her family stories, pictures and pride. The loss of Josephine's special talents and the smiling support is great and deeply felt. Happily, the memory of her graceful and sincere support for us, her friendship and loyalty, the contentment of being so long together at William and Hudson Streets, will soften the hardness of our loss. The Firm extends its deepest sympathy to Jo's family, and all who, like us, loved her. For The Firm Richard J. J. Sullivan, Jr., President and CEO"

She is survived by her husband, four children Lizzie, Harry, Rufus and Jerry; Jerrys wife, Amy; and seven grandchildren Eruch, Elizabeth, Rufus, Daniel, Anna, Rose and Georgiana. A talented artist in many mediums, Wiz sketched and painted scenes remembered from her travels and experiences. A favorite subject was Cobble Hill Farm in Kent, CT where her beloved mother moved the family in 1941. In 1973, Wiz and Casie bought land in Webster, NH and built, with Casies help and that of their sons, the house Wiz designed, creating a place she had described in an early poem ''where flowers embroider forgotten lanes under suns and moons and quiet rains.'' Wiz recently donated 55 acres of that land to the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests to form ''The little brook Sanctuary'', extending in perpetuity a natural refuge for the animals and natural settings she loved.

Composed under a commission from the BBC program &#8220;Inside Out West,&#8221; the five-section work explores different stages of Mr. Patch&#8217;s life, the BBC reported. Prince Charles described Mr. Patch as epitomizing &#8220;the courage, long-sufferingness and tenacity of his generation.&#8221; The poem moves from its subject&#8217;s childhood home to the battlefields of the Western Front, where he was wounded and, in its final act, to a nursing home in Wells, England, where he lives. Mr. Motion said of the poem, &#8220;It is by some distance the most interesting of these sorts of commissions that I&#8217;ve done.&#8221; Last month Mr. Patch attended a special event to hear the poem recited for the first time. He told Mr. Motion: &#8220;It&#8217;s a great honor to have a poem written for me by you. That&#8217;s all I can say.&#8221;."
2008-03-10T00:00:00Z,"Vulcan, a small Canadian prairie town, is bidding to be the host of the world premiere of the next “Star Trek” movie, Agence France-Presse reported. Situated among the oil wells, wheat fields and cow pastures of Alberta, the community is already home to a three-day annual “Star Trek” convention. Dayna Dickens, a spokeswoman for Vulcan, said: “Because the film’s story line is based on a young Mr. Spock and a young Captain Kirk in their early days at Starfleet and because we think of Mr. Spock as our native son, it would be a neat tie-in to bring Spock home for the movie launch. I mean, Vulcan is his birthplace.” Actually, a surveyor named the railroad stop in 1910 for Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. Ms. Dickens said the town had sent a proposal in September to the executive producers of the film, tentatively titled “Star Trek Zero,” and was told last month they were considering it, she said. Ms. Dickens noted that Vulcan has “logistical issues,” including no movie theater. But she said, noting that movies are regularly screened in the school gymnasium, “we can work around them.”."
2008-03-10T00:00:00Z,"Curators at Britain&#8217;s National Portrait Gallery, researching an exhibition that is to open on Thursday, rediscovered a painting of an 18th-century female scholar who was a member of the Bluestocking group of intellectuals who promoted the advancement of women, the BBC reported. The oil portrait, above, regarded as a major work, was created between 1735 and 1741 by John Fayram and depicts Elizabeth Carter as Minerva, goddess of wisdom and warfare. Carter was known for her translation of the Stoic philosopher Epictetus, but her friend Samuel Johnson said that besides her talent for translation, she could also make a pudding, work a handkerchief and compose a poem. The curators knew of the existence of the painting from a poem published in 1741 and a photograph sent to the gallery in the 1940s and found it in a private collection. Never previously on public display, it will be seen in &#8220;Brilliant Women: 18th-Century Bluestockings,&#8221; running until June 15."

The newspaper said Chinese print and electronic news media were told on Friday &#8220;to immediately remove&#8221; any works and commercials featuring Ms. Tang, but it was not clear how long the ban would continue. The newspaper report, citing unnamed sources, said &#8220;Lust, Caution&#8221; was regarded as &#8220;beautifying&#8221; those who collaborated with Japan. In the film, Ms. Tang portrays a member of the Chinese resistance who is assigned to assassinate a collaborator, but she changes her mind at the last minute. In December, her performance won her honors as best new performer in Taiwan&#8217;s Golden Horse Awards, considered the Chinese-language Oscars. The report said that Mr. Lee, born in Taiwan and the winner of an Academy Award for his direction of &#8220;Brokeback Mountain&#8221; (2005), was not blacklisted; he is an artistic adviser to the summer Olympics this year in Beijing."

Few of the 92 who lost their jobs and survived the war were reinstated. The exhibition is part of a national commemoration of Austria’s willing acceptance of annexation by Hitler’s Germany, whose forces took control on March 12, 1938. “The Opera is one of the institutions ready to face up to its past even if it was painful at times,” the Austrian chancellor, Alfred Gusenbauer, said in opening the exhibition. “Such institutions in Austria in 2008 are sadly still the exception.” The anniversary has prompted a wave of reflection, with special television programs and an appeal by the Roman Catholic Church to learn the lessons of the past. A candlelight vigil will take place on Wednesday, the anniversary, at the city’s Heldenplatz (Heroes’ Square), where jubilant Austrians gathered to greet Hitler days after the annexation, and both houses of Parliament will hold a special joint session on Wednesday morning to mark the anniversary."
2008-03-11T00:00:00Z,"The British government is trying to prevent a former MI5 member from publishing a book on the inner workings of the secret service, The Daily Telegraph in London reported. The 300-page manuscript is said to reveal some successes, failures and recruiting techniques of the covert organization. The author reportedly penetrated the Irish Republican Army and organized gangs and recruited agents to infiltrate jihadist groups plotting terror attacks in Britain. Legal proceedings, to be held in secret, are expected to begin at the High Court in London this week before a senior judge, who will rule on whether publication would breach national security. The controversy is reminiscent of the “Spycatcher” scandal of 1987, when the government unsuccessfully tried to prevent Peter Wright, another former MI5 officer, from publishing details of his work to uncover a traitor within the security service. Attempts to ban “Spycatcher” failed, and the book went on to sell more than two million copies."

2008-03-11T00:00:00Z,"MIDWEST MINNESOTA: AL FRANKEN RIVAL STEPS ASIDE Mike Ciresi, a well-known lawyer and Democrat, announced that he was dropping his bid for a United States Senate seat. The departure leaves Al Franken, the former comedian, in a smaller field of Democrats, including Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer, a professor, seeking the endorsement of the state party at its convention in June. Mr. Ciresi had been viewed by some as Mr. Franken's chief Democratic rival. The Democratic nominee will most likely face Senator Norm Coleman, a Republican, in November. ''In my judgment, continuing the endorsement race would only lead to an unnecessary floor fight,'' Mr. Ciresi said in a written statement. ''It is time to step aside.'' MONICA DAVEY"

2008-03-12T00:00:00Z,"Fox News Channel, tinkering for the first time in eight years with its popular early evening lineup, is replacing its 5 p.m. news broadcast, &#8220;The Big Story,&#8221; with an election-theme program for the foreseeable future. The network confirmed this week that &#8220;America&#8217;s Election HQ,&#8221; a program that displaced &#8220;The Big Story&#8221; temporarily last month, would continue indefinitely. The program&#8217;s hosts, Bill Hemmer and Megyn Kelly, also anchor the network&#8217;s mid-morning newscast and are seen as rising stars on the channel. The change was first reported by the blog TVNewser.com. John Gibson, the longtime host of &#8220;The Big Story,&#8221; will continue to have a role on television, the network said, although it appears that his future for now lies mostly on radio. For two years Mr. Gibson, a conservative commentator, has been the host of a three-hour program for Fox News Radio immediately following his television show. Fox News Channel, the top-rated cable news network, has benefited in recent years from a stable programming schedule, while CNN and MSNBC have made multiple on-camera changes. The programming shift underscores the emphasis placed on election-year programming by the cable news networks."

Julianna Margulies, the show&#8217;s star, said the network wanted to &#8220;bring a little FX to Fox.&#8221; But young viewers showed little interest in &#8220;Canterbury&#8217;s Law,&#8221; as the show&#8217;s premiere finished in fourth place in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic at 8 p.m. on Monday, Nielsen reported. Fox suggested that the transition to daylight saving time might have had some impact on the ratings. &#8220;Canterbury&#8217;s Law&#8221; averaged 7.6 million viewers, enough to place second in total viewers behind ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Bachelor,&#8221; but delivered a disappointing 1.7 rating in the 18-to-49 demographic favored by advertisers. At 9 p.m. &#8220;New Amsterdam&#8221; picked up some viewers for Fox, averaging 8.8 million viewers and a 2.5 rating in that demographic. The 11.7 million viewers for &#8220;Two and a Half Men&#8221; and the 10.1 million viewers for &#8220;CSI: Miami&#8221; put CBS into first place for the night.

Such funds shall not be converted by any person to a personal use which is unrelated to a political campaign or the holding of a public office or party position.”

To simply refer generically to these strategists as ""consultants,"" however, as if they were necessarily experts in the same craft, is to obscure important differences in how they got to where they are-differences that can often be important to understanding the arc of a particular campaign. This long and remarkable struggle between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama has been a study not just in the brilliance and the blind spots of the candidates themselves, but also those of their most trusted - and highly paid - advisers. Mr. Axelrod is an ad guy. A man who perfected the craft of encapsulating an entire life in 30 seconds, he has a gift for telling personal stories in ways that people can understand. As my colleague Benjamin Wallace Wells wrote in a Times Magazine profile last year, Mr. Axelrod's essential insight - the idea that has made him successful where others might have failed - is that the modern campaign really isn't about the policy arcana or the candidate's record; it's about a more visceral, more personal narrative. This is probably a big reason why Mr. Obama has, from the start, focused almost exclusively on broad themes of ""hope"" and ""change,"" drawing heavily on his own life story, rather than staking out any particularly new policy ground. In its tone and emphasis, Mr. Obama's campaign reflects all the attributes of a truly great political ad: the stirring words, the beautiful pictures, the simple and elegant storyline of a ruined political system and the man whose moment has arrived."

2008-03-13T09:36:32Z,"Philosophers like to debate the ""trolley problem,"" in which they try to decide if it's ethical to kill one innocent man to save five others from a runaway streetcar. That's fun and games for philosophers, but here's a problem from the real world. Following the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 in which 800,000 people were murdered in 100 days, the victimized Tutsis rose up and chased the killers, along with 2 million of their Hutu tribesmen, out of the country. Now the Hutus were camped along the border, and dying by the thousands each day from starvation and disease. You are the United Nations representative charged with assisting these desperate refugees. But the individuals who control the camps are the very people who committed the genocide, and since any relief you provide has to flow through them, your help necessarily increases their authority. What's more, they are hoping to return to their country and complete the genocidal work they began. Other humanitarian agencies are unwilling to aid the Hutus, even though it means that tens of thousands more may die, so you are their only hope. What do you do?"

2008-03-13T08:08:11Z,"The ""oriental"" category of perfumes is basically defined as scents built on two materials, vanilla and labdanum. Vanilla is slightly problematic; the 1960s turned it into a sort of hippie cliché. Then there's labdanum, a natural resin from a Mediterranean bush that smells quite strongly like a dock worker's armpit. Shalimar, created in 1925 by the perfumer Jacques Guerlain, is historically one of the most important perfumes ever made as it is arguably the progenitor of the entire category of parfums gourmands (culinary perfumes). But Shalimar is also a true oriental, which means vanilla plus labdanum, and that in turn means that Guerlain faces the challenge of selling this great early 20th-century work of art in the 21st-century global marketplace."

Each drawer is slightly taller in back, so it catches on the piece above, holding it in place; the back of the table attaches to a screw drilled into the wall. Shay Alkalay, the product designer who created the table with Yael Mer, his partner at Raw-Edges Design Studio in London, said he envisions it in an entrance hall. “You put in your eyeglasses and your mobile phone and your keys,” he said, “and in the morning, when you’re really rushed,” you can save time by opening both drawers at once. Pivot is 40 inches high and 31 inches wide, and comes in various shades of lacquered oak ($2,200) and in natural walnut ($2,350), at M2L, 215 East 58th Street, (212) 832-8222. ELAINE LOUIE."

We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Helane, his children, Laurel, Heather, Sean, Mikaela, and his entire family. Dr. Colvin supremely exemplified three highly commendable traits. He was: A devoted husband and a fanatically loving father; A brilliant theoretical, tactical and technical cardiac surgeon; A friend of incomparable magnitude, loyalty and generosity. He was an indefatigable flame who illuminated with his visionary approaches to minimally invasive cardiac surgery and pioneered techniques that saved thousands of lives. He educated and trained a generation of cardiac surgeons who disseminated Dr. Colvin's methods throughout all parts of the United States and many corners of the world. He was a maverick who was never complacent, never accepted mediocrity and made it his credo to always question. Accepted techniques were dissected under the microscope and discarded when alternative methods to performing surgery more efficiently and with better results were discovered. The beneficiary was always the patient. There was no greater joy in his life than sharing his discoveries with others. He was a motivator who could persuade, but could also be persuaded if the scientific facts proved otherwise. He was an inspiration to all those around him. The magnitude of our loss is immeasurable.

While the invitation (above) decreed a dress code of ""black tie e maschera,"" the uptown crowd's willingness to mask themselves varied. Over the course of the evening we witnessed all types - from The Classicist (in a Venetian-style eye mask con handle) to The Sex Kitten (a ribbon of fancy black lace tied over the eyes), from The Psycho (a terrifying translucent iteration of the ""Eyes Wide Shut"" mask) to The Jolly Enthusiast (a woman in a Vegas-style eye mask, a rhapsody in blue feathers).

I convulse at the mere scent of banana and nothing embodies hell on earth for me quite like the texture of rice pudding. For better or worse, I was raised in a home where chicken was the norm and exotic dishes were discreetly fed to the dog as quickly as they were placed on the table. (I'm remembering one instance in particular involving a rice-and-beef-stuffed pumpkin so vile even Sparky wouldn't eat it.) As far as I can tell, I am the typical, boring American eater; I like cheesy, crispy, fatty, salty or sweet food made with ingredients I can pronounce. I crave preservatives and chemically enhanced juices; I crave red-white-and-blue-dyed snack cakes filled with liquefied marshmallow substitute. High fructose corn syrup figuratively - and probably literally - courses through my veins. So you can imagine my growing distress at America's growing palette."

We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Helane, his children, Laurel, Heather, Sean, Mikaela, and his entire family. Dr. Colvin supremely exemplified three highly commendable traits. He was: A devoted husband and a fanatically loving father; A brilliant theoretical, tactical and technical cardiac surgeon; A friend of incomparable magnitude, loyalty and generosity. He was an indefatigable flame who illuminated with his visionary approaches to minimally invasive cardiac surgery and pioneered techniques that saved thousands of lives. He educated and trained a generation of cardiac surgeons who disseminated Dr. Colvin's methods throughout all parts of the United States and many corners of the world. He was a maverick who was never complacent, never accepted mediocrity and made it his credo to always question. Accepted techniques were dissected under the microscope and discarded when alternative methods to performing surgery more efficiently and with better results were discovered. The beneficiary was always the patient. There was no greater joy in his life than sharing his discoveries with others. He was a motivator who could persuade, but could also be persuaded if the scientific facts proved otherwise. He was an inspiration to all those around him. The magnitude of our loss is immeasurable.

2008-03-14T00:00:00Z,"THOROLD DICKINSON'S WORLD OF CINEMA Here's a fine opportunity to go spelunking in the perennially underestimated British cinema. The director Thorold Dickinson (1903-84) made only a handful of features and shorts during his career, which concluded with a long stint (at the Slade School of Fine Art in London) as Britain's first officially appointed professor of film. He remains best known for two rip-roaring thrillers he considered commercial quickies: the tense and claustrophobic 1940 version of Patrick Hamilton's stage play ''Gaslight'' and the genuinely creepy ghost story ''The Queen of Spades'' (1949). Both films will be shown in a weeklong retrospective of Dickinson's work that begins on Wednesday under the auspices of the Film Society of Lincoln Center. Both happen to star the Austrian actor Anton Walbrook (''The Red Shoes'') as a schemer who seduces a naïve young woman in his drive to realize uncontrollable obsessions: the possession of a set of rubies in ''Gaslight'' (Wednesday and March 23, also starring Diana Wynyard, above) and of the Devil's own method of winning at cards in ''Spades'' (March 21 and March 22)."
2008-03-14T00:00:00Z,"BRUCE NAUMAN: 'DRAWINGS FOR INSTALLATIONS' Ask almost anyone for a short list of the most influential contemporary artists, and Bruce Nauman's name will be there. This survey of drawings related to his architecturally scaled installations, ranging from 1968 to the present, suggests why. Some are preliminary sketches for later completed projects. Others are second-thought variations made after a piece was done. Still others -- a series of studies for underground installations, for example -- are hard-core conceptual projects realized only on paper. Above, ''Untitled (Drain 1/Drain 2),'' from 1978. In most cases the planned installation is based on the construction of a plain, empty, oddly configured space in some way designed to elicit paranoia, boredom and amusement in varying degrees. We are invited to inch sideways down a narrow space between walls. Or to walk down a corridor that hits a dead end when the walls meet in a point. Or to enter a cubicle flooded by a jaundice-yellow light that makes us more and more uneasy the longer we stay."

Snapshots -- small prints with basic compositions, smiling faces and commonplace subject matter -- have not traditionally interested professional photographers and art historians. But in recent years scholars have started taking such photographs much more seriously, not only as revealing artifacts of American society but also as works of art in themselves. Since 2002, Frank Maresca, a Brooklyn-born photographer and art dealer who specializes in the folk art of self-taught and ''outsider'' artists, has donated nearly 600 snapshots, most of them taken from the 1920s to the 1960s, to the Newark Museum.

Erica lived each day rooted with a firm belief that her resources were granted by the Almighty to benefit others. She taught members of her family, her huge circle of friends and countless others that the meaning of life was not acquiring but giving. When one considers the range and scope of the charitable activities to which she was devoted, and the personal involvement and caring that she exhibited as a lay leader, one understands the definition of a true philanthropic role model. When one realizes the joy, happiness, peace of mind and healing that she helped to provide, the religious and secular knowledge she helped to foster, and the wonderful aesthetic sense that she brought to so many organizations and institutions, one begins to understand the depth of her persona.

The Rechler Family mourns the passing of Roger Rechler, a loving and devoted husband to Evelyn, father, grandfather, brother and uncle, a true renaissance man who made personal and professional contributions that shaped the landscape of Long Island, enhanced the world of real estate, and touched the lives of many. Co-founder of Reckson Associates and Managing Partner of Rechler Equity Properties, Rogers remarkable career was rivaled only by his accomplishments as a human being, including his passionate pursuit of a myriad of cultural interests that brought light and joy to the lives of all who surrounded him. His kindness, generosity and loyalty were returned with tremendous love from his family and a large community of friends who will forever keep his memory in their hearts. Born February 1942 and raised in the Bronx, Roger grew up in a loving family and developed a great entrepreneurial spirit. In 1968 Roger and his older brother Donald joined their father William in establishing Reckson Associates whose developments were bold and groundbreaking, changing the way commercial real estate was built and used on Long Island and throughout the region through innovations in upgrading industrial properties, reviving obsolete buildings, and setting new standards for office developments. Roger was the undisputed expert leading the construction and development of the companys many properties, executing each project with excellence. Joined by the third generation of Rechlers in the 1980s, Reckson Associates grew and eventually became a public company with more 25 million square feet of space across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Roger returned to his private entrepreneurial development roots as a Managing Partner with Rechler Equity Partners, the largest real estate developer, operator and owner on Long Island, with more than 100 properties. The opportunity to build beautiful and functional properties up to the end gave him tremendous satisfaction. Roger brought his trademark brilliance and distinction to all his undertakings, including the assembly of one of the largest collections of American classic literature; his accomplishments as a gourmet chef; his avid studies of architecture, landscape architecture, history, politics and sports; and leadership in the sport of purebred dogs. Roger was a towering figure in the breeding, showing and owning of dogs, specifically Afghan Hounds, since the early 1970s and making history for winning over 300 Best in Show awards with his family's 100 Grandeur champions. One of his champions achieved the ultimate distinction of being the number one show dog of all breeds in the United States in 1995 and a Westminster Kennel Club Group Winner. Roger will forever be known for the foundations of family and friendships he built just as beautifully as his buildings. He is survived by his wife Evelyn; his brother Donald; his children Gregg and Lisa; Scott and Debby; Todd and Michele; and Bill; his grandchildren children Wylie, Gabrielle, Elijah, Bailey and Logan.

Among them were the guitarist Pat Metheny and the tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman, two high-profile signings. Mr. Metheny, far right, is one of the only jazz musicians with a following worthy of a rock star; Mr. Redman, near right, has been a hero of the jazz mainstream at least since his precocious 1993 Warner Brothers album ''Wish,'' which featured Mr. Metheny. (They also share a bond with another Nonesuch acquisition, the pianist Brad Mehldau, who has now recorded and toured with each of them.) Perhaps not entirely by coincidence, Mr. Metheny and Mr. Redman each have New York engagements in a trio format next week. Mr. Metheny, 53, will perform at Town Hall on Tuesday, marking the close of a monthlong concert tour with the drummer Antonio Sanchez and the bassist Christian McBride. This is the same group heard on the recent album ''Day Trip,'' quite possibly the best of Mr. Metheny's trio recordings."

2008-03-14T00:00:00Z,"CANADIAN FRONT, 2008 Denys Arcand's satire ''Days of Darkness,'' set in the very near future, takes place largely in the mind of Jean-Marc Leblanc (Marc Labrèche, above, in a scene from the film), a middle-aged civil servant who works in the provincial citizens rights department listening to the complaints of ordinary people whose problems he is powerless to solve. As his mind wanders, this harried milquetoast entertains grandiose Walter Mitty-worthy fantasies of fame, wealth and sex with beautiful women jockeying for his favor. One reason this concluding chapter of Mr. Arcand's Quebec Trilogy, which began with ''The Decline of the American Empire'' and continued with ''The Barbarian Invasions,'' isn't as strong as its forerunners is the speed with which satire catches up with reality. But the movie takes some amusingly nasty swipes at political correctness, as when Jean-Marc is brought before a committee and reprimanded after being overheard using the word Negro."

2008-03-16T00:00:00Z,"Alexander von Vegesack was only 15 when he made his first acquisitions, at a Cairo bazaar: a Turkish coffeepot and an African spear, among other things. But throughout his career as a design historian and the director of the Vitra Design Museum, von Vegesack never lost his fascination with everyday things. It’s the glue that holds together the 2,000 objects and furnishings he’s collected over the past four decades, and also a new exhibition at the Pinacoteca Giovanni e Marella Agnelli in Turin, Italy. “Adventures With Objects” celebrates the collector’s life and travels, and his obsession with the relationship between industry and traditional crafts. The usual suspects are here — Achille Castiglioni, Charlotte Perriand, Gerrit Rietveld. But so are leather saddles and a Navajo blanket. “To understand the connection of all these different things is to understand my biography,” von Vegesack says. MONICA KHEMSUROV."

2008-03-16T00:00:00Z,"When Peter Ting was a young man studying at the Farnham School of Art, near Surrey, England, he immersed himself in the tradition of British studio pottery and handmade ceramics. There he was influenced, if indirectly, by the work of the renowned 20th-century ceramicist Bernard Leach, a pioneer of the “honestly made object.” Leach, like Ting, was born in the Far East and spent time in Japan before founding his own pottery studio in England. Several of Leach’s disciples taught at Farnham, and Ting was so inspired he traveled to Japan to visit Shoji Hamada, who was Leach’s friend and collaborator. Leach’s ability to embrace both the Japanese and the British approaches to pottery resonated with Ting: “The East-West style fits into the way I look at the world.”."
2008-03-16T00:00:00Z,"When I first saw the 85 Bulbs Chandelier, by Rody Graumans for Droog, in 1993, I was immediately attracted by the efficient way it achieved its simple shape using nothing but bare essentials — some wire, some sockets and light bulbs. I was less attracted to its not so humble price of $3,000. Normally I prefer good cheap products over good expensive ones; besides being easy on the wallet, a low price makes them more difficult to design and thus more admirable. But when I renovated my studio five years later and it turned out that I still loved it, I bit the bullet. After 10 years it is still the centerpiece of our meeting room and has not aged a bit. I have never tired of its quiet wit, and incredibly, even though I had originally purchased matching replacement light bulbs, in 10 years of usage not one of its 85 bulbs has ever burned out.

2008-03-16T00:00:00Z,"China may be set to overtake the United States in the next decade as the world’s second largest consumer of luxury goods, but the question remains whether China’s new money will put their yuan behind products made — let alone designed — in their own backyard. “China Design Now,” at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London through July 13, takes an expansive view of China’s burgeoning design culture. Still, the fact that the curators saw fit to include projects like Rem Koolhaas’s CCTV headquarters and Herzog & de Meuron’s Olympic stadium as well as a pair of Nike Air Force 1’s could be taken as a hint. Meanwhile, the KT Wong Charitable Trust has commissioned the Chinese artist Shao Fan to create a garden for the Royal Horticultural Society Chelsea Flower Show in May. Fan’s design (above, right), which brings a contemporary perspective to the traditional scholar’s garden, is an elegant example of the Wong Trust’s ambition to foster an East/West exchange of a decidedly more cerebral nature.

2008-03-16T00:00:00Z,"When the sculpture garden by Philip Johnson opened at the Museum of Modern Art in 1953, the paving stones of “cloudy” Carrara marble were meant to last forever. Unfortunately, during the museum’s recent renovation, many of the marble slabs broke. And since the original stone was no longer available, the entire lot had to be replaced. Enter Gil Shapiro and his design company Urban Archaeology in TriBeCa. Vintage marble from the Modern is not something he could pass up, so Shapiro bought all 600 remaining slabs, each measuring 30 inches by 58 inches. The slabs have since been used to decorate pools, garden paths, fancy loft buildings in TriBeCa and even bathrooms. The Shapiro-designed “MoMA Stone Washstand” is now available to order from Urban Archaeology’s salvage collection. ANDREAS KOKKINO."

2008-03-16T00:00:00Z,"Last June, among the slick, limited-edition minimalist and staid blue-chip vintage pieces at Design Miami/Basel, the locally based Chart Foundation showed a group of 1980s furniture designs that were notable for their raw, awkward energy and sharp social and aesthetic commentary. The most striking of these was a chair by the Zurich architect Stefan Zwicky. A sly poke at Le Corbusier’s famous Grand Confort chair, with its shiny tubular steel frame embracing fat leather cushions, Zwicky’s version is rendered in unforgiving concrete and framed in crude steel reinforcing bar. Provocative and gleefully anti-functional, it brought back memories of that heady, subversive decade in which seemingly anything went."

But these were nothing compared to the three orphaned grizzly bears for whom he has been commissioned to design a habitat in Alaska. “They might act like teddy bears, but they could devour you,” Trimble says. “And probably would if you got too close.” Getting (safely) close to the animals was just one of Trimble’s directives in creating the Bears of Alaska Discovery Center, an educational facility outside Anchorage. He was also asked to include a walk-in freezer for storing moose meat and an exhibition space for teaching humans bear safety. Trimble’s design, both environmentally and animal friendly, is an homage to indigenous Eskimo architecture, which he says “is the ultimate in sustainable green living: planted roof, locally sourced timbers, natural light and heat retention.” No doubt Patron and JB (siblings whose mother was shot) and Hugo (who was found limp after trying to eat a porcupine) will feel at home.

2008-03-16T00:00:00Z,"The husband-and-wife designers Jonathan Levien and Nipa Doshi have become famous for their melding of English austerity with Indian vibrancy (see their Charpoy collection for Moroso). But their newest project, a collaboration with the venerable English shoemaker John Lobb Ltd., is decidedly more Anglo. Realizing that reinventing the shoe was out of the question, their company, Doshi Levien, named the project “Apprentice” in deference to the master cobbler’s time-honored techniques. Their designs subtly tweak traditional handmade details: a scalloped cutaway side panel here, a traditional English brogue whose perforations snake around the shoe there. Bowler hats not included.

2008-03-16T00:00:00Z,"When artists started using paint straight from the can in the 1960s and early ’70s, they forfeited their personal take on color and gave themselves over to the dictates of the mass market. “Color Chart: Reinventing Color, 1950 to Today,” a new show at the Museum of Modern Art through May 12 (sponsored, appropriately enough, by Benjamin Moore), looks at the start of what became a color revolution. With the arrival of fast-drying acrylics and other mass-produced paints heavily marketed to a nation of do-it-yourselfers, art began to resemble a ready-made commodity, taking its hues from packaging, billboards, magazines and comic strips."

2008-03-16T00:00:00Z,"Now it’s China’s turn. The signs of progress that have marred Europe and America for the past century have lately been unleashed in the world’s fastest growing economy, and the eyewitnesses are lining up to testify. Not surprisingly, money is talking loud enough to drown out any dissent, as the fate of an ancient society increasingly rests in the hands of real estate developers. If ever there were an exercise in urban planning, this is it: how to modernize a civilization without obliterating its heritage; how to accommodate density without compromising quality of life; how to learn from the mistakes of the so-called developed countries, now congested and polluted, their major cities homogenized and colonized by the same handful of global brands."
2008-03-16T00:00:00Z,"The legendary Italian architect Andrea Branzi has spent more time trying to break things down than he has trying to build them up. A new show of his work at the Fondation Cartier in Paris (March 28 to June 22) is a case in point. Branzi has created two installations: an elliptical enclosure woven from glass, metal, hemp and plant matter; and a sort of decorative gazebo containing a modular work/sleep unit (above). Difficult to understand as actual structures, perhaps, but elegant metaphors for a society whose needs have become more fluid — and to which architecture has yet to fully catch up. ALIX BROWNE."
2008-03-16T00:00:00Z,"John Brady and Willard Ford know that consuming less is one way to cut your carbon footprint. Nevertheless, the two former bike racers joined forces in 2006 to open the FordBrady design gallery in downtown Los Angeles, with the explicit purpose of selling furniture. Much of that furniture, however, is made from materials destined for landfills or incineration. Their finds, including the benches produced by the Thai company Osisu from compressed milk cartons and reclaimed teak, or the Fast Forward Chair by Chulaphun Chulanond (above), have attracted clients like the architects Marmol Radziner, Graft Lab and Ray Kappe. Even the showroom — in a former theater on the edge of Chinatown — abides by this philosophy of reuse. A FordBrady line of outdoor furniture is in the works. STACIE STUKIN."

Her inspirations are as eclectic as they are horrific — say, Edgar Allan Poe’s “Fall of the House of Usher” or the ’70s Belgian vampire film “Daughters of Darkness.” But in her work, blood and gore are replaced with a cool detachment, “as if something bad just happened or is about to happen,” she says."

''Over five days, the race combines 250 kilometers of hiking and climbing up 800-, 900-, 1.000-meter peaks, biking across rough terrain and kayaking about 65 kilometers through the glacier fields and fjords, amongst all the icebergs. You find yourself being guided into parts of Greenland where you wouldn't go unless you were a very experienced adventurer. It pushes you beyond the limits -- but safely. I was truly impressed with how the local community was already adapting to climate change, having to fundamentally change the way they live. This race is part of them deciding not to go for mass tourism, but to go for a very special kind of tourism, not ruining the environment, but bringing people to it in a very open way.''

2008-03-16T00:00:00Z,"PADDOCK--William Carson , a plant pathologist credited with writing extensively on world food issues and population, died on February 28, 2008 in Antigua, Guatemala. He was 86 and died from complications of a stroke. Born on September 23, 1921 in Minneapolis, MN, he was the third son of Sarah Lee and Paul Ezekiel Paddock of Marshaltown, IA. He was a graduate of The Loomis School (1938) in Connecticut, and Iowa State University (1943) at Ames, IA. He served in the US Marine Corps during WWII, for which he received the Purple Heart after being gravely wounded in Okinawa, Japan. After the war, he received a Ph.D. from Cornell University in Plant Pathology and Plant Breeding. Dr. Paddock was an Assistant Professor at Pennsylvania State University and a Professor at Iowa State University prior to moving his family to Antigua, Guatemala in 1952 to serve as the Director of the Iowa State College Guatemala Tropical Research Center, where he developed Tiquisate Golden Yellow Corn--a disease resistant corn high in vitamin A. In 1957, Dr. Paddock replaced Mr. Wilson Popenoe as Director of El Zamorano, the Pan American School of Agriculture in Honduras. During his tenure, El Zamorano became the first college in Agriculture in Latin America. Dr. Paddock returned to Washington, D.C. in 1962 where he was named Director of Latin American Affairs for the National Academy of Sciences under the Kennedy Administration. Dr. Paddock's first article on the world food crisis ''Can We Make the World Feed Us All?'' appeared in the Saturday Evening Post in 1952. With his extensive knowledge of tropical agriculture, world hunger, and populations issues he went on to write and co-author several books: ''Hungry Nations.'' ''Famine-1975,'' ''We Don't Know How,'' and ''Time of Famine.'' Dr. Paddock also worked as a private consultant in tropical agricultural development. Central to his research and writings was the belief that famine and population growth were intrinsically linked and that the Green Revolution need to also address overpopulation. ''If you eliminate famine through an increase in food production and ignore overpopulation, you simply pass today's problems on to the next generation.'' Retired for many years but always active, Dr. Paddock was involved with and served on the boards of various organizations including the American Phytopathological Society, FAIR (Federation for American Immigration Reform), ZPG (Zero Population Growth), and was a founding member of the Guatemala branch of ''Democrats Abroad.'' Dr. Paddock is survived by his beloved wife and partner of 64 years, Elizabeth; his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter, Paul, Anne, and Laura Lee Paddock of West Palm Beach, FL; his daughter, Ana Livingston Paddock of Santa Fe, NM, and his granddaughter, Lee Livingston Dolan of NYC. He was predeceased by his two brothers, Paul Ezekiel and Richard Lee. A memorial service will be held in Antigua, Guatemala in May and a private family service in Blue Mountain Lake, New York this summer. Letters of condolence may be sent to Elizabeth Paddock at PO Box 669004, A-308, Miami Springs, FL 33266."

She was 90 years old. Mrs. Walworth grew up on Long Island in the then-rural township of Kings Point. She graduated from the Brearley School and Smith College and received a masters degree in English literature from Radcliffe College. Mrs. Walworth was an educator at heart. While raising four children in New Canaan, she determined there were few history books aimed at middle-school children, so she co-authored three with close friend Polly Schoyer Brooks. Years later she wrote two more. Always active in New Canaan civic life, Mrs. Walworth served on the Park and Recreation Commission and on the boards of the New Canaan Library, the League of Women Voters, and the ABC ''A Better Chance'' House. As New Canaan selectwoman from 1971 through 1975, she was a strong advocate for public recreation, securing funding for new public tennis and paddle tennis courts and initiating a push that led 20 years later to the popular municipal pool at Waveny Park. Her husband Edward Walworth died in October, 2007; the two were devoted to each other for 63 years. Nancy Walworth will be remembered as a wonderful mother and friend, very funny, endlessly curious, committed and caring, always in your corner, rain or shine. She is survived by her sister, Polly Zinsser Steinway, and her brother, William Knowlton Zinsser; four children, Edward, Joyce, Seth, and Cornelia; and nine grandchildren. A third son, John, died in infancy. We all loved and admired her greatly. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the New Canaan Library, Book Group Collection.

Yet entire parishes left the emerald desperation of County Cork, Ireland, for the copper mines of Butte, fleeing a land where British occupiers had once refused to let mothers educate their children, and where famine had killed a million people in seven years' time. ... I heard something in a graveyard there about 10 years ago that has stayed with me. I was strolling through St. Patrick's Cemetery, looking for family clues. My grandmother had lived in that part of Montana for a spell, and she didn't miss it -- the 20-below-zero days, the air so full of grime that the streetlights were turned on at midday. Among the rows of Dalys and Grogans and O'Farrells I started up a conversation with a man who was tending the tombstones."

As recounted in Frederick Hartt and David G. Wilkins's ''History of Italian Renaissance Art'' (Prentice Hall, 2006), Lippi was born about 1406 into an impoverished family and entered the Monastery of the Carmine in Florence at an early age, taking his vows in 1421.

These schools are, rather, designed for women across the spectrum of Japanese society who wear kimonos for weddings, festivals, tea ceremonies and numerous other occasions. As a scholar of East Asian culture and history, I have long watched as people in Europe and North America have stereotyped Japanese and other East Asian women as sex objects, glossing Japanese and other East Asian cultures as utopias of pleasure for the gratification of Western sexual fantasies.

Bear Stearns, the 85-year-old investment bank that lay bleeding from its mortgage-inflicted wounds, agreed to sell itself to JPMorgan Chase for the still-unbelievable sum of $2 a share."
2008-03-17T11:55:09Z,It’s not surprising that Bear Stearns‘s stock plummeted Monday after JPMorgan Chase agreed to buy it for just $2 per share. The surprising part is that it didn’t plummet even more.

Sadly, the situation in Puerto Rico is replicated in countries around the world where hundreds of millions of dogs live as strays, abandoned by the humans they have come to depend on for food, shelter and companionship. Change will take place only when governments work with local and international animal welfare groups and concerned individuals to address the root of the problem through education and humane methods of population control, such as spaying and neutering. As one animal advocate put it, ''we need to work together and keep the finger in the side of government.''

I didn’t use knowingly campaign funds. I didn’t use state funds at all. I know that. I don’t think institutionally there were any violations here.

But Senator Obama didn't choose: he criticized Reverend Wright's statements as wrong and divisive without being willing to distance himself from the pastor who has been so instrumental in the development of his religious faith.

Muriel was married to Bunny Freeman on September 17, 1937 until his untimely passing in 1972 at 55 years old. He was an avid golfer and encouraged her to take up the sport.

Wharton of Floral Park, NY, our chairman emeritus, who was instrumental in guiding LIJ Medical Center's growth from a community hospital in the 1950s to one of the region's preeminent teaching hospitals. A lawyer and expert in real estate financing, he became LIJ Medical Center's fifth chairman in 1976 and personally raised millions of dollars on behalf of the hospital. He was dedicated to many healthcare and social causes, and was instrumental in establishing medical school affiliations on behalf of North Shore-LIJ hospitals. His late wife Sally was one of the founders of the LIJ Service Guild. He is survived by his son Geoffrey P. Wharton, also a North Shore-LIJ trustee, and his near and dear friend Ruth Donner. We extend our most sincere condolences to the entire family. Contributions may be made in his memory to the North Shore-LIJ Health System. Saul Katz, Chairman Michael Dowling, President and CEO WHARTON--Irving. A treasured confidant, a true gentleman, and a tireless fundraiser. Irving, you set the standard for the definitions of devoted friend and dedicated trustee. Your passing creates a void that can not be filled.

2008-03-19T00:00:00Z,"Webster Hall, a 19th-century East Village assembly space where F. Scott Fitzgerald once reveled and Emma Goldman urged social change, was one of several buildings designated historic landmarks on Monday by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Designed by Charles Rentz and built in 1886, with an annex added in 1992, Webster Hall, a Renaissance Revival structure at 119-125 East 11th Street, is clad in red Philadelphia pressed brick with brownstone trim and red terra-cotta ornamentation. (A mansard roof was destroyed in the 1930s.) The hall, seen above in the 1910s, became famous for masquerade balls after a 1913 fund-raiser for the socialist magazine The Masses and became a hub not only for Village bohemians but also for gay men and lesbians. The artists Charles Demuth, Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray used the hall, as did F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and political and labor leaders like Goldman, Samuel Gompers, Margaret Sanger and Dorothy Day. The Progressive Labor Party was established there in 1887, and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America in 1914. In the 1950s and ’60s, RCA Victor operated a studio there, where Arthur Rubinstein, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Marian Anderson and many others recorded. Webster Hall later became a rock club. Three other East Village structures also received landmark designation: the 11th Street Public Bath, at 539 East 11th Street, a Beaux-Arts structure designed by Arnold W. Brunner and completed in 1906; the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol Anshe Ungarn, at 242 East Seventh Street, a Beaux Arts synagogue built in 1908 for a congregation of Hungarian Jews; and the Elizabeth Home for Girls, at 307 East 12th Street, a High Victorian Gothic brick and sandstone structure built in 1892 for use by the Children’s Aid Society."

Allen developed inventive resources to help prolong the legacy of the works, including the printed notation of Jerome Robbins' original staging of ''Fiddler On The Roof'' (still used today by schools and theatres around the world). His spirit and memory is kept alive by his wife of 44 years, Rosemarie, and his children, Marc, daughter-in-law Lisa, and grandchildren Cooper and Gabrielle of Wilmington, NC and daughter Gabrielle Stevenson, son-in-law Doug and grandchildren Kendall, Brett, Hailey and Kyle of Southport, CT. Freddie Gershon and the MTI family mourn for him and his family and honor his memory and his life's work and mission every day at MTI."

2008-03-19T00:00:00Z,"Five years have passed since I stood on the border of Iraq and Kuwait, watching the predawn sky for the first salvos in the Iraq war. I am reading political analysis and historical accounts of years that are past. I am thinking of all of the things that had not yet happened as I stood in the desert sand that day. Whatever war is, it is a deeply personal experience for those who live in it. I am a photographer and have captured thousands of images of Iraq and the war there since that day. But when I stop reading about the war, I guess I get that faraway look I always saw, as I grew up, in the eyes of countless veterans and civilians who lived through war, including my mother. I don't wonder what they see anymore."

Facing in hiring fluctuations, military leave and recruitment challenges, a low point of 34,624 officers is projected for the end of June. That is just below the 34,641 officers in June 1993, a time when a program by Mayor David N. Dinkins to pump up the police force was under way. The number peaked in October 2000 with 40,800 officers.

Officials issued a stern warning that corrupt workers will be punished, but said the failure to inspect the crane on March 4 was almost certainly not a factor in the deadly collapse, which officials think may have been caused by the failure of a nylon strap, which led to a large steel collar coming loose."

At practically 38 degrees Celsius everyday in Australia and with no rain and only sun, you'd have thought it was the Kuala Lumpur race.

2008-03-20T00:00:00Z,"The Sundance Channel, a joint venture of NBC Universal, the CBS Corporation and the actor and director Robert Redford, is up for sale, a media analyst said Wednesday. Sundance, a 12-year-old cable channel currently accessible to 26 million homes, is seeking more than $400 million, according to the analyst, Richard Greenfield of Pali Research. A spokeswoman for the channel declined to comment in an e-mail message. If neither NBC nor CBS decide to take full ownership, Mr. Greenfield said, Cablevision, Time Warner and Viacom could be interested. Some cable customers receive Sundance as part of a digital channel package; others must subscribe separately. The Sundance Channel promotes itself as “independent-minded” and shows films, documentaries and original programming. It operates separately from the Sundance Film Festival but seeks a similar audience. Its programs include “Iconoclasts,” in which two famous people interview each other, and the environmentally oriented series “The Green.” Rather than running standard commercials, the channel has allowed marketers to sponsor specific programs."
