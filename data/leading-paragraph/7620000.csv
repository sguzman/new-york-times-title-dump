Employing only the sparsest dialogue, Mr. Collins trusts his precisely self-contained images (exquisitely photographed by Jeremy Saulnier) and the subtle skills of his actors to communicate the shifting emotions of an awkward love triangle. Its anchor is a gentle, wistful nanny (John Merriman) whose eyes radiate anxiety."

Gigi, who in addition to the hair salon runs a neighborhood wine bar, opened Marshall in 2009.

2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"There's so much that's wrong with ''A Little Bit of Heaven,'' including its misleading title (think further south and then head toward the ninth circle), that it's hard to know where to begin. For starters, when did cancer become funny? Not that it's ever hilarious, even in laugh-lined movies like ''Funny People'' and ''50/50,'' to name two comedy-drama amalgams that combine cancer and chuckles in one improbable package. Certainly it isn't funny in ''A Little Bit of Heaven,'' a cringe-inducing romantic comedy turned cancer tragedy turned inspirational hosanna about living in the moment, embracing your bliss and other clichés. Kate Hudson stars as Marley Corbett, an advertising whiz and self-described slut who lives in New Orleans, where the sun doesn't just shine but also bathes her in radiant, honeyed light. Life is just one long and lovely feminine hygiene commercial: She has a cool apartment in the French Quarter; a slobbering dog named Stanley; and the modern miss's equivalent of the faithful companion, a gay black friend, Peter (Romany Malco), a Chingachgook for the age of Bravo TV. On backup there's the married mom friend, Renee (Rosemarie DeWitt), and a kooky singleton, Sarah (Lucy Punch). Marley also has a hookup book that she regularly dips into for recreational sex. As she explains in the voice-over: ''The whole matrimonial, maternal fairy tale'' isn't for her."

Since then ''The Scream'' has been subjected to the hard glare of the public spotlight. Two of the four existing versions of it have, at different times, been stolen from Oslo museums and later recovered. On Wednesday an 1895 pastel version of the picture sold for $119.9 million at Sotheby's in New York, setting an auction record and proving, yet again, that whatever shape the economy is in, there's no limit to private cash and art is a place where people like to park it."

2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Recentresearch by economists from the International Monetary Fund and academia offers some new insights about income inequality, with important implications. The researchers compared the top 5 percent of United States households from 1983 to 2007 with the remaining 95 percent. What they found is that as the rich got richer in the decades before the Great Recession, everyone else tried to maintain his standard of living by going deeper into debt. As income inequality grew over that period so did debt levels, because the rich increasingly invested their growing wealth in bonds and bank deposits, in effect providing money for ever more lending to the poor and middle class."

Another explanation is that the blondness was inherited from distant ancestors -- European traders and explorers who came to the islands. But that's not the case, researchers now report. The gene variant responsible for blond hair in the islanders is distinctly different from the gene that causes blond hair in Europeans."

Despite the company's growing Web sales, Mr. Braverman never liked its domain name, Nutsonline.com, which he'd bought in 1999. Last fall, he decided to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy a new name, Nuts.com, from a squatter. And on January 6, after the holiday season, he filed a change-of-address form and reopened on the new site. But despite high hopes and careful planning, the site's traffic took a dive, especially in terms of organic search traffic. The site, which had been averaging more than 30,000 visits each week from non-paid Google searches, saw its non-paid traffic fall 70 percent two weeks after the switch. Almost three months later, it was still down more than 50 percent. That cost the company 100 to 150 orders a day, Mr. Braverman said."

2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO -- In the muddy darkness that blankets the stage in the opening minutes of ''The Iceman Cometh'' at the Goodman Theater here, human forms seem to be slumped on battered chairs and tables in the back room of a dingy saloon. Curled or contorted into lifeless poses, they resemble slumbering animals, some starved to the bone, others bloated and sluggish. It is only as the livid yellow light of dawn seeps into the room, and one by one they are jerked to life from the warm embrace of sleep, that we can make out the ravaged contours of their faces and, when speech comes at last, the ravaged souls beneath the wax-paper skin."

There was the time when the performance artist Marina Abramovic sat stock-still for 700 hours, staring at the hundreds of worshipful visitors who came to gaze into her soul. And the time when the artist pair Allora & Calzadilla presented ''Stop, Repair, Prepare: Variations on 'Ode to Joy' for a Prepared Piano.'' The two cut a hole in the case of Bechstein baby grand and set it on casters, then hired musicians to play Beethoven's ''Ode to Joy'' from inside the hole while maneuvering the piano slowly through the space. There was also the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson's rotating metal fan, which swung from a cable just above head height. Next will be a garage sale. MoMA curators and officials have already started clearing out their closets and attics to recreate ''Meta-Monumental Garage Sale'' by the Brooklyn artist Martha Rosler."

And they defended their decision not to send troops to the scene for hours, saying they did not want to escalate the fighting as the clashes intensified in the Abbaseya neighborhood and residents watched, horrified, from balconies. When the security services finally were called in, 12 hours after the conflict erupted, the scene became quiet.

2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"A few weeks ago, we invited readers to make an argument for the ethics of eating meat. Thousands of readers submitted essays, and thousands more voted on the finalists that we posted online. Our panel of judges -- Mark Bittman, Jonathan Safran Foer, Andrew Light, Michael Pollan and Peter Singer -- chose the essay below as the winner. It will be published in the May 6 issue of the magazine. As a vegetarian who returned to meat-eating, I find the question ''Is meat-eating ethical?'' one that is in my head and heart constantly. The reasons I became a vegetarian, then a vegan and then again a conscientious meat-eater were all ethical. The ethical reasons of why NOT to eat meat are obvious: animals are raised and killed in cruel conditions; grain that could feed hungry people is fed to animals; the need for pasture fuels deforestation; and by eating meat, one is implicated in the killing of a sentient being. Except for the last reason, however, none of these aspects of eating meat are implicit in eating meat, yet they are exactly what make eating some meat unethical. Which leads to my main argument: eating meat raised in specific circumstances is ethical; eating meat raised in other circumstances is unethical. Just as eating vegetables, tofu or grain raised in certain circumstances is ethical and those produced in other ways is unethical."

A Congressional Research Service report identifies 483 facilities in 43 states where a chemical disaster would put 100,000 or more people at risk. In 2002, Christine Todd Whitman, then the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for President George W.

Industry fought back, claiming that the law would be too cumbersome and costly. The White House caved and refused to submit the bill."

My preference is for her plush-evening-length dances -- the transcendent ''Time is the echo of an ax within a wood'' or her African dance-tinged ballet, ''Itutu.'' Alas, her latest evening, ''Werk!: The Armitage Gone Variety Show'' is of the bits-and-pieces persuasion."

His jailers made death threats, shackled him for hours, forced him into painful stress positions, subjected him to noxious fumes that hurt his eyes and nose and deafening noises at all hours, denied him care for serious illness and more. This treatment was indisputably cruel, inhumane and shocking, in breach of the minimum standard required for anyone in American custody, especially a citizen. Some of it was torture, though Mr. Padilla should not have had to prove that to show his treatment was unconstitutional."

James Bell is St. John Rivers, the young clergyman who helps to nurse Jane back to health; Judi Dench, the gossipy housekeeper; Sally Hawkins, the nasty aunt; and Imogen Poots, the pretty rich girl who almost derails Jane's chances in love. ''Reader, I liked it,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''This 'Jane Eyre,' energetically directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre') from a smart, trim script by Moira Buffini ('Tamara Drewe'), is a splendid example of how to tackle the daunting duty of turning a beloved work of classic literature into a movie.

2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"''NO opera plot can be sensible,'' W. H. Auden wrote, ''for people do not sing when they are feeling sensible.'' More than any major poet of his era, Auden, who died in 1973, dabbled in serious forms of musical drama. Opera's wildness and implausibility took him places where poems, or intellect alone, couldn't go. He longed, on occasion, to break into song. The 33-year-old Auden is among the central figures in a word-drunk new musical, ''February House,'' that shuttles organically between literary sense and harmonic sensibility. Auden, I suspect, would have admired ''February House,'' which begins previews Tuesday at the Public Theater, and not just because this snippet of his poem ''Refugee Blues,'' sung by its young cast, seems to set the play's emotional tone:"

If that puppet came to life it might look something like the actor Tom Edden in the British comedy ''One Man, Two Guvnors,'' now on Broadway at the Music Box Theater. Although Mr. Edden has a scant 20 or so lines and just one big set piece in the two-and-a-half-hour show, he is doing some old-fashioned scene stealing and getting some of the biggest laughs of the season. Dressed in a ratty outfit, with a head of wispy white hair and heaps of makeup, Mr. Edden plays Alfie, a wild-eyed but slow-moving octogenarian waiter who is enlisted to help Francis (played by James Corden) serve his two bosses a pub lunch of soup, cold meats and chicken balls. The problem? It's Alfie's first day on the job. That and he has cataracts, is just this side of deaf, leans to one side, slurs his speech (it's that contorted mouth), has a pacemaker and the shakes.

2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"When Julia Glass's first novel, ''Three Junes,'' was the surprise winner of the National Book Award for fiction in 2002, the stunned author's initial words, upon reaching the podium, were wonderfully telling: ''I think I felt emotions this intense only two other times in my life, and that's when my newborn baby sons were put in my arms. Only a whole lot fewer people were watching.'' Candor and humor are qualities Glass has in common with Anne Tyler, whose work Glass began reading in her mid-20s, when she was a painter. ''Never mind,'' Glass admitted in a recent e-mail, ''that I was perpetually cheating on MoMA by sneaking off to the Strand. When I lost myself in a book, I was just another story addict, a gushing fan -- not the ambitious student, the covetous admirer, even the would-be poacher.'' Unlike Tyler, Glass hasn't stayed anchored in one fictional locale. The Greenwich Village base of her early fiction has, in succeeding books, expanded to encompass the American Southwest and the New England of her youth. Yet ''The Whole World Over,'' ''I See You Everywhere'' and ''The Widower's Tale'' share with ''Three Junes'' -- and with Tyler's novels -- a deep appreciation of the rhythms of daily life, wherever it's being lived. So it seems fitting that Glass's first contribution to the Book Review should be devoted to Tyler's new novel, ''The Beginner's Goodbye.'' ''She feels,'' Glass explained, ''like someone with whom I've been having a long, imaginary conversation. Not just a heroine but a companion in the exploration of something so close it's nearly impossible to see: the tidal pull of family, community and plain old dumbstruck love.''"

On the Union Street Bridge he'd pause to hear, carried on the chemically compromised air wafting up from the Gowanus Canal underfoot, the high, lonesome singing of the stray dogs that roamed the neighborhood. Rather improbably, the Gowanus section of Brooklyn has, over the last several years, come into its own as a scrappy cultural district.

2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"The city board of Helsinki, Finland, has shot down a proposal to build a $185 million Guggenheim Museum along the city's waterfront, Reuters reported on Wednesday. The vote, which was 8-to-7 against the project, comes at a time when governments are slashing budgets throughout Europe. In January 2011 Helsinki commissioned the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation to conduct a feasibility study examining the possibility of building a Guggenheim there. Among the recommendations were that it be sited on city-owned land on Helsinki's South Harbor waterfront and that its architect be selected in an international competition. The museum itself, the study said, should be midsize, about 129,000 square feet with 42,000 square feet of exhibition space, and should be run largely as a non-collecting institution. The study also estimated attendance would be about a half-a-million visitors a year."

2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"TURNER--Howard, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Turner Construction Company, died on April 24th, 2012 at the age of 100. Turner Construction Company was founded in 1902 by Howard Turner's uncle, Henry Chandlee Turner. Born in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania in 1911, Howard graduated from George School in 1929, Swarthmore College in 1933, and MIT in 1936 with a PhD in organic chemistry. Upon graduation, Howard joined the DuPont Corporation as a research chemist. He then joined Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Company in 1946 to lead their new research and development division. In 1954, Howard joined Jones & Laughlin Steel Company as the Vice President of research and development. Howard joined the Board of Directors of Turner Construction Company in 1952 and in 1965, was selected to serve as President of Turner Construction Company. He served as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1968 to 1971 and Chairman of the Board from 1971 to 1978. From 1978 to 1982, he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee. Under his leadership, the company grew from seven to twenty offices in cities across the United States, formalized its community affairs program, and established the Turner School of Construction Management for minorities and women. During this time the company also launched its international division with operations in four countries and the company's sales grew from $591 million in 1965 to $1.7 billion by 1978. On the occasion of Howard's retirement from Turner, he said, ""To lead this company, itself a leader among builders, has been an honor and an exciting opportunity for which I am most grateful. Turner has always been known for its depth of talent, regularly fed from the best of each year's college graduates. The company's growth will, as in the past, be based on the character and high standards of the Turner staff, its commitment to serve its clients and the satisfaction all Turner people feel in making a contribution to building lasting monuments of our civilization."" A service for friends and family will be held at the Swarthmore Friends Meeting House on the Swarthmore Campus at 12:00 noon on Saturday, May 5th. Donations in lieu of flowers, can be made to American Friends Service Committee or the Carter Center."
2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said Wednesday that the conditions that led to the Feb. 14 fire that killed 361 people at the Comayagua national prison were the result of decades of neglect of Honduras's prisons and iron-fisted anticrime policies. A commission delegation that visited the prison and two others late last month concluded that the ''most worrisome'' problem in Honduras's prisons was that the authorities had effectively ceded control to the prisoners themselves, in part because guards were not properly trained. This ''has led to high levels of violence and corruption, in a context of absolute impunity,'' the commission said. The delegation also found severe overcrowding, as well as unsafe housing and inadequate food, water and medical care."

Over the last few years, the company has avoided paying billions of dollars in state and federal taxes by routing profits through subsidiaries based in tax havens from Reno, Nev., to the Caribbean. This is a common practice among major American businesses, and back in 1787, Madison saw it coming. Someday, he warned, companies could grow so large they ''would pass beyond the authority of a single state, and would do business in other states.'' To make sure the companies remained accountable to government, he said the federal government should ''grant charters of incorporation in cases where the public good may require them, and the authority of a single state may be incompetent.''"

His analyses are thorough and clear, and he presents them, at public meetings and straight to Ms. Yu's camera, with good-natured patience. For the most part, that is. At one point, contemplating a future of unchecked consumption and political paralysis, he sums it all up in blunt layman's terms: ''We're screwed.'' That might serve as an alternative name for Ms. Yu's film, or even for the genre to which it belongs. The global-catastrophe documentary is a thriving form these days, as the apparent unsustainability of human life has emerged as fertile ground for cinematic journalism.

It was the third and final night of ''doubles'' at Albertsons. This biweekly happening, during which the store issues coupons that double the value of manufacturers' coupons, is to dedicated coupon clippers what the full moon was to Druids. Yoder and Knight, who are Mormon and have nine children between them (Yoder: seven; Knight: two) had spent the day working on their blog and then taught a three-hour couponing class -- all without a drop of forbidden caffeine. Yet with the supermarket in sight, they grew visibly jazzed, like Vegas high rollers entering a casino. ''We'll have it all to ourselves, and we'll know all the cashiers,'' Knight said. Within minutes, Knight -- a part-time dental hygienist with glossy, nearly waist-length blond hair and enviable white teeth -- had discovered a sale on StarKist tuna fish. ''Oh, Cathy, the tuna's a dollar right now!'' she said, as she stood before a shelf containing shiny blue plastic pouches of chunk-light tuna. A bulging nylon binder, which she had seated like a toddler in the front of her cart, held six StarKist coupons for 50 cents off; paired with Albertsons coupons, they were worth a dollar each, the same price as the tuna. ''So it's free right now,'' she continued. ''And we haven't even blogged about it!''"

Theories abound about what happened to the so-called Lost Colony, ranging from sober scholarship to science fiction. Some historians believe that the colonists might have been absorbed into American Indian tribes. Other explanations point to darker fates, like disease, an attack by Spaniards or violence at the hands of Indians. The wild-eyed fringe hints at cannibalism and even alien abduction."

Who exactly is the joke on this time, and will they get it? And what happens when the most aggressive and confrontational satirist in contemporary comedy has to make do without real-life foils and stooges? ''The Dictator,'' which opens May 16, confirms Mr. Baron Cohen's knack for distilling exaggerated stereotypes, political triggers and cultural hot buttons into a single, monumentally ridiculous figure. But it also inaugurates a new phase of his career, not least for introducing his first new persona in more than a decade. The three daredevil buffoons in his repertoire -- the British gangsta poseur Ali G, the Kazakh simpleton Borat, the Austrian fashionista Bruno -- were developed on his series ''Da Ali G Show.''

Mr. Huffman, an interior decorator from Monroe, N.C., brought a touch of levity and style to a courtroom that for almost two weeks has been strained by the grim and sometimes plodding details of Mr. Edwards's secret relationship as he sought the 2008 Democratic nomination for president."

It started running here this week near the estate where Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt lived and where the modern presidency began to take shape. The ride isn't something radical. It is not a roller coaster veering through simulated landscapes of the Depression or coursing over virtual World War II battlefields. It doesn't rely on high-tech innovations to make the intricacies of the New Deal more palpable. It feels commonplace, scarcely worth noticing. The Roosevelt Ride is a free shuttle bus."

''I've never visited Miami,'' she said, ''but in my head it's this joyful place and color extravaganza.'' Ms. Wackerhausen, who introduced her Wackerhaus label in Copenhagen in 2003, researched Miami architecture, night life and beach babes, creating her own happy place called South Pastel Beach. And given her novel imagination, her pretty pastels seem fresher, less familiar than the myriad others we've already seen for spring. The soft pink blazer with powdery pastel accents shown here, if worn with light denim or stark summer whites, will kick sand in the face of the clichéd ''Miami Vice'' look."

The votes will once again highlight the emerging crux of the euro crisis: Will democratic politics offer a solution to the economic crisis or just make it worse? Anxieties are rising again over the shared currency, and these elections are likely to be another blow to a German-designed austerity plan to cure the euro zone's debt and banking crisis. If the French Socialist candidate, François Hollande, wins the presidency, as the polls suggest, he plans to challenge Germany, vowing to renegotiate a European Union treaty mandating deficit and debt limits in order to add a new emphasis on economic growth."

2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"IN the Bosnian city of Mostar, a beautiful Ottoman-era limestone bridge called the Stari Most arched over the Neretva River for 427 years, surviving earthquakes and two world wars. After a barrage of shelling in 1993, during the Bosnian civil war, the bridge collapsed. Citizens were stranded on opposite sides of the riverbank. Ethnic strain wasn't the cause. It was the effect. Across the country, the war itself was dividing citizens into three ethno-nationalist clusters: Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks). Twenty years after the war began, and 17 years after the Dayton accords brought the fighting to an end, the bridge stands again, and a shallow peace prevails. But now, the compromises we made to end the killing increasingly look inadequate, and it's time to begin fixing them."

Its seven travelers are financially distressed men and women of retirement age lured by an invitation to ''outsource'' themselves for a stay at the newly opened Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur.

2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Scientists estimate that we reached Peak Superhero in the summer of 2008, when ''The Dark Knight'' sucked the attention of every critic, pundit and sentient moviegoer into its inky nexus. It is not as if the number of movies featuring troubled guys wearing costumes and fighting evil has diminished since then. Quite the contrary. But the genre, though it is still in a period of commercial ascendancy, has also entered a phase of imaginative decadence. (Do you really want to have an argument about this? If so, put on your best oversize metal suit and wait for me at the top of the New York Times building. I'll be there as soon as I finish beta-testing my death ray. Apologies in advance to any commuters crushed by flying debris.) The latest evidence -- though it is unlikely to be the last, with a new ''Spider-Man'' and another ''Dark Knight'' looming on the horizon -- is ''Marvel's The Avengers.'' You may occasionally encounter (as I have, a few times in the past months) a walking relic of an earlier era of pop-cultural fandom who wonders if they have, at last, made another movie out of that fondly recalled British spy series from the 1960s. ''They'' have not, and those poor souls who cherish old daydreams of Diana Rigg in leather will have to console themselves with images of Scarlett Johansson in a black bodysuit."

The resolution also called for both nations to remove their forces from Abyei, arguably the most iconic of numerous contested regions along the border.

2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Although fish come and go according to the season, seafood has become, like many other foods, a global commodity that can be had at any time. The soft-shell crab remains an exception. Starting in May and throughout the summer, the blue crab abandons its shell and starts to form a new one, making its sweet, briny, delicious meat -- usually incredibly tough to get at -- immediately accessible. When the crab is molting, in fact, practically the whole thing is edible, and the new shell is among the best parts. The combination of tenderness and crunch makes it one of the great delights of eating. (If you're squeamish about this, I suggest you get over it, or swear off animal products altogether.) The shell remains soft for only a few hours after the crab has molted, making timing just about everything for this industry, located mostly on the central Atlantic coast and most famously in Chesapeake Bay. But the crabs ship well and are available nationwide right now. Most soft-shell crabs you see at the market are ready to cook. This may not be the case if you're buying them from a real fishmonger, in which case you should ask to have them cleaned. At that point, I'd cook them within 24 hours; if you want to keep them longer than that, buy them live and clean them yourself."

But for the filmmaker Amos Kollek, the depression and artistic stasis that followed the failure of his 2003 film, ''Happy End'' (also called ''Nowhere to Go but Up''), was best countered by once again picking up a camera. This time, however, he turned it on himself. The result of seven years of therapeutic self-absorption, ''Chronicling a Crisis'' documents Mr. Kollek's journey to regain emotional stability and reconnect with his craft. Hopping between the cities he knows best, New York and Jerusalem, he ponders his undefined spirituality (''never been religious; won't start now'') and unresolved issues with his nonagenarian father, Teddy Kollek, whose celebrated 28-year tenure as the mayor of Jerusalem left an indelible imprint on his son's psyche."

The playful exhibition ''Ecstatic Alphabets/Heaps of Language,'' opening on Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art, borrows Smithson's title and runs wild with his vision of words as materials. Organized by the MoMA painting and sculpture curator Laura Hoptman, with help from the curatorial assistant Eleonore Hugendubel, it assembles works by artists and artist's groups who make written and spoken communication intensely physical.

2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Much of the iPad's magic -- and its success -- comes from the directness of the touch screen. For decades, you dragged a mouse on one surface to make the cursor move on another. And now, suddenly, you can tap or draw right on the screen. But at places like Pixar and Marvel, they've been happily drawing on their screens since 1992. That's when Wacom released its first pen display -- its first draw-on-the-screen tablet -- for artists."
2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"New-music groups often seem to storm through stacks of new scores as if they were airport novels, rarely giving them a second look once they've appeared on a program. That may be liberating in the sense that every program creates fresh challenges, but given the amount of work it takes to prepare a performance, it must be frustrating as well. The International Contemporary Ensemble devours repertory as hungrily as any other group of its kind, but it is also building a repertory of pieces its players consider worth revisiting. The Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho's music seems to be high on its list of keepers, and understandably so: Ms. Saariaho's colorful, involving scores keep listeners transfixed and reward repeat hearings."
2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON -- Jurors in Roger Clemens's perjury trial on Thursday had an up-close view of what prosecutors say is an important pile of trash: a partly crushed beer can, yellowed cotton balls, used syringes and empty vials -- all items the government will later contend connect Clemens to performance-enhancing drug use. It was the panel's first good look at what is probably the most damning physical evidence in the case against Clemens, who prosecutors say lied to Congress at a 2008 House hearing when he said he never used steroids or human growth hormone."
2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Could concussions hurt football as badly as steroids did baseball? It's doubtful, but in the last few years, as focus has increased on how injuries effect the long-term health of football players, it's no longer inconceivable. Alan Schwarz in The New York Times rigorously chronicled the devastating toll of concussions, including increased risk of depression and suicide. Lawsuits have been filed. Congress held hearings. And some people have questioned whether it's ethical even to watch games. The death of Junior Seau may bring even more scrutiny to this issue."

Bosh's absence was understandable. About 16 hours earlier, his wife, Adrienne, had given birth in Miami to the couple's first child, a son, Jackson. But at 6:30 p.m. Thursday, with the opening tip-off of Game 3 in the Knicks-Heat playoff series half an hour away, Bosh walked into the Heat locker room, where he was greeted by cheering teammates."
2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"One of the nation's largest pension plans filed a lawsuit Thursday accusing Wal-Mart's leadership of breaching its fiduciary duty in connection with a bribery scandal at the retailer's Mexican subsidiary. The pension plan, the California State Teachers' Retirement System, owns about 5.3 million shares in Wal-Mart, worth about $313 million. Although that is a small stake -- far less than 1 percent -- the suit was filed on behalf of Wal-Mart itself against people the pension plan identified as having failed in their duties to the company."
2012-05-03T00:00:00Z,"A tenor and a violinist have been selected as the winners of the 2012 Martin E. Segal Awards, which recognize emerging artists associated with Lincoln Center. The tenor, Paul Appleby, and the violinist, Augustin Hadelich, each received $7,500 to be used for career advancement and future study. The recipients, chosen by the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic, were honored at a lunch on Wednesday in the Stanley H. Kaplan Penthouse at Lincoln Center. Lincoln Center established the awards with a group of Mr. Segal's friends and colleagues when he retired as Lincoln Center's chairman in 1986. Since the first prize, in 1987, the endowment financing the award has given nearly $250,000 to 52 artists. The winners ''represent the best of what we hope for -- what Lincoln Center and its constituent organizations are doing and planning for the joys of great music, dance, theater, education and a country and a world at peace,'' Mr. Segal said."

Benedict Cumberbatch, who is back for a new season as Holmes on Sunday on PBS's ''Masterpiece Mystery!,'' is getting so good at his quirky portrayal that the crimes Holmes is solving are a secondary concern. Mr. Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Watson are just plain enjoyable to watch. It's all about repartee for these two; theirs is quick and sharp and often comes at the most incongruous moments. In the ''Sherlock'' season premiere Watson is giving the absent Holmes a view of a crime scene via video hookup, but Holmes is proving to be just as annoying on a laptop as he is in person."

2012-05-04T00:00:00Z,"New York City's 911 emergency dispatch system sometimes sends firefighters or police officers to the wrong address. Operators sometimes waste precious seconds and sow confusion by failing to follow a standard script when taking information from callers. And, sometimes, an emergency operator can ask eight questions about a caller's location and other details, then patch in another operator who asks six more questions, before getting to the most important one: ''What is the emergency?'' Those were among the biggest flaws highlighted in a highly anticipated report released Friday by the Bloomberg administration on its much-delayed and over-budget new 911 system, formally called the Emergency Communications Transformation Project."
2012-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Anyone who has ever renovated a house knows that construction invariably takes longer than expected. You make your decisions about floors and walls, and then weeks become months become, in some instances, years. And you realize that even when taste is a given, patience is a virtue. In this issue we feature homes that are a testament to the consistency and tenacity of their owners. For Francis Upritchard and Martino Gamper, as we learn in Marina Cashdan's profile, it was a matter of rethinking a curious apartment with no real features (and in a London housing project, no less) over time, when their artistic careers permitted, and with the help of resourceful, clever compatriots. Then there are Jason Schmidt and Bill Mullen's majestic portraits of New York style setters who dress like their sofas. Finally, in the case of Jon Rosen and Tiina Laakkonen, it was the decision to build from scratch a Scandinavian-inspired compound in Amagansett, N.Y., that was, soup to nuts, of their imagining. And did it drag on? Well, a bit. Actually, Laakkonen's journey to this house began long ago, before she met Rosen, and probably before she'd ever heard of Amagansett. I first met her when we worked together at British Vogue in the mid-1990s. She wore McQueen and Comme des Garçons evening gowns to the office, often topped off with a Philip Treacy hat. She had come to Vogue from being an assistant of Karl Lagerfeld's at Chanel. She had been shot by William Klein. Her boyfriend at the time was a rock star. We used to ''preview'' the Manolo Blahnik sample sale together, and I remember once her telling me in the too-expensive black cab ride from Mayfair to Chelsea that her dream was to one day open a small housewares store in which she could sell Finnish ceramics and wooden spoons and hand-loomed dish towels. It seemed so unlikely. Did she even cook? Did I cook? We were en route to buy severely discounted gladiator sandals in zebra and tartan. I was confused. But Tiina Laakkonen wasn't. She knew that her passion for design grew from a single tree with many branches to climb. This summer she will open her small shop, Tiina, in the Hamptons, selling almost exactly the items she'd rattled off to me 16 years ago. It's a tribute to taste and patience and vision, all of which she has in spades."

Typically, shares of the hottest initial public offerings go almost entirely to the biggest clients of the Wall Street banks that oversee the stock sale. And no I.P.O. is as big or as eagerly awaited this year as Facebook's."
2012-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Ah, if only the path to true love really were a waltz! That is what Matt Friedman, the gentle but determined hero of Lanford Wilson's Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning ''Talley's Folly,'' wants to believe. Shortly after he makes that assertion, though, he learns that there can be many a wounding stumble on that dance floor. And it's hard to imagine a more vigorous metaphor for those missteps than a 42-year-old accountant in a three-piece suit trying to balance himself on ice skates on the wooden floor of a broken-down Victorian boathouse. Until the Hudson Stage Company's charming new production, I had never seen ''Talley's Folly.'' Mr. Wilson, who died last year at 73, wrote a trilogy about the Talley family. I saw the first, ''The Fifth of July,'' with Christopher Reeve, Swoosie Kurtz and Cynthia Nixon, on Broadway, more than 30 years ago. In 1998 I reviewed a regional theater production of ''Talley & Son,'' the less well-received third play (originally presented as ''A Tale Told,'' in 1985). But somehow neither the 1979 Off Broadway production nor the 1980 Broadway run of ''Talley's Folly,'' starring Judd Hirsch and Trish Hawkins (much less the numerous regional revivals that followed), ever made it onto my calendar. It was impossible, though, to follow American theater and not know the play's reputation and its seemingly sentimental premise."

The addition of just 115,000 jobs in April was disappointing, but economists urged no panic just yet. Maybe the unusually warm winter had encouraged companies to do their spring hiring a little early, they offered in one of several theories. Maybe high gas prices, now falling, temporarily discouraged job growth. Better yet, maybe this latest report understates how many jobs were added, since the initial estimates for earlier months have been revised upward."

In a pose treasured by winners of beauty pageants (as well as trick-or-treaters and many others), Munch's figure on a bridge seems to be shrieking with -- you decide. Elation at such a fantastic figure? Horror at anyone -- it was sold to an unidentified telephone bidder -- spending so much money on a single object? Now that ''The Scream'' has moved to the top of art's 10-most-wanted list, it will be a while before we can look at the work and see only the old, familiar existential dread."

The union filed a grievance Thursday night arguing that broad language contained in the collective bargaining agreement prohibits Goodell from disciplining players for conduct committed before Aug. 4, 2011, the day the C.B.A. was signed. That would eliminate the first two years of the three-year bounty program that the N.F.L. contends was run in New Orleans, including some of the most troublesome allegations -- that the defensive captain Jonathan Vilma offered $10,000 if hits knocked Brett Favre and Kurt Warner out of playoff games in 2010."

The boy recovered, but many months and phone calls later, Mr. White's insurance company still had not paid the $200 ambulance bill, even though the insurer had assured him it was covered. He finally decided it was easier to pay it himself. But by then, it was already too late. Unbeknown to Mr. White, the debt had been reported to the credit bureaus. It was only when he and his wife went to refinance the $240,000 mortgage on their home in Lewisville, Tex., last month -- nearly six years after the accident -- that he learned the bill had shaved about 100 points from his credit score. Even with no other debts, a healthy income and otherwise pristine credit, the couple had to pay an extra $4,000 to secure a lower interest rate."

The scientist, Adlène Hicheur, 35, did not deny the exchange of messages, in which he suggested targets for terrorist strikes in France, but maintains that he never intended to act on his words. The trial has raised difficult questions about the possible excesses of French antiterrorism law, which in effect treats intent as a criminal act."

My father warned me about Barney the way fathers in fairy tales warn their children about paths that lead to the edge of a cliff or wolves that might wish to befriend us. Barney, born Barnet Lee Rosset Jr., was, in my father's eyes, the black sheep of the family. The renegade, the ne'er-do-well, the ungrateful son. He'd purchased a failing publishing company called Grove Press. He was squandering his father's fortune. He was a Communist and a pornographer. Growing up, I actually never knew my cousin Barney. Our grandmothers were sisters, and after Barnet Sr.'s mother died when he was just a boy, my grandmother took him in, raising him and my father as brothers. Then Barnet Sr. left the fold: he married young, to an Irish woman, causing a huge scandal in our Jewish household."

At that time, said Alan Valentine, the orchestra's president and chief executive, a badly needed new concert hall was a pipe dream. But thanks in large part to the name the ensemble made for itself at Carnegie and the acclaim it took back to Nashville (and thanks to the efforts of Mr. Valentine and others) it was able to raise funds for what eventually turned out to be the resplendent Schermerhorn Symphony Center, which opened in 2006."

The programs are a lifeline for the working poor -- without them many parents would have to give up their jobs and stay home to care for their children. They are also vital for children and young people who need the extra preparation the programs provide. The City Council can usually be counted on to restore some of these cuts.

The dark polished wainscoting and unobtrusive attention from well-trained gray-vested servers give Club Car the feel of a men's club.

Filmed over just four and a half days at T in the Park, the Scottish music festival, this romantic comedy required Ms. Tena to be handcuffed to Luke Treadaway, playing a California rocker, as their alter egos performed gigs and navigated unsteady relationships while searching for the key that would release them."

Especially a painter enamored of muted color, desiccated texture and minute detail. I'm sure I've passed innumerable such heaps of roadside debris without ever actually seeing them. But this time, I was headed home from Hartford after a visit to the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art and its show of some two dozen works by Andrew Wyeth.

2012-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Walter Fredrick Morrison and his girlfriend, Lucile Nay, discovered that flying discs were marketable when a stranger asked to buy the metal cake pan they were flipping through the air on a Santa Monica beach. By 1938, the couple were selling the 5-cent pans for a quarter a piece. Morrison used the proceeds to buy Nay a $35 diamond engagement ring. After a stint as an Army Air Corps pilot during World War II, Morrison tried his hand at developing ''a flying disk far superior to that of a flying cake pan.'' Together with a butane supplier named Warren Franscioni, they created the Flyin-Saucer, but it didn't go very far until Morrison created a new version in 1955, dubbed the Pluto Platter. The disc had a bump that evoked an alien cockpit on top and the names of the planets around its rim. Wham-O, the visionary toy company known for its slingshots and, soon, its Hula-Hoops, bought the rights in 1957. Wham-O renamed the flying disc Frisbee, which Morrison didn't like one bit. ''Had I been consulted, I'd have vehemently objected,'' he wrote in his account of the Frisbee business (written with Phil Kennedy),''Flat Flip Flies Straight!'' Wham-O went on to nix the alien cockpit and planetary names, opting instead for a new, sportier disc with a stripe in the center and the words ''Official Pro Model'' on top. By the mid-1960s, ''there was one of everybody's roof,'' says Robert Rauch, president of the World Flying Disc Federation. The Frisbee was, quite simply, ''cool,'' says Tim Walsh, author of a book on Wham-O. ''This thing rose on the wind.'' DISC DRIVE"

Now, as the country heads to elections on Sunday in which no single party is expected to secure enough votes to form a stable government, they may have to try governing with political chaos. Along with elections in France, and with a rising tide of anti-austerity sentiment across Europe, Greece's vote is expected to have a clear impact on the future of the euro. The next government, amid a deepening recession and facing likely social unrest, will have to enforce the country's loan agreement with its foreign creditors, which stipulates slashing $15.5 billion from the state budget over the next two years and completing a crucial bank recapitalization."

For every person who says that, you can find another person who will say, ''Elaine was a major contributor to the success of that company.'' Did I create an environment that allowed him to thrive? Did I create an anchoring to the personality that made us have good equilibrium? That's what I'd say I hope my contribution is. Is that worth a billion dollars? I have no idea how to quantify that. How much credit for the success of Wynn Resorts would your former husband give you? It depends on his mood. I think that Steve would give me credit for a lot of things, absolutely, but there are also times when he may not give me credit. But that's emotions. Sometimes you can't compartmentalize it when you've had the kind of unique relationship we've had."

That would have been Mickey Mantle's, in Game 2 of the 1951 World Series, on the game's biggest stage, in front of 66,018 at Yankee Stadium. Then came the one Thursday night to closer Mariano Rivera, while he shagged fly balls in batting practice in a mostly empty stadium in Kansas City, Mo., one of the game's smallest stages. Both injuries were to the right knee, to Yankee immortals, and both occurred in the outfield. But the parallels end there. The injuries may be better thought of as bookends: Mantle's injury came at the beginning of a career plagued by them, while Rivera's comes near the end of a career relatively free of them. Mantle's injury probably robbed him of the hope to become the game's greatest statistical performer, while Rivera's injury may have robbed his magnificent career only of one final flourish."

Frankly, that was a piece of cake compared with the difficulty of knowing what one's children were doing in college and when they were doing it. Little did I know that college was only the first step in the painful process of parental separation. Why do we talk about the children's need to separate? It's the parents who come unglued. The worst was yet to come. Departures for college turned out to be nothing compared with departures from college. Somehow, it had never occurred to me that my sons would eventually find their own homes. I had never tuned in to the dismayed chorus of psychologists, amplified in the news media, sounding off about a generation of kids moving back in with their parents after college. So what?

''MetHD,'' a link to information about the local transmission of the Metropolitan Opera's ''Live in HD'' movie theater broadcasts, leads the list of the company's offerings, including two live Winston-Salem productions: Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' and Robert Ward's ''Crucible.'' With just a mouse click the site illustrates the reality of American opera today, which I observed as I traveled through the country over the last six months, watching the 11 broadcasts in this season's ''Live in HD'' series. Through the HD broadcasts the Met has attained dominance of the field: not as a standard to which regional companies can aspire, as in the past, but as a permanent and sometimes intrusive presence in their communities."

2012-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Nine years ago, when I was introduced to my future husband by a mutual friend, he was working in Nashville, and living 885 miles away, in a town house apartment in Brooklyn. To afford this unusual arrangement, he spent the three or four nights a week that he was in Tennessee at a Motel 6 -- not the Motel 6 closest to his place of employment, but a cheaper branch farther away from the interstate where the sheets, forgetting discussions of thread count, possessed the feel of something made at Union Carbide. During our first date, it did not occur to me to ask him why he chose to live in New York, where he had no familial ties, at such enormous logistical cost. Living here was the goal of all thinking people, and doing so invited complication in nearly every respect; sacrifices were to be made."

2012-05-04T00:00:00Z,"A ribbon unfurls in the colors of the Venezuelan flag, while a drum roll announces the show's title sequence and a trumpet tootles. Block-letter words pop up on the screen: ''humanity,'' ''struggle,'' ''socialism.'' It looks for all the world like a ''Daily Show'' parody. And then comes a close-up of the show's host and star, Hugo Chávez, president of Venezuela, usually dressed in all red or a military jacket, sometimes crowned with a Che-style beret, standing on the road among his supporters or before a live audience at Miraflores Palace in Caracas. The show is entirely unscripted. Chávez usually begins by stating the date and saying, ''Aló Presidente!'' then grinning and giving himself a round of applause. ''Aló Presidente!'' he repeats and you can't tell if he's introducing the program by its title or simply greeting and congratulating himself. ''Aló Presidente'' (''Hello President'') is broadcast live in Venezuela on Sundays from 11 a.m. until Chávez is done talking, which can take anywhere from four to eight hours. It is the only television show in the world in which a head of state regularly invites cameras to follow him as he governs. (Two other South American presidents, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador, briefly spun off their own shows after appearing as guests on ''Aló Presidente'' and being interviewed Oprah-style by Chávez.) But with the exception of the logorrheic Fidel Castro, it's hard to imagine another political figure with the combination of manic exhibitionism and entertainer's stamina required to star in this sort of show, never mind the autocratic control required to make it, literally, must-see TV in his home country."

And cooks who enjoy fresh ingredients can grow herbs or harvest a crop of mushrooms just an arm's length away in their own kitchen. For newlyweds who do have a yard, there is a sequoia sapling that will grow (one to three feet a year!) with the marriage, as well as new chairs to decorate a patio or terrace.

For a young lawyer, a job at any of them was the first step to the golden ring of partnership and, with it, lifetime tenure, prestige and affluence. Maybe that's why the seemingly inevitable collapse of a firm like Dewey, since renamed Dewey & LeBoeuf as a result of a 2007 merger, has so rocked the legal profession. Dewey is hardly the first major law firm to fail. Recent years have seen the demise of once-respected names like Howrey & Simon; Coudert Brothers; Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison; and Heller Ehrman. But none had the pedigree of Dewey, named for the former New York governor and presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey."

''Rebecca,'' a musical version of the Daphne du Maurier novel (which was also adapted into the Alfred Hitchcock film) had been scheduled to start performances at the Broadhurst on March 27 and open on April 22. It would have starred Tam Mutu as the well-to-do Maxim de Winter and Sierra Boggess as his new wife (known in the musical only as ''I''), who joins him at the estate that may be haunted by the ghost of his first spouse. But before any spirits could be invoked, the production was rattled when its producers announced they were unable to raise the show's $12 million capitalization and were postponing ''Rebecca'' for the 2012-13 season. The musical, which will now begin previews on Oct. 30, will retain its creative team, including the directors Michael Blakemore (''Kiss Me, Kate'') and Francesca Zambello (the general and artistic director of the Glimmerglass Festival), as well as cast members like Karen Mason and James Barbour."

McDonald's would pay to appear at the top of the trends list on Twitter's home page, using the social-media site to drive people to its new commercials highlighting some of the real-life farmers and ranchers who supply McDonald's with its ingredients. Executives at the fast-food company loved the commercials; the word in-house was ''authenticity.'' The spots, which were rolled out in January, transported viewers to down-home places like Warden, Wash., and Astoria, Ill., where gritty men wearing denim knelt in the soil or rode horses while talking about the sacrifices they made for the harvest or the herd and dispensing nuggets of plain-spoken wisdom about their worthy jobs. ''Beef's what we do,'' one supplier said. ''Good potato,'' said another, examining a dirt-encrusted spud destined to end up as an order of French fries.

Father of five and grandfather of nine, he loved his family and they adored him. Arthur was a legendary litigator and dealmaker until the end. His storied career and bold life was filled with laughter and love. Born to Lou and Pearl Lieberman on September 6, 1935, he attended Stuyvesant High School, graduating at 16 years old to attend Cornell University where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity. After transferring to New York University, Arthur graduated with honors in electrical engineering. Soon after graduation, he married the former Doris Greenberg, joined the US Air Force and was stationed at Westover Air Force base in Massachusetts. He retired a Captain. Arthur returned to New York where he worked for ITT, attended Brooklyn Law School at night and had three children with Doris who he was married to for 18 years. Upon graduation, he joined the law firm Hopgood Calimafde, practicing intellectual property law which became his hallmark. Making partner in four years, he was a licensing expert and patent litigator, appearing before many federal and state trial and appellate courts. Arthur then founded his own successful intellectual property firm, Lieberman & Nowak. A larger than life character in his own right, Arthur was best known for his dealings in the world of heroes. Arthur brought together warring factions to unite the Robert E. Howard library of characters and create Conan the Barbarian and Red Sonja movies. He parlayed that success into his partnership with comic book legend Stan Lee and Gil Champion in POW Entertainment. As much as he loved the ""art"" of the deal, he loved his family more. The foundation of his family life for over 30 years was his marriage to his beloved former Beverly Trogdon with whom he had two children. Together, they built homes in Connecticut, Florida but neither more spectacular than a lakeside ranch in Montana where he finally found a place as big as he was. Beverly passed away five years ago, also from cancer. Arthur will be missed by his family of 20: his sister Mimi Shapiro of Fort Myers, Florida; his son Mark Lieberman of New York and wife Ann Marie and children Jake, Alex and Rena; daughter Shari Balaish of New York and husband Amos and children Timor, Ori and Maytal; son Mitch Lieberman of Vermont and his wife Bethany and children Andrew, Noah and Emma; son and business partner Luke Lieberman of California and wife Shannon; and youngest daughter Samantha Steinkamp of California and husband Jeff, whose wedding Arthur was determined to attend; walking Samantha down the aisle only three weeks ago was his last act of courage in what was the last of many family gatherings with Arthur atop the head table ... but many more to come in his honor and wish ... One Family. The family will be holding a memorial service in New York on Sunday and accepting visitors Sunday-Tuesday. Contact 212-796-0351 for details. Donations in Arthur's memory can be made to Bonner Lung Cancer Research Fund, The James Cancer Hospital, Ohio State University, Attn Steve Chaykowski, 660 Ackerman Road Room 651, P.O.

On the album, Electric Guest is the project of Mr. Taccone, its singer and keyboardist; Matthew Compton, its guitarist, bassist and drummer; and their producing and songwriting collaborator in the studio, Brian Burton (a k a Danger Mouse). Only future Electric Guest releases will reveal how much or how little Mr. Burton shaped this album. The music shares quite a bit with other Danger Mouse projects like Broken Bells and Gnarls Barkley: analog-sounding keyboards, quasi-vintage bass and guitar tones, and a fondness for the way 1960s rock and soul were distilled by new wave rock."

Even taking into account that unusually warm winter weather probably distorted the recent results, the underlying trend shows an economy that has been creating about 175,000 jobs a month -- enough to keep the recovery crawling along, but too weak to appreciably raise hiring or wages. Nor is it clear where more growth will come from. Manufacturing picked up last month, but activity in the larger service sector slowed. Recent auto sales were up, and home sales have been slowly, if fitfully, improving, but home prices continue to fall. Consumer spending, in general, rose in the first quarter, but it appears to be driven by people who are profiting from a rising stock market. Increased market volatility, like Friday's 168-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, would make them nervous and less inclined to spend."
2012-05-04T00:00:00Z,"PARIS -- French prosecutors are seeking to widen an investigation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former chief of the International Monetary Fund, to look into accusations that he sexually assaulted a woman at a hotel in Washington in 2010, the prosecutor's office in the northern city of Lille said on Friday. The prosecutor's office said investigators had formally requested to expand the inquiry, which has already resulted in charges in March against Mr. Strauss-Kahn of ''aggravated procurement in an organized gang,'' the legal term for pimping, over a prostitution ring centered in Lille."
2012-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Two former executives at Rupert Murdoch's British tabloid newspapers, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, pivotal figures in the phone hacking scandal with strong links to Prime Minister David Cameron, will give evidence to a public inquiry next week, according to schedules released Thursday. Mr. Coulson, who resigned as the editor of the tabloid The News of the World, which was at the center of the scandal in 2007, became a senior adviser to Mr. Cameron before being forced to step down last year. He has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy in the hacking case and of corruption in approving payments from journalists to public officials. Ms. Brooks, who was chief executive of Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper company News International, also has close ties to Mr. Cameron. She has been arrested on the same grounds as Mr. Coulson and on suspicion of obstructing justice. The appearances are likely to deepen scrutiny of the links -- described by critics as improperly cozy -- between Mr. Murdoch's media empire and Mr. Cameron's government. Separately, a former Scotland Yard special operations officer was arrested ''on suspicion of misconduct in a public office'' as part of Operation Elveden, the investigation into the payments to public officials, the police said. The arrest was made, the police said, as a result of information provided by Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation."

Mr. Izzard plays Long John Silver in standard pirate clothes, but purists may hate this movie as much as if he were doing the role in drag. The adaptation, written by Stewart Harcourt and directed by Steve Barron, takes liberties with Stevenson's tale that some will find unforgivable.

By the 1930s, when the urban planner/wrecker Robert Moses set up an office on the island, those unhappy institutions were gone. In the 1990s, a spiffy multipurpose sports complex took their place.

The Board of Directors, Medical Advisory Board and Staff of The Eye-Bank for Sight Restoration are extremely saddened by the sudden passing of their long-time Medical Director Chin Wing Chu, MD and extend their heartfelt condolences to his wife Gloria and son, Robbie. For the past 30 years, Dr. Chu performed the extensive duties of being the medical director of the world's first eye bank, helping to guarantee the distribution of safe, quality donor eye tissue for cornea transplants and other sight-saving ocular surgeries. Since he assumed the role in 1982, it was to The Eye-Bank's benefit and all those individuals who received the beautiful gift of sight through his tenure that he dedicated the same degree of excellence and the highest of standards to this volunteer position as he did in his professional, private practice as a highly-esteemed and prominent ophthalmologist and corneal surgeon. Nationally and internationally, he offered the same wisdom and dedication to forums on the treatment of corneal disease and the field of ophthalmology and eye banking through the Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) for which he served on the Medical Advisory Board and as Chair of the Association (1998-2000). In 2004 he received the Paton Award, the highest award bestowed on ophthalmologists by the EBAA. Five years ago, in celebration of his 25 years of dedication to the Eye-Bank for Sight Restoration, the Wing Chu Professional Education Award was founded to help continue his legacy of increasing awareness of the field of eye banking among corneal surgeons. The Eye-Bank will forever miss Wing's expertise in medicine, generosity in leadership, and large doses of wisdom and counsel. The miracle of sight restoration occurred for countless men, women and children through the years thanks to the skill and dedication of Wing Chu, M.D. With deepest sympathy, Patricia Dahl, Executive Director/CEO, Joseph J.

From 1976 until 2008, every major-party presidential candidate took public money for the general election, adhering to spending limits that significantly reduced the influence of money on American elections. Candidates began dropping out of public financing for primaries in 2000, and then in 2008, Barack Obama abandoned the system entirely, preferring to raise more money from small donations, and promising to fix the public program. He has made almost no attempt to fulfill that promise."

2012-05-05T00:00:00Z,"LIEBERMAN--Arthur M. Formerly of New York City, passed away peacefully from lung cancer in Los Angeles on May 1, 2012. Father of five and grandfather of nine, he loved his family and they adored him. Arthur was a legendary litigator and dealmaker until the end. His storied career and bold life was filled with laughter and love. Born to Lou and Pearl Lieberman on September 6, 1935, he attended Stuyvesant High School, graduating at 16 years old to attend Cornell University where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity. After transferring to New York University, Arthur graduated with honors in electrical engineering. Soon after graduation, he married the former Doris Greenberg, joined the US Air Force and was stationed at Westover Air Force base in Massachusetts. He retired a Captain. Arthur returned to New York where he worked for ITT, attended Brooklyn Law School at night and had three children with Doris who he was married to for 18 years. Upon graduation, he joined the law firm Hopgood Calimafde, practicing intellectual property law which became his hallmark. Making partner in four years, he was a licensing expert and patent litigator, appearing before many federal and state trial and appellate courts. Arthur then founded his own successful intellectual property firm, Lieberman & Nowak. A larger than life character in his own right, Arthur was best known for his dealings in the world of heroes. Arthur brought together warring factions to unite the Robert E. Howard library of characters and create Conan the Barbarian and Red Sonja movies. He parlayed that success into his partnership with comic book legend Stan Lee and Gil Champion in POW Entertainment. As much as he loved the ""art"" of the deal, he loved his family more. The foundation of his family life for over 30 years was his marriage to his beloved former Beverly Trogdon with whom he had two children. Together, they built homes in Connecticut, Florida but neither more spectacular than a lakeside ranch in Montana where he finally found a place as big as he was. Beverly passed away five years ago, also from cancer. Arthur will be missed by his family of 20: his sister Mimi Shapiro of Fort Myers, Florida; his son Mark Lieberman of New York and wife Ann Marie and children Jake, Alex and Rena; daughter Shari Balaish of New York and husband Amos and children Timor, Ori and Maytal; son Mitch Lieberman of Vermont and his wife Bethany and children Andrew, Noah and Emma; son and business partner Luke Lieberman of California and wife Shannon; and youngest daughter Samantha Steinkamp of California and husband Jeff, whose wedding Arthur was determined to attend; walking Samantha down the aisle only three weeks ago was his last act of courage in what was the last of many family gatherings with Arthur atop the head table ... but many more to come in his honor and wish ... One Family. The family will be holding a memorial service in New York on Sunday and accepting visitors Sunday-Tuesday. Contact 212-796-0351 for details. Donations in Arthur's memory can be made to Bonner Lung Cancer Research Fund, The James Cancer Hospital, Ohio State University, Attn Steve Chaykowski, 660 Ackerman Road Room 651, P.O. Box 183112, Columbus Ohio 43128."

2012-05-05T00:00:00Z,"A WEEK ago the Obama re-election campaign unveiled a slogan for the fall campaign -- its answer to Ronald Reagan's ''Morning in America,'' Bill Clinton's ''bridge to the 21st century,'' and other successful re-election pitches. There were reports that the slogan-writing process had been a struggle for the White House, and the final product bore those rumors out. ''Forward,'' the Obama campaign will be declaiming to Americans, which feels like a none-too-subtle admission that a look backward at the Obama economic record might be bad news for the president's re-election prospects. But maybe the White House doesn't need a slogan. After all, it has a person instead: a composite character who's been the talk of Washington these last few days, and whose imaginary life story casts the stakes in this presidential campaign into unusually sharp relief."

Either Bodemeister was going to give the trainer Bob Baffert, fresh off a heart attack, his fourth Kentucky Derby victory, or I'll Have Another was going to give an anonymous jockey, Mario Gutierrez, one of the most unlikely victories in the 138 runnings of America's greatest horse race. For a mile and an eighth, Bodemeister had been breathtaking. He had come to Churchill Downs as the undisputed king of speed after leading every step of the way in the Arkansas Derby. It was why bettors in a record crowd of more than 165,000 had made him the 4-1 favorite. But the colt was taking on history -- he had not raced as a 2-year-old, and the last late starter to win the Derby was Apollo in 1882."

The deal, hashed out by Representatives Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House minority whip, and Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, would increase the bank's trade financing lending limit to $140 billion over three years. That would be a 40 percent increase from the current $100 billion limit, which the bank has almost reached. It would also mandate a series of audits and reports that critics say is needed to ensure the institution is not exposing taxpayers to great risk."

I was also obsessed with chemistry and physics in high school. In 1994, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh with a bachelor's degree in biological sciences. My senior year, I got a job at the alumni relations office calling alumni for donations. I called one man with whom I had a lot in common, a doctor from Manhattan who had been a biology major.

Walking through the museum last September, the boy, Benjamin Lerman Coady, noticed that a thin slice of both southern Spain and North Africa were missing from the map and submitted a note to the Met saying so, The Hartford Courant reported. The museum subsequently acknowledged that he was absolutely right. Ms. Evans met with Benjamin and his mother, Joanne Lerman, for an hour. ''We talked about him and what he was interested in, why the map was inaccurate for the precise label but accurate,'' Ms. Evans said. ''The Byzantine Empire in this period regained territory that it has always claimed but in the preceding century had not actually controlled.''"

Some rabbits eschew millinery altogether, preferring accessories like scarves. Widely broadening our conception of what it means to have large ears and to live in a world in which the word ''hutch'' is not always preceded by the phrase ''Starsky and...,'' this talk explodes commonplace notions about large front teeth and hopping."

2012-05-05T00:00:00Z,"When blogging first exploded in the early 2000s, the great promise was that it would level the literary playing field. Unknown writers would suddenly have the reach of John Grisham or Janet Evanovich. Agents and publishers would be surfing the Web instead of sifting through the slush pile to find new talent. For the most part, though, the medium's crossover success stories have been more novelty than literary: Justin Halpern's Twitter feed-turned-quasi-memoir, ''S -- My Dad Says,'' or the erotic ''Fifty Shades'' trilogy by E. L. James, which originated as ''Twilight''-inspired fan fiction."

Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal, above), an Army helicopter pilot in Afghanistan, is sent via a software program onto a commuter train in Chicago with orders to stop a bomber from destroying it. Michelle Monaghan is Christina Warren, the pretty woman sitting opposite him, who knows and sees him as Sean (Frédérick De Grandpré), a schoolteacher. After Stevens fails to stop the bomber and the train blows up, he is returned to the dark capsule that contains him in the alternate reality -- only to be sent back repeatedly to the train with the understanding that his job is not done until the bomber has been stopped. Vera Farmiga plays Colleen Goodwin, the military officer who guides Stevens on his mission. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called the film ''a smooth diversion directed by Duncan Jones that bats around a few big ideas,'' adding that Mr. Gyllenhall ''hits the dark and light notes right, bringing subtle differences to his performance, whether Stevens is questioning reality or riding that train of life and death and angling for what everyone wants: the chance to get it right.'' 10:30 A.M.

2012-05-05T00:00:00Z,"Bennie Green A lot of the music made by the trombonist Bennie Green (1923-77) suggests that the idea of discrete aesthetic eras in jazz has been oversold. He doesn't fit easily into one. In the 1950s he played plush, sliding, unconstricted, just-on-the-edge-of-shouting trombone lines among some musicians who were otherwise concerned with getting their sound tighter and spikier. (I'm trying not to say that he confounded the perceived line between swing and bebop, but there, I said it.) His own records on Blue Note, particularly ''Soul Stirrin,' '' are beautiful, but a newly released recording of him with the young Hank Mobley's band at the Piccadilly Club in Newark, ''Hank Mobley: Newark 1953'' (Uptown Records), can help you toward a better understanding of the daily reality of jazz. It's a couple of sets on a loose and boozy Monday night. Green's the special guest with Mobley's house band, including the pianist Walter Davis Jr., the bassist Jimmy Schenck and the drummer Charli Persip, and they're playing Green's repertory: ''Embraceable You,'' a bunch of ballads, Green's own ''Blues Is Green.'' (Green was invited by the comedian Redd Foxx, who booked jazz at the club one night a week.) Perhaps there are no eras, only individuals. Green was seven years older than the Newark-based Mobley, which meant that Mobley came to musical consciousness idolizing Charlie Parker, whereas Green did not. (Green had played alongside Parker in Earl Hines's big band in 1943, before Parker had much of a reputation.) Mobley's more than fine here, modern and bluesy and effortful, but Green is on a different plane, serene, joyous. He's riding on the swing, riffing, repeating notes. You could listen to him all day, and there's two hours' worth here."

This is how Phil Mickelson punched his ticket to the World Golf Hall of Fame, through a lifetime of identifying targets and taking aim at them as if they were flags on the practice range. Mickelson, 41, who will be inducted into the Hall on Monday in St. Augustine, Fla., first crossed paths with Harry Rudolph III at Presidio Hills Golf Course when they were 6. Over the next decade, they became the two best junior golfers in the country while playing practice matches for tees and competitive rounds for hometown bragging rights."

2012-05-05T00:00:00Z,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Rosie Napravnik was a little heart broken. She wants desperately to win a Kentucky Derby, but saw those dreams delayed earlier this week when the colt she was to ride, Mark Valeski, was not fit enough for his trainer, Larry Jones, and scratched. But that was no reason to leave town; she was riding a filly named Believe You Can in the Grade I $1 million Kentucky Oaks on Friday. The filly is also trained by Jones, a hard-boot trainer who likes Believe You Can plenty. The more than 112,000 people here for the ''fillies run for the lilies'' found out why as Believe You Can turned for home with Broadway's Alibi at her throat. Napravnik and Believe You Can held off Broadway's Alibi and the recently inducted Hall of Fame rider John Velazquez in a stirring duel that lasted the length of the stretch."

And I was with them, worried I was about to spend my five precious days in paradise on a spring break-style debauch. That was until I overheard a woman with cropped blond hair and at least a few decades on the average Flyer passenger talking to a group of young Americans who appeared not quite as sunscreen-slathered or iPod-attached as the rest. ''Can you imagine if you were living on an island that had not had much contact with the western World and everyone was coming and getting drunk?'' I heard her say. ''They're not going to have the best impression of us.''"

''I know what it's like to be a winner in the playoffs -- I can finally say that,'' the second-year Knick Landry Fields said after Miami's Dwyane Wade misfired on what would have been a series-ending 3-pointer from the right corner and the Knicks broke their 11-year playoff victory drought, 89-87.

In most of these events it can seem as if Symphony Space were attempting to cram an entire voluminous world into 12 hours on a single stage, to varying if nearly always edifying effect. This year's installment, ''Wall to Wall Gertrude's Paris,'' presented on Saturday, felt different: more open, yet, paradoxically, unusually focused. To start with, the event, assembled by Laura Kaminsky, a composer and the Symphony Space artistic director, took its lead from another institution's doings: ''The Steins Collect: Matisse, Picasso and the Parisian Avant-Garde,'' a collection now on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art."

By the end of the two-and-a-half-hour show, the Kaufmann Concert Hall was half-buried in drifts of refined light verse invented eons before ''whatever,'' ''no problem,'' ''awesome'' and ''dude'' dominated everyday language. This was the first time Mr. Waldrop, a frequent behind-the-scenes director of many Lyrics & Lyricists shows, stepped to the fore; he appeared stiff and flustered. Ignoring its subjects' great love songs, the show concentrated on their wittier lyrics sung and recited by a mostly well-chosen cast accompanied by a backup quartet led by the pianist Don Rebic."
2012-05-06T00:00:00Z,"''I SING the body electric,'' Walt Whitman wrote in 1855, inspired by the novelty of useful electricity, which he would live to see power streetlights and telephones, locomotives and dynamos. In ''Leaves of Grass,'' his ecstatic epic poem of American life, he depicted himself as a live wire, a relay station for all the voices of the earth, natural or invented, human or mineral. ''I have instant conductors all over me,'' he wrote. ''They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me... My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself.'' Electricity equipped Whitman and other poets with a scintillation of metaphors. Like inspiration, it was a lightning flash. Like prophetic insight, it illuminated the darkness. Like sex, it tingled the flesh. Like life, it energized raw matter. Whitman didn't know that our cells really do generate electricity, that the heart's pacemaker relies on such signals and that billions of axons in the brain create their own electrical charge (equivalent to about a 60-watt bulb). A force of nature himself, he admired the range and raw power of electricity."

A year later, the government dropped its case against Dajaz1 and returned the site to its owner. But why? Little explanation was given at the time, and the answer is still unclear. But court documents released last week offer a window into the investigation, and reveal some of the finger-pointing between the government and the industry groups that push for copyright enforcement."
2012-05-06T00:00:00Z,"YEARS ago, realtors attempted to gussy up a gritty slice of the Western Addition area of San Francisco -- home to wig shops, greasy diners and its fair share of crime -- with a catchy acronym, NoPa, after its city-central location, north of the Panhandle. When the restaurant Nopa took over an abandoned Laundromat in 2006, the moniker started to catch on -- and it now seems to have officially stuck. Rents are rising, retail options are evolving, and the neighborhood is expanding up, down and around Divisadero Street. Check-cashing joints have become trendy salons; landscaped parklets and do-it-yourself schools have cropped up; and artisanal pies and pizza are making a Popeyes look increasingly out of place. With plans for better bike lanes, a branch of the cult-favorite grocery and ice cream shop Bi-Rite coming this fall, and a Four Barrel cafe and ''toast bar'' (called the Mill) opening soon, NoPa is poised to become the next Mission -- just leafier and more low-key.

2012-05-06T00:00:00Z,"Lawsuits over copycatting in reality television have gone nowhere in the past, but CBS has suggested to ABC that it may consider one over a summer show called ''Glass House.'' The format is similar to CBS's long-running summer series ''Big Brother,'' and ABC has hired many former production members from that show. On Friday CBS sent a sternly worded letter to ABC about it. The letter implies, without directly saying so, that CBS will sue ABC over copyright infringement. The letter said that CBS was ''putting ABC on notice that its continued development and production of 'Glass House' exposes ABC to liability.'' The letter said the elements of the new show are ''substantially and strikingly'' similar to ''Big Brother.'' In ''Glass House,'' which has its debut on June 18, 14 people are chosen to live in a house all summer with cameras on them in pursuit of a cash prize -- the essence of ''Big Brother'' competition. In the past copyright cases have proved nearly impossible for reality-show plaintiffs to win because, in simple terms, everybody's reality is inherently different. The total number of former staff members on ''Glass House'' is at least 18, according to the CBS letter, all of whom signed nondisclosure agreements when they worked for ''Big Brother.'' The CBS letter argued that it would be impossible for anyone who signed such a letter to help produce a similar show without breaching the agreement. ABC had yet to respond to the CBS letter or requests for comment by Sunday afternoon."

2012-05-06T00:00:00Z,"MORALITY in big business -- that enduring oxymoron -- is a hot cinematic topic again (for reasons too obvious and painful to mention), with movies like last year's ''Margin Call'' and the forthcoming ''Cosmopolis'' brooding over Faustian deals made by white-collar heels. The director and writer Paul Weitz, who has brought a distinctively mordant perspective to both theater (''Trust'') and film (''About a Boy''), is now tilling that territory onstage, though presumably with a lighter touch. His ''LONELY, I'M NOT,'' which opens Monday at Second Stage Theater, considers the plight of Porter, a burnt-out corporate nova trying to reignite his life. Porter is being portrayed, most auspiciously, by Topher Grace, in his professional stage debut. Mr. Grace, though best known as the endearingly awkward Eric Forman on ''That '70s Show'' on television, brought disarming charm to what might be considered a before-picture variation on Porter in Mr. Weitz's 2004 film, ''In Good Company.'' Trip Cullman here directs Mr. Grace and a cast that includes Olivia Thirlby (of the movies ''Juno'' and Mr. Weitz's ''Being Flynn'' released in March) and the invaluable Lisa Emery.

''Plenty of others have had their say about me and my art, for better or worse,'' Neiman said in an e-mail interview, perhaps alluding to critics who have dismissed as commercial his crazy-colored renderings of athletes, presidents and Playboy Bunnies. ''But until now, I've never told my own story.'' That story begins in Minnesota, where Neiman grew up tough and poor. Enough happens to him in the 1940s alone to fill a book: he spends a night in jail for brawling and ships off to basic training the next day. When G.I.'s land on Omaha Beach, the Army gives them condoms to protect their rifle muzzles; Neiman uses his to safeguard his cigars. He eventually goes AWOL in Belgium, paints murals for the Red Cross, bootlegs Cognac and loses a girlfriend to Marlene Dietrich."

2012-05-06T00:00:00Z,"The Chemex, that iconic nonelectric coffee maker, has finally met its match. The Kone filter from Able Brewing Equipment ($55 at ablebrewing.com) is a gorgeous piece of coffee gear, a stainless steel filter that fits most cone drippers, and whose precise holes (cut by a photochemical process) allow for a steady flow while minimizing sediment. The resulting best-of-both-worlds brew has the richness of French press and the clean flavor of drip. And unlike other metal filters, there's no mesh to scrub. Now in its third iteration (a bumper was added, and its holes reconfigured), the Kone is a fixture at next-generation coffee bars like Café Grumpy on Manhattan's Lower East Side and Intelligentsia Coffee and Tea in Venice, Calif. Able's founder, Keith Gehrke, a former roaster at a coffee company and a co-founder of Coava in Portland, Ore., is now working on a ceramic coffee maker. Soon, the Kone will have its match, too. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Labor has fallen out of favor in City Hall thanks to a wealthy mayor who does not depend on unions' donations or their formidable get-out-the-vote efforts, but that will change in 2013, when the race could be decided in a Democratic primary with heavy turnout from the left-leaning teachers' union, which has 200,000 active and retired members."

He is Panamanian by birth, but a New Yorker since age 4. African-American, but also of white and Latino heritage. Republican, but he voted for Barack Obama. A born-again Christian, but once a member of the Nation of Islam. He spreads the Gospel, but is close with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is Jewish, and speaks with him roughly every other week. ''We clicked,'' Mr. Bernard said. Mr. Bernard, 59, is an adept political force in New York City, a preacher who would rather guide public policy behind the scenes than shout about it in front of the cameras. His discretion and his willingness to work with people with whom he disagrees on some matters -- like, he said, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker who is a lesbian -- have made him a moderate in the evangelical Christian world, and a sought-after bridge between liberal politicians and more conservative constituencies.

Their task was formidable: devise a modern guide to replace the old map, designed by Massimo Vignelli in 1972 with an artist's touch but a less-than-faithful adherence to the city's true geography."
2012-05-06T00:00:00Z,"One way to look at ballet is to concentrate on the choreography; and in this respect New York City Ballet has unmatched wealth in terms of both quantity and quality. Its spring season, which began on Tuesday, brought 12 ballets into repertory by Saturday night, going all the way back to 1934 (George Balanchine's ''Serenade''), and up to 2006 (Christopher Wheeldon's ''DGV: Danse à Grande Vitesse''). Next week's additions include two world premieres. This abundance, phenomenal elsewhere, is ordinary at City Ballet. There are other ways to take in ballet, though: for example, by concentrating on dancers, on dancing (not necessarily the same thing), on history and on music. Wednesday night's performance began with one of the company's rightly popular See the Music talks, in which the conductor Andrews Sill spoke of Tchaikovsky's ''Serenade for Strings'' and of Balanchine's structural reordering of it in ''Serenade.'' (The third movement is played after the fourth.) He also paid a touching personal tribute to the conductor Hugo Fiorato, who died last month. For decades Mr. Fiorato was a constant part of City Ballet's existence and gave many performances a particular warmth."

MillerCoors hired WPP to form a team of agencies in Chicago to handle the creative tasks for Coors brands and named Saatchi & Saatchi, New York, part of Publicis, to create campaigns for Miller Lite beer. Digitas, another Publicis unit, will continue to create digital ads for Miller Lite and also handle its digital media account. There were other changes as well, affecting tasks like media planning. DraftFCB had recently shared creative duties on Miller Lite with Saatchi & Saatchi and traced its ties to Coors to the work a predecessor, Foote Cone & Belding, began creating for Coors in 1979. DraftFCB said it would continue to work for MillerCoors in Canada and handle Coors in some overseas markets.

2012-05-06T00:00:00Z,"WE tend to think of the alphabet as just a tool, a 26-piece kit we use to learn, to conduct business and, perhaps, to fall in love. But letters are much more than that. Each one bears a certain talismanic power. In the same way that each element has an atomic weight, each letter carries an emotional charge. Think of the quirkiness of the letter Q, the sinuousness of S, the zip of Z. That perception is one of the foundations of the exhibition ''ECSTATIC ALPHABETS/HEAPS OF LANGUAGE,'' which opens Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art. ''Ecstatic Alphabets'' gathers 12 contemporary artists and artist groups that work in all mediums, including painting, sculpture, film, video, audio and design. And each of these artists -- including Tauba Auerbach, Dexter Sinister (David Reinfurt and Stuart Bailey) and Trisha Donnelly -- obsess over the physicality of letters in all five senses as they explore the relationship between art and language. The show also has a brief timeline of language in modern art, including works by Carl Andre, Marcel Duchamp and Bruce Nauman.

Striking one would help an athlete vent frustration without inflicting collateral damage."

The result: wooden carpet. Sounds simple, but each rug is made of hundreds of individually sanded and oiled pieces of wood veneer that are cut and attached by hand to a textile base. The carpets, which are now produced and distributed by the German furniture manufacturer Böwer, generated so much interest in Strozyk that she skipped the usual apprenticeships and set up her own studio. She calls her work ''the never-ending experiment.'' Stay tuned. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Answers never come in ''The Caretaker,'' Harold Pinter's classic 1960 play about the peculiar relations among a tramp and two brothers in a cluttered room in a dilapidated London house. But like many other unanswered questions in Pinter plays, the old man's plea takes on a weird, terrible urgency. Acrid comedy has suddenly curdled into something closer to tragedy, and you can't really put your finger on exactly when or precisely why."

She died peacefully in Durham, North Carolina on April 16, 2012. Renee loved to laugh; she did it easily, often at herself. She was inquisitive, engaged, and concerned. She adored words, whether spoken from a stage or written on a page. She was as smart as they get. She was honest, ethical, and kind; passionate, opinionated, and ridiculously articulate. She used it all to right whatever wrongs she encountered: if there was hunger, it would be fed; if there was hurt, it would be healed; if there was injustice, it would be made right. Renee changed people's lives. She will be missed by the many who knew her, and many more who didn't. Renee's son Jeff died in 2007. Her daughter Jennifer lives in Durham. A tribute to Renee will be held this fall in Durham, NC.

Throughout the arraignment, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and the other four defendants refused to talk to, or even listen to, the judge.

Choreographers tend to move from one new piece to another, without the resources to maintain or revisit older works. So it's particularly noteworthy that JOHN JASPERSE -- quite possibly the most important American contemporary dance choreographer of his generation -- is presenting an expanded and revised version of his 2000 ''Fort Blossom,'' which Anna Kisselgoff described then in The New York Times as ''an uninhibited search for a new direction, not yet defined.'' If you are already a fan of Mr. Jasperse's meticulous, ever-surprising work, it should be fascinating to see if ''Fort Blossom revisited'' prefigured his choreographic evolution over this last decade. If you are new to the work, it should be a great place to start. 7:30 p.m. Wednesday to Saturday, New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $15-$30."

Since opening her New York studio in 2006, she's become known primarily for her Bubble Series chandelier, an industrially-inspired brass armature blooming with charmingly lumpy blown glass globes. It consistently tops the shopping lists of architects and designers like Peter Marino and Kelly Wearstler; a sheik in Kuwait has one, and Ivanka Trump has two in her new Park Avenue apartment. ''It's almost like hanging a tree branch from your ceiling,'' Adelman says, who, as a design student at the Rhode Island School of Design, also dabbled in sculpture. In her new work, however, you get the sense that nature has gone wild and completely taken over. Drippy glass stalactites are entwined in cobweb-like snarls of knotted rope. Thorny cast brass and horsehair stoppers pierce the tops of small glass vessels, while individual brass barbs screw directly into the wall in ominous clusters. In the fall, Adelman will introduce a line of hand-drawn wallpaper with Anthropologie, for which she turned the contents of her junk drawer (hair balls, X-Acto blades) into a densely baroque floral pattern inspired by English and Moorish ornamentation. And the bronze and wood candlesticks she showed last month at the Milan furniture fair emulate fungus growing on the dark side of a log.

He met the love of his life, Theodora (Teddy), while she was working in a research lab there. They married in 1941 and soon after, he joined the Navy and was sent oversees as a medical officer with the Marines. He was with the landing party at Guadalcanal and was involved in numerous battles in the South Pacific. When he returned in 1945, they moved to Boston where he completed a chief residency at the Beth Israel Hospital and pursued research in hematology. From 1947 to 1961, he was a faculty member involved in teaching, patient care, and research at both Harvard and Tufts Medical Schools, while Teddy was active in progressive politics. In 1961, Bob took a position as Professor of Medicine at New York Medical College and the founding chief of the division of hematology. He served as Chairman of the Department of Medicine from 1969 until 1976 when he became Associate Dean of Student Affairs until he retired in 1985. He was much loved by his students who dedicated their yearbook to him in five of the ten years he served in that role.

Fifteen months after the generals seized power at the ouster of Hosni Mubarak, how much they now submit for the first time to civilian authority will determine whether last year's uprising lives up to its billing as a democratic revolution or amounts instead to a coup. It is among the most consequential questions for Egypt's allies, like the United States and Israel, and for the next Egyptian president."

That voice belongs to Charlotte (the superb Juliet Stevenson), who, with her former roommates, has been summoned to the place where one of their own has died.

At the edge of the forest we discover a writhing, pulsing mass of honey bees hanging off a white mulberry tree branch - a so-called swarm cluster.

Winning would make him the representative of a heavily black district in a borough where blacks are the largest reliably Democratic ethnic group, and would give him a grip on federal dollars for housing and jobs. Mr. Jeffries, 41, a former lawyer at the Paul Weiss firm, is politically moderate and untouched by scandal, and can talk to the gentrifiers in Clinton Hill and Fort Greene and to the Hasidim in Crown Heights. ''He has the potential to swing a much larger bat in the power game than any of the black leaders in Brooklyn,'' said Norman Adler, a Democratic political consultant. In the State Assembly, Mr. Jeffries sponsored a bill, passed in 2010, that prohibited the police from collecting data on people stopped and frisked but not charged with a crime, a major issue for minority voters. He lives in Prospect Heights with his wife and two sons, and he may have higher political ambitions, judging by his observation in an interview that the city's black power center had shifted from Harlem. ''This is an opportunity for a new generation of African-American leaders to emerge who can advance the interests of our community but appeal to a broader group of individuals,'' he said.

Three years into his tenure as Judge Kaye's successor, Judge Lippman, 66, has used that savvy to become, in the eyes of many, a bigger player than she was outside the courtroom on policy, budgetary, administrative and legislative issues. Some judges and lawyers fear Judge Lippman because he knows the administrative machinery that court officials can use to punish and reward. New York's liberal establishment has been largely neutralized as a source of criticism because he has staked out a progressive role, not only in individual cases, but also on causes like increasing state financing for lawyers who represent poor people.

It is a warning from the front-runner, a two-term independent governor who, because he refuses to say whom he would support for majority leader next year, may well decide which party controls an evenly divided Senate."
2012-05-06T00:00:00Z,"''I used to be really scared of this area,'' says the artist Francis Upritchard of London's Hackney district, where she and the furniture designer Martino Gamper share a charmingly quirky three-story apartment in a public housing project - what the British call a council flat. ''When I went with the estate agent, there were eight students living there and it was filthy,'' she recalls of the flat, which she bought six years ago. ''The living room was two different rooms.'' Like the neighborhood, which has recently blossomed with hip hangouts like Broadway Market and London Fields, the house transformed slowly. With the help of her brother Rob and her sister Hannah, Upritchard ripped out everything that was possible to rip out. Two years later, when Gamper, then her boyfriend, moved in (the couple married in 2009), things really started to take shape. ''Before Martino moved in, the flat just had furniture from the street,'' Upritchard says, ''so it was quite a relief to have help in that department.''"

They walked through a shiny corridor where D.J.'s blasted Ricky Martin and reggaeton music, past a boisterous chef shimmying and shaking his hips as he cooked, and past a gaggle of teenage girls posing in their quinceañera dresses. Only then, around a cafeteria corner and comfortably out of view from the piña colada station, would visitors at this year's Latino Expo be greeted by the unexpected: two uniformed men sitting beneath a blue banner emblazoned with ''East Haven Police'' in large yellow letters. Nearby, the town's mayor, Joseph Maturo Jr., bounced among vendors, a blue plastic lei dangling from his neck."

2012-05-06T00:00:00Z,"Hawaii significantly strengthened its protections against child sexual abuse last month when Gov. Neil Abercrombie signed a measure extending the statute of limitations for civil lawsuits filed by child victims. At least as important, it opens a one-time two-year window to allow victims to file suits against their abusers even if the time limit had expired under the old law. Like similar laws in California and Delaware, the Hawaii measure recognizes some wrenching realities. It can take many years, even decades, before child abuse victims are emotionally ready to come forward and tell their stories in court. But by then, they may be barred from suing by the statute of limitations. For example, many suits against the Catholic Church have been blocked because the church's covering up for pedophile priests made it hard for victims to come forward until long past the time limit for bringing civil claims."

Two decades later, musicians like MikeQ of Newark, Le1f of Manhattan and Zebra Katz of Queens have put a hip-hop spin on ballroom sounds and slang, while respecting tradition. On a recent Saturday night, as MikeQ D.J.'d, sequin-masked queens, tomboyish banjis and elder ''legends'' packed a banquet hall in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, for the 19th annual Ball Awards.

But he was still amused when his followers found out about his latest book and flooded his inbox with attempts ''to top each other in doing things uglier.'' ''Pretty Ugly,'' out next month in the United States from Gestalten, is his and Asensio's survey of ''new ugly,'' a groundbreaking graphics, art and design movement exemplified by Mike Meiré's 2007 restyling of 032c magazine, which features wonky stretched type and other taboo techniques. The irony of this purposefully amateurish style (as in Aldo Lanzini's crocheted mask, above) which has become influential in contemporary design, is implicit in the book's title. ''You can do something pointless or boring,'' Lorenz says, ''but it's really hard to make something ugly these days. There are no rules to break anymore - they've all been broken.''

While depression is no picnic, it is part of the richness that encompasses the human condition, something we seem to be forgetting in this nation obsessed with happiness. I'm not advocating that people who are suffering should continue to do so. I am merely suggesting that the cure be as complex as the disease. Prescribing a pill, and nothing else, to people who question their existence is unlikely to heal them of their overwhelming sorrow. BB,"

In December 2009, the program took aim at a much-publicized anticorruption campaign in the metropolis of Chongqing, a crusade that had grabbed national attention for its sweep, but raised deep concerns about its brutality and disregard for the law. What followed was an object lesson in how Bo Xilai, the campaign's architect and the secretary of Chongqing's Communist Party at the time, dealt with those who stood in his way."

Her husband, Jon Rosen, who owns the digital post-production company Nucleus Imaging, spent his childhood summers in Amagansett, N.Y., and has an almost Proustian attachment to the area. So when it came to finding a house there, Laakkonen insisted that it be a true country house. Or as she puts it, ''I'm not a horsy person, but I like the idea of it.'' Rosen had no objections. ''I had always dreamed of a compound of farm buildings,'' he says, citing in particular the former De Menil property on Further Lane in East Hampton, a cluster of more than a dozen restored 18th- and 19th-century houses and barns. The mid-20th-century house they bought, in a pocket of Amagansett surrounded largely by working farms, had in fact been modeled on a potato barn, but it was in such a state of neglect that the only bits worth salvaging were some lumber and patio stones. Not that it stood a chance anyway. ''We knew kind of what we wanted,'' Laakkonen says, and then corrects herself. ''We knew exactly what we wanted.''"

Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, talks about how essential it is to modernize the theatrical elements of opera. But few recent Met productions are bolder or fresher than Dexter's staging of this great Britten work. The performance benefited from the inspired conducting of David Robertson and from a strong cast headed by the baritone Nathan Gunn, taking on the title role for the first time at the Met. He has sung it to acclaim elsewhere, including the Lyric Opera of Chicago, in an arresting 2001 production by David McVicar."

2012-05-06T00:00:00Z,"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it, the philosopher George Santayana wrote in a piquant turn of phrase often misappropriated or mangled. Confronted with a program of works by the young German composer Jörg Widmann, like the one presented at Zankel Hall on Thursday evening as part of Carnegie Hall's Making Music series, you could elaborate on the concept: Those who can remember the past are welcome to make merry with it. Mr. Widmann, who is 38 and could easily pass for younger, is one of Europe's most celebrated clarinetists and composers, with a remarkable canon of significant works to support that reputation. Prefacing an onstage conversation with Mr. Widmann during the concert, Jeremy Geffen, Carnegie Hall's director of artistic planning, reeled off a partial list of Mr. Widmann's major pieces: among them, two operas, with a third in progress, and numerous orchestral works, including one, ''Teufel Amor,'' recently introduced and toured by the Vienna Philharmonic."

Dickey was three outs from a shutout, but he had to settle for his fourth victory of the season when Manager Terry Collins removed him after he allowed a run-scoring double in the ninth. ''It leaves a sour taste in my mouth simply because I knew I have an expectation of myself in that situation, and that is not it,'' Dickey said Sunday after the Mets' 3-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.

''Wednesday always had an octopus painted on the end of her bed,'' says the skateboarder turned photographer turned chandelier maker. ''That was pretty much the inspiration for the octopus chandeliers.'' Those chandeliers, which he originally designed for his ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea''-themed living room, mix baroque styling with creepily realistic details like suction-cup-lined arms. The fixtures, handmade with epoxy clay or cast in plaster, have evolved to incorporate vintage squeaky toys and Hello Kitty heads, and will be on view this month in ''Shiny Monsters'' at the Philadelphia Art Alliance. ''I like to do a mix of goofy and elegant,'' Wallacavage says. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Most live in the shadows of society, trying to avoid the kind of scrutiny that might lead to their deportation. But some illegal immigrants have cast off their anonymity: the Dream activists. The name comes from proposed federal legislation known as the Dream Act, which would create a path to legal status for young illegal immigrants who go to college or serve in the military. The legislation has surfaced in various forms over the past decade and has been repeatedly defeated, but some states have passed or, like New York, are considering versions that would make young illegal immigrants eligible for financial aid at public colleges and universities."

''Alex Katz: Maine / New York'' (Charta, $45) evokes the painter's natural habitats, contrasting blacked-out cityscapes with languid nature tableaus (above, center). The book is tied to an exhibition that opens in July at the Colby College Museum of Art in Waterville, Me. (More of Katz's work, his prints, are on view at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.) Following volumes on olives and Champagne, the ''Edible Series'' goes on a springtime spree with ''Vodka,'' ''Rum'' and ''Gin'' (Reaktion Books, $17 each).

(And laugh all you want, but since 2000, two years before Mr. Bloomberg took office, the life expectancy for New Yorkers at birth has risen by nearly three years, compared with about 1.5 years nationwide.) At meetings, Dr. Farley said, his staff is often approached by health officials from other places, ''and they'll say, 'What's the next big idea?' ''"

His colorful lifestyle cost him votes on the right, and his pandering to the immigrant bashers cost him votes on the left. But the overwhelming reason for his loss in Sunday's election was voters' resentment at the painful, counterproductive austerity policies crafted by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and warmly endorsed by Mr. Sarkozy as the antidote to Europe's financial crises. François Hollande, the unpreposessing Socialist candidate who won a narrow victory, instead called for channeling the government's spending and taxing powers toward recovery and economic growth."
2012-05-07T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN -- In the volatile aftermath of raucous elections, which nearly destroyed the political establishment in Greece and ended 17 years of conservative reign in France, the emphasis across Europe, even in the austerity heartland of Germany, has shifted to the very real problem of growth for the stagnant Continent. But there are few ready answers for how to turn around recessionary economies during a major sovereign debt crisis, and it will take weeks of contentious wrangling to determine whether the Germans can be pressed to make more than cosmetic changes to their focus on fiscal discipline for all."

Shippers complain that a load of freight can make its way from Los Angeles to Chicago in 48 hours, then take 30 hours to travel across the city. A recent trainload of sulfur took some 27 hours to pass through Chicago -- an average speed of 1.13 miles per hour, or about a quarter the pace of many electric wheelchairs."
2012-05-07T00:00:00Z,"Emily Bergl is the very model of a modern gal in too much of a hurry to play by the rules and waste her energy making nice for the sake of good manners. At any time of the day you can see variations of her stage character clacking noisily along Manhattan sidewalks, oblivious to her surroundings, a cellphone glued to her ear. If she's pushing a stroller, you'd better get out of the way. At last week's opening-night performance of her saucy new show, ''NY I Love You,'' in the Café Carlyle, Ms. Bergl strutted to the stage in white tie and tails and fishnet stockings. Her insinuating gaze flashed the mischief and challenge of a woman signaling that she might be too hot to handle. That image was matched be her sassy, tough-cookie voice, a theatrically savvy variation on the assertive whine of today's one-name pop divas. She was accompanied by a quartet led by her pianist, Jonathan Mastro."
2012-05-07T00:00:00Z,"The state must deliver a man accused of murder to federal authorities, a federal appeals court in Boston ruled Monday. Gov. Lincoln Chafee refused to surrender the inmate, Jason W. Pleau, in June 2011, when prosecutors wanted to try him in federal court. Mr. Chafee argued that doing so could expose Mr. Pleau to the death penalty, which Rhode Island does not have. Mr. Pleau is accused of robbing and killing a gas-station manager in 2010. Mr. Chafee has not said whether he will appeal the ruling."
2012-05-07T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO -- The sound of snoring in the audience preceded the drumbeat of footsteps onstage at a recent performance of ''The March,'' Frank Galati's studious but lifeless stage adaptation at the Steppenwold Theater here of the E. L. Doctorow novel about Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's victorious sweep through Georgia and the Carolinas during the latter days of the Civil War. The unmistakable wheeze of a sleeping patron is not unheard of at the theater, certainly, but never before have I felt envious of the fellow drifting off to dreamland. Mr. Doctorow's 2005 book, a winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award and a finalist for two of the biggest trophies of the literary world -- the Pulitzer and the National Book Award -- is a marvelous achievement, a historical novel that favors intimate detail over muscular narrative. Through the experience of a dozen or so central characters Mr. Doctorow brings alive the chaos and waste and even some of the glory of the Civil War, but also the vagaries of chance and the idiosyncrasies of character that allow some to thrive in the charnel house of battle while others are defeated or destroyed."

Rangel, was endorsed on Monday by one of the city's most prominent Hispanic leaders, Fernando Ferrer. Mr. Espaillat is the most prominent of several Democratic challengers to Mr. Rangel, a veteran Harlem congressman whose bid for re-election has been complicated this year by redistricting, which transformed the area, long a center of black political power, into a district with a Hispanic majority. Mr. Espaillat is Dominican-American and would be the first Dominican-born person to serve in Congress; the district now includes part of the Bronx and is known as the 13th Congressional District."
2012-05-07T00:00:00Z,"Late last year, fishermen began finding dead dolphins, hundreds of them, washed up on Peru's northern coast. Now, seabirds have begun dying, too, and the government has yet to conclusively pinpoint a cause. Officials insist that the two die-offs are unrelated. The dolphins are succumbing to a virus, they suggest, and the seabirds are dying of starvation because anchovies are in short supply."
2012-05-07T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA -- Jordany Valdespin stood by his locker in the visitors' clubhouse at Citizens Bank Park, cleaning shaving cream out of his ear and soaking in the beer that his teammates sprayed on him in celebration.

Mirroring the trend in elections in France and Greece, voters here expressed their anger on Sunday against the governing party by turning to nationalist and populist leaders once allied with Mr. Milosevic, who as president plunged Yugoslavia into war and more than two decades of international isolation, and died in 2006 while on trial for war crimes ."

After graduation from the University of Tennessee with a degree in business administration, his business career included time spent as a chemical firm executive, cut flower importer, manufacturer's representative in the textile and textile chemical industries, and finally as a luxury sales executive. He joined Cartier North America in 1996 and climbed his way to the top becoming a member of the Executive Committee. His drive and expertise went beyond the realm of his direct responsibilities. He contributed to the success of Cartier in the U.S. and was a mentor to many. His drive for excellence and passion for the House of Cartier influenced everyone who worked with or met him. Gatins was a former President of the American Watch Association, instrumental in the Jewelry Information Center Gem Awards and a member of the prestigious 24 Karat Club of New York City. As a highly respected leader within the luxury industry, he was a member of all prominent jewelry associations in New York. Beyond his professional life, Gatins was a dedicated philanthropist. As the chairman of the advisory committee of the Katherine John Murphy Foundation, he dedicated himself to numerous charitable organizations. He was a trustee of the EARTH University Foundation, a former board member of Piedmont Hospital Foundation, The High Museum of Art, The Latin American Association, and The Donnellan School, to name a few.

Ms. Merkel's remarks at a news conference in Berlin came as the victorious, socialist François Hollande prepared to succeed Nicolas Sarkozy as president of France.

At the White House Correspondents' Association dinner last month, President Obama playfully referenced a passage in his memoir in which he told of eating dog meat as a child in Indonesia. Riffing on Sarah Palin's line -- and responding to Republican criticism -- he said, ''What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? A pit bull is delicious.'' (Of course, Republicans have had their own canine issues, given Mitt Romney's predilection for fastening his Irish setter to the top of the family car in the 1980s.) Although dog-eating is taboo in the United States, personal consumption of dog meat is legal in most states. Likewise, Americans find horse-eating offensive; a five-year federal ban on slaughtering horses for human consumption was lifted last year. (Chicken-fried horse steak with onion gravy was on the menu at the Harvard Faculty Club until 1985.) Horse meat is consumed in France, just as dog meat is eaten in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Tonga, parts of Asia and even Switzerland. In Poland, some ingest dog fat as a curative. The status of dog meat as a hard-luck food is also well documented -- Germans during the two world wars referred to it as ''blockade mutton.''"

And it will be clearer than ever: on this issue, the president isn't leading. He's following. And the gap by which he trails others in his party grows broader and sadder."

The class is part of the Yale Baroque Opera Project, which Ms. Rosand founded five years ago with funds from the Mellon Foundation. Though the project offers specialized classes in continuo realization and such, its focus has been staged productions of operas featuring casts of undergraduates accompanied by period ensembles of faculty, student and guest players. The first complete opera was Monteverdi's ''Orfeo,'' which got things going in 2008. Since then rarities by Cavalli and Sacrati and a Handel pastiche have been staged."

It's an emblematic passage in this dance, created in the year of its title and seen at the Théâtre de la Ville here on Friday night. It also symbolizes a vital element of all Bausch's work: the moment when representation becomes reality, when the ideas of the signifier and the signified collapse. That realism is an essential part of Bausch's power as a creator and it permeates her oeuvre down to the most seemingly minor occurrences. When, later in ''1980,'' water is squirted into the faces of a line of women onstage who appear to be taking part in some sort of competition, their reactions are instinctive, and we understand something of each personality through the subsequent scream, squeal or glare."

Pfizer has identified the drug, known as tofacitinib, as one of the most promising and lucrative prospects in its drug pipeline. The company is struggling to regain lost sales after its best-selling cholesterol drug, Lipitor, lost patent protection last fall."
2012-05-07T00:00:00Z,"Ah, spring, when even a misanthrope's fancy turns to thoughts of love, or at least the vicarious experience of it. Seriously, don't you feel in the mood for a romantic comedy right about now -- one that isn't too sappy on the one hand, or too snarky on the other? Traditionally we look to the multiplexes to provide us with that fix. But this season you might want to check out what the New York theater has to offer in grown-up love stories. There's ''Once,'' of course, the multi-Tony Award nominee on Broadway, about young Dubliners making music as a substitute for love. But more urgently, through May 27 only, there's Paul Weitz's ''Lonely, I'm Not,'' which opened on Monday night at the Second Stage Theater, in a production starring a wonderfully matched, mismatched Topher Grace and Olivia Thirlby."

Mr. Kaminsky's manifesto makes the not-altogether-depressing argument that some of us might be able to tame our gluttonous appetites (and maybe even slim down) by focusing on eating foods that deliver maximum flavor."

How about a hotel that's part of a chain where you have a ton of loyalty points and they treat you like family, rather than one across town that your company wants you to use? If you said yes, you may be a candidate for going rogue. That's the term some managers use to describe business travelers who book out of policy. In other words, these travelers do not follow the rules that have been carefully negotiated with suppliers on which airlines, hotels and other travel services to use."

But what the company does not have is many customers. Several staff members sat around the company's booth on Friday, the last full day of the fair, and complained that their exports to Europe and the United States had dropped 20 percent over the last year and were likely to stay weak after few orders materialized at the fair."
2012-05-07T00:00:00Z,"Yankees outfielder Nick Swisher likes to call Tampa Bay Rays Manager Joe Maddon ''the mad scientist,'' and with good reason. When the two teams met, in St. Petersburg, Fla., on the opening weekend of the regular season, the Rays' fielders moved to the left and to the right and straight into the Yankees' heads. ''First, second, third game of the season, just leave spring training, you hit a couple of rockets and next thing you know, they're right at somebody,'' Swisher said last week, recalling how the Rays' aggressively positioned defenses made it seem as if they had 15 players on the field instead of 9."

2012-05-07T00:00:00Z,"Every so often, candidates running for high office say what they really think about an important issue. It's virtually always a problem, especially if that candidate is a vice president and what he thinks differs from his president. On Sunday, Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. said he was ''absolutely comfortable'' with same-sex marriage and portrayed the freedom to marry as a fundamental civil right. It was an important statement of support for marriage equality, and it was a big step forward from the endlessly frustrating hedging of President Obama. It should make it harder for Mr. Obama to cling to the tired evasion that his views on marriage are ''evolving.''"

The hostage, Warren Weinstein, a 70-year-old development consultant who was kidnapped in the eastern city of Lahore in August, appeared in the video released on the Internet. Wearing traditional Pakistani clothes, he appealed to Mr. Obama to bow to his captors' demands."

2012-05-07T00:00:00Z,"The United States on Monday injected a note of caution into the mood of optimism surrounding recently revived talks on Iran's contentious uranium enrichment program, calling on the Iranians to take ''urgent, practical steps'' to prove their sincerity in complying with obligations on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. The European Union was more direct, asking Iran to suspend the enrichment, a step that Iran has said it will never take. The American and European statements, made at an international nonproliferation conference in Vienna, may have reflected diplomatic posturing two weeks before the next planned round of negotiations with Iran on the uranium enrichment dispute, to be convened in Baghdad. But the statements also seemed to suggest that the atmosphere of good will in seeking to resolve the dispute diplomatically may have begun to fade."
2012-05-07T00:00:00Z,"PARIS -- The victory of François Hollande in presidential elections, the first by a Socialist in 17 years, has thrown the French right into turmoil and opened fresh opportunities for a Socialist triumph in legislative elections in June, with all the potential for a continued redrawing of France's political landscape. Mr. Hollande's victory has presented the French center-right with its most painful dilemma in a generation, particularly following the strong showing of the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in first-round voting. President Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement must now decide whether it makes a deal with Ms. Le Pen's National Front to try to limit a Socialist landslide, or reject its extremist positions to preserve the soul of the party, at the risk of weakening its own ranks."

Thousands of them once roamed the length of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the likely descendants from mounts that belonged to Spanish explorers five centuries ago.

In most of these events it can seem as if Symphony Space were attempting to cram an entire voluminous world into 12 hours on a single stage, to varying if nearly always edifying effect. This year's installment, ''Wall to Wall Gertrude's Paris,'' presented on Saturday, felt different: more open, yet, paradoxically, unusually focused. To start with, the event, assembled by Laura Kaminsky, a composer and the Symphony Space artistic director, took its lead from another institution's doings: ''The Steins Collect: Matisse, Picasso and the Parisian Avant-Garde,'' a collection now on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art."

Her grandfather bought the land, in northeast Texas, about a two-hour drive from Dallas and a quarter mile from the Oklahoma border, in 1948 and started growing wheat, corn and soy. Since then, pipeline companies have tried to lease rights to cross it many times. The Crawfords always managed to persuade them to find a way around their property."

The golden-haired Ms. Hilty -- killer heels accentuating her natural curvaceousness -- is playing a role made famous on Broadway by Carol Channing and immortalized on film by Marilyn Monroe, the very actress that Ms. Hilty's TV character, Ivy, is hoping to play in the make-believe musical dramatized on ''Smash.''"

But the sale will not be just another gathering of high-dollar photography collectors. The money raised from the prints, all donated, will go to form a fund to support the three children of Anton Hammerl, a South African photographer who was killed last year in Libya while covering the uprising against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Mr. Hammerl, 41, a former pictures editor and chief photographer for The Saturday Star in Johannesburg, had gone to cover the fighting in March 2011 as a freelancer. He went missing in early April. After several weeks of conflicting accounts provided by the Libyan government that led his family to believe he was alive, word came from two other journalists who had been held captive that Mr. Hammerl had been shot in the stomach by forces loyal to Qaddafi, and had died from his wounds in a remote desert location where he had been covering the conflict. His remains have still not been located. He was survived by his wife, Penny Sukhraj, and three children - Aurora, 11; Neo, 8; and Hiro, who was born just before Mr. Hammerl died."

A few months later, through Helen again, I met Julia Child, who was finishing the manuscript for ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' and I had the opportunity to look at it. That I had met the trinity of cooking -- Julia Child, James Beard and Craig Claiborne -- less than a year after arriving here is testament to how very small the food world was then.

In World at War, the 2008 iteration of the wildly popular Call of Duty series, the game designers, perhaps sensing that players were tiring of the pleasures of killing the soldiers of the Third Reich, introduced a new mode: Nazi zombies. Shooting already dead members of Hitler's army proved even more satisfying than doing the same to (digitally) living but historical Germans. Out with World War II, in with World War Z. The lineage isn't quite that simple, of course. Zombies have a long history in games, including seminal titles like Resident Evil (1996) and Wolfenstein 3D (1992), widely regarded as the original first-person shooter, which itself was about fighting some kind of undead/Nazi hybrid. And apocalyptic fiction has become unavoidable in post-Sept. 11 America, no matter the medium. The zombie subgenre is nearly as popular in novels and films as it is in video games."

Lillet Blanc was joined by red Lillet Rouge in 1962. This spring the drink has blossomed in pink. Lillet Rosé is essentially the blanc with some added red fruit liqueurs and a little of the Rouge for color -- a medley that is refreshing, a little fruity and excellent for a Mother's Day toast. But it is also so easy on the palate that the label should warn that, at 34 proof, it not be mistaken for rosé wine. Serving it on ice dilutes the alcohol.

We know what we would answer. Until two years ago, the nation's banks could automatically enroll customers in overdraft programs -- the result was tens of billions of dollars in overdraft fees. The Federal Reserve finally stepped in, requiring banks to get the customer's consent before enrolling them. But it should have done more: requiring reasonable, and proportional penalties; and pressing banks to develop ways of alerting debit card users before they overdraw."

Politeness, in other words, is not always rewarded in New York. This may be one reason La Silhouette, which opened a little more than a year ago in Hell's Kitchen, is still relatively unknown outside its neighborhood. Almost none of the people I took to La Silhouette had heard of it. By the end of the meal we would all be asking ourselves how a restaurant that works this hard at pleasing customers can be lost in the shuffle while the city showers attention on less comfortable places that are more skilled at boasting and preening."

The only problem -- or, rather, the characteristic paradox -- is that ''Sebaldian'' would have to mean something like ''systematically resistant to classification.'' Was he a novelist? A memoirist? A historian? A travel writer? When one of his publishers asked which category a book of Sebald's should be listed under, the author replied, ''All of them.''

On Tuesday, as Mr. Netanyahu stood shoulder to shoulder with Shaul Mofaz, a former defense minister and military chief of staff and now the leader of the centrist Kadima Party, and welcomed him into the governing coalition, it was as if the prime minister was offering some kind of response, especially for a jittery Israeli public generally averse to a lone Israeli strike against Iran's nuclear facilities."

Just as Governor Malloy's first session proved rocky after unions almost scuttled a deal to close one of the nation's worst deficits, this one has proved vexing as well.

The backdrop of most of their memories and nightmares is the Lodz ghetto, which outlasted all of Poland's other Jewish ghettos by becoming an industrial complex for the Nazi army. Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski, the Nazi-appointed, dictatorial Jewish leader of the ghetto, plays a prominent role in the family history as well. All this makes for a promising (if well-plumbed) premise for theatrical exploration. Unfortunately, the execution suffers. The characters are underwritten; the symbolism is overwrought; the performers overact; and the direction (by Ronald Cohen) is seriously underachieving."

2012-05-08T00:00:00Z,"FEW people expect to see their undergraduate musings about modern poetry splashed across the pages of Vanity Fair for millions to read. But then, few people emerge from their college years to become president of the United States. So President Obama couldn't have been too surprised to see the new issue of that magazine carrying an excerpt from the journalist David Maraniss's forthcoming biography, ''Barack Obama: The Story,'' which featured a letter that Mr. Obama wrote to his college girlfriend in the 1980s, discussing the worldview of T. S. Eliot's poetry and prose. ''Read his essay on Tradition and the Individual Talent, as well as Four Quartets ...'' wrote Mr. Obama, then in his early 20s. ''Remember how I said there's a certain kind of conservatism which I respect more than bourgeois liberalism -- Eliot is of this type. Of course, the dichotomy he maintains is reactionary, but it's due to a deep fatalism, not ignorance.''"

2012-05-08T00:00:00Z,"THE SCRIPT A male announcer says: ''An economic meltdown. Worst financial collapse since the Great Depression. 4.4 million jobs lost. All before this president took the oath. Some said our best days were behind us, but not him. He believed in us, fought for us. And today our auto industry is back, firing on all cylinders. Our greatest enemy brought to justice by our greatest heroes. Our troops are home from Iraq. Instead of losing jobs, we're creating them: over 4.2 million so far. We're not there yet. It's still too hard for too many. We're not there yet. It's still too hard for too many. But we're coming back -- because America's greatness comes from a strong middle class, because you don't quit. And neither does he. ON THE SCREEN The ad makes heavy use of old television clips that are intended to remind voters of the crisis President Obama confronted when he took office. Stories about huge job losses, a plummeting stock market and record home foreclosures are relayed by new anchors. The ad shifts when Mr. Obama is shown at his inauguration in 2009, raising his right hand and proclaiming ''So help me God.'' The visuals then become more positive. Workers are assembling cars in a factory. A young girl hugs her father, just home from war. Osama bin Laden's picture flashes on screen, but he goes unnamed as the announcer says the country's ''greatest enemy'' has been brought to justice."

Mr. Marx and the city must make certain that the renovation provides the widest possible public access to the library's collection. So far, the city has promised $150 million, and the library must come up with the balance.

2012-05-08T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (Sundance) TINY FURNITURE (2010) In the movie that eventually gave rise to HBO's ''Girls,'' Lena Dunham, above left with Jemima Kirke, portrays Aura, a recent film school graduate who breaks up with her boyfriend and moves back into a TriBeCa loft with her family of successful artists as she helps her mother prepare her younger sister for college. (Those characters are played by Ms. Dunham's mother and sister, the photographer Laurie Simmons and Grace Dunham.) Carrying around a pet hamster, she reunites with a childhood friend, Charlotte (Ms. Kirke), takes a job as a restaurant hostess and flirts with two men (Alex Karpovsky and David Call). ''As you watch Aura meander, you might start wondering when the 'real' story will kick in,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''You'll have to keep waiting.'' The film, she said, is ''a documentation of the drip drip drip of existence, with its highs, lows, banalities, outbursts, solitude and an acute self-consciousness about being subjected to forces beyond your control (ideology, boys, everyday weirdness).'' It is, Ms. Dargis added, ''more of a conceptual coup than an enjoyable experience.'' 1:40 P.M. (Starz) SOLITARY MAN (2010) Michael Douglas plays Ben Kalmen, a businessman trying to rebuild his life after cheating in his bookkeeping and on his wife (Susan Sarandon), disappointing his daughter (Jenna Fischer) and ending up divorced and shackled by legal troubles. Now his most recent companion (Mary-Louise Parker) may want him dead. Danny DeVito plays the old college friend who takes pity on Ben; Jesse Eisenberg is the student who warily accepts him as a mentor. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott said: ''The filmmakers' only misstep is to supply, early and late, a too-neat explanation for the slow-motion train wreck that Ben's life has become. But it is easy enough to ignore this lapse in the face of such unassumingly intelligent screenwriting and so much understated, brilliant acting.'' Especially that of Mr. Douglas, Mr. Scott added: ''After 'Wall Street' and 'Wonder Boys,' he could have played Ben Kalmen in his sleep, but instead he is fully alive, as engaged with the complexities of actorly portraiture as he has ever been.'' Oliver Stone's ''Wall Street'' (1987), starring Mr. Douglas as the ruthless corporate raider Gordon Gekko, will be shown at 3 on MoreMax."

It was developed by Chris Manca, the specialty products coordinator for the markets' Northeast division, who named it Point of Origin.

The same article praised four other places to eat, including Gaston, on East 49th Street, which ''may qualify as having one of the most inspired French kitchens in town,'' and Marchi's, on East 31st Street, ''one of New York's most unusual North Italian restaurants.'' The author of these judgments was Craig Claiborne, the newspaper's food editor. He prefaced his article with a short note: ''The following is a listing of New York restaurants that are recommended on the basis of varying merits. Such a listing will be published every Friday in The New York Times.''"

That's what I was thinking as I watched the enjoyable Broadway revival of ''Gore Vidal's The Best Man,'' the 1960 drama about rivals for their party's presidential nomination. And I have the feeling that much of the audience was thinking the same thing. I mean, those guys up onstage were so naturally epigrammatic, especially the ones with whom Mr. Vidal's sympathies lie, that they couldn't open their mouths without casting pearls before us swine in the audience."

Astonishingly, after only nine months at the paper, I was offered the job of restaurant critic. Again, it was Craig working behind the scenes. And there were many more examples. I suppose the closest I came to intimacy was the day I asked him to lunch in order to elicit advice concerning the job. A little emotional back story: Craig's mansion of woes had many rooms, one of which centered on his amorous relationship with a certain retired pediatrician named Jim. Jim lived in Florida with his unsuspecting (until she suspected) wife. Consequently, the two saw each other only occasionally. This is about all I knew, or cared to know."

What happens, Mr. Scott added, ''is something marvelous: a film that never raises its voice (its loudest and most assertive sound is that Ferrari) or panders to your emotions, but that nonetheless has the power to refresh your perceptions and deepen your sympathies.'' Mr. Dorff portrays an insane director who kidnaps an actress (Melanie Griffith) and forces her to be in his movie in John Waters's ''Cecil B. Demented'' (2000), at 8 on Flix. Writing in The Times, Stephen Holden called this ''an amusing, cunningly made but less-than-hilarious outcry against Hollywood philistinism, an easy target if ever there was one.''"

But on Sunday night, a new episode of that 1960s period drama that concluded with the Beatles song ''Tomorrow Never Knows'' appears to have made some history of its own, marking a rare instance in which a song written and recorded by that band has been licensed for use on a television series. ''It was always my feeling that the show lacked a certain authenticity because we never could have an actual master recording of the Beatles performing,'' Matthew Weiner, the creator and show runner of ''Mad Men,'' said in a telephone interview on Monday. ''Not just someone singing their song or a version of their song, but them, doing a song in the show. It always felt to me like a flaw. Because they are the band, probably, of the 20th century.''"

2012-05-10T00:00:00Z,"De GEORGE--Florence A.,Passed away peacefully the morning of Thursday May 3, 2012, at her home in Jupiter, Florida. She would have been 92 on July 2. Florence was born in New York City to Peter Paul Efel and Eugenia Budsalowska Efel. After her mother and father separated, Florence spent a good deal of her early years growing up on a Pennsylvania farm owned by her grandmother Aniela Budsalowska, with her mother, brother Peter P. Efel and sister Eugenia M. Efel. In addition to English, the children spoke Polish and Russian in the home, the native languages of their grandmother and mother. After graduating from high school and completing two years of college, Florence was among the first group of women volunteers to join the Women's Army Corps (WAC) after the outbreak of WWII. Florence was passionate about helping those affected by the War in Europe. Her great love for this country in part came from her parents and grandmother, who were naturalized citizens. Florence had family in the areas of Europe affected by the War and wanted to help; however, the limited role that women could play in the Army at that time was disappointing and she eventually resigned. In 1943, Florence met her husband to be, U.S. Navy Lieutenant (jg) Lawrence J. De George. Three months later, on December 18, 1943, they married in a military ceremony in Boston, just prior to Lawrence reporting for duty aboard a US Navy Destroyer guarding convoys in the North Atlantic. After the end of World War II, Florence dedicated herself to raising her two sons and focused on her passions: the arts, particularly music and dance; and later, commercial interior design. Throughout the 1950's and 1960's she produced, directed and choreographed productions for community theaters and local schools. Energetic and self-starting, she was always looking for a new challenge. Florence taught herself interior design and by 1988 completed several large commercial projects, which she designed and decorated. Two of these projects included the Amphenol Corporate building in Wallingford, Connecticut, and the seventh floor of the Seagram's Building on Park Avenue in New York City. Additionally, for seven years from 1986 to 1993, she served as an Amphenol Corporation director and member of the audit committee until the sale of the company in 1993. For the past twenty-one years, Florence and her late husband, Lawrence, were dedicated to helping children and have left a philanthropic legacy which will continue to make a difference in the lives of thousands of children for years to come. Florence and Lawrence loved all children but especially those in need. In 1991, Florence and her husband founded the Lawrence J. and Florence A. De George Charitable Trust. Florence stated, when interviewed about the Charitable Trust, My husband and I have always believed that every child deserves the best chance at life. The mission of our charitable trust has always been to support seriously ill and at risk children who struggle each day and need our help. Since 1991, Florence and her late husband dedicated themselves to fulfilling that mission. The charitable trust has donated well over one hundred million dollars under their direction. Among their many projects and donations, their charitable legacy includes two Florence A. De George Boys & Girls Clubs in Palm Beach and Broward counties; the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Islet Transplantation Research Project at Harvard Medical School; and Camp Boggy Creek in Eustis, Florida. To date, Camp Boggy Creek, which they cofounded with Paul Newman and General Norman H. Schwarzkopf, has provided an exciting, medically-sound camp experience for more than 50,000 chronic and terminally-ill youth. After her husband's death in April 2009, Florence continued the charitable trust legacy with several multiyear, multimillion-dollar grants to the American Heart Association (AHA) Research Grant; major funding for the new administrative and welcome center at Camp Boggy Creek and in January 2011, the ten million-dollar grant to fund the creation of a three-story, 75,000 square-foot Children's and Women's Healthcare Services facility, named the Florence A. De George Pavilion at Jupiter Medical Center. Florence loved her family and is preceded in death by her husband of 65 years, Lawrence J. De George. Florence is survived by her sons: Lawrence F. De George and wife Suzanne of Jupiter, Florida, and Peter R. De George of Jupiter, Florida; three grandchildren: Peter M. De George, Michael L. De George, both of Jupiter, Florida, and Brandi M. Martelli of Cheshire, Connecticut; three great-grandchildren: Brooke De George, Payton De George and Savanna Martelli. Florence was a devout Catholic. There will be a private family service. In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions be made to: Florence A. DeGeorge Boys and Girls Club of Palm Beach; Camp Boggy Creek or Jupiter Medical Center's Foundation for the Florence A. De George Pavilion. The Boys & Girls Clubs of Palm Beach County, Inc., 800 Northpoint Parkway - Suite 204 West Palm Beach, FL 33407-1946.

Biden Jr. all but forced the president's hand by embracing the idea of same-sex unions in a Sunday talk show interview."

2012-05-10T00:00:00Z,"Pity the poor translator. He (or more often she) works in the same solitary fashion as the novelist, poet, playwright or essayist but must be content with reflected glory: at best, his or her name in small type on the cover of a book, or, just as likely, relegated in smaller type to an interior page. Which is why an event like the Translation Slam on Thursday night, which was part of this year's PEN World Voices literary festival, must be a translator's delight, a rare opportunity to stand in the spotlight. The event, at the Bowery Poetry Club, was modeled on the poetry slams that have become popular in recent years, reaching even the White House. A pair of translators are given the same text three days in advance and asked to create their own versions in another language, which they read to an audience that can be appreciative, or not. It's part intellectual puzzle, part spectacle."

(13) FAUST Des McAnuff, the artistic director of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, whose revival of ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' is now on Broadway, makes his Metropolitan Opera debut with Gounod's ''Faust,'' updated to the 20th century. Jonas Kaufmann stars as a nuclear scientist, despairing of the effects of his life's work, who makes a contract with the Devil. Marina Poplavskaya, above with Mr. Kaufmann, is Marguerite, Faust's love interest and eventual victim, and René Pape reprises his role as Méphistophélès. Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducted this ''Great Performances at the Met'' presentation, which was shown live in movie theaters on Dec. 10. ''It is better if a production does not look too deeply for elements of existential despair that are simply not in the piece, and that seems the problem with the new 'Faust,' '' Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times, adding that this co-production with the English National Opera, ''though rich with ideas and theatrically daring, is finally rather clinical and oppressive.'' 7:45 A.M.

''There is, in Ms. Munro's mature work, a flinty wisdom about heterosexual love, a skepticism about romantic ideals that does not altogether deny their power or necessity,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''Ms. Polley, rather remarkably for someone still in her 20s, shows an intuitive grasp of this wisdom and a welcome, unsentimental interest in the puzzles and pleasures of a long, imperfect marriage.'' He added, ''I can't remember the last time the movies yielded up a love story so painful, so tender and so true.''"

2012-05-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''Ban on Gay Marriage Passes in North Carolina'' (news article, May 9): When I was a middle school student in the 1990s, a constant source of fear was the realization that I would never have what my parents had, or what all my friends' parents had. Gay marriage in New York State was still illegal, and when parents arrived together to pick their children up from school, I always saw something I could never accomplish. Banning gay marriage, as North Carolina voters did on Tuesday, means that for many children, this fear will persist: in churches, in schools and at home. This vote should be a call to action for any American who cares about keeping justice safe. PETER FULHAM Washington, May 9, 2012"

And those comparisons will surely be revived by Mr. Polanski's next film project: A political thriller to be called ''D,'' based on the story of Capt. Alfred Dreyfus. Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French Army, was tried for treason in 1894 for supposedly passing secrets to the Germans. He was convicted, sentenced to life in prison, and sent to Devil's Island, off South America. But an impassioned public defense by Émile Zola, and years of advocacy by others, ultimately led to his exoneration."

Her face swollen and bleeding, Megan was taken to an emergency room and stitched up. No one realized she had suffered a severe concussion until three weeks later, when a player ran into her during another game and she fell to the ground, suffering a seizure on the field. Doctors believe she experienced what's known as second impact syndrome, a sequence of events in which a child or teenager sustains a hit before a concussion fully heals, which can cause the brain to bleed or swell, even if the second impact is a moderate one."
2012-05-11T00:00:00Z,"The silence has been broken: ''Chaplin,'' a new musical about the life of the comic performer and cinema pioneer Charlie Chaplin, has found a Broadway home. The production, which features music and lyrics by Christopher Curtis and a book by Mr. Curtis and Thomas Meehan (''Annie,'' ''The Producers'' and ''Hairspray''), will be presented at the Barrymore Theater, where it will begin previews on Aug. 21 and have its opening night on Sept. 10, its press representatives said on Thursday. ''Chaplin'' will be directed and choreographed by Warren Carlyle, who had those duties on ''Hugh Jackman, Back on Broadway'' and also choreographed the recent Broadway revival of ''Follies.'' The musical, which chronicles Chaplin's upbringing, professional breakthroughs and personal and political scandals, was presented in 2010 at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego. Titled ''Limelight: The Story of Charlie Chaplin,'' that production was not praised as universally as, say, ''Modern Times'' or ''The Great Dictator.'' In a review for The Los Angeles Times, Charles McNulty wrote that that incarnation of the musical ''doesn't rise to the challenge with anything resembling bold invention.'' But the San Diego Theater Critics Circle named ''Limelight'' its best new musical of 2010."

King was named the first female commandant of the Army's elite drill sergeant school in 2009, proponents of gender equality in the military hailed the news as a watershed. But it did not take long for the grumbling to start. Students who flunked out of the school complained that she set unfair standards.

But with critically derided shows like ''Ghost the Musical'' and ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark'' now on the boards, Mr. Alessandrini couldn't resist a comeback. A 21st edition of ''Forbidden Broadway'' is now in the works, Mr. Alessandrini said on Thursday, with preview performances scheduled to begin on July 17 at the show's old home, the 47th Street Theater, and an opening night planned for late summer. He will once again write and direct the revue, which first ran off Broadway in 1982 and received a special Tony Award in 2006; various editions have been performed in dozens of American cities as well as in London, Tokyo and Sydney.

Falling squarely into the much-ado-about-nothing category, Annie J. Howell and Lisa Robinson's debut feature hovers over Sarah (Anna Margaret Hollyman), a bland Los Angeles technophile who relates more willingly to wires and processors than to the fetus in her womb. Deciding that this is clearly the fault of her long-estranged mother (the marvelous Mary Beth Peil), currently residing off the grid in the Arizona desert, Sarah sets out for an uninvited reunion. Detours to a nightmarish baby shower, a Skype-obsessed father and a Vegas masseuse prove depressingly uninvigorating to both Sarah's maternal instincts and the film around her."

Charles and Carol Francks Lifland, he graduated from Yale College (49) and Harvard Law School ('52), where he was president of the Harvard Law Review. After law school, he served two years in the Air Force General Counsel's Office and a year as law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan II. He joined Cahill in 1955, practicing there until his retirement in 2002. A preeminent antitrust practitioner, he advised a diverse array of clients on all aspects of trade and competition law. He published two books on antitrust law, and wrote the New York Law Journal's monthly ""Antitrust"" column for 33 years. He taught antitrust law at Fordham Law School from 1981 to 2004, and served more than 30 years as an antitrust instructor for the Practicing Law Institute. In 1997 the New York State Bar Association Antitrust Section awarded him its Distinguished Service Award, and in 2007 the Section renamed the award the William T. Lifland Service Award in his honor. At home in Princeton, he enjoyed making furniture, tinkering with electronics, and developing and printing his own photographs. He was an avid reader and loved the theatre, concerts, and opera. He enjoyed playing tennis, bicycling, and traveling. A longtime member of Trinity Church, Princeton, he was a chair of the Outreach Committee and member of the Ushers' Guild.

2012-05-11T00:00:00Z,"When Luli (Chloë Grace Moretz), the 13-year-old heroine of ''Hick,'' a botched coming-of-age story, decides to leave her Nebraska home for a glamorous life in Las Vegas, she takes off down the road, skipping. That's after she's practiced her Clint Eastwood moves in the mirror with her gun (a birthday present): ''You feel lucky, punk?'' Well, uh, do you? Directed by Derick Martini and adapted by Mr. Martini and Andrea Portes from her novel of the same title, ''Hick'' sends its young heroine -- more literary creation than credible teenager -- into the big, bad American heartland. It's a place of dank pool halls, one-street towns and shabby motels, a mythopoetic jumble of dangers and snares taken from other, better movies and books."

He died peacefully on May 10 in his New York apartment. Bert Geller was successful in his business as a furrier and was successful in his avocation of art. Bert was in the fur business, the Geller Brothers, with his beloved brother Marty Geller who pre-deceased him. After retiring, he took up painting and decorated his home in Florida with his art work, as well as the homes of his family. Painting was a great joy in his life and is a talent he passed on to his granddaughter, Emily. Bert was also a life- long athlete, and played handball, tennis and golf. Bert continued to play golf and bridge up until a few weeks before his death. Bert was devoted to his wife, his children and grandchildren, but particularly to his daughter Janet who has cerebral palsy. Janet continues to have a wonderful life provided by the Crystal Run Village Foundation of Middletown, New York. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that memorials be made to Crystal Run. A private burial service was held at Mt Hebron cemetery on Friday, May 11th."
2012-05-11T00:00:00Z,"The high price of oil is not the only effect of commodity inflation hitting the streets of New York. A surge in the value of copper, iron and other metals has fueled a wave of thefts from sidewalks, roadways and rail yards in the last few months. On Wednesday alone, the New York police arrested three men for stealing hunks of cast iron - grates made to protect tree roots and manhole covers weighing as much as 300 pounds. The arrests followed reports of the disappearance of dozens of the grates and covers across the city and came on top of a continuing spree of thefts of copper wire from utility cables."

Biden Jr. apologized to the president in the Oval Office for forcing Mr. Obama's hand by airing his own views three days earlier, several people briefed on the exchange said on Thursday. Mr. Biden declared in an interview on Sunday that he was ''absolutely comfortable'' with same-sex marriage, a position that went considerably further than the president's ''evolving'' views on the matter and scrambled the White House's carefully laid plans for confronting one of the most sensitive social issues in the election."

Mr. O'Reilly interviewed a psychiatrist who was critical of the inclusion of Mr. Bono on the program, but Mr. O'Reilly expressed support for Mr. Bono; he did not complain about Mr. Bono's participation. The article also misidentified the gay character in the ''Modern Family'' series on ABC who had a disdain for public displays of affection. The character is Mitchell Pritchett, not Cameron Tucker."

So far, China has not brought the United States into this renewed round of tension with the Philippines, but in the past few weeks the Chinese have said that the Philippines was daring to challenge China around an island in the South China Sea because of its alliance with Washington."

His extraordinary leadership of that effort followed one of the most distinguished careers in public service, which included serving as the Attorney General of the United States during the height of the Civil Rights movement and as the Under Secretary of State during the Vietnam conflict. Despite his extraordinary accomplishments, Nick was a humble, self-effacing man with a wonderful sense of humor.

2012-05-11T00:00:00Z,"Brian Harman would usually not be happy with a one-over-par 73 to open the Players Championship. This time, he will take it. Harman, a 25-year-old rookie, entered Thursday as the first alternate, but a last-second withdrawal by the tour veteran D. A. Points caused so much confusion that Harman barely got a spot. ''I had no idea what was going to happen,'' Harman said. ''I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little shook up by what happened.'' Points arrived at the No. 1 tee with his playing partners, Carl Pettersson and Robert Garrigus. Next to hit after Pettersson, Points told the starter that he was withdrawing with a back injury. By the time Harman learned a spot was available, he and his caddie, John Davenport, were playing table tennis in the clubhouse, while Pettersson and Garrigus were on the second hole. Harman arrived at the course at 7 a.m. and let officials know that he was there in case of a withdrawal. Davenport went to the first tee at 7:15 a.m. to remind officials that Harman was there. ''It happened very quickly -- we didn't have time to react,'' said Mark Russell, the tour's vice president for rules and competition. ''Very unusual situation. I mean, I've never seen anything like it really.'' Tour officials concluded that Harman had done nothing wrong and let him tee off from No. 1 at 12:20 p.m. as a single. On Friday, Harman will replace Paul Casey (shoulder injury) and will tee off at 2 p.m. with Bud Cauley and Ryan Moore. ''I thought it was the fair thing to do,'' Harman said."

(HBO) ONE DAY (2011) Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess (above) portray Emma and Dex -- she's bookish, serious and from a family of modest means; he's dashing, irresponsible and wealthy -- who meet, as drunken university graduates, on St. Swithin's Day in 1988 and proceed to reunite on that date, July 15, each year. Rafe Spall and Romola Garai play the characters who would seem to be Emma and Dex's perfect matches. Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson are Dex's parents. Lone Scherfig, ''a veteran of the Danish Dogme 95 movement, whose previous English-language films are 'Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself' and 'An Education,' can be a wonderfully centrifugal director, wandering away from the center of a conventional narrative toward its scruffy margins, where the interesting stuff happens,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''Her eccentric eye and offbeat rhythm sustain 'One Day' through its stretches of banality and mitigate some of its flaws. Among these are a superficial sense of history -- remember how girls used to wear their hair? remember nuclear disarmament? -- and, more seriously, a late, disastrous dive into the deep end of weepitude.'' 7:45 P.M.

Ms. Newton, who has appeared in films including ''Crash,'' ''Beloved'' and ''Mission: Impossible 2,'' will star in the new series, called ''Rogue.'' DirecTV said in a news release that the series would focus on Ms. Newton's character, a ''morally and emotionally conflicted cop'' named Grace, who is wrestling with the possibility that she may have contributed to the death of her son while she conducts an illicit affair with a high-ranking criminal who may have also been involved.

2012-05-12T00:00:00Z,"TRUONG--Tran Dinh, Vietnamese Businessman and Philanthropist. Tran Dinh Truong was born on January 5, 1932 in Ky-Anh, a town on the north central coast of Vietnam. At the end of 1958, knowing he had to seek a better life for himself, penniless, Mr. Tran fled the north by swimming across the Ben-Hai River, which was the demarcation line between the northern and southern part of the country by the Geneva Accords in 1954. Upon arriving in the south, he was immediately captured and placed in a prison camp for fugitives and deserters by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. While there, Mr. Tran stood out and caught the attention of a visiting priest who was in need of a driver and asked if Tran could drive. As it turned out, Father Khai was a special personal priest to the President, Ngo Dinh Diem and the rest is history. Mr. Tran was a devout Catholic with strong entrepreneurial spirits and a keen business sense; after working two years as a driver for Father Khai and winning over his admiration and respect, Mr. Tran sought a loan from his mentor and began buying and selling army supplies and uniforms. During this time he also met and married Nguyen Kim Sang, a recently crowned Miss Saigon and together they worked and built up a successful business which led them to Hiroshima, Japan in 1967 to buy their first cargo ship the Soe-Maru which later Tran changed the name to Sao Mai. By the early 1970s, their company Vishipco Lines was the largest shipping company in South Vietnam with a fleet of 24 ships. It was in April of 1975 when Mr. Tran fled his home once again during the last days of the fall of Saigon. Mr. Tran and his family were relocated and welcomed along with some other 150,000 Vietnamese refugees into the United States at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. For the second time in his life he was seeking a better way of living and when the family arrived in Times Square in their beat-up station wagon, Tran looked around and declared that, ""This is America!"" Poor English did not stop him and soon Mr. Tran found a suitable life in real estate with his purchase of the Hotel Opera on West 76th Street bought with the gold the family was carrying on their backs. Tran loved New York City and when the opportunity arose to purchase a second building located in Times Square in 1977, he jumped right on it against his lawyers' wishes. ""The Great White Way"" became his place of residence as he struggled through the tumultuous years in Times Square before it became the Crossroads of the World. From then on he began to build his real estate portfolio with historical buildings in New York City, Buffalo, New York and the Philadelphia area. Mr. Tran may be remembered and honored most for ordering one of his ships, the Truong Xuan, to carry over 3000 Vietnamese refugees out of Saigon on April 30, 1975. Those refugees eventually reached Hong Kong safely and have made their lives all over the world. In 1984, Tran's answer to the poverty and famine he was witnessing out of Ethiopia was to donate two helicopters for the use of relief and transport of food and medicine to the villages. He also sent heavy construction equipment and trucks to his hometown in Vietnam for road repairs and made yearly contributions to churches and congregations in Vietnam, and all across the United States where large populations of Vietnamese Catholics worship. Mr. Tran also generously donated $2 million dollars of his personal funds to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. It was a repayment to show his patriotism to the country that had rescued him and his family. Tran never forgot his humble beginnings both in his birth country and in the country that adopted him and his family. Tran Dinh Truong passed away on May 6, 2012 in his beloved Times Square home. He had suffered a stroke in late 2008 and never fully recovered. For the third and final time in his life, Tran has fled to a better place. He is a great loss to the Vietnamese community worldwide; as for his children, they will always miss the way their father used to sign off on his writings to them while they were away at school - his favorite song by Billy Joel, "" I love you 'Just The Way You Are.' "" He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Nguyen Kim Sang, and their four children, Teresa Yokoi of Westport, Connecticut and her husband Katsuhiko; Monica Tran of New York City and her husband Paul Carden; Joseph Tran of Dallas, Texas and his wife June Von Hoven; Victoria Tran of New York City and her fiance Brian McConville; his grandchildren Jessica, Jacob, Noah, Luc and Emmi. Family will receive friends on Saturday and Sunday 1-5pm at Frank E. Campbell 1076 Madison Ave. at 81st St. Mass of Christian Burial Monday 10am Holy Cross R.C. Church, 329 West 42nd St."

Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said that Mr. Fiennes and a certain albino dragon make the movie soar, as do Michael Gambon's brief turn as Dumbledore and Maggie Smith's ''visibly delighted marshaling of an army of stone soldiers'' as McGonagall. Finally too, Ms. Dargis said, there is Alan Rickman, ''who as Snape, Harry's longtime nemesis, lifts the movie to its expressive high point.'' That Snape ''has become such a brilliant screen character is due to Mr. Rickman, who helped elevate a child's tale of good and evil into a story of human struggle,'' she added.

Rich was born on April 16, 1959 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Frank and Miriam and brother to Keith and Frank, who predeceased him. He studied at West Hempstead High School and Columbia University, where he graduated in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in economics. Following college, Rich signed with the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League for a brief period. In 1982, Rich joined Goldman Sachs in New York and went on to serve the firm with distinction for nearly three decades. He began his career as a silver and gold trader on the floor of COMEX, moving to the floor of NYMEX in 1984 as one of the original people in the firm's energy platform. He was a member of the board of NYMEX for nine years. Rich moved to the firm's trading floor in 1990, becoming head of Natural Gas Trading in 1996 and in 1998, he relocated to Baltimore as one of the founding members of Goldman Sachs' electricity business. Rich was named head of Commodities in 2000 where he developed the firm's AssetCo business and was later appointed co-head of Global Macro Trading and then co-head of the Global Special Situations Group. He was named a managing director in 1996 and a partner in 1998.

In 1983, Rich married Ruthanne (nee Millnamow), daughter of James and Marion, who survives him, along with their children Craig, 18, and Caitlin, 17. Their marriage of almost 30 years, was built upon a friendship that started when they were youngsters, grew as they began dating in their teens and only deepened over the years. Their relationship was based upon mutual respect and a shared sense of family. Most of all, it was filled with passion and joy. Those who know Rich also know that beyond his professional success, he was most proud of his role as devoted husband and father."

2012-05-12T00:00:00Z,"CHAMBERLAIN--William Ellsworth passed away Saturday, May 5 in Palo Alto, California at the age of 91. Known as ""Bill,"" he was born August 16, 1920 in Providence, Rhode Island to William Chamberlain, Sr. and Kathryne Walsh. Bill had resided with his family in Palo Alto for the last forty years. After losing his mother at the age of three, Bill and his older sister Bernadette were raised by their maternal aunt, Julia Walsh, and their paternal grandparents, Catherine and Frank Chamberlain, who later moved them to Hartford, Connecticut. Bill graduated from Bulkeley High School in Hartford in 1938 and worked at Pratt & Whitney before enlisting in the Army in 1943. During World War II, he trained and served as a B-29 navigator in the U.S. Army Air Corps stationed at Harvard Air Force Base in Nebraska. After the war ended, he attended Brown University on the GI Bill, graduating in 1949 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. Bill went to work for the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics in its nuclear submarine program, where he worked with USN Admiral Hyman Rickover in the development and construction of the USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine. As part of the submarine program at EBD, Bill also did post-graduate work at Yale and MIT. His experience with nuclear power took him from General Dynamics to the Atomics Division of AMF Corporation in New York City. At the time AMF Atomics was involved in the U.S. Government's ""Atoms for Peace"" program that supplied nuclear equipment and information to schools, hospitals and research institutions within the U.S. and throughout the world. It was in 1957 that he met Bernadette Mitchel in New York City, and they were married the following spring. Bernadette's family was from San Francisco and Teaneck, New Jersey. Their early years were spent in New York City, where their children Claire and John were born. In 1963 Bill moved from AMF to the Utah Construction & Mining Company in San Francisco, where as Vice President he oversaw several projects including the construction of the BART trans-bay tube and the San Luis Rey Reservoir. Bill and Bernadette lived in San Francisco and welcomed a third child, Paul, later that year. It was in 1968 when Bill chose to leave the corporate world and begin his own venture in real estate development. He founded Transcentury Properties and developed sites in Northern California, the most noteworthy being the construction of Bodega Harbour, a community located along the Pacific Coast just south of Bodega Bay. In 1972 he and his family moved to Palo Alto. Bill remained active at Transcentury through 1980, and he continued his interest in real estate investing and development until his death. His wife Bernadette sadly preceded him in death in 1992. In 2005 after a long courtship, Bill married Claire Carew, formerly of San Francisco, and later adopted her children, Rodrigo and Maria. Throughout his remarkable life, Bill was an exceptional father and grandfather, a terrific listener who provided the rare combination of endless encouragement tempered by wise counsel, a wonderfully kind man with a twinkle in his eye and a light, yet ever present sense of humor. He was an avid reader of history, a keen fan of the World Series, and a man with an enormous interest in the well-being of others. He was immensely proud of his children and grandchildren, always encouraging them to pursue their interests with passion and to strive for excellence, all the while leading by example. He never stopped ""growing young."" Bill was so much for so long and to so many, yet above all else was known as the truest of gentlemen. Bill is survived by his wife Claire, his five children Claire, John, Paul, Rodrigo and Maria Chamberlain, his daughters-in-law Rebecca Schwartz Chamberlain and Martha Witbeck Chamberlain, and his ten grandchildren Carl, William and Jack Eckert; Laura, Sarah and Kathryne Chamberlain; and Eliza, William, Maggie and Grace Chamberlain. No words adequately express how much we will miss his voice and smile, yet no amount of time shall steal them from us. He is beloved in so many ways. Family and friends are invited to share in a celebration of Bill's life at St. Albert the Great Church in Palo Alto, California on August 18, 2012. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that contributions honoring Bill's memory may be made to: Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, 2700 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025."

Caro talked to Salas about an interview Salas had given James Mangan of The Associated Press in 1977 in which he said that Johnson ''did not win that election. It was stolen for him.'' And Caro drew on a handwritten memoir Salas gave him, in which he also described the cheating. Caro did not first learn of Salas's account when he ''uncovered'' the memoir.

2012-05-13T00:00:00Z,"MARY CHASE was wise about the comforting appeal that a divorce from reality offers. Her play ''HARVEY,'' about a man and his tall, invisible rabbit friend, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1944 and ran in its original Broadway production for more than four years. Now Roundabout Theater Company is reviving Chase's comedy in the first Broadway production of the 2012-13 season. When a show opens amid the feverish fuss about Tony Awards for the prior season, as ''Harvey'' is doing, its performances are often forgotten a year later. But the Roundabout has assembled a cast as likely to be memorable as any, led by Jim Parsons, the two-time Emmy Award winner for his portrayal of Sheldon Cooper, the charming nerd of a theoretical physicist on the CBS comedy ''The Big Bang Theory.'' He plays the rabbit-friendly Elwood P. Dowd, a role memorably played by James Stewart in the 1950 film version and the 1970 Broadway revival. Scott Ellis directs a cast that also includes Jessica Hecht, Charles Kimbrough, Larry Bryggman and Carol Kane. Previews begin Friday at Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org; $37 to $127."
2012-05-13T00:00:00Z,"DOES it say something about the state of the American musical theater that the animating incident in the most accomplished new Broadway show of the season is the repairing of a vacuum cleaner? It almost makes you nostalgic for those dark days when the talk of the Rialto was the spectacle of a chandelier plummeting toward the stage, or a helicopter landing on it. The fixing of the Hoover occurs in the first act of the musical ''Once,'' which transferred from New York Theater Workshop to Broadway this spring and racked up 11 Tony nominations, the biggest haul of any show this season. The musical depicts the hesitant blooming of love between a Dublin street singer who works in his father's vacuum-repair shop and a Czech immigrant who befriends him and encourages him to chase his dreams of becoming a guitar hero."

2012-05-13T00:00:00Z,"As an obstetrician for high-risk pregnancies who has cared for women with substance-abuse problems, I found the story of Amanda Kimbrough all too familiar. On a practical level, criminalizing any aspect of women's behavior during pregnancy has the exact opposite effect of what is intended: it alienates the very women who are most likely to benefit from prenatal care. Instead of protecting fetuses, this practice demonizes their mothers and sends them into hiding. Frequently this results in increased, rather than decreased, drug use. Which leads me to wonder if the purpose of these laws is really to protect fetuses. HYTHAM M. IMSEIS, M.D.,Charlotte, N.C."

2012-05-13T00:00:00Z,"LEE--Kie-Hong Daniel, passed away on April 29, 2012, in Seoul, Korea. Born on April 13, 1922, Kie-Hong Lee studied at Hiroshima Imperial Normal College, Seoul National University, Amherst College, Princeton University and Columbia University. A prominent economist, Kie-Hong Lee was the primary architect of Korea's first 5-year economic plan after the Korean War, laying the path for Korea to grow from a stagnant, tradition-oriented, agricultural society into a modern, dynamic, economic powerhouse. Among his many contributions to Korea's development, the reforestation of the peninsula following its devastation from Japanese occupation, World War II, and the Korean War is probably the most beautiful and lasting. Mr. Lee was the first Korean citizen to work as part of the professional staff at the United Nations, ECAFE, beginning in 1958. On May 16, 1961, when a coup d'etat in South Korea deposed the popularly elected government in South Korea, Mr. Lee was in Washington, D.C. to discuss Korea's economic development plans with Walt W. Rostow, Deputy Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and McGeorge Bundy, National Security Advisor. Mr. Lee declined an offer of refuge from the US government, and returned to the post-coup Korea to continue his work as an economist with the new government, quickly rising to the position of Assistant Minister, Economic Planning Board. Over the course of his long career, Mr. Lee worked as an economist at The World Bank, Managing Director of Korea-US Economic Council, Managing Director of Korea Trade Association, and publisher of Business Korea and Korea Business World magazines.

2012-05-13T00:00:00Z,"BRODY--Arthur. Entrepreneur, businessman, philanthropist. A resident of Rancho Santa Fe, passed away Thursday morning, May 10th following a brief illness. He was a month shy of his 92nd birthday and was a vital presence in the business and philanthropic life of the San Diego community. Arthur was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of pharmacy owners who had a small lending library in their store and who instilled in him a life-long passion for the written word. He studied electrical engineering at Columbia University and New York Technical Institute and it was during his college years that his talent for entrepreneurial enterprise emerged. Wanting to provide waterproof protection for textbooks, Arthur developed a way to turn clear photographic film into a protective cover; by the time he left school he had eight employees turning out his invention. From 1943-46, Arthur served as a commissioned officer in the Signal Corp of the United States Army. He taught the Theory of Frequency Modulation at the Army signal school in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey and also served in the European theater of operations. Following his army service, Arthur returned to his pursuit of business, founding the Brodart Company which grew to be the major manufacturer and distributor of library and school supplies and equipment in the country. He was granted a number of patents for library and office products and systems and his expertise in all things relating to educational and library tools made him a sought after member of boards and commissions of library organizations, including the Center of the Book at the Library of Congress. During this time Arthur and his wife, Sophie, were active with civic and philanthropic organizations and he became a member of the Young Presidents Organization, serving as the Chairman of the New Jersey Chapter in 1962 and 1963. He was one of eight founding members of the World Presidents Organization. Arthur became a private pilot and an avid yachtsman. Over the years he owned many boats and he loved to be out on the water cruising the inland waterways of the East coast from Maine to the Bahamas and, later, the southern California coast. In 1982 the Brodys relocated to Rancho Santa Fe. Arthur continued with numerous business pursuits even as he greatly expanded his involvement in civic and philanthropic organizations. He served on the boards of the San Diego Public Library, the Sanford-Burnham Institute, the UCSD Foundation, Rady School of Management, the San Diego Symphony, and Seacrest Retirement Village. He was the founding President of the UCSD Library Board and also served as President of the Jewish Community Foundation. One of his proudest involvements was helping to establish the Student Foundation at UCSD and he often followed the students' leads in selecting promising investments. It was as the President of the Sophie and Arthur Brody Foundation that Arthur addressed issues that were most important to him. His generosity was boundless, he had a huge heart, and he contributed generously to local, national and international charities. Aside from the organizations mentioned above, each of which was a major beneficiary of Arthur's largess, the Brody Foundation was a significant donor to Congregation Beth Israel, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, the Moores Cancer Center, the United Jewish Federation, and the American Joint Distribution Committee. Arthur was an extraordinary man with a great sense of humor and inexhaustible strength. He continued to be interested and engaged in his businesses and philanthropies until his final days. He was a loyal friend and will be missed by the many individuals for whom his presence was so vital. He was predeceased by his beloved wife of 60 years, Sophie. For the last seven years Arthur was blessed by the loving companionship of Phyllis Cohn. He is survived by his daughter Janice Brody (Bruce Rule), his son, Donald Brody (Toby Mickelson), and his five grandsons, Cameron, Pokey, Evan, Harris (Johanna) and Alex (Natalie). Services will be held at 1:00pm on Monday, May 14th at Congregation Beth Israel, 9001 Towne Center Drive, San Diego, 92122. Contributions in celebration of Arthur Brody's life may be made to the Sanford-Burnham Institute, the Jewish Community Foundation, the San Diego Symphony, or the Salk Institute for Biological Studies."

2012-05-13T00:00:00Z,"If Paul Krugman sees a difference between Ben Bernanke's academic writing and his current posture, maybe that's because Bernanke is no longer an academic, free to lob rhetorical missiles toward policy makers, which happens to be precisely what Krugman is doing. On the other hand, Krugman is right to feel frustrated at the pace of economic recovery and question whether there isn't a way for policy makers to do more. Unfortunately for the country, with just six months before the presidential election, political concerns are now paramount among our nation's leaders, which reduces the likelihood of aggressive Fed action. In a way, the Krugman-vs.-Bernanke debate symbolizes one of the great narratives of President Obama's first term: What happens when bold ideas run smack into the responsibility -- and political considerations -- of actually governing and maintaining public support to continue doing so?"

2012-05-13T00:00:00Z,"TRAN--Truong Dinh, Vietnamese Businessman and Philanthropist. Tran Dinh Truong was born on January 5, 1932 in Ky-Anh, a town on the north central coast of Vietnam. At the end of 1958, knowing he had to seek a better life for himself, penniless, Mr. Tran fled the north by swimming across the Ben-Hai River, which was the demarcation line between the northern and southern part of the country by the Geneva Accords in 1954. Upon arriving in the south, he was immediately captured and placed in a prison camp for fugitives and deserters by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. While there, Mr. Tran stood out and caught the attention of a visiting priest who was in need of a driver and asked if Tran could drive. As it turned out, Father Khai was a special personal priest to the President, Ngo Dinh Diem and the rest is history. Mr. Tran was a devout Catholic with strong entrepreneurial spirits and a keen business sense; after working two years as a driver for Father Khai and winning over his admiration and respect, Mr. Tran sought a loan from his mentor and began buying and selling army supplies and uniforms. During this time he also met and married Nguyen Kim Sang, a recently crowned Miss Saigon and together they worked and built up a successful business which led them to Hiroshima, Japan in 1967 to buy their first cargo ship the Soe-Maru which later Tran changed the name to Sao Mai. By the early 1970s, their company Vishipco Lines was the largest shipping company in South Vietnam with a fleet of 24 ships. It was in April of 1975 when Mr. Tran fled his home once again during the last days of the fall of Saigon. Mr. Tran and his family were relocated and welcomed along with some other 150,000 Vietnamese refugees into the United States at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. For the second time in his life he was seeking a better way of living and when the family arrived in Times Square in their beat-up station wagon, Tran looked around and declared that, ""This is America!"" Poor English did not stop him and soon Mr. Tran found a suitable life in real estate with his purchase of the Hotel Opera on West 76th Street bought with the gold the family was carrying on their backs. Tran loved New York City and when the opportunity arose to purchase a second building located in Times Square in 1977, he jumped right on it against his lawyers' wishes. ""The Great White Way"" became his place of residence as he struggled through the tumultuous years in Times Square before it became the Crossroads of the World. From then on he began to build his real estate portfolio with historical buildings in New York City, Buffalo, New York and the Philadelphia area. Mr. Tran may be remembered and honored most for ordering one of his ships, the Truong Xuan, to carry over 3000 Vietnamese refugees out of Saigon on April 30, 1975. Those refugees eventually reached Hong Kong safely and have made their lives all over the world. In 1984, Tran's answer to the poverty and famine he was witnessing out of Ethiopia was to donate two helicopters for the use of relief and transport of food and medicine to the villages. He also sent heavy construction equipment and trucks to his hometown in Vietnam for road repairs and made yearly contributions to churches and congregations in Vietnam, and all across the United States where large populations of Vietnamese Catholics worship. Mr. Tran also generously donated $2 million dollars of his personal funds to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. It was a repayment to show his patriotism to the country that had rescued him and his family. Tran never forgot his humble beginnings both in his birth country and in the country that adopted him and his family. Tran Dinh Truong passed away on May 6, 2012 in his beloved Times Square home. He had suffered a stroke in late 2008 and never fully recovered. For the third and final time in his life, Tran has fled to a better place. He is a great loss to the Vietnamese community worldwide; as for his children, they will always miss the way their father used to sign off on his writings to them while they were away at school - his favorite song by Billy Joel, "" I love you 'Just The Way You Are.' "" He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Nguyen Kim Sang, and their four children, Teresa Yokoi of Westport, Connecticut and her husband Katsuhiko; Monica Tran of New York City and her husband Paul Carden; Joseph Tran of Dallas, Texas and his wife June Von Hoven; Victoria Tran of New York City and her fiance Brian McConville; his grandchildren Jessica, Jacob, Noah, Luc and Emmi.

And its commitment to filmmakers like Ang Lee (''Brokeback Mountain,'' ''Lust, Caution,'' ''Taking Woodstock''), Joel and Ethan Coen (''Burn After Reading,'' ''A Serious Man'') and Sofia Coppola (''Lost in Translation,'' ''Somewhere'') indicate its seriousness of artistic purpose. Ten of its most important films are being shown at the Museum of Modern Art's 10th anniversary celebration, which began May 3 and continues through next Sunday. Probably the most crucial, shown May 6, was the gay cowboy love story ''Brokeback Mountain,'' which cost $14 million to make and grossed $83 million in the United States. But there are still screenings of ''Lost in Translation'' (this Sunday), Lisa Cholodenko's ''Kids Are All Right'' (Friday), Michel Gondry's mind-twisting ''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'' (Saturday) and David Cronenberg's ''Eastern Promises'' (next Sunday). All are worthy. Information: (212) 708-9400, moma.org."

2012-05-13T00:00:00Z,"IN a historic interview last week, President Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage. As he discussed his journey toward that position, the president sounded many familiar themes, like the importance of distinguishing between civil and religious marriage and of living up to American ideals of fairness. At the core of his narrative, however, was a relatively novel element -- an affirmation of gay couples as parents. The president repeatedly attributed his ''evolution'' to his contact not only with gay couples but also with their children. He described thinking about staff members ''who are incredibly committed, in monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together.'' He discussed meeting same-sex couples and seeing ''how caring they are, how much love they have in their hearts -- how they're taking care of their kids.''"

Born August 27, 1936, in Maplewood, NJ, he was the eldest of four children of Herman and Sylvia Marcus. Leon graduated high school at the age of 16, finished Lafayette College at 19 and then went on to Columbia Law School. He was told that he was the youngest person ever admitted to the bar. Leon began his career in bankruptcy law, when corporate law firms deemed that practice area second class. Leon became one of the most notable personalities of the bankruptcy bar. Leon soon built one of the preeminent small bankruptcy firms in New York City. Among his high profile cases were the Pan Am, US Steel, Braniff Airlines, and REA Express to name a few. Leon was an avid sailor, fisherman and tennis player. A perpetual student of life, he devoured books on American history. He married five times, had five children, and was legal guardian to one other. He always loved being around his children and often said they were his greatest accomplishment in life. In 1969 Leon was first diagnosed with cancer and then again in 1977. Told he would not survive the year, he said he wanted to be able to enjoy his last days with his family doing what he loved. Leon bought a sailboat named it ""Endgame"" and with his family sailed for six months throughout the eastern Atlantic. Shortly after his return, his cancer was diagnosed as ""in remission."" Then in 1987, his cancer returned, and was an on-again off-again battle the remainder of his life. In 2002 he moved with his youngest daughter Sarah to Nova Scotia, where he lived for several years before moving back to the states to be with his daughter Kati and her family. Leon is survived by his five children: Brad Marcus of Connecticut, Eric Marcus of Florida, Spencer Marcus of New Jersey, Kati Biren of Minnesota and Sarah Marcus of Canada.

Wagner fans were disappointed when Ms. Brewer withdrew from singing Brünnhilde in the final presentation of Otto Schenk's production of the ''Ring'' at the Met in 2009. Her Met career has amounted to two performances in the lead role of Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos.'' At 56 she sounds in her prime, her enormous yet plush and lyrically pliant voice ideal for Wagner and Strauss soprano roles. But Ms. Brewer seems to prefer recitals and concerts with orchestras over opera. Her last appearance in New York was as a soloist in the Boston Symphony Orchestra's performance of Beethoven's ''Missa Solemnis'' at Carnegie Hall in March. For this recital she is joined by the exceptional pianist Craig Rutenberg.

The son of Mr. Tran Toi Lac and Mrs. Le Thi Tu, Mr. Tran was born and raised in Vietnam and was the principal owner of Vishipco Line, the largest shipping company in South Vietnam during the 1970s. He left Vietnam with his families on April 30, 1975, the day Saigon fell to the Communists, boarding one of his eleven ships with only two gold filled suitcases and an American dream. The journey was long, but the Tran families eventually landed in New York City, where Mr. Tran began his new career in hospitality, first with the Hotel Opera on the Upper West Side, and then Hotel Carter in Midtown Manhattan, a purchase which also included Hotel Lafayette, in Buffalo, New York and Hotel Kenmore in Manhattan. Through the years, there were many other real estate holdings, but his greatest accomplishment was his humanitarian work, which included a personal contribution of $2 million dollars to The American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In May 2004, Mr. Tran was awarded a Golden Torch Award by the Vietnamese American National Gala in Washington, D.C. Mr. Tran was also on the Board of Directors of The United Way of New York City.

2012-05-13T00:00:00Z,"THERE is an ongoing debate in this country about the rich: who they are, what their social role may be, whether they are good or bad. Well, consider the following. A recent study found that 10 percent of people who work on Wall Street are ''clinical psychopaths,'' exhibiting a lack of interest in and empathy for others and an ''unparalleled capacity for lying, fabrication, and manipulation.'' (The proportion at large is 1 percent.) Another study concluded that the rich are more likely to lie, cheat and break the law. The only thing that puzzles me about these claims is that anyone would find them surprising. Wall Street is capitalism in its purest form, and capitalism is predicated on bad behavior. This should hardly be news. The English writer Bernard Mandeville asserted nearly as much three centuries ago in a satirical-poem-cum-philosophical-treatise called ''The Fable of the Bees.''"

But once the wood-grilling expert persuaded his European and American friends to make the trip inland -- Garzón is about 40 miles northeast of Punta del Este, the glamorous seaside resort -- word began to spread about the town's old-time charms: gauchos riding on horseback along tidy gravel streets, residents greeting one another by name, and children playing in a flower-filled central plaza. Now Mr. Mallmann has company. Along with the arrival of travelers in search of epicurean fare came a smattering of new restaurants, boutiques and high-end establishments, including a winery, bringing new life into this quiet corner of the Uruguayan countryside.

2012-05-13T00:00:00Z,"LEE--Kie-Hong Daniel, passed away on April 29, 2012, in Seoul, Korea. Born on April 13, 1922, Kie-Hong Lee studied at Hiroshima Imperial Normal College, Seoul National University, Amherst College, Princeton University and Columbia University. A prominent economist, Kie-Hong Lee was the primary architect of Korea's first 5-year economic plan after the Korean War, laying the path for Korea to grow from a stagnant, tradition-oriented, agricultural society into a modern, dynamic, economic powerhouse. Among his many contributions to Korea's development, the reforestation of the peninsula following its devastation from Japanese occupation, World War II, and the Korean War is probably the most beautiful and lasting. Mr. Lee was the first Korean citizen to work as part of the professional staff at the United Nations, ECAFE, beginning in 1958. On May 16, 1961, when a coup d'etat in South Korea deposed the popularly elected government in South Korea, Mr. Lee was in Washington, D.C. to discuss Korea's economic development plans with Walt W. Rostow, Deputy Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and McGeorge Bundy, National Security Advisor. Mr. Lee declined an offer of refuge from the US government, and returned to the post-coup Korea to continue his work as an economist with the new government, quickly rising to the position of Assistant Minister, Economic Planning Board. Over the course of his long career, Mr. Lee worked as an economist at The World Bank, Managing Director of Korea-US Economic Council, Managing Director of Korea Trade Association, and publisher of Business Korea and Korea Business World magazines. A strong advocate of advanced education for women, Mr. Lee was a former president of the Amherst College Alumni Association in Korea. He was also president of the Seoul Rotary Club. In 1989 he became one of the founding members of the Committee of 300 Free Thinkers, an outspoken group of former Korean government ministers and influential leaders in fields of economics, education, law, finance and industry dedicated to maintaining the development of the Republic by publishing loyal critiques of unwise government policies, while espousing values of truth, intellectual freedom, market economics, and integrity in leadership. Mr. Lee is survived by his wife Young-Ja, four children, Margaret, Thai, Celeste, and Changsuk, sons-in-law Al Njoo and Kevin C. McCann, daughter-in-law Young Wook Kang, and grandchildren Albert Njoo, Andrew Njoo, Daniel Njoo, Victor Leo, Hanah Lee, Noel McCann, Saymin Lee, Minjoon Lee, and Andy Whang."

2012-05-13T00:00:00Z,"FROM most choreographers a dance advertised as ''a psychedelia-inspired kaleidoscope'' and ''catharsis'' would go a long way toward prompting me not to see it. But LUCIANA ACHUGAR is not most choreographers. There is something fantastically witchy and singular about her performances; she has a rare ability to create worlds of abandon for her audiences without losing her own head, so that her dances are as smart as they are sensual. This Uruguayan choreographer, long based in New York, is a great collapser of space: between the audience and the artists, the intellect and the physical. Earthy, often awkward movements, repeated again and again, become ritualistic. The female body (Ms. Achugar often works with women, playing with stereotypes even as she explodes them) courts forces both sexual and sinister."

When the Wainwrights get into it, the spat often shows up in a full-blown song, which begets other songs. That kind of thing will happen when one of America's most bracing folk writers, Loudon Wainwright III, marries another folk luminary, Kate McGarrigle of the McGarrigle Sisters, and they have two musically gifted children, Rufus and Martha. Factor in a serious relationship, which has long ended, with another member of the folk pantheon -- with Suzzy Roche of the Roches, that produced yet another musical offspring, Lucy Wainwright Roche -- and cue decades of songs, many of them about a complicated life in a family of musical royalty. Some of those songs have titles that don't scan well in a family newspaper, including Loudon's ditty about a fight for position at the breast of Rufus's mother and Martha's profane rocket aimed at her father's shortcomings. Back and forth it goes, with Rufus's ''Dinner at Eight'' revealing that supper at the Wainwrights was sometimes more dark indie movie than sitcom. But as a clan they never let a song get in the way of firmer, more durable ties. On Friday many members of the family will gather at Town Hall to mark the recent release of Loudon Wainwright's album ''Older Than My Old Man Now'' (2nd Story Sound Records), a bracing look back that includes references to -- and performances by -- various Wainwrights, Roches and McGarrigles. Even the departed are represented, with a spoken recitation of a meditation on family written by Loudon's father, a columnist for Life magazine, along with the only song Loudon Wainwright ever wrote with McGarrigle, who died in 2010."

2012-05-13T00:00:00Z,"BEFORE you dismiss a candle as too obvious for a Mother's Day gift, consider this: Good candles, ones that smell luxurious and come in beguiling pots or canisters, are neither too cheap (some, like Fornasetti's limited edition Cammei Oro, can cost hundreds of dollars) nor too expensive (Carrière Frères Industrie's are all less than $50). Their fragrances can be layered, delicate, even appetizing concoctions that blend, say, tulips, chimney smoke, dried vines and a brick wall (see Tisane by Tatine's St. John's Wood). Packaged in Bakelite (James de Givenchy for Taffin), blue glass (Cire Trudon) or porcelain (Juliska), their cups are worth cleaning and keeping for use as a flower vase, desk accessory or button jar. As presents, candles might at first seem impersonal, but give your sister the signature scent of her favorite SoulCycle classes (Jonathan Adler's special edition grapefruit candle), or your brother one that matches his surf wax (Ted Shred's), and neither would accuse you of being inconsiderate. In fact, because smell is so closely linked to memory, candles can be quite sentimental -- take the one that burned at the hotel where you honeymooned, for example; the one that scented the now-closed but much-missed boutique in NoLIta where you bought the wedges you wore to your first job interview; the one that smells like home. To prove that candles are, indeed, great and giftworthy for Mother's Day and beyond, we collected the very best scents in the very best-looking vessels. Get a whiff! JANE HERMAN"

Imagine if football players practiced in wide-open fields with no attempt to stay within any lines or boundaries. Imagine if basketball players practiced only free throws, forsaking all dribbling, running or jumping. Imagine if baseball players in practice only hit balls off a tee."

2012-05-14T00:00:00Z,"Updated 5:15 p.m. | Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in a commencement address at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Sunday, delivered a spirited defense of the right of gays and lesbians to marry, just days after North Carolina passed an amendment that banned the practice. ''Each and every generation has removed some barrier to full participation in the American dream,'' the mayor said. ''I would argue last week's referendum banning same-sex marriage shows just how much more work needs to be done to ensure freedom and equality for all people.'' Mr. Bloomberg has become a vocal supporter of same-sex marriage, which was legalized by the New York State Legislature last year, and he chairs a group, ''Mayors for the Freedom to Marry,'' that supports ''ending marriage discrimination at all levels of government.''"

If you're lucky enough to be near a practice facility that has a putting green, there might be a line of people waiting for a stall to whack away with the irons and woods, but the practice putting and chipping area will probably be deserted. Putting is, admittedly, too simple: roll that little ball over into that little hole. People don't feel they have to waste their precious, limited practice time perfecting something so elementary. But P.G.A. teaching professionals who have spent their entire careers trying to get golfers to play better overwhelming insist that the easiest and most time-efficient way to score lower is to work on the putting stroke. This advice usually goes unheeded because most golfers think they are far better at putting than they really are."
2012-05-14T00:00:00Z,"BRODY--Arthur. Entrepreneur, businessman, philanthropist. A resident of Rancho Santa Fe, passed away Thursday morning, May 10th following a brief illness. He was a month shy of his 92nd birthday and was a vital presence in the business and philanthropic life of the San Diego community. Arthur was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of pharmacy owners who had a small lending library in their store and who instilled in him a life-long passion for the written word. He studied electrical engineering at Columbia University and New York Technical Institute and it was during his college years that his talent for entrepreneurial enterprise emerged. Wanting to provide waterproof protection for textbooks, Arthur developed a way to turn clear photographic film into a protective cover; by the time he left school he had eight employees turning out his invention. From 1943-46, Arthur served as a commissioned officer in the Signal Corp of the United States Army. He taught the Theory of Frequency Modulation at the Army signal school in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey and also served in the European theater of operations. Following his army service, Arthur returned to his pursuit of business, founding the Brodart Company which grew to be the major manufacturer and distributor of library and school supplies and equipment in the country. He was granted a number of patents for library and office products and systems and his expertise in all things relating to educational and library tools made him a sought after member of boards and commissions of library organizations, including the Center of the Book at the Library of Congress. During this time Arthur and his wife, Sophie, were active with civic and philanthropic organizations and he became a member of the Young Presidents Organization, serving as the Chairman of the New Jersey Chapter in 1962 and 1963. He was one of eight founding members of the World Presidents Organization. Arthur became a private pilot and an avid yachtsman. Over the years he owned many boats and he loved to be out on the water cruising the inland waterways of the East coast from Maine to the Bahamas and, later, the southern California coast. In 1982 the Brodys relocated to Rancho Santa Fe. Arthur continued with numerous business pursuits even as he greatly expanded his involvement in civic and philanthropic organizations. He served on the boards of the San Diego Public Library, the Sanford-Burnham Institute, the UCSD Foundation, Rady School of Management, the San Diego Symphony, and Seacrest Retirement Village. He was the founding President of the UCSD Library Board and also served as President of the Jewish Community Foundation. One of his proudest involvements was helping to establish the Student Foundation at UCSD and he often followed the students' leads in selecting promising investments. It was as the President of the Sophie and Arthur Brody Foundation that Arthur addressed issues that were most important to him. His generosity was boundless, he had a huge heart, and he contributed generously to local, national and international charities. Aside from the organizations mentioned above, each of which was a major beneficiary of Arthur's largess, the Brody Foundation was a significant donor to Congregation Beth Israel, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, the Moores Cancer Center, the United Jewish Federation, and the American Joint Distribution Committee. Arthur was an extraordinary man with a great sense of humor and inexhaustible strength. He continued to be interested and engaged in his businesses and philanthropies until his final days. He was a loyal friend and will be missed by the many individuals for whom his presence was so vital. He was predeceased by his beloved wife of 60 years, Sophie. For the last seven years Arthur was blessed by the loving companionship of Phyllis Cohn. He is survived by his daughter Janice Brody (Bruce Rule), his son, Donald Brody (Toby Mickelson), and his five grandsons, Cameron, Pokey, Evan, Harris (Johanna) and Alex (Natalie). Services will be held at 1:00pm on Monday, May 14th at Congregation Beth Israel, 9001 Towne Center Drive, San Diego, 92122. Contributions in celebration of Arthur Brody's life may be made to the Sanford-Burnham Institute, the Jewish Community Foundation, the San Diego Symphony, or the Salk Institute for Biological Studies."

2012-05-14T00:00:00Z,"TRAN--Truong Dinh. Vietnamese businessman Tran Dinh Truong passed away at his home and business, Hotel Carter, on Sunday, May 6, 2012. He was 80 years old. The son of Mr. Tran Toi Lac and Mrs. Le Thi Tu, Mr. Tran was born and raised in Vietnam and was the principal owner of Vishipco Line, the largest shipping company in South Vietnam during the 1970s. He left Vietnam with his families on April 30, 1975, the day Saigon fell to the Communists, boarding one of his eleven ships with only two gold filled suitcases and an American dream. The journey was long, but the Tran families eventually landed in New York City, where Mr. Tran began his new career in hospitality, first with the Hotel Opera on the Upper West Side, and then Hotel Carter in Midtown Manhattan, a purchase which also included Hotel Lafayette, in Buffalo, New York and Hotel Kenmore in Manhattan. Through the years, there were many other real estate holdings, but his greatest accomplishment was his humanitarian work, which included a personal contribution of $2 million dollars to The American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In May 2004, Mr. Tran was awarded a Golden Torch Award by the Vietnamese American National Gala in Washington, D.C. Mr. Tran was also on the Board of Directors of The United Way of New York City.

2012-05-14T00:00:00Z,"The British period drama ''Downton Abbey'' may be a hit for PBS, but how much box-office allure will one of its stars have on Broadway? That proposition will be tested this fall: Dan Stevens, who stars on ''Downton Abbey'' as Matthew Crawley, the reluctant heir, will play the far more callow character Morris Townsend in a revival of ''The Heiress.'' He will star opposite the previously announced Jessica Chastain as Catherine Sloper, the title role, and David Strathairn as Catherine's father, who regards Morris as a gold digger. Mr. Stevens has acted extensively in British theater, including in the lead role of the tutor Septimus in the 2009 West End revival of Tom Stoppard's ''Arcadia.''

The project, ''Mobile Homestead,'' had been in the planning stages for several years, and a small piece of the home, a trailer-house-size recreation of part of its facade, made a kind of ancestral journey - on wheels, towed behind a truck - in 2010 from downtown Detroit back to the suburb of Westland where the former Kelley family home still stands.

''Dark Shadows,'' a $150 million horror comedy starring Johnny Depp, was a distant second, with about $28.8 million in ticket sales. Based on the 1960s-era vampire soap opera, ''Dark Shadows'' (Warner Brothers) looked solid on paper despite Hollywood's mixed success at adapting TV shows for the big screen: Mr. Burton and Mr. Depp have a track record for delivering hits, including the 2010 smash ''Alice in Wonderland.''

Warner's marketing campaign, while visually stunning, had a hard time clearly positioning Mr. Burton's offbeat movie (is it a comedy? a campy horror movie? an ''Addams Family'' update?), and some analysts worry that audiences are becoming blasé about Mr. Depp's eccentric characters.

Several plays close right afterward, because of a lack of awards or because their star actors want to return to Hollywood (or go on vacation). But this month has been notably good for many plays, including some without stars. Last week 10 of the 14 plays on Broadway grossed more than 40 percent of the maximum possible amount - an indication that they broke even or turned a profit. ''Death of a Salesman,'' starring Philip Seymour Hoffman and Andrew Garfield, grossed by far the most, $934,861 - a total aided by top ticket prices of $425, the sort of premium pricing that usually only hit musicals can charge safely. Another revival, ''Gore Vidal's The Best Man,'' starring James Earl Jones, grossed $737,996 (with a top ticket of $225), while a third revival - ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' with Blair Underwood - took in $446,069 (with a $197.50 top ticket)."

Then we learned that none of it actually matters. Since the Infant Formula Act of 1980, the F.D.A. makes sure that all formula is pretty much the same, no matter which one you buy. Despite knowing this, I still insist on paying twice as much for Enfamil, which its maker claims is ''scientifically designed.'' (Aren't they all?) I splurge because Mead Johnson is a 107-year-old company that has been promoting a single baby-formula brand for more than 50 years. I figure that it's less likely to squander its name by skirting the rules or engaging in shoddy manufacturing than a company with less to lose. This peace of mind costs me about $7 per day."

Before her death last July, Ms. Winehouse, a soul singer who struggled with drugs and alcohol, had had a relationship with Mr. Doherty, a fellow musician and troubled soul. During their time together they worked on a painting called ''Ladylike,'' for which Ms. Winehouse contributed a minimalist self-portrait and which uses an artistic technique Mr. Doherty calls ''arterial splatter'': illustrations made with blood from a syringe or a sliced-open fingertip."

(HBO) THE WEIGHT OF THE NATION More than two-thirds of the adults in the United States and one-third of children are overweight, leading to an increase in deaths from heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, stroke and kidney disease. This four-part documentary -- a collaboration by HBO, the Institute of Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health -- is at the center of a public health campaign that includes a book, a social media component and an effort to reach more than 40,000 community groups. Part 3, ''Children in Crisis,'' looks at the struggle of overweight children and at their medical issues; above, a middle school gym class in Austin, Tex. It also examines school lunch standards and the debate over the definition of good nutrition among food and beverage makers, researchers and the government. The conclusion, ''Challenges,'' at 9:10, explores factors behind the obesity epidemic, including subsidized agriculture, evolutionary biology, racial and socioeconomic disparities, physical inactivity and the strong influence of the food and beverage industry. ''It wouldn't surprise me if people look back on the early part of the 21st century and call this the obesity era,'' says Dr. Thomas Farley, the New York City health commissioner. 9 A.M. (Sundance) ENCOUNTERS AT THE END OF THE WORLD (2008) For this documentary Werner Herzog traveled to Antarctica, where he met scientists and journeymen at the American outpost McMurdo Station and the penguins, seals, clams and jellyfish that surround them on what might as well be another planet. ''Few filmmakers make the end of days seem as hauntingly beautiful as Werner Herzog does, or as inexorable,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. One of the film's beauties, Ms. Dargis said, ''is that all the furry and floating animals are no more wondrous than the bipeds tramping through and around McMurdo: the linguist turned philosopher, the banker turned bus driver, and the female adventurer who, for drama and odd entertainment, likes to have herself zipped up in a carryall bag. (She's her own baggage.) Mr. Herzog opens his mind, heart and eyes to all these wayfarers who -- despite the persistent strain of melancholy that touches each and every person who appears on camera -- seem eerily at peace at the bottom of the world.'' The film received an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature."

The Upper East Side shop has few seats and an open kitchen, where Ms. Cumming bakes cakes, above, as well as muffins, cookies and squares. In place of wheat flour, she uses white and brown rice flour and teff, a type of grain, as well as potato and corn starches, with excellent results.

Ada Maria was born in La Habana, Cuba, on March 22, 1943, the daughter of Josefina Diaz de Isasi and Domingo G. Isasi-Battle (RIP 2005). She lived her youth in Cuba, studying in La Habana where she graduated from Merici Academy in 1960. She moved to the United States in 1960 with her family, and soon after entered the Ursuline novitiate in Santa Rosa, California. After finishing studies at New Rochelle College, NY, Ada was sent to Lima, Peru by the order to work among the poor in the ""barriada de Miramar"". There she became passionate in caring for the dispossessed and building the ""kin-dom"" of God. After leaving the convent in 1969, she lived with her family in the United States. Realizing that she had a continued calling to be an educator and a voice for the underprivileged, Ada Maria moved in 1975 to Rochester, New York where she served in two inner city parishes and became involved in the Women's Ordination Conference (WOC). Ada Maria earned a Masters of Divinity and a Doctorate in Theology from Union Theological Seminary, in New York City in 1990. At Union, she started her lifelong engagement and leadership in the community of Liberation Theologians. Continuing her commitment to women's issues, she coined the term Mujerista theology to make explicit the Latina voice in Feminist Liberation Theology. In 1991, Ada Maria became a professor of Ethics and Theology at Drew University, Madison, NJ from where she retired in 2009. Students were very fond of her and described her as someone who was a demanding teacher, fair, honest and passionate. While at Drew University, she co-founded the Hispanic Theological Institute for training of Hispanic Theologians.She was a prolific writer, completing eight books, and many scholarly articles.' Her seminal work was Mujerista Theology: a Theology for the 21st Century. She is survived and remembered by her mother, sisters, and brother, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, her nieces, nephews, great-nieces and great-nephews, friends and the community of women she mentored and inspired.

2012-05-16T00:00:00Z,"An article on Sunday about college students' debt, and an accompanying chart, misstated the percentage of bachelor's degree recipients who had borrowed money for their education from the government, private lenders, or with the help of family members. The article stated that the percentage had increased to 94 percent from 45 percent in 1993, based on data from the Department of Education, whose officials reviewed The Times's methodology before publication. While the percentage of students borrowing for college has indeed increased significantly, the 94 percent figure reflected an inaccurate interpretation of the data, which came from a survey of 2007-2008 graduates. That survey showed that 66 percent of bachelor's degree recipients borrowed from the government or private lenders; an additional percentage of graduates had family members who borrowed on their behalf or who lent them money, meaning that the total percentage with college borrowing increased to more than 66 percent. But the precise figure isn't known because the department survey did not address borrowing involving family members. (The earlier survey, of 1992-1993 graduates, found that just 45 percent of graduates had borrowed from all sources, including from family members.)"

2012-05-16T00:00:00Z,"One problem with Treece, Kan., is that the ground keeps caving in. It has happened more than a hundred times over the last century. On most occasions, the subsidences -- that's what the scientists call them -- are small, like when a sofa-size crater opened up on 10th Street last year. Other times, they are much worse. In 1966, a 300-foot-wide, 200-foot-deep abyss swallowed up the road out on the edge of town. Somehow no one died. I first visited Treece in 2010. From the airport in Kansas City, it's a half-day's drive down Highway 69, the industrial sprawl giving way to fields of sunflowers and prairie grass. Then you enter a dust bowl, land so flat it's more like a dustpan -- so flat, in fact, that in 2003 researchers discovered that the entire state is flatter than an actual pancake, which the team purchased from one of the IHOPs that dot the landscape. Getting nearer to Treece, there are junk shops and single-wide trailers selling kittens and breeze-box Baptist churches with signs announcing, ''Hell Awaits.''"

2012-05-17T00:00:00Z,"IN person Matt D'Elia is a considerate conversationalist, a generous listener who makes his points enthusiastically but leaves plenty of space for a reporter's responses and rebuttals. He is, in other words, nothing like the boorish, professed philosopher he portrays in the film ''American Animal,'' a dark chamber comedy he also wrote and directed. The movie, which opens on Friday in New York, is his debut feature. It focuses on a manic young man named Jimmy who faces a terminal disease not with the usual nobility of the cinematically ill, but with an overbearing devotion to raw hedonism and self-interest. ''Jimmy is pure id,'' Mr. D'Elia said recently. ''He's a dog with thumbs.''"

The mirrorless Monochrom has a dedicated 18-megapixel image sensor that lacks a color filter array, so you can only shoot 35-millimeter black-and-white photos. But if your inner Scrooge is asking why you should spend eight grand when you can remove color after the fact, one reason is the camera's dedicated sensor, which allows the M Monochrom to pick up more light. That, and the lack of a low-pass filter, helps churn out visibly crisper images than you're bound to get through post-processing."

Devoted wife of the late Paul Sault and the late Irving Sloan, beloved mother and mother-in-law of Barbara and Michael Peterman (Cleveland, Ohio), grandmother of Lauren DeMinico (Michael), and great-grandmother of Ellie and Samantha DeMinico. Hilda was an energetic and inspirational woman who was ahead of her time. She made her mark in a man's world before it was commonplace to do so, first in business as an executive with National Silver Company during World War II and later as the founder and organizer of the Women's Division of United Cerebral Palsy (UCP). Hilda served with great distinction as President of the New York UCP Women's Division and subsequently for many years as Chair of the National UCP Women's Committee as well as a trustee and vice president for National UCP. Beginning in the 1950's she was appointed to serve on the President's Committee for the Employment of the Handicapped by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. Among her proudest accomplishments were the establishment of the national, annual UCP Telethons and the UCP/NYC Thrift Shop which raised millions of dollars for cerebral palsy. Partnering with her second husband, Irving Sloan, they opened six Sloan Fitness Centers throughout New York and Connecticut with equipment modified for use by individuals with physical disabilities. She was also active with Irving at the Southbury Training School in Danbury, Connecticut. Private graveside services will be held on Thursday, May 17. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to the New York or Cleveland offices of United Cerebral Palsy. Hilda will be fondly remembered by her family and many friends for her love of life, kindness, sophistication, warmth and generosity."

After years of finding Tyler's works lovely, funny, insightful about the details of relationships and always reliable as good books to take on vacation, I began to wonder why, for example, her characters never use obscenities or how they could stalk someone, leave a marriage or temporarily abandon their children without, seemingly, any real repercussions."

This laboratory, as Mr. Hill calls it, for small-space, sustainable and -- it must be stressed -- high-end living is the first tangible product from his fledgling company, LifeEdited. It comes with an awkward manifesto that nonetheless manages to gather an armful of social and economic trends and philosophies, including happiness research, the booming field of collaborative consumption (which uses new technology to share resources like cars, toys and books, on the Zipcar model) and data on the proven efficiencies of cities."

Most days, after a swim in the bay, I'd walk the narrow, sunny lanes and fill buckets with fat blueberries. Once a week, a club in one of the villages opened its doors early for the elementary-school set: for an hour or so, we got hopped up on soda and boogied to the Bee Gees and Donna Summer. For us, the living was easy, but this was not equally true for our mothers, many of whom were recently divorced or separated. They'd cluster together, our newly single moms, on one or another's deck and commiserate over white-wine spritzers, Dubonnet spritzers, Lillet spritzers. Melissa Manchester's rendition of ''Don't Cry Out Loud'' was a big hit back then, and to my considerable annoyance, my mother and her friends listened to it over and over, as if it gave voice to their collective grief."

The musical, adapted from Stephan Elliott's 1994 comedy ''The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' about a team of drag performers journeying through remote Australia in a camping (and camp) bus, will play its final show at the Palace Theater on June 24. The musical, which is directed by Simon Phillips and features a book by Mr. Elliott and Allan Scott as well as a score of disco-friendly pop hits, opened in March 2011 and won the Tony Award that year for its costume design by Tim Chappel and Lizzy Gardiner. Tony Sheldon, who played the role of the transsexual Bernadette - on Broadway as well as previous productions in Australia, Toronto and London's West End - was also nominated for leading actor in a musical. ''Priscilla'' will have played 23 previews and 526 performances at its closing. A spokesman for the show said that it would not recoup its capitalization costs, which totaled $15 million for the Broadway run and a pre-Broadway tryout in Toronto.

These buildings are scattered all over the city. Some date to the 1950s; others are brand-new and still looking for buyers. Some are limited to those who earn less than the median income -- 60 or 80 percent, for example (the median for a family of four in New York City is $83,000). Others have apartments for those earning a bit more than that sum.

The project has been in development for several years, but the filmmakers -- Jody Savin and Randall Miller - say they are finally set to begin filming on June 25, with Mr. Rickman taking on the part of the iconoclastic bearded, flannel-wearing bar owner who played a key role in the birth of punk and new wave music in the 1970s, providing the scarred stage where the Ramones, Television, Talking Heads, Blondie and other seminal groups got their starts."
2012-05-17T00:00:00Z,"NEW YORK likes to think of itself as being the classical music capital of the world. Yet every so often it falls off the flight path of certain eminent musicians. Cecilia Bartoli, Carlos Kleiber, Birgit Nilsson and Brigitte Fassbaender are just a few of the great artists who have skipped New York for long stretches. The same goes for the superb Nina Stemme, widely considered the world's reigning dramatic soprano. When the Swedish Ms. Stemme (pronounced (STEH-muh) made her Metropolitan Opera debut, as Senta in Wagner's ''Fliegende Holländer'' in 2000, Anthony Tommasini praised her ''cool, radiant and often penetrating sound'' in The New York Times and called her portrayal ''lustrous and winning.'' But she has logged a mere 11 New York appearances in all, having returned to the Met in 2010 for five performances of Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos''. And she won't resurface there until the 2016-17 season, when she will star in both Strauss's ''Elektra'' and a new Willy Decker production of Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde.''"

The interview, conducted on Tuesday by Russiya 24, a Russia state television station, was Mr. Assad's first since December. It suggested he had hardened longstanding views about his adversaries in the face of escalating international pressure.

The August closing date had been something of a spurious notion ever since ''Newsies'' - about a group of New York City newspaper hawkers on strike against a media baron at the turn of the 20th century - started setting box-office records in April at the Nederlander Theater. Yet Disney Theatrical Productions has tried to manage expectations about the musical from the get-go since it was not developed to be a big Broadway show. It was intended to be a licensable title for regional theaters and schools until several critics raved about its debut last fall at Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J.; that production transferred largely intact to Broadway."

2012-05-17T00:00:00Z,"THE British writer Simon Gray died in 2008 after a long life of writing and smoking, smoking and writing. His prolific output included more than 30 plays as well as novels, screenplays and a series of memoirs collectively entitled ''The Smoking Diaries.'' But Gray never really made much of a mark in the United States. Only three of his plays made it to Broadway, the most celebrated being ''Butley,'' revived in 2006 with Nathan Lane in the lead. A new production of his popular 1984 play, ''THE COMMON PURSUIT,'' gives audiences a chance to reassess his talent. Originally directed by Harold Pinter, a longtime collaborator and friend, the play is a generational comedy-drama that follows the lives of a half-dozen Cambridge students through two decades as they move through the worlds of literary London. The title refers to the literary magazine founded by one of the characters at school, and is a homage to a volume of essays by the esteemed British critic F. R. Leavis. Moisés Kaufman (''Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo,'' ''33 Variations'') directs the new production for the Roundabout Theater Company.

2012-05-17T00:00:00Z,"The Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman,'' starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, will recoup its $3.1 million capitalization this week, just 14 weeks into its run, the producers said on Wednesday. That is a notably swift achievement for a show that has seven performances a week instead of the standard eight. Those missing performances translated into more than $1 million in unrealized revenue, based on an analysis of the ticket sale grosses for the show; it grossed $9.8 million in its first 13 weeks. The producers have been able to charge a top price of $425 for the best seats in the theater, an almost unheard-of amount for a play and almost as much as the hit musical ''Book of Mormon,'' where tickets top out at $477. ''Mormon'' and ''Salesman'' have a lead producer in common, Scott Rudin. ''Salesman'' has broken the box office record six times at its home, the Barrymore Theater. Only about 30 percent of Broadway shows recoup capitalization costs and turn a profit."

Born in Flushing, Queens in 1932 and a graduate of Barnard College, she lived a peripatetic adult life from Great Neck, NY to Boca Raton, FL and Manchester, VT as well as London and Rome. Her family remembers her as a devoted friend, mother, sister, sister-in-law, aunt and Granny. She is survived by her sons Robert and Peter; her four grandchildren, Sydney, Alyssa, Samuel and Eden; her sisters, Myrna and Dedee; her sister-in-law, Connie; her brothers-in-law Albert and Arthur; her nieces Leslie, Melissa, Donna, Stephanie; and her nephews Bill, Jeffrey, Ken, Jonathan and David. She was passionate about the arts, especially the contemporary arts, classical music and opera. She founded classical music festivals in Boca Raton, FL and Manchester, VT. She served on the Visiting Committee for the Arts at Williams College. She enriched the lives of all her knew her in countless ways with her wise counsel. We celebrate a life well lived and will forever feel her presence. Services will be private but donations in her memory can be made to the Eaglebrook School in Deerfield, MA."

After a big greeting at the door and several rounds of complimentary drinks, the man, in a blue custom-made suit, continued down to West 16th Street. Stepping out at the Dream Downtown, he pushed past a crowd and, like a fighting cock let loose in an arena, crowed out ''Aalex Julian!'' to the head doorman (who did not seem pleased to see him) and tossed a pink paisley pocket square onto Mr. Julian's bald head. Mr. Julian removed it and stuffed it back into the young man's mouth, who then bit his finger."

He is survived by his son, Christopher, his wife Julia (Ware) and his two grandchildren, Rebecca L. and Deland L. His family spent summers in Brielle, sailing the boats he had built in the Manasquan River. When the war began, he was working for Federal Ship and volunteered for the Navy. After OCS, he was sent to California by the Navy for his experience in shipbuilding. With a passion for sailing that he had developed as a young boy, he opted to remain in California where he could sail year round. He obtained a General Contractor's license, built several houses, and worked in the aerospace industry in production control, where he was involved in the Apollo Project. An avid reader with wide-ranging interests, he was a great conversationalist and the fundamental source for our family's background and the history of the Wing & Son Piano Company. He could build anything and had an instinctive feel for how to make a boat sail fast. Happy sailing, Dad!"

Set before me by our sweet-natured waiter, a flute of brisk prosecco arrived with a tiny orange nasturtium bobbing on top. ''You can eat that,'' he said, smiling. I did, at once, and a peppery snap of flower power turned an everyday aperitif into a charming opening act. Matt Hudson and Amy Lehman, who have owned the Hudson House for 22 years, gave it a face-lift and a tummy tuck over the winter: they replaced old wooden beams with steel and laid new oak floors; a fresh coat of gold-and-white pearlized paint on the ornate pressed-tin walls and ceiling gives the place a distinctive sheen, the decorative equivalent of a satin prom dress. A beautiful, muted wall-length mural of the Hudson River and white tablecloths lend a bit of formality."

2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"Antigovernment anger in Syria escalated on Friday over the harsh repression of students in Aleppo, the country's largest city, where activists reported what they called the most extensive protests there yet in the 15-month-old nationwide uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Many thousands of demonstrators, including some government loyalists, participated in the protests, according to dispatches by activists and witnesses interviewed by telephone. Sympathy protests for victims of the crackdown on the students were also reported in several other Syrian cities in what organizers called ''the heroes of Aleppo University'' demonstrations, and in some cases they were broken up by security forces using live ammunition."
2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY -- The federal government paid New York State $700 million more in 2009 than the state needed to care for residents with developmental disabilities who lived in its institutions, according to the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington. The finding suggested that billions of dollars earmarked for institutional care in New York had been used for other purposes over the last several years. No penalty is recommended, however, because the payments were approved by federal regulators."
2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"It was my first day of practice with Santo André and I sat quietly on the team bus, staring out the window as we rode to a practice center. I had no idea where we were going or what kind of soccer I was in store for. As the bus veered through the winding hills and favelas of São Paulo, one of Brazil's largest cities, I truly wondered what was ahead of me. Having graduated from Princeton in 2006, I was now in the second year of my quest to become a professional soccer player. I spent most of 2007 in San Francisco, playing in the United Soccer Leagues Premier Development League, a minor league circuit equivalent to Class AA baseball, and then working out for some lower-division clubs in England."
2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"As Wal-Mart reported higher-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Thursday, it suggested in a regulatory filing that the scope of an internal investigation into bribery accusations had widened beyond the retailer's subsidiary in Mexico. The company reported that the audit committee of the Wal-Mart Stores board was examining possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and ''other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México.'' It was the first public disclosure by the company that the internal inquiry could involve additional subsidiaries, though none was named."
2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"The Royalty At every turn on ''Lovers'' (Victory), Nicole Boudreau, the frontwoman of the Royalty, has a whip-smart come-on, a delicately phrased look into her own psyche. ''Take me away with your old-school tunes/I'll be Aretha/Oh, Otis, make my heart swoon,'' she sings powerfully on ''Bartender.'' On ''How I Like 'Em,'' she tells us: ''Everyone warned me, I didn't listen/Just seems like the rebels are better at kissing.'' Ms. Boudreau is a chipper and sly songwriter, and she always sounds cheeky, like a flexible Dusty Springfield, putting her leaps ahead of more serious-minded white soul singers. Better still, she's backed by a collection of electric players: Jesus Apodaca on guitar, Will Daugherty on bass, Daniel Marin Jr. on keyboards and Joel Quintana on drums. Often reminiscent of the Gaslight Anthem, another group that meshes fervent soul, classic rock storytelling and impressive band dynamics, the Royalty is both ragged and hospital-corners tight. Its blend of the acumen of the Dap-Kings and the detached affect of the Strokes is invigorating and fresh, making for one of the year's most unexpected and enjoyable rock records."
2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"Relatives who are a little too close; a suffocating sense of limits; secrets that, once shared, undo the precepts that defined a way of life: If these sound like elements in a family's deconstruction -- the stuff, say, of a Sam Shepard play -- they certainly could be. But Tom Dudzick's ''Miracle on South Division Street,'' at St. Luke's Theater, is a sprightly, gentle comedy, where revelations that might remake a family's sense of itself are each rolled out in service of laughter."
2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON -- It says something about American politics that it has come to this: For the record, Bill Clinton does not actually support Mitt Romney for president no matter how many times Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, cites him in his speeches. And for that matter, just for clarity, Ronald Reagan certainly would not be supporting President Obama, either."
2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"ATHENS -- Political and economic tremors rolled out of Greece and across Europe again on Thursday as the caretaker prime minister, Panagiotis Pikrammenos, appointed a temporary cabinet to manage the country's affairs until June 17, when the second general election in a little more than a month is held. An increasingly urgent question is whether Europe can afford to wait until that election, which is expected to determine the future of the troubled country in the euro zone and the broader stability of the bloc. Events may force European officials' hand much earlier."

2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"Robert Frost once likened working without form to playing tennis without a net. By this logic, working with two forms could be seen as playing with dual nets: double the chance for winners, and unforced errors. This is the exacting, dizzying game played by Annie-B Parson and Paul Lazar -- one for each net -- of Big Dance Theater. They've been at it a long time, splicing dance and theater. But still it bears remarking upon; there are remarkably few artists who do it half as well as this influential duo."
2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"As a child growing up in a tiny, German-speaking village in Romania, on the edge of Transylvania, Herta Müller was assigned chores that included herding cows. Out in the pastures with little to do, she amused herself by giving names and personalities to the flowers she collected and the clouds that drifted by, or imagined a future as a seamstress, like her aunt, or perhaps as a hairdresser. But a career as a writer, much less one who would win the Nobel Prize in Literature? She could not imagine such a thing, living as she did in linguistic isolation and under surveillance as part of a suspect German minority under the drab Communist dictatorship that came to be ruled by the megalomaniacal Nicolae Ceausescu."

And yet, one shot continues to vex and perplex him. It is not Zdeno Chara's 108.8-mile-per-hour slap shot. Or a Steven Stamkos one-timer. Or an Alexander Semin wrister. The shot that frustrates Brodeur barely even touches the stick, and that is on purpose."
2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"SEVILLE, SPAIN -- More than six months ago, a 37-year-old worker here named Juan was laid off from his job delivering and assembling furniture for customers of Ikea, joining the legions of unemployed in Spain. Or so it would seem. Since then, Juan has continued doing more or less the same work. But instead of doing it on the payroll of Pantoja, a transport subcontractor to Ikea, he hovers around the parking lot of the megastore, luring customers of his own by offering not only to deliver their furniture but also to do ''general work,'' like painting and repairs, all for the bargain price of 40, or $51, a day."
2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"GREENSBORO, N.C. -- John Edwards has been a United States senator and a presidential candidate and has fathered five children.

2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"AS a pacifist I never imagined that a violent sport like boxing could offer me anything. What I didn't know was that a boxer's training, repurposed for fitness, could make for a safe and dynamic exercise program. Two weeks at a gym devoted solely to fitness boxing, Aerospace High Performance Center in the West Village, taught me that much. I had never thrown a serious punch in my life until my first workout in the most hands-on class offered, Aeroimpact. After having my hands wrapped and gloved, Michael Olajide Jr. ran me through the basics: jab, uppercut, hook and power punch. Mr. Olajide is a 48-year-old former middleweight champion who had been teaching similar classes for about a decade before opening the gym in 2005."

For the next half a decade, there almost wasn't a nightclub in America that didn't play Ms. Summer's songs or anyone who came of age during the disco era who won't forever associate her with that hedonistic time."

A former warehouse worker, he commutes to BNN's headquarters in Fort Lee from the Trenton area. From the office, it can be a five-minute drive over the George Washington Bridge to Manhattan, but Mr. Crockman has never made that drive.

But while enjoying that return to America as it was, you may also be struck by how often this half-century-old black-and-white television series tackled issues that seem very 21st century. ''Route 66,'' which ran from 1960 to 1964 on CBS, was an earnest, ambitious serial about two young men on a random journey across North America in a Corvette. It was shot on location, something hard to imagine given the bulkiness of equipment at the time. Viewed today, a scene on a shrimp boat in New Orleans or at the half-built Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona prompts admiration for the producers, camera operators, electricians and others who made the shots feasible."

Since last year, the Florida Division of Elections had sought access to the immigration database, which is maintained by the Department of Homeland Security, but the department said there were legal and technical difficulties in sharing the information."

It was a question not just of taste, but of identity, she said, as her love of electronic dance music faced off against a deeper, almost maternal tug of straight-up rock. ''My friends are torn between the two, a lot of us are,'' said Ms. Pollack, 24, of West Long Branch, N.J. ''I may like the music better at Electric Daisy Carnival, but I don't want to pass up a festival on the beach.

Yes, Daniel was black and I was white -- a British Jamaican and an American half-Jew, respectively -- and yes, I suspected that we would have cute kids. But her well-intentioned e-mail made me roll my eyes. It was hard to imagine commenting to a white couple that their future children would be attractive simply because you'd seen some other white parents with a good-looking child."

As most of the audience recognized from the name alone, the show was a translation of Arthur Miller's drama ''Death of a Salesman.'' It seemed a mere footnote to the premiere production, which had completed its triumphal run on Broadway several months earlier, having won the Pulitzer Prize. Even so, a theater critic in Commentary magazine, George Ross, declared of the Brooklyn version, ''What one feels most strikingly is that this Yiddish play is really the original, and the Broadway production was merely Arthur Miller's translation into English.''"

But Lopate himself originally wanted to be a novelist or poet, he told us via e-mail. ''It took me a while to fall in love with essays,'' he said. ''Then I saw that I could combine story/telling and character from fiction, and associative leaps and consciousness tracking from poetry, and put them all together in one flexible form. In my early 30s I stumbled on the great 19th-century English essayist William Hazlitt, who turned me on to Charles Lamb and Michel de Montaigne, and from that point I was hooked.'' The essay, Lopate said, is ''the intellectual bellwether of any society. But it always has to squeeze its way into the canon, in the cracks left over from fiction and poetry. The funny thing is that people really like to read essays, only they don't always realize that's what they're reading; they think they're taking in articles or simply interesting nonfiction. They associate essays negatively with argument-driven college compositions they were required to write.''"

Yet there is occasionally truth in even the subterfuges of advertising. And as it happens, the publicized title is an accurate description for the experience of this feisty, hypnotic and oddly energizing exercise in emotional carnage, which has been directed (by James Macdonald) and acted (by a four-member ensemble) with a brute focus that suggests to-the-death battles of penned animals."

The real problem with citizenship laws is not their manipulation by lawmakers or entrepreneurs, much less by mythical ''anchor babies.''

In recent years some producers opted not to mount national tours of hit Broadway plays, concluding that the tours would not run enough weeks in North American cities to guarantee a profit. In 2010, for instance, the producers of the Tony-winning commercial hit ''God of Carnage'' decided that a tour of the show was not financially worthwhile.

Some players wore neon spandex, others donned plastic shades, one man enveloped himself in a red boxing robe that concealed white short-shorts. Their goal: to hold a table-tennis tournament against the walls of the Bank of America building. Friday's table-tennis face-off was part of the Midtown Games, the work of the New York-based artist Zefrey Throwell. His previous work has included a seven-day public strip poker game, a 1,000 ''car horn symphony'' and a year of living in 12 New York apartments ''designed to get me outside of my routine.''"

This is no time to mince words: Her one-size-fits-all austerity program has been a failure, pushing heavily indebted countries deeper into recession, making it even harder for them to pay off their debts. It is putting the already-weak recovery in the United States at risk and is fueling instability and extremism in Europe. After months of obstinance, Ms. Merkel has softened her stance -- saying that Germany is open to stimulus to spur growth, employment and development in Greece and pledging to work with the new French president, François Hollande, on a program to promote growth across recession-racked Europe. It is unclear, however, whether her comments reflect a true and lasting change of heart."

Labor Department figures indicate that the percentage of workers over the traditional retirement age of 65 is at a record high. But, the figures show, job totals fell sharply for men under 55 during the recession and have only started to recover, while the proportion of women ages 25 to 54 with jobs also slid and is close to the lowest level of the last two decades."

I can't imagine that's a coincidence. It may be a subliminal thing. I would be foolish to say that that year wasn't significant. And I have sometimes thought that because my father died when I was 16 that I write in a way that's compensatory, that I write into a void that I never experienced. I've written two or three stories about boys and girls who have parents at age 16 and go on having parents at age 16 and what happens subsequent to that. Tell me about the day your father died. I remember being waked up on a Saturday morning by my father gasping for breath in the next room. My mother was trying to wake him up by shaking him, and she was saying his name, ''Carrol, Carrol.'' He kept having these big upheaval gasps, and I got into the bed with him and breathed in his mouth to perform some kind of resuscitative magic, but I think he was dead. My mother became hysterical at that point."

Ms. Mattila, right, was to have sung the role of Amelia. ''Karita was engaged for 'Ballo' five years ago, and she recently decided the role was not right for her,'' said a Met spokeswoman, Lee Abrahamian. Sondra Radvanovsky will take on all but 1 of the 10 Amelia performances, the Met said, with the other replacement to be determined. As part of the domino effect in opera casting Ms. Radvanovsky stepped out of four performances of Verdi's ''Trovatore,'' and Carmen Giannattasio will take over for her. Ms. Radvanovsky was also released by the Met from her contract to sing Elisabeth de Valois in Verdi's ''Don Carlo'' in February and March because she now needs more time to prepare for future roles, the company said. No replacement was named. The announcements were part of a barrage of cast comings and goings for next year. The Met also said that Erwin Schrott would sing Dulcamara in Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore,'' a new production of the opera directed by Bartlett Sher, and that Dolora Zajick would replace Olga Borodina in three performances of ''Aida.''

2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"My audiobook listening takes place during my morning exercise, which means I spend a good seven hours a week listening to books -- far more of them, in fact, than I read in print these days. If you'd encountered me on the street recently, you might have seen me trotting along, laughing aloud to David Sedaris's ''Barrel Fever'' or Tina Fey's ''Bossypants,'' or crying -- yes, real tears and grimaces, I have to admit -- to the ending of ''The Mill on the Floss.'' My neighbors either don't notice or are too kind to mention my seeming emotional instability. But if somebody's going to spend 10 or 20 hours in my ears, turning me into a local jogging spectacle, I'd better enjoy the experience. That means, of course, picking the right books to listen to. It also means listening to the right reader. Edward Herrmann did a great job with Laura Hillenbrand's ''Unbroken,'' but I don't want to hear his interpretation of ''Barrel Fever.'' Well, maybe a little, but I'm weird. Narration is, not surprisingly, an essential part of the experience. However, apart from Jim Dale, who has employed his hundreds of voices for the phenomenally successful series of Harry Potter novels, audiobook performers are little known outside of the community of devoted listeners."

2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"These are challenging times for cinephiles. The sanctity of our natural habitat -- the movie theater -- is disappearing amid the dynamite blasts of lighted phones while people text and tweet in the dark; the chain-saw buzz of disruptive conversation; and the slow erosion of common courtesy in communal spaces. As a committed moviegoer who once treasured the cathedral-like atmosphere of the movie house, I now find myself entering the auditorium anticipating a bad experience -- sitting and nervously profiling every person who walks into the theater for their yet-to-be-committed misdemeanors. (Is he a talker? She definitely looks like a texter.) In fact, given the round-the-clock accessibility of movies, the advent of oversize HDTV screens and the quality of high-end home-theater sound systems, it's more and more tempting just to hunker down and erect a cinematic temple in your own home. But there is still one event that makes it worthwhile to trek out to the theater; a ritual that represents for me a near-ideal cinematic experience."

But the quiet atmosphere leaves me time to relax, read the newspaper and collect my thoughts. This occasional daytime stop of mine is the antithesis of Elaine's, the legendary Upper East Side nightspot, which was down the block from Osha and where I used to hang out, until it shut one year ago this month. I didn't walk into Osha until I happened upon it after Elaine's had closed, and yet I never would have found it had it not been for Elaine's."

He began to make a lot of money, enough to finance his own private utopia in Giverny in northern France, where he devoted himself to flower gardening with as much industry and creativity as he did to painting. From 1883 to the end of his life in 1926, initially as a renter, he presided over his aesthetic Eden, his paradise for the innocent eye, and there created some of the most adventurous works on canvas of the early 20th century: the enveloping, hallucinatory paintings of lily pads floating on the surface of the pond he excavated for them. In multitudes of old photographs he appears as a figure of Tolstoyan rusticity in baggy work clothes, wide-brimmed hat and voluminous beard, along with members of his extensive family, his staff of five gardeners and guests who came from all over the world to see his gardens and pay obeisance to his transcendental greatness."

(13) THE ENCHANTED ISLAND Combining music by Handel, Vivaldi, Rameau and lesser-known composers, and with a new English-language libretto by Jeremy Sams that draws on Shakespeare's ''Tempest'' and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' this pastiche was first imagined by Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, who said ''he wanted to 'play the Baroque card' at the Met in a fresh way,'' Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times. William Christie conducts a cast including Danielle de Niese, Joyce DiDonato, David Daniels, Plácido Domingo (above, with Ms. de Niese) and Luca Pisaroni. The scenic designer Julian Crouch blended 18th-century theatrical techniques with video projections. And Phelim McDermott directed this production, originally shown in movie theaters on Jan. 21 and presented here by ''Great Performances at the Met.'' ''This project could easily have resulted in a gimmicky piece with a mashed-up score,'' Mr. Tommasini wrote. ''But Mr. Sams, who is a writer, director, translator and film composer, saw both the potential humor and the richness in the idea.''

A few filmmakers have made the theme a personal specialty -- most notably in our time Quentin Tarantino (with the Wagnerian sprawl of his two-part ''Kill Bill''), and in the classical past, Fritz Lang, who pursued the theme both in his German films (the second part of his 1924 telling of the Siegfried saga was titled ''Kriemhild's Revenge'') and in Hollywood (his first American film, the 1936 ''Fury,'' stars Spencer Tracy as a man who survives a lynching attempt and returns to settle the score with the small-town mob that tried to kill him)."

Instead they were in Jay's garage-turned-office in Los Angeles, preparing for a sound-looping session for their microbudget movie, ''The Do-Deca-Pentathlon,'' and generally acting like stoned teenagers in faded black jeans. Jay rooted through cardboard boxes, searching for microphones. Mark watched, strumming an acoustic guitar. They called each other ''Dupes'' a lot, a variation on Duplass that they stole from a friend. Together, the Dupes have directed five feature films in seven years, including ''The Puffy Chair,'' ''Cyrus'' and ''Jeff, Who Lives at Home.'' This year alone, there were three Duplass-connected films at the Sundance festival: Mark acted in ''Safety Not Guaranteed'' and ''Your Sister's Sister'' and wrote the script for ''Black Rock,'' directed by and starring his wife, Katie Aselton.

The couple had taken a train from Massachusetts; they moved there from Greenwich Village a year and a half ago, partly for the change of scenery after he left New York University. And partly because of what was happening to Mr. Goffman. In the waiting room, he stood up and asked a receptionist where his wife had gone. Then he left. Nobody stopped him, perhaps because he was, in a way, wearing a disguise. He looked perfectly normal."

To that end, Mr. Carter generously helped four longtime residents direct their own short films, weaving the results into a larger survey of pioneering grit and love of the land. Though not much to look at, these brief glimpses of soul-and-soil connection -- a sheepherder watching his lambs gambol, a young resident explaining how a favorite mountain nurtures prayer -- unfold with heartfelt simplicity. Thanks to them, we begin to see why a local sheriff's deputy loves her ''incredible little valley.''"

My parents always reminded me of this the way other Berkeley parents reminded kids about how their entire family was once tear-gassed during an antiwar march. I took my first dinner date to Chez Panisse, at 13. I celebrated my wedding engagement there at 32. After my first child was born, I learned to cook by making nearly every recipe in eight Chez Panisse cookbooks. This took years and made Waters into a culinary mother-angel ever-present in my thoughts and kitchen."

In November, North Korea reported brisk progress in the building of a small light water reactor in its main nuclear complex in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, its capital.

2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"The official title for the ritualistic, immersive, often breathtaking solo piano concert at the Harlem Stage Gatehouse on Thursday was ''An Intimate Evening With Cecil Taylor.'' Hmm, intimate -- I'm not so sure about that. True, there was a striking proximity to the audience in the performance, which had Mr. Taylor, the stouthearted patriarch of free-improvisation, seated at a Bosendorfer piano within seven or eight feet of the nearest listener. And yes, the sound in the room was vivid and pristine, with only the subtlest hint of amplification. But the nature of Mr. Taylor's art is formal and unaccommodating; you might sooner extract intimacy from a Gerhard Richter painting. The intensity of his contact with the piano, and the fullness of his commitment to the moment, imposes a distance between him and his audience. I've heard him in clubs, in concert and outdoors, and that part of the experience always holds true. He works inside a force field, imperturbable and sovereign. Whatever connection you make with his music, you make within yourself."

2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"Before the modern dummy was invented, crash-testing relied on cadavers, animals, sandbags and the occasional human volunteer. In 1949, Maj. J. P. Stapp, an Air Force flight surgeon studying the ''physiology of rapid deceleration,'' wanted to test his rocket sled on something resembling a human. He commissioned a dummy based on plaster casts of an actual pilot. A California firm called Sierra Engineering responded with Sierra Sam, a six-foot-tall steel-and-rubber dummy with instruments in his thorax and head. Soon, it became apparent that such a dummy could have a big impact on the auto industry. With the birth of the Interstate, in 1956, Americans began driving longer distances in bigger and more powerful cars, increasing concerns about safety. In 1965, Ralph Nader published ''Unsafe at Any Speed,'' and the following year Congress passed the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. The same year, the engineer Samuel Alderson, who studied physics under J. Robert Oppenheimer, built the first dummy designed for the automotive industry. He called it V.I.P. For more accurate testing, General Motors put a Sierra dummy's head onto V.I.P.'s body to create the Hybrid I dummy in 1971. In the '80s, Vince and Larry -- third-generation Hybrids -- appeared on TV to urge Americans to buckle up. They're now in the Smithsonian."

Now, with the 80th-anniversary season of the festival nigh, comes the celebratory documentary ''Never Stand Still,'' which looks at Jacob's Pillow from its beginnings with the choreographer Ted Shawn. His Men Dancers troupe aimed, from 1933, to present a muscular, masculine presence in dance.

He had been invited to New York last year to work with Beyoncé. The first day had gone well. But that night, ''I got in a fight here,'' he said, gesturing at the bar. ''I got arrested, and I think they kind of lost interest in me or something, because I didn't show up for the second day of the sessions.''"

The screening had been a live broadcast of the Royal Ballet's production of Frederick Ashton's ''Fille Mal Gardée,'' at the Royal Opera House in London, and his remark brought back the many different combinations of joy and wonder that this ballet has given me over the decades. Could that man have enjoyed it as much as I? When I first saw ''La Fille,'' at a dress rehearsal of a 1975 revival with Rudolf Nureyev, it amazed me: I had not known that ballet could be so innocent, so funny and so irresistible. Afterward, on the London Underground, my feet would not keep still; they were remembering the clog dance performed by the heroine's mother, Widow Simone (a role played by a man, in British pantomime-dame fashion)."

2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"FOR the last seven years, John Frame has been working on a film in his home in Wrightwood, Calif. Its cast includes a cockeyed skeleton, a bespectacled monkey and a horned man sporting a cloak adorned with eyeballs. Mr. Frame made all of the characters himself out of wood and found objects, built the sets, even composed the score. When he discovered that his characters were going ''wherever they wanted to go,'' he let them. For the first four years of the project, he worked completely alone, driven by what may have been a muse or ''daemons,'' he's unsure which; not even his closest friends and colleagues knew what he was up to. Mr. Frame is part of an underground group of stop-motion artists in Southern California who labor in the shadows of the major studios. Long the center of studio-backed stop-motion animation made by artists like Ray Harryhausen and Art Clokey, the area is now home to scores of solo practitioners more interested in creating highly personal art pieces than commercial works. This year looks to be a strong one for stop-motion features, with big-budget releases including Sony Pictures' ''The Pirates!

2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"In 2008, this paper published a story about Joyce Maynard's house on a lake in Guatemala. It was an ''escape from all that'' story, a celebration of the ability to start one's life anew in midlife with limited means but abundant vigor. Friends of mine, trapped in their aging urban routines, still refer to the story, four years on, when fantasizing about the lives not led. It was that intoxicating. So it is with a little sadness but great pleasure that we bring you, in this issue, an update from Maynard on that lake house. For a variety of reasons -- environmental, artificial and, perhaps, prophetic -- the property seems likely to be under water soon. A writer's retreat and her nest egg will be gone. Maynard beautifully describes the process of letting go of her house, of retaining the value of its passing existence as its actual value literally disappears."

Two days later, the House made it clear it considered those to be petty concerns, voting to keep the repellent practice of indefinite detention on the books. On a 238-to-182 vote, it rejected a proposal for something so basic that it is hard to believe there was an argument about it: a formal charge and trial for anyone arrested in the United States. You might have thought that was guaranteed in the Constitution, but that right was stripped away in last year's military policy bill, signed by President Obama, which made an exception for terror suspects. By giving the military the power to deal with domestic terrorists, the bill essentially allowed presidents to brand anyone a terrorist and lock them up for life without a trial."

2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"In 1953, after the early successes of Soviet espionage demonstrated just how difficult and dangerous the cold war would become, the Central Intelligence Agency began a top-secret program called MKUltra. It included exotic projects that decades later provided much critical fodder for commentators and comedians: exploding cigars, poison-laced toothpaste, hallucinogenic serums. And as we learn in a video interview with professional spies at the exhibition ''Spy: The Secret World of Espionage,'' opening on Friday at Discovery Times Square, it even included the hiring of a magician, John Mulholland, as a C.I.A. consultant. And why not? Spend some time here and you can feel as if you'd been admitted to the backstage preparations for a magic show. The difference is that in espionage, life or death and the fate of nations are at stake, rather than whether a woman can be successfully sawed in half or an ace of spades pulled from a shuffled deck. These magicians weren't performing; they were dueling."
2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,"Several miles west of Kabul, the village Qala-e Naw sits deep in the barren foothills of barrener mountains that are perennially half-sunk in cloud. The ruins of old homes strafed by Soviet gunships crowd a gravel streambed that is dry most of the year but runs swiftly with snowmelt come spring. One morning early in December, a 12-year-old girl named Gulali followed the bed for almost an hour, along with her mother and little sister, in search of dry timber to fuel their stove. When they reached a steep rise with scattered saplings near its peak, Gulali scrambled up the slope and set to hacking at some of the skinnier trunks with a hatchet. In the small community of poor Pashtun farmers who inhabit Qala-e Naw, Gulali was well liked for her prideful and precocious work ethic, and true to form, when her mother said they had enough wood and it was time to go home, Gulali insisted on felling one last tree. Seconds later, she stepped on a land mine. The explosion hurled her through the air, nearly severing her right leg and pulverizing most of the left. Gulali's mother ran to her and began to stanch the hemorrhaging stump with a head scarf. Two of Gulali's uncles, Pasha and Sartor, were working a field about a mile away when they heard the explosion and saw the brown plume drift and dissipate. It took Sartor, the younger one, more than 30 minutes to reach the scene, and when he arrived, he found Gulali cradled in her mother's arms. Sartor put his niece over his shoulder and ran back to where Pasha and a group of nomadic herdsmen were waiting. An old shepherd offered his winter shawl, which Pasha and Sartor used as a makeshift litter to carry Gulali another 20 minutes to the nearest Afghan Police post. Gulali, who remained conscious the entire time, never made a sound. When she was 6, she fell down a 30-foot well that was dry at the bottom. Her father found her hours later, both of her legs broken. He had to climb down a ladder and lash her to his back with a rope to get her out. During that ordeal as well, her father told me, Gulali remained spookily calm."

2012-05-19T00:00:00Z,"The Jets continued their off-season overhaul at safety Friday, signing the veteran Yeremiah Bell to a one-year deal worth $1.4 million. Bell, who spent the previous eight seasons with the Miami Dolphins, provides the Jets with a durable, in-the-box safety who is regarded more for his run defense than his pass coverage. The 34-year-old Bell, released by the Dolphins for salary-cap reasons, started 63 of Miami's last 64 regular-season games and led the team in tackles in each of the last four years. In 2011, Bell had 107 tackles, 2 sacks and an interception. With Eric Smith and LaRon Landry, signed as a free agent in March, projected to start for the Jets, it is unlikely that Bell approaches those statistics again this season. But he supplies valuable depth at a position that lacked consistency in 2011 and that lost its primary backup, Brodney Pool, to a free-agent deal in Dallas."

2012-05-19T00:00:00Z,"THE first time I'd ever heard that there were video previews for books was when I was told I had to make one. A few months before my own book was to be released, my publisher advised me that official book trailers were now routinely posted on YouTube as a promotional device. I was skeptical, but remembering how instrumental video was in advancing the career of Men Without Hats, I acquiesced. The first script I submitted was reverse-engineered from a survey of viral videos: it featured a hot girl, my cat, a catchy song and a child being humiliated. It was ix-nayed without much discussion -- presumably because it was not remotely SFW -- so I dutifully wrote a more conventional version whose only concession to plebeian taste was a brief image of Ulysses S. Grant in drag. Filming this video was not exactly grueling, since it forced my friend and co-star Boyd to visit me in New York and required us to drink free beer before noon. My own reaction on seeing the final cut was to contemplate, for the first time in my life, getting cosmetic surgery, but people who've seen it tell me it's funny and melancholic and successfully conveys the spirit of the book. I now have hopes, I think not wholly unjustified, of joining that pantheon shared by the Star Wars Kid, Obama Girl and the internationally renowned cat Maru."

2012-05-19T00:00:00Z,"Chen Guangcheng, the blind legal advocate who recently sought refuge in the American Embassy in Beijing, arrived in the heart of Greenwich Village on Saturday, holding the kind of open-air news conference that he could have never imagined while under virtual house arrest in China. After a daylong and hastily arranged flight from Beijing, Mr. Chen stood on crutches -- with a lawyer at his side and facing spectators cordoned off by the police -- and addressed a throng of reporters. He said he was grateful to the American Embassy and the Chinese government, which allowed him to leave China, and thanked Chinese officials for ''dealing with the situation with restraint and calm.''"
2012-05-19T00:00:00Z,"I'VE been running for almost two years, ever since I lost almost 100 pounds. Another runner, Richard O'Brien, once said: ''Running is not, as it so often seems, only about what you did in your last race or about how many miles you ran last week. It is, in a much more important way, about community, about appreciating all the miles run by other runners, too.'' That sums it up for me. Running helps me keep the weight off, but there's something about training in a group -- especially in a group you work with -- that's invaluable."
2012-05-19T00:00:00Z,"I WAS traveling last week on my book tour and landed at the John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Calif.

I called the car service. The dispatcher said: ''Go outside the terminal to the curb. Your driver is there.'' I went to the curb. Still no driver. After 10 minutes I called back, and the dispatcher said, ''I talked to the driver, he's circling the airport.''"

''Water by the Spoonful'' had its premiere last October at Hartford Stage, which commissioned the play. It is the second in a trilogy that began with Ms. Hudes's ''Elliot, a Soldier's Fugue,'' about a young Marine coming to terms with his time in Iraq and his father's and grandfather's service in Vietnam and Korea. The third play, ''The Happiest Song Plays Last,'' is to make its debut at the Goodman Theater in Chicago in 2013."

In the Geffen's world-premiere production of ''The Exorcist,'' Ms. Shields, who recently starred in ''The Addams Family'' on Broadway, will play Chris MacNeil, an actress whose daughter, Regan, develops a mysterious ailment whose origins turn out to be much darker than science can contemplate. Mr. Chamberlain, a star of ''The Thorn Birds'' on television and Broadway revivals of ''My Fair Lady'' and ''The Sound of Music,'' will play Father Merrin, the veteran demon-chaser who comes to the aid of the MacNeils.

Daughter of the late Jack and Marion Baum of New Orleans. Yvonne died peacefully at home after a long, courageous fight with cancer spanning nine years, during which she never lost her vitality, good humor, and fighting spirit. Her extraordinary physical beauty was fully matched by her beauty of heart, mind, and spirit. Yvonne graduated from Sophie Newcomb College, and did graduate work in psychology at the New School, earning her Masters, and completing all the course work for her Phd. She did clinical work and taught at Hunter College. After a successful career working for various social services agencies, her determined activism led her to not-for-profit work and philanthropy, serving as Board Chairman for Givat Haviva Educational Foundation and recently as a Trustee for The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. She never flagged in her devotion to trying to make the world better, and in her support for a humane and just Israel. Still, her heart was most dedicated to her beloved family and enormous circle of devoted friends, who saw in her an inspiring example of life lived to the fullest, and for whom she was an irreplaceable loving presence. Donations may be made to Givat Haviva or The Washington Institute, or one's own choice of charity. A private funeral will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York."

There, he becomes involved in a tense confrontation with Amy's old beau Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard), and his gun-toting, Lynyrd Skynyrd-loving friends. David tries to compromise and adapt to their ways. But soon he has no choice but to fight back.

Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''But like its predecessor, Mr. Lurie's 'Straw Dogs' is more overtly about sexual politics: about the meaning of manhood than about ideology, class or cultural differences.''

2012-05-19T00:00:00Z,"AMID the ceaseless and cacophonous debates about how to close the achievement gap, we've turned away from one tool that has been shown to work: school desegregation. That strategy, ushered in by the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, has been unceremoniously ushered out, an artifact in the museum of failed social experiments. The Supreme Court's ruling that racially segregated schools were ''inherently unequal'' shook up the nation like no other decision of the 20th century. Civil rights advocates, who for years had been patiently laying the constitutional groundwork, cheered to the rafters, while segregationists mourned ''Black Monday'' and vowed ''massive resistance.'' But as the anniversary was observed this past week on May 17, it was hard not to notice that desegregation is effectively dead. In fact, we have been giving up on desegregation for a long time. In 1974, the Supreme Court rejected a metropolitan integration plan, leaving the increasingly black cities to fend for themselves. A generation later, public schools that had been ordered to integrate in the 1960s and 1970s became segregated once again, this time with the blessing of a new generation of justices. And five years ago, a splintered court delivered the coup de grâce when it decreed that a school district couldn't voluntarily opt for the most modest kind of integration -- giving parents a choice of which school their children would attend and treating race as a tiebreaker in deciding which children would go to the most popular schools. In the perverse logic of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., this amounted to ''discriminating among individual students based on race.'' That's bad history, which, as Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote in an impassioned dissent, ''threaten[s] the promise of Brown.''"

Demonstrators chanted ''The land is not for sale,'' along with antigovernment slogans, in what activists said was the largest protest in months. The unity proposal has increased tensions in Bahrain, which is still in turmoil more than a year after the government violently suppressed a Shiite-led popular uprising, with military help from the Saudi government. The Saudis, fearing the contagion of the revolts in Bahrain and elsewhere, and seeking to counter the influence of Iran, their regional rival, have pushed a proposal for greater unity with five other Persian Gulf monarchies. While Bahrain's king has welcomed the proposal, opposition activists in the country, and some of the other gulf states, have balked at the idea. Leaders in the gulf this week decided to delay any decisions on the matter."

The men, who were among thousands of people from out of town who traveled to Chicago for a weekend of NATO-related protests, were charged with criminal acts relating to terrorism, conspiracy to commit terrorism, and possession of explosives. Bond for the three men -- Jared Chase, 27, of Keene, N.H.; Brent Betterly, 24, of Oakland Park, Fla.; and Brian Jacob Church, 22, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. -- was set at $1.5 million each.

But there are occasions, as there were in their 3-0 victory over the Devils on Saturday in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals, when the Rangers know the best move is to clear the way for goalie Henrik Lundqvist. ''You've got to make the read,'' said defenseman Ryan McDonagh, who led the Rangers on Saturday with 28 minutes of ice time and 4 blocked shots and who had a plus-2 differential. ''Is it better to block the shot or to get the opponent out of the way and let Hank do his thing? Our style is to always think shot-block first. But sometimes, the only play you have is to clear the crease -- and always, always, you have to tie up sticks.''"

2012-05-19T00:00:00Z,"The international community has not had much success trying to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. For years, it was split on how much pressure to apply, and Tehran deftly exploited that division. Since President Obama took office, the major powers have imposed increasingly strong sanctions aimed at Iran's banks and oil trade. It is crucial to maintain that cohesion as a second round of negotiations opens this week in Baghdad. The initial talks in Istanbul last month were encouraging enough for both sides to agree to meet again. This time, Iran will have to offer concrete proposals to address core concerns. It could move significantly toward a solution by suspending all its uranium enrichment activities, which the United Nations Security Council first demanded in 2006. At a minimum, it needs to stop enriching to 20 percent purity (well beyond the 5 percent needed for civilian nuclear programs and a few steps from bomb grade) and to close its Fordo nuclear facility. If Iran does that, the United States and its allies -- Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China -- are expected to offer to take the stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium out of the country, fabricate it into fuel rods for Tehran's medical research reactor and help with safety upgrades to Iran's civilian nuclear program."

But the attack goes well beyond abortion, into birth control, access to health care, equal pay and domestic violence. Republicans seem immune to criticism. In an angry speech last month, John Boehner, the House speaker, said claims that his party was damaging the welfare of women were ''entirely created'' by Democrats. Earlier, the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, sneered that any suggestion of a G.O.P. ''war on women'' was as big a fiction as a ''war on caterpillars.''"

2012-05-19T00:00:00Z,"CAMP DAVID, Md. -- Leaders of the world's richest countries banded together on Saturday to press Germany to back more pro-growth policies to halt the deepening debt crisis in Europe, as President Obama for the first time gained widespread support for his argument that Europe, and the United States by extension, cannot afford Chancellor Angela Merkel's one-size-fits-all approach emphasizing austerity. Pointedly recognizing ''that the right measures are not the same for each of us,'' the leaders of the Group of 8 nations, at a meeting hosted by Mr. Obama at Camp David, committed to ''take all necessary steps'' to strengthen their economies. They said they wanted to keep Greece in the euro zone and vowed to work to promote growth in Europe, though behind the scenes distinct differences remained over what kinds of stimulus policies to pursue."

2012-05-19T00:00:00Z,"WHEN I listen to President Obama speak to and about women, he sometimes sounds too paternalistic for my taste. In numerous appearances over the years -- most recently at the Barnard graduation -- he has made reference to how women are smarter than men. It's all so tired, the kind of fake praise showered upon those one views as easy to impress. As I listen, I am always bracing for the old go-to cliché: ''Behind every great man is a great woman.'' Some women are smarter than men and some aren't. But to suggest to women that they deserve dominance instead of equality is at best a cheap applause line."

Although the buyers, the investor Howard Marks and his wife, Nancy, paid slightly less than the $60 million asking price, the deal still topped the previous record for a co-op, $48million, for an apartment at 1060 Fifth Avenue in2008.The seller, Courtney Sale Ross, bought the apartment with her husband, the Time Warner executive Steven J. Ross, in the 1980s for around $8 million. Mr. Ross died in 1992.They combined two units to create a palatial home. There are 8 bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, 7 fireplaces and 6 terraces with commanding views in every direction. Michael Gross, who wrote a book about 740Park and its residents, first reported the sale in April, weeks before the transaction was listed in city records. The buyers were represented by Roberta Golubock of Sotheby's International Realty, and the seller was represented by Kathy Sloane of Brown Harris Stevens. Both declined to comment. The Marks family will join several other billionaires who call 740 Park home, including David Koch and Stephen Schwarzman. The price did not break the record for a condo apartment in the city --that was $88 million, at 15 Central Park West -- but gaining the approval of a notoriously strict co-op board is an accomplishment that no amount of great wealth can guarantee. Sheik Hamad bin Jassimbin Jabr al-Thani, the prime minister and foreign minister of Qatar and a member of its royal family, made headlines recently after reports that he had been rejected by the board at 907 Fifth Avenue, where he had agreed to buy two apartments from the estate of the heiress Huguette Clark. For years, 740 Park reigned as the city's most prestigious address. But in recent years it has been challenged, with15 Central Park West drawing the world's biggest spenders. And as the city's tallest residence-- the 90-story Extell project known asOne57 -- continues to rise on the southern edge of Central Park, with penthouses priced north of$110 million, storied addresses like 740 Park will face even more competition for hearts and dollars of the super-rich. But as this sale shows, the prewar co-op can still hold its own. Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday."

There has been a lot of scholarship devoted to the study of Facebook, sparking debate about the mental health and personality traits of frequent users.

She had been inspired by John James Audubon's ''The Birds of America'' and set out to make a companion version that would include life-size renderings of the eggs and nests of all the bird species found in Ohio. Her first lithographs won plaudits from Theodore Roosevelt, but after finishing only 5 of 130 illustrations, Jones, 32, died of typhoid fever. At great cost, her family managed to complete her project.

But while he didn't suffer the financial woes and chaos that often plague artistic careers, what he described as his ''wretched, uneasy and violent brain'' led him to write melancholy, tortured music. A sense of despair certainly pervades the Grave movement of Chausson's Concerto in D for Violin, Piano and String Quartet, which received a full-blooded, inspired performance from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in the last program of its season on Friday evening at Alice Tully Hall. Chausson, sometimes accused of having been an amateur composer, since he didn't earn (or need to earn) a living writing music, enjoyed a major success and fleeting happiness with the premiere of this work in 1892."

She first came to prominence in 2007 with her debut, ''Caramel,'' a sleepily beguiling film about the private lives and longings of four women working in a beauty shop in Beirut, which Labaki, in the starring role, lovingly portrayed as a warmly gossipy city full of battered, Old World charm. The film refused to so much as nod at the 15-year civil war that tore the city apart. ''You say Beirut and people think bombs and women crying in the street, but I wanted to show a sweet, everyday Lebanon, on a sunny day,'' she says. Yet with her new film, ''Where Do We Go Now?,'' which opens on May 11, Labaki directly addresses the country's deep religious divisions. Set in a mixed Christian-Muslim village, the movie (starring Labaki alongside a cast of mostly nonactors) tells the story of Christian and Muslim women who go to Lysistrata-like extremes to keep their menfolk from turning on each other as sectarian strife breaks out around them. ''The film is an homage to all the women in my country who wear black to this day to mourn husbands, sons and brothers,'' Labaki says. ''It's a way of saying, 'Can we talk about what happened in this country?' Can we turn to one another and say, 'I did something wrong, and I ask you to forgive me?' ''"

I travel to Paris and regions I have combed through many times mostly to see how they have got on in my absence and how far south the food has gone. Nostalgia aside, you get to a point where all you're interested in is the peculiar luxury of cultivating a receptively blank mind in a familiar, inexhaustible place.

2012-05-20T00:00:00Z,"CANNES, France -- By Sunday morning the 65th Cannes Film Festival had its first masterwork and an overwhelming critical favorite in Michael Haneke's ''Amour.'' A tender, wrenching, impeccably directed story of love and death, the French-language film stars Emmanuelle Riva and Jean-Louis Trintignant as a Parisian couple in their 80s -- named Georges and Anne, as are most of Mr. Haneke's middle-class couples -- struggling with an increasingly debilitating illness and the specter of what comes next. One day over breakfast she suffers a frightening episode that leaves her briefly locked in a mute, seemingly unaware blankness. She's there, but not, and then just as suddenly she returns. A hospital stay follows along with an operation, a grim prognosis, a slide into helplessness, the expected accumulation of humiliations, natural and not, and swells of emotion. Half-frozen by a stroke, Anne's body has begun to betray her, but Georges holds her so very close: he brushes her hair, bathes and dresses her. Somewhat stooped, with a shaky, hitchy walk, he trembles when he lifts her from the bed or a chair, but he keeps holding on. The first time he has to help her move from her wheelchair, she tells him how to grasp her properly, as if in a hug, a gesture that's poignant in its literalness -- they press into each other -- and reverberant of an erotic life shared and still remembered."

Several years ago, she and another strings-playing friend got deep into hot yoga and began toying with the idea of starting their own studio in New York City. Their branch of the hot-yoga chain Moksha opened in January, and it's been a success.

The experience of renovating the studio's West Village space brought Neufeld back around to music. ''I would come home covered in sawdust and stress and play violin,'' she says.

The elevated old road, built in 1953 as part of Highway 99, was damaged by an earthquake in 2001, and the thinking is that it will be particularly vulnerable when the next one strikes.

This has nothing to do with the '60s Paris designers André Courrèges and Pierre Cardin. The 2,000 guests at the preview last Tuesday suggested a new generation's humorous take on space-age style. Courrèges's white boots have been superseded by winged sneakers. On the street, the spring success has a futuristic look: an olive jacket with leather sleeves, $160 from Zara. At the armory, Marlon Gobel, a designer, incorporated gold Mylar shoulders into a beige jacket accessorized with tangerine-soled shoes and a matching tie. Caroline Zapf planted the flag to establish Azzedine Alaïa's designs as the Courrèges's of this era. The shape of the red Mars rocks mirrored the multifaceted look of this new venture into space.

In the north, Route 28 meanders near lakes like George past ski joints like Gore. Its Adirondack portion crosses the churning headwaters of the Hudson River. Farther south, it passes by splotches of fresh water, tiny towns with names that tell you who lived there before (Indian Lake) and why (Old Forge), and skirts classic-sounding outposts like Utica and Rome.

There was the apocryphal but appropriate story of Brezhnev's showing his humble mother around his historic office, his magnificent collection of foreign luxury cars and his palatial dacha with its superb meals, and asking for her impressions -- to which she replied: ''It's wonderful, Leonid, but what happens if the Bolsheviks come back?'' But if even a fraction of the stories about the wealth and lifestyles of China's ''princelings'' -- the descendants of Mao's revolutionary generation -- are to be believed, China's New Class wants not only control, but also ownership.

2012-05-20T00:00:00Z,"WITH the Atlantic hurricane season about to begin, the trusted weather forecasters at Colorado State University are predicting 10 storms severe enough to earn proper names and four wind-whipped into the demonic rampage we call hurricanes, with two of them major hell-raisers. That's a relatively mild season, but if it's your house that is demolished, it's an active season for you. This year's roster of storm names -- some of which may be preceded by the honorific ''Hurricane'' -- includes Debby, Rafael, Alberto, Valerie and Helene. I'll never get used to land-scrubbing, wave-rearing, home-wrecking, cyclonic mayhem referred to by human names. It's too reminiscent of pilots' painting their girlfriends' names on warplanes, a fad especially popular during World War II, when R.A.F. Hawker Hurricane fighters ruled the Battle of Britain skies."

They were members of the inner court of Bo Xilai, the Communist Party aristocrat who ran the city, and they had come to repair a rupture between the strong-willed Mr. Bo and his equally driven police chief. Just days earlier, on Jan. 28, the police chief, Wang Lijun, had pressed Mr. Bo over evidence tying Mr. Bo's wife to the death last fall of a British businessman, prompting Mr. Bo to punch Mr. Wang in the face, Mr. Wang later recounted to others. The three men -- two of them powerful businessmen and the other a former intelligence agent -- had befriended Mr. Bo and Mr. Wang years ago.

Ms. Lim, who performed the complete cycle in Paris over eight consecutive days in 2010, offered two sonatas -- No. 29 in B flat (Op. 106, ''Hammerklavier'') and No. 30 in E (Op. 109) -- in her American debut on Thursday evening, for a small audience at Le Poisson Rouge. An idiosyncratic player with plenty of original ideas and the technique to carry them out, Ms. Lim has devoted considerable time to studying not only the works themselves but also Beethoven biographies and letters and other historical materials. For her EMI recording (to be released exclusively on iTunes), she has written her own extensive notes, grouping the sonatas into eight unconventional headings like ''Aspects of an Inflexible Personality'' (Op. 2, Nos. 1, 2 and 3) and ''Extremes in Collision'' (Op. 10, Nos. 1, 2 and 3)."
2012-05-20T00:00:00Z,"TO hear the artist Geoffrey Hendricks tell it, having his portrait painted by Alice Neel was not an entirely pleasant experience. ''While she was painting, her focus was totally on the painting,'' said Mr. Hendricks, who sat with his partner, Brian Buczak, at Ms. Neel's kitchen table, in 1978. ''We had to sit without moving until she said we could take a break. It was not a conversational situation at all. That came before and after.'' The three ultimately became close friends. The portrait, on view through June 23 at David Zwirner gallery in Chelsea as part of ''Alice Neel: Late Portraits & Still Lifes,'' is at once intimate, casual and subtly erotic. (''She brought out the bowl of bananas and avocados with a little twinkle in her eye,'' Mr. Hendricks said.) It's also one of the rare works by Ms. Neel depicting a couple who was happy. ''She was a great story teller, just as in her portraits,'' said Mr. Hendricks (at right in the painting). ''She really gets in and extracts the essence of a person's personality.'' JOHNNY MISHEFF"

Each was about the length of an LP and based on a book of poetry. ''God's Trombones'' drew on the 1927 work of the same name by James Weldon Johnson, seven connected poems using the rhetoric of the black American church service; ''Inferno'' drew on Dante. As suites, and in some aspects of arrangement and harmony, they contained the spirit and substance of Duke Ellington. But in other ways they embodied what we can call the Jazz at Lincoln Center impulse: be ambitious, be noble, be narrative, be permanent."

Mr. Swanson designed the remarkable set, a construction of mirrors and thin wooden pillars that stands in for multiple places but most of all for a dance studio, a home for Mr. Ferver's imaginings. One way the two men are alike is that they both grew up gay in rural America. They are two of the ''boys and girls'' whom Mr. Ferver talks about, the ones who escape to New York or San Francisco.

He posed for Sukita for an hour, tousling his hair and plugging his ears with his fingers. They didn't talk much, because Sukita knew very little English and Bowie's Japanese was limited, but they still created an enduring image for his '' 'Heroes' '' album cover. The pictures, outtakes and all, are part of a new book, ''Speed of Life,'' a collaboration between the two of them that draws on Sukita's pictures of Bowie over a 40-year period. Nick Roylance, an owner of Genesis Publications, which is releasing the book in Britain in May and later this year in the United States, describes the photo shoot as practically an afterthought.

Tamke and I are at the annual Otha Turner Family Picnic, a legendary jam session that takes place every summer behind a tumbledown sharecropper's shack deep in Mississippi's hill country.

And then there are a couple dozen like me: urban cosmopolites eager to hear the deepest roots of the blues. Tamke calls himself ''a redneck,'' and he's attacked me because I'm from The New York Times. Shouting into my ear over the music, Tamke makes me his megaphone for what he wants the outside world to know: ''Our races have melded together, we share everything,'' he says, voice trembling. ''We love each other.'' He's squeezing my skull so hard it feels like it might pop, and it's clear that he's under the influence of something very powerful. The moonshine or the music, I don't know. Finally, when it seems something is about to crack -- my neck, or Tamke's tenuous hold on sanity, or both -- he lets me go. ''It's sacred,'' he says, choking up. ''It's ancient, man.'' ''It'' is fife and drum, an African take on colonial English marching songs, and one of the oldest forms of distinctly American music, played by the slaves of Jefferson's Monticello and still played today -- by one family, once a year, at this, one of the last of the traditional farm picnics celebrating the end of the growing season. I first met Tamke earlier in the day, before the sun had gone down, when the party was still getting going. He sat beside me on a hay bale, friendly-like, and struck up a conversation. He introduced me to his father, John, who sat nearby in a wheelchair, his left leg amputated above the knee due to the ravages of Agent Orange (and who has since died). After coming home from Vietnam, Tamke Sr. became a local judge. Back in those days, he told me, it was a point of family pride to ''take care of the minorities,'' and he reminisced about his grandfather bringing him outside, 50 or 60 years ago, to hear the drum call the field hands to the picnic."

2012-05-20T00:00:00Z,"LOS ANGELES -- The Wanda Group, a Chinese conglomerate with extensive interests in the entertainment business, has agreed to acquire AMC Entertainment, North America's second-largest movie theater owner, in a deal that is valued at $2.6 billion, including roughly $2 billion in assumed debt, the companies said Sunday. The acquisition creates the world's largest theater group, the companies said. It also represents a significant expansion of Chinese influence in the American film industry. The industry has been looking to China for a vast new reservoir of ticket buyers for Hollywood movies, while joining Chinese investors to produce films like the planned ''Iron Man 3'' and teaming up to build studio facilities and a new Disney theme park in China."

2012-05-20T00:00:00Z,"The Philadelphia Orchestra is going all out to acknowledge the contribution of Charles Dutoit as he concludes his fourth and final season as chief conductor. The orchestra owes him, big time. The musicians played splendidly for Mr. Dutoit on Friday night at Carnegie Hall, his last appearance in New York as their artistic leader. Mr. Dutoit stepped into a delicate situation four years ago in Philadelphia. For reasons that are hard to pin down, Christoph Eschenbach's tenure as music director, which began in 2003, did not work out. He and the orchestra parted ways after just five seasons. While the search began for another music director, Mr. Dutoit accepted the newly created position of chief conductor, also serving as artistic adviser."
2012-05-20T00:00:00Z,"CARACAS, Venezuela -- The expression of overwhelming emotion on the face of Sigifredo López, freed after almost seven years as a hostage and about to clutch his two sons in a fierce embrace, is one of the most enduring images of Colombia's nearly five-decade guerrilla war. That made the shock even greater for many Colombians last week when Mr. López was arrested on suspicion of helping to carry out the kidnapping in which he and 11 other provincial lawmakers were seized a decade ago. The transformation of Mr. López, 48, has transfixed Colombia in the days since his arrest, in part because his story, in all its vertiginous phases, is so emblematic of the senseless brutality of this country's long conflict. Mr. López has not yet been charged, and prosecutors said they were continuing their investigation. A lawyer for Mr. López said he was innocent."

2012-05-20T00:00:00Z,"Many of the food world's recent obsessions hail from Sicily. But don't stop at arancini, those sauce-filled fried rice balls that are in every Sicilian cafe. Here's how to sample regional specialties at the source. Almond cookies Dainty almond-paste cookies called pasta di mandorle are worth the windy, 45-minute ascent to the ancient Phoenician town of Erice. It was the nuns in nearby convents who perfected the recipe in the 15th century, which eventually made its way to the town pastry shops. Pasticceria Maria Grammatico makes the definitive version. Via Vittorio Emanuele, 14; 011-39-0923-869390; mariagrammatico.it."
2012-05-20T00:00:00Z,"All of history seems to have passed through Sicily at some point. So for a crash course, be strategic and seek out a few plum sites. La Cattedrale di Palermo (Corso Vittorio Emanuele; cattedrale.palermo.it), built in 1185, is a cut-and-paste job of architectural styles -- Byzantine, Norman, Spanish, Gothic -- that tells the story of conquest and influence on the island. The ancient Romans, Renaissance Florentines and English Romantic poets, to name a few, all fell in love with (and wrote obsessively about) the Teatro Greco in Taormina (above; Via Teatro Greco, 41; 011-39-0942-23220). Today the gnarled ruins of the theater are little more than the city's star tourist attraction, though it is worth the $10 entrance fee for perfectly framed views of the Ionian Sea and Mount Etna. The Valley of the Temples (parcodeitempli.net), with over 3,200 acres of Greek temples, theaters and tombs, is the best reason to pass through the dull region of Agrigento. Second best is the beach coastline known as Eraclea Minoa, one of Italy's most remote, 25 miles away. And La Cattedrale di Monreale (Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, Monreale; cattedraledimonreale.it), 25 minutes from Palermo, is a modest porticoed cathedral from a distance. But inside the 12th-century Norman church are beautiful cloistered gardens and gleaming gold mosaics of astonishing detail -- some of the best in Sicily. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
2012-05-20T00:00:00Z,"''I don't want to sound like a Luddite, but I'm very skeptical of big business,'' the artist Tom Sachs said, talking about NikeCraft, a small collection he did with the shoemaker that he introduced with his exhibition, ''Space Program: Mars,'' now at the Park Avenue Armory. Mr. Sachs is no Luddite, and he has raised enough questions about consumerism over the years to be wary of his own motives in collaborating with a major brand. I happened to drop by the Armory as Mr. Sachs was finishing the installation for Tuesday night's opening, and with a schoolboy's enthusiasm (and a nerdish pocket protector poking out of his shirt), he led me into a room that had the gear on display. I was bowled over."

2012-05-21T00:00:00Z,HOW TO TEACH RELATIVITY TO YOUR DOG By Chad Orzel
2012-05-21T00:00:00Z,"According to Romantic ballet, there are two worlds: the real and the supernatural. Most of the famous 19th-century ballets that we know are about that dualism: The mortal hero belongs to this life, the ethereal heroine belongs to the other one. Ballet itself, with the unnatural extremes of its academic technique (pointwork, 180-degree turnout), is better suited to depicting the otherworldly and the language of the soul. But the eight characters in George Balanchine's two-part ''Liebeslieder Walzer'' (''Love Song Waltzes,'' 1960) belong to both worlds. In the work's first half, the dancers, wearing formal attire, are their social selves: the women in ball gowns, the men in tailcoats and white tie, and all in heeled shoes. In the second half, they and their setting are transfigured: Though the men simply remove their gloves, the women are now in calf-length tulle and in point shoes, while the room has become translucent; they have become their own souls. Whereas 19th-century ballet implies that you must choose between the two worlds, Balanchine's Romanticism suggests that you exist in both."

2012-05-21T00:00:00Z,"The Environmental Protection Agency last year revoked a permit for a planned, 2,278-acre West Virginia coal mine that encapsulated everything wrong with a particularly destructive form of strip mining known as mountaintop removal. Two months ago, however, in a wrongheaded decision, a Federal District Court judge ruled that the agency had not only exceeded its authority but resorted to ''magical thinking'' to justify its action. The agency has announced that it would appeal the judge's decision. This is exactly the right move, on two counts. First, the Spruce No. 1 mine would have buried 6.6 miles of streams under tons of mining waste, inflicting permanent damage on the environment and local communities. Second, it is important for the E.P.A. to assert its authority under the Clean Water Act at a time when both the law and the agency are under fire in Congress."

Antonis Samaras, the leader of the conservative party, which signed the 130 billion-euro (or $170-billion) debt deal with the socialists in February, said New Democracy would run in the June 17 election on a joint platform with a liberal grouping, the Democratic Alliance, led by Dora Bakoyannis, a former foreign minister and old conservative rival.

The decision by the magazine, which is published by a Met fund-raising affiliate, the Metropolitan Opera Guild, and which freely reviews companies around the world, troubles some opera experts. It is also the latest sign of sensitivity from the Met under its general manager, Peter Gelb, in the face of criticism over its productions. The move came after a review in April took aim at the Met's new production of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle -- a hallmark of Mr. Gelb's tenure that has led to a firestorm -- and after a top Opera News editor criticized the Met's direction in a scathing essay in the May issue."

The nation's Catholic bishops, unable to reverse the ruling by prevailing on the White House or Congress, have now turned to the courts, as they warned they would. The bishops say the requirement is an unprecedented attack on religious liberty because it compels Catholic employers to provide access to services that are contrary to their religious beliefs. The mandate is part of the Obama administration's overhaul of the health care system, which the bishops say they otherwise support."

But in the wake of JPMorgan Chase's stunning trading loss, now reportedly at $3 billion and counting, committee members need to push the regulators testifying -- and each other -- to explain why, four years after the financial meltdown, speculative trading in these risky instruments has not been reined in. The Dodd-Frank law was supposed to bring much-needed oversight to the multitrillion-dollar market for derivatives, including transparent trading, mandatory reporting and higher capital and collateral requirements.

So routine is the practice, and so universally valued, that the American government has traditionally protected it with a law that shields a lent work from being seized by anyone with a claim to legal ownership while the art is on display here. In recent years, though, American museum directors have come to fear that this safeguard has eroded, and that foreign museums, dreading entanglement in costly ownership battles, are more hesitant to make loans. So they have asked Congress to increase the security for global art swaps."

2012-05-21T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON -- In a series characterized by striking ebbs and flows, one constant has remained: the team that wins the third quarter wins the game. That stood true in the first four games of the Eastern Conference semifinal series between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers, and it was driven home again, forcefully, Monday night. Trailing by 3 points after a spotty first half, the Celtics erupted in the third quarter, led by Brandon Bass, who scored 18 of his 27 points in the quarter, 2 more than the 76ers. The explosion, coupled with a stifling defense and a host of Philadelphia turnovers, turned the game around and enabled the Celtics to take a 101-85 victory and a 3-2 series lead."

She wore a short pink party dress with poofy sleeves and her hair in bangs and a flip, a retro 1960s do. She looked doll-like, a brunette version of Alice in Wonderland from a Disney film, but showing off more leg than Alice would. And when she began her first song, ''Cameo Lover,'' an upbeat plea to her man for intimacy, her voice was anything but innocent. Some of the people crowding around the stage that night in March began to sing along, even though the song is not on American pop radio, and her first album, ''Vows,'' comes out in the United States on Tuesday. ''I always imagined my first American tour might be pretty modest,'' she said later. ''What I was really surprised about was how many people knew the words to my songs already.'' Her cross-country tour continues through July 7."

We had all beat our hands raw with clapping through a succession of showstoppers, including a tap sequence that would have made you swear the ghosts of the Nicholas Brothers had possessed its performers; an athletic series of variations on the Charleston; and a knockout rendition of ''Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,'' that immortal anthem to non-liquid assets."

Choral conductors, in any case, can argue that in terms of this Mass, theories about Bach's choruses are academic, since Bach never performed the work. Harold Rosenbaum advanced no theories about optimum ensemble size when he directed his Canticum Novum Singers in the B minor Mass on Saturday evening at the Church of St. Jean Baptiste on the Upper East Side. He simply led his 53 singers, 4 soloists and the moderately scaled Artemis Chamber Ensemble in a generally brisk, shapely performance that focused on the work's devotional core and celebrated its extraordinary structure."

I sat in the row directly behind the family of Mr. Chen, the blind human rights activist who had been admitted to the United States to study law at New York University, and their American handlers. I wondered what I would say to Mr. Chen if I had the chance. (There was no such opportunity; I suspected that his handlers -- who unlike Mr. Chen's two well-behaved children bounced out of their seats with unusual frequency, alerting anyone nearby that something unusual was afoot -- would have intercepted any attempt at conversation.) I imagine other passengers wondered the same thing; as the Chen family exited the plane, the cabin of United Airlines Flight 88 filled with spontaneous applause."

Kidnappings and bank robberies are common around the city. And women report sexual assaults by taxi drivers, even in broad daylight. Across Egypt, carjackers have grown so bold that they steal their victims' cellphones and tell them to call to negotiate the return of the cars. And in Sharqiya, a rural province in the Nile Delta, villagers have taken the law into their own hands, mutilating and burning the bodies of accused thugs and hanging them from lampposts."
2012-05-22T00:00:00Z,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea warned on Tuesday that it would have to take ''countermeasures'' if the United States insisted on sanctions, while the latest satellite imagery of the country's nuclear test site suggested heightened preparations for a possible underground nuclear test. The warning came a day after Glyn T. Davies, the top United States envoy on North Korea, said that the North would face more sanctions should it conduct a nuclear test. The Group of 8 nations issued a similar warning last week amid concerns that the North's new leadership headed by Kim Jong-un might attempt a nuclear test to boost its standing at home and regain some of the leverage it lost when a rocket failed to put a satellite into orbit in April."

2012-05-22T00:00:00Z,"''Wherever we are, what we hear is mostly noise,'' the composer John Cage said in a 1937 lecture later published as ''The Future of Music: Credo.''

That quotation appeared atop a news release describing ''Music in Layers,'' a concert presented by the composers' collective Red Light New Music on Monday evening at the Leonard Nimoy Thalia at Symphony Space."
2012-05-22T00:00:00Z,"The conundrum that Samuel I. Schwartz, the traffic engineering expert, faced was this: How could the already jam-packed streets in the heart of Brooklyn accommodate thousands of extra cars filled with fans traveling to a basketball arena and desperately searching for parking? His answer, revealed on Tuesday to a panel of Brooklyn officials with all the flourish and detail of a general planning to storm the beaches of Normandy, was to discourage driving entirely, by cutting the number of parking spaces at the Barclays Center in half."
2012-05-22T00:00:00Z,"It took a month of protests to depose the president of Tunisia and 18 days to remove Hosni Mubarak from power in Egypt. Libya took longer. Rebels there spent more than eight bloody months fighting Muammar el-Qaddafi before defeating him. But Syria -- where protests began at roughly the same time as in Libya -- remains in a vicious civil war, and the fighting seems very far from over. One reason for this is simple: Syria's economy was designed to all but prevent a broad coalition from forming against Bashar al-Assad's regime. This is, of course, awful news for most Syrians. But it also calls into question some Things We Thought We Knew About Revolutions -- the most important being that countries with diverse economies and a growing middle class are supposed to be better at overthrowing despotic rulers than petrocracies like Libya or Iraq. Before I visited Syria in 2003 and 2004, I expected it to look like North Korea with souks. But I was surprised to find that Damascus and Aleppo -- the two major commercial centers -- contain truly affluent neighborhoods. Many locals drove sports cars, wore fancy watches, ate at top-notch restaurants and generally made me feel like a broke hick. And I met a lot of people in the big cities who made a decent living as engineers, doctors, shopkeepers, even artists. They may not have been rich, but they led far more comfortable lives than folks I encountered in neighboring countries like Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq."
2012-05-22T00:00:00Z,"Even when it is not executed perfectly, theater can stir a range of feelings, from boundless elation to existential despair. On rare occasions, it can even impart blinding pain, as an overly tight mask presses your glasses into your face, setting off sensitive nerve endings you did not know you possessed. I learned this on Thursday night as I wandered the corridors of ''Sleep No More,'' the site-specific theater event presented in a labyrinthine Chelsea warehouse. Created by the British company Punchdrunk, ''Sleep No More'' lets masked attendees follow, with eyes, ears, hands and feet, an open-ended tale that mashes up ''Macbeth'' with elements of Hitchcock films like ''Rebecca'' and ''Vertigo.''"

But since her ascendance, she has never really disappeared. Wearing different outfits, the British bird of the 1960s and the breakdancing b-girl of the 1980s are among countless offshoots. Let's not forget that defiant pop shape-shifter Madonna, a flapper to her bones, no matter what she wears. And now there's Carole J. Bufford, a sizzling cabaret performer who in her show ''Speak Easy'' at the Metropolitan Room offers the fullest realization I can remember of a 1920s girl gone wild. Ms. Bufford has a bright, rangy voice and big blue eyes that emit snapping electrical charges. She can be dangerous, but she is also funny."

Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase would have us believe that regulators' attempts to clip the wings of financial companies are about as misguided as trying to curb spam by shutting down the Internet. To most Americans, a financial crisis that lopped $19.2 trillion off household wealth and produced the deepest recession since the 1930s may be reason enough to limit what financial institutions can do. Andrew G. Haldane, executive director for financial stability at the Bank of England, estimates that the crisis wiped out one to 3.5 years' worth of the world's economic output, in present value."

Mr. Ravi's spying on Mr. Clementi in a sexual encounter with another man was abhorrent. His actions showed ''colossal insensitivity,'' Judge Glenn Berman said.

Militants allied with Al Qaeda quickly claimed responsibility for the bombing, in which a man disguised as a soldier blew himself up in the midst of a military parade rehearsal near the presidential palace in Sana, the capital.

When the production did appear, in 1999, with performers gathered from around China, only the star, Qian Yi, and the flutist and orchestra leader, Zhou Ming, remained from the original troupe. The Shanghai company has since made lower-profile appearances in New York, and on Friday it returned with a full-evening production of ''The Lanke Mountain,'' an opera based on an ancient folk tale that has been staged at least since the 13th century, at Asia Society. The story, set in the Han dynasty (third century B.C.), could not be simpler, and its moral gave rise to the Chinese proverb ''Poured water cannot be retrieved.''"

The team, however, is now at the center of a scandal in which campus authorities and local law enforcement have been accused of doing too little to respond to claims of sexual assault. The football coach and the athletic director have been let go, a player has been arrested and the civil rights division of the United States Department of Justice recently said it would conduct a civil investigation to determine if county prosecutors and the Missoula police adequately handled numerous complaints of sexual assaults over the past three years, including 11 said to have happened on campus."

American news media reported last week that Anton Fomin, a nine-year old Russian child adopted into a Nebraska family, died in a house fire while his parents were gone. On Monday, Russia's children's rights ombudsman, Pavel Astakhov, demanded an investigation, saying that American investigators had established that the child had been locked in the basement. ''Either the boy was punished or he was neglected and got into the basement accidentally,'' Mr. Astakhov said, according to RIA Novosti news service. ''Why the boy was locked in the basement and why he could not get out, we will ask the U.S. attorneys about this.'' The United States Embassy in Moscow expressed its condolences to the child's family on Tuesday, and corrected what it called ''unsubstantiated reports'' that he was brought to the United States through an adoption program. ''Anton immigrated to the United States with his biological parents, not through intercountry adoption,'' the statement said. Russian authorities have repeatedly criticized lax checks on adoptive American parents after a spate of high profile deaths involving negligent and abusive families. Last December, Mr. Astakhov threatened to demand a moratorium on adoptions by Americans after a Pennsylvania court released a pair of adoptive parents with time served after they were convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death of a child."

Success, in terms of heavy traffic, led to the expansion of the food hall, which has nearly doubled in size over the last year.

Indeed, those who have mastered the art of lengthy meditation may be best equipped to concentrate on his glacially slow, highly repetitive sounds. For those who haven't, it can be a struggle to ward off tedium in pieces like Feldman's vast Piano and String Quartet (1985).

He chases after rolling pucks as if they just fell out of his wallet, and he raps at rebounds so hard that he looks as if he is trying to drive the puck clean through a goaltender's pads. He was on the ice for three goals Monday in a 4-1 win over the Rangers in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals. Even though he scored twice, he was most jubilant after feeding Travis Zajac for a goal off a Rangers' breakdown and a two-on-one rush, hunting Zajac down to hug him."

Those cloves, which liquefy in the mouth like pats of butter, may fend off colds, bellyaches and wrinkles. Still, the dish ($11) is a bold, possibly deranged choice for a first-date dinner (unless you met on Chowhound)."

On one side of the church wall, a few congregants beseech God as they join in the celebration of Mass. And on the other side, a few men beseech God as they join in games of basketball, their shouts of ''Jesus Christ!'' and ''Goddammit!'' rising above the wheezing of the close but unseen church organ. I am among these middle-aged blasphemers, showing no emotion if I win, but full-throated in my profane analysis if I lose. Bowed and gasping after each game, I feel the mysterious tug on my basketball jersey that tells me I belong in one of the hardwood pews a few dozen yards away, squirming once again inside the Catholic Church of today. But for now at least, I find more comfort standing here, on a hardwood basketball court in an old gym, breathing in the stale, familiar air of the Catholic Youth Organization past."

Prohibition finished off most of them. But some brands, like Schaefer, Ruppert and Rheingold, linger in memory. And on Friday, the museum will open an exhibition on beer in New York that includes hundreds of artifacts like old mugs, posters and trays.

Even as the economic crisis has spread through Europe, Spaniards had shielded social spending in those areas from the consequences.

No other restaurant in the city makes the simple cooking of fish (and the fish at Le Bernardin is cooked simply, when it is cooked at all) seem so ripe with opportunities for excitement. Some of the thrills are the hushed kind, like the way black garlic, pomegranate and lime support the crisp skin and white flesh of sautéed black bass. Others are scene-stealers, as when a white slab of steamed halibut is slowly surrounded by a crimson pool of beet sauce that, with crème fraîche stirred in, will turn the delirious pink of summer borscht."

The deal is so new that there are no architectural plans, binding documents or regulatory approvals. The price tag is unknown, but it appears that the city will offer the team nothing more than a 66-year lease on the land and rent credits to recoup the costs of shoring up the crumbling pier and making infrastructure improvements -- the sort of obligations that are usually picked up by the public."

He is 67 now, and his face shows years under the African sun, as a boy who dug with his parents for the fossilized remnants of human ancestors, as a conservationist and as a political reformer and raconteur. He has fractured his skull falling from a horse, had a wooden expedition boat destroyed by crocodiles, been whipped by political opponents in Kenya, and lost his kidneys to disease and patches of skin to cancer.

The more of it you amass, the more people expect you to use it to do big things, and, when you don't, the more ineffectual you look. That's the dilemma in which Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu of Israel finds himself. He avoided early elections by adding a new centrist coalition partner to his right-wing cabinet, giving him control of 96 of the 120 seats in Parliament. There are Arab dictators who didn't have majorities that big after rigged elections. What is unclear is whether Bibi assembled these multitudes to be better able to do nothing or be better able to do something important to secure Israel's future. The stakes could not be higher -- for him and Israel. Ami Ayalon, the former commander of Israel's Navy and later its domestic intelligence service, put it to me this way: ''I imagine a book called 'Jewish Leaders in Recent History' that one day Bibi's grandson will be reading. What will it say? In one version, I imagine the section about the State of Israel will say that Herzl envisaged it, Ben-Gurion built it and Netanyahu secured it as a Jewish democracy.'' But there is another version that could also be written, added Ayalon. ''This version will describe Herzl and Ben-Gurion in the same way, but it will say of Netanyahu that he was the only Israeli leader who had the political power and he missed his moment in history'' -- and, thereby, created a situation in which Israel is not a Jewish democracy anymore. ''Now is his moment to decide.''"

2012-05-22T00:00:00Z,"The choreographer Helen Simoneau hails from Quebec, but judging by the animated crowd at the Joyce SoHo on Friday night, she's no stranger in the United States. In 2010 she won first prize at ''The A.W.A.R.D. Show!'' in New York -- a dance competition hosted by the Joyce Theater Foundation -- and her company, Helen Simoneau Danse, is based both in New York and Winston-Salem, N.C. At first the setting seemed more suited to a cocktail party than a dance performance. One woman asked, ''How do you know Helen?'' But even after absorbing four of her works, the answer would have to be: not very well. This suite of dances, each with the word ''flight'' in its title, had the look and feel of one dance told four times. Flight distance, which Ms. Simoneau described in a program note as the distance an individual places between himself and others, was the evening's theme, but as a choreographic conceit it's dangerous territory. How do you make a dance about personal space that isn't obvious?"

2012-05-22T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON -- The revelation that China is the sole country that can bid on and buy debt directly from the United States Treasury, rather than through a financial intermediary, has raised concerns that the Obama administration is giving a secret, sweetheart deal to its biggest creditor. But experts said that the arrangement was probably beneficial to both parties, and was a product of changing trends in the market for Treasury debt as much as the deep economic ties between the two countries."
2012-05-22T00:00:00Z,"First he set the tee for a high pitch, and swung at the ball left-handed for a while. Then he lowered the tee and swung some more. Switching to the other batter's box, Mark Teixeira raised the tee and took right-handed cuts. The thwack of the bat, coming from the Yankees' indoor cage before practice on Tuesday, was a much better sound than a cough. The severe bronchial congestion that has ravaged Teixeira all season makes an easy excuse for his .229 batting average and startling lack of power. Kevin Long, the hitting coach, said he did not know what impact it has had."
2012-05-22T00:00:00Z,"MIAMI -- The Miami Heat paired LeBron James with Dwyane Wade two summers ago with designs to dominate the N.B.A. The plan has not unfolded the way it was envisioned, but the Heat are back on track less than a week after their season seemed to be in jeopardy."
2012-05-22T00:00:00Z,"ATHENS -- The Greek government will pump 18 billion euros (about $23 billion) into the country's four largest commercial banks this week to help them guard against losses from a worsening economy, bankers in Athens said on Tuesday, a step that will improve the banks' ability to raise money but will still leave them unable to lend money normally. The injection, which has been planned for some time, comes as Greek businesses and consumers continue to withdraw substantial amounts of money from their bank accounts amid uncertainty about the country's political and economic future."
2012-05-22T00:00:00Z,"When Carson McCullers explores her own mind these days on a stage at the Public Theater, the sound of a banjo goes with her. Now a banjo might seem too obvious a choice for the musical underlining of the thoughts of a Southern writer adrift in the North. But then you haven't heard the banjo music composed by Gabriel Kahane for ''February House,'' the very literary new musical that opened on Tuesday night at the Public Theater. It's a far twang from ''My Old Kentucky Home'' or ''Foggy Mountain Breakdown.'' Fragmented and dissonant, full of fragile melody and tensile strength, this music, played by Andy Stack, evokes the cracked-glass lyricism of McCullers's prose. And when Kristen Sieh, the haunting actress portraying McCullers, lifts her reedlike voice in wondering song, you may feel for this long-dead writer what Carson says she feels when she visits the freaks at Coney Island: an ineffable sense of communion."

Ms. Patinkin, who was working for a nonprofit, and Ms. Kulaga, a psychiatry researcher, met through the club and discovered they shared entrepreneurial ambitions. So they started Ovenly, a wholesale bakery in Greenpoint, Brooklyn; building on its success over the last two years, they have added a retail store. It opens Friday, and though they turn out red velvet cakes, chocolate chip cookies (bottom photo) and carrot spice cupcakes, most of their specialties offer uncommon flavors. Black olive shortbread, blue cheese-pecan scones, coconut date pistachio coffee cake (top), and a jelly doughnut muffin are all buttery and intriguingly savory-sweet, thanks to a good pinch of salt. Even the chocolate pudding frosting on the blackout cake is salted. The shop has a few seats for those wishing to indulge on the spot, with Stumptown coffee. Ovenly, 31 Greenpoint Avenue (West Street), Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (347) 689-3608, www.oven.ly. Cakes are $6 a slice ($65 whole); cookies, $2.25; muffins, $3; scones, $3.50; shortbread, $2.50; quiche, $5 a slice; and savory hot tarts (turnovers), $4.50."

New York should learn from Philadelphia, where the stop-and-frisk policy was the subject of a 2010 class-action suit for racial discrimination and violations of Fourth Amendment guarantees of freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. Like New York police officers, Philadelphia's were accused of using race as the basis for stops.

Ballet, in other words, is as much about the wandering male eye as it is about the female form. ''La Bayadère,'' first staged for Ballet Theater in 1980 by Natalia Makarova, returned to the company on Tuesday with an opening-night cast of Marcelo Gomes as Solor and Veronika Part as Nikiya, the beautiful temple dancer, to whom he has pledged his love.

The show gives us four work mates -- Milo (Danny Masterson), Gibbs (James Lesure), Tyler (Michael Cassidy) and Neal (Adam Busch) -- who are inexplicably kept on the payroll by a magazine called Full Steam even though they rarely seem to do any work.

The secretary of the interior, Ken Salazar, said the plan would allow the river's managers to release excess water -- more than twice as much as average flows -- through and over the hydroelectric dam at will to help propel silt and sediment downstream into the canyon. By mimicking the river's original dynamics, Interior Department officials said, the flows could help restore the backwater ecosystems in which native fish are most at home."

She regularly sees a host of pediatric specialists, including an ophthalmologist, an endocrinologist and a neurologist at UCLA Health System.

While UCLA Health System has long prided itself on being at the forefront of treating patients like Giselle, it is now trying to lower sharply the cost of providing that care. By enrolling young patients with complex and expensive diseases in a program called a medical home, the system tries to ensure that doctors spend more time with patients and work more closely with parents to coordinate care.

Although jurors have been weighing the complex and tawdry story of a concealed mistress, Rielle Hunter, and the child she and Mr. Edwards conceived -- and a cover-up financed with money from wealthy friends -- the question of guilt or innocence hinges on a single question: Did the money amount to gifts -- as Mr. Edwards contends -- or illegal and improperly reported campaign contributions, as the government contends?"

2012-05-23T00:00:00Z,"In 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama co-sponsored a tough law aimed at protecting the public from an accident or terrorist attack at one of the nation's chemical plants. Opposed by industry and President George W. Bush's White House, the bill never made it to the Senate floor. A weak substitute was passed instead, and the dangers remain. President Obama can fix the problem. In a letter to the president last week, a coalition of more than 100 environmental, public health and labor organizations argued that while Congressional gridlock made passage of new legislation even less likely now, the Environmental Protection Agency, under the Clean Air Act, could impose new safety rules on its own. Last month, Christine Todd Whitman, an administrator of the E.P.A. for Mr. Bush, made the same argument to Lisa Jackson, the E.P.A.'s present administrator."

''Obama has to go, baby,'' she tells her partner. The show appears on Spaces, one of the new channels YouTube has introduced as part of its push into original content. With a roster of programs -- other shows include ''Offbeat Spaces'' and the self-explanatory ''I Live With My Mom'' -- shown in three-to-five-minute episodes, most of which focus on young urbanites, Spaces aims to be a hipper HGTV.

At a summit meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, regional leaders failed to signal any significant new steps to stimulate the sputtering regional economy or resolve the competing agendas of President François Hollande of France, who favors stronger action to spur growth, and his German counterpart, Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has opposed aggressive moves to ease the pressure on Europe's weakest economies."

First, the relentlessly fashionable online retailer Mr Porter is staging a huge suit initiative starting June 6 to coincide with the new season of ''Suits,'' the television show about two scheming lawyers whose closets are stocked with the aforementioned garments as well as a skeleton or two. There will be a pop-up shop, a fashion show on the High Line, a choreographed appearance of men in suits on bicycles tearing all over town, an iPhone app to play Dapper Dan on, and God only knows what else -- but it will involve suits."
2012-05-23T00:00:00Z,"Every dog has its day, but time has run out on ''Dog the Bounty Hunter,'' A&E's long-running reality series about Duane Chapman, better known by the nom de bondsman Dog. Variety reported that A&E had declined to order additional installments of the series, which ran for eight seasons, and that its final episodes would start being shown next month. In 2004, after Mr. Chapman appeared in a segment on ''Take This Job,'' his series ''Dog the Bounty Hunter'' began, chronicling his family trade -- bringing in criminals and bail jumpers -- in Hawaii and Colorado. The series made him an unlikely face for A&E, a cable channel better known for staid programming like ''Biography.'' Mr. Chapman was also featured in some surprising off-camera adventures and was at times a figure of controversy. In 2006 federal marshals arrested him at his home in Hawaii on charges stemming from his 2003 capture of Andrew Luster, the Max Factor heir, in Mexico, where bounty hunting is illegal. (United States officials later dismissed an attempt to extradite Mr. Chapman.) His reality series was pulled by A&E for several months after an audio tape surfaced in which Mr. Chapman was heard using racial epithets, for which he apologized."

Others after finding out that their potential mate hasn't had a steady job in two years. For Jane Lynch, a repeated theme when she was single was overly fragrant women. ''I'd say, 'You smell good, but I'm allergic,' '' she said. ''I don't like perfume. I like scent.'' So what on earth was Ms. Lynch, the ''Glee'' actress, doing on Monday at Alice Tully Hall in Lincoln Center at the 40th annual FiFi Fragrance Awards, often referred to -- especially by its organizers -- as the Oscars of their industry?"

As the conference braced to grow to 18 teams in basketball and 13 in football and stretch from Boise to Providence to Tampa, its many athletic directors, coaches and officials met here this week. Call them college athletics' ''Imperfect Strangers.'' Joe Bailey, the conference's interim commissioner, summed up the uncertainty -- ''change is sort of the new normal'' -- as jokes about the necessity for name tags filled the conference rooms.

Born in Britain in 1941, he was raised in South Africa and served in its air force. And in 1966, he became a paid South African intelligence asset, using his air cargo company to spy on the military operations of nearby countries that opposed the apartheid regime. But in more recent years, Mr. Smulian's business failed, and he became essentially a nomad, moving from one African country to another, living on the edge of society. And then he became ensnared in a purported arms deal with terrorists that turned out to be a sting operation by the American government; he was used unwittingly to capture someone he knew, the Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout."

2012-05-23T00:00:00Z,"Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet is known for bringing New York the news from Europe, importing choreographers whose work is well known over there but rarely seen here. Usually that work is dark and angst-laden, conforming to what Americans think of as Continental. But on Tuesday, during the second program of the company's run at the Joyce Theater, the message from across the Atlantic seemed to be: hey, we can be fun, too. ''Simply Marvel,'' by the Dutch-born Regina van Berkel, was not so cheery at first. To somber piano music by Theo Verbey, under pendant tuliplike set pieces by Dietmar Janeck, three women (on point) and six men alternated between classical steps, performed as if under water, and an array of nonclassical spasms, performed as if under shock therapy. Partly coupled at first, the genders separated, the men wrapped in their own athletics and a little wary, it seemed, of the women."

Once you live on your own, your sheets can stay rumpled for days (and do, for many of us). Still, there's an art to making a bed, or at least that was the message at Lorin Marsh last week, where three interior designers gathered in the furniture company's East Side showroom to demonstrate to a small crowd the finer points of ''styling'' your bed. Sherry Mandell, a founder of Lorin Marsh who introduced the designers, set the tone by calling the bed the ''unsung hero'' of the home and ''the place you go to renew yourself and relax.'' In that spirit, the mattresses used to demonstrate bed making were not from Sleepy's but Hästens, the luxury brand that, according to the company's Web site, stuffs its bedding with natural materials like horsehair and wool ''from the forests of Sweden,'' something that its customers are presumably happy to pay as much as $36,000 for."

2012-05-23T00:00:00Z,"A persistent problem in American courts is the lack of translators to ensure that litigants who don't speak or read English can take part in their cases. That's the purpose of the Court Interpreters Act of 1978, which allows federal courts to order losing parties to pay prevailing parties the cost of interpreters. In a disappointing 6-to-3 ruling, the Supreme Court defined ''interpreter'' narrowly to mean ''one who translates orally from one language to another.'' To support this view, Justice Samuel Alito Jr.'s majority opinion cited reasoning from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit: ''Robert Fagles made famous translations into English of the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Aeneid, but no one would refer to him as an English-language 'interpreter' of these works.''"

Hours after performing at the Florida Classic, a football game in Orlando on Nov. 19, Mr. Champion, a drum major, entered the dark bus and was pummeled with hands, drumsticks, bass drum mallets, straps and even an orange cone. At least 15 band members struck and kicked Mr. Champion as he tried to reach the back of the bus.

2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"It began -- the uncertainty that darkened into anguish, the lurking sense of loss, the sudden expansion of people's vocabularies to encompass phrases like ''stranger danger'' -- on the day when a little boy talked his parents into saying yes to the kind of question every child asks, and when the answer is ''no, not yet,'' asks again and again: Can I walk to the bus stop by myself? Please? He had only a block and a half to go, past cast-iron storefronts and a long brick building that looked as if it might have been a stable when his grandfather was his age, which was 6. He knew that block and a half of SoHo, far grittier then than the tourist-filled street filled with upscale boutiques it would become. Every day for months, he had padded down the sidewalk and crossed the one street between his family's loft and the corner after that, where the bus stopped."

With Greece in meltdown, raising fears of cascading bank insolvencies and deepening recession, Europe's leaders failed again this week to agree on the ambitious initiatives needed to quell the crisis. For a few days before their Wednesday dinner meeting, it sounded as if Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany might be ready to change her all-austerity-all-the-time tune. France's new president, François Hollande, had campaigned and won on a pro-growth agenda, and Ms. Merkel was suddenly suggesting that some stimulus for Greece and others to spur growth might be possible."

She wired fresh roses she had bought that morning and had her hairstylist weave them into the tight braid wrapped around her head. That woman loves fashion! Linda Evangelista's look (center) was the work of the hairstylist Julien d'Ys, who fashioned black silk ribbon into a headpiece for her slick coif. And at the New York City Ballet spring gala, Tabitha Simmons (near right) accessorized an embroidered Dolce & Gabbana coat with a jeweled satin headpiece.

This is the premise of ''The Hunger Games,'' of course, and also of ''Battle Royale,'' a Japanese movie from 2000 that is now receiving a belated, limited release. Similarities between the two films have been noted by a handful of online pop culture mavens, and the question of influence is interesting."

Mr. Fitzgerald was criticized for making the comment after the 2008 arrest of Mr. Blagojevich, who was eventually convicted of trying to sell Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat. ''I probably could have had a colder shower, a little more sleep and some decaf,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said Thursday at a news conference. ''Having said that, I did get grief over it, and what bothers me about that, frankly, is I don't want it to overshadow what the agents did in that case.'' Mr. Fitzgerald, whose other high-profile prosecutions include public corruption charges against former Gov. George Ryan and a C.I.A. leak case against I.

The LS-100 looks like a piece of military machinery, but is really an eight-track recorder that you can slip into your pocket. The device -- which is about three inches long -- has two microphones at the top and a pair of XLR jacks on the bottom for recording directly from professional-grade sound gear. The recorder supports standard stereo recording or more complex eight-track recording complete with noise reduction, overdubbing and a direct-to-CD output option.

And while most Americans have caught a break over the last year, with the average price for a gallon of regular falling 15 cents compared with this time in 2011, in Western Washington it was up 32 cents as of Thursday, according to the Oil Price Information Service, a petroleum-pricing research group."

''What to Expect When You're Expecting''? Fair enough. But still. ''The Avengers''? Let's not go there. And stop interrupting me when I'm trying to make a serious point. Apart from the urgent necessity of reminding us that Will Smith is a movie star (and the usual need to wring a few more dollars out of a profitable franchise), ''Men in Black 3'' arrives in the multiplexes of the world with no particular agenda. Which may be part of the reason it turns out to be so much fun. You don't need to study up on the previous installments or master a body of bogus fanboy lore to enjoy this movie for the breezy pop throwaway it is.

But now Mr. M (James A. Williams), as his students call him, has let hope out of its cage. In speaking of its unexpected release, he blots his brow with a handkerchief.

Two other men were indicted on rape charges.

But he has not abandoned the big canvas of Romanticism, for which he has always been most admired, and on Wednesday evening he provided a gigantic sampling of it at a New York Philharmonic pension fund benefit concert. With Alan Gilbert on the podium, Mr. Kissin was the soloist in two big-boned works, Scriabin's early Piano Concerto in F sharp minor, and Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor. The Scriabin is a bona fide rarity and not entirely without justification. Scriabin composed the work in 1896 and was the soloist in the premiere the following year. Its main business is putting his own dazzling pianism on display, and though the distinctive voice and quirky harmonic style that would ring out in his later music are beginning to coalesce here, Scriabin still has a foot in Chopin's world."

Here, in the last gallery of the fresh and, yes, slightly intoxicating new exhibition at the New-York Historical Society, ''Beer Here: Brewing New York's History,'' I was reminded just what all the fuss was about during the course of recorded history, or at least, in this case, the recorded history of New York State. The show ends in a small Beer Hall, in which local varieties of this bitter, rich, smooth, quenching, biting beverage can be purchased and quaffed, as if in a celebratory ritual of a journey happily completed. Beer, we learn, under the firm guidance of the show's curators, Debra Schmidt Bach and Nina Nazionale, is one of those small things through which large forces can be discerned. And its history in New York is as unexpected as the variations in taste produced during today's micro-brewing renaissance."

The Miami Heat are moving on to the Eastern Conference finals because Wade did many things spectacularly besides scoring 41 points in a 105-93 victory: like flying to save a ball from going out of bounds that led to two big fourth-quarter free throws by LeBron James."

Stories of addiction frequently pass through a metaphorical crossroads -- redemption down one path, catastrophe down the other -- but Anders (Anders Danielsen Lie), Mr. Trier's protagonist, faces such a choice at every waking moment. You are never sure what he will do next, and it is clear that he is not, either. Nor does he necessarily know why he makes the choices he does, or what they mean. We meet Anders in the morning, as he awakens after a night in a nondescript motel with a woman we barely see. He makes his way back to the rehab center where he lives, stopping along the way for a suicide attempt that may, for all we know, be a daily ritual of halfhearted self-destruction.

David Wright can be the exception, the rare career Met, and the team should make it happen. There are no more excuses. Wright has been extraordinarily productive on the field, and the Mets have largely stabilized their finances."

Mr. Kiarostami is back this year with another film shot outside Iran: the Japanese-language ''Like Someone in Love,'' about the enigmatic, subtly shape-shifting relationship between a young woman and an old man in Tokyo. This time the reception has been quite different. Amid familiar Kiarostami themes like mistaken identity and role-playing, the film sustains an aura of opacity and mystery that left some bewildered and others enthralled at the press preview on Sunday -- up until an abrupt ending that prompted some loud boos. The reception was much warmer at the official screening on Monday, and the movie is still being talked about as a contender for the top prize, given Mr. Kiarostami's track record (a festival regular, he won the Palme d'Or in 1997 for ''Taste of Cherry'') and the avowed admiration of this year's jury president, the Italian filmmaker Nanni Moretti (who made a short about opening Mr. Kiarostami's classic ''Close-Up'' at his Rome cinematheque)."

The marquee combatants arrived in the late afternoon, welcomed by musical odes and a chorus of erratic drumming. Each defied his massive frame, nimbly performing the ''dance of champions'' and taking measures to repel black magic before stepping into the ring.

Perhaps Peter Dinklage, the Golden Globe and Emmy Award-winning actor who plays the cynical aristocrat Tyrion Lannister on that HBO fantasy series, can answer the question: This summer he will be starring in a new production of Molière's satire ''The Imaginary Invalid,'' as one of its lead female characters. Starring opposite Ethan Phillips (of ''Star Trek: Voyager''), who will portray the titular hypochondriac, Argan, Mr. Dinklage has been cast as his maid, Toinette, in this all-male staging of the play, which will be presented at the 2012 Bard SummerScape and directed by Erica Schmidt, Mr. Dinklage's wife, the festival's organizers said on Wednesday.

2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"CANNES, France -- The critics are angry. Wrung out perhaps by the arduous work of watching movies all day and night at the 65th Cannes Film Festival, they have begun to boo and jeer louder and more insistently, or so it seems. Are the selections really all that disastrous, deserving of the contemptuous dismissals or post- (and mid!) screening Twitter alerts? Certainly the antipathy aimed at the more formally experimental entries seems reflective of the same ungenerous, unadventurous mind-set (except when I boo, of course) that asserts itself here every year. The verdict on the French filmmaker Leos Carax's competition entry, ''Holy Motors,'' sounded evenly divided, with the clappers trying hard but failing to drown out the vigorous disdainers. Mr. Carax's reputation has run hot and cold at home, which may partly account for the battering given his diverting new film, which involves a long, episodic journey into the night by a mysterious man who may be an angel of death or an emissary from beyond, though which beyond -- heaven or the more far-out reaches of Mr. Carax's prodigious imagination -- is the question. Embodying this question with great ductile physicality is Mr. Carax's frequent collaborator, Denis Lavant, whose character, sometimes called Monsieur Oscar, is ferried around in a stretch white limo by his chauffeur, Céline (Édith Scob)."

''The only people that interest me,'' Sal says in voice-over, with Mr. Riley scatting out the famous words, ''are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones that never yawn or say a commonplace thing ... but burn, burn, burn like Roman candles across the night.'' Yet these boys scarcely simmer. ''On the Road,'' one of the most anticipated competition selections at the 65th Cannes Film Festival, had its press premiere on Wednesday morning and was received with well-behaved applause, a low-pulse response for a low-pulse endeavor. Written by Jose Rivera, the script has been extracted from both the 1957 novel and the 1951 scroll version, so named because Kerouac pounded it out on 120 taped-together sheets of tracing paper. That version, published in 2007 as ''On the Road: The Original,'' uses real names like Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady, which were changed for the novel to avoid libel charges. Some of the voice-over is taken right from the scroll: in the novel, for instance, Kerouac added ''mad to be saved'' to the qualities he ticked off in that brightly burning sentence."

On the plus side, the play stars my favorite soap-opera actress, Rosemary Prinz. (As Penny on ''As the World Turns,'' she did the ''my amnesia is cured'' scene of the 1960s.)"

President Obama's campaign, meanwhile, views Mr. Romney's Bain Capital years as a political liability that underscores his image as an out-of-touch multimillionaire, concerned only with turning profits for his wealthy investors. For Mr. Romney's campaign, the scrutiny of his time at Bain poses a delicate challenge: not only must he defend himself against attacks coming from the president, but he also must try to cast Bain and the lessons he learned there as a testament to his management skills."

As the polls closed after the second day of voting and officials began stacking the paper ballots in each of thousands of voting stations, at least three other contenders were still in the running. One was Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a more liberal, dissident former Brotherhood leader challenging the group's authority as the voice of political Islam. Also in the running were two former government officials under Mr. Mubarak -- Amr Moussa, a former foreign minister, and Ahmed Shafik, a former air force general and Mr. Mubarak's last prime minister -- both of whom were running as bulwarks against an Islamist takeover."

But the judges turned down the request from the defense for six extra months of preparation time. The long-awaited trial is one of the most important to deal with the Bosnian war, from 1992 to 1995, in which Mr. Mladic was the overall commander on the Serbian side.

During that time, more than four million patient theatergoers have waited in line to see a potent mix of raw talent, seasoned stage veterans and Hollywood imports do battle against the Central Park fauna, the occasional helicopter and the more than occasional thunderstorm to perform the classics free.

Is it wrong to think that a rehearsal dinner is for only the wedding party and close family or for all out-of-town guests, wedding party and family? It leaves a few of us awkwardly drifting while the rest of our friends are at the rehearsal dinner. On an emotional level, it makes those of us who were left out feel, well, left out."

''Simply Marvel,'' by the Dutch-born Regina van Berkel, was not so cheery at first. To somber piano music by Theo Verbey, under pendant tuliplike set pieces by Dietmar Janeck, three women (on point) and six men alternated between classical steps, performed as if under water, and an array of nonclassical spasms, performed as if under shock therapy. Partly coupled at first, the genders separated, the men wrapped in their own athletics and a little wary, it seemed, of the women."

''One of them was a very vivid trip around the North Woods and seeing forests bleeding and sludge from a creek emptying into the Bad River,'' Wiggins said. ''I ended up at a dilapidated northern log home with rotten snowshoes falling off the wall. I stepped out of the lodge, walked through some pine, and I was in a pipeline. There was a big pipe coming in and out of the ground as far as I could see. ''I had no idea what the hell that was all about,'' Wiggins continued. But he said the dream became clearer when a stranger named Matt Fifield came into his office several months later and handed him his card. Wiggins is the chairman of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, and Fifield, the managing director of Gogebic Taconite (GTac), a division of the Cline Group, a mining company based in Florida. He had come to Wiggins's office to discuss GTac's desire to build a $1.5 billion open-pit iron-ore mine in the Penokee Hills, about seven miles south of the Bad River reservation. The proposed mine would be several hundred feet deep, roughly four miles long and a half-mile wide; the company estimated it would bring 700 long-term jobs to the area. Fearing contamination of the local groundwater and pristine rivers, Wiggins told Fifield he planned to oppose the mine. He didn't know at the time that the company's lawyers would be working hand in hand with Republican legislators to draft a bill that would weaken Wisconsin environmental law and expedite the permitting process."

In his latest, the wondrous storybook tale ''Moonrise Kingdom,'' a girl and a boy, both 12, run off to a remote inlet on an island where most of the adults seem disappointed and more than a little sad. The girl and the boy are very serious -- about love, their plans, books, life itself -- and often act older than their age. She wears bright blue eyeliner; he puffs on a corncob pipe. You wonder what their hurry is, given that here adulthood, with its quarrels, regrets and anguished pillow talk, can feel as dangerous as the storm that's hurtling toward the island, ready to blow it all down. The two young romantics in ''Moonrise Kingdom,'' which opened the 65th Cannes Film Festival on May 16, are gifted and, according to grown-ups who are supposed to know about such things, problem children. Suzy (Kara Hayward) definitely knows this about herself because she discovered a copy of a pamphlet, ''Coping With the Very Troubled Child,'' on top of the family fridge. She does have a temper, but she also has three younger brothers, which may help explain her tantrums. Yet, like many characters in Mr. Anderson's films, she's also troubled on a deeper level, beset by an existential despair that waned when, while getting ready for a performance of Benjamin Britten's opera ''Noye's Fludde'' a year earlier, she met her match, her soul mate, her co-conspirator, Sam (Jared Gilman)."

That is because they recently fought back a proposal that threatened to chip away at the ''dry'' status that many consider an equally defining element of this South Jersey community. Earlier this month, more than half of Ocean City's 9,000 registered voters cast ballots on an ordinance that would have allowed diners to take their own beer or wine to restaurants in town. Defeated by a two-to-one ratio, the vote puts to rest, at least for now, a longstanding debate between those seeking to prop up the business district with proactive moves like this one and those eager to preserve the town's traditionalist values."
2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"THE French aided the Americans in their revolution against their British oppressors. Now Benoît Pous-Bertran de Balanda, the descendant of a French general who fought for the Americans, is trying to help his wealthy countrymen escape what he calls the tyranny of a new Socialist government primed to severely tax the rich. And France's loss could be New York's gain."
2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"OVER the past 20 years, chimpanzees, gorillas and other great apes have declined the most in areas lacking a security force to protect them. Conversely, parks and protected areas with armed guards and anti-poaching patrols -- places like Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park in the Republic of Congo, Kahuzi-Biega National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda -- have not only retained their ape populations, but have seen population increases. This connection extends beyond great apes. The Albertine Rift in Central Africa has over the past 50 years demonstrated the benefits of a close tie between law enforcement and the survival of diverse species. In Asia, the government's training and deployment of park guards in Thailand's most important reserve, the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, has led to seven years of population stability in tigers and other wildlife, in contrast to dramatic declines in nearby unprotected parks."

2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"By Friday morning the cargo capsule built by SpaceX, a private company, may (or may not) have docked with the International Space Station. After Tuesday's launch of the Falcon 9, the rocket carrying the capsule, SpaceX's chief executive, Elon Musk, said at a news conference, ''We're really at the dawn of a new era of space exploration and one where there's a much bigger role for commercial companies.'' Meanwhile, another private company, one operated by the artist Tom Sachs, is gearing up for an imaginary manned expedition to Mars. Preparations for that voyage, including all the equipment Mr. Sachs and his team will need, are on display in ''Space Program: Mars,'' an exhibition at the Park Avenue Armory that is expansive and diverting but not as imaginative or conceptually provocative or as much fun it ought to be. It is produced and curated by the Armory and Creative Time."

2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"Throughout his maiden trip to the N.H.L. playoffs, Stephen Gionta has communicated daily with big brother Brian, who hoisted the Stanley Cup for the Devils in 2003 and now serves as captain of the Montreal Canadiens. The postseason is a grind, Brian has told him, and it stokes emotions he did not even know he could feel. There was something else Brian mentioned. ''Anything can happen,'' said Stephen Gionta, and he spoke those words without any hint of a smile or a twinkle or a laugh, of any reaction that suggested how truthful that statement was Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden."
2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"Heinrich Kuehn (1866-1944), a Viennese photographer active at the turn of the 20th century, was one of the medium's great control freaks. Consider the routine he went through when taking pictures of his family: He selected a site and sketched it in pencil, had his children and their nanny assume specific poses in clothing he had preselected for its photogenic qualities, and waited until every shadow was right where he wanted it to be. Those photographs are some of the most memorable images in ''Heinrich Kuehn and His American Circle: Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen,'' at the Neue Galerie, a thorny survey of a little-known Austrian Pictorialist who made contact with, and was influenced by, two of photography's trans-Atlantic machers. (It coincides with two gallery shows on Kuehn, at Howard Greenberg and Hans P. Kraus Jr. Fine Photographs.)"
2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"In American movies male friendship is commonly explored within the familiar parameters of the buddy comedy -- where yucks tend to trump insights -- or through the heavily structured formula of the rookie-mentor relationship. In both iterations honest emotions are often obscured, whether by raucous humor or a passing-the-torch sentimentality that's comfortingly clichéd. ''Redlegs'' is a different animal altogether. Spread over a single weekend in present-day Cincinnati, this debut feature from Brandon Harris, unabashedly influenced by John Cassavetes's ''Husbands,'' dives into shared grief with candor and a refreshing curiosity. Reuniting three childhood friends for the funeral of a fourth, the film is a riveting portrait of young men in shock and in mourning as the tragedy stirs feelings that have long lain dormant. As the men distract themselves with batting cages and pool tables, women and cocaine, the actors never flinch from dialogue so raw and close-ups so clinging that they have nowhere to hide."
2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The Syrian Foreign Ministry on Thursday indirectly denied persistent rumors that President Bashar al-Assad's brother-in-law, a member of the secretive inner circle governing the country, was fatally poisoned by the opposition. The oblique method of the denial -- in a Facebook posting -- was just the latest strange twist in a cloak-and-dagger tale that has been circulating for five days and that has been impossible to confirm or refute. The struggle to spread, or halt, the rumor that Mr. Assad's brother-in-law, Asef Shawkat, was killed represents the most high-profile chapter in the war of narratives between the two sides."
2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"RICHARD JOHNSTON used to rent out his two-bedroom farmhouse in southern France in a way that seems quaint two decades later: by buying advertising in publications like Harvard's alumni magazine or The New York Review of Books and waiting for Francophiles to respond.

''The season lasted from May until October, and I would get 15 weeks rented.''"

But there was Jay Carney, the presidential press secretary, on Wednesday telling reporters aboard Air Force One that Mr. Hoover was a more profligate spender than President Obama. Clearly unimpressed by the questions he was getting from reporters, Mr. Carney volunteered an extensive and robust answer to one that was not asked, defending Mr. Obama against Republican charges of fiscal recklessness. He read a passage from Rex Nutting of MarketWatch stating that spending under Mr. Obama had grown even more slowly than under Mr. Hoover."

The Iranians wanted an easing of the onerous economic sanctions imposed by the West and recognition of what they call their right to enrich."

The list of 50 candidates includes some officials considered allies of Mr. Bo, but excludes Mr. Bo himself. Political experts in China are scrutinizing the lists of the candidates and those already named as delegates to the conference, the 18th Party Congress, for signs of fallout from the seismic scandal over Mr. Bo."

Caro's biography of Lyndon Johnson (May 6), that ''L.B.J. got to me'' (and therefore he ''never hated'' him as ''many young people'' of his generation did) is not quite true. Certainly L.B.J. tried to get to him, as he got to so many other young men -- with that ominous ''Greetings'' letter conscripting them into the military -- but clever Mr. Clinton managed to wriggle out of that predicament and go on to wealth and power, instead of having his future put at risk in the most squalid, ruinous and futile of Johnson's Brobdingnagian federal projects."

2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"In the wake of a devastating financial crisis, President Obama has enacted some modest and obviously needed regulation; he has proposed closing a few outrageous tax loopholes; and he has suggested that Mitt Romney's history of buying and selling companies, often firing workers and gutting their pensions along the way, doesn't make him the right man to run America's economy. Wall Street has responded -- predictably, I suppose -- by whining and throwing temper tantrums. And it has, in a way, been funny to see how childish and thin-skinned the Masters of the Universe turn out to be. Remember when Stephen Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group compared a proposal to limit his tax breaks to Hitler's invasion of Poland? Remember when Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase characterized any discussion of income inequality as an attack on the very notion of success?"
2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"As Washington intensifies its scrutiny of the initial public offering of Facebook, the company's bankers are facing questions about whether the process - even if perfectly legal - was fair.

2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"At 5 p.m. on a Sunday evening, the comedians started to arrive at the auditorium in Katara, the fake-old-looking development in Doha, Qatar. Eight of them were scheduled to perform that night, and Bilal Randeree, the 29-year-old leader of Stand Up Comedy Qatar, was worrying about the possibility that someone might joke about Islam or the emir or sex, which most of them say they have never had. ''There was an incident,'' said Issa El-Fahoum, who is Palestinian and, at 15, the youngest member of SUCQ, which everyone pronounces ''suck.'' Mohanalakshmi Rajakumar, who is in her 30s and the only woman and non-Muslim regularly performing in SUCQ, nodded. ''There was an incident,'' she said. A few weeks earlier, SUCQ hosted an open-mike night, and a Brit showed up who apparently didn't know his audience -- which included a smattering of women in head scarves and men in white robes. For 10 minutes, he talked about being a sperm donor. ''People were actually audibly groaning,'' Rajakumar said."

Mr. Phillips is a secret sophisticate, often going to great lengths to mask his evident gift. Throughout the season he was shy and humble, even as his fingers, as applied to his guitar, displayed serious dexterity, and his voice, scratchy and earthy, showed real range and power. Generally, when he was allowed to choose his own songs, he went small. He covered Damien Rice and the Box Tops and, with a straight face, Matchbox Twenty. Offered fashion advice, he stuck to his guns, which is to say he smiled, then ignored. On Tuesday night, while the other finalist, Jessica Sanchez, was dressed for a pageant, Mr. Phillips was dressed for a kegger."
2012-05-24T00:00:00Z,"The Neue Galerie is dedicated, with religious single-mindedness, to the cause of Austrian and German modernism. Like any church, it has its patron saints; Gustav Klimt is one. And it has its sacred objects, notably Klimt's 1907 portrait of the Viennese socialite Adele Bloch-Bauer, a picture with the visual heft and cultish allure of a reliquary. Painter and portrait alike are the centerpieces of ''Gustav Klimt: 150th Anniversary Celebration.'' Full-orchestra salutes to the artist's birthday -- Klimt was born in Vienna in 1862 -- are happening in Europe. But with 7 paintings, 40 drawings, a couple of posters and some photographs, this New York tribute is on a chamber-music scale, as befits the Neue Galerie's town house quarters."

It died as a music festival in the mid-1990s, a victim of competition from regional festivals it had inspired, like South by Southwest in Texas and the CMJ Music Marathon in New York. But over the last four years, one of the founders of the original New Music Seminar, Tom Silverman, has resurrected the yearly business conference in hopes of generating ideas for changing the way musicians and labels make money. And this year, he has added a music festival that will be staged from June 17 through June 20."

Meanwhile, another private company, one operated by the artist Tom Sachs, is gearing up for an imaginary manned expedition to Mars. Preparations for that voyage, including all the equipment Mr. Sachs and his team will need, are on display in ''Space Program: Mars,'' an exhibition at the Park Avenue Armory that is expansive and diverting but not as imaginative or conceptually provocative or as much fun it ought to be. It is sponsored by Creative Time."

In another era, Mr. Delaney might have tried to start a restaurant or a wholesale product line. Instead, on April 21 he posted an offer to his social media contacts, inviting them to register for a limited supply of handcrafted barbecue, $25 a pound, to be served at unspecified events in the future."

2012-05-25T00:00:00Z,"THE North Fork Oyster Company, a restaurant that opened about a year ago in Greenport, is an homage to the oyster industry on the East End; there are more than two dozen oyster farms in the area, according to the executive chef, Alex Algieri. Diners approaching the restaurant see a chef in the window opening oysters and otherwise tending the raw bar. Situated in a former stable dating from the 1840s, the L-shaped dining room includes the bar and seats about 70, with a covered brick patio accommodating an additional 60. Tables are topped with white bistro paper and votive candles. A nautical atmosphere is created by large, framed photographs of oyster boats and other fishermen and maritime scenes. The couple who own the North Fork Oyster Company, Farouk and Sana Ahmed, are first-time restaurateurs; Mr. Algieri previously cooked at Wild Thyme in Southampton (since closed) and the American Hotel in Sag Harbor. Nearly every dish sampled was a winner."

2012-05-25T00:00:00Z,"Poll results in three swing states show President Obama and Mitt Romney in tight races in Florida and Virginia, and the president with a six-point advantage in Ohio. In surveys conducted by NBC News/Marist from May 17 to May 20, voters in all three states said the economy outweighed social issues by a wide margin in deciding whom to vote for. And again, in all three states, voters were divided on which candidate would do a better job handling the economy."
2012-05-25T00:00:00Z,"The gloomy caves, turbulent seas and wafting breezes of a faraway island cocoon the inhabitants, human and otherwise, of Shakespeare's last great play, ''The Tempest.'' But in the vivid new Hartford Stage production, the director, Darko Tresnjak, has banished this natural world and replaced it with an ocean of words, words, words. Taken from the text and copied in flowing Renaissance script, words pour down the back wall and across the stage floor designed by Alexander Dodge. They spill over the furniture and splash onto several of Fabio Toblini's costumes, sometimes blue on white, sometimes white on blue, always visible somewhere in the stage picture."
2012-05-25T00:00:00Z,"The United States quietly passed a milestone this spring, mostly lost amid the clamor of the presidential race: for the first time, neither party's candidate is a white Protestant. The contenders are both from outsider groups that were once persecuted, and despite Harvard degrees and notable successes, both men have felt the sting of being treated as somehow strange or different. The campaigns have mostly been in a state of détente on identity politics, trying to avoid mutually assured destruction. But the outsider backgrounds of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have marked the race in subtler ways, shaping the candidates and campaigns, causing them to mirror each other in many ways."
2012-05-25T00:00:00Z,"Among the brand-name French theorists of the mid-20th century, Roland Barthes was the fun one. (Foucault was the tough one, Derrida was the dreamy one, Lacan was the mysterious one -- I like to imagine them sometimes as a black-turtlenecked, clove-smoking boy band called Hors de Texte, with the hit album ''Discipline 'n' Punish.'') Instead of constructing multivolume monuments of systematic thought, Barthes wrote short books built out of fragments. He was less interested in traditional coherence than in what he called jouissance: joy, surprise, adventure, pleasure -- tantric orgasms of critical insight rolling from fragment to fragment. He proclaimed the death of the author and advocated a style of reading he referred to as ''writerly,'' in which readers work as active creators of a text. His critical metabolism ran unusually high: he would flit from subject to subject, defining new fields of interest (semiology, narratology) only to abandon them and leave others to do the busywork. He treated canonical French works with such unorthodox flair it drove conservative professors crazy. (Barthes first rose to prominence, or notoriety, thanks to the furor surrounding his early book about Racine.) In his inaugural lecture at the Collège de France -- a sort of mission statement for the most prestigious academic post in the country -- Barthes announced that he aspired above all to ''forget'' and to ''unlearn'' and proposed, as a kind of motto, ''no power, a little knowledge, a little wisdom and as much flavor as possible.'' The most reliable and user-friendly source of Barthes's special variety of fun -- the bouillon cube, if you will, of his critical flavor -- is his early book ''Mythologies,'' originally published in 1957. In it, Barthes basically invented what we think of as cultural criticism: he was the first really first-rate intellectual to tell us what our most mundane pop culture actually means. For decades, however, only part of ''Mythologies'' was available in English. Its recent rerelease in a new and (for the first time) complete translation gives us an excuse not only to reread the book but also to consider some of the larger questions it raises, nearly 60 years later, for those of us still swimming through pop culture, and in particular for those of us who consider ourselves critics of that culture, which, these days, seems to be just about everyone."

2012-05-25T00:00:00Z,"For their shared program at Danspace Project, Andrew Dinwiddie and Michelle Ellsworth have scrutinized the act of transformation in two virtuosic solos. Mr. Dinwiddie is a rock star who turns into an object of worship in ''Farewell Tour.'' And Ms. Ellsworth, in a 120-pound, 5-foot-wide and 9-foot-high costume in ''The Pythagodress,'' becomes a wearable, portable set. The costume enables Ms. Ellsworth to morph into different looks and is credited to Priscilla Cohan, Janice Lacek and Bruce Miller.

2012-05-25T00:00:00Z,"The history of capital punishment in this country has had many horrifying turnings, few more macabre than a warning from states employing lethal injection that a federal court ruling has left them facing a shortage of the imported drug they rely on to kill death-row felons. The scarcity arose after the one domestic manufacturer stopped making sodium thiopental in 2010. In March, Judge Richard Leon of Federal District Court in Washington blocked the importation of the drug, ruling the Food and Drug Administration had not approved it for ''safety and effectiveness,'' as required for imports. The F.D.A.'s position was that reviewing such a drug designed for death ''clearly falls outside of F.D.A.'s explicit public health role.''"

If you do, you will find good food, nicely presented by attentive servers. And you will manage to avoid the excesses that marred my first meal here. The restaurant was opened in August by three cousins, Francesco Ippoliti, Mario Esposito and Anna Bevilacqua, for whom the restaurant is named. Mr. Ippoliti said on the phone after my visits that he and Mr. Esposito had trained in the culinary arts in their native Italy, then immigrated here about 10 years ago, and that Ms. Bevilacqua, who is the office manager, grew up in an Italian family in New York. The restaurant was a long-held dream, he said."
2012-05-25T00:00:00Z,"From the start, I made it clear to the man with whom I was involved that I cared deeply about being safe from sexually transmitted diseases. He assured me he would be loyal and agreed that if he strayed, he would not have unprotected sex. He lied. He had sex with three women without using condoms. He has agreed to get tested but not to tell the other women about one another. They all believe him to be in a monogamous relationship with me. Two of the women are our age (we're in our 60s); the third is younger. I know all three women via Facebook. Do I have an ethical obligation to tell them about his activities? NAME WITHHELD You do not. Unless you learn that your lover has a sexually transmitted disease and he refuses to disclose that information to his other lovers, there is nothing for you to tell them that they don't already know. They're aware that this man is not monogamous and also that he doesn't practice protected sex. Indeed, all three women agreed to do the same when they opted to have unprotected sex with him knowing he was also having sex with you. My hunch is you don't really want to tell these women about your lover's tomcatting ways because you fear he has spread a disease, but rather that you're hurt and angry about his betrayal and you want to punish him (and possibly the women too). That's perfectly understandable but a losing prospect nonetheless."

But in 1994 it didn't end up working out well for New Jersey.

Her oncologist, whom I knew from the time I was 9 years old, was her doctor for most of that time. I practically grew up in the hospital, and my family felt quite close to the health care providers, especially the oncologist. After my mother died I wondered if the feeling was mutual. Do doctors grieve when their patients die? In the medical profession, such grief is seldom discussed -- except, perhaps, as an example of the sort of emotion that a skilled doctor avoids feeling. But in a paper published on Tuesday in Archives of Internal Medicine (and in a forthcoming paper in the journal Death Studies), my colleagues and I report what we found in our research about oncologists and patient loss: Not only do doctors experience grief, but the professional taboo on the emotion also has negative consequences for the doctors themselves, as well as for the quality of care they provide."

There are, of course, things by the superstars of the title. Giovanni Bellini's ''Pietà with the Virgin and Saint John,'' dated between 1455 and 1460, is a mournful complement to his later ''Madonna and Child,'' which is in the Met's collection. The single Titian is the very early ''Orpheus and Eurydice,'' thought to have been done between 1508 and 1512. And from Lorenzo Lotto we have a charming portrait of Lucina Brembati, who wears a large jeweled toothpick on a gold chain around her neck. Less familiar sights are three smallish narrative paintings from a Lotto altarpiece that has not traveled.

Since September he has been The Times's Washington bureau chief. In his writing as in his career, Leonhardt has positioned himself at the intersection of economics and politics, viewing issues with a skeptical but pragmatic eye. As he said in his final column last summer, ''We do not spend enough time focusing on our actual economic problems. We are too often occupied with distractions, rather than trying to answer a simple question: What works? What economic policies have succeeded before and are most likely to lead to the best life for the largest number of people? Instead, we've effectively decided that because the United States is the richest, most successful country in the world, it is guaranteed to remain so.'' Which policies are most likely to succeed according to Leonhardt? His answer has an obvious connection to the division between Hamiltonians and Jeffersonians that Michael Lind highlights in his book ''Land of Promise,'' which Leonhardt reviews this week. Leonhardt writes, ''When it comes to economics, we know that a market economy with a significant government role is the only proven model of success.''"

With Alan Gilbert on the podium, Mr. Kissin was the soloist in two big-boned works, Scriabin's early Piano Concerto in F sharp minor, and Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor. The Scriabin is a bona fide rarity and not entirely without justification. Scriabin composed the work in 1896 and was the soloist in the premiere the following year. Its main business is putting his own dazzling pianism on display, and though the distinctive voice and quirky harmonic style that would ring out in his later music are beginning to coalesce here, Scriabin still has a foot in Chopin's world."

And some wrongly accused man is running in terror for his life. Or the ghosts of young lovers are meeting to lament their failure to find happiness in life. Or a huge, mysterious, unseen, baronet-murdering dog that is said to glow like phosphorous is howling into the midnight air. At least now the moors of Devon, England, are a comedy location, too. In the sweetly silly production of ''The Hound of the Baskervilles,'' which has just opened Penguin Rep Theater's 35th season, there is a goofy butler with a tray of plastic food and an obviously fake beard; silly flirtations by an unusually tall, deep-voiced señorita; anachronistic attempts at performing CPR on a dummy; and Londoners who wear towels over their business suits in a steam room. Like ''The 39 Steps,'' which was based on a 1930s Hitchcock film and won three Tonys and two Drama Desk Awards when it hit Broadway, ''Hound'' is a happy spoof of what was once a serious piece of fiction. It began in 1901 as Arthur Conan Doyle's story about a certain self-confident detective, one Sherlock Holmes, investigating a murder at Baskerville Hall and wondering whether the new heir to the Baskerville fortune is in danger as well.

A picnic sounds wonderful, but somehow, when the blanket is spread over rocky, wet earth, and the warmed potato salad is opened up like an invitation to the flies, when the sea gulls surround you, when you drop your sandwich in the grass, or lightning crackles overhead, the whole thing sours. But the idea remains enticing. Is there a better place to eat with children than outdoors? The pace of a picnic -- picnics are meant to last -- lends itself to wooing. In the Hudson Valley, I found ideal places to picnic, and, after some experimentation, I honed what to take along. The secret: simplicity and luxury."

Until the 1990s, exclusive suburban homes that were accessible only by car cost more, per square foot, than other kinds of American housing. Now, however, these suburbs have become overbuilt, and housing values have fallen. Today, the most valuable real estate lies in walkable urban locations. Many of these now pricey places were slums just 30 years ago."

The government is trying to head off a collapse of the bank, which could threaten the Spanish banking industry and reverberate through the financial centers of Europe and beyond. The fear is that it will not have the money to save its banks, and their $1.25 trillion in deposits, and will need a rescue by the rest of Europe -- even as political and financial leaders struggle to resolve Greece's debt debacle."

Nothing says accessible like something you interact with physically. Such art comes in many guises. It can range from relatively domestic tasks, like cooking a meal, to intricate trompe l'oeil environments that replicate or exaggerate huge chunks of reality.

The Suffolk University/7 News poll put the loss at 25 percentage points, with Mr. Romney winning only 34 percent of the vote in the state where he was once governor. The interesting point is how this fits into history. It turns out to be rare for a candidate who loses his home state to go on and win the presidency. (Some may quibble with the definition of ''home state,'' but it generally refers to the state where the candidate lives, not where he was born.)"
2012-05-25T00:00:00Z,"As mortgage rates have hit one record low after another, millions of homeowners have been forced to watch, longingly, from the sidelines. They haven't had the option of refinancing because sliding home values pushed their mortgages underwater, meaning they owe more than their homes are worth. The banks would just not work with them. Yet many of these borrowers are gainfully employed, have solid credit histories and have never missed a mortgage payment. And they want to stay in their homes -- even if those homes are worth substantially less than they paid. These are the families that President Obama and other political leaders like to call ''responsible'' homeowners."

The decision by Ms. Rousseff, which removes 12 articles from the bill, alters legislation sought by powerful agricultural groups. The bill had provoked outrage among environmentalists, some business leaders and cultural icons, especially over a provision that effectively granted amnesty to landowners who illegally deforested some areas. Responding to these concerns, Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira said the president's line-item vetoes ruled out amnesty. Still, Ms. Rousseff's action fell short of the expectations of environmental groups, which had wanted her to veto the entire bill. Details about the changes to the bill were sparse on Friday, with Brazil's powerful Agriculture and Livestock Confederation withholding comment.

On a day when Britain's newspapers splashed their front pages with accounts of earlier maneuvering to assure approval for the bid by Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, Mr. Cameron appeared on a morning television show to offer a rebuttal of any wrongdoing on his part or by the minister, Jeremy Hunt, who lobbied for the Murdoch bid before Mr. Cameron appointed him to oversee the regulatory process involved."
2012-05-25T00:00:00Z,"CANNES, France -- The Austrian director Michael Haneke has made an art of exploiting audience discomfort. In a sense his new film, ''Amour,'' continues in that vein by staring down the least palatable of subjects: aging, sickness and death. But the universal specter of mortality has brought with it a tenderness seldom seen in Mr. Haneke's cool, analytical cinema, and the film remains the closest thing to a consensus favorite among critics at the Cannes Film Festival here. As the festival enters its final weekend, ''Amour'' also looks like a strong contender for a top prize at the awards ceremony on Sunday. (Mr. Haneke's previous film, ''The White Ribbon,'' took the Palme d'Or in 2009.)"

Ms. Summer, who won five Grammy Awards during a career that spanned some 30 years, died of cancer on May 17 at her home in Naples, Fla. She was 63. Among those who paid tribute to Ms. Summer at the memorial service, The A.P. said, were the producer David Foster (he had worked with Ms. Summer since the early 1980s), who sang ''The Prayer'' with Natalie Grant. Giorgio Moroder, who produced songs for Ms. Summer like ''Love to Love You Baby'' was also in attendance, as was Tony Orlando.

While designers are swaddling and coddling customers in fondly retooled visions of yesteryear -- just pick a decade -- some designers are trying to take a blindfolded whack at the future. Some hit the piñata, and some hit the wall. If you were to pay a visit to Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, the two young men behind the fashion line Proenza Schouler, at the country house they share in the Berkshires in Western Massachusetts, you would assume they belonged to the yesteryear school. The house is a clapboard center-hall Colonial built in 1792 and sits on 100 acres of woods and pastures speckled with grazing cows and pigs from neighboring farms."

Mr. Ebert started the band in California with the singer Jade Castrinos; their romance was captured on their 2009 debut album, ''Up From Below,'' in tracks like the hit single ''Home.'' As they and their many bandmates spent the last few years on tour, building a fan base with their stirring live shows -- audience members dance ecstatically, Mr. Ebert joining in, until he beckons them to sit in a circle around him for a quiet song -- singles like ''Home'' and ''Janglin' '' had a steady presence on TV and on movie soundtracks.

2012-05-25T00:00:00Z,"WHEN economic waters are rough -- or perhaps just to shake things up in times of stagnation -- musical institutions try to redefine themselves, sharpen their sense of mission and do some image tweaking. That can be hard when your mission is already unusual and clearly defined. But the American Composers Orchestra, which has been putting a spotlight on (mostly contemporary) American music since 1977, has lately been reinventing itself as a hybrid performing ensemble and service organization. ''I think of the A.C.O. a little bit like the Bronx Zoo,'' Michael Geller, the orchestra's executive director, said recently. ''If you didn't know anything about zoos, and I asked you what its mission was, you would say, 'It looks like a place where grandparents take children to entertain themselves while they're getting to observe living creatures.' But of course their mission is not that. Their mission is environmental. It's about protecting species. It's about doing research. The zoo is the public face of it, and that's important. Clearly if it were just a research center, it wouldn't be the same."

In short, we've lost touch with the lurid traditions of the 19th-century potboiler. Consider THE YARD (Putnam, $26.95) a crude corrective to those literary leanings. This deliciously trashy first novel by Alex Grecian walks the genre back to the era of Jack the Ripper with its bloody tale of a serial killer who is systematically butchering detectives from Scotland Yard's recently formed Murder Squad. ''Jack was the first of a new breed,'' Sir Edward Bradford, the police commissioner who created this elite division, remarks. ''He opened a door to certain deranged possibilities and there will be more like him.''"

(A&E) PAUL SIMON'S GRACELAND JOURNEY: UNDER AFRICAN SKIES (2012) The filmmaker Joe Berlinger celebrates the 25th anniversary of ''Graceland,'' a masterwork by Mr. Simon (above center), while examining that singer-songwriter's decision to travel to apartheid-era Johannesburg in 1985 to record South African musicians during a cultural boycott of that country. ''The film's happiest moment is its clip of a 'Saturday Night Live' performance of 'Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,' by Mr. Simon with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, that preceded the album's release,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''This sparkling, buoyant performance reminds you that great music outlasts the politics of the moment.'' 11:10 A.M. (Sundance) FLIGHT OF THE RED BALLOON (2008) The Taiwanese master Hou Hsiao-hsien creates a love letter to Paris -- and to Albert Lamorisse's 1956 classic, ''The Red Balloon'' -- in this tale about Suzanne (Juliette Binoche, left), a puppeteer; her lonely 7-year-old son, Simon (Simon Iteanu); and Song (Song Fang), a Chinese film student hired to be his nanny. ''In the end what elevates Mr. Hou's films to the sublime -- and this one comes close at times -- are not the stories but their telling,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times. ''In 'Flight of the Red Balloon' Mr. Hou plays with light and space on the small canvas that is Simon and Suzanne's apartment, moving the camera around as gracefully as if it were a brush (or a balloon).'' In ''The Pool'' (2008), at 1:10 p.m., Venkatesh (Venkatesh Chavan), an Indian teenager on the verge of manhood who ekes out a living cleaning hotel rooms and selling plastic bags on the street, becomes obsessed with the shimmering pool of a luxurious home, where no one seems to swim. Eventually he approaches the property's owner (Nana Patekar) and becomes his assistant; the rich man, in turn, promises to become Venkatesh's benefactor if he will move from Goa to Mumbai and go to school. ''Just when you expect the film to turn into a predictable, rose-colored valentine to opportunity and hope, it goes to a deeper, more ambiguous place,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The Times about this movie by Chris Smith, adapted from a short story by Randy Russell. ''Contemplating poverty from Venkatesh's perspective, it understands that his pursuit of upward mobility will require a terrifying leap of faith.''"

The film, Sunday night on Animal Planet and part of its Monster Week, is a fictional account built on a few strands of fact and made to look like an actual documentary.

Montgomery was issued Patent No. 640,790 for the Fly-Killer, a ''cheap device of unusual elasticity and durability'' made of wire netting, ''preferably oblong,'' attached to a handle. The material of the handle remained unspecified, but the netting was crucial: it reduced wind drag, giving the swatter a ''whiplike swing.'' By 1901, Montgomery's invention was advertised in Ladies' Home Journal as a tool that ''kills without crushing'' and ''soils nothing,'' unlike, say, a rolled-up newspaper might. Montgomery sold the patent rights in 1903 to an industrialist named John L. Bennett, who later invented the beer can. Bennett improved the design -- stitching around the edge of the netting to keep it from fraying -- but left the name."

Though she was a smart and seasoned actress who had worked in film as well as onstage, she was known mainly to Stockholm theatergoers. Her name barely surfaced in the lively public debate in Sweden over who should play Lisbeth, one of the most sought after film roles for a Swedish actress in recent memory. Moreover, the film's director, Niels Arden Oplev, feared that Rapace was too attractive to portray the androgynous Lisbeth. After working through a scene with her, though, he changed his mind. ''When she's Lisbeth and you put a camera on her, and she's just sitting there looking at you, you think, Oh, my God, what is she going to do?'' he says. ''There's an unpredictable, dark, dangerous energy that flows from her.'' Once he cast her, she gave herself over to the task of transforming into the alienated hacker-heroine of Stieg Larsson's ''Millennium'' trilogy, even as the novels' popularity began to snowball outside of Sweden. (The English translation of the first novel came out in 2008.) She trained with a Thai-boxing coach, submitted to multiple piercings and lopped off her hair. Then she shot the three films, one right after the other, over an 18-month period. When the first film opened, in February 2009, journalists from all over Europe descended on Stockholm to see it -- and to see her, the unknown actress charged with interpreting what had suddenly become one of the world's most popular characters."
2012-05-25T00:00:00Z,"People have snickered for years about ''Cats,'' suggesting that the reason the show became the second-longest-running hit in Broadway history (after ''The Phantom of the Opera'') was that the dance-driven extravaganza was an ideal attraction for tourists who did not speak English.

Certainly, they will see a capably performed ''Cats'' at the Gateway Playhouse, which previously presented the musical in 2004. It is directed and choreographed this time by Jacob Brent, who performed in ''Cats'' on Broadway, in London and in the DVD version. The current revival in Bellport is a smaller-scale but otherwise fairly faithful rendition of the show, which ran for 7,485 performances at the Winter Garden Theater beginning in 1982, a year after it opened in London."

A partner in the Washington, DC office of Jones Day, one of the nation's leading aviation regulatory lawyers; a man of extraordinary intellect, integrity and humility. Held both of the nation's two top aviation regulatory positions under President George W. Bush. Was a recognized authority on legal issues relating to modernizing air traffic control, aviation and aerospace regulation, aviation and climate change, foreign market access, computerized travel distribution. From 2006 until 2008, was Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Aviation and International Affairs; from 2003 to 2006 was Chief Counsel of the Federal Aviation Administration. He was Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Travelocity.com from inception of the company in 2000 until 2003. From 1996 to 2000 he was Executive Vice President and General Counsel of SABRE, which he guided through separation from American Airlines to a public company in 2000. From 1990 to 1996 held senior legal positions at American Airlines, as Associate General Counsel for employment and environmental and Senior Attorney for antitrust. Prior to 1990 Andy was an associate in the Los Angeles office of Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher, practicing antitrust and commercial litigation. During his tenure at the U.S. Dept of Transportation, led the department's efforts to secure open skies agreement with the E.U. and helped negotiate agreement with China that doubled the number of routes between China and the U.S. With U.S. Depts. of State and Treasury, directed the Civil Aviation delegation of the first China-U.S. Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) in 2006 led by then-Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson. He led the U.S. delegation in Montreal during the 2007 International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly, defending the U.S. position on aviation and climate change, for which he was later awarded the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award (now known as the Montreal Protocol Award) from the Environmental Protection Agency. At the FAA, promoted the use of satellite based air traffic systems to modernize air traffic control and improve safety in the U.S. and abroad, and was instrumental in spearheading FAA's legal strategy in protracted labor negotiations with air traffic controllers. While at Travelocity, he had the unusual distinction of being awarded a citation from the F.B.I. for work pursuing information about the transactions of an infamous Travelocity customer, Muhammad Atta, a 9/11 hijacker who used Travelocity.com to make reservations for air and car travel in the months leading up to the attacks. That information later proved useful in leading to the arrests of Al-Qaida terrorists in Spain and Germany. Earlier in his career, he represented American Airlines in defeating claims of predatory pricing and monopolization by Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines. Andy was born in Perth Amboy, NJ, grew up in Scarsdale and graduated from Edgemont High School. He earned his A.B. from Princeton in 1980, and J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1984, after teaching English in Japan through Princeton-in-Asia. He clerked for the Honorable Richard H. Gadbois, Jr., in the U.S. District Court in the Central District of California. Andy served as president of the International Aviation Club of Washington, D.C., on the governing committee of the ABA Air and Space Law Forum, on the Board of the Empower African Children Foundation, and volunteered for Boy Scout Troop 52 in Chevy Chase. Andy loved bicycling around Washington, DC and the country roads near his home in Falls Village. His main hobby was being with his family, sharing music, travel, and well-written comedy; a quick, wry wit, he was a well-qualified critic. A devoted husband and father, Andy leaves and will forever be mourned by his wife Roxann, daughter Madeline and son Malcolm, his brother and sister-in-law, Laurence and Wendy Steinberg, of Philadelphia; his nephew, Benjamin Steinberg, of New York City, and will be sorely missed by friends, colleagues, and admirers worldwide.

While some executives spoke out against it as individuals, not one Fortune 500 company based in North Carolina, including Bank of America, Duke Energy, VF Corporation and Lowe's, opposed it. But one company did: Replacements Limited, which sells silver, china and glassware, and is based in Greensboro. Its founder and chairman, Bob Page, is gay. The company lobbied legislators, contributed money to causes supporting gay marriage, rented a billboard along the interstate near its headquarters, and sold T-shirts at its showroom.

It was 1962. I was 6 and perched on my dad's shoulders. One Sunday some 40 years later, I opened this newspaper to find confirmation of that gauzy memory: a photograph, taken from the south side of 161st Street.

Unless, of course, you are certain it is the cult filmmaker John Waters, thumbing his way across the country in search of material for a new book. This is not as improbable as it might sound. In recent days an indie-rock band from Brooklyn, a married couple from Illinois and a young lawmaker from Maryland have all reported unexpected road encounters with Mr. Waters, the 66-year-old writer and director of such willfully trashy movies as ''Desperate Living,'' ''Polyester'' and ''Hairspray.''"

The plan calls for a negotiated political settlement that would satisfy Syrian opposition groups but that could leave remnants of Mr. Assad's government in place. Its goal is the kind of transition under way in Yemen, where after months of violent unrest, President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to step down and hand control to his vice president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, in a deal arranged by Yemen's Arab neighbors. Mr. Hadi, though later elected in an uncontested vote, is viewed as a transitional leader."

All this ruckus is rooted in tradition, so that one trader isn't likely to be offended by another bellowing at him on the exchange floor -- assuming not too much spittle is involved.

It moves you. It also speaks to a way in which Obama and Mitt Romney, whose campaigns are picking up the pace just as polls show them neck and neck, are profoundly mismatched. In a story that quickly went viral, The Times's Jackie Calmes wrote last week about the photograph, which was taken three years ago when the boy, then 5, visited the White House. It has hung there ever since, left on the wall even as other pictures were swapped out, as is the custom, for newer, fresher ones."

Held both of the nation's two top aviation regulatory positions under President George W. Bush.

From 2006 until 2008, was Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Aviation and International Affairs; from 2003 to 2006 was Chief Counsel of the Federal Aviation Administration. He was Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Travelocity.com from inception of the company in 2000 until 2003. From 1996 to 2000 he was Executive Vice President and General Counsel of SABRE, which he guided through separation from American Airlines to a public company in 2000. From 1990 to 1996 held senior legal positions at American Airlines, as Associate General Counsel for employment and environmental and Senior Attorney for antitrust. Prior to 1990 Andy was an associate in the Los Angeles office of Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher, practicing antitrust and commercial litigation. During his tenure at the U.S. Dept of Transportation, led the department's efforts to secure open skies agreement with the E.U. and helped negotiate agreement with China that doubled the number of routes between China and the U.S. With U.S. Depts. of State and Treasury, directed the Civil Aviation delegation of the first China-U.S. Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) in 2006 led by then-Treasury Secretary Henry M.

While at Travelocity, he had the unusual distinction of being awarded a citation from the F.B.I. for work pursuing information about the transactions of an infamous Travelocity customer, Muhammad Atta, a 9/11 hijacker who used Travelocity.com to make reservations for air and car travel in the months leading up to the attacks. That information later proved useful in leading to the arrests of Al-Qaida terrorists in Spain and Germany. Earlier in his career, he represented American Airlines in defeating claims of predatory pricing and monopolization by Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines. Andy was born in Perth Amboy, NJ, grew up in Scarsdale and graduated from Edgemont High School. He earned his A.B. from Princeton in 1980, and J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1984, after teaching English in Japan through Princeton-in-Asia. He clerked for the Honorable Richard H.

Andy served as president of the International Aviation Club of Washington, D.C., on the governing committee of the ABA Air and Space Law Forum, on the Board of the Empower African Children Foundation, and volunteered for Boy Scout Troop 52 in Chevy Chase. Andy loved bicycling around Washington, DC and the country roads near his home in Falls Village.

A devoted husband and father, Andy leaves and will forever be mourned by his wife Roxann, daughter Madeline and son Malcolm, his brother and sister-in-law, Laurence and Wendy Steinberg, of Philadelphia; his nephew, Benjamin Steinberg, of New York City, and will be sorely missed by friends, colleagues, and admirers worldwide.

His latest film is ''The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,'' which opened in theaters nationwide this week. READING One of my favorite books right now is called ''Animal's People,'' by Indra Sinha. It's about this awful event in India called the Bhopal gas tragedy. There's another book I am reading called ''The White Tiger,'' by Aravind Adiga, about a poor kid who becomes a driver to a rich actor. They are very India-centric and cool and gritty, funny books. Dark humor is the common theme between them."

It is a measure of the problem's complexity that officials can find little comfort even in the news this month that blight and bad weather are slashing this year's poppy harvest in the south. They know from past seasons that blight years lead to skyrocketing opium prices and even greater planting efforts to come."

Their stunned expressions said they had no idea how Adam Henrique had poked home the winning goal, how the Devils had ended their season in overtime of Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals. The view from close up, it turns out, was the worst view of all. From their vantage point, the Rangers could not see how the tables had been turned on them in this series, could not understand how the Devils had become the better team by being faster and deeper, how the grinding style that earned the Rangers the No. 1 seed would no longer serve to make them so dangerous in the playoffs."

It took longer than Celtics fans expected when the series started, but Boston will finally have another chance at LeBron James and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference finals. The Celtics were extended to seven games in the conference semifinals by the eighth-seeded Philadelphia 76ers before holding on for an 85-75 victory in Saturday's deciding game."

2012-05-26T00:00:00Z,"MAYBE because I grew up in New York with artist parents, I always saw the city as the obvious place to live a creative life. I went to college in Northern California partly to get away from the constant flow of creative energy -- and pressure -- in New York, but it didn't occur to me until I returned home that I might need to be out of the city in order to sustain my creative spirit. Though my income barely supports my need for food, art materials and rented time in a studio space, I'm one of the lucky ones: I live rent-free, with my dad, David Byrne, at least for the time being. And, surprisingly, he's a pretty ideal roommate: he cooks dinner, is fun to talk to and completely condones my creative messes -- though it gets a little uncomfortable (for me) doing most of my studio work in his living room, where I've been known to spill rubber mold mix all over the table. Many of my friends who are artists find menial freelance jobs during the year so that they can afford to escape in the summertime to recharge their creativity. They'll use the off time to create artwork they hope to get into galleries, which will sustain them through another winter of menial freelance work. Not everyone succeeds with this kind of strategy, which doesn't seem entirely viable or long-term, especially if you don't have the freedom of freelance work and are tied to a 9 to 5 job."
2012-05-26T00:00:00Z,"THIS summer the city's Department of Transportation inaugurates a new bike-share program. People who live and work in New York will be able to travel quickly and cheaply between many neighborhoods. This is major. It will make New Yorkers rethink their city and rewrite the mental maps we use to decide what is convenient, what is possible. Parks, restaurants and friends who once seemed beyond plausible commuting distance on public transportation will seem a lot closer. The possibilities aren't limitless, but the change will be pretty impressive. I've used a bike to get around New York for decades. There's an exhilaration you get from self-propelled transportation -- skateboarding, in-line skating and walking as well as biking; New York has good public transportation, but you just don't get the kind of rush I'm talking about on a bus or subway train. I got hooked on biking because it's a pleasure, not because biking lowers my carbon footprint, improves my health or brings me into contact with different parts of the city and new adventures. But it does all these things, too -- and sometimes makes us a little self-satisfied for it; still, the reward is emotional gratification, which trumps reason, as it often does."
2012-05-26T00:00:00Z,"American business has always chafed at regulation, but rarely have the cries of outrage been as shrill as during the Obama administration. The United States Chamber of Commerce has moaned of a ''regulatory tsunami of unprecedented force'' issuing from Washington. Every Republican candidate this year has run on an antiregulatory platform, and one of the loudest has been Mitt Romney, who has promised to immediately tear down President Obama's ''vast edifice of regulations.'' That is not surprising, since Mr. Romney's campaign is being bankrolled by big-business interests. The industries making unlimited donations to pro-Romney ''super PACs'' would prefer that Americans not be reminded that government regulations keep the air and water clean, improve the safety of consumer products, reduce workplace hazards, and prevent destructive financial practices."

(Cinemax) BEGINNERS (2011) Christopher Plummer, above, in his Oscar-winning role, plays Hal, the septuagenarian father of Oliver (Ewan McGregor), for whom he has two announcements -- that he is gay and that he has terminal cancer -- in this memory piece from the writer and director Mike Mills, which weaves together two love stories, one past and one present, that gradually fuse into a single life. Goran Visnjic plays Andy, Hal's much younger partner; Mélanie Laurent is Anna, the French actress who sweeps Oliver away from his misery; and a scene-stealing Cosmo is Arthur, Hal's Jack Russell terrier. ''So much of 'Beginners' seems, looks, sounds, feels so hermetically perfect you may long for some air to blow, stir and even mess up its bright Los Angeles homes, the swanky old hotel where Anna stays and all these precious moments,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''Even so, the movie's attractions are undeniable, including its narrative design, which seems more complex than it is, but is engaging to piece together.

The Chinese economy has slowed and its stock indexes have been rocked, while its neighbors have been strengthening their ties with the United States. All this has occurred at the worst possible time for the Communist leadership, as it prepares for what was supposed to be a seamlessly orchestrated transfer of power to a new president, premier and ruling cadre later this year.

2012-05-27T00:00:00Z,"IF you belong to the growing clique of people fascinated by all things Kenneth Lonergan (did you know the three-hour director's cut of ''Margaret'' will be released on DVD in July? Of course you did) then you probably long ago heard rumors about two unlikely sounding plays he has been developing for years. One is about a country singer; the other is a comedy about knights from the Middle Ages that he has been working on since the 1980s. (Hey, it worked for Monty Python!) Both projects intrigue because they are so distant from the contemporary worlds he has sketched in plays like ''The Waverly Gallery'' and ''This is Our Youth'' (both of which could use a Broadway revival) and the movie ''You Can Count on Me.''"

The image of a pensive-looking Jennifer Love Hewitt and her cleavage also suggests the mix of sex and horror used to sell ''The Old Dark House.'' Slasher films are nothing if not formulaic, to their fans' delight."

It was the right venue. Iowa is a leader in wind power, which provides about 20 percent of the state's total electricity, as well as the thousands of jobs that go with it. Renewable energy is faring well across the country, thanks partly to aggressive state governments and timely -- but now imperiled -- subsidies. Clean energy sources would do even better if the Republicans would end their hostility to any form of energy other than fossil fuels. Here's some of the good news:"

2012-05-27T00:00:00Z,"STEINBERG--Andrew, 53, of Chevy Chase, MD and Falls Village, CT, died at home in Chevy Chase on May 20 of uveal melanoma. A partner in the Washington, DC office of Jones Day, one of the nation's leading aviation regulatory lawyers; a man of extraordinary intellect, integrity and humility. Held both of the nation's two top aviation regulatory positions under President George W. Bush. Was a recognized authority on legal issues relating to modernizing air traffic control, aviation and aerospace regulation, aviation and climate change, foreign market access, computerized travel distribution. From 2006 until 2008, was Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Aviation and International Affairs; from 2003 to 2006 was Chief Counsel of the Federal Aviation Administration. He was Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Travelocity.com from inception of the company in 2000 until 2003. From 1996 to 2000 he was Executive Vice President and General Counsel of SABRE, which he guided through separation from American Airlines to a public company in 2000. From 1990 to 1996 held senior legal positions at American Airlines, as Associate General Counsel for employment and environmental and Senior Attorney for antitrust. Prior to 1990 Andy was an associate in the Los Angeles office of Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher, practicing antitrust and commercial litigation. During his tenure at the U.S. Dept of Transportation, led the department's efforts to secure open skies agreement with the E.U. and helped negotiate agreement with China that doubled the number of routes between China and the U.S. With U.S. Depts. of State and Treasury, directed the Civil Aviation delegation of the first China-U.S. Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) in 2006 led by then-Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson. He led the U.S. delegation in Montreal during the 2007 International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly, defending the U.S. position on aviation and climate change, for which he was later awarded the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award (now known as the Montreal Protocol Award) from the Environmental Protection Agency. At the FAA, promoted the use of satellite based air traffic systems to modernize air traffic control and improve safety in the U.S. and abroad, and was instrumental in spearheading FAA's legal strategy in protracted labor negotiations with air traffic controllers. While at Travelocity, he had the unusual distinction of being awarded a citation from the F.B.I. for work pursuing information about the transactions of an infamous Travelocity customer, Muhammad Atta, a 9/11 hijacker who used Travelocity.com to make reservations for air and car travel in the months leading up to the attacks. That information later proved useful in leading to the arrests of Al-Qaida terrorists in Spain and Germany. Earlier in his career, he represented American Airlines in defeating claims of predatory pricing and monopolization by Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines. Andy was born in Perth Amboy, NJ, grew up in Scarsdale and graduated from Edgemont High School. He earned his A.B. from Princeton in 1980, and J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1984, after teaching English in Japan through Princeton-in-Asia. He clerked for the Honorable Richard H. Gadbois, Jr., in the U.S. District Court in the Central District of California. Andy served as president of the International Aviation Club of Washington, D.C., on the governing committee of the ABA Air and Space Law Forum, on the Board of the Empower African Children Foundation, and volunteered for Boy Scout Troop 52 in Chevy Chase. Andy loved bicycling around Washington, DC and the country roads near his home in Falls Village. His main hobby was being with his family, sharing music, travel, and well-written comedy; a quick, wry wit, he was a well-qualified critic. A devoted husband and father, Andy leaves and will forever be mourned by his wife Roxann, daughter Madeline and son Malcolm, his brother and sister-in-law, Laurence and Wendy Steinberg, of Philadelphia; his nephew, Benjamin Steinberg, of New York City, and will be sorely missed by friends, colleagues, and admirers worldwide. He was buried in Falls Village, CT; a memorial service will be held in Washington DC at a later date. Memorial contributions to The Eye Cancer Research Foundation, PO Box 832, Philadelphia, PA 19105"

2012-05-27T00:00:00Z,"Preparation for Oscar de la Renta's resort show began about a month ago, after the wrap-up of the bridal and fall collections. It all started with a book: Irving Penn's iconic ''Flowers,'' which has a large mauve and white tulip (among de la Renta's favorites) on its cover. For three weeks the house's design team went to the flower district and selected the best crop to be photographed and turned into textile prints. Backstage, in the corridor of the ODLR offices on the 25th floor of a 42nd Street building, are the fruits of these excursions: racks of pieces printed with colorful, overblown bearded iris and parrot tulips. They reveal a new direction for de la Renta's patterns - abstracts have been used in the past, but never so digitized. This season there will be a few surprises, but first the run of show needs to be solidified. In the office, three girls dressed in de la Renta looks sit in front of computers and work on last-minute changes to the list of what will be sent down the runway. A sheet is passed around. On it a de la Renta logo-ed sticky note stuck to the top reads ''Updated!'' in messy handwriting."

2012-05-27T00:00:00Z,"The architect Greg Lynn, who is known for the organic, biomorphic forms (or blobs, as he famously christened them) that he creates using sophisticated computer technology, designs everything from buildings to flatware and furniture. This year he added jewelry to his list of accomplishments. After working with Lynn in 2009 on an installation for Swarovski Crystal Palace at Design Miami, Nadja Swarovski, the company's creative director, invited him to design a jewelry collection for Atelier Swarovski. Now in its 10th season, Atelier Swarovski features jewelry and accessories by some of the world's leading designers in fields that include fashion and architecture. Lynn was intrigued by the idea of designing jewelry because, he says, ''most people don't get to see what I do or wear what I do.'' But Nadja's invitation didn't come without its challenges. Lynn started by sending her sketches, creating a family of forms based on the shapes and colors of the crystals themselves, and then began to make digital models of the pieces. ''I'm never surprised by anything in terms of scale,'' Lynn explains, ''but the scale of the jewelry was really whacked on the first round. It looks much bigger on the screen in the computer models I made. It took three rounds to just get the scale right.'' Lynn made all the prototypes in his studio, keeping practical issues like the weight of an earring in mind as he worked."

But in an era of smaller sluggers and increasingly-dominant pitchers, Major League Baseball may want to rebrand to focus on strikeouts. In recent days, piling up bunches of strikeouts has been all the rage. From Max Scherzer of the Detroit Tigers striking out 15 batters in seven innings to Dan Haren of the Los Angeles Angels striking out a career-high 14 in a shutout Thursday, it is looking like another Year of the Pitcher."
2012-05-27T00:00:00Z,"Four years after the 2008 collapse, the finance industry has regained its dominant position in American politics. Perhaps the development of deepest significance is an absence: the failure of a powerful anti-Wall Street faction to emerge in either the House or the Senate. This is in contrast to the response to previous financial crises, when Congress enacted tough legislation. Look at the current political environment this way: if Mitt Romney's campaign and the Romney-supporting ''super PAC'' Restore Our Future were a public company, the financial services industry would have a controlling interest."
2012-05-27T00:00:00Z,"Roland Barthes, a prolific and eclectic writer who was one of the most celebrated French intellectuals to have emerged since Jean-Paul Sartre, died Tuesday in Paris from injuries suffered in an auto accident this month. He was 64 years old. . . . Susan Sontag, a friend and admirer of Mr. Barthes, once described him as ''the most consistently intelligent, important and useful literary critic to have emerged anywhere'' in the last quarter-century. . . . Mourning the fact that he was ''condemned to assertion,'' Mr. Barthes accepted the title of literary critic with great reluctance, preferring, he said, to share his pleasures rather than pass judgments. Nonetheless, he could be quite lacerating when he joined the fray. He asserted, for example, that ''writing is the destruction of every voice, of every point of view,'' and that contrary to creating something original, literature ''is a multidimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and crash.'' Still, he could write about the many-faceted joys of reading -- ''The Pleasure of the Text'' in 1976 -- and about his own hedonistic inclinations in the autobiographical ''Roland Barthes'' (1977). His most popular book was ''A Lover's Discourse''; it sold more than 60,000 copies in France. Mr. Barthes lived alone, in a sparsely furnished apartment in Paris, and shared a country home with his mother near Bayonne. Excerpted from the March 27, 1980, obituary in The Times by Tony Schwartz, published two days after Barthes's death."

Who wouldn't want to be invited to watch Ms. Fleming rehearse, or to be welcomed into her home to talk music? The show is the first installment of a new season of the YoungArts series, which pairs aspiring singers, artists, playwrights and so on with someone at the top of the profession for mentoring. This isn't just a keep-up-the-good-work pep talk. In Monday's episode, Ms. Fleming has one young man sing with a cough drop balanced on his tongue, another while clenching a pencil between his teeth. The exercises are efforts to refine some aspect of the students' technique. Later the four get to watch Ms. Fleming rehearse at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which turns out to be a bit of a lesson for Ms. Fleming as well. ''I just thought, oh my God, I have to do everything right now,'' Ms. Fleming says afterward. ''I have to do the things that I asked them to do.''

2012-05-27T00:00:00Z,"Thirteen Roman Catholic dioceses and some Catholic-related groups scattered lawsuits across a dozen federal courts last week claiming that President Obama was violating their religious freedom by including contraceptives in basic health care coverage for female employees. It was a dramatic stunt, full of indignation but built on air. Mr. Obama's contraception-coverage mandate specifically exempts houses of worship. If he had ordered all other organizations affiliated with a religion to pay for their employees' contraception coverage, that policy could probably be justified under Supreme Court precedent, including a 1990 opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia."

They were gargantuan, more like lakes than pools. McCarren's capacity said it all: 6,800 swimmers in a 55,440-square-foot basin. Now, after being shut for 28 years, the pool and its historic bathhouse are set to reopen at the end of June.

The official, Fereydoon Abbasi, said there would be no suspension of enrichment by Iran, the central requirement of several United Nations Security Council resolutions.

2012-05-27T00:00:00Z,"CASSIDY--James D.,II. Around May 22, 2012 there was a knock on the front door. It was on this night that James D. Cassidy II's passing was announced to his wife Diane and their three children Megan, age 17, Brittany, age 14, and Jimmy, age 12. The detectives that stood before them had said ""We are sorry to have to tell you that your father has been in a terrible accident. He was on his way home from work when an off duty officer following behind him witnessed him swerve off the road."" From here the family had learned that when the man punched the window in to try and revive Jim he has already been unconscious. Born on April 10, 1964, at the age of 48 years and 42 days, his heart had stopped at 11:43pm. May 22nd will forever be considered the worst day in each of his family members' lives. Being a beloved son, husband, father, uncle, brother and friend, he would go to any extent to help the ones he loved. Jimmy was always the life of the party, and he was a great boss. He was an excellent father and devoted husband. He was thought of as Superman by his children. When it comes down to it, his family was the center of his world, nothing else could ever surpass the importance of his family. As the son of Jim and Mary Cassidy and son-in-law of Mike and Barbara Druckenbroad he was the eldest brother of seven children, Debbie, Karen, Donna, Michael, Christine and Brian. Jim was also the brother-in-law of Bonnie, Kathryn, Mike, Bruce, Lorraine and Keith. With so many siblings it was quite a sight to see his clan to get together with 29 nieces and nephews. With great heartache he had left children who had such a great love for him. Matt, Melissa, Jennifer, Stephanie, Letitia, Ashlee, Bryanne, Bruce, Alicia, Christen, Casey, Micaylee, Hailey, Michael, Keith, Andrew, Ryan, Kassandra, Shirley-Rebecca, Michael, Grace, Catherine, Marilyn, Joseph, Noah, Steven, Samantha, Anthony and Allison. His daughter recalls ""I always knew that Daddy knew how blessed he was, whether it was work opportunity or the accomplishments of his children. He had always been so proud. He was the rock of our clan Our strength, no decision was made without Daddy"" Prior to his passing the family had recently learned that James Cassidy I had developed a cancerous brain tumor. Earlier on the 22nd, Jimmy had gotten word that the Chemo wasn't working and that the tumor was growing. That night he had a conference call with his siblings in his office at the New York Times, questioning what they would do next. Little did they know that it was Jimmy they should have been most concerned about. Since learning of Jims passing it had become his father's dying wish to go to his son's funeral. So the hospital where he had been staying in Florida has released him and he will be transported to New York. ""Daddy won't take him yet. He has everything planned out now. He knows exactly when Pop Pop will meet him again."" His daughter said. He has always worked so hard. Jim was the proud General Foreman and Union Member of the Plate Room for The New York Times in College Point, NY. As stressful as his job was at times he loved it so much. He loved the men he worked with and made special bonds with Tony DeFelice, Deidre Deignan, Ernie Booth, Mike Connors and Nick D'Andrea. He loved bringing his family in for tours, he was always so proud. ""I remember he would always put our school pictures up in his office."" His daughter said ""He would always call home to check up on us, he loved us so much."" Jim's wake is going to be held at Robertaccios Funeral Home on Tuesday, May 29th from 2-4pm and 7-9pm. It is located on 85 Medford Avenue (Rt. 112) Patchouge, NY, 11712. The following day, Wednesday, May 30, there will be an 11 o'clock Mass held at St. Patrick's Church, located at 9N. Clinton Avenue, Bayshore, NY, 11706. The burial will follow immediately after at St. Patrick's Cemetery on Brentwood Rd., South of Sunrise Hwy. ""It is still impossible to believe that he is no longer with us. But in spirit he will always be looking out for each and every one of us. He will forever be our angel and our love for him is everlasting."""

By a 6-to-3 vote last week, the Supreme Court misguidedly ruled that the state can retry him on all charges, including those for murder. Justice Sonia Sotomayor properly noted in dissent, ''the threat to individual freedom from reprosecutions that favor states and unfairly rescue them from weak cases has not waned with time. Only this court's vigilance has.''"

She even dated a rock star. But it turns out that inside the striking, platinum blond Finnish beauty has long been a homebody, dying to, well, stay in. The ultimate expression of Laakkonen's true self is the appropriately named Tiina the Store, a home furnishings store that opens May 23 on Main Street in Amagansett, N.Y., not far from where she and her husband, Jon Rosen, recently built their dream house. The store is in fact an extension of that house, and the two will contain many design objects in common, including vintage Marimekko quilts, rugs by Dosa, wallpapers by the Finnish ceramicist Birger Kaipiainen and Iittala tableware. It will also feel very homey. ''I'm setting the store up very much like our house,'' Laakkonen says. There will of course also be a smattering of stylish things like jewelry by Ten Thousand Things, sandals from Ancient Greek Sandals, Save the C bags from Finland, S.N.S. sweaters from Denmark and children's clothing by Makié. You can take the girl out of fashion, but apparently you cannot take the fashion out of the girl. Tiina the Store is at 216 Main Street, Amagansett, N.Y.; (631) 267-6200; tiinathestore.com."

Don't miss them vying for the affections of Herman Cornejo's Solor, nor one of the subsequent performances, during the rest of the week, of Alexei Ratmansky's ''Bright Stream.'' That ballet is a rechoreographed version of a 1935 production by Fyodor Lopukhov, to music by Shostakovich, which despite its politically correct subject matter -- life on a collective farm -- was deemed unacceptable by Stalin and disappeared from view. Revived by Mr. Ratmansky, it gives us an idea of Soviet art, the idealized optimism of a lost Russia, and a very, very funny comedy that shows Ballet Theater as a unified ensemble of brilliant actor-dancers. You can't go wrong with any of the casts, but balletomanes will be keen to see the Danish-trained Royal Ballet principal Johan Kobborg trying out his pointe shoes and sylphide dress in his debut on Thursday as the Ballerina's Partner."

Bill W., as he was known in A.A. parlance, was a Wall Street analyst who battled the bottle during the Depression. In the 1930s he went from the proverbial rock bottom in an era of limited treatment options to proselytizing a fellowship-based model that would become the 12-step program. He was influenced by the evangelical Oxford Group, supported by his tireless wife and friends, and evidently aided by strong management skills and an entrepreneurial drive.

Now at another critical moment in American military history, the faculty here on the commanding bend in the Hudson River is deep in its own existential debate. Narrowly, the argument is whether the counterinsurgency strategy used in Iraq and Afghanistan -- the troop-heavy, time-intensive, expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads, schools and government -- is dead."

Combining historical sweep with cerebral humor, meticulous craftsmanship and an ability to mix and match tones and styles effortlessly -- jazzy, erotic, mythic, tragic -- he made 1980s hipster versions of big Hollywood studio productions.

2012-05-27T00:00:00Z,"JACOBSON--Audrey Platt, died on Saturday, May 19, 2012. She was born in New York City on March 9, 1928, the daughter of Joseph Platt and Anne Eisenberg Platt. A lifelong visual artist, she worked at her creations every day from the time she was 10 to the last day of her 84 year life. As a 14 year old she took the ferry from her home in New Jersey to Manhattan to attend classes at the Art Institute and the New School and spent a summer at the Yale School of Art. She continued her art studies and was graduated from Skidmore College in 1949 and from Parsons School of Design shortly thereafter. She married Dr. Jerry H. Jacobson in December, 1951 at her family home in New Jersey and they left for his tour of duty in the Air Force. She worked as an illustrator at the Air Base in Amarillo, Texas while they were stationed there. When discharged from service, the couple returned to New York, after the first trip of a lifetime of travel, by ship to Italy. She worked as artist and art director at advertising agencies in the city, and then opened an art gallery in Englewood, across the river from Manhattan in New Jersey. She was an indefatigable wife, homemaker and hostess to her many friends. Her integrity, sincerity and outgoing personality resulted in an uncanny ability to make friends wherever she went, among people of all stations. Her sons, John and Benjamin, were born in 1959 and 1961. She was an utterly devoted mother, wife and grandmother to Ben and Lissa's boys, Zachary and Dylan. In 1971 she and her family moved to Ogdensburg, where she continued her studies in Potsdam State and St. Lawrence University, ran a busy household, worked as a medical photographer and produced a voluminous body of prints and paintings. For the past few years she and her husband spent winters in Charleston, SC. Her lithographs, etchings and monoprints were shown at galleries and shows throughout the Unites States. Her work was marked by utter femininity, wit, spontaneity, humor and beauty. She never went a day without painting, printmaking or drawing. Her sketchbook and watercolors were always at hand. She studied the Italian language assiduously and traveled to that country and other lands often, making friends wherever she went. She was an avid gardener. Her health deteriorated in the recent past, but she never complained about it, but persevered in her daily output of watercolors and cheer. Her friends and family are devastated. There will be a memorial service in the future."

2012-05-27T00:00:00Z,"We had a taste of summer on our last visit to Corson's Brook Woods, equal parts blue sky, warm sun and green leaves. So why was it snowing just outside the forest? Drifts of white cottony fluff floated by, piling up among blades of a grassy lawn. I snatch one out of the air. Its silken hairs quickly separate to reveal a single tiny seed. I spot the source: a copse of cottonwood trees several hundred feet away. Walking across the street to the woods, I'm hit by the heady scent of a familiar flower, Japanese honeysuckle. The fragrance transports me back to childhood when my sister and I would pick them from a fence near our grammar school. We pulled the anthers out to slurp the nectar from the floral base. See a larger version of the forest from this week. Compare with the enlarged version of last week's image."

2012-05-27T00:00:00Z,"THRILLING as it was to hear a sitting president endorse marriage rights for gay and lesbian Americans, there is one man whose opinion on the subject matters more than President Obama's. Justice Anthony Kennedy is the likely deciding vote when this issue reaches the Supreme Court. More than anyone, he has the power to transform what is now a license bestowed by the more enlightened states into an all-American civil right. Kennedy's role as the court weather vane has given rise to a species of argument that Jeffrey Rosen, the George Washington University law professor, calls ''the Kennedy brief,'' in which ''lawyers on both sides fall over themselves to court Kennedy's favor by repeatedly citing the opinions of Justice Kennedy.'' I've been trying to envision the Kennedy brief in defense of gay marriage."

His tie was still knotted to the top as he launched into his stump speech, attacking his opponent's record and defending his own. ''I still believe in you,'' he said, ''and I hope you still believe in me.'' That is a proposition he is testing four years after the political winds converged behind his improbable journey to the White House. In marathon trips across the nation, he seeks to justify the faith supporters invested in him and earn it back. Sometimes he sounds like the outsider of 2008 running against an establishment that he now sits atop."

VON STROHEIM, on Mondays through July 30 at the Film Forum showcases his work, beginning with his troubled masterpiece ''Greed'' (1924), with a showing on Sunday as well as tomorrow, accompanied by Steve Sterner on piano. An adaptation of Frank Norris's ''McTeague,'' the film, not available on DVD, was chopped and chopped again (from about nine hours to about two and a half), but even truncated retains its power. (The Film Forum print runs just under two hours.) Next Monday, a double bill pairs von Stroheim's sole foray as a director into talking pictures, ''Hello, Sister!''

2012-05-27T00:00:00Z,"The poster for this Universal Pictures release may not look like it's promoting a slasher film. But Mr. Kerswell said it had several classic elements -- a terrified, beautiful young woman; a diabolical face; a foreboding tagline -- that make it an early example of the genre. (Whale is perhaps best remembered for 1931's ''Frankenstein'' and ''Bride of Frankenstein'' from 1935.) With a nod to Agatha Christie, the image shows a group facing misfortune, a scenario that fueled many films. The juxtaposition of beauty and horror is a slasher trope that Mr. Kerswell says is ''uncomfortable but undeniable.''

2012-05-27T00:00:00Z,"One thing that CNBC's profile of Millard (Mickey) Drexler, the chief executive of J. Crew, made clear on Thursday night is that his life is not the stuff of novels. True, he had what sounded like a lousy childhood, sleeping in the foyer of his family's Bronx apartment. And later, as a very rich man, he bought classy real estate, including Andy Warhol's former compound at Montauk. And true, he got the boot from Gap, in 2002, after a mostly innovative 19-year run that included the creation of Old Navy. (According to a Wall Street Journal profile, Mr. Drexler collected around $350 million when he cashed out his Gap stake.) Standing with the 67-year-old retail legend outside his old Bronx digs, the CNBC correspondent David Faber tried to do a Rosebud moment, and to a degree Mr. Drexler played along. (''I always wished I had a bedroom.'') But CNBC couldn't avoid the obvious in its hourlong program, despite a jaunt to Italy and its Moses-like title, ''J. Crew and the Man Who Dressed America.'' The fact is, Mr. Drexler is the stuff of retailing. He's a genius of merch."

There is no sewerage: a patchwork of plastic pipes repaired with duct tape winds underground to a swampy pond. Cars kick up a load of dust on the dirt road, which quickly turns to mud when it rains.

Brilliantly directed with an atypically tender touch by the Austrian director Michael Haneke, this story about an octogenarian husband and wife facing their mortality -- beautifully played by the French actors Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva -- had left audiences stunned with its artistry and depth of feeling. In the days leading up to the awards, the word buzzing through the festival was that ''Amour'' didn't stand a chance of winning a significant prize because the head of the competition jury, the Italian director Nanni Moretti, had profoundly disliked Mr. Haneke's violent 1997 shocker, ''Funny Games.'' Rounding out this year's jury were three other directors (Alexander Payne, Raoul Peck and Andrea Arnold); one fashion designer (Jean Paul Gaultier); and four performers (Hiam Abbass, Diane Kruger, Ewan McGregor and Emmanuelle Devos). That Mr. Haneke first won the Palme in 2009 for ''The White Ribbon'' was largely thought to be another factor working against him."

And while it is closed for restoration, some of its choicest items are on the road. The itinerary brings 15 pictures to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in ''BELLINI, TITIAN AND LOTTO: NORTH ITALIAN PAINTINGS FROM THE ACCADEMIA CARRARA, BERGAMO.'' There are, of course, things by the superstars of the title. Giovanni Bellini's ''Pietà with the Virgin and Saint John,'' dated between 1455 and 1460, is a mournful complement to his later ''Madonna and Child,'' which is in the Met's collection. The single Titian is the very early ''Orpheus and Eurydice,'' thought to have been done between 1508 and 1512. And from Lorenzo Lotto we have a charming portrait of Lucina Brembati, who wears a large jeweled toothpick on a gold chain around her neck. Less familiar sights are three smallish narrative paintings from a Lotto altarpiece that has not traveled. And then there are artists you probably won't know at all, like Giovanni Cariani, Andrea Previtali, Moretto da Brescia and Vincenzo Foppa. But really, they're just old friends that you have yet to meet. Through Sept. 3; Metropolitan Museum of Art; (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org."

They number five, one for each operation in the six years Baker spent away from professional tennis. Each scar tells a story: of the hips that refused to heal, of the sports hernia, of the hundreds of hours spent not on tennis courts but inside doctors' offices. One scar, which runs along Baker's right elbow, resulted from his longest and most unusual operation, one performed overwhelmingly on baseball players, one even named after a pitcher, Tommy John."

The image of sharp glass dripping with blood suggests the villain is not your grandmother's monster.

The performance had something of a guest star, as well. Ludovic Morlot, the recently appointed music director of the Seattle Symphony, conducted the ensemble in two chamber orchestra works. Mr. Aperghis, who was born in Athens in 1945 and has lived in France since he was 17, was a student of another Greek expatriate in France, Iannis Xenakis. You can hear Xenakis's influence in Mr. Aperghis's often dense, biting harmonic language, but Mr. Aperghis has moved into a world of his own, with abstract theater pieces and chamber works pulling him in different directions."

The book, ''Conversations with Chen Xitong,'' which goes on sale in Hong Kong on Friday, is by Yao Jianfu, a Chinese scholar, who writes that he spoke with Mr. Chen eight times since early last year. Mr. Chen told Mr. Yao that ''several hundred people died that day.'' He also said that he had wanted a peaceful resolution and still did not know who played which roles in organizing the military assault. Mr. Chen was removed as mayor in 1995, convicted of corruption in 1998 and imprisoned. He was released on medical parole in 2004."

While most of his fellow riders met with representatives from Oakley, Fields surveyed the track, a replica of the one riders will race on at the London Olympics, and noted his disdain for goggles. Asked why he elected not to wear them, what with the dirt and the rocks and the competitors on small bikes that can reach 40 miles per hour, Fields laughed. ''You don't get hit if you're in front,'' he said."

So it was on Sunday afternoon, when the orchestra played its final concert of the season, the last to be conducted by Ryan McAdams, who has ended his five-year tenure as music director. The main work was Mahler's Symphony No. 5 in C sharp minor, a complex, craggy and demanding score lasting some 75 minutes. And Mr. McAdams drew an energetic and involving performance from the inspired players, who range in age from 12 to 22. Every program this ensemble gives at Carnegie Hall includes the premiere of a work written by a young composer. This one had ''On the Hunt,'' a restless, fitful 15-minute piece for horn quartet and orchestra by Elizabeth A. Kelly."

This three-day conference, which will feature talks on subjects ranging from hats and monarchs to the role of the Crown in a constitutional system, commemorates the 60th anniversary of the Queen's ascension to the throne as well as the recently completed renovation of the palace. But it can also be seen as an unofficial celebration of another refurbishment: that of the study of modern monarchy itself."

It was also supposed to help limit noisy garbage trucks going long distances through the city to reach marine barges, railways or out-of-state trash facilities. Nobody wanted these new garbage transfer stations in their neighborhood, even with promises of new high-tech, low-smell facilities. There are already stations in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island, most of them in lower-income communities. Only one area of the city -- the Upper East Side of Manhattan -- has refused to accept a trash facility. The city should not give in to local resistance."

Instead of the relentless misogyny and scorched-earth worldview of his better-known ''Miss Julie'' and ''Dance of Death,'' we get aphorisms and flirtations.

But if there has been something Nixonian about him, a man fallen from grace at home yet still widely celebrated abroad, Mr. Blair marked a comeback of a kind on Monday.

Poor marks could eventually mean fines or other penalties for members that do not make adequate efforts to balance their books. The long-term goal is to prevent the kind of uncontrolled spending that crippled Greece from happening again. But with the euro zone in financial flames, the newly strengthened budget review process is also a reminder of how slowly things move in official E.U. channels. Between the adoption of the new budget enforcement rules last autumn and this incremental step, governments in Greece, Italy and France have fallen or been voted out of office.

In ballet and modern dance, choreography is the shaping factor, the ingredient that brings music, subject matter and performance together into a whole; in a musical, that's seldom so. But the great choreographers are great directors too: inventors of their own genres of theater. Paradoxically, some of the most eminent choreographers -- from George Balanchine to Matthew Bourne -- have also been happy to work with directors in musicals, and have learned new skills by doing so. Jerome Robbins is the most famous of those who worked on Broadway as a director-choreographer. There is no single method for choreography to succeed in a musical: It may be a source of isolated highlights or a unifying thread."

Fewer will make it to the following day's semifinals, where one mistake means elimination. I'd wager that many of them will be silently praying, Not on the first word.

But it sometimes fails another test of the capitalist world. The company is valued by the Russian stock market at even less than its cash and easily sold assets. That astonishing fact suggests that investors see no real value in the business."

The owners of the Canal Room, a fixture in New York City's music scene, have announced plans to open a sister club, called Canal Room Southampton, on June 15. The new club will be on Elm Street in the quiet, seaside resort on Long Island and will be able to handle up to 800 people a night, twice the size of the club in Manhattan, the owners, Marcus Linial and Sam Lott, said on Thursday. In a statement, the nightclub impresarios said they think there is a market in the Hamptons for ''a spacious location where vacationers and residents can let their hair down and explore their inner rock star.'' Since it opened a decade ago, the Canal Room has been a favored spot for high-profile music industry events and record-release parties. As a result, it's a small room where big stars sometimes appear; Kanye West, Rihanna, John Mayer and more recently Hot Chelle Rae, have performed there."

2012-05-28T00:00:00Z,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- International efforts to pressure Syria intensified on Monday, as the United Nations special envoy Kofi Annan began negotiations in the capital, Damascus, and the chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff warned that continued atrocities could make military intervention more likely. Mr. Annan traveled to Syria seeking to salvage his peace plan, which appeared more precarious than ever after the massacre of at least 108 villagers in the Houla area of central Syria. He urged the government to hold to its commitment in March to honor the six-point plan, which included not only a cease-fire, but also political dialogue with the opposition and freedom for Syrians to demonstrate."

2012-05-28T00:00:00Z,"WEST POINT, N.Y. -- For two centuries, the United States Military Academy has produced generals for America's wars, among them Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, George S. Patton and David H. Petraeus. It is where President George W. Bush delivered what became known as his pre-emption speech, which sought to justify the invasion of Iraq, and where President Obama told the nation he was sending an additional 30,000 American troops to Afghanistan. Now at another critical moment in American military history, the faculty here on the commanding bend in the Hudson River is deep in its own existential debate. Narrowly, the argument is whether the counterinsurgency strategy used in Iraq and Afghanistan -- the troop-heavy, time-intensive, expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads, schools and government -- is dead."

The scholar, Jerome A. Cohen, a law professor at New York University, wrote in an e-mail that the brother, Chen Guangfu, was back at home as of Saturday night and ''unguarded but under great pressure.''

Consider the risk in joining a magazine that offers readers design tips like how to avoid tripping over a lamp's electric cord with a magazine that recently ran a 5,600-word cover article on the heart-wrenching decline of an aging parent. But this October, the modern design guide Dwell will introduce an annual publication with New York magazine tied to a weeklong design festival. It is the first time Dwell has worked with another publication. New York magazine said it had not done anything like this since 1972, when it ran Ms. magazine as an insert."

Ms. Workman had been a volunteer at ground zero for about two years after the Sept. 11 attacks.

''Men in Black 3'' took in an estimated $55 million over four days, failing to land in the top 20 on the all-time list. Some hits, like ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,'' take in as much as 45 percent of their eventual total on the first holiday weekend.

''The Turn of the Screw,'' Britten's 1954 adaptation of the Henry James novella concerning restless ghosts and corrupted innocents, is smaller, subtler and less widely exposed. But in dramatic efficacy it is at least the equal of its grander cousins, and it shows a singular musical ingenuity. It is also the rare work that grows more intensely disquieting the deeper you delve, past clear implications of child abuse, probably sexual, to allusions and suggestions coded so deeply as to be practically invisible to an audience."

The statement revived criticism leveled at Mr. McFaul when he arrived, accusations that he had come to Russia to foment revolution. The statement said Mr. McFaul had given a distorted picture of Russian foreign policy; it also said he had ''cast a shadow on the highly professional activities of the channel 'Russia Today' in the United States,'' among other complaints. ''The aim of an ambassador, as we understand it, is to promote sustained development of bilateral relations with the host country based on thorough knowledge of the facts, and not irritated repetition of fairy tales in the media,'' the statement said."

Stock markets here and around the world inched higher Monday after the news, but experts here cautioned against reading too much into the results. They warned that Greek voters were still changing their minds on an almost daily basis and that the leftist party, Syriza, which has promised a wholescale renegotiation of the terms of the austerity plan, could also take the election scheduled for June 17."

2012-05-28T00:00:00Z,"As Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin faces a well deserved recall vote next month after stripping public unions of their bargaining rights, voters are discovering the generosity of Diane Hendricks. Ms. Hendricks, the billionaire chairwoman of the nation's largest roofing and siding wholesaler, wrote a check for $500,000 last month to help defend Governor Walker, a Republican, against his Democratic challenger, Tom Barrett, the mayor of Milwaukee. The eye-popping donation was made possible by a quirk in the state law for recall campaigns. And Ms. Hendricks has never been shy about what she wants. A newly released piece of documentary video shows her running into Governor Walker two weeks after he took office in 2011. In what was presumed to have been a private discussion, Ms. Hendricks asked, ''Any chance we'll ever get to be a completely red state and work on these unions and become a right to work'' state?"

The opera, ''The Firework Maker's Daughter,'' with music by David Bruce and a libretto by Glyn Maxwell, uses actors and puppets to render the story of a girl who seeks to design and create fireworks despite the wishes of her father.

Playwrights Horizons is mounting a completely new production of the play, which initially had been announced for Broadway following its premiere at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago in 2010."
2012-05-29T00:00:00Z,"To watch successive performances of the three-act ballet ''La Bayadère,'' no matter what the company or in whose production, involves its trials. The choreography, by Marius Petipa and a number of successors, ranges from the sublime to the ridiculous; the music, by Ludwig Minkus, is often trivial; the narrative is melodramatic and the storytelling repeatedly hammy. It's a credit to American Ballet Theater, which I watched in five ''Bayadères'' between last Wednesday and Monday at the Metropolitan Opera House, that each rendition brought, as well as the visual loveliness of the celebrated Shades scene, individual rewards. Differently arresting each time was the entrance of the hero, Solor. Hardly has the ballet begun when he arrives, soon followed by the carcass of a tiger. In simple mime gestures, he declares, ''I killed that with my spear!''"

But Italian officials have been eager to upgrade their Reapers, a larger, more lethal version of Predator drones, since an Italian soldier died in a firefight while the unarmed aircraft hovered overhead helplessly, a senior Congressional aide said."

Greece, the country most at risk of falling out of the euro, typified the contradiction. There, people were most likely to say that their country had been weakened by European economic integration. Yet support for the euro was highest, the poll found, perhaps showing Greek preferences as they head into new parliamentary elections on June 17 that could determine their future in the currency union."

This is close to the time when the first anatomically modern humans were spreading into Central Europe, presumably along the Danube River valley."

The case involves the arrests this month of four formerly high-ranking army officers, including a former under secretary of defense, who are suspected of passing information to the Beltrán Leyva drug gang for money. For some Americans, the arrests confirm a longstanding wariness of the army, and have reawakened concerns about how closely it may be linked to the gang, one of the top traffickers of cocaine to the United States and a particular focus of American drug agents."

Mr. Dewhurst, one of the longest-serving lieutenant governors in state history, was the front-runner in a field of nine primary candidates seeking to replace Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican who is retiring after serving three terms. Mr. Dewhurst, a rancher and businessman who pumped more than $9 million of his fortune into his campaign and who was backed by Gov. Rick Perry, fell a few points short of exceeding 50 percent of the vote and faces a July 31 runoff with Mr. Cruz, who placed second, according to The Associated Press.

But now, with expanded production facilities gearing up, the company will soon produce enough pops to sell to grocery stores. So yes, we'll have strawberry-rhubarb in the snow. At Phin & Phebes, they believe in ice cream all year round. The Brooklyn company, which started about six months ago, sells only pints, which are available in dozens of stores. The partners, Crista Freeman (Phin) and Jess Eddy (Phebe), use dairy products from family farms upstate for their brief roster of five (uncommon) flavors: ginger cookie snap, coconut-Key lime, Vietnamese iced coffee, vanilla cinnamon and banana whama, a real winner that's like a frozen banana pudding."
2012-05-29T00:00:00Z,"''5 Broken Cameras'' provides a grim reminder -- just in case you needed one -- of the bitter intractability of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A chronicle of protest and endurance, punctuated by violence and tiny glimmers of hope, this documentary is unlikely to persuade anyone with a hardened view of the issue to think again. For anyone who retains an interest in the human contours of the situation, however, the movie is necessary, if difficult, viewing. For while it is hardly neutral -- presenting an extended, highly personal view of life in a West Bank village adjacent to Israel's controversial security fence -- ''5 Broken Cameras'' is much more than yet another polemical bulletin from an embattled region. It may seem perverse to praise an eyewitness account of political trauma for its formal accomplishments, but for a project like this to claim the attention of an audience it has to justify itself as cinema. There is no shortage of information and opinion about the Middle East, and this film, made collaboratively by Emad Burnat and Guy Davidi, is partly a piece of advocacy journalism. But it is also a visual essay in autobiography and, as such, a modest, rigorous and moving work of art."

The 1993 N.H.L. playoffs were a period of wondrous discovery for many Angelenos, never mind that the Kings had been in Los Angeles for 26 years and Wayne Gretzky had been a King for five. Trekking to the Forum to watch the Kings' first run to the Stanley Cup finals was akin to wandering into Whisky A Go Go on Sunset Boulevard when The Doors were the house band.

It warned that the test may push them to undergo unnecessary invasive tests and treatments apt to harm more people than help. This month, the panel, after further review of the scientific evidence, issued the same recommendation in final form. Men who undergo the prostate-specific antigen, or P.S.A., test do so in the common belief that it is always good to catch and eliminate a cancer early before it has a chance to spread. They seldom focus on potential harms from follow-up procedures. In this case, the United States Preventive Services Task Force concluded that the benefit of the test in preventing cancer deaths was minimal and was more than offset by the adverse effects of surgery or radiation to remove slow-growing tumors that would never have killed the patient."

His legacy is evidenced by the strength and bond of his family, his record of charitable endeavors, and his involvement in industry organizations for the betterment of us all. We are, in part, what we are today due to the examples that he set for us. His imprint on our industry and on all of us individually will last forever. We extend our condolences to his wife Alice, daughter and son-in-law Rita and Sheldon Kwiat, daughter Shelley, and to the entire Roisen and Kwiat families. Ronald J. Friedman President, DMIA"

Edith was the only child of the late Kathleen Spence Wooster of Harrison, New York and William A. Read Jr. of Palm Beach, Florida. She was an avid shooter, loved to sail, including horseback ridding and fishing. During her lifetime, she achieved the Number One Ladies Shot in the Eastern Zone, High Ladies Gun at the Campfire Club of America in Chappaqua, New York, and placed second two years running at the Annual Invitational Lake Placid Regatta.

Upon graduating, she worked for IBM , sold real estate and raised a family. She managed her time between her home in Purchase, New York, visiting her father in Palm Beach, Florida and Cody, Wyoming, and her family Camp in Tupper Lake, New York which she loved best of all. Edith was a devoted mother, grandmother and daughter. She is survived by her two sons, Thomas A. Wey Jr. of Rye, New York and David Read Wey of Wayland, Massachusetts, two daughters-in-law, Lisa Berggren Wey and Claudia Guadagnini Wey, and their three grandchildren, Gunnar Read Wey (six years old), Nicholas Read Wey (nine years old) and Gianluca Read Wey (six years old).

A lower court, acting at the request of the State Department, previously blocked the hostages' effort to win compensation from Iran, holding that the agreement under which they were released barred such claims. The former hostages had sued under a 1996 law that they argued allowed them to seek damages, and in August 2001 they won a judgment of liability, because Iran did not appear in court to defend itself.

2012-05-29T00:00:00Z,"WHEN Sasha Petraske opened his bar Milk & Honey on a desolate Lower East Side block in 2000, the coming cocktail revival was barely a pie-eyed glimmer in the public's eye. Almost instantaneously, the tiny watering hole near Delancey Street became the model for neo-speakeasy cool, attracting an enduring following. It is still regarded as near holy ground by cocktail mavens. But it also inspired detractors, who found the saloon's lack of a sign or a menu precious, and its notorious reservation-only policy (which has now bedeviled would-be in-crowders for a decade) haughty."

The city's dismal finances have led to a state-appointed fiscal overseer, and its school system is the first in Massachusetts to be placed in receivership. The former superintendent, Wilfredo Laboy, was recently convicted of embezzlement. According to The Boston Globe, Mayor William Lantigua is the subject of corruption investigations by local and federal authorities, as well as a campaign finance investigation by the state attorney general."

2012-05-29T00:00:00Z,"When word circulates that a runner has died of a heart attack, as the inexhaustible ultramarathoner Micah True did last month during a solo wilderness trail run, many people begin to wonder about the healthiness of prolonged strenuous activity. Could marathon training and racing perhaps have damaged the heart muscle of the 58-year-old Mr. True, a lead character in the book ''Born to Run''? And, conversely, shouldn't marathon training have made him -- and, by extension, all runners -- immune to heart disease? Those questions, familiar to any scientist or physician who works with endurance athletes, inspired several recently published studies of the relative risks of marathon running. The science suggests that, over all, distance running and racing are extremely unlikely to kill you -- except when, in rare instances, they do."

But friends and critics alike say Syria could be Mr. Annan's undoing. Invited back in February by his successor as secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to serve as the special envoy to Syria for both the United Nations and the Arab League, Mr. Annan, 74, appeared to put aside what to many others seemed obvious: the conflict in Syria was intractable, enormously complicated and unsolvable by diplomacy alone."

Ms. Levine graduated magna cum laude from Brandeis University, M.A. University of Chicago, and J.D. NYU School of Law. She was the author of fiction and non-fiction for children, young readers and adults that focused on important social issues and historical periods.

Her most recent novel, ""In Trouble,"" the story of two pregnant girls in the l950's, reflects her profound belief that the right to choose abortion is an individual choice, and that whatever one's ultimate decision, it must be viewed with compassion and respect. Prior to her writing career, Ellen clerked for Chief Judge Joseph Lord, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and practiced law for the Prisoners Rights Project, NY Legal Aid Society. ""I grew up,"" she wrote, ""knowing there were battles to be fought and worlds to change.""

In Damascus, the United Nations envoy said the uprising had reached ''a tipping point'' after a massacre of more than 100 villagers, nearly half of them children. In his remarks, Kofi Annan, the envoy for the United Nations and the Arab League, was dismissive of the Syrian government refrain that outsiders were responsible for the bloodshed. After meeting with Mr. Assad on Tuesday, he called on the Syrian president to take ''bold steps'' to end the fighting and salvage a peace plan that has been increasingly criticized for failing to end the violence."

2012-05-29T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON -- One of the few bills moving through Congress with bipartisan support this spring would speed government approval of lower-cost generic copies of brand-name drugs. But one company, with help from an influential former congressman, is lobbying to protect its most lucrative brand-name product against generic competition and appears to have had some success in the House, potentially altering the bill to make it more favorable for the company. The dispute highlights a central issue in health care, as makers of brand-name drugs -- many of which have struggled in recent years to develop successful new drugs -- fight to limit generic competition on their existing products for as long as possible. Brand-name companies argue that future drug development will suffer if they cannot profit from their investments, while generic companies argue that they can hold down medical costs."

Last week, Senator Mike Enzi, a Republican of Wyoming, and Senator Tim Johnson, a Democrat of South Dakota, introduced a bill to name the North American bison as the national mammal. It is hard to think of a better or more deserving creature for that distinction. The bison is already a part of America's official iconography. It appears on the obverse of the buffalo nickel, a much-loved coin minted from 1913 to 1938. And, in hindsight, we can see the tragic parallel between the eagle and the bison. The founding fathers could not have known that the eagle would nearly become extinct, partly because of the spread of DDT. Nor could anyone who saw the immense North American herds of bison imagine that they would nearly be hunted out by the 1880s, which was a disaster for the species, for the ecosystem that bison shaped and for American Indians, who depended on bison. At one time, they numbered fewer than 1,000 animals."

When the New Main opened in 1996, its boosters touted it as a ''high-tech information retrieval center.'' So did its critics. It had 300 computer workstations, additional electrical outlets for patrons who brought their own laptops, a sleek and airy layout with sightlines that made it the envy of every high-security prison warden in the land, and apparently, hidden in some low-tech, off-message nook, a Typewriter Room."

In Alexei Ratmansky's ''Bright Stream,'' Ballet Theater's latest offering, a husband strays, but the two toe-shoed objects of his affection stick together in solidarity. It's one of the many ways in which ''Bright Stream'' is a comedy, set in the unlikely locale of a Soviet collective farm. The score, by Dmitri Shostakovich, and the libretto date from 1935. In 2003 Mr. Ratmansky refurbished both with his own choreography for the Bolshoi, where he became artistic director in 2004.

In the first half of 2007, according to Dealogic, the industry accounted for more than 18 percent of announced takeover volume in the world. It all came crashing down, and last year private equity accounted for a bit less than 7 percent of total global takeover volume, according to Dealogic."

He is precious to his parents, loves chasing a soccer ball in the backyard and has an abiding passion for ''cooking,'' which recently meant standing in the kitchen, mixing a concoction of salt, pepper and whipped cream in a bowl, then stirring continually. Jayce also loves books. And so at least once or twice a day, he will toddle over to his mother or father with a few of his favorites. Dr. Seuss is a popular choice. So, too, is anything from the ''I Spy'' series."

A dress had a front and a back, and the two pieces were joined at the sides. The simplicity was such that a clever child, using a cookie cutter, tracing paper and the photocopying services of Kinko's, could produce the basic pattern.

But this time around, the publisher has added something new: its first Infinite Comic, a digital-only prelude to ''Avengers vs. X-Men'' that was released with issue No. 1 of the print series last month. It represents another step by the comic book industry toward embracing the digital format, and one that holds the potential to push traditional comic book storytelling to a new level. ''This is the first time we've created a comic book story for the hand-held device,'' said Axel Alonso, Marvel's editor in chief. ''It keeps all the familiar conventions of the comic book -- panels, borders, captions and balloons. But it's not animation -- there's no voice-over, there's no score -- and, most importantly, the reader still controls the experience.''"

But with the next election barely five months away and Mitt Romney gearing up for a tough battle with President Obama, Mr. Kissinger, a former Republican secretary of state, remains on the sidelines. The reason, according to several Republicans familiar with the matter: concerns about Mr. Romney's aggressive statements on trade policy toward China, a keen issue for Mr. Kissinger, who helped reopen relations with China and who later, as a consultant, has had clients with significant interests there."

Written by Kate Angelo and directed by Alan Poul, the movie is essentially a vehicle for displaying ''how good Ms. Lopez looks after a few years off from the movies, during which she had twins and then -- to judge from the many shots of her taut stomach, firm thighs and even a peek-a-boo look at her derrière -- got back into shape,'' Ms. Dargis wrote. ''It's hard not to regret that this star hasn't been given a more luxurious setting for her big-screen return, something that made the most of her charm and talents and gave her more to do than make you smile (which you might do) and tear up (that too) as you marvel at the irresistible appeal of stories about people falling in love and, of course, at that sensational rear.''"

As the blog Fashionista put it, ''We've always thought of Brooks as more of a Bergdorf girl.'' Ms. Brooks's duties included overseeing private labels and creating trend reports, informed in part by the street style of ''it'' girls, many of whom were part of her impressive network. ''We didn't need more retail help,'' Mark Lee, the store's chief executive, said of the hire at the time.

On Wednesday the Hard Case Crime imprint of Titan Books plans to announce that it will publish ''Joyland,'' a new work of fiction by Mr. King, whose protagonist is a college student working at a North Carolina theme park in the summer of 1973. While employed there the character ''confronts the legacy of a vicious murder, the fate of a dying child, and the ways both will change his life forever,'' the publisher said in a news release. Charles Ardai, the Hard Case Crime editor, said in a statement that ''Joyland'' is ''a whodunit, it's a carny novel, it's a story about growing up and growing old, and about those who don't get to do either because death comes for them before their time.'' Hard Case Crime, which published Mr. King's 2005 mystery novel ''The Colorado Kid,'' said it would release ''Joyland'' in June 2013. Mr. King said in a statement that, in addition to his affection for the subject matter of the book, ''I also loved the paperbacks I grew up with as a kid, and for that reason, we're going to hold off on e-publishing this one for the time being.''

With 2.5 million trees in its care, the city has a daunting task: both to preserve the green canopy that cools parks and streets, and to protect the public that passes under it. For street trees, the city generally relies on outside contractors, while for trees in parks, it dispatches in-house forestry crews. In recent years, budgets for both have shrunk."
2012-05-30T00:00:00Z,"It has been clear for years that the Obama administration believes the shadow war on terrorism gives it the power to choose targets for assassination, including Americans, without any oversight. On Tuesday, The New York Times revealed who was actually making the final decision on the biggest killings and drone strikes: President Obama himself. And that is very troubling. Mr. Obama has demonstrated that he can be thoughtful and farsighted, but, like all occupants of the Oval Office, he is a politician, subject to the pressures of re-election. No one in that position should be able to unilaterally order the killing of American citizens or foreigners located far from a battlefield -- depriving Americans of their due-process rights -- without the consent of someone outside his political inner circle."

Most people have abandoned film cameras for digital models or, more recently, smartphones outfitted with lens accessories and apps like Instagram that make photo-sharing extremely simple."
2012-05-30T00:00:00Z,"Millions of Americans with damaged credit records are at risk of being unfairly denied job opportunities by companies that use credit histories to screen applicants. Faced with growing public complaints, seven states have rightly limited the use of credit histories by potential employers. Federal, state and local lawmakers who are considering similar legislation are on the right track. Job-related credit checks have grown increasingly popular, with an estimated 60 percent of employers using them, up from about 20 percent in the mid-1990s. Yet several studies have shown -- and some in the credit-checking industry readily admit -- that a poor rating does not automatically make a person a poor job prospect or more likely to commit fraud. Very often, damaged credit is the result of a layoff during the recession, divorce or a catastrophic illness."

In a mystery that has captivated the tight-knit community of men's wear editors and buyers, who saw Mr. Spurr as a rising star, he apparently quit over an unnamed disagreement with Judd Nydes, his business partner and a founder of the label, and has remained quiet in the two months since. And in a curious twist to a now familiar story of designer-management conflicts, Mr. Nydes says that the Simon Spurr label will continue without the designer's involvement, despite the obvious obstacles to doing so. For now, retailers have been told not to expect deliveries of Mr. Spurr's fall collection. Most of the company's stock from previous seasons has been sold off and most of the remaining employees, roughly nine in total, have been let go. Meanwhile, Mr. Spurr now says he might be open to returning to the company, but only with a new strategic partner."

Researchers at Kaspersky Lab, which first reported the virus Monday, believe Flame was written by a different group of programmers from those who had created other malware directed at computers in the Middle East, particularly those in Iran. But Flame appears to be part of the state-sponsored campaign that spied on and eventually set back Iran's nuclear program in 2010, when a digital attack destroyed roughly a fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges."

2012-05-30T00:00:00Z,"In the 1960s, nearly every aspiring guitarist spent a lot of time sitting beside a record player, setting the needle on the vinyl, listening to a few bars and then trying to pick out the notes on the guitar. (Now, of course, there are apps to make this easier.) You would do this over and over and over again. With a little patience, a song would give up its secrets. And the more songs that gave up their secrets, the easier the learning became. For a lot of us young guitarists, that process came to a halt when we first heard Doc Watson, who died on Tuesday at 89. Hearing him that first time was like standing by the railroad tracks when Casey Jones went past on his last night ride. It wasn't just Doc Watson's speed that stunned a young guitarist. It wasn't even his accuracy. It was the energy behind his flat pick. Listening to him, you could almost imagine his right arm moving like the wheel pistons on a steam locomotive. You could hear the stiffness in the strings, the subtle hammering of his pick, the cyclone of notes gathering round your head.

The ruling came in response to a claim by the companion of a Mexican man who drowned in a river on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington last year after a Border Patrol officer, summoned by a Forest Service officer, chased the man into the woods.

The sentence was immediately condemned by Google and human rights groups. The manager of the site, Prachatai, a popular forum for discussions about politics and culture, was convicted of lèse-majesté, as royal insults are known, under Thailand's Computer Crimes Act. Courts in Thailand have jailed people convicted of lèse-majesté with increasing frequency in recent years, but the verdict on Wednesday was unusual in that the defendant, Chiranuch Premchaiporn, was not the author of the offending comments; she was just the Web master of the site that hosted them."
2012-05-30T00:00:00Z,"Ah, the stresses of the memorabilia sellers on ''Final Offer,'' Discovery's new entry in what might be called How Much Can I Get for My Stuff Television. Four buyers, but no clue as to which one is willing to pay the most. ''If only I could drill into their heads and see what they're thinking,'' these hopefuls must be musing. Actually, in the premiere on Thursday night, one seller, Doug Arbittier, could do just that. He has brought a 250-year-old neurosurgery kit to sell: a crude, sinister-looking collection of tools that would not be out of place in a ''Saw'' movie."

Brown until Democrats had settled on a candidate, endorsed the embattled Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday. The unexpected move, announced at a contentious news conference at Warren headquarters here, came just days before the state Democratic Party is to hold its convention. Delegates are expected to back Ms. Warren, but they may also give enough support to another candidate, Marisa DeFranco, to allow her a spot on the September primary ballot to challenge Ms. Warren."

In essence, it's an iPhone without the cellphone bill. It does almost everything the iPhone does -- runs 600,000 apps, plays movies and music, displays e-books, takes pictures and videos, checks e-mail and Web sites -- but without requiring you to sign your soul over to Verizon or AT&T. When you factor in the monthly fees, the two-year cost of an iPhone is at least $1,880. The iPod Touch? $200."

2012-05-30T00:00:00Z,"Thelonious Monk's music stands for many things -- intuitive rigor, rugged refinement, a system of intervallic order -- but what often goes underused by his interpreters is its baseline condition of pleasure. That particular lapse is not a problem for the pianist Eric Reed. During his sold-out first set at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola on Tuesday night, he played six Monk compositions with thoughtful attunement to their essence. He also made them seem about as cheery and buoyant as a bunch of balloons held by the string. Half the tunes came from ''The Baddest Monk,'' Mr. Reed's immensely satisfying new album on Savant; the other half were from ''The Dancing Monk,'' released on the same label last year. So this was a business visit, as Mr. Reed kept reminding the audience, plugging the albums with a congenial grin."
2012-05-30T00:00:00Z,"ZENITH'S Flash-Matic, the original wireless TV remote invented by Eugene Polley, looked like an intergalactic weapon, and no wonder. It was born at the same time as the ''Flash Gordon'' TV series, which ran from 1954 to 1955. Flash-Matic took its cues from more down-to-earth influences as well. Rama Chorpash, director of product design at Parsons, the New School for Design, said that in the '50s there was ''a whole typology'' of devices that looked like guns. The 1954 radar speed gun is another example. ''It's all about control,'' Mr. Chorpash said."

2012-05-31T00:00:00Z,"Doc Watson, who died on Tuesday at the age of 89, was the first truly great guitar player I ever saw up close. For me growing up in Santa Monica, Calif., in the 1950s meant that great musicians were only manifested on records and radio, making it hard to catch a glimpse of the person behind the layers of sound and presentation. You knew people like Hank Snow and Merle Travis were great, but you couldn't be sure how much the Nudie suits and custom boots had contributed to the sound you heard on KXLA radio. Then Doc and the banjo player Clarence Ashley and some of the boys drove out to Los Angeles for the first U.C.L.A. Folk Festival in 1963. On the lawn by Royce Hall, the gothic classical music site, they gathered around and sang ''Daniel Prayed,'' an intricate call-and-response-style gospel tune. People were here and there, wandering around aimlessly, as they do at these events. It was casual and unannounced. We hadn't entered into the hyperorganized way of music appreciation just yet.

Usually the only thing left would be the tax write-offs. But even as the biggest flop of the season, ''Leap of Faith'' had an unusual asterisk - its single Tony Award nomination, a major one, for best musical. And so the producers had a decision to make: Whether to leave ''Leap of Faith'' dead and buried, or capitalize on the nomination and pay to stage a musical number on the Tony Awards telecast on CBS on June 10? The producers opted to go for it, and have raised roughly $150,000 to secure a spot for the number at the Tonys ceremony, according to two Broadway industry executives familiar with the plans; they divulged the information on condition of anonymity to preserve their relationships with the ''Leap'' producers, who declined to comment. But a spokeswoman for the producers said that they had raised enough money to stage the number, though she declined to confirm the amount."

2012-06-01T00:00:00Z,"The first courtroom arguments will take place in Manhattan on Friday in the legal battle between the Broadway producers of ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark'' and their former director, Julie Taymor, with three procedural motions before the judge in the case, according to people on both sides. Private settlement talks broke off in late winter, and both camps are now focused on assembling evidence and arguments for a full-blown trial next year when boldface reputations and millions of dollars would be at stake. The ''Spider-Man'' producers - with the backing of Ms. Taymor's onetime allies, Bono and the Edge of U2 - fired her in March 2011 after three months of preview performances of the $75 million show; the firing came after the producers and the two musicians clashed with Ms. Taymor over script and staging changes meant to improve the show. The musical was subsequently overhauled and then opened in June, to negative reviews; it has since gone on to be a box-office hit, grossing about $1.5 million a week."

2012-06-01T00:00:00Z,"The electric light was a failure. Invented by the British chemist Humphry Davy in the early 1800s, it spent nearly 80 years being passed from one initially hopeful researcher to another, like some not-quite-housebroken puppy. In 1879, Thomas Edison finally figured out how to make an incandescent light bulb that people would buy. But that didn't mean the technology immediately became successful. It took another 40 years, into the 1920s, for electric utilities to become stable, profitable businesses. And even then, success happened only because the utilities created other reasons to consume electricity. They invented the electric toaster and the electric curling iron and found lots of uses for electric motors. They built Coney Island. They installed electric streetcar lines in any place large enough to call itself a town. All of this, these frivolous gadgets and pleasurable diversions, gave us the light bulb."

Ms. Taymor's lawyers, who regard the outline as crucial to her copyright claims and battle for more than $1 million from the producers, countered that the document reflected what they termed originality and the singular vision that she had demonstrated as the Tony Award-winning director of ''The Lion King.'' The two-hour hearing on procedural motions was the first oral argument in the case before Judge Katherine B. Forrest of federal district court in Manhattan. Judge Forrest - who at one point revealed that she knew plenty of Spider-Man minutiae, thanks to her 10-year-old son - bore down on the copyright claim for the script outline, which was the most complex issue before her. The judge said she would issue rulings soon; a jury trial on the case is to start in early 2013."

Then, when you come along and file your (real) tax return, the Internal Revenue Service flags it because one with the same Social Security number has already been submitted. The agency then processes your return manually and scrutinizes everything in it, to authenticate your identity and determine which return is legitimate. The result is months of delays in processing your return and any refund you may rightly be owed."

2012-06-02T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (Starz) THE IDES OF MARCH (2011) George Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon got an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay for this political drama, which Mr. Clooney also directed and stars in. The film concerns Mike Morris (Mr. Clooney), a Pennsylvania governor turned dream candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. Ryan Gosling, above, plays Stephen Meyers, a hotshot tactician who becomes involved with an intern (Evan Rachel Wood) with a powerful daddy and a secret that could derail Stephen's career and the Morris campaign. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are the senior advisers battling for Stephen's loyalty. And Marisa Tomei is a reporter trying to get at the truth. ''Mr. Clooney handles the plot complications with elegant dexterity,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this adaptation of Mr. Willimon's play ''Farragut North,'' loosely based on the 2004 Democratic primary campaign of Howard Dean. ''As an actor, he works best in long, understated scenes that allow him to play with nuances of charm and menace, so it is not surprising that, as a director, he gives the rest of the cast room to work,'' Mr. Scott added. ''But the parts of 'The Ides of March' -- quiet scenes between Mr. Gosling and Ms. Wood; swirling, Sorkinesque exchanges of banter; any time Ms. Tomei or Max Minghella (as a campaign worker grooming himself to be the next Stephen Meyers) are in the room -- are greater than the whole.'' 8 P.M.
