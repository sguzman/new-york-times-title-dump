These include the first commissioned works of Mr. MacKay's tenure, which began in 2008. The first will be ''Oscar,'' based on the life of Oscar Wilde, composed by Theodore Morrison, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan, with a libretto by the director John Cox, who has staged six productions for Santa Fe. Drawing heavily on Wilde's descriptions of his ordeals during two years of imprisonment, as well as his letters and documents from his contemporaries, ''Oscar'' will star the countertenor David Daniels in the title role. Mr. Daniels is currently singing the role of Roberto in the Santa Fe Opera's production of Vivaldi's ''Griselda.'' Mr. Cox and Kevin Newbury will direct."

2011-08-12T00:00:00Z,"The Metropolitan Museum of Art has officially canceled plans to loan works by the fashion designer Paul Poiret to Moscow's Kremlin Museum, as part of the ongoing fallout from a legal dispute that has halted all loans from Russian to American museums. ''It's really a matter of fairness and equity,'' the Met's spokesman, Harold Holzer, said. As long as Russia's ''loan embargo is in place,'' Mr. Holzer said, ''this museum believes it can no longer lend to Russian museums.'' The Met was to lend 35 Poiret works to the show, which is scheduled to open at the Moscow museum on September 6. The cancellation of the loans was first reported by the New York Observer. The Russian embargo stems from a dispute in which the Brooklyn-based Chabad-Lubavitch organization is seeking the return from Russia of a large collection of books and religious documents. Assembled over two centuries by Chabad leaders, the collection was looted by the Nazis and later seized by the Russians. On July 30, 2010, a federal judge ruled in the dispute in favor of Chabad, ordering Russia to turn over the collection. But Russia has so far refused to comply. In the meantime, Russian officials have warned museums there that any art they lend to the United States could be seized as potential leverage. American diplomats and museum officials have tried to reassure Russian museums that works on loan are immune from seizure, but so far their assurances have not been enough to satisfy the Russians. Several Met shows have been affected, including ''Cezanne's Card Players'' and ''Rooms with a View.'' ''Everyone here is saddened'' that the long tradition of mutual loans has been affected, Mr. Holzer said, adding that ''as a gesture of goodwill and friendship,'' the Met would be sending something to the Moscow museum: namely, some of the scenic backdrops from its own Poiret exhibition, in 2007. ''We feel we can't send over the actual art,'' he said, but ''we're sending over the backdrop material.''"

Whether bestowed on the lips, the cheek, the hand or any other part of the anatomy, the simple application of the lips to someone else's body can illuminate all sorts of different, and often contradictory, feelings. I was recently reminded of the theatrical power of the kiss when I saw the Sydney Theater Company's superb visiting production of ''Uncle Vanya'' at the Kennedy Center in Washington.

2011-08-13T00:00:00Z,"When ensembles that play mostly standard repertory take on contemporary works, they think of it as stretching, a broadening of their horizons. Perhaps it's the same for a group like the International Contemporary Ensemble when it turns its attention to Mozart and, in the context of its usual wet-ink repertory, Schoenberg, as it did in a Mostly Mozart concert on Thursday evening at Alice Tully Hall. Or maybe not: however these players spend their time now, they lived and breathed the standard repertory during their student years, which were not long ago. Still, it seemed strange to hear this superb new-music group navigating Mozart's ''Gran Partita'' (K. 361) in the second installment of its Mostly Mozart residency. It was assuring, too: listeners who dislike new music (or early music on period instruments, for that matter) insist that musicians who specialize in these repertories do so because they are weak in the ''real'' stuff. But the ensemble's fresh, vital performance vanquished that argument, as did its taut, essentially Romantic rendering of Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1."

2011-08-14T00:00:00Z,"DEBT spirals: the term sounds ominous. As it should — these market vortexes are posing grave dangers to the global economy right now. A national debt crisis is a bank run writ large, says Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard and co-author with Carmen M. Reinhart of “This Time Is Different,” a history of financial crises. When a country like Greece goes deep into debt, bond investors start to worry they won’t get their money back. What can happen next is a debt spiral, a vicious circle of sinking confidence, rising borrowing costs and, ultimately, rising debt burdens. As investors lose confidence in a country, its bond prices drop, its bond yields rise and its government must pay higher interest rates to borrow. That, in turn, deepens the debt problem — and the whole thing starts over again. Debt spirals are dangerous, but they aren’t inevitable. “Country debt crises are essentially political,” Mr. Rogoff says. Governments can often stem the crisis by reducing spending, raising taxes or both. But such steps are particularly difficult — and politically unappetizing — when growth is slack, as it is now in much of the world. Tightening the belt slows growth even more, eroding tax revenue and — you guessed it — increasing the debt burden, at least in the short term. Of course, the best way to avoid a debt spiral is to avoid running up a lot of debt in the first place — when the economy is doing well. “If you walk outside without a raincoat and the sun is shining, you are fine,” Mr. Rogoff says. “But if it starts pouring, you are going to get wet.” — <em>DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN</em>"

A gifted endocrinologist, scientist and teacher, Dr. Peterson provided leadership and inspiration that built the reputation of the Division and launched numerous young physicians on a career in academic medicine. An accomplished biochemist, he was one of the very first to use isotopes in metabolic investigations in human disease, advancing our understanding of steroid hormones, metabolism and inherited diseases. As a basic science researcher, he was part of the team that described 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, leading to the development of an inhibitor for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and male pattern baldness. A brilliant and kind man, he will be greatly missed. We offer our heartfelt condolences to the entire Peterson family. Antonio M. Gotto Jr., M.D. Dean Andrew I.

Coffee made by letting grounds and cool water steep overnight was nearly impossible to find in the city as recently as 2008; now it's everywhere, plied at a pushcart on the High Line and swigged from Stumptown's stubbies outside the Ace Hotel. Kickstand, the coffee cart on a bike that pedals around Brooklyn, is getting into the act, delivering cold brew to neighborhoods in the borough and parts of Manhattan. And while most of the other coffee comes ready to drink, Kickstand's is a 16-ounce concentrate that you dilute to taste. This means you can also mix it with a simple syrup and freeze it.

2011-08-14T00:00:00Z,"SINCE their debut record, ''North Hills,'' came out two years ago, the folk-rock band Dawes has been eliciting comparisons to some illustrious names: Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young; the Eagles; the Band. Partly this has to do with the mythology surrounding their first album: they recorded it at the producer Jonathan Wilson's studio in Laurel Canyon after playing a run of small hootenannies there. But mostly it has to do with their sound, which has a warm, stripped-down Americana feel frequently described as vintage. Recently, the group got about as big a nod as four guys playing folk rock could hope for: Robbie Robertson, the somewhat reclusive songwriter from the Band, asked them to back him in a series of rare performances. Dawes is now on tour to promote its follow-up record, ''Nothing Is Wrong,'' which was recorded on a setup of entirely analog gear that included a timeworn Studer tape machine owned by Jackson Browne.

I first met Éster through her former employer, a successful plastic surgeon, for whom she'd worked as his personal cook. Éster lived nearby in Vidigal, a favela near the brilliant white sand beach of Leblon. One day after she'd prepared dinner for his family she shyly told him in private, ''Doutor, I want to put in silicone.'' After reading up on prosthetic materials in an Internet café, she'd settled on a midcost model of breast implant (about $900) and convinced the doctor that she was a good candidate. Hesitant to perform the surgery on his domestic employee, he referred her to a young resident in the clinic of Dr. Ivo Pitanguy, Brazil's most influential plastic surgeon."

The article by Mr. Healy about the coming revival of ''Porgy and Bess'' is dismaying on many levels. To begin with, the title of the show is now ''The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess.'' I assume that's in case anyone was worried it was the Rodgers and Hart ''Porgy and Bess'' that was coming to town. But what happened to DuBose Heyward? Most of the lyrics (and all of the good ones) are his alone (''Summertime,'' ''My Man's Gone Now'' ) or co-written with Ira Gershwin (''Bess, You Is My Woman Now''). If this billing is at the insistence of the Gershwin estate, they should be ashamed of themselves. If it's the producers' idea, it's just dumb."

2011-08-14T00:00:00Z,"DEBT spirals: the term sounds ominous. As it should -- these market vortexes are posing grave dangers to the global economy right now.A national debt crisis is a bank run writ large, says Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard and co-author with Carmen M. Reinhart of ''This Time Is Different,'' a history of financial crises. When a country like Greece goes deep into debt, bond investors start to worry they won't get their money back. What can happen next is a debt spiral, a vicious circle of sinking confidence, rising borrowing costs and, ultimately, rising debt burdens. As investors lose confidence in a country, its bond prices drop, its bond yields rise and its government must pay higher interest rates to borrow. That, in turn, deepens the debt problem -- and the whole thing starts over again. Debt spirals are dangerous, but they aren't inevitable. ''Country debt crises are essentially political,'' Mr. Rogoff says. Governments can often stem the crisis by reducing spending, raising taxes or both. But such steps are particularly difficult-- and politically unappetizing -- when growth is slack, as it is now in much of the world. Tightening the belt slows growth even more, eroding tax revenue and -- you guessed it -- increasing the debt burden, at least in the short term.Of course, the best way to avoid a debt spiral is to avoid running up a lot of debt in the first place -- when the economy is doing well. ''If you walk outside without a raincoat and the sun is shining, you are fine,'' Mr. Rogoff says. ''But if it starts pouring, you are going to get wet.''"

I first met Éster through her former employer, a successful plastic surgeon, for whom she'd worked as his personal cook. Éster lived nearby in Vidigal, a favela near the brilliant white sand beach of Leblon. One day after she'd prepared dinner for his family she shyly told him in private, ''Doutor, I want to put in silicone.'' After reading up on prosthetic materials in an Internet café, she'd settled on a midcost model of breast implant (about $900) and convinced the doctor that she was a good candidate. Hesitant to perform the surgery on his domestic employee, he referred her to a young resident in the clinic of Dr. Ivo Pitanguy, Brazil's most influential plastic surgeon."

Unquestionably antique yet eerily familiar, the likenesses suggest that certain urban faces occur and reoccur, reborn, perhaps, in new bodies across the span of time. Take, for instance, Henry Freymuller, a laborer arrested on a burglary charge in November 1911. Put him in a Jeter jersey with a Heineken in his hand and Mr. Freymuller could have been spotted at Tuesday night's Yankees game."

A cleanup began in earnest three years ago when a handful of Madrileño entrepreneurs and local merchants noticed that the bones of these ancient byways, which are located between Madrid's Malasaña neighborhood and Gran Vía boulevard, were charming. Anchored by 400-year-old churches and a crumbling but magnificent 19th-century theater, properties in the area were soon bought up and rehabbed in a focused effort to woo artists, boutique owners and chefs into what were once brothels and sex shops. The result has been a flowering of commerce, and a flurry of new restaurants, shops and watering holes. Though some prostitution lingers, the popular press has taken to calling the area Madrid's ''new Soho.''SARAH WILDMAN"

He had never seen one larger. He needed it. But you try convincing your girlfriend that your studio -- which already looks like the Flintstones' prop room -- just needs one more boulder. ''I was like, 'The whole point about me growing as an artist is I have to grow in all of these different directions,' '' Mr. Distenfeld recalled saying."

2011-08-15T00:00:00Z,"Disney's high-profile remake of ''The Lone Ranger'' has ridden into the sunset, at least in its current configuration. That long-gestating movie project -- starring Johnny Depp as Tonto, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Gore Verbinski -- was expected to start shooting in October in New Mexico. But Walt Disney Studios pulled the plug late Friday after reaching an impasse with the filmmakers over costs, according to an industry official briefed on the matter who asked for anonymity because the details of the shutdown were considered private. A Disney spokesman declined to comment. Disney, according to the official, was willing to spend $200 million -- still an enormous amount of money for a western, which is perhaps Hollywood's riskiest genre -- but Mr. Bruckheimer and his team had sought a budget closer to $250 million. Hi-yo Silver and a-waaay with the entire project?"

(Ms. Steinem kept secret the abortion she'd had at the age of 22.) On Aug. 26, 1970, she helped lead the Women's Strike for Equality on the 50th anniversary of the enactment of women's suffrage. By 1972 she had co-founded Ms. Magazine, beginning her ascent as the public face of feminism. This documentary from Peter Kunhardt chronicles Ms. Steinem's life through interviews and archival footage. Topics include her childhood in Toledo, Ohio; the inspiration for her work; her battle with breast cancer; and her late-in-life marriage and subsequent widowhood. Barbara Walters, Helen Gurley Brown, Phil Donahue and Larry King weigh in. 8 P.M.

''The Help'' (DreamWorks Studios/Disney) was second with about $25.5 million for a total of $35.4 million since opening on Wednesday; a notably large African-American audience turned out for this film, an adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's best-selling novel about black maids working for white women in the 1960s.

That, and the roaring of the crowd. The crowd actually might have been more intimidating than my opponent: me, a single boxer, against a mass of people. Boxing is a sport I cherish, roaring crowds and all. It is, of course, not a modern sport. But although I knew the sport had been covered many times, I realized that it had always been about the training and the fighting. The fans had largely been ignored. So I started taking pictures of boxing fans in all kind of venues in and around New York. At first, the feeling of facing these people to take their picture was pretty similar to that first fight of mine in 2009. I expected to encounter intense emotions. Still, the strength of them surprised me. My work as a photographer, then, was about recreating this strange mix of expected and unexpected."

Now that animosity has carried over to a new musical based on the movie. In a complaint filed last week, the Writers Guild of America accused the producers of the movie of exploiting the screenwriter's rights by producing a new musical based on the story. The complaint claims that the guild's contract with producers says that two years after a movie's general release the right to adapt it into a stage play reverts to the screenwriter. According to The Hollywood Reporter, which first reported the claim, the screenwriter, Jessica Bendinger, had been trying to develop her own stage adaptation of ''Bring It On'' when she learned that the film's producer, Beacon Communications, was doing so as well. Beacon's version, which is directed and choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler (''In the Heights''), with a book by Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q''), and music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda (''In the Heights''), Tom Kitt (''Next To Normal''), and Amanda Green (''High Fidelity''), had a run earlier this year in Atlanta and is set to begin a 10-city national tour in Los Angeles on Oct. 30."

On Tuesday, two publishers announced forthcoming books on Mr. Perry, The Associated Press reported. Metropolitan Books will publish a work, with an unprintable title, by James C. Moore, the co-author of ''Bush's Brain,'' and the Texas political consultant Jason Stanford in early 2012. The book, to be subtitled ''Why Rick Perry Will Make America Miss George W. Bush,'' will describe Mr. Perry as an ''ideologue with scant interest or success in governing,'' according to the publisher's announcement. Crown, meanwhile, said it would publish ''Rick Perry and his Eggheads,'' by Sasha Issenberg, as an e-book next week. The e-book, about Mr. Perry's successful 2006 re-election campaign, is based on Mr. Issenberg's larger work, ''The Victory Lab,'' which is expected in the fall of 2012 and is to explore how social science and statistical analysis are changing political campaigning.

We even make a point of ordering different things to make the most of our shared dining experience. This was the target of rude snubs in France. Last week, I dined with my cousin, her French husband and their friends. My cousin and I ate half our dishes, then swiftly and silently exchanged plates, exercising extra discretion in this company. One of my cousin's friends called us out on it, even making a remark about our Chinese heritage. (We consider ourselves international and primarily speak English.) I was totally offended and bewildered. What's the etiquette on food-sharing at Western restaurants, where everyone chooses their own main courses, unlike at the Chinese table? And isn't it antisocial to guard your chosen dish, without offering to share the delights of the dinner table?"

2011-08-17T00:00:00Z,"10:45 A.M. (IFC) THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (2007) In 1995 Jean-Dominique Bauby, a 43-year-old French fashion magazine editor and something of a playboy, had a stroke that left him with a condition called locked-in syndrome, in which he retained vision, hearing and a perfectly functioning mind, but his body was almost completely paralyzed. He told his story in a book that he dictated to an assistant by blinking his eye. In this third feature film from the artist Julian Schnabel, Bauby is played by Mathieu Amalric (above, with Anne Consigny); Emmanuelle Seigner is Céline, the longtime partner he has recently left and the mother of his three children; and Marie-Josée Croze is the speech therapist who teaches him to use his left eyelid to communicate. ''The phrase 'triumph of the human spirit' hovers over 'The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,' along with a swarm of other empty, uplifting clichés,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''But Mr. Schnabel and the screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have other themes in mind'' -- among them, limitation, constraint and incarceration -- Mr. Scott said. (Both men were nominated for Oscars.) ''Their common subject, however, is freedom, the self-willed liberation of a difficult, defiant individual,'' which Mr. Schnabel demonstrates with ''imaginative freedom in every frame and sequence, dispensing with narrative and expository conventions in favor of a wild, intuitive honesty.'' 6 A.M. (TCM) SUMMER UNDER THE STARS: HUMPHREY BOGART ''Bogart: The Untold Story'' (1996), Chris Hunt's documentary, narrated by Stephen Bogart, the son of Bogart and Lauren Bacall, introduces this 13-film tribute to an actor whose gangster persona cloaked an adolescence of privilege in New York City and at Phillips Academy in Massachusetts. Highlights include ''To Have and Have Not'' (1944), in which Ms. Bacall made her film debut (above, with Bogart) in Howard Hawk's adaptation of the Hemingway novel, at 11; ''The Maltese Falcon'' (1941), John Huston's take on Dashiell Hammett's novel, and his directorial debut, at 8 p.m.; and ''Sahara'' (1943), with Bogart as an American tank commander fighting alongside seasoned British troops in Libya in 1942, at 10.

One of the country's premier interventional endoscopists, he helped develop minimally invasive techniques for treating pancreatic and biliary disease, including by pioneering single-operator cholangios- copy and making this technique a standard of care. He was also the first gastroenterologist in New York to help perform natural orifice translumenal endoscopic sur- gery. A longtime member of our medical center community, Dr. Stevens received his undergraduate and medical degrees at Columbia and completed subsequent specialty training at New York -Presbyterian/Columbia. Dr. Stevens was a past president of the New York Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and founded the NYSGE course for advanced fellows. He established the interventional endoscopic fellowship at New York - Presbyterian/ Columbia, and many of his trainees have gone on to prominent faculty positions as interventional endoscopists.

2011-08-17T00:00:00Z,"McSHANE--Bruce W.,passed away on August 13, 2011. Born in Montclair New Jersey he was the son of Bruce Winthrop and Mary Crane. When he was 1, his father died in a car crash. Bruce was the brother of Leslie Anne Roach, Elizabeth Carter Conway, Devin McShane and Bryan McShane. After his mother remarried Gordon McShane in 1952, his family consisting then of Bruce and his older sister Leslie moved to San Raphael, California where Gordon worked. While they lived there Bryan and Devin were added to his family. In 1955 the family moved back to the east coast and took up residence in the Morristown area of New Jersey. In that year Carter was born. Bruce attended primary school at the Peck school in Morristown and in eighth grade entered Portsmouth Priory in Rhode Island as a second former. At Portsmouth in his senior year he co-captained the varsity football team and captained the wrestling team. That year he grappled to an undefeated record and was selected to the all New England Team. After graduation from Portsmouth he entered the University off Denver where he stayed for one year before volunteering for the US army draft in 1969. He did his basic training at Fort Dix, NJ and from there he went to Vietnam where he served for 15 months with the 101st Airborne in the signal corps as a Radio Telephone Operator. He was stationed mostly near the city of Hue towards the northern part of the country. There he saw much combat. In 1972 he was awarded the Bronze Star for meritorious service. After his return from Vietnam, he attended Castleton State college, earning his BA and then attended Vermont Law school in South Royalton, Vermont where he graduated with a law degree in their inaugural class. His first job out of Law School was with Marsh and McLennan in New York where he worked until he passed the New York State Bar exam at which point he joined the law firm of Rogers Hoge and Hills. In 1981 he married Celeste Marie Bertucci, a New Orleans native and together they had two daughters, Jessica Elizabeth and Kelley Tiernan. In 1984 before they had children Bruce and Celeste moved to Westport Connecticut, and the seeds of Bruce's interest in sailing sprouted, when a friend gave him an old Hobey Cat. On a daily basis he would jump into the boat after work and sail until dusk. In 1985 Bruce started his own law firm with Bill Johnston and named it Johnston and McShane. Their offices were located above Grand Central station in New York City. In 1999 he and John Flood started a sports marketing firm Old Iron. The firm represented sports figures in private marketing efforts. In 1995 Bruce and Celeste bought property in Watch Hill Rhode Island where they eventually built a house. Over the next ten years Bruce kept up his interest and love of boating in the waters surrounding Watch Hill and Newport mostly with motor craft.In 2006 after doing much research he bought the sailing yacht Summer Wind, a Little Harbor design, 47' in length, built in 1986. Over the last five years, Bruce sailed that vessel throughout the western waters of the Atlantic - much of it solo. His sailing adventures took him as far south as Cartagena, Colombia, to the east and west boundaries of the Caribbean and down to Bermuda several times. Bruce's love of boating and fascination with the sea drove him. Sailing became his love and his life. Bruce is survived by his siblings and his family. A funeral service with Full Military Honors will take place at the Watch Hill Chapel, 5 Bluff Avenue, Westerly, RI, on Thursday, August 18 at 1:00pm. In lieu of flowers donations may be sent to the Wounded Warriors Project: woundedwarriorsproject.org For online condolences, please go to: www.gaffneydolanfuneral home.com"
2011-08-17T00:00:00Z,"James Levine, the Metropolitan Opera's music director, has received two previously undisclosed back operations since the spring, when he canceled a Met tour to Japan and his schedule at the Tanglewood Music Festival, his brother said on Tuesday. But now, without the excruciating pain that has plagued him over the last several years because of back problems, Mr. Levine is planning to begin rehearsing at the Met right after Labor Day and has not canceled any performances, said his brother, Tom Levine. ''The surgeries have done what they're supposed to do,'' he added. The increasingly frail Mr. Levine, 68, has withdrawn from numerous performances in recent seasons because of various health problems. In March he stepped down as the music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Last year he had a major operation to address spinal stenosis, which causes painful compression of the spinal cord. But the pain returned last season, Tom Levine said. His brother did not respond to other measures. ''It made sense to do another surgery,'' Tom Levine said, and that happened on May 31. The stenosis problem recurred, so another operation came on July 20, timed to give him enough of a recovery and rehabilitation period so he could be ready to conduct at the Met. ''He's in very good spirits,'' Tom Levine said. ''He's very, very positive and very, very optimistic.'' The conductor is scheduled to make his first appearance of the season leading ''Don Giovanni'' on Oct. 13."

The lawsuit was filed in February by Ablene Cooper, a longtime maid for Ms. Stockett's brother's family in Jackson. In the suit, Ms. Cooper argued that the book's protagonist, Aibileen Clark, was clearly based on her given the first name as well as some other significant biographical details. The lawsuit, which sought $75,000 in damages, described the portrayal as offensive and ''emotionally upsetting.'' Such suits against an author generally have low odds of succeeding, but given that Ms. Cooper filed it with the blessing of her employers it raised some eyebrows in Jackson and elsewhere."

2011-08-18T00:00:00Z,"Thinking Cap is about work in progress in the world of ideas. 'EXAM HIGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT: EVIDENCE FROM NEW YORK CITY' a working paper by Roland G. Fryer Jr., professor of economics and faculty director of the Education Innovation Laboratory at Harvard University, and Will Dobbie, a predoctoral research fellow at the laboratory. THE QUESTION Each year millions of middle-school students nationwide spend angst-filled months waiting to hear if they scored high enough on an entrance exam to attend a selective public high school. In New York City alone more than 27,000 students apply for precious spots in the three best-known schools: Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Technical and Bronx High School of Science. What Mr. Dobbie and Mr. Fryer wanted to know was just how much of a difference attending one of these high schools makes in the long run for students with similar equal admissions test scores. Some proponents say the benefits of an environment of high achievers, more advanced coursework and higher expectations are obvious. Skeptics counter that these gifted and motivated teenagers would have done well no matter where they went. Students in these schools with low class ranks may even be less competitive when it comes to college admissions. They might be better off in less competitive environments or in schools with a wider range of student abilities. Because there are so many applicants of similar ability and achievement who are not accepted to these New York institutions, the authors were able to compare the average outcomes of students who graduated from different high schools. ''We provide the first causal estimate of the impact of attending an exam-high school in the United States on later outcomes,'' they write."

''Watch the Throne,'' Jay-Z and Mr. West's new joint album, sold 436,078 copies in the United States, according to Def Jam, one of the labels behind it. That's the second-biggest week for any album this year (behind Lady Gaga's ''Born This Way''), but it was less than the 500,000 that Billboard and others had predicted, perhaps due partly to its limited availability.

After rapidly building its brand of original programming around prestigious series like ''Mad Men'' and ''Breaking Bad,'' AMC has been roiled by behind-the-scenes disputes and controversies at every one of its signature shows, even the ones it hasn't started broadcasting yet. Although the network received 29 Emmy Award nominations in July, that was a rare bright spot amid months of developments that were often as gloomy as the art direction for its hit zombie-apocalypse drama, ''The Walking Dead'': MARCH 23 Questions are raised about whether the fifth season of ''Mad Men'' will have its premiere as scheduled in the summer, as AMC appears to be mired in a financial dispute with Matthew Weiner, the creator and show runner of the series, and Lionsgate, the studio that produces it. Mr. Weiner objects to the network's proposals to shorten episodes by two minutes (to make room for more commercials) and to cut the cast budget. ''I don't understand why, with all of the success of the show, they suddenly need to change it,'' Mr. Weiner says."

And then again, there are those movies that just live on forever: Ridley Scott, who directed that moody 1982 science-fiction film noir, will direct and produce a new feature that is being described as a ''Blade Runner'' follow-up for Alcon Entertainment, a Warner Brothers-based financing and production company, its press representatives said on Thursday. The original ''Blade Runner,'' which was adapted from the Philip K. Dick story ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'', starred Mr. Ford as a human bounty hunter (or is he?) charged with hunting down lifelike androids in a future version of Los Angeles (where Atari is apparently still a major video game publisher). Though the film got a mixed reception in its day (Janet Maslin called it ''muddled yet mesmerizing'' in her review for The New York Times), it has become a cult classic and released in at least seven different edits, with different endings depending on who was wielding the scissors."

Chris Pine, above right with Mr. Washington, is Will Colson, the new, hotheaded conductor Frank is charged with training. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said that Mr. Scott, working with the cinematographer Ben Seresin and some ace sound technicians, ''creates an unexpectedly rich world of chugging, rushing trains slicing across equally beautiful industrial and natural landscapes,'' adding, ''There is something mesmerizing about these trains and the men who run them, something nostalgic too, because they seem like history machines, summoning up a past lived and also imagined, as in, for starters, 'The Great Train Robbery' (1903), 'North by Northwest' (1959) and 'Speed' (1994).' '' Alas, she said, '' 'Unstoppable' doesn't belong in that company: its story is largely forgettable, and its pleasures are transitory, limited to the actors (including Rosario Dawson and Kevin Corrigan, working up a sweat back in dispatch) and to its moments of beauty and strange comedy.'' Still, despite some ridiculous action flourishes from Mr. Scott, ''with a handful of appealing actors in tow, he sure keeps that machine going.'' NOON (13) RICHARD HEFFNER'S OPEN MIND Richard W.

2011-08-21T00:00:00Z,"A knitwear designer gets discovered. A post from our upcoming Fall Women's issue. ''All of my knits are easy because I am not a very good knitter,'' says Alice Lemoine, 26 (above, right), as she pulls on what to the civilian eye appears to be the product of some very complicated engineering. The tangle of ropy, open stitches and sunbursts of crochet reveals itself, in the wearing, to be a cardigan. And, as Lemoine wraps it around her torso, it maps the contours of her body with the precision of a corset - that is, if a corset could ever be described as cozy. Lemoine, who is based in Paris, studied for a year at Esmod in Japan, where she picked up not just design but also patience. In typical fairy tale fashion, Rick Owens's partner, Michele Lamy, discovered her while she was still a student in Paris and helped her get her first collection into Dover Street Market. Owens then nudged her to commit to knitwear, dangling the opportunity to make pieces for his handmade Palais Royal collection as incentive. For fall, Lemoine has broken out under the label Le Moine Tricote, a play on her name that alludes to her monkish ways, ''working silently on my own.'' The collection includes shrunken jackets, tunic-length vests and charming cachecoeurs in blends of alpaca, mohair and bamboo. But don't expect cashmere anytime soon. ''I don't need luxury materials,'' she insists. ''The luxury is in the design.''"

2011-08-21T00:00:00Z,"In trying to marry the prissiness of the Victorians with the sexual revolution of the 1960s, Tabitha Simmons has come out with an English heritage collection that is a hybrid hoot. ''Like rockabilly shoes,'' the English designer says of her inspirations, ''but - more gothic.'' The 49 styles are indeed evocative of the British Isles, with a smattering of high-heel brogues, evening sandals with chandelier trim and suede boots that look like they stepped out of ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks.'' Compared to previous collections, it is slightly more macabre, yet Simmons, now in her fifth season, continues to demonstrate an ability to imbue classic styles with a modern twist. For example, the Edna heel, a reimagined stiletto loafer, ''is beetle-crusher when it's in black and white,'' she says, ''and then we did a red and leopard version that has an element of Victoriana.'' She's certainly got a bead on the new monarchy. A pair of nude silk slippers looks fit for a duchess or a Park Avenue princess. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2011-08-21T00:00:00Z,"Like many women nowadays, I shop for my bikinis in the snow and boots in the blistering heat. You could say I've adapted. There is a despairing time lapse between when collections are shown (spring in September and fall in February) and when those pieces are sold. (Fall hits stores as early as July, and spring in February.) And thanks to instantaneous gratification sites like Moda Operandi and Gilt Groupe, avid customers can now begin preordering directly from their favorite designers. ''I start planning the moment they walk down the runway,'' says the designer Margherita Missoni. But some months, like September, linger in a sort of shopping purgatory. The idea of scouring the racks while waiting for sales and holiday items to hit the floor seems outdated. And tired. So while we dally in the off-season, how does one find (and love) things to buy now? ''Seasons no longer matter so much since our life takes place in and between climatic spaces,'' Jil Sander says, referring to her +J collaboration with Uniqlo, which ends this year. ''I compose these collections with the thought of offering both sensible outerwear as well as attractive innerwear. The key is intelligent layering.'' And most would agree that special one-offs like +J, Missoni for Target and Alexa Chung for Madewell (which all become available in September) are meant to fill the a-bit-of-everything void: offering little tank tops to wear beneath hybrids of woolly-cotton dresses or as separates."

It is by the New York artist Michael Waugh and features, at a glance, three gorgeous, menacing eagles intertwined to form the rather gothic moniker of this magazine.

On our Web site, you can scroll across this remarkable work and read an account of a revolution in progress.

2011-08-21T00:00:00Z,"When Joan Smalls walks down a runway, she sometimes says to herself, ''Get outta my way, I'm coming through!'' And it's a mantra that has served her well. Last year, the 22-year-old model became the first Hispanic woman to represent Estee Lauder in its ads for cosmetics and skin care. Aerin Lauder may have touted Smalls as a ''global beauty,'' but it took a while for anyone to take notice. Smalls, who grew up in the Puerto Rican countryside, had been floating around the fashion industry since 2007, doing small-time runway shows for the likes of Benjamin Cho or Heatherette, or the occasional department-store catalog shoot, and she once appeared in a Ricky Martin video - but her look hadn't really caught on."

2011-08-21T00:00:00Z,"INSTEAD of ''Groundhog Day,'' the Bill Murray movie, we now have Fashion's Night Out. It never ends. On Sept. 8, designers will be at their posts, just as they were this time last year, and you can go through the madness all over again. This is truly the age of reiteration. F.N.O. was a good idea when it began, back in the depths of the recession when stores were virtually empty. But now it's a party, an institutionalized kickoff to Fashion Week, and though it apparently raises money for some causes, I have to believe that the costs of security, crowd control and entertainment, not to mention the traffic headaches, outweigh the actual benefits."

And maybe she was your grandma and you just discovered them. Or maybe your granny (great-granny?) was a weathered-but-gorgeous sharecropper, a Dust Bowl refugee in frayed frock and battered boots, only - wait! - what if those boots were splattered with glitter? This welter of odd references, this battered basket of inspirations, is the driving force behind Karen Elson's new line for Nine West, a collection that also contains a bracelet that Elson was somehow able to persuade Nine West honchos to engrave on its underside ''The truth is in the dirt.'' ''Thank God they were game,'' Elson says with a laugh."

Onstage she is luminous, a major chord of exuberance, swinging behind her stand-up bass, eyes closed, singing to the lights, an evangelist of joy in various cool time signatures. At breakfast, meanwhile, she was soft-spoken and contemplative, almost demure. Granted she was rushed, due to fly promptly to Paris, and then on to Prague and Montreux, Switzerland, where old jazz heads and new were already buying tickets to catch her live, performing from ''Chamber Music Society,'' the album that made her the first pure jazz musician to win the Grammy for Best New Artist."

A mere two years old, Kora has dedicated itself to creating ''trade not aid'' jobs by designing and marketing hand-fashioned pieces made from recycled bone, aluminum, brass, horn and now glass. ''The colors of the glowing green glass are incredible; it's so unlike animal horn,'' says Kora's co-founder Maxandra Short (above, left). Her partner, Amy Walker, adds, ''Glass necklaces still have an organic feel, because every piece is different.'' Indeed the latest offerings, like the necklace at right ($220; go to koradesigns.com), are a softer addition to the line's usually more brawny designs, which in the past have included tribal-inspired manacles and industrial-looking chains.

2011-08-21T00:00:00Z,"BUCKLEY--Richard D. 74, passed away on Sunday July 31st at Stony Brook University Hospital, after suffering a brain hemorrhage while at his home in Quogue, NY. Mr. Buckley was Chairman of the company that bears his name. He built Buckley Radio into an industry leader as one of America's last remaining privately owned and operated radio companies. Buckley Radio owns and operates seventeen radio stations across the country, including the flagship station WOR 710AM in New York City. WOR is the legendary New York City station, which features such celebrated broadcasters as John Gambling and Joan Hamburg and also is the voice of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's weekly radio address. Radio Ink Publisher Eric Rhoads said, Rick loved radio and his people so much that he resisted the temptation of being acquired by the bigger corporations because he knew his stations were best served in the hands of someone who put the basics of localism and entertainment first. Joe Bilotta, Chief Operating Officer of Buckley Radio, who has worked for Buckley for forty-two years, said of Rick, There was no more impassioned leader than Rick Buckley. He led the company in a way that reflected the family nature of his business. It has been said that Rick carried himself with a humility and self-effacing wit that endeared him to everyone in the industry. Just one month ago, Rick stood before the New York State Broadcasters' Association to accept membership in their Hall of Fame. Rick's words stood out for his passion about radio and his love of his family and company. A native New Yorker, born and raised in Bronxville, Rick began his career in 1960 as a page at NBC. Buckley Radio was founded in the mid-1950's by his father, Richard D. Buckley, Sr. as an independently owned radio broadcasting company. Following his father's death in 1972, Rick became president of the company. Rick was a past Chairman of the Board of the Radio Advertising Bureau, a Past Chairman of the Board of the Southern California Broadcasters' Association, and at the time of his death was the Treasurer of the Broadcasters' Foundation of America. He was also a past member of the Board of Trustees at his alma mater, the University of Miami, and a member of the President's Council. Rick was instrumental in establishing the Richard D. Buckley audio lab at the University of Miami School of Communications. Rick was an avid fisherman and boater and past Commodore of the Shinnecock Yacht Club. He had a life-long love of the ocean and spending time at the beach in Quogue, NY, where he enjoyed much of the past forty summers. He was a Patriot who took great pride in the nation's Armed Forces. He was a resident of Greenwich, CT, where he also maintained his corporate headquarters. Rick is survived by Connie, his wife of thirty-seven years; their daughter Jennifer Buckley Fox, Vice President and Director of Sales at WOR; son-in-law Chris Fox, who serves as a neurosurgeon and Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy; his sisters Martha Buckley Fahnoe and Dana Buckley Tomkins; brother Brad Buckley; and two loyal dogs, Sam and Sydney. The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Broadcasters' Foundation of America (broadcastersfoundation.org); or to the Richard D. Buckley Memorial Fund to support broadcasting at the University of Miami. Please send donations to: Richard D. Buckley Memorial Fund, University of Miami, P.O. Box 248053, Coral Gables, FL 33124 or give online to the fund at www.miami.edu/rbuckley. Funeral arrangements will be private. A memorial service in celebration of Rick's life will be held on Thursday, September 8 at 11am at Christ Church, 254 East Putnam Avenue, Greenwich, CT."

They met Conor Oberst on the Monsters of Folk tour in Sweden; he introduced them to the producer of their next album. When First Aid Kit passed through Nashville on their American tour, Jack White invited them to record for his label. Part of a proud folk tradition - they ''enjoy singing older songs,'' Johanna says - they chose to rework Buffy Sainte-Marie's ''Universal Soldier,'' a protest song from the '60s, whose message ''is unfortunately still very relevant today.''

The relentless momentum of mundane existence is stilled by the shutter, and some of the mysteries implicit in everyday life open up. A moment -- of high artifice or raw candor, of posed elegance or composed chaos -- is captured and then, later, delivered to our contemplative gaze. We, the beholders, are always late to the scene, which makes looking at a photograph a species of time travel. We look back, aware, at least unconsciously, that the world has moved on. After a while, so do we, turning the page and returning the image to its natural state as a permanent piece of ephemera. But sometimes we wonder: What happened next?"

What he likes about the Pradas, he explains, is ''the mix of sharp tailoring and casual leisure.'' Having held his post for little over a year, he has pushed Adidas to hybridize in a similar manner. ''When I'm in Berlin and I see how the young guys and girls are dressing, none of them are wearing sneakers anymore. So you think, if these are the target consumers, and we are only selling sneakers, well, what are we going to do?'' The answer may be found in Adidas SLVR. Priced somewhere between Originals and Y-3 (also under Schoenberger's purview), the line has been reimagined for fall under his personal design stewardship. ''It's amazing for such a big company to be so open for discussions,'' he says. With SLVR, it is a ''new approach but still very much in the language of Adidas.''

Sexy kittens stalked plenty of fall runways, but the fiercest felines of all were found at Roberto Cavalli (below left) and Mugler (below right). According to Val Garland, who did the makeup at Mugler, all you need is a great black pencil or fab liquid liner to try this look at home. For soft-focus bedroom eyes, she suggests using Estee Lauder Artist's Eye Pencil in soft black. Smudge gently with a finger for desired depth and use a Q-tip to coax color into the lash line. For a more precise line, try a liquid product like M.A.C. Penultimate or Lancome's Artliner. ''They're fast and to the point,'' she says. ''A thick angular line from start to finish is very vixen.''

It can be bold, nearly all-over color, color on the ends (Kate Bosworth's has turquoise tips) or color on the sly -- a layer of, say, chartreuse revealed only when the hair is pulled into a pony. Mr. Gallagher says that the more complicated the progression of color, the more difficult it is to create at home. ''This look is pulled directly from the punk era, so we never want it to look too precious,'' he said. He calls what he does ''perfected imperfections.'' Pipino 57, 115 East 57th Street.

2011-08-21T00:00:00Z,"MASON, Ohio - The Scotsman Andy Murray makes an inviting target for the British tabloids, especially during the Wimbledon fortnight when his every move - from his cheese pizza delivery order to his stepping out to the London theater - is reported. After the News of the World phone-hacking scandal broke, it came to light that potentially thousands of individuals had been targeted by the tabloid, including the movie stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Sienna Miller, Jude Law and Hugh Grant. Does Murray, who defeated Mardy Fish on Saturday in the semifinals of the Western and Southern Open, have any reason to believe he may have been among the hacking victims?"

2011-08-21T00:00:00Z,"It started when my very Parisian friend, staying at my New York apartment, hand-washed her lingerie and neatly hung the coordinating pairs along the shower rod. Bras and panties in tandem styles: frilly florals by Only Hearts, nude sheers from Eres and a hot pink number that could have only been from Agent Provocateur. So French, so chic. I squirmed in my mismatched red cotton briefs and orange satin bra. Why had it never dawned on me to match? ''I only started buying sets when I got married,'' says the author and Vogue contributing editor Plum Sykes, remembering a pistachio and cream lace combo she fell in love with on the Rue des Saints-Peres in Paris. ''Young women today seem to be more aware of the trend for beautiful matching lingerie,'' says Cynthia Gabay, Myla's creative director.

2011-08-21T00:00:00Z,"I moved to Brooklyn in July of 2004, just in time to watch my mother die. She was supposed to be getting better; the chemo was working. I'd rented an apartment with Jay, this cute guy I'd started dating. But a week after pulling up in a U-Haul, I found myself cleaning out my childhood home with my siblings. Our parents were both gone now; anything that we couldn't take with us had to fit in a 20-cubic-yard Dumpster. I could barely squeeze the little I saved into the one-bedroom Jay and I shared. Jay (who held me up at the funeral and painted our place all my favorite colors and quickly proved to be much more than just a cute guy) had to shimmy sideways to get between my father's easy chair and my mother's broken desk."

When Erica, a budding author, isn't swaddled in her security sweater, she rocks fierce pieces from Alexander McQueen, Preen, Erdem and Norma Kamali (''so old school'') as well as a vintage collection that would make Kate Moss weep. She opts for high street style from the likes of H&M and Topshop when the mood strikes. ''There's no shame in my game,'' she says. ''I am not a slave to labels."

Surrounded by acacia trees on the banks of the Loing River in Fontainebleau, the tiny clapboard cottage is only 35 miles southeast of central Paris, but it feels worlds away, thanks to its untamed, verdant surroundings and lack of mod cons like electricity, heat and plumbing. (You flush the loo the old-fashioned way - with buckets of water hand-pumped from a spring.) The spartan setting suits the family just fine.

Baseball America ranked Bell the best corner outfielder in the draft, but his commitment to the University of Texas scared off other teams. The Pirates took him anyway, reasoning that if Bell did not sign, they would get a similar pick as compensation next year. And if he did sign, they would have the equivalent of two upper-first-round talents."

By 2006, Costco had installed 90 chargers at 64 stores, mostly in California but also some in Arizona, New York and Georgia. Even after General Motors crushed its EV1 battery cars, the Costco chargers stayed in place.

2011-08-21T00:00:00Z,"SAUVAGEOT--Henry E. Henry E. Sauvageot, deeply beloved brother of Diane Sunnen, Charles Sauvageot and Anne-Laure Houghton, uncle to Dari Handjani, Alexandra Houghton and Nicholas Houghton, nephew to Ellen-Mary and Richard Soule, cousin to Roland Soule, Debby Soule Apple and Rod Soule, passed away suddenly at his home in Los Angeles on July 30, 2011. He was preceded in death by his beloved father, Jean Marie Sauvageot, his grandparents, former French Senator Edmond Sauvageot, Anne-Marie Sauvageot, Brig. Gen. Bradford G. Chynoweth (Ret.), Grace Woodruff Chynoweth and his uncle, W. Edward Chynoweth. Born August 11, 1955, Henry grew up in Belgium, Germany and France until he was 12, when his family moved to Berkeley. He attended Bentley School, Lick-Wilmerding High-School, U.C. Berkeley, the MBA program at Golden Gate University and the ITP Program, Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. He was a Creative Director, Information Architect and Interaction Designer who held leadership positions in the Interactive Solutions Design and Entertainment fields, having worked at Agency.com, HBO, Disney, Tryarc, PacifiCare and Oshyn, among other companies on a freelance basis, but his true calling was as a writer. In the course of his life he wrote three novels and five screenplays. Henry left the Bay Area to move to New York where he lived for 17 years before moving to Los Angeles in 2003. Henry was a unique and talented man, striving for perfection in all his endeavors. A writer who loved to read, his interests ranged widely. His reading interests included literature, history, psychology, comics, philosophy, artificial intelligence, film, chaos theory and yoga. Aside from his prolific reading and writing, he was a gifted athlete. He was an ace tennis player, having been a member of The Berkeley Tennis Club in his youth, and a natural and talented golfer. He also mastered swimming, surfing, fencing, archery, horseback riding and jazz dance. He loved nature and all his life had a deep connection to animals and the natural world. Henry's spirit was influenced by the variety of places he had lived throughout his life. One friend described his humor as having ""that New York edge."" At the same time, his deepest connection was to France where he spent much of his youth. Although single at the time of his death, Henry was married for five years in the 1980s and had several passionate relationships during his lifetime. He was a fundamentally shy and private man who unfortunately did not find the ""woman of his dreams"" during his time here on earth. Henry always encouraged those around him to reach for their better selves. His kind, sensitive and generous heart, nobility of mind and spirit and his magnanimous nature will be deeply missed by those who knew him best. In Pace Requiescat. A private service will be held by family. Donations can be made in Henry's memory to the U.C. Berkeley, Undergraduate Scholarship Fund, or to the Red Burns Scholarship Fund at NYU, Tisch School of the Arts, ITP Program."

2011-08-22T00:00:00Z,"Most of the putter talk after Keegan Bradley's Aug. 14 victory in the P.G.A. Championship was about how he became the first player to use a belly putter to win a men's major. Bradley used an Odyssey White Hot XG Sabertooth that was nearly 47 inches long. I'm a golf traditionalist, but I'm also tired of the debate. Long putters will never be banned at this point and they no doubt help some people keep playing golf. Let's get used to them. While covering the tournament, however, I was struck by how many players were using putters of a similar design to Bradley's Sabertooth. Odyssey and several other makers are churning out models with weighted flanges on either end of the putter head and a certain amount of open space directly behind the putter face. Although different in design, these putters seem like an evolution of the old reliable Two-Ball Odyssey putters - the first putters especially crafted to calm our wandering eyes over short putts."

2011-08-22T00:00:00Z,"It was a weekend of carnage at the box office, but not in the way that ''Conan the Barbarian'' had hoped. That gory remake, financed by Nu Image for about $90 million and distributed by Lionsgate, took in an anemic $10 million in North American theaters. A variety of factors probably contributed, including a lack of interest by women in the subject matter, terrible reviews and a release date when consumers were distracted with vacations or back-to-school preparations. Two other new films also flopped. A $30 million remake of ''Fright Night'' (DreamWorks Studios) sold $8.3 million in tickets, while the $15 million drama ''One Day'' (Focus Features) took in $5 million. ''The Help'' (DreamWorks) was No. 1, as strong word of mouth powered that period drama to an impressive $20.5 million in ticket sales for a two-week total of $71.8 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office statistics. ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes'' (20th Century Fox) was second, taking in about $16 million for a three-week total of $134 million. ''Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World'' (the Weinstein Company) was third with a humdrum $12 million in ticket sales. ''Conan,'' starring Jason Momoa (from ''Game of Thrones'' on HBO), was fourth and ''Fright Night'' fifth. ''One Day'' placed ninth."

Kennedy to South Africa in 1966, during some of the worst years of apartheid. Using archival footage and interviews, this documentary touches on Kennedy's ''Day of Affirmation'' speech of the University of Cape Town; his visit to Stellenbosch University, an intellectual center of Afrikaner nationalism; his meeting with Chief Albert J. Luthuli, the former leader of the African National Congress, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1960; and his journey to Soweto, the country's largest black township, where he gave voice to the chief's call for a free South Africa (above, Kennedy and his wife, Ethel, meeting the populace). 6 A.M.

2011-08-22T00:00:00Z,"For a lot of golfers, the late summer and approaching fall is the best time to play. It's less crowded and the air is crisper. A personal choice of mine is to head for the hills, where the foliage and scenery enhance every round. But if you play where there are elevation changes, you will find yourself with a lot of sidehill and downhill lies off the tee. If you are faced with this situation, the golf magazines and instruction manuals will tell you to aim more to the left when the ball is below your feet (for a right-handed golfer) and to aim more to the right if the ball is above your feet. Dan Spooner, the director of golf at the Leatherstocking Golf Course in Cooperstown, N.Y., has been a P.G.A. pro for more than 30 years. He has spent his career teaching students how to play off the uneven lies so common to golf courses in Central New York."

Liam also disputed his brother's claim that ''the demise of Oasis followed a massive row in which he claimed I demanded to advertise my clothing range Pretty Green in the Oasis tour program.''"

2011-08-22T00:00:00Z,"Pixar Animation Studios, battered a bit by critics of late for its embrace of sequels like ''Cars 2,'' announced two new original films over the weekend, although details were spare and both are still untitled. The first one is slated for Christmas 2013 and will tackle dinosaurs - specifically, what would have happened if they had not vanished. Bob Peterson, a two-time Oscar nominee for his screenwriting work on ''Up'' and ''Finding Nemo'' (and the voice of Roz the taskmaster slug in ''Monsters Inc.''), is directing this film. Pete Docter, who directed ''Up,'' will tackle the second project, which is headed toward 2014 and is set inside the human mind. (Hey, a lot of people thought ''Up'' sounded ridiculous, too.) The announcements were made at D23 Expo, a biannual event in Anaheim, Calif., dedicated to all things related to the Walt Disney Company. The three-day gathering, attended by about 40,000 fans, is designed to stir up the company's fan base by unveiling details about new films, television shows, merchandise and theme park attractions. The Pixar news was greeted with rapture, but the reaction was tepid to exclusive footage from ''John Carter,'' an expensive fantasy set for March release about a Civil War veteran mistakenly transported to Mars. That film, which depicts sharply unattractive aliens, represents the live-action directing debut of Andrew Stanton, an Oscar winner for ''Wall-E'' and ''Finding Nemo.''"
2011-08-22T00:00:00Z,"GEBHARDT--Frances S.,died August 4, 2011 after brief Hospice care for her lung cancer. She was born in Greensboro, NC, on October 27, 1925. Her family moved to New York City in 1935, where Fran lived most of her joyous life. Her last days were spent surrounded by her devoted family. Loved by countless family and friends for her cheerful, optimistic outlook on life, she treasured and took pride in three areas. First came her loved and loving family. Her 67-year marriage to John bore a daughter, Claudia, and a son Jeff. Claudia is the mother of two outstanding girls, Dana and Lynn. Jeff and his wife Gonda add five more beautiful grandchildren: Aiyana, Taimah, Naomi, Maya, and Kaylee. Fran delighted in them, carrying pictures that she would show to anyone at a moment's notice. All looked forward to seeing Grandma Fran at every opportunity. She loved having them visit so that she could show them the sights of Manhattan. Her second source of pride was her 21 years with the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York. She admired this pioneer organization of group medical practice. Dozens of former co-workers remember her as supervisor, mentor, and colleague. They speak of her smile lighting up any room that she entered. After retirement Fran had a second career as a volunteer in the emergency room of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She comforted distraught patients and their worried relatives as only a calm and empathetic person could. After seventeen years she was honored as ""Best Volunteer of the Year."" She was deeply saddened by the closing of this vital resource in April of last year. She loved music of all kinds, living it rather than just hearing it. She also seemed almost to become part of the flowers, greenery, and trees that made the wonders of nature so important to her. Her buoyant and loving spirit will live on through her husband, children, grandchildren, and all of those who knew and loved her. Friends may call from 1 to 2pm at Andrett Funeral Home, 353 2nd Avenue, Manhattan, on Sunday, September 18, with a celebration of her life to follow at 2pm."

Some 2,500 events make up the multi-arts extravaganza, which continues through Aug. 29, and according to a recent article in The Scotsman, 188 of them are American theatrical productions, many of which originated in New York. (That's about the same number of shows, in total, playing at the New York International Fringe Festival, which finishes up this week.) The allure of Edinburgh remains powerful, even though another number - the price tag on bringing a show to Scotland - can be as daunting as the size of the festival itself. Beyond salaries and production costs, there are airline tickets, accommodations and daily expenses - beer, haggis and the like."

New York City had filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit by preservationists who charged that the owner of the building, Vornado Realty Trust, disregarded restrictions designed to protect the interior. But Justice Lucy A. Billings of State Supreme Court in Manhattan denied that motion last week and converted the temporary restraining order she issued last month into a preliminary injunction. It bars Vornado from doing additional work on the site until she considers the merits of the case. Preservationists consider the building - a former bank designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill - a model of Modernism. The building's transparent interior was designated a landmark in February. But two months later the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission allowed Vornado to change some of the elements in reconfiguring the space for a clothing store, Joe Fresh."

(HBO2) SUNSHINE STATE (2002) Real estate developers wreak havoc on a Florida beachfront resort in this multigenerational civics lesson from John Sayles, organized around the histories of two families, one white (the Temples), the other black (the Stokeses). Marly Temple (Edie Falco, above with Marc Blucas), a sardonic young woman who runs a strategically placed family motel, is the closest thing to a central character. Jane Alexander plays her grandly histrionic mother, and Ralph Waite is her partly blind curmudgeon of a father. Eunice Stokes (Mary Alice) is the revered pillar of Lincoln Beach, a black-owned, middle-class enclave that the developers are planning to obliterate. When her daughter (Angela Bassett) shows up with her husband (James McDaniel) after being exiled in disgrace 25 years earlier, old wounds bleed. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said that Mr. Salyes had created ''a cinematic mosaic of American lives unprecedented in its range, balance, subtlety and evenhandedness.'' By the end, he added, ''you feel you've not only touched the soul of each one but also tasted some salty essence of our national life. A crucial ingredient of that essence, the movie suggests, is a nagging, unappeasable restlessness that may be the emotional engine driving American capitalism.'' 8:15 A.M. (MoreMax) ADAPTATION (2002) The director Spike Jonze and the writer Charlie Kaufman (along with his fictional twin, Donald, who is also credited with writing the screenplay) journey into metafiction in this movie about the two Kaufmans (Nicolas Cage, in both roles) and Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep), a writer for The New Yorker whose book ''The Orchid Thief'' inspired the film.

2011-08-24T15:06:44Z,"Taavo Somer, the charismatic restaurateur behind Freemans and Peels, will open his third restaurant, Isa, on the south side of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, next month. Having spent the last two years building the space and embracing naïveté and improvisation - letting the design of the tables ""go where the wood wants to go,"" for example - Somer has coined the term ""primitive modernism"" to describe the restaurant's generally rustic look. ""It speaks to that part of us that longs for something real, organic, dirty and alive,"" he says, ""that wants to pick up some rocks, logs, meat and cook over a fire."" The menu, by the chef Ignacio Mattos, formerly of Il Buco, goes to wonderfully unexpected places and features succulent, fall-off-the-bone pig's tail, a bright consommé made with herbs from the restaurant's roof garden and a cashew-dressed vegan salad that tastes curiously like a classic Caesar. Is that a rebellion against the comfort food that's dominated New York tables? ""This is the most fun I've had in nine years,"" Somer says. ""We're trying things and making things. We just want to lose the fear, throw a little caution to the wind, dance badly and have a blast."""
2011-08-24T14:59:19Z,"For months, almost every development out of Libya seemed to confirm my initial pessimism about our quasi-war against Muammar Qaddafi. But happily that's changed in the last week, with the sudden collapse of his regime and the apparent victory of the rebels. As in post-Saddam Iraq and post-Taliban Afghanistan, many of the scenarios for what comes next in Libya could ultimately pose as many risks to American interests as Qaddafi himself ever did, and I agree with all the voices pointing out that the tyrant's fall doesn't necessarily vindicate our intervention, to say nothing of the dubiously legal means by which America was taken to war in North Africa. But I also think it's important for critics of the war to acknowledge the significance of the last few days' events. While few intervention skeptics ""maintained that we could not possibly defeat the regime"" (as Ramesh Ponnuru puts it), many of us worried that the administration's (understandably) risk-averse approach to the conflict might create a permanent stalemate, leaving an armed-and-dangerous Qaddafi in power in Tripoli while Western warplanes circled impotently overhead. Qaddafi's defeat doesn't necessarily promise a happy outcome in the long run, but at the very least it guarantees that we will be spared that particular worst-case scenario, while holding out the possibility of a Libya unified and at peace - rather than a Libya partitioned and perpetually patrolled by Western forces, which is where we seemed to be headed a month ago. Declarations of victory are ridiculously premature, but for a country and a White House starved for any sort of good news, the fall of Qaddafi should be cause for (suitably restrained) celebration."

2011-08-24T00:00:00Z,"6:30 P.M. (FX) THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008) Brad Pitt received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Benjamin Button, a man born in his 80s in 1918 New Orleans who ages in reverse into the 21st century in this adaptation of a whimsical short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Cate Blanchett (above with Mr. Pitt) is Daisy, the dancer who loves Benjamin at whatever stage he is in his life. And Taraji P. Henson, who also received an Oscar nod, is the nursing home caretaker who raises him when his father abandons him. From Fitzgerald's ''odd, somewhat unpromising kernel, the director David Fincher and the screenwriter Eric Roth have cultivated a lush, romantic hothouse bloom, a film that shares only a title and a basic premise with its literary source,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, adding that the film ''sighs with longing and simmers with intrigue while investigating the philosophical conundrums and emotional paradoxes of its protagonist's condition in a spirit that owes more to Jorge Luis Borges than to Fitzgerald.'' Above all, Mr. Scott said, the movie ''is a triumph of technique,'' with Mr. Fincher adding ''a dimension of delicacy and grace to digital filmmaking. While it stands on the shoulders of breakthroughs like 'Minority Report,' 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Forrest Gump' (for which Mr. Roth wrote the screenplay), 'Benjamin Button' may be the most dazzling such hybrid yet.'' The film won Oscars for art direction, makeup and visual effects. 8 A.M. (IFC) PAN'S LABYRINTH (2006) Guillermo del Toro directed this fable, set in a dark forest in Spain in 1944, about a young girl whose fantasies are trampled by her stepfather's fascist politics. The film, in Spanish with English subtitles, received Academy Awards for cinematography, art direction and makeup. Ivana Baquero plays the heroine, Ofelia, who longs to believe in fairies, princesses and magic lands; Doug Jones (above with Ms. Baquero) is the woodland creature (a couple of them, actually) who charges her with three tasks. ''Fairy tales (and scary movies) are designed to console as well as terrify,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''What distinguishes 'Pan's Labyrinth,' what makes it art, is that it balances its own magical thinking with the knowledge that not everyone lives happily ever after.''"

Mohamed Abdel Fattah, the head of the antiquities sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities, will become the council's secretary general, the position Mr. Hawass held before former President Hosni Mubarak elevated the council to a ministry. Mr. Sharaf had previously indicated that he planned to return the council to its former status. Mr. Abdel Fattah's positions are not well-known, and reaction to his appointment, which was first reported last week in the Egyptian press, has so far been muted. He was quoted by the Egyptian newspaper Al Masry Al Youm as pledging to resolve disagreements among the council's leadership and root out corruption. He said he would complete several unfinished construction projects, while cautioning that others would have to be postponed because of a lack of money. Much of the council's budget comes from ticket sales to museums and archeological sites, and tourism to Egypt has been decimated by the revolution."

She balanced her family, career and studies while still being active in her church (Holy Family in New Rochelle) and her community. As her granddaughter Kate Walsh wrote in a college paper about her, her roles as a mother, activist, and professor were intertwined throughout the era and helped fuel each other rather than come in conflict. The relationships she formed as a mother and professor pushed her to become active in social movements for the 1960s. Her involvement in the movements informed her parenting, and her role as a professor came into her life because of her experiences as a wife and mother. In the 1970s, with her family's support, Cay enrolled in the doctoral program at Fordham University. Unfortunately Hugh died suddenly in 1978 leaving Cay to raise her still young family so she did not complete her degree. She retired from teaching in 1994 and spent the remainder of her life traveling, reading, and spending time with her family and friends. Cay is survived by her seven children, Hugh (Janet), Thomas (Joan), Mary (William Walsh), Mark (Beth), David (Evelyn), Lawrence (Nancy) and Catherine (Jill), her seventeen grandchildren, Jennifer, Drew (Jodie), Sean, Glynis, Claire, Kate, Jack, Colin, Brian, Emily, Maura, Courtney, Alanna, Madeline, Mary, Hugh and Katherine and her six great-grandchildren Haley, Zachary, Serena, Nolen, Aria and Phoenix. Calling Hours at the Fred H. McGrath & Son, Funeral Home, Bronxville, between the hours of 6 to 9pm Wednesday, 2 to 5 and 7 to 9pm Thursday. Mass of Christian Burial will be held at the Holy Family Church, New Rochelle, on Friday Aug. 26th at 10:30am. Interment to follow at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery, Hawthorne, NY. In lieu of flowers, you may make a donation in Cay's name to Hope Community Services, 50 Washington Avenue, New Rochelle, NY 10801 914-636-4010 info@hope-cs.org."

He is survived by his loving wife of 63 years, Yvette, and his three children and five grandchildren. While working for General Applied Science Lab (GASL) from 1959-67, he designed the mission and trajectory analysis on supersonic combustion-powered hypersonic planes (SCRAMJET). As an engineer with Sperry Gyroscope from 1957-1959, he worked on missile aerodynamic design and performance and, from 1967-1984, on submarine design and weapons system engineering. He also worked for Lockheed (1948-1953). He earned BS and MS degrees in Aeronautical Engineering from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, where he won many awards, including Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi honor society memberships. He served in the Navy from 1942-46. He was later a volunteer at the Cradle of Aviation Museum, where he restored aircraft of significance to Long Island and served as a docent. He also had a great passion for many personal pursuits. He flew planes and gliders, sky-dived, drove race cars, was an ace rifle and pistol marksman and was an expert crossword puzzle solver. But most importantly, he was a compassionate, loving man and a great role model and friend to all who had the privilege of knowing him. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to Hospice Care Network (99 Sunnyside Blvd., Woodbury, NY) or the Cradle of Aviation Museum (516-572-4026)."

But the fall runway collections made a fairly convincing case for rethinking the role of outerwear in our wardrobes. Designers like Vera Wang, Alexander Wang and Joseph Altuzarra put parkas front and center in their shows, while hybrid styles of bombers, blanket coats, ponchos, peacoats, toggle coats and toppers appeared just about everywhere else. It was as if the fashion world was making a collective stand against those ubiquitous puffer jackets that make most of us look as if we're wearing bubble wrap."

But nowhere was the mod mood more pronounced than in the debut collection of Sofia Sizzi, whose elegantly tailored line, called Giulietta, was inspired by 1960s film and fashion.

Catherine McCabe (nee Henry), wife, mother, professor, counselor, friend and a long time resident of New Rochelle, NY died peacefully on Tuesday August 23 at age 85. A woman of great dignity, faith and affection, Cay was born on January 7, 1926 to John and Theresa Henry in the Bronx. She was raised in New Rochelle and was a 1947 graduate of the College of New Rochelle. Cay married Hugh McCabe in 1949 and with him raised seven children. While the older children where in school and the youngest were in pre-school, Cay earned two masters degrees, one in Theology at Manhattan College and one in Pastoral Counseling at Iona College. She had also begun her career as a professor of Religious Studies at Iona that would span more than 30 years and touch the lives of generations of Iona students. Cay and Hugh had a wonderful partnership including working at the college they loved, Iona. Both were participants in the social movements of the 60's. She balanced her family, career and studies while still being active in her church (Holy Family in New Rochelle) and her community. As her granddaughter Kate Walsh wrote in a college paper about her, her roles as a mother, activist, and professor were intertwined throughout the era and helped fuel each other rather than come in conflict. The relationships she formed as a mother and professor pushed her to become active in social movements for the 1960s. Her involvement in the movements informed her parenting, and her role as a professor came into her life because of her experiences as a wife and mother. In the 1970s, with her family's support, Cay enrolled in the doctoral program at Fordham University. Unfortunately Hugh died suddenly in 1978 leaving Cay to raise her still young family so she did not complete her degree. She retired from teaching in 1994 and spent the remainder of her life traveling, reading, and spending time with her family and friends. Cay is survived by her seven children, Hugh (Janet), Thomas (Joan), Mary (William Walsh), Mark (Beth), David (Evelyn), Lawrence (Nancy) and Catherine (Jill), her seventeen grandchildren, Jennifer, Drew (Jodie), Sean, Glynis, Claire, Kate, Jack, Colin, Brian, Emily, Maura, Courtney, Alanna, Madeline, Mary, Hugh and Katherine and her six great-grandchildren Haley, Zachary, Serena, Nolen, Aria and Phoenix. Calling Hours at the Fred H. McGrath & Son, Funeral Home, Bronxville, between the hours of 6 to 9pm Wednesday, 2 to 5 and 7 to 9pm Thursday.

The first three episodes, shown consecutively, look at the plans for the 1,776-foot One World Trade Center; construction progress; and the concept behind the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, which will use physical remnants from the attack, including first-response vehicles and the steel footings of the original towers, to recount the story of Sept. 11. 8:30 A.M.

''In the end, what gives me reluctant pause about this bright, cheery, hard-to-resist movie is that its joyfulness feels more like a filmmaker's calculation than an honest cry from the heart about the human spirit (or, better yet, a moral tale),'' she said, adding that Mr. Boyle ''plucked my heartstrings'' with ''well-practiced dexterity, coaxing laughter and sobs out of each sweet, sour and false note.''"

Most Broadway shows had been scheduled to go on this weekend. This is the first time since the theater stagehands' strike of 2007 that Broadway has closed down en masse; the last emergency shutdown of Broadway was in 2003, when a blackout closed theaters for a night. Before that, the last time Broadway was dark was following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. No show producers on Friday could recall weather-related conditions (let alone forecasts) shuttering all of Broadway as well as virtually all Off Broadway. The cancellations will probably amount to a loss of a few million dollars for Broadway shows; standard practice is for ticket-holders to be offered refunds or exchanges from their point of purchase."

""It's heavy in the cornerstone classics of music,"" says the Jam's curator, Sean Hanratty, of the list, which includes Leonard Cohen and the Clash. ""It's full of the timeless stuff that you never really lose, the records you own and would never part with."" Faithfull's first hit, ""As Tears Go By"" (1964), which Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and the Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham helped write, remains one of the best ballads of all time. The song, along with her highly publicized relationship with Jagger, put her on the map as one of rock's biggest stars. ""You Can't Always Get What You Want,"" on the Stones album ""Let It Bleed,"" released in 1969, was one of many songs written about Faithfull. ""I think some people forget - certainly not me - that she also co-wrote 'Sister Morphine,' "" says Hanratty of the track on the Stones's 1971 ""Sticky Fingers"" album. (The song is reportedly about her life and battles with drug abuse, specifically heroin.) For the past five decades, we have seen Faithfull reinvent herself as a performer and musician, in collaborations with the likes of David Bowie, Tom Waits, Emmylou Harris, Nick Cave and others, while keeping her place as one of the most influential female singer-songwriters of all time. ""With the impending hurricane and Virginia's earthquake, we are kind of in need of the classics,"" Hanratty says. Faithfull will perform her classics, as well as songs from this year's album, ""Horses and High Heels,"" at Manhattan's City Winery on Dec. 18."

A spokesman for the California Republican now says that the I.R.S. filing is ''an incorrect document.'' The spokesman, Frederick R. Hill, said that based on Mr. Issa's private brokerage account records, which he made public with redactions, the purchase of the mutual fund resulted in a $125,000 loss, not a $357,000 gain. And the article, using incorrect information from the San Diego county assessor's office, misstated the purchase price for a medical office plaza Mr. Issa's company bought in Vista, Calif., in 2008. It cost $16.3 million, the assessor's office now says -- not $10.3 million -- because the assessor mistakenly omitted in public records a $6 million loan Mr. Issa's company assumed in the acquisition. Therefore the value of the property remained essentially unchanged, and did not rise 60 percent after Mr. Issa secured federal funding to widen a road alongside the plaza."

She was the first woman president of the City Club of New York. The 450 member good-government group, founded in 1892, called itself ""the oldest continuously active, non-partisan, voluntary civic organization in the country"". Until 1974, its membership was limited to men. Sally described her favorite method of operation as ""bagel diplomacy"". She would say, ""I have people over to my apartment between 8 and 9:30am and I feed them and keep them talking for as long as it takes to chew through a whole bagel. Stanley Zabar once said he knew the state of the city by the size of my bills"". The City Club was perhaps best known for its monitoring of city government administrations in the areas of zoning, landmarks, financing, delivery of services, housing and transportation. It held Friday luncheon meetings with prominent speakers, and each year sponsored the prestigious Bard Awards for Excellence in Architecture and Urban Design. The Club sponsored its famous ""Distinguished New Yorker"" Award annually at a gala black-tie dinner. It also published a critical monthly newsletter, The Gadfly. In describing her work at the City Club, Sally Goodgold said, ""I try to fill the potholes in government. You can be both an innovator and a traditionalist all in the same dress"". Mrs. Goodgold was an energetic, talkative woman with a wry sense of humor whose hands were constantly in motion when she spoke. She said that one of her shining moments as a community activist occurred in 1975 when she walked into City Hall with a Federal check for $13 million for the repair of the crumbling West Side Highway between 72nd and 82nd Streets. She said that she and the late State Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal had managed to convince Federal officials that the West Side Highway, because it was elevated, was really a bridge and therefore entitled to an appropriation from the Federal Bridge Repair Fund.

Finance ought to provide an economy with an efficient means of allocating capital. It should provide a means of price discovery of assets, whether real or financial. It should provide a safe and reliable payments system. Financial innovations are worthwhile if, and only if, they help in those areas."

2011-08-26T00:00:00Z,"9 A.M. (Bravo) MILK (2008) Sean Penn (above) won the Oscar for best actor for his performance as the title character in this biopic from Gus Van Sant. Mr. Penn portrays Harvey Milk, a neighborhood activist elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 -- and one of the first openly gay elected officials in the country -- who was killed the next year, along with the city's mayor, George Moscone (Victor Garber), by a former supervisor, Dan White (Josh Brolin). Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called the film ''accessible and instructive, an astute chronicle of big-city politics and the portrait of a warrior whose passion was equaled by his generosity and good humor.'' He added: ''Mr. Penn, an actor of unmatched emotional intensity and physical discipline, outdoes himself here, playing a character different from any he has portrayed before. This is less a matter of sexuality -- there is no longer much novelty in a straight actor's 'playing gay' -- than of temperament.'' Milk was an extrovert, Mr. Scott said, whose sometimes sloppy self-presentation camouflaged an incisive mind and a ferociously stubborn will. ''All of this Mr. Penn captures effortlessly through voice and gesture,'' Mr. Scott continued, ''but what is most arresting is the sense he conveys of Milk's fundamental kindness, a personal virtue that also functions as a political principle.'' Dustin Lance Black also earned an Oscar for best screenplay. 12:30 P.M. (HBO Signature) THE BANGER SISTERS (2002) Susan Sarandon plays Lavinia, a conservative Phoenix housewife whose carefully camouflaged past as a '70s rock groupie threatens to resurface when her partner in backstage adventure, Suzette (Goldie Hawn), unexpectedly shows up for a visit, and a handout. Geoffrey Rush, in town to kill his father, is the failed screenwriter who hasn't had sex in a decade. But Suzette will take care of that. ''For all the charm effused by its stars, 'The Banger Sisters,' written and directed by Bob Dolman, emerges as a pallid, unconvincing pipe dream,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The Times. ''I've known several superannuated groupies, and in real life they are much more like Patsy and Edina, the bitter, self-deluded harpies of the British series 'Absolutely Fabulous,' than Ms. Hawn's ageless, spiritually unsullied evangelist of hip.''"

Like everyone in journalism, I had been focused on the debt ceiling debates, but what I saw in Yamhill was a different economic scourge: unemployment. It really puzzles me that 25 million Americans could be unemployed or under-employed, and yet the issue has never really gotten much traction. In the last month or two, it has gained more visibility and President Obama says he is pivoting to jobs -- but none of the proposals on the agenda come close to matching the severity of the unemployment picture."

Mrs. Huntington was born on October 2, 1938 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She graduated from Raven Hill Academy in Philadelphia, and attended Manhattanville College for two years before transferring to and graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1960 with a B.A. in History. It was at the University of Pennsylvania that Mrs. Huntington met her devoted husband of fifty years, Robert H. Huntington, who she married in 1960. Mr. Huntington passed away in 2010 after a long illness. Shortly after marrying, they moved to Rye, New York, where she remained active in community and church affairs over the next forty years. Among other activities, she served on the Board of Directors of Samaritan Counseling Center (formerly Sound Shore Counseling Center), and was a founding member of the Rye Youth Council Outreach Program. She was the Treasurer and later three-term President of the 26th Twig, an organization devoted to raising funds for United Hospital in Port Chester. Mrs. Huntington later served on the Board of Directors for United Hospital. She was also an active member of the Rye Garden Club and its Conservation Committee. Mrs. Huntington was also an active member of the Church of the Resurrection in Rye, where she taught religious education for many years, and served as a Eucharistic Minister. She later was instrumental in forming the Interfaith Church Group or ""ICARE,"" an organization devoted to training individuals to assist parishioners in need. Mrs. Huntington was a longtime member of the Apawamis Club in Rye, New York, where she played competitive tennis and golf for many years, and later served as the Chairwoman of the Women's Golf Program. She is survived and will be missed by her three children: Robert H. Huntington III and his wife Katherine of New York City; Thomas Andrew Huntington and his wife Melissa of Oakland, California; and Betsy Gallagher and her husband Jim of Rye; along with five grandchildren, Amanda and John Huntington, Ben Huntington, and Emma and Georgia Gallagher. Ellie was loved and respected by her family and large circle of devoted friends. Her humor, great stories and competitive fire will be sorely missed. The family will receive friends at the Graham Funeral Home, 1036 Boston Post Road, Rye, NY 10580 on Tuesday from 5pm to 8pm. A mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Wednesday, August 31 at 11:00am at The Church of the Resurrection in Rye.

''For a while 'Conviction,' based on the true story of a New England woman's long struggle to win freedom for her imprisoned brother, feels as if it just might escape the stifling conventions of the crusader-for-justice melodrama,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this film from Tony Goldwyn. But soon enough the movie ''goes into lockdown, as the talents of a number of superb actors are stifled by an airless, by-the-numbers story,'' he writes, adding: ''The intriguing question of Kenny's character -- not his guilt or innocence, but the quicksilver temperament that makes both seem plausible -- fades as the story of Betty Anne's hard work and sacrifice gains momentum. And Ms. Swank's performance shrinks in scope as her character's monomaniacal devotion to freeing Kenny takes over the movie.'' Ultimately, '' 'Conviction' tells a great story,'' Mr. Scott added.

2011-08-28T00:00:00Z,"THERE was a time -- say, from the rise of Grandmaster Flash in the 1970s to the fall of the 42nd Street grindhouse in the '90s -- when a singular trend in portrait photography took root in New York, from Times Square to Harlem to Coney Island. Street photographers, usually wielding Polaroid cameras, set up backdrops airbrushed onto bedsheets, hung those sheets from the gates of shuttered storefronts and invited passers-by to pose in front of them in exchange for small donations. The backdrops, to exercise the imagination slightly, were an urban version of medieval unicorn tapestries, evoking icons like gleaming BMWs or wads of $1,000 bills accompanied by slogans like ''Living Large'' or ''I Wanna Sex You Up.'' For the photographers who used them, like Louis Mendes (''Shaft with a camera,'' a Facebook fan once called him), the backdrops were an easy way to make a little ''coffee money,'' as he put it. For the clientele, they were both souvenirs from a night on the town and pictorial proof of personality. That painted Tweety bird? That's so me, man; that's what I'm about."

Instead, he decided to return to college, giving himself another chance to win the Heisman Trophy and possibly a national title. Luck, who is a redshirt junior but a senior academically, enters this season on top of the college football world. Now he must figure out how to stay there, how to prepare for his pro career, and how to savor a year that should be a highlight in the life of any soon-to-be 22-year-old. There is precedent for him to consider. A small number of star college quarterbacks in recent years also returned for their senior years. With Luck in mind, they and those close to them shared the reasons behind their decisions and what they learned from the experience."

John graduated cum laude with a BA in Religion from Amherst College in 1963, a PhD in Economics and International Relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, in 1974 and a Masters in Public Health from Harvard University in 1980. He worked for the Ford Foundation from 1967-1978 on economic development, living in Indonesia from 1967-1971 until he was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease and began hemodialysis at age 30. Kidney failure transformed John's and his family's lives. In the early 1970s, he and his family were among the first to perform self-dialysis at home. John became a nationally recognized authority on hemodialysis, patient quality of life and organ donation, and an award-winning consultant to the medical profession, patient and research organizations and government public policy panels. He served on many national boards, including the National Kidney Foundation, the United Network for Organ Sharing, the American Kidney Fund and the American Association of Kidney Patients, of which he was president for four years. He also served on various task forces for the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Few, if any, institutions concerned with kidney or organ failure did not benefit from John's leadership and guidance. John's first wife, Mary Misch Newmann, preceded him in death by 19 days. They are survived by their daughters, Sara (Doug Sovern), of Berkeley, CA, and Emily (John Darrah), of Cambridge, MA, and their granddaughters Maxine and Sadie Newmann Darrah. John is survived by his life partner for the last two decades, Judy Solomon Engelberg of Chevy Chase, MD, with whom he enjoyed humor, travel, music, art and their close inter-connected families. John is also survived by his second wife, Lisa Aronson Newmann of Housatonic, MA, and by his loving brothers, Fred (Carolyn Hegeler) of Madison, WI and Bill (Rachel) of Olympia, WA. The three brothers were known in the family for their zany antics and for always ""sticking together."" When he was 11 years old, John met and played piano with Louis Armstrong in Chicago, beginning a cherished friendship that lasted until Armstrong's death in 1971. John's devotion to Satchmo's music continued until the last moments of his own life. As Louis once said, ""what we play is life"" and what a wonderful life John had. ""We'll keep it rolling for you."" A celebration of John's life will be held October 29 at 3pm at the Cambridge Friends Meeting House in Cambridge, MA. Donations in John's memory may be made to the ""John Newmann Memorial Fund"" at the American Association of Kidney Patients (www.aakp.org) 800-749-2257 and the Louis Armstrong House Museum: www.louisarmstronghouse.org 718-478-8274."

From presidential appearances to Union rallies, everyone was singing -- usually emotional versions of ''Yankee Doodle'' or ''Hail, Columbia'' or ''The Star-Spangled Banner.'' It's forgotten today, but in 1861 America didn't have an official national anthem; each of those songs functioned more or less informally as the nation's rallying cry at some point in its history. The problem was, few could agree which one, if any, was popular enough to stand as the country's official song -- at a time when more and more people thought it needed one. In response, a group of Manhattan power brokers -- lawyers, politicians, businessmen, scholars and a former senator and New York governor -- who called themselves the National Hymn Committee, decided to find a new official anthem."

Predeceased by his sister, Susan Stothers Nims. Graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, Princeton University and Harvard University. Richard Stothers walked into the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in June 1961, a first-year graduate student looking for a summer job, carrying a one-paragraph note from a professor recommending him simply as a ""very good man"". Within two years, he published four papers in the most prestigious journal, the Astrophysical Journal, received his Ph.D. from Harvard and became a permanent staff member of the Goddard Institute, where he worked the rest of his life. He became a world expert on the structure of stars, as well as their origin and evolution. It was Dr. Stothers' work and technical advice that stimulated Dr. Robert Jastrow, the founding director of the Goddard Institute, to write his famous book, Red Giants and White Dwarfs. Dr. Stothers was a scholar of classical mold, able to read original papers in several languages. He published almost 200 papers, mostly in astrophysics and solar physics.

My date and I stood in line for three hours to get in. Many people were deeply frightened. I remember some girls weeping quietly. A few rushed out. When each of the demon scenes was over, there was a collective sense of relief and some nervous laughter, mainly at ourselves. The audience cheered at the arrival of the elderly exorcist, Father Merrin, but left the theater quietly at the end.''"

2011-08-28T00:00:00Z,"RIEHM--John (Jack) Wilk, longtime resident of Bronxville, New York, died 26 August 2011, of natural causes at his home in Tucson, Arizona. Born in 1920 in Peoria, Illinois, to John and Martha Riehm. He was awarded a Bachelor of Science with Honors from Bradley University. With the outbreak of World War II, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and married the love of his life Doris Pancratz. After the war, he completed his Juris Doctorate at the University of Michigan and accepted a position with the New York law firm Cravath, Swain and Moore. He left New York for Dallas, Texas, and the SMU School of Law where he started as an Associate Professor and rose to Dean of the Law School. As Dean, he initiated programs that would lead to a Doctor of Science Law degree, Comparative Law for Latin American lawyers and the creation of the Southwest Graduate School of Banking at SMU. He was responsible for the move of the Journal of Aviation Law and Commerce to the SMU Law School. He served several terms of office with the Southwestern Legal Foundation. In 1963, he moved back to New York as Director and Executive Vice-President of Matthew Bender Law Publishing and then to Thomas J. Lipton as Secretary and General Counsel. He retired from Lipton as Executive Vice-President. Not one to really retire, he began the venture capital business R&G Ventures, Inc. He served on the Boards of Lipton, Unilever, US Life Corporation, and the Board of Montefiore Medical Center, part of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He was a Director of US Life Insurance Company and President of Freedom House. John's interest in law, economics and aviation continued after his retirement. He was a voracious reader, four newspapers a day as well as best sellers. His favorite activity was the forty summers he spent at the ranch, Spear-O-Wigwam, in the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming. His sweet tooth was with him to the end. He is survived by his wife of 70 years, Doris Riehm, his three daughters, Susan Riehm Braden of San Marcos, Texas, Sandra Riehm Shepard and husband Joe of Tyler, Texas, Elizabeth Ganin and husband Bruce of Tucson, Arizona, son John Riehm III of Tucson, Arizona, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

2011-08-28T00:00:00Z,"CECIL BEATON produced a torrent of work, not unlike Andy Warhol and Takashi Murakami, who collaborated with Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton. In a new book, ''Cecil Beaton: The New York Years,'' Donald Albrecht suggests that his methods of working in a variety of media, his blurring of the lines between art and commerce, and his promotional skills made him ''remarkably prescient.'' Certainly Beaton was able to move from one medium to another: fashion photography, portraiture, illustration, costume and set design. I'm sure many designers today wish they could be liberated from their studio bunkers; the demands of work keep them pinned down like enemy fire. A few have time to express themselves in other media (and I don't mean HSN), but most have to do their dreaming with pins and fabric and mood boards. It's not so bad."

Bowen Loftin, the president of Texas A&M, essentially said the Aggies were leaving, and there was nothing the Big 12 could do to keep them, according to a person with firsthand knowledge of the call. Multiple presidents on the call used the words ''amicable divorce'' when discussing the Aggies' departure. That would seem to suggest that there will not be any legal wrangling. Paramount in negotiations to allow Texas A&M to leave the conference is the university's buyout, which is estimated in the $15 million range. While no timetable was discussed, the feeling on the call was that the Aggies' departure could happen as soon as the end of next week."

But has the world ever seen as probing a work of zoological investigative reporting as ''Unlikely Friendships: 47 Remarkable Stories From the Animal Kingdom''? Jennifer S. Holland's irresistible volume, No. 7 in its sixth week on the paperback nonfiction list, features heartwarming stories of interspecies love and adorable photographs that are heart-stopping in more than one sense. Everything seems copacetic between the nearsighted deer and the black poodle shown canoodling on a bed in Canal Fulton, Ohio, but one wonders about the long-term stability of the relationship between the polar bear and the sled dog shown cavorting in the Canadian Arctic, not to mention the lioness and baby oryx shown strolling together in Kenya's Samburu National Reserve. Might a sequel resemble a slasher movie more than an Animal Planet special? Holland quotes a conservationist speculating that the lioness (nicknamed Kamunyak, or ''Blessed One,'' in tribute to her ''almost biblical'' behavior), who serially adopted five more baby oryxes after the first one was devoured by a male lion, may have lost her pride at a critical moment in her development, thus fueling her ''quirky obsession.'' ''Kamunyak and the calf are a living paradox,'' the conservationist said. ''Their intimacy defies the laws of nature.''"

The seller was Scott A.

Mr. Bommer, the founder of SAB Capital Management, paid $28.5 million for the Ritz Carlton condo in July 2008.

2011-08-28T00:00:00Z,"Last week's Metropolitan cover article, ''The High Price of Looking Like a Woman,'' by Laura Rena Murray, spurred outrage and debate online about the widespread use of silicone injections by transgender women -- many of whom turn to so-called pumpers who practice illegally and often end up disfiguring their clients' bodies. Following are excerpts from the discussion on NYTimes.com. Readers also reacted to Neil Genzlinger's City Critic column about New York practices he would like to see ticketed. This was heartbreaking. I hope that an investigation and crackdown is launched to prosecute these hack ''doctors.'' It is so wrong, on every level."

Predeceased by his sister, Susan Stothers Nims. Graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, Princeton University and Harvard University. Richard Stothers walked into the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in June 1961, a first-year graduate student looking for a summer job, carrying a one-paragraph note from a professor recommending him simply as a ""very good man"". Within two years, he published four papers in the most prestigious journal, the Astrophysical Journal, received his Ph.D. from Harvard and became a permanent staff member of the Goddard Institute, where he worked the rest of his life. He became a world expert on the structure of stars, as well as their origin and evolution. It was Dr. Stothers' work and technical advice that stimulated Dr. Robert Jastrow, the founding director of the Goddard Institute, to write his famous book, Red Giants and White Dwarfs. Dr. Stothers was a scholar of classical mold, able to read original papers in several languages. He published almost 200 papers, mostly in astrophysics and solar physics. In the last two decades of his life he spent much of his time on climate science, especially investigating ancient writings to extract information on climate change throughout recorded history.

2011-08-28T00:00:00Z,"NEWMANN--John M.,PhD 70, died peacefully of natural causes in Oakland, CA on August 12, surrounded by his loving family. Born July 11, 1941 in Highland Park, IL, the second son of Harold and Maxine Newmann, John will be remembered for his remarkable resilience, his ability to find humor in any situation, his staunch advocacy for patients with renal and organ failure, his ardent passion for Louis Armstrong and jazz, and his love and complete devotion to his adoring family and many lifelong friends. John graduated cum laude with a BA in Religion from Amherst College in 1963, a PhD in Economics and International Relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, in 1974 and a Masters in Public Health from Harvard University in 1980. He worked for the Ford Foundation from 1967-1978 on economic development, living in Indonesia from 1967-1971 until he was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease and began hemodialysis at age 30. Kidney failure transformed John's and his family's lives. In the early 1970s, he and his family were among the first to perform self-dialysis at home. John became a nationally recognized authority on hemodialysis, patient quality of life and organ donation, and an award-winning consultant to the medical profession, patient and research organizations and government public policy panels. He served on many national boards, including the National Kidney Foundation, the United Network for Organ Sharing, the American Kidney Fund and the American Association of Kidney Patients, of which he was president for four years. He also served on various task forces for the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Few, if any, institutions concerned with kidney or organ failure did not benefit from John's leadership and guidance. John's first wife, Mary Misch Newmann, preceded him in death by 19 days. They are survived by their daughters, Sara (Doug Sovern), of Berkeley, CA, and Emily (John Darrah), of Cambridge, MA, and their granddaughters Maxine and Sadie Newmann Darrah. John is survived by his life partner for the last two decades, Judy Solomon Engelberg of Chevy Chase, MD, with whom he enjoyed humor, travel, music, art and their close inter-connected families. John is also survived by his second wife, Lisa Aronson Newmann of Housatonic, MA, and by his loving brothers, Fred (Carolyn Hegeler) of Madison, WI and Bill (Rachel) of Olympia, WA. The three brothers were known in the family for their zany antics and for always ""sticking together."" When he was 11 years old, John met and played piano with Louis Armstrong in Chicago, beginning a cherished friendship that lasted until Armstrong's death in 1971. John's devotion to Satchmo's music continued until the last moments of his own life. As Louis once said, ""what we play is life"" and what a wonderful life John had. ""We'll keep it rolling for you."" A celebration of John's life will be held October 29 at 3pm at the Cambridge Friends Meeting House in Cambridge, MA. Donations in John's memory may be made to the ""John Newmann Memorial Fund"" at the American Association of Kidney Patients (www.aakp.org) 800-749-2257 and the Louis Armstrong House Museum: www.louisarmstronghouse.org 718-478-8274."

The Blue Jays were tied with the Tigers for the American League East lead, and Flanagan pitched 11 innings of a 12-inning loss in Detroit. Since that day, only one pitcher has ever worked more innings in a game: Andy Hawkins for the Yankees on July 6, 1990, in the first game of a doubleheader against Minnesota. Hawkins pitched 112/3 innings but gave up two runs and lost, 2-0. In his previous start, Hawkins had thrown an eight-inning no-hitter in Chicago and lost, 4-0. Neither feat -- allowing four runs in a no-hitter, or pitching into the 12th inning of a game -- seems likely to be repeated."

(Showtime) THE GHOST WRITER (2010) In this moody tale from Roman Polanski, Ewan McGregor is ''at his ingénue best'' as a writer for hire, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. His job is to clean up the unfinished memoir of Adam Lang, a former British prime minister played by ''a superb Pierce Brosnan,'' after the previous writer has washed up on an American beach. Olivia Williams is Lang's wife, a brainy beauty with secrets. And the Langs' marital relationship is meant to evoke that of Cherie Booth and Tony Blair. Mr. Polanski delivers ''this pulpy fun at such a high level that 'The Ghost Writer' is irresistible, no matter how obvious the twists,'' Ms. Dargis added. ''The pleasures of a well-directed movie should never be underestimated.''"
2011-08-28T00:00:00Z,"NEWMANN--John M.,PhD 70, died peacefully of natural causes in Oakland, CA on August 12, surrounded by his loving family. Born July 11, 1941 in Highland Park, IL, the second son of Harold and Maxine Newmann, John will be remembered for his remarkable resilience, his ability to find humor in any situation, his staunch advocacy for patients with renal and organ failure, his ardent passion for Louis Armstrong and jazz, and his love and complete devotion to his adoring family and many lifelong friends. John graduated cum laude with a BA in Religion from Amherst College in 1963, a PhD in Economics and International Relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, in 1974 and a Masters in Public Health from Harvard University in 1980. He worked for the Ford Foundation from 1967-1978 on economic development, living in Indonesia from 1967-1971 until he was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease and began hemodialysis at age 30. Kidney failure transformed John's and his family's lives. In the early 1970s, he and his family were among the first to perform self-dialysis at home. John became a nationally recognized authority on hemodialysis, patient quality of life and organ donation, and an award-winning consultant to the medical profession, patient and research organizations and government public policy panels. He served on many national boards, including the National Kidney Foundation, the United Network for Organ Sharing, the American Kidney Fund and the American Association of Kidney Patients, of which he was president for four years. He also served on various task forces for the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Few, if any, institutions concerned with kidney or organ failure did not benefit from John's leadership and guidance. John's first wife, Mary Misch Newmann, preceded him in death by 19 days. They are survived by their daughters, Sara (Doug Sovern), of Berkeley, CA, and Emily (John Darrah), of Cambridge, MA, and their granddaughters Maxine and Sadie Newmann Darrah. John is survived by his life partner for the last two decades, Judy Solomon Engelberg of Chevy Chase, MD, with whom he enjoyed humor, travel, music, art and their close inter-connected families. John is also survived by his second wife, Lisa Aronson Newmann of Housatonic, MA, and by his loving brothers, Fred (Carolyn Hegeler) of Madison, WI and Bill (Rachel) of Olympia, WA. The three brothers were known in the family for their zany antics and for always ""sticking together."" When he was 11 years old, John met and played piano with Louis Armstrong in Chicago, beginning a cherished friendship that lasted until Armstrong's death in 1971. John's devotion to Satchmo's music continued until the last moments of his own life. As Louis once said, ""what we play is life"" and what a wonderful life John had. ""We'll keep it rolling for you."" A celebration of John's life will be held October 29 at 3pm at the Cambridge Friends Meeting House in Cambridge, MA. Donations in John's memory may be made to the ""John Newmann Memorial Fund"" at the American Association of Kidney Patients (www.aakp.org) 800-749-2257 and the Louis Armstrong House Museum: www.louisarmstronghouse.org 718-478-8274."

Survived by his brother, Hedley Stothers, his nephews Josh Nims, Seth Nims and Hedley Stothers III, and his nieces Ruth Stothers Dolan and Sarah Stothers. Predeceased by his sister, Susan Stothers Nims. Graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, Princeton University and Harvard University. Richard Stothers walked into the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in June 1961, a first-year graduate student looking for a summer job, carrying a one-paragraph note from a professor recommending him simply as a ""very good man"". Within two years, he published four papers in the most prestigious journal, the Astrophysical Journal, received his Ph.D. from Harvard and became a permanent staff member of the Goddard Institute, where he worked the rest of his life. He became a world expert on the structure of stars, as well as their origin and evolution. It was Dr. Stothers' work and technical advice that stimulated Dr. Robert Jastrow, the founding director of the Goddard Institute, to write his famous book, Red Giants and White Dwarfs. Dr. Stothers was a scholar of classical mold, able to read original papers in several languages. He published almost 200 papers, mostly in astrophysics and solar physics. In the last two decades of his life he spent much of his time on climate science, especially investigating ancient writings to extract information on climate change throughout recorded history.

''It speaks to that part of us that longs for something real, that wants to pick up some rocks, logs, meat and cook over a fire,'' he said. The menu, by the chef Ignacio Mattos, formerly of Il Buco, features succulent fall-off-the-bone pig's tail, a bright consommé made with herbs from the restaurant's roof garden, a cashew-dressed vegansalad that tastes curiously like a classic Caesar, and steak served with slim re-imagined potato skins. ''This is the most fun I've had in nine years,'' Mr. Somer said. ''We're trying things and making things. We just want to lose the fear, throw a little caution to the wind, dance badly and have a blast.'' At 348 Wythe Street. Go to isa.gg. KEN MILLER"

The weather was humid but mild; there were people buying gelato, tourists taking photos of the plaza and music lovers heading into Avery Fisher Hall for what was supposed to have been the next-to-last performance of this summer's Mostly Mozart Festival, with Louis Langrée, the festival's music director, conducting the festival orchestra in works by Stravinsky, Schubert and Mozart. Earlier on Friday the announcement had come that the final performance, on Saturday night (a repeat of Friday's program), had been canceled in anticipation of the storm and the shutdown of the public transit system. But the mood inside the hall was unusually festive."

They had been engaged in an epic court battle over custody of their young daughter, and related financial matters. The fight involved claims of abuse by Mr. Gibson and of extortion by Ms. Grigorieva. But the court said there is a deal between the two, the terms of which will be reviewed at a hearing scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Wednesday in the courtroom of Judge Peter D. Lichtman. The court hears custody issues behind closed doors.

He was soaking wet, barely able to hear -- and he was beaming. ''We haven't missed a live shot in three hours!'' he exclaimed while trying to stand up on the battered beach here in his seventh hour of live television reporting. A minute later, he was back on the Weather Channel, where he would stay for a total of 15 hours on Saturday, seeing, feeling and tasting the storm several times each hour as a surrogate for viewers and a guide for evacuees."

2011-08-29T00:00:00Z,"EAGER to throw off my nerdy past and reinvent myself at college, I wrote ''party animal'' on my roommate application form where it asked incoming freshmen whether they wanted to bunk with a smoker or a non-smoker. When I told my mother about this later, she laughed and bought me a T-shirt that sported the image of Spuds MacKenzie, the 1980s Budweiser beer mascot, under the words ''the original party animal.'' I ended up with Tony from Sacramento, a very quiet, Republican son of a judge. (I suppose it's good policy to separate the party animals from those who request them.) I learned to appreciate his taste in music (U2 and The Smiths, as opposed to my predilection for reggae and jazz), and we agreed to disagree about politics during the reelection campaign of Alan Cranston, then one of the most liberal members of the United States Senate. I had never met anyone like Tony. And I'm pretty sure he hadn't come across many half-Jewish, Democratic children of New York artists. We learned to get along that first year at Berkeley, and every now and then even tried on each other's values and beliefs, just to see how they fit."

Then she called the police. Her body was found about eight hours later, still inside her car, which had been swept away during a flash flood on Route 40 in Salem County. Farther north in the state, a postal inspector waded through a flooded road as he tried to get to the building in Kearny where he worked. He apparently stepped into an unseen drainage ditch and was sucked into 10 to 12 feet of flowing water, the Kearny police said. His body was found 100 yards from the entrance to the building."

''For too long the work of musicians has been used to create enormous profits for record labels, radio stations and others, without fairly distributing these profits to the artists,'' said Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, who was chairman of the committee until January. Because ''copyrights are a tool to be used by creators to earn a living from their work,'' he added, it is important to ensure ''a fair marketplace.''"

But the race was anything but a walkover for the reigning world champion and leader of the series. Vettel, who has now won seven races this season, was one of several drivers who had problems with his tires wearing out and he had dropped down the pack several times, each time having to fight back to the lead."

2011-08-29T00:00:00Z,"Bring comfortable shoes and a high threshold for frustration to the Woodshed Collective's sprawling production ''The Tenant,'' the latest in a proliferating mini-genre of immersive-spookhouse mood pieces. As they are at the higher-profile ''Sleep No More,'' audience members are set loose on multiple stories of a converted building to construct macabre narratives as they see fit, stumbling onto staged vignettes along the way. But unlike ''Sleep,'' which supplies mandatory white masks, ''The Tenant'' (originally a 1964 Roland Topor novel, but better known from Roman Polanski's 1976 film adaptation) allows lurkers and roamers to stare the performers in the face and vice versa, making the voyeuristic kick a bit more complicated. This also makes scuttling out of any given area more awkward when the scripted proceedings grow mannered or banal, but one manages. (''Why did you let them take the baby?'' was about all I heard in one room.)"

New York has thus far escaped cheating scandals like the one that exploded in Atlanta. But troubling new developments have shown weaknesses in New York's testing system that need to be fixed. The annual standardized tests given in the lower grades and the Regents examination that high school students must pass to graduate now play a crucial role in decisions about how schools are rated and how principals are evaluated. In the future, teachers will also be judged, in part, on how students perform on state tests."

The organizers of the Gwangju Design Biennale in South Korea opted for the last course when the Chinese artist and political activist Ai Weiwei was arrested in April. Luckily Mr. Ai, who is joint artistic director of the event with the South Korean architect Seung H-Sang, had finalized the plans for his contribution before his arrest.

But when Hurricane Irene finally chugged into the New York area on Sunday, it was like an overweight jogger just holding on at the end of a run. Its winds had diminished to barely hurricane strength, and the threat from its storm surge, which officials had once worried might turn Manhattan into Atlantis, was epitomized by television news reports showing small waves lapping over reporters' feet."

Predeceased by his sister, Susan Stothers Nims. Graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, Princeton University and Harvard University. Richard Stothers walked into the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in June 1961, a first-year graduate student looking for a summer job, carrying a one-paragraph note from a professor recommending him simply as a ""very good man"". Within two years, he published four papers in the most prestigious journal, the Astrophysical Journal, received his Ph.D. from Harvard and became a permanent staff member of the Goddard Institute, where he worked the rest of his life. He became a world expert on the structure of stars, as well as their origin and evolution. It was Dr. Stothers' work and technical advice that stimulated Dr. Robert Jastrow, the founding director of the Goddard Institute, to write his famous book, Red Giants and White Dwarfs. Dr. Stothers was a scholar of classical mold, able to read original papers in several languages. He published almost 200 papers, mostly in astrophysics and solar physics. In the last two decades of his life he spent much of his time on climate science, especially investigating ancient writings to extract information on climate change throughout recorded history.

Hasselbeck would handle every snap believing that no defense could stop a perfect throw, Dilfer said, and if the coverage was tight, he felt no shame dumping a pass to his running back or tight end or tossing away the ball to avoid disaster.

They are frequent guests at black-tie dinners who arrive and leave in chauffeured cars. Yet for the dozen bicycle ambassadors who were appointed in May by Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group based in New York, to educate cyclists about road rules and encourage cycling, the position seems far less elegant. On Wednesday morning, four bike ambassadors in bright blue T-shirts rode to the northeast corner of Prince and Lafayette Streets in Manhattan."
2011-08-29T00:00:00Z,"LENOX, Mass. -- On Friday evening a hurricane raged toward the Atlantic coast. At the same time one roared onstage here at the Tanglewood Festival, threatening the lives of the inhabitants of Catfish Row, the South Carolina ghetto that is the setting of George Gershwin's opera ''Porgy and Bess.'' Or rather, was supposed to roar. Like the performance as a whole, the storm in this ''Porgy'' passed pleasantly and picturesquely. There wasn't anything really wrong with it, but neither was there anything especially gripping or moving. It was hard to tell on Friday how the work -- at 76, an accepted classic -- still gets people so riled up."

2011-08-29T00:00:00Z,"The fuzzy yellow ball hurtles through the air at top speed, so you move your feet and get your racket back. Suddenly, the ball nicks the tape at the top of the net, changing its pace, height and even direction. If this happened in the middle of a point, the player would have to adjust and keep playing. But in one of tennis's oddest quirks, the rule is different during a serve that is good, when the action stops and the server has to try again."

The Super PAC, which by law is supposed to be strictly independent of the Romney campaign, happened to have been formed by some of his closest political aides so they can drum up unlimited donations from individuals and corporations. But, for the life of us, we can't figure out what's independent about it."

As my fly, a No. 12 Cascade with double hooks, swung across the current, salmon rolled in the river before me, at once beguiling and maddening. I took two steps downstream and prepared to cast again, but my concentration was broken by a series of staccato beeps from a procession of cars passing over Upper Bridge downstream. ''It's a wedding party,'' said Bryan Ward, an angling officer with Inland Fisheries Ireland. A not uncommon occurrence in downtown Ballina, where wild salmon blend seamlessly with town life."

The campaign began on Friday after Prime Minister Naoto Kan announced his resignation. It has so far failed to grip the nation, which has had five prime ministers since Junichiro Koizumi stepped down in September 2006. Most of the current candidates are relative unknowns and seem to be short on concrete ideas for directing this rudderless country."
2011-08-29T00:00:00Z,"Imagine, in your mind's eye, Serena Williams serving, facing break point. She toes the line, bounces the ball and takes a deep breath. She draws the racket back almost languidly, coils her body and vaults skyward, her legs driving the racket head at blinding speed as she clobbers an ace up the T at 120 miles an hour. The best server in the history of women's tennis pumps her left fist and yells, ''Come on!'' Now imagine an alternate version of that scene, one that might have survived if the game's early practitioners in the 19th century had not changed the rules: Williams, facing break point, bounces the ball and gently delivers a serve ... underhand. The ball arcs over a net nearly five feet high and lands in the service box of an hourglass-shaped court. A long rally of lobs and gentle spins ensues."

2011-08-29T00:00:00Z,"When you're feeding 700,000 people in two weeks, you're running a sizable food-service operation. When many of those people spend 10 or more hours on your premises, you're feeding them a lot. When half of them are New Yorkers and much of the remaining half are people well-heeled enough to spend days at a time visiting and paying for not-cheap tickets, you have to try to feed them at least decently. Welcome to the United States Open, which is obviously about tennis, not the food. Although no one comes here to eat (''Hey, let's take the 7 out to Flushing, skip the Sichuan food and eat at the Open!''), almost everyone winds up eating not a snack but a series of them, or even meals. When you consider that the Open will run two sessions almost every day for the next two weeks, and that the average stay on the grounds is six hours and the average ticket-holder visits several times, you recognize that if the food here was as bad as it is at, say, Yankee Stadium, it would be a serious turn-off."

Gulbis likes to back his opponent off the baseline with a heavy ball, then deftly play a backhand drop shot down the line for a winner. In his straight-sets victory in the Los Angeles quarterfinals, Gulbis kept Juan Martín del Potro off balance by playing smash-mouth tennis for a few shots, then pulling out ankle-breaking touch shots for winners. Gulbis is a dangerous floater."

2011-08-29T00:00:00Z,"The decision by New Jersey's Supreme Court last week to overhaul the state's rules for how judges and jurors treat evidence from police lineups could help transform the way officers conduct a central technique of police work, criminal justice experts say. In its ruling, the court strongly endorsed decades of research demonstrating that traditional eyewitness identification procedures are flawed and can send innocent people to prison. By making it easier for defendants to challenge witness evidence in criminal cases, the court for the first time attached consequences for investigators who fail to take steps to reduce the subtle pressures and influences on witnesses that can result in mistaken identifications."

2011-08-29T00:00:00Z,"Three new releases with dim box-office prospects going into the weekend were additionally pummeled by Hurricane Irene, which shuttered theaters in the all-important East Coast movie market. ''The Help'' (DreamWorks Studios) repeated as No. 1 for a third weekend, taking in an estimated $14.3 million for a new domestic total of $96.6 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. ''Colombiana'' (TriStar) performed the best of the three newcomers, placing second with about $10 million in ticket sales, a total that its distributor positioned as ''better than expected.'' Third place went to ''Don't Be Afraid of the Dark,'' which took in about $8.7 million; Film District notably marketed this thriller on the back of Guillermo del Toro, one of its writers and producers (and a type of fanboy pied piper for his ''Hellboy'' series.) ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes'' (20th Century Fox) was fourth with ticket sales of about $8.6 million. ''Our Idiot Brother,'' a quirky comedy starring Paul Rudd, opened in fifth place, taking in about $6.7 million for the Weinstein Company. The silver lining for the weekend, if there is any, involves the vicious blame game that breaks out in Hollywood when movies wilt at the box office. Now the studio executives, producers, writers, actors and agents involved will spend Monday pointing at Irene instead of at one another."

Twisted metal rods hung down amid the debris in the darkened ground floor, piles of glass shards lay about the grounds and parking lot, and virtually every window in the front of the sprawling four-story building had been blasted out.

Doing it this way meant we didn't have to ask Samberg to play all those blurry folks in the stands. And that left him more time to personify tennis greatness, as seen in the outtake at bottom."

With color-block graphics and razor-sharp wit, Muratyan presents the iconography of each city in dueling juxtaposition that becomes a running commentary on transcontinental difference. The diptychs can be so sly that the mere upward slope of a line - as in the case of Jean-Luc Godard's square eyeglasses beside Woody Allen's arched, angst-ridden pair - is enough to set two greats apart. More than two and a half million hits later, Muratyan's site, begun last October, has spawned an exhibit and sale at the shop Colette, in Paris, of Muratyan's most popular images in limited-edition prints, including the pitting of macarons against cupcakes and the dueling hairdos of Sonia Rykiel and Anna Wintour.

Initiated by an executive order issued by President John F. Kennedy, the Peace Corps Act was passed in 1961, instituting an “army” of volunteers to aid those in developing countries. Sensing an opportunity right in line with SeaVees’s revisionist design philosophy and midcentury aesthetic, Tiller and his business partner, Derek Galkin, began sifting through old photos of Peace Corps volunteers. On their feet? Narrow plimsolls, a common canvas and rubber sneaker for that era. “The idea was to go back in time, reimagine these shoes and hopefully make them cooler,” Tiller said. The resulting slim-lined sneaker in salt-washed canvas has a contrast suede stripe around its rims and a distinct vintage look.

Created by Ms. Saunders, the original ''Absolutely Fabulous'' - ''Abfab'' to its friends - chronicled a public-relations executive (Edina) and a magazine editor (Patsy) whose efforts to remain hip and find sex in the city would leave Carrie Bradshaw utterly appalled. Over five seasons and various specials that were shown in Britain between 1992 and 2004 (and on American television on Comedy Central and Logo), the ladies drank and drugged their way through London and experienced the occasional adverse reaction to eating solid food."

2011-08-30T00:00:00Z,"CULLMAN--Edgar M. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of The Mount Sinai Medical Center mourn the passing of Edgar M. Cullman, a true philanthropist whose more than 50 years of service on The Mount Sinai Boards of Trustees were marked by his integrity, conviction, and generosity. His family's legacy of leadership at Mount Sinai began with the Hospital's founding in 1852, and Edgar joined the Board of the Mount Sinai Hospital School of Nursing in 1950. His work in that role inspired in him a lifelong advocacy for nursing and patient care, interests which he passionately championed upon joining the Mount Sinai Board of Trustees in 1957. Edgar remained deeply involved throughout his decades of service, speaking often to the doctors and nurses to express his appreciation and seek their insights to improve patient care. He applied that learning to the founding of The Joseph F. Cullman Jr. Institute for Patient Care, established by him and his brothers Lewis B. Cullman and Joseph F. Cullman 3rd in memory of their father. Along with his equally dedicated wife Louise, Edgar was a reliable benefactor who made many substantial gifts over the years that were instrumental in securing Mount Sinai's financial future and excellence. His spirit of commitment survives him through our cherished partnership with Louise and his children, Lucy Cullman Danziger and Boards of Trustees members Edgar M. Cullman Jr. and Susan R. Cullman. In recognition of the staunch commitment, extraordinary contributions, and devoted generosity of Edgar and the entire Cullman family, Mount Sinai will honor the Cullmans during the Noble Deeds Society Dinner in October. We dearly wish Edgar could have been there to hear how much his service has meant to us. On behalf of Mount Sinai, we extend our heartfelt condolences to Louise, Lucy, Edgar Jr., Susan, his brother Lewis and the entire Cullman family. Peter W. May, Chairman, Boards of Trustees,The Mount Sinai Medical Center Kenneth L. Davis, MD, President and CEO, The Mount Sinai Medical Center"

2011-08-30T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (13) ARMADILLO (2011) Janus Metz follows a platoon of Danish soldiers through Helmand Province in Afghanistan in a film that has a lot in common with ''Restrepo,'' the war documentary by Sebastian Junger and Tim Hetherington, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. As in ''Restrepo,'' he said, the men's ''sincere devotion to duty, and their interest in making a difference in an unfortunate part of the world, is challenged by a pervasive sense of the enterprise's difficulty.'' Despite enormous technological advantages, ''the mutual incomprehension of these men and the Afghans they're helping -- who may or may not be the same people they're fighting -- seems almost intractable. And the soldiers' frustration proves explosive.'' An intense firefight and its bloody aftermath turns the film ''into a queasy ethical puzzle,'' Mr. Scott said. ''What happens is shocking, and yet it also seems, especially to the soldiers, completely logical and acceptable. It is certainly possible to believe otherwise, but the achievement of this film is to forestall and complicate easy judgment. You emerge shaken and bothered, which may sound like a reason not to see the movie. It is actually the opposite.'' 2:20 P.M. (Cinemax) THE INFORMANT! (2009) In Steven Soderbergh's retelling of a real-life whodunit reported in a book (and for The New York Times) by Kurt Eichenwald, Matt Damon, above, adds some pounds and a prosthetic nose to play Mark Whitacre, a biochemist and Archer Daniels Midland executive who informs on his company's involvement in a global price-fixing scheme. Scott Bakula and Joel McHale are the F.B.I. agents who become so protective of Whitacre that they carry around a picture of his family after wiring up his body and briefcase. ''Like all of Mr. Soderbergh's movies, this one can be appreciated on purely formal terms, for the clarity of its images and the economy of the storytelling,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times. ''But it is Mr. Soderbergh's insistence on seeing the A.D.M. scandal as a collective tragedy rather than as another white-collar crime that gives the movie force, resonance, feeling. In the face of such corruption perhaps only laughter will do: after all, for a while now the joke has most definitely been on us.''"

He moved to Paris in 1949 and studied painting at the Academie Julian. In 1951 he was awarded a Fulbright Act grant for a year's study in India, and thereafter traveled extensively throughout Southeast Asia and Japan, studying and collecting art. Returning to New York in the mid-1950s, he was briefly a student of the abstract expressionist painter Robert Motherwell at Hunter College, and took classes at the Art Students League. He turned away from avant-garde movements in his own art, preferring representational painting, which was his lifelong passion. He exhibited his impressionistic portraits, interiors, and especially closely observed landscapes and still lifes in galleries and museums in California, New Jersey, and New York. A member of United Scenic Artists union, he worked for most of his career as a set painter for NBC Studios and, later, Lincoln Scenic Studios, in New York. In 1956 he married Mahbubeh Mahboubian, an Iranian student at the Manhattan School of Music, who survives him, along with three daughters, Pari Stave of Cranbury, Shirin Stave-Matias of Tomar, Portugal, and Kian Stave of New York; a son-in-law, Fausto Matias; and three grandchildren."

I had disputed this point, noting that Schaeffer only urged Christians to consider acts of non-violent civil disobedience against the post-Roe abortion regime (offering examples like the non-payment of taxes and public sit-ins), while explicitly warning his readers against an ""overreaction [that] crosses the line from force to violence.""

Cullman, a true philanthropist whose more than 50 years of service on The Mount Sinai Boards of Trustees were marked by his integrity, conviction, and generosity. His family's legacy of leadership at Mount Sinai began with the Hospital's founding in 1852, and Edgar joined the Board of the Mount Sinai Hospital School of Nursing in 1950. His work in that role inspired in him a lifelong advocacy for nursing and patient care, interests which he passionately championed upon joining the Mount Sinai Board of Trustees in 1957. Edgar remained deeply involved throughout his decades of service, speaking often to the doctors and nurses to express his appreciation and seek their insights to improve patient care. He applied that learning to the founding of The Joseph F. Cullman Jr. Institute for Patient Care, established by him and his brothers Lewis B. Cullman and Joseph F. Cullman 3rd in memory of their father. Along with his equally dedicated wife Louise, Edgar was a reliable benefactor who made many substantial gifts over the years that were instrumental in securing Mount Sinai's financial future and excellence. His spirit of commitment survives him through our cherished partnership with Louise and his children, Lucy Cullman Danziger and Boards of Trustees members Edgar M. Cullman Jr. and Susan R. Cullman. In recognition of the staunch commitment, extraordinary contributions, and devoted generosity of Edgar and the entire Cullman family, Mount Sinai will honor the Cullmans during the Noble Deeds Society Dinner in October. We dearly wish Edgar could have been there to hear how much his service has meant to us. On behalf of Mount Sinai, we extend our heartfelt condolences to Louise, Lucy, Edgar Jr., Susan, his brother Lewis and the entire Cullman family. Peter W. May, Chairman, Boards of Trustees,The Mount Sinai Medical Center Kenneth L. Davis, MD, President and CEO, The Mount Sinai Medical Center"

But when the same thing happens under a Democratic administration, it's depressing. With little or no public input, policies that benefit corporations regardless of the consequences continue to be enacted. No wonder an April 2010 poll from the Pew Research Center found that about only 20 percent of Americans have faith in the government (it's one thing upon which the left and right and maybe even the center agree). But maybe this is nothing new: as Glenda Farrell, as Genevieve ''Gen'' Larkin, put it in ''Gold Diggers of 1937,'' ''It's so hard to be good under the capitalistic system.''"

The name of the tabloid newspaper Mr. Morgan edited from 1995 to 2004 is The Daily Mirror, not The Mirror. The BBC reported that it had uncovered records showing that The Daily Mirror and a sister newspaper, The Sunday Mirror -- not the Trinity Mirror group, their parent company -- used private investigators 230 times during a two-year period in the late 1990s. But the BBC did not say that the hiring of those investigators occurred under the ''editorship'' of Mr. Morgan. (He was editor of The Daily Mirror at the time.) The article also included incorrect details about an alleged hacking involving a phone message in 2001 from Paul McCartney to Heather Mills, who were introduced by Mr. Morgan, and who were dating at the time. In an interview Ms. Mills gave to the BBC about phone hacking, she said that a Trinity Mirror journalist -- not an executive -- called her and quoted verbatim from the voicemail. (Mr. Morgan raised questions about the veracity of her account, but in a statement issued by CNN on his behalf, he referred to the conversation she claimed to have had as involving an ''executive.'') It was the BBC that bleeped the name of that person; Ms. Mills did not omit the person's name. And it was the BBC -- not Ms. Mills -- who said that Mr. Morgan was not the person who made that call."

Optimism and possibility - the idea of the city as a laboratory where anything can happen - are two inherent qualities of L.A.'s identity that have been tied to its ability to constantly expand physically. ""Now that we no longer have that capacity,"" he wonders, ""how can we continue to produce that all-important sense of optimism so the city can continue to evolve?"""

Founded in 1985 by Ramon and Maria Cardenas, the 130-employee company offers sit-down restaurant service as well as catering and fast-food operations. Now owned by Ramon and Maria's daughter, Lucy, and her husband, Bill Coker, the 100-seat Red Iguana was facing two problems, one that most restaurateurs would die for and another that most would die to avoid. In September 2008, the restaurant was featured on the Food Network's ''Diners, Drive-ins and Dives,'' and soon there was an hour-and-a-half wait for seating almost every night. Then came word that the city would be building a light-rail line down the middle of the restaurant's street, construction that could potentially force the restaurant to close occasionally, or at least eat into its revenue by dissuading some of the 700 diners who came every day, 363 days a year."

Just 11 days before the 10th anniversary of Osama Bin Laden's attacks on New York and Washington, General Petraeus also implicitly cautioned that the United States should not abandon the troop-intensive and expensive counterinsurgency doctrine that was his hallmark when he commanded the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The general spoke as the Obama White House is shifting from a broad counterinsurgency strategy of trying to build roads, schools and good government in Afghanistan to a narrower and more secretive counterterrorism mission of hunting down terrorists."

While their finances are in flux, pet owners are less likely to splurge on toys or grooming, and fewer vacations spell empty kennels at the boarding house. In fact, prospective owners are less likely to take on the financial burden of a new dog or cat to begin with. As you can see in the video above, David Lang, owner of a Manhattan business called Pet Chauffeur, is keenly aware of these challenges. Fifteen years ago, Mr. Lang noticed that the subway system's vast ridership included few dogs. Passengers can bring small pets on board in carrying cases, but owners of larger dogs cannot travel with their pets by subway, bus or taxi. Sensing he could fill a void, he founded Pet Chauffeur, a taxi service for animals, in 1996."

This article appeared in the June issue of the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine. THE QUESTION: Seeing players curse the referee is as much a part of a game as is drinking beer in the stands. Still, under the Laws of the Game issued by FIFA, international soccer's governing body, the use of a swear word by a soccer player warrants a red card, an immediate ejection from the game. But as researchers have discovered, referees' decisions are influenced by what's happening on the field, the level of crowd noise, the timing of an incident and the location of the contest itself."

The moves came three days after Arsenal was thrashed, 8-2, by English Premier League rival Manchester United and amid mounting pressure on Manager Arsene Wenger to do something - anything - to strengthen the team.

2011-09-01T00:00:00Z,"With her long, dark braid flying through the air behind her, Christina McHale fired an ace to win her second-round match at the United States Open on Wednesday, then calmly lifted her arms to celebrate. She had just beaten the No. 8 seed, Marion Bartoli, in straight sets, 7-6(2), 6-2, in front of a packed grandstand stadium, prompting pockets of fans to leap to their feet in joy. But to her and her admirers, that upset was no surprise. It was the second time in just two weeks that McHale - a 19-year-old from Englewood Cliffs, N.J. - had defeated a top-10 player. In Cincinnati before the Open, she also beat Caroline Wozniacki, the world's No. 1. So Bartoli knew McHale would be hard to beat, just not impossible to beat, which McHale was on Wednesday."
2011-09-01T00:00:00Z,"Mirjana Lucic Vs. Francesca Schiavone Lucic turned pro at age 15, and two years later, in 1999, she reached the semifinals of Wimbledon. But then Lucic vanished from the game, dealing, she said later, with an abusive father and financial troubles. After a seven-year hiatus, Lucic returned to the main draw in 2010 and is back again this year facing a tough second-round challenge against the seventh-seeded Schiavone. On Tuesday, Lucic displayed plenty of her signature power against the qualifier Marina Erakovic, winning in a relatively error-free three sets. But Schiavone is a much tougher opponent, and a win here for Lucic would be a monumental upset. But just seeing Lucic back and playing well is reason enough to check in on this one. BERNARD TOMIC VS. MARIN CILIC As I have said in this space many times, Cilic has the game to win a Grand Slam someday -- and this match will tell us a great deal about whether that day could come a week from Sunday. Cilic had a nice win against the rising young American Ryan Harrison in the first round, and his reward is meeting a rising young Australian in the second. But Tomic is a very different player from Harrison -- one whose game is made to frustrate and annoy a player like Cilic. On his surprising run to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, Tomic displayed an astounding variety of spins, angles and slices. More impressively, the 18-year-old Tomic displayed mental toughness well beyond his years. ALIZE CORNET VS. ROBERTA VINCI Vinci is a scrappy defender who wins with quickness, a nasty slice backhand and one of the better forehands on the women's tour. At 28, she is having the best year of her career, breaking into the top 20 for the first time. This summer she has notched wins against Ana Ivanovic, Yanina Wickmayer and No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki. Vinci still has some tough matches ahead of her, but don't be surprised to see her in the fourth round or even in the quarterfinals. Her opponent is nothing short of an enigma. Two years ago, Cornet was a teenager on the rise and viewed as a can't-miss top-10 talent. After a solid 2008 season, she entered 2010 ranked 11th in the world -- and it has been downhill since. MICHAEL LLODRA VS. KEVIN ANDERSON Llodra, a 6-foot-3 Frenchman, was generally known as a doubles specialist until a few years ago, when he realized his throwback, take-no-prisoners, serve-and-volley style worked pretty well in singles, too. Since then, he has become a top-25 player, and shows no signs of slowing down at the age of 31. Anderson is a big-hitting South African who, at 25, is having the best results of his career this year. At 6-8, he is one of the tallest players on tour, and has one of its biggest serves. ARON PILHOFER"

2011-09-01T00:00:00Z,"Are basketball players the new trophy husbands? The recent marriage of Kim Kardashian, a k a the Most Famous Woman in the World, to Kris Humphries, a journeyman National Basketball Association player four years her junior, suggests something of a minor social trend. Kim joins two other prominent women who have recently become attached to N.B.A. players less accomplished (or at least less famous) than they are. One of them is, of course, her sister. The other is the $25-million woman of the tennis world. OPPOSITES ATTRACT? Kris who? That was the reaction of many of Kim Kardashian's fans when reports leaked that she was dating Kris Humphries, 26, a player on the New Jersey Nets (one who averaged just 10 points a game last year). In contrast, Kim, 30, is a pop culture phenomenon, with a net worth estimated at $35 million and an array of perfume, clothing and jewelry lines. Like her sister Kim, Khloe Kardashian, 27, is a reality-TV regular, with starring roles in three shows on E! Meanwhile, Lamar Odom, 32, despite earning two championship rings with the Los Angeles Lakers, has never quite hit the elite level in his 12-year playing career. A plot line in one episode of ''Khloe & Lamar'' was whether he would finally make the All-Star team last season. He didn't. Maria Sharapova, 24, is the highest-paid female athlete in the world, with estimated annual earnings of $25 million. She entered this week's United States Open as the No. 3 seed. Her fiancé, Sasha Vujacic, 27, earned $5.5 million last season, playing first with the Los Angeles Lakers and then the New Jersey Nets. This summer, he is playing for Anadolu Efes, in the Turkish League.; THE COURTSHIP: Kim and Kris met in late 2010, near the end of the filming of ''Kourtney & Kim Take New York.'' According to Life & Style, the new couple was first spotted at Maxwell's bar in Hoboken, N.J., where the weight-conscious Kim ''ordered a goat cheese salad and a veggie burger (hold the bun)!'' In a word: whirlwind. The two married in September 2009, after dating for one month. In a radio interview, Khloe said that she initially disliked Lamar when they met at a Los Angeles party (''I was like ew, ew, ew!''), but then she ended up giving him her phone number anyway. The couple met in the fall of 2009 at a barbecue at the home of a mutual friend. Their first public date came in November of that year when the two were spotted at a U2 concert in New Jersey. As a couple, they are hard to miss: He is 6-7 and she is 6-2.; POPPING THE QUESTION: According to People magazine, when Kim walked into her Beverly Hills home on May 18, Kris was waiting in her bedroom on bended knee with four words written in red rose petals: Will you marry me? ""OMGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!"" Kim wrote on her blog a week later. ""It's true! I couldn't be happier!'' Describing their quick marriage, Khloe said, ''Every single feeling in my body was like 'This is it.' '' Still, just in case, the couple signed a pre-nup. According Radar Online, if they split, Khloe will get $500,000 for every year they are married as well as courtside Lakers tickets for everyone in her family. Sasha proposed to Maria in October 2010 -- at the Serbian-born basketball player's home in Manhattan Beach, Calif. -- on the anniversary of the day they first met. ''He completely surprised me! I'm so lucky and very much spoiled,"" Maria told a reporter for Us magazine.; SEALED WITH A RING: Kate Middleton's massive sapphire 18-carat engagement ring is practically a dime-store novelty compared with the custom-designed, 20.5-carat Lorraine Schwartz diamond engagement ring that Kim got from Kris. Estimated value: $2 million. Khloe's engagement ring ( 12.5 carats and a reported cost of $850,000) was flashed on the covers of OK! magazine (''My Dream Wedding'') and Life & Style (''Khloe: I'm So In Love'') when the couple posed for wedding photos. A modest bauble by Kardashian standards, Maria's 8-carat diamond ring is said to be worth about $250,000. The two have yet to set a wedding date. ''We're young,'' she recently said. ''We have got many more years to spend with each other.''"

2011-09-01T00:00:00Z,"WILLIAMS--Richard. RAF Wing Commander (Ret) Richard Williams OBE died in Manchester, Vermont on August 30, 2011. He was born in Kew Gardens, England on April 8, 1918, the youngest of eight children. At the age of 8, he was sent to a Quaker boarding school, the Downes School, and subsequently attended Leighton Park College near Reading, England. In January, 1939, Richard joined the 73rd Squadron of the RAF, seeing action in the so-called ""phony war"" in France and the frantic escape from Brittany when France fell. He was reassigned to Biggin Hill, the RAF's principal fighter station defending London during the Battle of Britain. Richard was the officer in charge of England's top-secret radar ground stations along the English Channel which were a decisive factor in the Battle of Britain. In 1942, he was asked to join the Combined Munitions Assignment Board in Washington, DC as a radar specialist. For his contributions throughout the war, Richard was awarded the Order of the British Empire by Great Britain (for services to the RAF delegation and the British Air Commission) and the Legion of Merit by the United States (for services to the Combined Chiefs of Staff). Richard remained in the aeronautical industry all his life, ultimately becoming President of the overseas division of Lear Siegler. He retired to Manchester, VT in 1982 and spent winters in Beaufort, SC. An avid golfer, he served as president and chairman of the board of trustees of Ekwanok Country Club in Manchester, VT. He was a member of the U.S. Seniors, the Vermont Seniors, Callawassie Golf Club, St. George's Society, the RAF Club and was a Golden Eagle of the Wings Club. He leaves a wife of 37 years, the former Polly Simmons Barrows, of Dorset, VT, a son, David Williams of New York City, a daughter, Olwen Williams of Norton, MA, three stepdaughters, Susan Wood of Tampa, FL, Sally MacQuart of Manchester, VT and Belinda Thomas of Lexington, KY, five grandchildren, Jessica Paulus, Timothy Paulus, Eric Paulus, Conway Williams and Phoebe Williams, and numerous step-grandchildren.

You have to decide a year earlier that you want to get to the top, and then spend months persuading the Port Authority to let you do so. Then your photographer has to take two five-hour Occupational Safety and Health Administration classes devoted to construction-site safety, and a four-hour fall safety-awareness class. (Otherwise, how would you know that you really don't want to be tethered to anything that can't hold at least 10 times your weight? Because falling has the effect of making you heavier.) Finally, you have to go back-and-forth with the Port Authority for days to make sure you're on the building at the very beginning of a new two-floors-per-fortnight cycle, before the safety ""cocoon"" goes up, so your photographer can get the best possible views of the ironworkers against the skyline."

2011-09-02T00:00:00Z,"It's an event that seems to happen in the ''Star Wars'' world about as often as Wookiees celebrate Life Day, and which fans await with just as much dread. New versions of George Lucas's space-fantasy films are released, and with them come changes to the movies - alterations to audio and video, characters' actions and even dialogue that is very different from what fans remember seeing in theaters a long time ago and far, far away. So it goes for the latest editions of the six ''Star Wars'' live-action features that are being prepared for a Blu-ray home video release on Sept. 16. Previously, it was reported that the version of ''Star Wars - Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' included in this release would replace the puppet version of the Yoda character with a computer-generated creation. Then on Tuesday, an online report by Devin Faraci suggested a revelation almost as troubling as the news that Luke and Leia had been brother and sister all along: in a climactic scene from ''Return of the Jedi,'' when Darth Vader hurls the evil Emperor to his demise on the Death Star, he would now shout ''No!'' (In all previous versions of ''Jedi,'' Vader has committed this crucial deed in silence.)"

According to a casting breakdown that was circulated for the project, the musical is titled ''The Last Ship,'' and features music and lyrics by Sting and a book by Mr. Yorkey, who is directing. Though a plot summary is not provided, descriptions of the musical's characters suggest a story that is set in the 1980s in Newcastle, the northern British city where Sting was born and raised before joining his band the Police. The lead character, Gideon, is described as a man in his 30s: ''Charismatic, charming, cynical, worldly-wise; quick to buy a round or throw a fist, slow to open his heart. Grew up around the shipyards of Newcastle, got out as soon as he could, coming home to come to terms with his family, his history, and his future.''

2011-09-02T00:00:00Z,"CHRISTINA MCHALE VS. MARIA KIRILENKO On Wednesday, McHale scored one of the biggest upsets of the tournament, ousting the No. 8 seed, Marion Bartoli, in straight sets. Things don't get any easier as the 19-year-old McHale steps on court Thursday against the 25th-seeded Kirilenko. McHale's game is a bit of a throwback. She does not have the power of many of her peers, but she is a solid defender who can keep opponents off balance by constantly changing the angle, pace and trajectory of her shots. Although her ranking isn't as high as Bartoli's, Kirilenko, a Russian veteran, is in some ways a tougher matchup for McHale. She plays a similar baseline game but is much quicker around the court and will be less bothered by McHale's looping shots. ERNESTS GULBIS VS. GILLES MüLLER Gulbis, a 23-year-old Latvian, is another of those players whose results have not matched their talent. He has the kind of strokes that make you wonder how he ever loses -- a monster forehand, a laser beam of a backhand and a serve that rivals anyone's.

This week, Jack Viertel, the senior vice president of Jujamcyn Theaters, remembers the late songwriter Jerry Leiber and his role in creating a durable if highly debated stage genre, the jukebox musical. Jerry Leiber, who died on Aug. 22, has been justly celebrated in the last week as one of the fathers of rock 'n' roll. Indeed, with his writing and business partner Mike Stoller, he was a force to be reckoned with, turning out hits for Elvis, the Drifters and the Coasters, among others, and building a music publishing empire. What's been less noted is the strange and wonderful way he straddled many worlds - artist and tycoon, comedian and rock rebel, hipster, vulgarian and aesthete."

Jonah Hill is Hal, the nerdy redheaded cameraman for the local television station, whom a disconsolate Megamind transforms into Tighten, a Metro Man replacement. And Tina Fey is Roxanne Ritchie, the beautiful and fearless news reporter coveted by all three, er, men. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said, ''Typical of DreamWorks Animation toons, 'Megamind' is crammed with pop culture references and jokes invented to show how up-to-the-minute it is in its slang and encyclopedic comic-book know-how.'' He added that visually the film ''is immaculately sleek and gracefully enhanced by 3-D,'' and that ''the opposite of the dark, murky Gotham City of 'Batman,' Metro City is a gleaming hub of institutional architecture, spacious promenades and jutting spires.'' By the time Michael Jackson's ''Bad'' plays near the end of the movie, ''Megamind's nature has largely triumphed over his nurture; heroism becomes him, and Roxanne's love looms as real possibility,'' Mr. Holden said.

AMC said in a news release that the series would capture ''the world of the neighborhood comic-book store and fanboy culture'' and is planned for a first-quarter 2012 premiere. The ever-talkative Mr. Smith, who will be an executive producer of the show, said in a statement that he was ''ecstatic, proud, and extremely lucky to be in bed with a network I watch religiously anyway,'' adding: ''If they'd pushed just a little harder in the negotiations, I'd have done this show for no payment beyond early access to every episode of 'Mad Men,' 'Breaking Bad' and 'Walking Dead.'

2011-09-04T00:00:00Z,"DRIVING to work in Southern California recently, Steven Tiller, a founder of SeaVees sneakers, heard on NPR that the Peace Corps was about to turn 50. Sensing an opportunity in line with the brand's philosophy and midcentury aesthetic, Mr. Tiller and his business partner, Derek Galkin, began sifting through old photos of Peace Corps volunteers. What was on their feet? Narrow plimsolls, a canvas and rubber sneaker commonly worn in the 1960s. ''The idea was to go back in time, reimagine these shoes, and hopefully make them cooler,'' Mr. Tiller said. The resulting sneaker, in salt-washed canvas, has a contrasting suede stripe around its rims and a vintage look. Donations to the Peace Corps will be made for each pair sold at seavees.com and jcrew.com. The Volunteer plimsoll is $78. BRUCE PASK"

Extending the live theater metaphor, the fourth preseason game is an afternoon performance at the Piscataway Summer Stock Playhouse to work out the kinks of the production and integrate the new songs Bono wrote. The N.F.L. knows better than to shine the footlights on the final exhibition games, in which starters parade the sidelines in baseball caps and coaches keep the real playbooks locked in the file cabinet. The whole final-week schedule was shunted onto Thursday and Friday night so Ryan Perrilloux would not have to match star power against Tim Lincecum or Serena Williams. With no national broadcasts, the regional Homer Sports Networks took center stage: the weekend late-night sports anchor got to be a sideline reporter, and Donny's Discount Drywall got to sponsor the extra points."

The Brodsky Center for Innovative Editions and the Mason Gross School of the Arts along with others at Rutgers University who came in contact with June Wayne during her years as a Distinguished Visiting Research Professor (2002-2007) join the art world in mourning her death. The Brodsky Center itself was established by Judith K. Brodsky with Wayne's Tamarind Lithography Workshop as a model. In a lifetime of successes and honors, her appointment at Rutgers was her first professorial appointment, and it was an honor to be able to pay homage to her. Her relationship with the Brodsky Center began long before her tenure at Rutgers. Brodsky had interviewed Wayne for an essay in the Art Journal in the 1970s. They became friends and Wayne became a heroine for Brodsky. In 1997, Brodsky invited Wayne to be an artist in residence at the Brodsky Center, then called the Rutgers Center for Innovative Print and Paper. During that residency, Wayne created a print in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the invention of lithography. The imagery included a litho stone and a whooping crane, Wayne's metaphor for her rescue of the vanishing breed of lithography printers in the United States. Along with her professorial appointment, the Brodsky Center established the June Wayne Archive and Study Room based on Wayne's gift of 3,321 prints (2,555 by Wayne herself) along with works by 128 artists whom she had published. The Brodsky Center donated a representative group of Wayne's prints to the Zimmerli Art Museum, which mounted a retrospective exhibition of Wayne's work to celebrate her appointment. The Brodsky Center also organized an exhibition of her lithographs in New York, as well as shows of her paintings, prints, and tapestries at the Mason Gross School of the Arts Galleries and the Brodsky Center Gallery at the Heldrich. The Brodsky Center was also responsible for the publication of her catalogue raisonne, June Wayne, The Art of Everything. That volume will ensure that a record exists of her lifetime achievement. Research on the book took place during her five years at Rutgers. In recognition of Wayne's contributions to the world of the visual arts, Rutgers University conferred an honorary degree on Wayne in 2005. We extend our sympathy to Wayne's daughter, Robin Claire Park and her granddaughters, Ariane Junah Claire and Jevon Claire. Thomas W. Lollar, Executive Director, Brodsky Center; Judith K.

The seller was J. Christopher Flowers, a prominent New York private equity manager who had un- officially been looking for a buyer for several years but eventually sold through Brown Har- ris Stevens. The sale was recorded in city records on Monday.Mr. Flowers bought the town house in Octo- ber 2006, less than two months after it was list- ed for $55 million, and at the time the sale was the costliest for a single residence in Manhattan history. Brokers say the mansion is now in need of major renovations; Mr. Flowers had begun a gut renovation but then apparently abandoned the plans.

More than 1,300 people a day stream into the complex of refugee camps at Dadaab, Kenya, which is now housing more than 430,000 people in camps designed for 90,000. Many Somalis arrive near death after journeys of weeks with little food. Large numbers of them are children, often without parents. At Dadaab they receive food, medical care, basic shelter -- the emergency relief they need. But they will probably spend years in that desolate grid of white tents, eating gruel that gets thinner toward the end of the month. The camp lacks the money to provide even subsistence rations. In exchange, the refugees give up their rights to move freely and to work."

2011-09-04T00:00:00Z,"SASS--Jennifer Bement September 4, 1942 -- August 28, 2011. Jennifer lived a charmed life of honesty and candor. She was born to Eleanor Allen Bement and Kenyon Theodore Bement at Deaconess Hospital in Spokane Washington. She spent her summers in Twisp and Loon Lake and grew to be a woman of great substance from her early childhood in Spokane, her teens in Detroit and her adult years in Deerfield, Illinois and now these last 36 years in Portland Oregon. She had the most wonderful sense of humor. She is survived by a grateful group of friends, colleagues, her three children, Gretchen, and her husband Will, Jeff and Leticia, Jason and his girlfriend Jenny, one grandchild Kennedy, three adopted grandchildren, Jonathan, Adriana and LaShawna and a great grandson Maddox. As her loving husband of 47 years, I celebrate and treasure the ups and downs of a relationship that remains a truly great partnership. Also celebrating Jennifer are her siblings, Judy Kaiser, Jill McFarlane, Jane Geesman and Jeff Bement and their children, loving spouses and families. I marvel at the extended family we have all become. I include in the extended family her wonderful loving girl scout and grade school friends of 60 years, her old boyfriend Dick, her dear friends Joanne, Diane, Jackie and Bill, Ed, Maria, Elfie and Gary, Dianne, Jane O, Louisa, Cathy and Ernie, Carolyn, Tommy, Natasha, Linda, Susan and Chris Marie, Ben and Jock and those of us she called her ""teachers"". She enjoyed the company and companionship of Mark, Audrey, Kathy, Kevin, Rita, Laurel, Julie, Peggy, Georgia, Sarah, Jean, Sharon, Rachel, Rebekah and Lyle, Beatrice, Bob, John, Jonell , Mary Lou, Penelope, Ron and Sheila, Ron and Michele and a host of others. As the Bement and Sass clans are spread far and wide, I can unequivocally state that Carol and Bob, Patty and Peggy, Marcia and Margie and Mike, Jan and Andy, Ron, Cindy and Kim, Julie and Pauline are all cheering her on much as we have bid goodbye to their loved ones. Special mention to her wonderful and caring crew on-board Eleanor Allen: Timo DeVries and Nathalie, Yasar, Karine, Shane, Julia and Elise and of course, her special friends Jane Conner that had oversight for all financial projects and Lisa Day for all documentary film projects. Among her many accomplishments are the documentary films; Letting Go, a film about death and dying and her dear friend Kay Straight; COUPLES, a documentary on couples in relationship; Women Seen on Television, and a soon to be released documentary called Shelf Life, that captures the intimate joy of reading and the human connection to books: shelflifedocumentary.com. What she was most proud of was her Dip-C and her ability to be there in service for ""other"". She is after all her mother and father's daughter. A defining element of Jennifer's character was her ability to connect to and hold her relationships honestly and forever close. When she entered a room, her presence was felt and a warmth radiated from the very source of her beingness. I will miss her energy but will hold her in my heart until I meet her one day again. A memorial celebration for a ""Life Well Lived"" is planned for Portland friends and family as well as a memorial celebration at The Haven and True North on Gabriola Island in British Columbia. A private celebration will occur on-board the Eleanor Allen at Cannes Film Festival in the New Year 2012. Jennifer and her legacy will live on forever...Godspeed and may the force be with you!! I love you!! We love you!!

''If Tim Robbins pitched 'The Tree of Life' to his studio bosses in 'The Player' the log line would be 'Leave It to Beaver' on steroids meets 'The Flintstones' as drawn by William Blake. But I don't think it would have been green-lighted. Fortunately Terrence Malick doesn't do log lines, and this cinematic visionary was given free reign. Twenty-five years from now, I predict, 'The Help' and 'The Future' will be relegated to the dust heap, and 'The Tree of Life' will be required viewing for any true cinephile.''"

2011-09-05T00:00:00Z,"''The Help'' officially achieved blockbuster status over the weekend by holding onto the No. 1 spot at North American multiplexes for a third consecutive week. That DreamWorks Studios movie, based on the best-selling novel about black maids in the 1960s and their white employers, took in an estimated $14.2 million for a new total of $122 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. Second place went to ''The Debt,'' a Focus Features espionage drama that sold a surprisingly robust $9.7 million in tickets for a total of about $14 million since opening on Wednesday; solid reviews and the potential thrill of seeing Helen Mirren as a retired but still derriere-kicking Mossad agent probably drove interest. The weekend's other two new releases came in neck and neck: ''Apollo 18,'' a thriller from the Weinstein Company, was a limp third with an estimated $8.7 million in ticket sales, and ''Shark Night 3-D'' (Relativity Media) took in about $8.6 million for fourth place. Rounding out the top five was 20th Century Fox's ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes,'' which sold $7.8 million in tickets for a five-week total of about $160 million.

That is a basic principle of economics and antitrust - and it is seemingly irrefutable. The yardstick that the Justice Department applied to its merger analysis is a standard, if complex, tool to measure market concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, or HHI for short.

2011-09-06T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (Ovation) AMÉLIE (2001) Audrey Tautou, above, in her breakthrough role, plays a French sprite working as a waitress who lays out elaborate practical jokes as payback for those who offend her friends. When she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), Amélie finds herself incapable of revealing her feelings and instead turns Paris, recreated through sets and computer-generated imagery, into a kind of treasure hunt as she leaves clues about her identity, and he trails after her. Writing in The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell called this comedy from Jean-Pierre Jeunet, whose original title was ''Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain,'' ''a sugar-rush of a movie.'' It has, he said, ''a hypnotic sense of romance; it's a fable filled with longing, with a heroine who constantly flirts with failure.'' The film's ''fastidious complex of flesh and fantasy is a dazzling achievement,'' Mr. Mitchell added. There is no denying, he said ''that 'Amélie' is, to paraphrase its title, fabulous.'' 1 P.M. (Starz) THE LAST STATION (2009) Leo Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer) and his wife, Sofya (Helen Mirren), battle over his literary estate in this drama from Michael Hoffman, based on Jay Parini's novel about the end of Tolstoy's life. Paul Giamatti plays Vladimir Chertkov, a spiritual guru who Sofya is convinced is trying to marginalize her and manipulate her husband into changing his will. And James McAvoy is Valentin, the nervous young secretary who manages to gain the confidence of both Tolstoys. To say that the actors ''overdo it would be an understatement,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''I can't handicap their Oscar chances, but isn't there a scenery-eating contest every summer out on Coney Island?'' (Mr. Plummer and Ms. Mirren each earned Academy Award nominations.) Mr. Scott added that it's ''the kind of movie that gives literature a bad name.''"

2011-09-06T00:00:00Z,"A United States District Court in Washington has rejected the Hungarian government's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed against it and its museums and a university for artworks claimed by heirs of the Jewish banker and renowned collector Baron Mor Lipot Herzog. For more than two decades Herzog's heirs have been petitioning the Hungarian government to return more than $100 million worth of art, most of which has been hanging in Hungarian museums, where it was left for safekeeping during World War II or was placed after it was recovered from the Nazis and brought back to Hungary. Baron Herzog died in 1934. Years of requests have been rebuffed, and in July 2010 the Herzog family filed a lawsuit asking not only for the return of more than 40 artworks including paintings, sculptures and other works by El Greco, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Zubarán, Van Dyck, Velázquez and Monet, but also asking the Hungarian government for an accounting of all art from the Herzog family in its possession. Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle ruled late Thursday against Hungary's argument that its state-owned museums and university are immune from jurisdiction of the United States courts under the United States Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. She did dismiss the heirs' claims regarding 11 works, citing Hungarian judicial proceedings that she declined to revisit. Judge Huvelle's ruling will require Hungary to open government and museum records, allowing scrutiny of its Holocaust-era actions regarding looted artworks. Michael S. Shuster, the Herzog family's lawyer, said in a statement, ''We look forward to proceeding with discovery of the Hungarian government's shameful conduct in taking and refusing to return the family's artworks.''"

Some of their responses follow: As an actor in community theater, where the criticism is so unprofessional (on every level) as to be laughable, I can say that it's very disappointing to read either a ''This is the best show ever'' or a ''This is the worst show ever'' review. Can we get a little information here? I learn nothing that might help my performance, and if I'm going to see another company's show, I learn nothing that will tell me what to expect. All of that said, this is also a product of our society -- it's perfectly fine to eviscerate or deep-fry anyone or anything. It's not. Harsh criticism can still be polite. If you don't have a strong enough command of vocabulary to get your point across without being mean, you should find another job."

Of course, businesses want an overhaul of the corporate tax code that would reduce rates for the long term. But for now they are seeking a series of tax holidays, including a payroll tax break for employers, not just employees, and a tax break to let companies repatriate about $1 trillion that is sitting overseas. In turn, they say, they will spend it on new recruits, perhaps as many as 2.9 million of them, according to a letter the United States Chamber of Commerce sent to the president on Monday."

He was Chairman of the Executive Committee of Bozell Worldwide (Advertising), Inc. and, previously, was Chairman and CEO of Kenyon & Eckhardt, Inc. (K&E).

As CEO of K&E, and as an advisor to Lee Iacocca, Leo contributed significantly to the turnaround of Chrysler Corporation in 1979, by creating the ad campaign that helped to revive the ailing company and reshape its image. He was credited for restoring Chrysler's reputation in the eyes of the industry and the car-buying public. In his illustrious career, he also created highly successful ad campaigns for other leading automotive companies, such as Ford, General Motors, Daimler-Chrysler and Mitsubishi. Additionally, Leo served on the boards of many public companies, including Lorimar Telepictures, Online Software, and True North Communications. He also received numerous honors and awards for his service outside of the advertising industry, including the Guggenheim World Peace Award (1951), the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Award as The Outstanding Young Man of 1955 in charity, art, athletics and business thus upholding Theodore Roosevelt's belief that, ""No man be dedicated to one venture or activity but to maintain a multitude of endeavors which each in its own way leads to the enrichment of human life."" Mr. Kelmenson was awarded the Silver Quill Poetry Award in 1955 for ""Epilogue"", a book of poetry, reflecting his wartime experiences, the American Jewish Committee's Human Relations Award, the Catholic Charities Humanitarian Award (1989) and the Reserve Officers Association Award (1963). In the early 60's, he served in the White House as the Special Project Officer for the U.S. Department of State under President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. And, in the 1990's, he served as Chairman of the Board of the Development Committee at New York University's Tisch School of Arts. Born in New York City, Leo served with the U.S. Marine Corps in World War II First Parachute Division in the Pacific Theatre, South Pacific operations. He was awarded the Navy and Marine medal, the Bronze Star, two purple hearts, a Meritorious Unit Citation for bravery on the battlefield and was a Reserve Lieutenant Colonel. He graduated from Columbia University and studied at the Career Diplomat School of the University of Geneva. Leo was also a noted philanthropist, having supported numerous charities and causes. He served on the Boards of Directors of the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Foundation, the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, the President's Council of the American Diabetes Association, the National Cancer Foundation, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, the Theodore Roosevelt Foundation, the United States Olympic Committee, and the Advertising Club of New York. He was a founding member of the African Medical & Research Foundation and Dr. Armand Hammer's Stop Cancer Foundation. Leo was also a member of the Sands Point Yacht Club and the United States Yacht Racing Association. He is survived by his beloved wife Gayle, their daughter, Philippa, his sons, Todd and Joel, and two grandchildren, Lana and Kyle. A memorial service will be held at a later date.

His barked out lyrics are first person and loop through cryptic, emotionally raw experiences. A dubstep influence is there, but mostly in his modern sensibility as his music is guitar-anchored. For the last year or two, Marshall has played around Britain under the name Zoo Kid, heading to gigs after school, on weekends and over holidays. This past July he played under his new moniker, King Krule, at a festival in Hyères, France. With his second release due out in October, his seriousness is a welcome counterweight to the YouTube-driven fame of his contemporaries like Justin Bieber and Cody Simpson.

CAROLINE WOZNIACKI VS. ANDREA PETKOVIC For someone who has been dominating the women's game for the better part of the past two years, Wozniacki always looks so darn beatable on court. Without a dominant shot, Wozniacki, the world No. 1 and 2009 Open runner-up, wins by keeping balls in play and waiting for her opponents to beat themselves. She is virtually immune to pressure and seems to know exactly when her opponent is about to crack. The 10th-seeded Petkovic is having her best year as a professional and comes into this match knowing she can beat Wozniacki on hardcourts, having defeated her in Miami this summer. Does she have the mental game to overcome Wozniacki in a quarterfinal on one of the biggest stages in tennis? I want to say yes, but I feel Wozniacki is going to find a way to win this match."

2011-09-07T00:00:00Z,"The Beatles have taken one more baby step into the world of digital music. After having had all of their original albums put on sale through Apple's iTunes in November, the Beatles on Tuesday released a downloadable version of ''1,'' their 27-song greatest-hits album from 2000, again available only through iTunes. As its title suggests, ''1'' contains songs that reached No. 1 in the United States or Britain, like ''Love Me Do'' (released in 1962, reaching No. 1 in the United States in 1964) and ''The Long and Winding Road'' (released and reaching the top spot in 1970). The album has sold 30 million copies around the world since its release, and in the United States it was the best-selling album of the first decade of the 2000s. It may be hard to imagine that there are any Beatles fans left who have not already bought their music. But in addition to completists, the digital release of ''1'' may appeal to the thriftiest of the band's fans. The original Beatles albums sell for $12.99 each on iTunes, with individual songs going for $1.29. But ''1'' costs $9.99, and almost immediately after its release on Tuesday it shot to the top of iTunes's internal sales ranking. iTunes has an exclusive deal to sell Beatles downloads, but neither Apple nor the band's label, EMI, has revealed how long that deal will last."

""That's scary!"" Liden exclaimed the other morning, sitting at a table at Karma, Brendan Dugan's bookshop and design studio on Downing Street in the West Village. The New York Liden lays bare in her new book, ""Out of My Mind ... Back in 5 Minutes,"" is not the sort of place you'd want to leave your personal belongings unattended. Trash bags pile up in the streets like body bags, a slick of dark liquid might be oil or it might be blood, even a rock in central park has the menacing look of a giant, gaunt-eyed skull.

The book is compiled from images swiped from the Internet, photos taken with a BlackBerry and installation shots from Liden's recent shows at Maccarone and Salon 94 including a series of self-portraits in which she wore various plastic deli shopping bags. A recurring chorus of slogans appropriated from souvenir T-shirts delivers the punchline. ""Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most."""

It was precisely the kind of moment that the Romney campaign must have been hoping for, and thanks to the moderators' questions and Perry's answers, it fell into Romney's lap without him having to even raise the issue. As soon as the exchange happened, a Romney adviser e-mailed Politico's Ben Smith: ""[Perry] has lost. No federal candidate has ever won on the Perry program to kill Social Security. Never has. never will."" That's spin, yes, but I'm sure the Romney people believe the basic premise. As well they should. Everything we know about American voters - and yes, Republican primary voters very much included - suggests that Perry's comments will eventually be deadly to his electoral prospects."

On the basis of that incorrect date, the column erroneously faulted the site for not disclosing Mr. Arrington's investment in a positive TechCrunch article about Milk on April 4. That article did not disclose Mr. Arrington's investment because it had not yet been made. TechCrunch disclosed the investment in an article on April 26; it was not the case that TechCrunch failed to disclose that Mr. Arrington was an investor.

She graduated cum laude from The Albany Academy for Girls in 1941 and graduated as a Wellesley College Scholar in 1945 with a B.A. in Political Science.

In 1969, Sidney earned her Juris Doctorate from NYU School of Law and served as a staff attorney for the Juvenile Relations Division of The Legal Aid Society in New York from 1971-1981. Inspired by conversations with children from The Whitby School carpool, Sidney authored the children's book You Be The Judge. The book challenges the reader for decisions in legal cases and their precedents, and was intended to give children a better understanding of the law and its role in society. Residing in Manhattan for the past three decades, Sidney was a longstanding volunteer at the Guggenheim Museum, The Asia Society, and the English Speaking Union. Sidney's family is graced with her many original watercolor paintings and collections of ""Easy Thoughts.""

Sure, there were a few balls struck in the morning, but the rains came soon after those matches got under way and never let up. Thinking optimistically about the forecast, here are the top matches on tap for Thursday: CAROLINE WOZNIACKI VS. ANDREA PETKOVIC For someone who has been all but dominating the women's game for the better part of the past two years, Wozniacki always looks so darn beatable on court. Without a dominant shot, she wins by keeping balls in play and waiting for her opponents to beat themselves. The 10th-seeded Petkovic is having her best year as a professional. She defeated Wozniacki on hardcourts in Miami this summer. Does she have the mental game to overcome Wozniacki in a quarterfinal on one of the biggest stages in tennis? I want to say yes, but I feel Wozniacki is going to find a way to win this match."
2011-09-08T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (TCM) 50 YEARS OF MERCHANT IVORY In 1961 the producer Ismail Merchant and the director James Ivory formed Merchant Ivory Productions with the intention of making English-language films in India for an international market. Soon the company was generating acclaim for elegant adaptations of works by Henry James and E. M. Forster created on modest budgets, often with scripts by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. ''It is a strange marriage we have at Merchant Ivory,'' Mr. Merchant (above left with Mr. Ivory) once said. ''I am an Indian Muslim, Ruth is a German Jew, and Jim is a Protestant American.'' This monthlong tribute, with 21 feature films and 5 shorts shown across 5 Thursdays, picks up with ''The Europeans'' (1979), about a New England household upset by the arrival of two cousins (Lee Remick and Tim Woodward) , followed at 9:45 by ''The Bostonians'' (1984), about a Mississippi lawyer (Christopher Reeve) and a suffragist (Vanessa Redgrave) who compete for the attentions of a faith healer's charismatic daughter (Madeleine Potter), and at midnight by ''Roseland'' (1977), three stories set in the Roseland ballroom in Manhattan in the 1970s and featuring Teresa Wright, Lou Jacobi and Christopher Walken. The program ends with ''Quartet'' (1981), starring Isabelle Adjani as a vulnerable foreigner in post-World War I Paris who moves into the home of a hedonistic English couple (Alan Bates and Maggie Smith) after her husband's arrest leaves her penniless, at 2 a.m.; and ''Savages'' (1972), about tribal people who move into a Long Island estate and transform themselves into social lions, at 4. 6 A.M. (Oxygen) THE DUCHESS (2008) No bodices rip in this historical drama from Saul Dibb, but Ralph Fiennes, as the Duke of Devonshire, does takes scissors to the unmentionables of Georgiana Spencer, the Duchess of Devonshire, played by Keira Knightley, right, in this adaptation of a biography by Amanda Foreman. Charlotte Rampling plays Georgiana's mother, all too eager to pimp out her teenage daughter to the wealthy older man. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called this film, with screenplay by Mr. Dibb, Jeffrey Hatcher and Anders Thomas Jensen, ''an overstuffed, intellectually underbaked portrait of a poor little rich girl.'' In ''Atonement'' (2007), at 11, Joe Wright and Christopher Hampton's adaptation of the Ian McEwan novel, Saoirse Ronan plays Briony, a 13-year-old aspiring playwright who accuses Robbie (James McAvoy) , the son of a family servant -- and the lover of her older sister, Cecelia (Ms. Knightley) -- of a crime. Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave are Briony as a young woman and as an older writer."

The more time he spent with them, the closer he was able to get until, he recalls, ""Eventually, they scarcely noticed I was there."" McDean wasn't shooting with any particular end in mind, except perhaps to fill the hours of the day and to feed his childhood obsession with martial arts. A few of the photos were published in The Face. The rest sat in a drawer. ""At the time I dismissed a lot of photos because I was trying to get everything sharp,"" says McDean, who reedited them with a fresh eye. In ""Sumo,"" an intimate hand-bound volume from Mörel books, and in an accompanying show at the Half Gallery, McDean captures a sport akin to mountain moving in moments of unexpected fluidity and grace with Baconesque piles of flesh coming together as if in a dance. The book is punctuated with moments of stillness, like a portrait of a young wrestler whose hair is being pulled up into a knot. ""Their hair is done, they are dressed, they are taken care of,"" McDean says, realizing that perhaps the world of sumo wasn't so far from the world of fashion as he might originally have thought. ""He's like a model sitting in a chair."""

2011-09-09T00:00:00Z,"I've developed a habit - it's probably a bad habit - of assigning letter grades to the Republican candidates based on my initial reaction to their performance in debates. After Wednesday night's debate in Simi Valley, I gave Rick Perry a B-minus, meaning an average performance. Meanwhile, I gave Mitt Romney, his primary rival for the Republican nomination, a higher grade of A-minus. The grades are based on neither style nor substance per se, but instead mostly on strategy: how much each candidate did to improve his chances of winning the nomination. Newt Gingrich, for example, got in some good one-liners and seemed more poised than he had in past debates. But in deliberately avoiding contrasts between himself and the other candidates, he did little to give Republican voters a reason to pick him - something he needs to do, since he's standing at about 4 percent in the polls."

''Fashion gives you a choice,'' he says. ''You can hide behind it or use it to express yourself. I can use fashion and design to transform anyone that walks through the door. It's all about finding that thing in a person that ignites change.'' In this new makeover series, part of ''Full Frontal Fashion,'' the channel's annual programming tribute to New York Fashion Week, Mr. Sparo offers some sartorially lost souls ''design therapy'' in his East Village studio, where he helps his clients battle their inhibitions. His first subjects include Jennifer, a new mother who finds her postbaby curves too matronly; the six-foot-tall Nefe, who is sometimes mistaken for a man; and Tali, a showgirl and Mr. Sparo's secret crush, who needs a 10-piece ensemble for her Las Vegas act. 2 P.M.

Now a series of his drawings and paintings that chronicle his journeys in Asia will be coming to the Gagosian Gallery, the first time that Mr. Dylan's art will be exhibited in New York City, the gallery said. The exhibition, ''The Asia Series,'' will run at the Gagosian on the Upper East Side from Sept. 20 through Oct. 22, and will include works that Mr. Dylan created on trips to Japan, China, Vietnam and South Korea. (Dylanologists will recall that the singer-songwriter played his first shows in China and in Vietnam last spring.) The gallery said in a news release that Mr. Dylan's works would offer ''firsthand depictions of people, street scenes, architecture and landscape'' with evocative titles like ''Mae Ling,'' ''Cockfight,'' ''The Bridge'' and ''Hunan Province.'' The release added: ''Conversely, there are more cryptic paintings often of personalities and situations, such as 'Big Brother' and 'Opium,' or 'LeBelle Cascade,' which looks like a riff on Manet's 'Le De jeuner sur l'Herbe' but which is, in fact, a scenographic tourist photo-opportunity in a Tokyo amusement arcade.'' Mr. Dylan's paintings have previously been shown in Chemnitz, Germany (where the exhibition ''The Drawn Blank Series'' opened in 2007), the Statens Museum in Copenhagen (where his ''Brazil Series'' was shown in 2008) and any rec room where the cover of his ''Self Portrait'' album has been prominently displayed."

In a news release the show (which does not yet have a title or a premiere date) is described as chronicling a television anchor and his staff as ''they set out on a patriotic and quixotic mission to do the news well in the face of corporate and commercial obstacles and their own personal entanglements.'' Jeff Daniels (whose films include ''The Squid and the Whale'' and ''Good Night, and Good Luck'') will play the fictional news anchor Will McAllister; Emily Mortimer (''Our Idiot Brother'') will play his executive producer, MacKenzie; and Sam Waterston (''Law & Order'') will play their boss, Charlie."

Walcott made the traditional five-borough tour, saying his ''goal is to set a high bar for our parents, our teachers, to aspire to.'' At Public School 295 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, third graders peppered Mr. Walcott with questions about his reading habits. The chancellor said that he liked to read about ''people and history,'' and that his wife had given him a book about Frederick Douglass for his 60th birthday on Wednesday. The students, for their part, said they liked reading ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid,'' and books about animals and mysteries. One girl said she liked reading books about New York."

2011-09-09T00:00:00Z,"SACKS--Dr. Herbert S, a clinical professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association, and an international medical consultant died on August 30, 2011 in New Haven, Connecticut. He was 84 years old. Dr. Sacks was a longtime leader of professional psychiatric organizations, first in Connecticut, and then nationally. In this capacity, his broad concern was how modern psychiatry is represented in society. His contributions to the understanding of such issues as patient advocacy and confidentiality have informed social policy. As president of the Connecticut Psychiatric Association, Dr. Sacks led a successful campaign to mandate group insurance coverage for outpatient psychiatric treatment, the first such state legislation in the country. In 1997, as the president of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), he spearheaded a national initiative for mental health parity in insurance coverage as part of a policy of universal access to mental health care, testifying before a Presidential advisory commission, collaborating with national legislators, and making the case against the ""industrialization of American medicine"", as capitated managed care threatened the survival of individualized psychotherapy by psychiatrists. As a member on the National Commission on the Confidentiality of Health Records, Dr. Sacks was a forceful proponent for the maintenance of confidentiality of medical records, both to protect the integrity of the physician-patient relationship, and to safeguard against discrimination based on public disclosures of treatment. He strongly supported the ""Goldwater Rule"" promulgated in the APA's Principles of Medical Ethics, barring psychiatrists from offering professional opinions regarding anyone they have not personally examined. This guidance developed after Barry Goldwater was subjected to public statements questioning his mental fitness for office by physicians who had not examined him, prior to the 1964 Presidential election. During the 1960's, Dr. Sacks consulted to the U.S. Peace Corps, preparing young volunteers for their service overseas and acclimation upon their return. An advocate for culturally sensitive health care development, he continued his work as an international health consultant, focusing on the psychological impact of population dislocations caused by natural disasters and water development projects. He undertook these efforts in association with numerous medical schools, development assistance organizations and the U. S. Agency for International Development. Dr. Sacks was an early advocate for the integration of traditional healing into structured public health programs, in conjunction with village leaders and traditional healers. Dr. Sacks remained active as a founding member of Yale School of Medicine's Committee on International Health for more than 40 years. He was enthusiastic about his service on the Downs Fellowship Committee, which awards international student travel grants to Yale medical, nursing and physician assistant students pursuing scientific research and cultural exchange in developing countries. He was also a consultant to the Yale Five Year B.A. Program, which encouraged undergraduates to take a year away from college to work in developing countries, when such interruptions of college careers were uncommon. Dr. Sacks had recently been elected to a term on the Board of the Association of Yale Alumni in Medicine. Amongst his publications, Dr. Sacks was most enthusiastic about his book, Hurdles: The Admissions Dilemma in American Higher Education, (Atheneum 1978), which continues to be relevant today. Dr. Sacks was born in New York City in 1926, the son of Rabbi Maxwell and Mrs. Anna Sacks. He grew up in Brooklyn and enlisted as an ensign in the U.S. Navy at 17, serving in the South Pacific. He was a graduate of Dickinson College, where he later became a member of the Board of Alumni Advisors, and a graduate of Cornell School of Medicine. Dr. Sacks trained in pediatrics and child psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine, and joined the faculty of the Yale Child Study Center more than 50 years ago. Up until the time of his death, he maintained a private practice in Westport, Connecticut. In 1948, Dr. Sacks married Helen Margery Levin. They enjoyed a 63 year marriage. Mrs. Sacks, who retired as an assistant clinical professor of social work at the Yale Child Study Center, was always her husband's chief advisor and critic. She co-founded and directed a psychiatric clinic for the assessment of serious offenders in New Haven Juvenile Court, and shared many research interests with her husband. Dr. Sacks enjoyed private family time on his farm in Southern Vermont, the company of good friends, the glorious music of the Marlboro Music Festival, eclectic Vermont hardware stores, and late nights reading scores of police procedural novels set in his favorite foreign locales. He is survived by his wife; four children, Eric and Douglas of New York City, Russell of Albuquerque, NM, and Kate of New Haven; and seven grandchildren. Memorial contributions may be made to Marlboro Music (http://www.marlboromusic.org) or to the Yale School of Public Health, Downs Fellowship (http://publichealth.yale.edu/giving/gift).

2011-09-10T20:30:30Z,"""The timing just feels right,"" said Helmut Lang's creative directors, Michael and Nicole Colovos, days before the label's first runway show in more than five years at the cavernous Pier 57 warehouse on Manhattan's Far West Side. With the help of the stylist Alastair McKimm and the producer and set designer Alexandre de Betak, the duo achieved exactly the effect they were going for: a dramatic show referencing 90s minimalism (a nod to the original Helmut Lang look) set against a backdrop so raw it magnified the collection's softness, something that the Colovoses have bestowed upon the label since taking over in 2007. ""We've always explored contrasts in texture and fabric,"" Ms. Colovos said. And there were billowy silk trousers, asymmetrical handkerchief dresses and washed leather jackets paired back to single-shoulder-strap sports bras and made-for-stomping platforms designed by Alejandro Ingelmo to prove that. For McKimm, who created the look, the biggest challenge was editing the collection, and he did so by forgoing a pink story and a print, using only a selection of canary-yellow pieces to pop amongst all the black and white. As for the venue, de Betak was dead set on using an open space that had not been touched too much; the less pomp and circumstance, the better. The final stage, a square platform perched high above the ground, lent gravitas to the exceptionally strong clothes it carried."

The film focuses on the experience one woman (Tilda Swinton) has raising a son (Ezra Miller) who turns out to be a very, very bad seed."
2011-09-10T16:18:15Z,"Unlike some creatives who choke under pressure, the menswear designer Antonio Azzuolo, a finalist for this year's CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, gracefully eased the reins and took a more relaxed approach to his Spring/Summer collection. Mr. Azzuolo explained backstage, ""My first collection was very formal, all about suits. This season I designed more liberally, drawing inspiration from Les Minets, a French/British hybrid movement of mod culture. These young men shunned bourgeois culture, but still dressed up. They were rough and rebellious, but chic and sophisticated as well."" Noting the designer's departure from his norm of neat, the hairstylist Andre Rodman casually styled models' hair with his hands and a healthy dollop of Shu Uemura Shape Paste, to enhance each guy's individual hair texture. Mr. Rodman completed looks with a brisk shake of the dryer, along with ""lots of Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray, for a subtly messy, matte look."" The makeup artist Gregory Arlt paired hair and clothes with M.A.C. products that conveyed, ""Healthy tired. It might sound strange, but we imagined the guys looking warm and attractive, despite their penchant for partying."" Using just moisturizer (as opposed to foundation) for a base, Arlt slathered onto the models' faces a yet to be released product from M.A.C.- Mineralize Charged Water Moisture Gel (hitting shelves this December). Brows were then defined and filled in with Kid eyeshadow, while lips were smoothed with lip conditioner. Lastly, he dotted on Select Moisturecover Concealer as necessary, so models looked ""handsome, even after that long night out."""
2011-09-10T16:13:07Z,"My favorite vacation involves backpacking in the mountains with my family - unplugged, out of contact and engaging with the most beautiful scenery in America. And that's what inspired my Sunday column: If America's ""best idea"" is its public lands, then it's an idea under assault. But while environmentalists focus on Republican efforts to reduce protections of those lands, it seems to me that an equal challenge is the way the public is withdrawing from nature. Conservation should be about preserving nature, yes, but also about giving people a chance to experience it."

Ms. Minaj, who will appear in a new MAC Viva Glam campaign, wore a bikini top that was half hot pink and half purple, some crazy graffiti-covered tights, a silver ballerina skirt and, in her big curly blonde hair, an iridescent pink bow that matched the chain of her necklace that had attached to it a hot pink pendant in the shape of a pretzel."

2011-09-10T14:10:39Z,"""We usually have a strong beauty concept,"" said the stylist Natasha Royt backstage at Mandy Coon. ""This time it's modern, approachable, realistic, low maintenance-- cool. We want to let the graphic, modern clothes speak for themselves."" Last season's wig-wrapped hair and black, fringed, pastel falls turned into ""effortless glamour"" this season, according to Rolando Beauchamp. Loose waves came by way of Bumble + Bumble Gel, a blow dry, and then a one-inch curling iron wrapped at the shaft of the hair, all set with Bumble + Bumble Grooming Creme and roughed up with BB Texture for a messy, matte finish. The last step ensured that nothing was ""too pretty or too shiny."" Coon's color-blocked looks were translated into Mark Rothko-inspired, multi-step eyes at the hands of the makeup artist Francelle Daly for NARS. Lavender-grey Lhasa was the primary shadow. ""I'm obsessed with this shade,"" Daly said. ""It's rarely used for spring/summer collections."" She also added a trio of pinks with an icy tone at both corners of the eye. The Rue Bonaparte Larger Than Life Eyeliner pencil, a natural beige, was used to neutralize under the eye while white Santa Monica Boulevard lined inside. Madison Avenue grey was drawn as triangles on the outer edge of the lid. Without mascara on the bottom lashes, this all contributed to a ""special effect"" accompanied by a raspberry lip. An effect that caused one model to comment, ""I look like I've been crying."" Her friend countered, ""No, you look beautiful."""
2011-09-10T14:08:38Z,"If only it had started raining an hour earlier, as the look for both hair and makeup at Helmut Lang's first runway show - with Nicole and Michael Colovos at the helm - was described in one word: ""wet."" Lisa Butler explained the effect created with Temptu Airpod shadow to the brow and Champagne airbrush gloss at the lash as ""jump out of shower"" makeup. It follows that nails were simply Priti's pink Coronation. The theme was carried over with Paul Hanlon for Catwalk by TIGI's undone knots. Hair at the lower half of the head was left long and loose with a final shot of Your Highness Weightless Shine Spray. ""It's a morning show, so everyone comes with clean hair,"" Mr. Hanlon said. ""That's the opposite of what we're doing."" Let the rain begin."

2011-09-10T13:00:24Z,"""It was really embarrassing,"" said Revlon's Global Artistic Director, Gucci Westman, dressed in a tweed aqua blazer, baggy white pants and leopard slippers backstage at Rag & Bone. ""My husband (Rag & Bone designer David Neville) called and said, 'Where are you? We need the turquoise trousers for the show.'"" By accident, Westman had selected a look that made it into the final collection, instead of an edit, to wear today, a mistake that was quickly corrected. ""It's the strongest Spring, yet,"" she said explaining her excitement at the '70s surf vacation and 90s rave culture-inspired pieces. She chose a minimal makeup look, so as not to compete with the bright colors of the clothes. Eyes were simply taupe Revlon 16H shadow in Addictive with a touch of Sueded Brow liner. Cheeks were tinted with a light bronzer and blush in Tawny Peach while lips were pale pink, coated with shine and patted with powder. ""Personally, I don't think lip gloss is cool."" What is cool-- and consistently Rag & Bone-- appears to be grey nails. Jin Soon Choi took last season's slate to a lighter shade of concrete- Revlon's Smoky Canvas or Hazy. As for hair, Guido Palau admitted the idea was ""effortless,"" though the process was anything but. ""Eighty percent of the New York designers want ease. It always looks glamorous,"" he said. To achieve this, Palau tightly braided the underside of the models' hair and then added extensions for length to create the illusion of fineness. He then used Redken Satinwear all over damp hair which he dried with a Mason Pearson brush and Sultra tools. The hair was then clamped at the neck with a Velcro strap to create a bob-like effect. Ah, this explains the rave reference."
2011-09-10T12:57:58Z,"Friday night, after checking out a cheeky and borderline shameful Parke & Ronen runway show that suggested the male modeling industry may soon be facing its own steroid scandal, I popped over to Jason Wu's afterparty at Adour in the St. Regis Hotel. After muscle-bound mutants in skimpy swimwear, it was a pleasure to see some grown-ups in evening attire. Nacho Figueras and Delfina Blaquier looked smashing, he in a sharp black suit, she in a one-shouldered black dress, standing next to a D.J. booth that was covered over with hydrangea blossoms. I almost had my appetite back when I picked up what appeared to be a mint-colored petit four, only to bite into a watercress-wrapped piece of salmon."
