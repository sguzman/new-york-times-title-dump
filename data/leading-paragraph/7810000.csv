2014-09-24T00:00:00Z,"TARLOV--Jill Anne, age 58, of Fairfield, Conn. and New York City, passed away on Sunday, September 21, 2014 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She succumbed to injuries suffered three days earlier when she was tragically struck by a cyclist in New York's Central Park. Jill was born on November 25, 1955 in Norwalk, Conn. to Harriett and Malcolm Tarlov. She grew up in Norwalk along with her brother Mark and attended Norwalk High School before continuing her studies at Boston University, where she earned her Bachelor of Science degree in communications. In 1982, she was hired by Westinghouse Broadcasting Company (now CBS) to oversee marketing, public relations and advertising for 1010 WINS, the nation's oldest all-news radio station, in New York City. While working at WINS, Jill met Michael Wittman, the station's financial controller. They married in Ridgefield, Conn. on April 20, 1986. Scott Herman, who worked with Jill at WINS and is now Executive Vice President, Operations, CBS Radio, said, ""Jill loved her time at 1010 WINS, especially because she met Mike there. She was fun loving and cared about others. When you were her friend, you were a friend for life."" Jill had a tremendous passion for children in both her personal and professional life. As parents, she and Mike were blessed with a son, Matthew (age 24), and a daughter, Anna (age 23). Jill regularly embraced her passion for life by serving as a volunteer, with an emphasis on working with children. She dedicated considerable time to working with inner-city youth, in addition to working in a garden for kids. Jill believed in the difference her time would make in children's futures and her passion for helping them was contagious to those around her. In 1986, Jill transitioned from 1010 WINS to Group W Television Sales (now CBS Television Sales) and was responsible for marketing the public service initiative ""For Kids' Sake."" While devoting much of her time to raising Matthew and Anna during their formative years, Jill also pursued her continuing education by earning a graduate certificate in teaching and learning with technology from Teachers College at Columbia University, the oldest and largest graduate school of education in the country. She later received her Master of Arts in educational technology from Fairfield University. In 2005, Jill began a deeply meaningful six years with the Anti-Defamation League in New York City. Originally hired to support ADL's multimedia Holocaust education project, she went on to serve in a number of roles in support of the human rights organization's mission to combat hate and anti-Semitism. Abraham H. Foxman, National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, said, ""Everyone here is devastated by the news about our good friend and colleague, Jill Tarlov. Jill was a warm, engaging, and deeply caring person, a terrific colleague and a good friend to many people on our staff."" In 2011, Jill became the first marketing director at Partnership with Children, an organization that provides counseling to at-risk students at New York City's public schools. Jill is survived by her loving husband of 28 years, Mike, who is employed as Senior Vice President of Finance for the CBS Television Stations group; their two children, Matthew and Anna; and her brother, Mark Tarlov. With the sudden loss of our beloved Jill, her family plans to establish a permanent legacy in the form of a charitable fund in her name to carry on her dedication and love for helping others. Persons who wish to honor Jill's memory may send donations to the Jill Tarlov Fund, c/o Charles Lenore, Esq, Day Pitney LLP, 242 Trumbull St., Hartford, CT 06103."

2014-09-24T00:00:00Z,"BANDY--Mary Lea. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the loss of Mary Lea Bandy. Mary Lea began her career at the Museum in 1973 as an associate editor in Publications, after having been an editor of art history publications at Harry N. Abrams, Inc. She was appointed Director of MoMA's Film Department in 1980, and Chief Curator of the Department of Film and Video (later the Department of Film and Media) in 1994, a title she held until her retirement in 2005. In addition to her Film Department responsibilities she served as MoMA's Deputy Director for Curatorial Affairs from 1999 to 2005 and played an instrumental role in the Museum's 2004 expansion project. Mary Lea championed the restoration and preservation of film as an art form, as evidenced by her tireless work during the creation of The Celeste Bartos Film Preservation Center, which opened in 1996. She facilitated the acquisition of hundreds of films for the Museum, including those of Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Federico Fellini, Martin Scorsese, and Andy Warhol. She also coproduced two films, helped to create the Women's Film Preservation Fund of New York Women in Films and Television, a unique program devoted exclusively to saving films by women filmmakers, and organized many exhibitions for MoMA and several international archives. The French government named her Chevalier des Arts et Lettres in 1984 and Officier des Arts et Lettres in 1992. In 1999 she received the MUSE Award from New York Women in Film and Television. In 2012 she published her comprehensive story of the American Western, ""Ride, Boldly Ride,"" with Kevin Stoehr. Mary Lea's passion for film firmly established the moving image as a pillar of MoMA's curatorial activities, and she will be sorely missed. Like the heroes of the American Westerns that she loved so dearly, Mary Lea was a true and loyal friend and colleague. We will miss her dearly. We send our deepest sympathies to her husband, Gary, and all of her family. The Board of Trustees of The Museum of Modern Art"

In the United States Navy, between '52-'55 during the Korean War, Howard flew as a Lieutenant JG Airman from the carrier USS Princeton.

Here he held positions as VP Operations '72 '79; COO '79 '81; Chairman '83 '89; President '81-'89 and CEO '82 '89. In the 1990s Amstar was owned/controlled principally by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners (MLCP). When Amstar divested its' major businesses-related to the production and distribution of sugar, the remaining companies, the largest of which was Milwaukee Electric Tool Inc., were merged with another MLCP controlled company in a similar industry known as ESSEX Industries. Howard became the Chairman of this new combined entity called ESSTAR Inc. 1989-1996. During this same period Howard was Chairman of Tambrands, 1993-1996.

2014-09-25T00:00:00Z,"TARLOV--Jill Anne, age 58, of Fairfield, Conn. and New York City, passed away on Sunday, September 21, 2014 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She succumbed to injuries suffered three days earlier when she was tragically struck by a cyclist in New York's Central Park. Jill was born on November 25, 1955 in Norwalk, Conn. to Harriett and Malcolm Tarlov. She grew up in Norwalk along with her brother Mark and attended Norwalk High School before continuing her studies at Boston University, where she earned her Bachelor of Science degree in communications. In 1982, she was hired by Westinghouse Broadcasting Company (now CBS) to oversee marketing, public relations and advertising for 1010 WINS, the nation's oldest all-news radio station, in New York City. While working at WINS, Jill met Michael Wittman, the station's financial controller. They married in Ridgefield, Conn. on April 20, 1986. Scott Herman, who worked with Jill at WINS and is now Executive Vice President, Operations, CBS Radio, said, ""Jill loved her time at 1010 WINS, especially because she met Mike there. She was fun loving and cared about others. When you were her friend, you were a friend for life."" Jill had a tremendous passion for children in both her personal and professional life. As parents, she and Mike were blessed with a son, Matthew (age 24), and a daughter, Anna (age 23). Jill regularly embraced her passion for life by serving as a volunteer, with an emphasis on working with children. She dedicated considerable time to working with inner-city youth, in addition to working in a garden for kids. Jill believed in the difference her time would make in children's futures and her passion for helping them was contagious to those around her. In 1986, Jill transitioned from 1010 WINS to Group W Television Sales (now CBS Television Sales) and was responsible for marketing the public service initiative ""For Kids' Sake."" While devoting much of her time to raising Matthew and Anna during their formative years, Jill also pursued her continuing education by earning a graduate certificate in teaching and learning with technology from Teachers College at Columbia University, the oldest and largest graduate school of education in the country. She later received her Master of Arts in educational technology from Fairfield University. In 2005, Jill began a deeply meaningful six years with the Anti-Defamation League in New York City. Originally hired to support ADL's multimedia Holocaust education project, she went on to serve in a number of roles in support of the human rights organization's mission to combat hate and anti-Semitism. Abraham H. Foxman, National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, said, ""Everyone here is devastated by the news about our good friend and colleague, Jill Tarlov. Jill was a warm, engaging, and deeply caring person, a terrific colleague and a good friend to many people on our staff."" In 2011, Jill became the first marketing director at Partnership with Children, an organization that provides counseling to at-risk students at New York City's public schools. Jill is survived by her loving husband of 28 years, Mike, who is employed as Senior Vice President of Finance for the CBS Television Stations group; their two children, Matthew and Anna; and her brother, Mark Tarlov. With the sudden loss of our beloved Jill, her family plans to establish a permanent legacy in the form of a charitable fund in her name to carry on her dedication and love for helping others. Persons who wish to honor Jill's memory may send donations to the Jill Tarlov Fund, c/o Charles Lenore, Esq, Day Pitney LLP, 242 Trumbull St., Hartford, CT 06103."

2014-09-27T00:00:00Z,"ROOB--Rona, 75, died peacefully in Manhattan on September 26 after a courageous battle with cancer. Rona's life revolved around her family, the world of modern art, and a close circle of friends. She was devoted to and complemented her gentle husband of 52 years, Richard, who passed away on June 2. She enjoyed nothing more than spending time with her two daughters and their husbands--Nancy Roob and Lukas Weinstein, and Helen and Marc Jerome--and her five grandchildren: Hanna, Ella, Sophie, Lucy and Sam. Born in New York City, Rona graduated from Barnard College, majoring in Art History, and later earned a Master's in Library Science at Columbia University. She had a life-long love of modern art, and the Museum of Modern Art was her second family. She first worked at MoMA in the 1960s, as secretary to Alfred H. Barr, then Director of the Museum Collections. Barr and his wife, Marga, profoundly influenced her life. She was named Chief Archivist in 1996, and upon her retirement in 1998, the position of Rona Roob Senior Museum Archivist was established. Rona embodied the archives: She was passionate about preserving MoMA's institutional history, loved facts and details, and had an extraordinary capacity to organize and retain large amounts of information. She made many presentations and wrote numerous articles, including ""A Noble Legacy,"" considered the definitive article on MoMA co-founder Lillie Bliss, ""1936: The Museum Selects an Architect,"" and ""The Rockefeller Vision and the Making of the Museum of Modern Art."" Rona was a trustee emerita of the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, and a member of MoMA's Trustee Committee on Archives, Library and Research, the advisory committee of the Frick Museum, and the board of trustees of Guild Hall. Her family and friends greatly mourn her loss. Funeral services will be private. Notes of sympathy may be sent to the Family of Rona Roob at her home address. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Rona Roob Archives Fund at MoMA."

2014-09-28T00:00:00Z,"ROOB--Rona. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the loss of Rona Roob. Rona first worked at the Museum in the 1960s, assisting Alfred H. Barr, Jr. in the Department of Museum Collections. She left in 1965, then returned in the 1980s, first as a researcher and then to work on the institution's archives. The Museum Archives was formally established as a separate department in 1989, with Rona as the founding archivist. She was named Chief Archivist in 1996 and held that position until she retired from the Museum in 1998. Rona also supported MoMA as a member of the Museum's Trustee Committee on Archives, Library, and Research, and through her participation in The Print Associates and The Contemporary Arts Council. Rona's impact on the Museum was immeasurable. From maintaining an institutional connection for more than five decades to establishing an archives program that has become a model in its field, Rona possessed a sense of tenacity and distinct vision which was admired by all. She was tireless in her efforts to preserve and make known MoMA's complex and fascinating history, and she conceived, designed, and established The Museum of Modern Art Archives and Records Management Program. She was generous in sharing her knowledge and helped guide countless curators and scholars through the wealth of documentation housed in the MoMA Archives. The depth of her knowledge, and her dedication to MoMA, was astounding. She was known for her uncanny ability to automatically recall myriad facts and stories, solely from memory. We extend our deepest sympathies to her daughters Nancy Roob and Helen Jerome and their families. The Board of Trustees of The Museum of Modern Art"
2014-09-28T00:00:00Z,"ROOB--Rona, 75, died peacefully in Manhattan on September 26 after a courageous battle with cancer. Rona's life revolved around her family, the world of modern art, and a close circle of friends. She was devoted to and complemented her gentle husband of 52 years, Richard, who passed away on June 2. She enjoyed nothing more than spending time with her two daughters and their husbands--Nancy Roob and Lukas Weinstein, and Helen and Marc Jerome--and her five grandchildren: Hanna, Ella, Sophie, Lucy and Sam. Born in New York City, Rona graduated from Barnard College, majoring in Art History, and later earned a Master's in Library Science at Columbia University. She had a life-long love of modern art, and The Museum of Modern Art was her second family. She first worked at MoMA in the 1960s, as secretary to Alfred H. Barr, then Director of the Museum Collections. Barr and his wife, Marga, profoundly influenced her life. In the 1980's Rona helped to build The Museum of Modern Art Archives Records Management Program, which was formerly established as a separate department in 1989 with Rona as the founding Archivist. She was named Chief Archivist in 1996, and upon her retirement in 1998, the position of Rona Roob Museum Archivist was established. Rona embodied the archives: She was passionate about preserving MoMA's institutional history, loved facts and details, and had an extraordinary capacity to organize and retain large amounts of information. She made many presentations and wrote numerous articles, including ""A Noble Legacy,"" considered the definitive article on MoMA co-founder Lillie Bliss, ""1936: The Museum Selects an Architect,"" and ""The Rockefeller Vision and the Making of The Museum of Modern Art."" Rona was a trustee emerita of the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, and a member of MoMA's Trustee Committee on Archives, Library and Research, the Advisory Committee of the Frick Center for the History of Collecting, and the board of trustees of Guild Hall. She was also a member of the Century Association and Cosmopolitan Club. Her family and friends greatly mourn her loss. Funeral services will be private. Notes of sympathy may be sent to the Family of Rona Roob at her home address. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Rona Roob Archives Fund at MoMA."

At the time of his retirement in 1997, he held the New Jersey record for most career wins in high school boys' basketball and remains in the top ten today. Oke was inducted into many associations' Halls of Fame, including the New Jersey Scholastic Coaches Association, the New Jersey Sportswriters Association and that of Rutgers Prep. After his retirement, Oke and Pegeen, his wife of 57 years, assumed the roles of Rutgers Prep ambassadors, re-uniting with his former students and players and sharing the milestones of RPS graduates at their homes all over the country.

2014-09-28T00:00:00Z,"KRISHNA--Kumar. Entomologist and world authority on termites - a group of some 3,100 species of singular ecological significance - died on September 19 in his home in Manhattan after triumphing over multiple cancers for 15 years. He was 86. Dr. Krishna spent 34 years as Professor at the City College of New York and 52 years as a Research Associate at the American Museum of Natural History, where he was steward to the Museum's monumental termite collection of over one million specimens. He served as Chairman of the Graduate Program in Biology at City College, among other administrative positions. During that tenure, he also helped develop a formal program in graduate research training between City College and the Museum, which produced many notable biologists and continues to thrive. His greatest pleasure, however, was being on the 5th floor of the Museum working on papers that would eventually re-define the diversity and evolutionary history of the most social of all insects. Dr. Krishna graduated from the University of Chicago under the eminent biologist Alfred E. Emerson, who had a transformative effect on the nascent entomologist. Over the years, Dr. Krishna greatly expanded Emerson's collection, spending many months in the forests of Sri Lanka, South India, Malaysia, and Indonesia, searching out and observing termites, making the collection on Central Park West into the largest and most comprehensive in the world. Dr. Krishna retired from City College in 1996 and focused on research for the next 18 years. A special interest was termites fossilized in amber, revealing, for example, that termites formed nature's original societies probably more than 130 million years ago, well before ants. Dr. Krishna's main post-retirement research was his magnum opus on the world's termites. On April 25, 2013, the 7-volume, 2704-page ""Treatise on the Isoptera of the World"" was published, one of the largest projects ever done in the 144-year history of the AMNH, and the most comprehensive single study done on any group of social insects. Into his 80's, he and his wife Valerie often spent late evenings at the museum working on the ""Treatise"", like graduate students again. Dr. Krishna broke the mold of the academic persona, always handsomely attired, delighting in classical music and fine food and wine. He was jovial, enthusiastic, generous, and highly encouraging to students and young faculty. Dr. Krishna was a member of the Linnean Society of London and the Oriental Club, London; there are 14 species and genera of insects named after him. In 2011, a 324-page Festschrift volume was published in his honor. Kumar Krishna was born 21 June 1928 in Rangoon, then part of British India; he grew up in Dehra Dun, in the foothills of the Indian Himalayas. His father was a physician and one of the first Indians to serve in the British Army as a major in WWI. Young Kumar received his B.Sc. from Agra University in 1950 and his M.Sc. from Lucknow University in 1952. He met his wife, Valerie Smith, while studying for his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago from 1955 to 1961. When they moved to New York Valerie took a position as Professor of English at City College, simultaneously studying for her Ph.D. at New York University. She is a noted scholar on Arthurian literature and Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"". Besides his devoted and loving wife Valerie, Dr. Krishna is survived by two sisters, Veena Puri of Adelaide, Australia, and Dr. Prabha Prakash of White Plains, by ten nieces and nephews, and many friends and admiring colleagues."

2014-09-28T00:00:00Z,"CARTER--John Mack. John Mack Carter, the storied magazine editor who headed the nation's top three women's magazines, including a 20-year stint at Good Housekeeping, died September 26, 2014 at his home in Bronxville, NY, after a lengthy battle with Parkinson's disease. He was 86 years old. Carter spent six decades in magazines and was the editor who shaped a new agenda for women's magazines in the pre-feminist era. He edited McCall's, then Ladies' Home Journal and ultimately Good Housekeeping--the top women's titles at the time--and is the only person in publishing history to have headed all three. In the early 1970s, a group of women stormed Carter's office at Ladies' Home Journal, holding him hostage for 11 hours as they demanded and negotiated changes in the magazine. The event garnered national media attention and Carter responded by taking magazines in a direction that reflected women's changing roles and needs. ""There was more discrimination than I thought,: he later said. ""I didn't push our women readers far enough in their self-awareness."" In another interview he stated, ""Power is the big issue that divides men and women. Men hold power, women want power, but men are reluctant to give it--any of it--away."" His magazines reflected his ever-evolving consciousness and remained an advocate for women for the rest of his career, speaking out on issues ranging from equal rights to sexual harassment. ""John Mack Carter was a giant in our industry,"" said Steven R. Swartz, president and CEO, Hearst Corporation. For decades he led some of this country's most widely read magazines, he mentored a generation of writers and editors, and his hugely successful Good Housekeeping helped fuel the growth of today's Hearst Corporation."" ""John Mack Carter was one of the most successful and influential editors of his time,"" said William R. Hearst III, chairman of the board, Hearst Corporation. ""He was a leader in every aspect of the business and he will be missed by the entire Hearst family."" ""When John Mack became editor of Good Housekeeping, he faced a formidable challenge of invigorating the magazine without alienating its loyal core readers,"" said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., executive vice chairman and former CEO, Hearst Corporation. ""Along with modernizing its content, he had a solution in 1975 that is today's industry standard: Put celebrities on the cover. The idea was revolutionary at the time and massive, immediate circulation growth followed. His vision and leadership played an important role in the growth of this company. We will all miss John Mack's unparalleled passion--and most of all, his friendship."" ""After leading Good Housekeeping to unprecedented success, John Mack Carter went on to generate future magazine growth at Hearst by inspiring the launch of new titles,"" said Gilbert C. Maurer, director and former COO, Hearst Corporation. ""Over the years, so much of what I came to recognize as the standards for great magazine publishing I learned from John. His knack for perceiving unfilled needs in the marketplace was uncanny. And no one ever wrote a better cover line."" A Murray, KY, native who attended Murray State University before transferring to the University of Missouri where he earned his master's in journalism in 1949, Carter remained loyal to his roots. He received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Murray State University in 1971. Advertising Age once dubbed Carter the ""bluegrass evangelist,"" yet he was the consummate New York media luminary, working on more than a dozen established magazines. When Carter left Good Housekeeping in 1994, he helped to conceive and launch new titles for Hearst as president of Hearst Magazines Enterprises. Carter played a pivotal role in launching Country Living, Victoria, SmartMoney and Marie Claire, among other titles. Carter came to Hearst in 1975 from American Home Publishing Company where he was chairman and editor in chief of American Home magazine. Under his leadership at Good Housekeeping from 1975 to 1994, the magazine won two National Magazine Awards. In 1989, Carter received the Henry Johnson Fisher Award from MPA The Association of Magazine Media and in 2000, he was inducted into the American Society of Magazine Editors' Hall of Fame. In addition to his editorial and executive duties, Carter wrote a monthly column on magazines for Adweek for nine years. He hosted the cable television program, Good Housekeeping: A Better Way. He also found time to author and co-author a number of books, including 1975's How to Be Outrageously Successful with Women: A Guide to Surviving the Sexual Revolution, with Lois Wyse, and The Good Housekeeping Illustrated Book of Pregnancy and Baby Care (1990). While still in high school, Carter became a reporter for the Murray Ledger & Times, where he continued to contribute until he completed his graduate degree. He was offered $50 a week by Better Homes and Gardens to be an assistant editor, his first foray into women's magazines. He left Better Homes and Gardens for a commission as an ensign in the U.S. Navy and served two tours during the Korean War on the minesweeper U.S.S. Toucan before being honorably discharged as a lieutenant. Carter then took a job as managing editor at Household Magazine in Topeka, Kan., before heading to his ultimate destination of New York City. A Bronxville, N.Y., resident for 47 years, Carter is survived by his wife of 66 years, Sharlyn Reaves Carter; his children, Jonna Carter and John Mack Carter II; son-in-law John R. Low; daughter-in-law Victoria Carter; and four grandchildren, John Mack Carter III, Christina Victoria Carter, Kathleen Elizabeth Carter Low and Christopher Ryan Carter Low. He is also survived by his twin sister, Carolyn Carter Reagan; brother-in-law Johnny Reagan; nieces Jan Reagan Fuqua and Lyn Reagan Ryan; and nephews Danny Grant, David Grant, Dean Grant and Donald Grant.

2014-09-29T00:00:00Z,"ROOB--Rona. It is with profound sorrow that we mourn the loss of former Museum of Modern Art colleague and dear friend, Rona Roob. Rona's abiding love for the Museum went back to the 1960s when she began working for MoMA's first director, Alfred Barr. Her devotion and commitment to the Museum found permanent expression with the establishment of the Museum Archives in 1989 which she directed until her retirement in 1998. Rona's knowledge of the Museum was unparalleled. She could recall historic details about MoMA's artworks, people and events with uncanny accuracy and was a tireless champion for the preservation of MoMA's legacy, as her many publications attest. Rona had tremendous energy and verve, and always demonstrated unstinting loyalty to MoMA along with a passion for modern art. Her love for her family and her generosity to friends was deeply felt. To her daughters Nancy and Helen and their families, we send our heartfelt sympathy. Agnes Gund and Karen Davidson"
2014-09-29T00:00:00Z,"ROOB--Rona, 75, died peacefully in Manhattan on September 26 after a courageous battle with cancer. Rona's life revolved around her family, the world of modern art, and a close circle of friends. She was devoted to and complemented her gentle husband of 52 years, Richard, who passed away on June 2. She enjoyed nothing more than spending time with her two daughters and their husbands--Nancy Roob and Lukas Weinstein, and Helen and Marc Jerome--and her five grandchildren: Hanna, Ella, Sophie, Lucy and Sam. Born in New York City, Rona graduated from Barnard College, majoring in Art History, and later earned a Master's in Library Science at Columbia University. She had a life-long love of modern art, and The Museum of Modern Art was her second family. She first worked at MoMA in the 1960s, as secretary to Alfred H. Barr, then Director of the Museum Collections. Barr and his wife, Marga, profoundly influenced her life. In the 1980's Rona helped to build The Museum of Modern Art Archives Records Management Program, which was formerly established as a separate department in 1989 with Rona as the founding Archivist. She was named Chief Archivist in 1996, and upon her retirement in 1998, the position of Rona Roob Museum Archivist was established. Rona embodied the archives: She was passionate about preserving MoMA's institutional history, loved facts and details, and had an extraordinary capacity to organize and retain large amounts of information. She made many presentations and wrote numerous articles, including ""A Noble Legacy,"" considered the definitive article on MoMA co-founder Lillie Bliss, ""1936: The Museum Selects an Architect,"" and ""The Rockefeller Vision and the Making of The Museum of Modern Art."" Rona was a trustee emerita of the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, and a member of MoMA's Trustee Committee on Archives, Library and Research, the Advisory Committee of the Frick Center for the History of Collecting, and the board of trustees of Guild Hall. She was also a member of the Century Association and Cosmopolitan Club. Her family and friends greatly mourn her loss. Funeral services will be private. Notes of sympathy may be sent to the Family of Rona Roob at her home address. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Rona Roob Archives Fund at MoMA."

She is survived by her loving sister, the Honorable Carolyn Dineen King, of the 5th Circuit United States Court of Appeals, and devoted brother, Robert E.

She was one of the founders of the Matthew 25 Project, an organization established to assist the elderly in Sherman, CT.

Kaufman: His Life, His Theater,"" a biography a New York Times reviewer called ""an admirable accomplishment."" Dr. Goldstein's other passion was art. His sharp and judicious eye enabled him to amass on a limited budget an impressive collection of contemporary drawings and prints that included works by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenberg, Sherrie Levine, Susan Rothenberg and Chuck Close. A devoted member of the Century Association, he also collected and on one occasion exhibited prints by members of the club. His final book, appropriately, was ""Landscape with Figures: A History of Art Dealing in the United States.""

2014-10-08T00:00:00Z,"KARLEN--Roland Newton. Beat Generation playwright, elder statesman of AM radio ad men, and life-long New York mensch Roland Newton Karlen died, in acceptance of the inevitable, at his home on September 20 at age 87. Raised during the Depression by a Zionist Socialist father and a kosher-keeping mother who nevertheless made him bacon sandwiches ""for his health"", Rolly was of the opinion that his childhood in Morningside Heights was nearly perfect. In addition to the hide-and-seek games at Grant's Tomb, Boy Scouts on 103rd Street, and playing stickball on Riverside Drive, there was an after-school job at the 57th Street Cafeteria owned by his uncle, Atlantic City turf accountant Willie ""Wallpaper"" Kanowitz. Rolly's only significant absence from his beloved New York came at the end of WWII courtesy of the U. S. Army draft. The G. I. Bill equipped Rolly with a bachelor's degree in English from Hunter College and a calling. The starving playwright co-founded Newton Advertising, giving New Yorkers of a certain age a Castro Convertible jingle they can never, ever get out of their heads. Later, upon achieving independent success as a one-man ad agency (which continues today as Karlen Williams Graybill), Rolly became the Karlen family's greatest benefactor, supporting distantly related scholars, undiscovered artists, free spirits, and genial ne'er-do-wells. In his retirement, Rolly had several professional readings of his early plays, which dealt with Freudian theories of self and time travel. Another milestone in the happy history of Rolly's life on Earth occurred on October 16, 2013 when, at age 86, he walked across the Brooklyn Bridge for the first time in his life. The trek would have taken half as long if he hadn't stopped every few minutes to pronounce that this view, or the one a few paces further, was the most terrific, most beautiful view of New York, of civilization, or of humanity that he'd ever seen. Rolly is survived by a legion of family and friends who have to figure out how to live in a world without him."

We will miss him. Barry Curtiss-Lusher, National Chair Abraham H. Foxman, National Director"
2014-10-08T00:00:00Z,"GOLDMAN--Ralph. The World Jewish Congress family joins the international Jewish community in mourning the passing of Ralph Goldman, the long-time extraordinary leader of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, whose tenure covered historic times, most notably gaining JDC access to Jewish communities behind the iron curtain as well as to Soviet Jewry. He had a lifelong commitment to serving the Jewish people. A proud Zionist, appointed by Ben Gurion as his liaison appointee to the American Jewish community, Ralph was deeply dedicated to the success of Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people and played a key role in its establishment during the war of independence. We will ever be inspired by his life's work. May his family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Ronald S. Lauder, President Robert Singer, CEO"

2014-10-08T00:00:00Z,"GOLDMAN--Ralph. The Officers, Board of Directors, and worldwide staff of The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) mourn with great sadness the passing of our esteemed Honorary Executive Vice President and senior advisor, Ralph I. Goldman. A legendary figure who dedicated his long and illustrious career to serving Israel and the Jewish people, Ralph has been a keystone of our organization for over four decades and an iconic symbol of international Jewish communal service. Born in Ukraine on September 1, 1914, the same year that JDC was founded in New York, Ralph celebrated his 100th birthday with us this year and was still working for JDC at his death in Israel on October 7. Ralph served two terms and a total of 11 years as JDC's Executive Vice President (1976-85; 1986-88), orchestrating our reentry into most of Eastern Europe and what was then still the Soviet Union, and seizing every opportunity to jumpstart a revitalization of Jewish life throughout the former Communist bloc. The life-sustaining assistance and Jewish connections provided today to that region's million+ Jews through 161 JDC-supported Hesed welfare centers, some 200 Jewish community centers, and hundreds of Jewish learning opportunities are a testament to his vision and pioneering efforts, as are the leadership training and regional initiatives that he launched or inspired in Latin America and Europe and the ties he solidified with more isolated Jewish communities in North Africa and India. Prior to his association with JDC, Ralph was an early builder of the State of Israel, engaging in pivotal events in the pre-State years and becoming a senior aide and trusted advisor to Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, a life-long confidant of Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek, and a moving force in the establishment of Israel's community centers and other social, cultural, and educational institutions that continue to enrich life there and throughout the Jewish world. Ralph viewed Israel as the ""fulcrum"" for JDC's global operations, with a pivotal role to play in what he firmly believed was ""a single, intertwined Jewish world."" As JDC's Associate Director-General in Israel from 1968-76, Ralph oversaw a reorganization of operations, the relocation of JDC headquarters from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and the establishment of an association--in partnership with the government--responsible for the development of comprehensive, innovative services for seniors. Ralph helped found and shape two social research institutes in Israel that have gained international renown, and he pioneered JDC's role as an effective instrument of the world Jewish community in responding to global disasters and supporting development needs. The recipient of numerous honorary degrees and awards, including the French Legion of Honor, Ralph seemed proudest of the Ralph I. Goldman Fellowship established by our Board in 1987, and he eagerly mentored a new generation of communal leaders. Ralph was predeceased by his beloved wife, Helen, and by his son, David Ben-Rafael, a senior Israeli diplomat killed in the March 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Argentina. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his children: Judy and Yaakov, Naomi, and Elisa, and to the entire Goldman family. JDC's programs in 70+ countries today are Ralph's living legacy, and his indefatigable spirit will continue to inspire us for decades to come. Donations in tribute to Ralph can be made at support.jdc.org/ralphgoldman fund or by mail to: JDC; 711 Third Avenue; New York, NY 10017. May his memory be for a blessing. Penny Blumenstein President Dr. Irving A. Smokler Chairman of the Board Alan H. Gill Chief Executive Officer"

2014-10-09T00:00:00Z,"GOLDMAN--Ralph. The Officers, Board of Directors, and worldwide staff of The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) mourn with great sadness the passing of our esteemed Honorary Executive Vice President and senior advisor, Ralph I. Goldman. A legendary figure who dedicated his long and illustrious career to serving Israel and the Jewish people, Ralph has been a keystone of our organization for over four decades and an iconic symbol of international Jewish communal service. Born in Ukraine on September 1, 1914, the same year that JDC was founded in New York, Ralph celebrated his 100th birthday with us this year and was still working for JDC at his death in Israel on October 7. Ralph served two terms and a total of 11 years as JDC's Executive Vice President (1976-85; 1986-88), orchestrating our reentry into most of Eastern Europe and what was then still the Soviet Union, and seizing every opportunity to jumpstart a revitalization of Jewish life throughout the former Communist bloc. The life-sustaining assistance and Jewish connections provided today to that region's million+ Jews through 161 JDC-supported Hesed welfare centers, some 200 Jewish community centers, and hundreds of Jewish learning opportunities are a testament to his vision and pioneering efforts, as are the leadership training and regional initiatives that he launched or inspired in Latin America and Europe and the ties he solidified with more isolated Jewish communities in North Africa and India. Prior to his association with JDC, Ralph was an early builder of the State of Israel, engaging in pivotal events in the pre-State years and becoming a senior aide and trusted advisor to Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, a life-long confidant of Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek, and a moving force in the establishment of Israel's community centers and other social, cultural, and educational institutions that continue to enrich life there and throughout the Jewish world. Ralph viewed Israel as the ""fulcrum"" for JDC's global operations, with a pivotal role to play in what he firmly believed was ""a single, intertwined Jewish world."" As JDC's Associate Director-General in Israel from 1968-76, Ralph oversaw a reorganization of operations, the relocation of JDC headquarters from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and the establishment of an association--in partnership with the government--responsible for the development of comprehensive, innovative services for seniors. Ralph helped found and shape two social research institutes in Israel that have gained international renown, and he pioneered JDC's role as an effective instrument of the world Jewish community in responding to global disasters and supporting development needs. The recipient of numerous honorary degrees and awards, including the French Legion of Honor, Ralph seemed proudest of the Ralph I. Goldman Fellowship established by our Board in 1987, and he eagerly mentored a new generation of communal leaders. Ralph was predeceased by his beloved wife, Helen, and by his son, David Ben-Rafael, a senior Israeli diplomat killed in the March 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Argentina. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his children: Judy and Yaakov, Naomi, and Elisa, and to the entire Goldman family. JDC's programs in 70+ countries today are Ralph's living legacy, and his indefatigable spirit will continue to inspire us for decades to come. Donations in tribute to Ralph can be made at support.jdc.org/ralphgoldman fund or by mail to: JDC; 711 Third Avenue; New York, NY 10017. May his memory be for a blessing.

Those who knew Mr. La Vea well know that nothing gave him more pride and joy than his philanthropic work. With a deep belief that children are our future leaders, he tirelessly supported children's causes, including those established to combat childhood hunger and disease, as well as those that provide for civic education and leadership. Mr. La Vea also believed that there is a strong link between the way we treat animals and the way we treat each other.

2014-10-10T00:00:00Z,"SIEGEL--David Donald, Died on October 9th, at his home in North Egremont, MA, after a series of health problems. He was born on October 18th, 1931, in Brooklyn, NY. David attended New York City public schools and was a bright but unmotivated student at Brooklyn College, where he majored in Romance Languages. He received a draft notice on the day of the Korean War armistice, and served his country for two years in Stuttgart, Germany, translating French documents. David described his peacetime military service as a turning point in his life. After returning home, he enrolled at St. John's University Law School, where he graduated at the top of the class of 1958. In 1962 the New York State Legislature enacted the Civil Practice Law and Rules, which reorganized the law of New York civil ligation. David quickly found his professional niche. He transformed arcane subjects with clarity, concision, and, most remarkably, humor. The bench and bar came to rely on his writings as indispensable to the practice of law. In the years that followed, he was in wide demand as a lecturer and expert in the areas of New York Civil Procedure, Conflict of Laws, and Federal Jurisdiction. David's premier publication was his treatise, New York Practice, which has been the definitive text on New York civil procedure from its original publication in 1978 until today, now in its fifth edition. He brought meticulous scholarship and lucidity to all his writing, including the Bar Association's New York State Law Digest and his own Siegel's Practice Review, which he first published in 1993. David edited the former for thirty-seven years, and the latter from 1993 to 2014. His practice commentaries for McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York have been cited by the United States Supreme Court and have been extensively relied on by New York courts, including more than 250 citations by the Court of Appeals. He served as Professor of Law at Albany Law School from 1972 until his retirement as Distinguished Professor in 2007. David also taught at St. John's University, and was a visiting professor at New York University and Cornell University Law Schools. At Albany Law, he created a scholarship fund for Law Review students, which has provided financial support for 126 students to date. David was a revered mentor to scores of students and lawyers, as well as family members and friends. David was renowned for his quick wit, infectious sense of fun, and generous soul, all of which were in full force until his final hours. David is survived by his wife of nearly 45 years, Rosemarie Duffy Siegel, and two daughters, Sheela Clary of West Stockbridge and Rachel Siegel of Great Barrington. His five grandchildren, Cecelia, Fiona, George, Donal and Patrick were the lights of his later life. He was predeceased by his father, Harry Siegel, in 1976, and his mother, Ida Scharaga Siegel, in 1980. An interfaith memorial service will be held at St. James Church in Chatham, NY, at 1pm on October 19th. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to Albany Law School Law Review, in Memory of Professor David D. Siegel."

2014-10-10T00:00:00Z,"GREENBERG--Eulalia Beloved mother, grandmother, sister, aunt and friend passed away peacefully on September 28, 2014. Eulalia (aka Lali and YaYa) lived an admirably happy and full life, with accomplishments that were far ahead of her time. Born on May 26, 1933 to Pere Virgili Fortuny and Eulalia Elias Virgili in Esparreguera, Spain, Eulalia was one of a handful of women to graduate from Barcelona University School of Law in 1957. She became Spain's first female Fulbright Scholar, for which she was awarded a fellowship to Luxembourg School of Comparative Law in 1958. There, she met her future husband, Michael H. Greenberg, who was studying law at Harvard University. The following year, she received a grant to further study international comparative law at New York University, where she earned a Masters. Eulalia and Michael were married on June 11, 1960, and moved to Michael's hometown of Brooklyn. After the birth of their two sons, Peter and Edward, they moved to Freeport, Long Island and then to Baldwin, where their children grew up, and later to Great Neck when Peter and Edward were away in college. Eulalia dedicated herself to raising their children while her husband pursued his illustrious law career. She also worked part-time doing Spanish-English legal translations, simultaneous court translation, and taught Adult Education English as a second language. After their sons were grown and living in Manhattan, Eulalia and Michael moved to the Upper East Side of Manhattan. There Eulalia filled her life with her passions, such as spoiling her grandchildren, hostessing her signature Paella parties, engaging in Catalan cultural events, and watching many different types of sporting events. Eulalia loved taking long strolls in Central Park, and going to Broadway shows, Lincoln Center, and Manhattan's many museums and restaurants. She enjoyed traveling frequently with her children and grandchildren on family vacations, and to visit her family in Barcelona and the surrounding towns in Catalonia, Spain. After her husband of 47 years passed away in 2008, Eulalia recovered from her loss and continued to live a vibrant and independent life, always determined to learn and adapt to the changing world. Until her final days, she stayed in touch with her friends and family in both the U.S. and Spain with daily emails and text messages. Eulalia will be forever remembered for her beauty - both inside and out, her selfless dedication to her family, her cosmopolitan elegance, strong will, fun and loving spirit, and unfaltering kindness. She will be especially missed by her adoring sons, Peter and Edward; her daughters-in-law, Carolina and Kate; and her grandchildren, Lauren, Nicky, Jordan, Emily and Isabella. Eulalia also leaves behind her family in Spain, including her loving brother, Jose Maria, sister-in-law, Luisa, and their children and grandchildren. A gathering to celebrate Eulalia's life will be held at her apartment (239 E. 79th St., Apt. 13P) on Saturday, October 11 from 2:00pm to 6:00pm. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Catalan Institute of America catalaninstituteofamerica.org."

2014-10-11T00:00:00Z,"PEYSER--Peter A.,former Member of Congress from Westchester, Rockland and The Bronx and former Mayor of Irvington, died on October 9 at his home in Irvington. He was 93 years old. Mr. Peyser was first elected to Congress in 1970 as a Republican. He filled the vacancy left by Richard L. Ottinger (D), who left his House seat to pursue a run for the Senate. In 1972, Peyser fought off Ottinger's comeback attempt in one of the most hard-fought House elections of its time in New York. When Ottinger returned to Congress in 1974 from a neighboring district, the two became close collaborators on behalf of Westchester. In 1976, Peyser attempted to unseat Senator James L. Buckley (C) in a statewide GOP primary. His quixotic campaign ended in defeat. In 1977, Peyser announced he had become a Democrat. In 1978, he ran for his old congressional seat as a Democrat and won. He was re-elected in 1980. In 1982, redistricting eliminated his seat and forced him to run against popular Congressman Ben Gilman (R) in a district highly favorable to Gilman. Mr. Gilman won that race and Peyser departed the Congress on January 3, 1983. During his decades of public service, he always focused on trying to make government work for people. Quality education and good, family wage jobs were issues to which he applied his abundant energy. In addition to his service in Congress from 1971-1977 and 1979-1983 and as Irvington Mayor from 1962-1970, Mr. Peyser served as President of the Irvington PTA, on the Board of Trustees of his beloved Colgate University, on the Vestry of St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Irvington and on the Board of Trustees of Children's Village. Mr. Peyser was born in Cedarhurst, Long Island on September 7, 1921. He graduated from the Dwight School in Manhattan and went on to Colgate University. He was in the class of 1943, but his class accelerated their studies so they could graduate in December of 1942 and enter the armed forces. He served in the Army infantry in World War II and saw action in major European theater battles such as the Battle of the Bulge, Hurtgen Forest, Remagen Bridge engagement and others. After returning home, he served in the National Guard as a Captain in the 7th Regiment. Mr. Peyser worked in the insurance industry after the war, eventually running his own agency of the Mutual of New York company. When his congressional career ended in 1983, he started a new career in the financial sector and at the end of his life was still working for the Gabelli Asset Management Company. He and the Peyser family have been most grateful to the company's founder Mario Gabelli for his support and friendship. Mr. Peyser is survived by his wife of 64 years, the former Marguerite Richards and his five children: Penny of Woodland Hills, CA; Safi Abheeti of Novato, CA; Peter of New York City; Jim of Milton, MA, and Tom of Richmond, VA. All of the Peyser children graduated from Irvington High School. He is also survived by five grandchildren. His passing leaves a void for all of his family that can never be filled. The public is invited to a viewing on Sunday, October 12 from 2pm to 5pm at the Edwards-Dowdle Funeral Home in Dobbs Ferry, NY and to the funeral service on Monday, October 13 at 3pm at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Irvington, NY.

Marianne and her twin brother were born in Munich, Germany in 1920. Marianne and her brother witnessed Hitler and the early stages of Nazism rising in Germany. Their parents, Ernst and Marta Wilmersdoerffer, died of illness in 1929 and 1931. Marianne's brother went to England and Marianne was sent to the International School of Geneva. After graduating in 1941, she attended the University of Geneva, studying biology. She left before completing her studies to marry Orazio Frugoni and after a few more years in Europe, they both immigrated to New York in 1949. Friends have described Marianne as a force of nature. When she was a young woman in Switzerland, her nickname was ""La Bise,"" the fierce wind that blows off Lake Geneva. Her comments could be acerbic, and her observations astute. She spoke her mind and the truth as she saw it. She also won many people over with her charm, intelligence, elegance and concern. She had many friends who were very important to her. She was a most considerate traveler and guest. Marianne always appreciated beauty. She loved classical music and opera and attended many cultural events. At home the radio was always on with classical music. She and her second husband, Paul Gourary, created a beautiful home in Manhattan that was filled with art and books where she hosted many fine dinners for friends. Marianne spent many summers in Provincetown where she loved to take a daily swim in the bay. Time spent there with family and friends was a source of joy and relaxation. She was a resolute and devoted mother who was very proud of her daughter Corinne and her son John. She had a strong affection for cats and especially appreciated their company during the later years of her life. She was curious, researching and collecting books on many subjects. She was proud to be a citizen of the United States, a Democrat and a New Yorker. As she weakened during the last year of her life, she found great pleasure in the beauty of the trees and flowers in Central Park. Marianne leaves behind her daughter, Corinne Frugoni, her son John Gourary, his wife and children, Jennifer, Justin and Julia, her sister-in-law and nephew and nieces in England, June Wilmers, Peter Wilmers, Catherine Wilmers and Brigit Wilmers, their partners, Carol, Graham, David, along with their children and childrens' children.

2014-10-12T00:00:00Z,"SIEGEL--David Donald, Died on October 9th, at his home in North Egremont, MA, after a series of health problems. He was born on October 18th, 1931, in Brooklyn, NY. David attended New York City public schools and was a bright but unmotivated student at Brooklyn College, where he majored in Romance Languages. He received a draft notice on the day of the Korean War armistice, and served his country for two years in Stuttgart, Germany, translating French documents. David described his peacetime military service as a turning point in his life. After returning home, he enrolled at St. John's University Law School, where he graduated at the top of the class of 1958. In 1962 the New York State Legislature enacted the Civil Practice Law and Rules, which reorganized the law of New York civil ligation. David quickly found his professional niche. He transformed arcane subjects with clarity, concision, and, most remarkably, humor. The bench and bar came to rely on his writings as indispensable to the practice of law. In the years that followed, he was in wide demand as a lecturer and expert in the areas of New York Civil Procedure, Conflict of Laws, and Federal Jurisdiction. David's premier publication was his treatise, New York Practice, which has been the definitive text on New York civil procedure from its original publication in 1978 until today, now in its fifth edition. He brought meticulous scholarship and lucidity to all his writing, including the Bar Association's New York State Law Digest and his own Siegel's Practice Review, which he first published in 1993. David edited the former for thirty-seven years, and the latter from 1993 to 2014. His practice commentaries for McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York have been cited by the United States Supreme Court and have been extensively relied on by New York courts, including more than 250 citations by the Court of Appeals. He served as Professor of Law at Albany Law School from 1972 until his retirement as Distinguished Professor in 2007. David also taught at St. John's University, and was a visiting professor at New York University and Cornell University Law Schools. At Albany Law, he created a scholarship fund for Law Review students, which has provided financial support for 126 students to date. David was a revered mentor to scores of students and lawyers, as well as family members and friends. David was renowned for his quick wit, infectious sense of fun, and generous soul, all of which were in full force until his final hours. David is survived by his wife of nearly 45 years, Rosemarie Duffy Siegel, and two daughters, Sheela Clary of West Stockbridge and Rachel Siegel of Great Barrington. His five grandchildren, Cecelia, Fiona, George, Donal and Patrick were the lights of his later life. He was predeceased by his father, Harry Siegel, in 1976, and his mother, Ida Scharaga Siegel, in 1980. An interfaith memorial service will be held at St. James Church in Chatham, NY, at 1pm on October 19th.

2014-10-12T00:00:00Z,"PEYSER--Peter A.,former Member of Congress from Westchester, Rockland and The Bronx and former Mayor of Irvington, died on October 9 at his home in Irvington. He was 93 years old. Mr. Peyser was first elected to Congress in 1970 as a Republican. He filled the vacancy left by Richard L. Ottinger (D), who left his House seat to pursue a run for the Senate. In 1972, Peyser fought off Ottinger's comeback attempt in one of the most hard-fought House elections of its time in New York. When Ottinger returned to Congress in 1974 from a neighboring district, the two became close collaborators on behalf of Westchester. In 1976, Peyser attempted to unseat Senator James L. Buckley (C) in a statewide GOP primary. His quixotic campaign ended in defeat. In 1977, Peyser announced he had become a Democrat. In 1978, he ran for his old congressional seat as a Democrat and won. He was re-elected in 1980. In 1982, redistricting eliminated his seat and forced him to run against popular Congressman Ben Gilman (R) in a district highly favorable to Gilman. Mr. Gilman won that race and Peyser departed the Congress on January 3, 1983. During his decades of public service, he always focused on trying to make government work for people. Quality education and good, family wage jobs were issues to which he applied his abundant energy. In addition to his service in Congress from 1971-1977 and 1979-1983 and as Irvington Mayor from 1962-1970, Mr. Peyser served as President of the Irvington PTA, on the Board of Trustees of his beloved Colgate University, on the Vestry of St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Irvington and on the Board of Trustees of Children's Village. Mr. Peyser was born in Cedarhurst, Long Island on September 7, 1921. He graduated from the Dwight School in Manhattan and went on to Colgate University. He was in the class of 1943, but his class accelerated their studies so they could graduate in December of 1942 and enter the armed forces. He served in the Army infantry in World War II and saw action in major European theater battles such as the Battle of the Bulge, Hurtgen Forest, Remagen Bridge engagement and others. After returning home, he served in the National Guard as a Captain in the 7th Regiment. Mr. Peyser worked in the insurance industry after the war, eventually running his own agency of the Mutual of New York company. When his congressional career ended in 1983, he started a new career in the financial sector and at the end of his life was still working for the Gabelli Asset Management Company. He and the Peyser family have been most grateful to the company's founder Mario Gabelli for his support and friendship. Mr. Peyser is survived by his wife of 64 years, the former Marguerite Richards and his five children: Penny of Woodland Hills, CA; Safi Abheeti of Novato, CA; Peter of New York City; Jim of Milton, MA, and Tom of Richmond, VA. All of the Peyser children graduated from Irvington High School. He is also survived by five grandchildren. His passing leaves a void for all of his family that can never be filled. The public is invited to a viewing on Sunday, October 12 from 2pm to 5pm at the Edwards-Dowdle Funeral Home in Dobbs Ferry, NY and to the funeral service on Monday, October 13 at 3pm at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Irvington, NY.

2014-10-12T00:00:00Z,"GOURARY--Marianne. In the late afternoon of Thursday, October 2nd, Marianne Gourary died at age 93 in her Manhattan home. Marianne and her twin brother were born in Munich, Germany in 1920. Marianne and her brother witnessed Hitler and the early stages of Nazism rising in Germany. Their parents, Ernst and Marta Wilmersdoerffer, died of illness in 1929 and 1931. Marianne's brother went to England and Marianne was sent to the International School of Geneva. After graduating in 1941, she attended the University of Geneva, studying biology. She left before completing her studies to marry Orazio Frugoni and after a few more years in Europe, they both immigrated to New York in 1949. Friends have described Marianne as a force of nature. When she was a young woman in Switzerland, her nickname was ""La Bise,"" the fierce wind that blows off Lake Geneva. Her comments could be acerbic, and her observations astute. She spoke her mind and the truth as she saw it. She also won many people over with her charm, intelligence, elegance and concern. She had many friends who were very important to her. She was a most considerate traveler and guest. Marianne always appreciated beauty. She loved classical music and opera and attended many cultural events. At home the radio was always on with classical music. She and her second husband, Paul Gourary, created a beautiful home in Manhattan that was filled with art and books where she hosted many fine dinners for friends. Marianne spent many summers in Provincetown where she loved to take a daily swim in the bay. Time spent there with family and friends was a source of joy and relaxation. She was a resolute and devoted mother who was very proud of her daughter Corinne and her son John. She had a strong affection for cats and especially appreciated their company during the later years of her life. She was curious, researching and collecting books on many subjects. She was proud to be a citizen of the United States, a Democrat and a New Yorker. As she weakened during the last year of her life, she found great pleasure in the beauty of the trees and flowers in Central Park. Marianne leaves behind her daughter, Corinne Frugoni, her son John Gourary, his wife and children, Jennifer, Justin and Julia, her sister-in-law and nephew and nieces in England, June Wilmers, Peter Wilmers, Catherine Wilmers and Brigit Wilmers, their partners, Carol, Graham, David, along with their children and childrens' children. She was preceded in death by her twin brother, John Wilmers, her first husband, Orazio Frugoni, her second husband, Paul Gourary, her first cousin Eugen Merzbacher and her nephew's son, Harry Wilmers. Gratitude is expressed to the people who enabled Marianne to live comfortably and safely in her home including Stella, Karen Glasser, the staff of 45 East 85th Street and the VNA Hospice. Donations may be sent to The Humane Society of New York City, Bide-A-Wee Pet Welfare Organization or Marianne's favorite radio station WQXR."

Kent was born in Manila, Republic of the Philippines on April 15, 1948 to Edmund Arno Schwesinger Sr. and his beloved wife, Dora Helene Axthelm Schwesinger. Kent was the youngest of their four sons. He began his academic career as a kindergartner at the notable American School in Manila. He remained a part of the American School's expatriate student body for many years before leaving to study in America. He later returned to Manila in order to graduate with his fellow school mates at Abad Santos High School.

Kent went on to become a citizen of the United States and was a resident of New York City for over forty years. Throughout his career, Kent worked for three companies with headquarters in the City. With that said, Kent's heart was in helping those in need. He was an active member of St. Peter's Lutheran Church on Lexington Avenue and 53rd Street. And it was at St. Peter's, Kent found the labor he loved. Kent was a devoted and long-time volunteer in the church's kitchen where the homeless of NYC would come for their meals. He worked wholeheartedly with humility serving each individual with dignity and a quiet grace. He leaves behind a legacy of service. Kent was preceded in death by his parents - Edmund Schwesinger Sr., a major stockholder of Benguet Exploration Gold Mine in Baguio, Philippines and Dora Helene Axthelm Schwesinger, the daughter of the Mayor of Coburg, Germany and the owner of a major manufacturer of toys with offices in both London and Germany. He is survived by his elder brothers: Edmund Jr. of Greenwich, CT - retired partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers; Davis, of Pine City, NY worldwide air gun distributor; and Henry, of Naples, Florida a broker at Merrill Lynch. As well as two cousins, Wolfgang Eckstein, the retired head of the German Fashion Union and Winfried Eckstein, an investor in commodities both of Munich, Germany. His brothers, cousins, long-time sailing comrades at Indian Harbor Yacht Club in Greenwich, CT and countless members of the NYC homeless community will sorely miss him. A memorial service will be held at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Manhattan on October 16th at noon. Pastor Armadus Derr will personally officiate the service. After interment, participants are invited to join at a nearby restaurant for lunch. Cousins Fred Forster and Wolfgang Eckstein, are traveling from Germany to attend the service."

2014-10-14T00:00:00Z,"SCHWESINGER--Kent Stanley, passed away quietly on the morning of February 28, 2012 in New York City. Kent was 64 years of age. Kent was born in Manila, Republic of the Philippines on April 15, 1948 to Edmund Arno Schwesinger Sr. and his beloved wife, Dora Helene Axthelm Schwesinger. Kent was the youngest of their four sons. He began his academic career as a kindergartner at the notable American School in Manila. He remained a part of the American School's expatriate student body for many years before leaving to study in America. He later returned to Manila in order to graduate with his fellow school mates at Abad Santos High School. Upon graduation, Kent returned to the United States to attend Maine Central Academy completing his studies in 1970. Kent went on to become a citizen of the United States and was a resident of New York City for over forty years. Throughout his career, Kent worked for three companies with headquarters in the City. With that said, Kent's heart was in helping those in need. He was an active member of St. Peter's Lutheran Church on Lexington Avenue and 53rd Street. And it was at St. Peter's, Kent found the labor he loved. Kent was a devoted and long-time volunteer in the church's kitchen where the homeless of NYC would come for their meals. He worked wholeheartedly with humility serving each individual with dignity and a quiet grace. He leaves behind a legacy of service. Kent was preceded in death by his parents - Edmund Schwesinger Sr., a major stockholder of Benguet Exploration Gold Mine in Baguio, Philippines and Dora Helene Axthelm Schwesinger, the daughter of the Mayor of Coburg, Germany and the owner of a major manufacturer of toys with offices in both London and Germany. He is survived by his elder brothers: Edmund Jr. of Greenwich, CT - retired partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers; Davis, of Pine City, NY worldwide air gun distributor; and Henry, of Naples, Florida a broker at Merrill Lynch.

The cause was congestive heart failure, complicated by pneumonia. Always proud of his graduation from DeWitt Clinton High School, Eugene attended Columbia College, where he was coxswain and Phi Beta Kappa. He went on to Columbia Law School, from which he graduated in 1935 as a James Kent Scholar. Gene practiced law for just shy of 80 years, with a brief interruption for military service during World War II. On September 17, 2014, he forthrightly announced his retirement from the law firm of Phillips Nizer LLP, where he had practiced since 1943. He was the consummate lawyers' lawyer, frequently consulted by colleagues seeking technical advice about knotty legal issues. His dedication to the law was leavened by a lifelong love of jazz, art, the ballet, and the New York Football Giants. Gene was beloved as well as respected. He was married for 70 years to the artist Harriet Kline, who died in 2010. Though predeceased by his son Robert, Gene is survived by his granddaughter Lisa and by Robert's widow, Georgann Kline Ohsman. Gene is also survived by his son Thomas and grandchildren Andrew, Emily, and Daniel. Gene was laid to rest in a private ceremony on Sunday, October 12, 2014, at Mount Carmel Cemetery.

Lester Gabrilove, MD, one of the most beloved and outstanding physicians in the history of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Dr. Gabrilove, considered one of the fathers of modern endocrinology, greatly advanced the study of endocrinology during a career that spanned more than 70 years. He co-authored ""The Human Adrenal Gland"" and ""Diseases of the Endocrine Glands;"" published more than 170 papers in national and international journals; and impacted generations of faculty and trainees. He was a role model who inspired numerous endocrine fellows and faculty who regarded him as a master clinician-educator. Dr. Gabrilove served as Chief of the Endocrine Clinic at The Mount Sinai Hospital for 20 years, and was instrumental in founding the Clinic as well as the Division of Endocrinology, where he also served as Acting Chief. In 2007, the division was renamed the Hilda and J. Lester Gabrilove Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Disease in honor of Dr. Gabrilove and his wife. In 1995, in recognition of his lifelong contributions, he received the inaugural Distinguished Endocrinologist Award by the American College of Endocrinology. His inquiring mind--he published his last paper in his nineties--combined with his passion to advance clinical care, was a gift to his patients and the School of Medicine. We extend our deepest condolences to his daughter, Janice L. Gabrilove, MD, the James F. Holland Professor of Medicine (Hematology and Medical Oncology), and Professor of Oncological Sciences, at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; his son-in-law, Michael Dirzulaitis; and his two grandsons, Mark and Matthew, of whom he was very proud.

2014-10-15T00:00:00Z,"GABRILOVE--Jacques Lester, died October 12th, in his 98th year of life: active, outgoing and engaged until the end. Lester attended Townsend Harris High School, City College, and NYU School of Medicine. He completed his internship and residency in Internal Medicine at the Mount Sinai Hospital and subsequently pursued a fellowship at Yale University. Throughout his post-graduate academic and clinical career, he was continuously affiliated with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and he remained a tireless supporter and promoter of that institution's growth and evolution. His path breaking research made keystone contributions to the present day field of endocrinology and he earned wide recognition and appreciation for his pioneering work in this nascent discipline. In acknowledgement, the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Diseases was named in his honor. He also established an annual prize in recognition of scientific excellence and character as well as a lecture series, which served to engage renown practitioners from throughout the world with the Endocrine Division. A man of impeccable character, warmth and understated grace, he was animated by perpetual curiosity and insightful intelligence and he served as an inspiring mentor to many. He was civic minded and contributed to his community in numerous ways, serving on the Board of Trustees of Central Synagogue and as a long time member of the Lotos Club. Intensely loyal and devoted to his family, he was the beloved husband of the late Hilda Weiss Gabrilove, cherished father of Janice L. Gabrilove and the late Sandra Gabrilove Saltzman, adored grandfather to Mark and Matthew Dirzulaitis and father-in-law and friend to Michael Dirzulaitis. Services will be held at Central Synagogue, 652 Lexington Avenue, on Wednesday at 10:00am. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Hilda & J.

2014-10-15T00:00:00Z,"COWLEY--Geoffrey, 59, died of colon cancer on October 14, 2014. Geoff was a gentle, humble man with a shining intellect and an open heart. Throughout his 30-year career as a journalist and public health advocate, he made science and medicine vividly accessible to general readers, while championing health as a human right. As Newsweek magazine's health editor--a post he held from 1988 through 2006--he exhibited a special talent for simplifying complexity without sacrificing nuance. Whether he was explaining how memory works or reporting on health conditions in the world's poorest countries, he transformed facts into stories as engaging as they were learned. Later, as an associate New York City health commissioner, he helped the Bloomberg administration confront challenges ranging from HIV to smoking and obesity. More recently, as a national writer for msnbc.com, he deftly chronicled the long struggle to implement the Affordable Care Act. To Susan Pelzer, his wife of 30 years, Geoff was the light of the universe gathered in a lifetime. And to Colin Cowley, his 25-year-old son, Geoff was a loving friend and mentor, who consistently emphasized the value of curiosity and compassion. Geoff is survived by many family members who live in the west: his father, James Philip Cowley, his sister, Linda Clark, and her three daughters, his brother, Collin Cowley, and his three children, and the Jorgensen family. Geoff's family requests that any gifts in his honor be made to Doctors Without Borders."

He drafted the first open housing act to be enacted south of the Mason-Dixon Line and argued four cases before the United States Supreme Court. His keen mind, gentle curiosity and humility all defined his life. He will be profoundly missed by family, friends, and generations of former students and colleagues.

2014-10-17T00:00:00Z,"GRAD--Frank P.,died at his home on October 14, 2014; he was 90. Born in Austria in 1924, Grad left his country on the Kindertransport with his sister to escape Nazism. After living with a family in England, he immigrated to the United States in 1939. The papers that recorded his arrival in New York list him as ""stateless,"" but Grad wasted no time in making New York City his home. Although as a child he witnessed the horrors of anti-Semitism under Hitler, he rarely spoke of that experience, wanting instead to look forward to the promise of a bright future in America. A true son of his adopted city, he attended Eastern District High School, Brooklyn College, and Columbia Law School, where he earned an LL.B. in 1949. After a brief career in private practice, Grad returned to Columbia Law School to work for, and eventually direct, the influential Legislative Drafting Research Fund. He joined the full-time Columbia Law Faculty in 1969, teaching and publishing extensively on legislation, public health law, and environmental law. A dynamic and thoughtful force on the Columbia campus, Grad played a vital role in the recovery from the student unrest of 1968, leading the research and drafting team that recommended reforms to open the university's governance to greater student and faculty participation. His faculty colleagues remember him for his voluminous contribution to the law and to legal scholarship, his meticulous research, and his passion for public service. Grad, who served as a close adviser to Mayor John Lindsay, is credited with helping to establish the Housing Court in New York. A champion of public services for working-class New Yorkers, Grad drafted the New York City Health Code, the New York City Air Pollution Control Code, the New York City Housing Maintenance Code, the Model State Constitution, and the Model State and Regional Planning Law, among others. Grad also wrote the first comprehensive treatise on environmental law. He will be remembered by his friends and family for his wit, compassion and intellect. Grad was preceded in death by his sister and by his son, David Anthony Grad, who died in 2007. Grad is survived by his wife Lisa, his daughter Catharine A. Grad, and Catharine's two sons, Samuel Grad Oliver and James Grad Oliver. Funeral services will be at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, NYC, NY 10023, on Sunday, October 19, 2014, at 11:15am."

2014-10-19T00:00:00Z,"TAMNY--Martin, passed away on October 18, 2014. He was born in the Bronx, attended George Washington High School, the City College of New York, Wolfson College at Oxford, and received his PhD from City University of New York in 1976. He was Professor of Philosophy and then a most cherished, principled and accomplished Dean of Social Sciences, then of Humanities and the Arts at CCNY while also teaching at the CUNY Graduate Center. His classes ranged over many areas of philosophy, but his central interests were in the philosophy and history of science. Among many other publications, he co-edited Isaac Newton's Trinity Notebook, an important early manuscript of Newton's. As Dean of Humanities, Martin navigated the division through one of the worst fiscal crises in CCNY's history, managing to strengthen it through far-seeing strategic initiatives, including the establishment of the K.D. Irani endowment in philosophy. Martin's distinguished accomplishments as a professor, writer, and administrator never took precedence over his evident humanity, which showed in his dealings with colleagues and friends, but was most apparent in his family. Deeply devoted to his wife Myrna, of more than fifty years who died in 2013, he was a warm, often funny and always present and supportive father to Mark and Tara. His death is a profound loss to them and to their spouses, Coleen and Matthew, and Martin's grandchildren, Ella, Ben and Toby."

Through his gift creating the Pels Family Center, he helped recruit several outstanding early-career faculty, providing them with enhanced opportunities to share ideas and collaborate. Don was deeply interested in the young investigators he supported, and he derived enormous pleasure from meeting with them to learn about their work. Don's passion for scientific inquiry led him to establish the Pels Family Professorship, an endowed chair for a senior faculty member. Don and his wife, Wendy Keys, also supported many other initiatives at Rockefeller, including the Tri-Institutional Noon Concert Series. Beyond Rockefeller, Don will be remembered for his service on the boards of a number of prestigious institutions, including the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and the Philharmonic Symphony Society of New York, and his active engagement in the cultural life of New York City. Don will be greatly missed by the Rockefeller campus community. We send our heartfelt condolences to Don's beloved wife, Wendy; his three children, Juliette, Valerie and Laurence; and his entire family.

He received the A.B. degree from Johns University in 1949, the M.D. from NYU in 1953, and two M.S. degrees from NYU, in 1956 and 1959.

Dr. Harber was a gifted and charismatic physician-scientist, educator and clinician and one of the leading academic dermatologists of his generation. He trained numerous residents and fellows who have achieved leadership positions around the world. Under his direction the Columbia department was recognized as a global center of excellence in the area of Photobiology, a discipline focused on studying the effects of sunlight on the skin. He and his collaborators made major contributions regarding human skin diseases associated with sun exposure including cutaneous porphyria and photoallergic reactions. During his tenure, Dr. Harber created one of the major centers in the world dedicated to using artificial light sources for treating human skin diseases such as psoriasis. He pioneered implementation of out-patient ambulatory day-treatment of patients with psoriasis. In addition to his academic accomplishments Len was an avid fisherman and a passionate oenophile and gourmet who traveled the world seeking out unique culinary experiences. He was a learned man of great intellectual depth and breadth and a wonderful raconteur. He has left an indelible legacy to the department and to Columbia University.

2014-10-20T00:00:00Z,"RONAN--Dr. William John, died just shy of his 102nd birthday at his home in West Palm Beach on October 15th. Born in Buffalo, New York on November 8th, 1912, Dr. Ronan's love of adventure and intellectual curiosity had him visiting the Great Wall of China by age 18. Dr. Ronan attended Syracuse University and subsequently received his doctorate at NYU, the start of a burgeoning career in academia and public service. Dr. Ronan became a professor and ultimately the Dean of NYU's School of Public Administration, the youngest person to achieve the post at the time. He was subsequently recruited to join the executive staff of Mayor Robert Wagner, and soon caught the attention of the man who would be a lifelong friend and colleague, Governor Nelson Rockefeller. With the Governor, Dr. Ronan made a lasting impression on the city of New York, creating the Metropolitan Transit Authority, of which he became the first Chairman and CEO in 1968. In 1974, he was appointed Chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where he oversaw construction of the World Trade Center and served until 1977. Continuing his lifelong dedication to public service, Dr. Ronan continued his career as commissioner and subsequently Chairman of the UTDC until 1994. Dr. Ronan was a tour de force in his public life, and his achievements are numerous. But those close to him will best remember his warmth, wit, and special sparkle; Bill was a man with a huge heart. His dear wife, Elena Vinade, whom he married in 1939, predeceases him. He is survived by two daughters- Monica Ronan and Diana Quasha, three grandchildren- Devon, Grant and Weston, three great-grandchildren, and his partner Bette Machon. To borrow words from his favorite poem, ""Invictus,"" He was the master of his fate, the captain of his soul."

Over the years, Don served on many Board committees, including Audit, Budget and Operations, Development, and Technology Transfer. His participation in the work of these committees and his commitment to advancing scientific research greatly strengthened the University. Early in his involvement at Rockefeller, Don took a leadership role by establishing the Pels Family Center for Biochemistry and Structural Biology. Through his gift creating the Pels Family Center, he helped recruit several outstanding early-career faculty, providing them with enhanced opportunities to share ideas and collaborate. Don was deeply interested in the young investigators he supported, and he derived enormous pleasure from meeting with them to learn about their work. Don's passion for scientific inquiry led him to establish the Pels Family Professorship, an endowed chair for a senior faculty member. Don and his wife, Wendy Keys, also supported many other initiatives at Rockefeller, including the Tri-Institutional Noon Concert Series. Beyond Rockefeller, Don will be remembered for his service on the boards of a number of prestigious institutions, including the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and the Philharmonic Symphony Society of New York, and his active engagement in the cultural life of New York City. Don will be greatly missed by the Rockefeller campus community.

2014-10-21T00:00:00Z,"TAMNY--Martin, passed away on October 18, 2014. He was born in the Bronx, attended George Washington High School, the City College of New York, Wolfson College at Oxford, and received his PhD from City University of New York in 1976. He was Professor of Philosophy and then a most cherished, principled and accomplished Dean of Social Sciences, then of Humanities and the Arts at CCNY while also teaching at the CUNY Graduate Center. His classes ranged over many areas of philosophy, but his central interests were in the philosophy and history of science. Among many other publications, he co-edited Isaac Newton's Trinity Notebook, an important early manuscript of Newton's. As Dean of Humanities, Martin navigated the division through one of the worst fiscal crises in CCNY's history, managing to strengthen it through far-seeing strategic initiatives, including the establishment of the K.D. Irani endowment in philosophy. Martin's distinguished accomplishments as a professor, writer, and administrator never took precedence over his evident humanity, which showed in his dealings with colleagues and friends, but was most apparent in his family. Deeply devoted to his wife Myrna, of more than fifty years who died in 2013, he was a warm, often funny and always present and supportive father to Mark and Tara. His death is a profound loss to them and to their spouses, Coleen and Matthew, and Martin's grandchildren, Ella, Ben and Toby."

2014-10-21T00:00:00Z,"RONAN--Dr. William John, died just shy of his 102nd birthday at his home in West Palm Beach on October 15th. Born in Buffalo, New York on November 8th, 1912, Dr. Ronan's love of adventure and intellectual curiosity had him visiting the Great Wall of China by age 18. Dr. Ronan attended Syracuse University and subsequently received his doctorate at NYU, the start of a burgeoning career in academia and public service. Dr. Ronan became a professor and ultimately the Dean of NYU's School of Public Administration, the youngest person to achieve the post at the time. He was subsequently recruited to join the executive staff of Mayor Robert Wagner, and soon caught the attention of the man who would be a lifelong friend and colleague, Governor Nelson Rockefeller. With the Governor, Dr. Ronan made a lasting impression on the city of New York, creating the Metropolitan Transit Authority, of which he became the first Chairman and CEO in 1968. In 1974, he was appointed Chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where he oversaw construction of the World Trade Center and served until 1977. Continuing his lifelong dedication to public service, Dr. Ronan continued his career as commissioner and subsequently Chairman of the UTDC until 1994. Dr. Ronan was a tour de force in his public life, and his achievements are numerous. But those close to him will best remember his warmth, wit, and special sparkle; Bill was a man with a huge heart. His dear wife, Elena Vinade, whom he married in 1939, predeceases him. He is survived by two daughters- Monica Ronan and Diana Quasha, three grandchildren- Devon, Grant and Weston, three great-grandchildren, and his partner Bette Machon.

Ned Regan's tenure as president of Baruch College was marked by significant increases in the SAT scores of incoming freshmen, dramatically improved graduation rates and recognition for having the most diverse student body in the nation each of those years. The most visible sign of change at Baruch was the opening of the Newman Vertical Campus in the fall of 2001. Also under Regan's leadership, Baruch launched the innovative and popular Executives on Campus program, putting successful alumni and other friends of the College into classrooms and mentoring relationships with current students. In response to growing financial reporting scandals, he drew on a lifelong commitment to fiscal responsibility and integrity to push for the establishment of the Center for Financial Reporting, now the Robert Zicklin Center for Corporate Integrity. Prior to his years at Baruch where he was a tireless and passionate advocate for the College and its mission, Regan was New York State comptroller from 1979 to 1993.

2014-10-21T00:00:00Z,"OLCAY--Onder John, beloved husband, father and grandfather, died peacefully at home on October 17 after a valiant battle against prostate cancer. He was 77 years old. Born in Izmir, Turkey, John graduated from Robert College, Istanbul, and received an M.A. and an M.B.A. from the Wharton School. From early on, international finance was central to his career. As a vice president of the Bank of New York, he helped establish the bank's first international office, in London. As a partner at London's W. Greenwell & Co., he became one of the first members of the London Stock Exchange not born in the U.K. or Commonwealth. In 1974 he launched a pioneering joint effort with New York's Fischer Francis Trees & Watts to advise central banks and multinational companies on their U.S. dollar portfolios. This initiative led to long associations with central banks and monetary authorities around the globe. In 1983 he joined Fischer Francis Trees & Watts and rose to be vice chairman and managing director. Since the late 1960s John has advised Netherlands-based Aegon N.V., serving on the boards of its North American subsidiaries and then on the Aegon N.V. supervisory board. In recent years he has been an adviser to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in Washington. He also was dedicated to the communities where he lived, advising nonprofit organizations in New York City; London; and Point O'Woods, New York. John loved soccer, classical music and opera, theater, fine food and the rugged beauty of the far north of Scotland. Throughout a career characterized by many enduring friendships, John especially enjoyed mentoring younger colleagues, always focusing them on the importance of ethics and integrity. The day before he died, he joined friends and colleagues at a symposium on ethics and the economy organized in his honor. There the Peterson Institute for International Economics announced an endowment for the O. John Olcay Annual Lecture on Ethics and Economic Policy. John is survived by his wife Phebe, daughters Margot and Charlotte, grandson Christopher Kaya, sister Nukhet and cousin Attila. His funeral will be held at Saint James' Episcopal Church, 865 Madison Ave., on Friday, October 24, at 3:30pm. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Peterson Institute for International Economics: O. John Olcay Annual Lecture on Ethics and Economic Policy."

2014-10-21T00:00:00Z,"MALINSKY--Randie W. A devoted daughter, sister, wife, mother, grandmother, friend, intellectual and philanthropist passed away on October 18, 2014 in her home. She was 64 and had waged a courageous fight against lung cancer. Randie was a true lover of life! She lived inside of each moment spontaneously and with great zest. Her intellectual curiosity had no bounds. Randie continually strived to learn more history, culture, religion and current events. She thoroughly immersed herself into her family life, as well as her professional career. Randie's quest for knowledge began at an early age. She received an MBA from Hofstra University and began a marketing career at American Home Products. Eventually, she joined the family business, Waldbaum's Supermarkets. At Waldbaum's, Randie was the buyer of ethnic and kosher foods that were delivered directly to stores, bypassing the warehouse. She was ahead of her time in utilizing direct store delivery, as well as promoting and introducing a vast array of varied ethnic products to the public. She developed marketing campaigns around the products, including food festivals, competitions and holiday calendars. Randie played a significant role in developing this unique niche market which is now emulated by some of the biggest supermarket chains in the world. In addition to her significant professional contributions, Randie devoted significant time and effort in pursuit of her many passions. She explored museums in the United States and abroad, the contemporary art scene, porcelain painting and jewelry design. She loved the theater, ballet and opera. Randie traveled around the world on great adventures alongside of her husband of 44 years, Aaron Malinsky. They shared a wonderful love story, having met on a blind date and been best friends every day since. Randie and Aaron were a true compliment to one another and shared great joy, as well as sorrow, holding hands through it all. Born to Bernice and Ira Waldbaum, Randie grew up with strong family values and a commitment to Jewish learning. Her greatest philanthropic devotion was to The Jewish Theological Seminary. Randie served as a member of the Board of the Rabbinical School at JTS since 1994 and as the Board's Chairperson since 2009. During her tenure she championed the development of the Pastoral Care program and created a connection with JTS and the Hebrew language program at Middlebury College. Most recently Randie and Aaron gifted a fellowship to the incoming classes of the Rabbinical School and the H.L. Miller Cantorial School and College of Jewish Music of JTS. The Malinsky Fellowship will provide a living stipend to first year rabbinical and cantorial students. Randie also served and supported several non-profit organizations including the Long Island Committee for Soviet Jewry, The Eglevsky Ballet, the Auschwitz Jewish Center, The Rhinelander Center of the Children's Aid Society, and the Jewish Lens. She served on the Art Collection Committee of the Jewish Museum and had provided a grant to Uniting Against Lung Cancer for continued research in the fight to cure lung cancer. Randie's most valuable treasure was her family. She is survived by her mother, Bernice Waldbaum, husband Aaron, children Carolyn, Benjamin, and David, daughter-in-law Rebecca, grandchildren Liam and Molly, siblings Martin Waldbaum, Arthur and Nadine Waldbaum, Nancy Waldbaum, Linda Malinsky, Debbie and David Orshevsky, five nieces, five nephews, many cousins and beloved friends. Her funeral service was held on Monday, October 20, 2014 at Park Avenue Synagogue."

The Rector, Wardens and Vestry of Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, on behalf of the Parish, announce the death of their beloved Eleventh Rector (1972-1996), Canon John Andrew. Canon Andrew was born in Yorkshire, England, was a priest in the Church of England, and served as Domestic Chaplain to Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey. In 1972, he was called to be Rector at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, where he had a distinguished tenure in which his preaching, pastoral presence, and leadership of the liturgy drew large congregations to the Church, an achievement especially notable during an era of decline in the Episcopal Church. Canon Andrew and Organist and Master of Choristers, Dr. Gerre Hancock, were instrumental in the preservation and enrichment of the Anglican choral tradition in the United States through the Saint Thomas Choir School. He was awarded honorary degrees from several Episcopal/Anglican seminaries in recognition of his work. John Andrew was a friend and confidant of many church leaders both within and outside the Episcopal Church and Anglicanism. He was a particular friend of Terence Cardinal Cooke and was a promoter of ecumenical relations between the Anglican and Roman Catholic communions. He was a cherished member of the Saint Thomas family for over 40 years. Funeral services will be at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue on Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 5:30pm.

2014-10-22T00:00:00Z,"RONAN--Dr. William John, died just shy of his 102nd birthday at his home in West Palm Beach on October 15th. Born in Buffalo, New York on November 8th, 1912, Dr. Ronan's love of adventure and intellectual curiosity had him visiting the Great Wall of China by age 18. Dr. Ronan attended Syracuse University and subsequently received his doctorate at NYU, the start of a burgeoning career in academia and public service. Dr. Ronan became a professor and ultimately the Dean of NYU's School of Public Administration, the youngest person to achieve the post at the time. He was subsequently recruited to join the executive staff of Mayor Robert Wagner, and soon caught the attention of the man who would be a lifelong friend and colleague, Governor Nelson Rockefeller. With the Governor, Dr. Ronan made a lasting impression on the city of New York, creating the Metropolitan Transit Authority, of which he became the first Chairman and CEO in 1968. In 1974, he was appointed Chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where he oversaw construction of the World Trade Center and served until 1977. Continuing his lifelong dedication to public service, Dr. Ronan continued his career as commissioner and subsequently Chairman of the UTDC until 1994. Dr. Ronan was a tour de force in his public life, and his achievements are numerous. But those close to him will best remember his warmth, wit, and special sparkle; Bill was a man with a huge heart. His dear wife, Elena Vinade, whom he married in 1939, predeceases him. He is survived by two daughters- Monica Ronan and Diana Quasha, three grandchildren- Devon, Grant and Weston, three great-grandchildren, and his partner Bette Machon. To borrow words from his favorite poem, ""Invictus,"" He was the master of his fate, the captain of his soul."

2014-10-22T00:00:00Z,"OLCAY--Onder John, beloved husband, father and grandfather, died peacefully at home on October 17 after a valiant battle against prostate cancer. He was 77 years old. Born in Izmir, Turkey, John graduated from Robert College, Istanbul, and received an M.A. and an M.B.A. from the Wharton School. From early on, international finance was central to his career. As a vice president of the Bank of New York, he helped establish the bank's first international office, in London. As a partner at London's W. Greenwell & Co., he became one of the first members of the London Stock Exchange not born in the U.K. or Commonwealth. In 1974 he launched a pioneering joint effort with New York's Fischer Francis Trees & Watts to advise central banks and multinational companies on their U.S. dollar portfolios. This initiative led to long associations with central banks and monetary authorities around the globe. In 1983 he joined Fischer Francis Trees & Watts and rose to be vice chairman and managing director. Since the late 1960s John has advised Netherlands-based Aegon N.V., serving on the boards of its North American subsidiaries and then on the Aegon N.V. supervisory board. In recent years he has been an adviser to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in Washington. He also was dedicated to the communities where he lived, advising nonprofit organizations in New York City; London; and Point O'Woods, New York. John loved soccer, classical music and opera, theater, fine food and the rugged beauty of the far north of Scotland. Throughout a career characterized by many enduring friendships, John especially enjoyed mentoring younger colleagues, always focusing them on the importance of ethics and integrity. The day before he died, he joined friends and colleagues at a symposium on ethics and the economy organized in his honor. There the Peterson Institute for International Economics announced an endowment for the O. John Olcay Annual Lecture on Ethics and Economic Policy. John is survived by his wife Phebe, daughters Margot and Charlotte, grandson Christopher Kaya, sister Nukhet and cousin Attila. His funeral will be held at Saint James' Episcopal Church, 865 Madison Ave., on Friday, October 24, at 3:30pm.

2014-10-22T00:00:00Z,"CARTER--Andrew M. Andrew M. Carter, an early leader in the field of active bond management and one of the best bondsmen of his time, died at his home in Boston on October 17, 2014. He was 74 years old. With his upbeat approach to life, gracious manner, dapper attire, curled moustache, and keen mind, Andy Carter had a style all his own. Mr. Carter spent his entire professional career in the financial sector and developed a much sought after expertise in bonds and fixed income. After a short stint on Wall Street, he noticed that while there were thousands of stock experts, there was a dearth of bondsmen, and he jumped at the opportunity this presented. Within a very short time, at age just 24, he was running Harvard University's $500 million bond portfolio. In 1972, he described his philosophy as ""making sensible switches"" and noted further, ""It's sweaty work, yes, but there's nothing mystical about it."" In 1968 Mr. Carter helped form the bond group for Wellington Management Company, which he grew to more than $500 million in assets; he then founded Standard & Poor's/Carter, Doyle in 1972. In 1975 he joined Jennison Associates, where he led the bond department, became senior vice president, and stayed until 1992 as he grew the fund to $10 billion in assets. He next served as president of the fixed income investment management firm Andrew M. Carter & Company LP and in 1998 became chairman and CEO of Hyperion Capital Management, where he continued as senior advisor until 2010. A former colleague of Mr. Carter considered him to be ""one of the finest math guys"" in the business, further stating, ""Andy understands the math of bonds, the quirks of bonds."" Mr. Carter so loved what he did that he refused to call it work. He was born on June 7, 1940, in Englewood, New Jersey. His mother, Pauline Humeston Carter, was president of her class at Abbott Academy and president of Dana Hall at Wellesley College. His father, Herbert Pratt Carter, graduated first in his class at The Loomis School in 1920 and went on to Princeton University and Harvard Law School. In 1986 Mr. Carter named the first constructed girls dormitory at The Loomis Chaffee School, in Windsor, Connecticut, in honor of his parents. Mr. Carter followed in his father's footsteps at Loomis, also graduating first in his class, and went on to Harvard College, where he graduated in three years with an A.B. in English Literature. He is survived by his wife, Renee Krimsier Carter, an accomplished flutist and faculty member at the New England Conservatory and Boston University, who also performs as principal flute of the Boston Pops Esplanade Orchestra; by his sister, Susan Pratt Carter of Englewood, New Jersey; and by James P. Carter, his son from his first marriage to Dale Marsha Peterson. Philanthropy and service marked Mr. Carter's life. He believed that ""guiding children is the single best way to improve our collective future."" He was a trustee at Loomis from 1986 to the present, where he served as vice chairman of the board and longtime chair of the Investment Committee. Few people loved the school more, and Mr. Carter gave generously of his time and money. In addition to gifts for the dormitory and for Sellers Hall, the school's office of admission, he also made a gift to name the development office in honor of his wife Renee Krimsier Carter and endowed an instructorship in music in memory of his brother, Thomas Benedict Carter, combining his love for the school with his love of music. He also served on boards for the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Rochester; The New England Conservatory, where he was also chair of the Investment Committee for many years; Manchester Capital Management; and the Dean's Advisory Committee of the Boston University School of Management; and as president of the Big Brother Association of Boston. A member of the Bonita Bay Club, Mr. Carter and his wife divided their time among homes in Boston; Bonita Bay, Florida; and Strafford, Vermont. Andy Carter had a roving intellect, and his interests included poetry, history, horses, golf, and music. He was particularly fond of A. E. Housman's poems. When Housman died, his family found a previously unpublished poem marked ""For My Funeral."" Mr. Carter read that poem at the funerals for his mother, father, and brother. The last stanza of that poem follows: ""We now to peace and darkness, And earth and thee restore, Thy creature that thou madest And wilt cast forth no more."" On Sunday, October 26, the family will hold calling hours from 2p.m. until 5p.m. at 10 Walnut Street in Boston, Massachusetts. On Saturday, November 8, a memorial service will take place at 11a.m. in the chapel of Founders Hall at The Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Connecticut, with a 10a.m. reception and a 12:30p.m. luncheon. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to The Loomis Chaffee School, 4 Batchelder Road, Windsor, CT 06095."

2014-10-22T00:00:00Z,"BAUMSLAG--Gilbert. Distinguished Professor Emeritus, CCNY, died October 20, after a brief illness. Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, he earned his B.Sc. Honours (Masters) and D.Sc. from the University of Witwatersrand, and his Ph.D. from the University of Manchester. He has given keynote addresses in most conferences in infinite group theory on five continents. He worked with many mathematicians and had more than 30 doctoral students. He played tennis, golf and squash in adulthood but always regretted that he had not followed his first ambition, persuaded not to by his father who thought it frivolous: to play cricket for South Africa a game he followed throughout his lifetime. He first came to the U.S. to teach at Princeton and then moved on to NYU, CUNY, and Rice University before rejoining CUNY at City College in 1973 as Distinguished Professor, a classification limited to 175 and is described by CUNY as an exceptional scholar with an international reputation for scholarly and/or research excellence. He had several academic relationships including ETH in Zurich and the University of Warwick in the U.K. He was the author of more than 150 mathematical papers along with books and monographs. His research was supported for decades and for millions by the National Science Foundation. He was also the Founder and Director of the Center for Algorithms & Interactive Scientific Software (CAISS). He had a great fondness for Nantucket where he spent more than 25 years during school vacations and holidays writing papers, exploring problems on his famous 500lb blackboard installed on the office wall of his his beloved old house on Darling Street. He was enormously fond of many friends on Nantucket with whom he shared a lot of important and silly experiences. One such was playing cricket on Darling Street on a hot August night with four amateurs at the game.There were no winners. There were also no losers. He also loved having lunch at The Opera House where there was no rush, no impatience, and just great food, a great atmosphere, all under the guidance of the renowned Gwen Gaillard. And the always present lure of the Atlantic Ocean was not to be ignored. He loved the land of his birth and was truly happy when the government was transformed by the release of Nelson Mandela. He went to Johannesburg whenever possible for more than 40 years not only to see old friends but also to encourage math projects in the country. He is survived by his wife, Mary Kennedy Baumslag, Len Cohen of South Africa, his childhood partner in many misadventures; his well respected friend, Howard Siegel,M.D. and a lot of beloved friends and colleagues, in New York, on Nantucket and around the world; devoted and accomplished former students, several nieces and nephews, and a few remote blood relatives. No service is planned at this time."

The Rector, Wardens and Vestry of Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, on behalf of the Parish, announce the death of their beloved Eleventh Rector (1972-1996), Canon John Andrew. Canon Andrew was born in Yorkshire, England, was a priest in the Church of England, and served as Domestic Chaplain to Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey. In 1972, he was called to be Rector at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, where he had a distinguished tenure in which his preaching, pastoral presence, and leadership of the liturgy drew large congregations to the Church, an achievement especially notable during an era of decline in the Episcopal Church. Canon Andrew and Organist and Master of Choristers, Dr. Gerre Hancock, were instrumental in the preservation and enrichment of the Anglican choral tradition in the United States through the Saint Thomas Choir School. He was awarded honorary degrees from several Episcopal/Anglican seminaries in recognition of his work. John Andrew was a friend and confidant of many church leaders both within and outside the Episcopal Church and Anglicanism. He was a particular friend of Terence Cardinal Cooke and was a promoter of ecumenical relations between the Anglican and Roman Catholic communions. He was a cherished member of the Saint Thomas family for over 40 years. Funeral services will be at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue on Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 5:30pm. Donations in lieu of flowers, may be made to the Canon John Andrew Memorial Fund. Please make checks payable to Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue at 1 West 53rd St.; New York, NY 10019-5496.

2014-10-23T00:00:00Z,"WERTHEIMER--Alfred, a New York photographer whose photographs of a 21-year-old Elvis Presley in 1956 are widely considered to be the definitive visual document of the soon-to-be ""King of Rock and Roll,"" died on October 19th in his home in New York City. He was 85 years old. Mr. Wertheimer, who fled Hitler's Germany with his father Julius, his mother Katy, and his brother Henry in 1936, came to New York City and settled in an apartment on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn. After graduating from high school in 1947 he was accepted at Cooper Union School of Art in Manhattan where he first photographed events with a camera his brother Henry had given him. In 1951 Wertheimer graduated college with a major in advertising design and the following year he was drafted into the Army. When he returned home to New York City in 1954, Wertheimer landed a job with fashion photographer Tom Palumbo who worked for Harper's Bazaar magazine and eventually began his own freelance photography business. In 1955 fate intervened when he was introduced to Ann Fulchino, a publicist at RCA, who asked Wertheimer to take photos of RCA's latest acquisition, a young singer named Elvis Presley. His last book, ""Elvis and the Birth of Rock and Roll,"" was published in 2013. His publisher, Benedikt Taschen, said that, ""Alfred Wertheimer took an assignment nobody else was interested in, to shoot an up-and-coming crooner from Memphis. He had the instinct to know that a revolution was coming and he followed Elvis on the road and elsewhere for another two weeks after his job for RCA was done. What came out of this is extraordinary in its intimacy and unparalleled in its scope. Al immortalized a young man in the very process of making history."" Following his work with Elvis, Wertheimer continued for a number of years as a freelance photographer, eventually transitioning to documentary cinematographer, working as one of the principle cameramen of the film ""Woodstock,"" as well as covering the 1960 Presidential campaigns of John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. Wertheimer is survived by his nieces Pamela Wertheimer and Heidi Wohlfeld. Memorial Service will be held Friday, October 24th at 1pm at the Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Ave., New York."

The AHRC New York City Board of Directors, staff, membership, people supported and their families mourn the passing of AHRC New York City's former Executive Director, Michael Goldfarb, and extend sympathy to his beloved and bereaved family. Michael served as the Executive Director of AHRC for 36 years. His tireless efforts to improve the lives of people we serve transformed the organization and indeed the entire field of serving those with developmental disabilities. When he assumed leadership of AHRC 1975, the organization had 200 employees; nearly 40 years later, AHRC employs over 4,000. This remarkable growth is due in large part to the vision and dedication of a man who helmed the agency for over four decades--Michael Goldfarb. AHRC's growth and accomplishments over the past forty years could not have happened without him. Michael was a force to reckon with. His intelligence and vision were unsurpassed as were his deep caring and compassion for the people supported by AHRC and their families. His political savvy and ability to create change was always impressive, as was his ability to relate to the people supported by AHRC. People supported felt comfortable going over to him to ask questions and make requests and he never failed to respond to them with respect and with humor. Michael will be remembered for years to come. He has left an amazing legacy at AHRC New York City and was a driving force in New York State, greatly admired by his colleagues. Michael is survived by his wife, Priscilla who resides in Garrison New York, his sons Will, Abe and Ben, their wives and his grandchildren. Our sincerest condolences to all of them. Laura Kennedy, President AHRC New York City, President, NYSARC Inc. Gary Lind, Executive Director, AHRC New York City"

The Rector, Wardens and Vestry of Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, on behalf of the Parish, announce the death of their beloved Eleventh Rector (1972-1996), Canon John Andrew. Canon Andrew was born in Yorkshire, England, was a priest in the Church of England, and served as Domestic Chaplain to Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey. In 1972, he was called to be Rector at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, where he had a distinguished tenure in which his preaching, pastoral presence, and leadership of the liturgy drew large congregations to the Church, an achievement especially notable during an era of decline in the Episcopal Church. Canon Andrew and Organist and Master of Choristers, Dr. Gerre Hancock, were instrumental in the preservation and enrichment of the Anglican choral tradition in the United States through the Saint Thomas Choir School. He was awarded honorary degrees from several Episcopal/Anglican seminaries in recognition of his work. John Andrew was a friend and confidant of many church leaders both within and outside the Episcopal Church and Anglicanism. He was a particular friend of Terence Cardinal Cooke and was a promoter of ecumenical relations between the Anglican and Roman Catholic communions. He was a cherished member of the Saint Thomas family for over 40 years. Funeral services will be at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue on Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 5:30pm. Donations in lieu of flowers, may be made to the Canon John Andrew Memorial Fund. Please make checks payable to Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue at 1 West 53rd St.; New York, NY 10019-5496.

As a vice president of the Bank of New York, he helped establish the bank's first international office, in London. As a partner at London's W. Greenwell & Co., he became one of the first members of the London Stock Exchange not born in the U.K. or Commonwealth. In 1974 he launched a pioneering joint effort with New York's Fischer Francis Trees & Watts to advise central banks and multinational companies on their U.S. dollar portfolios. This initiative led to long associations with central banks and monetary authorities around the globe. In 1983 he joined Fischer Francis Trees & Watts and rose to be vice chairman and managing director. Since the late 1960s John has advised Netherlands-based Aegon N.V., serving on the boards of its North American subsidiaries and then on the Aegon N.V. supervisory board. In recent years he has been an adviser to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in Washington. He also was dedicated to the communities where he lived, advising nonprofit organizations in New York City; London; and Point O'Woods, New York. John loved soccer, classical music and opera, theater, fine food and the rugged beauty of the far north of Scotland. Throughout a career characterized by many enduring friendships, John especially enjoyed mentoring younger colleagues, always focusing them on the importance of ethics and integrity. The day before he died, he joined friends and colleagues at a symposium on ethics and the economy organized in his honor. There the Peterson Institute for International Economics announced an endowment for the O. John Olcay Annual Lecture on Ethics and Economic Policy. John is survived by his wife Phebe, daughters Margot and Charlotte, grandson Christopher Kaya, sister Nukhet and cousin Attila. His funeral will be held at Saint James' Episcopal Church, 865 Madison Ave., on Friday, October 24, at 3:30pm. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Peterson Institute for International Economics: O. John Olcay Annual Lecture on Ethics and Economic Policy."
2014-10-24T00:00:00Z,"O'BRIEN--Monsignor William B.,died October 19 at St. Pius X Church in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 90. Monsignor was a seminal figure in residential drug treatment and earned worldwide recognition and appreciation for his pioneering work in this field. That day over 50 years ago when he founded Daytop changed the way we view and treat addiction. He was also co-founder of the World Federation of Therapeutic Communities which he guided into a global movement establishing treatment programs in countries throughout the world. A trusted adviser to heads of state, as well as to His Holiness Pope John Paul II, Monsignor O'Brien helped shape policies that have radically improved treatment programs around the world. He was the author of the highly acclaimed book, ""You Can't Do It Alone: The Daytop Way To Make Your Child Drug Free"", published numerous papers in national and international journals, and inspired generations of treatment professionals. All the while he remained at heart a simple parish priest as deeply devoted to his parishioners at St. Brendan's in the Bronx as he was to the residents in treatment and their families. A truly extraordinary man of staggering faith, integrity, warmth, and loyalty whose impact on drug treatment has been profound and lasting. Monsignor O' Brien's enduring legacy will be his selfless dedication to saving young lives and his unswerving devotion to his church and God. A mass of Christian burial will be held at St. Pius X Church, 91 Secor Road, Scarsdale, NY, on Saturday, October 25 at 10:30am. In lieu of flowers donations in his memory may be made to St. Pius X Church."

After Johns Hopkins, she produced the iconic PBS show ""Wall Street Week"" with Louis Rukeyser; Rukeyser, recognizing her very rare combination of talents a flair for words coupled with an amazing facility with numbers - became a mentor.

2014-10-25T00:00:00Z,"EHRENPREIS--Ralph. June 9, 1942 - October 18, 2014 Ralph Ehrenpreis wrote a first draft of his obituary over the years, but often quipped that he wanted it to be published many years in the future, if at all. Ralph was born in Memphis, Tennessee to Irv and Bess Ehrenpreis and shortly thereafter moved to Oak Park, MI, a suburb of Detroit, where he grew up with his only sister, Tobi. When he was ten, his father passed away and there began his everlasting quest to avoid his own death. He went to University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where he graduated in 1963. Thereafter, he moved to California to marry Sandra Jackson and to attend Stanford Law School, where he received his Juris Doctor in 1967. After moving to Los Angeles to work for a large law firm, he quickly found his niche by establishing an immigration law practice more than 40 years ago, which continues to be one of the most successful such firms in the country. His passion for his work was only surpassed by his love of jazz, theater, film, exercise, literature, and his family. Over the years he amassed a remarkable and vast collection of jazz recordings. He played his music loud, scrutinizing every word of the liner notes, had an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of the music and artists, and was a scholar of all things jazz. He was a voracious reader with his home filled with shelves of books from decades of interests. Although he will be remembered for his tireless commitment to his law practice, most will remember a man with an unsurpassed sense of humor, wry and quick wit, and sarcasm. As much as he loved making others laugh, he loved making himself laugh even more. Beneath his irreverence was a man who loved his friends, made strangers smile, and made time every day of his life to be there for his closest family. So many people loved and admired his insatiable curiosity, depth of interests, sheer intellect, and charisma and warmth. He was deeply committed to his wife of eighteen years, Jennifer Kaufman, his three children, Ira, Jeff, and Jason, his daughters-in-law, Ellen and Brooke, his step-children Darian and Ben, and his three grandchildren, Lindsay, Ashley, and Zachary. In the ultimate irony, his death was tragic like that of his father and so many of the jazz figures who were his heroes. Services were held at Hillside Memorial Park in Los Angeles on Wednesday, October 22, 2014 at 10am. To view the service, go to: http://RalphEhrenpeis53696.

Cash also accepted. Please send notes of remembrances, stories, and memories about Ralph to ralph@ehrenpreis.com"

2014-10-25T00:00:00Z,"COAKLEY--James Francis, emeritus professor of theatre in the Northwestern University School of Communication, died on June 18, 2014 of complications from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He was 80. He earned his bachelor of fine arts degree at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), and then served as a cryptographer in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. He earned an M.A. from the University of Minnesota (1959) and a Ph.D. from Northwestern University (1964). He lived a life of the mind, as teacher, director, and critic. He was respected and adored by his family, friends, and students. His teaching career spanned four decades, beginning at Loyola University and the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, followed by a stint at the University Michigan before returning to Northwestern University in 1976, where he remained until his retirement in 2005. He taught theatre history, interpretation, stage directing, acting, theory, and the development of dramatic art. He was highly regarded as an outstanding director of both classical and contemporary works for university theatre and other theatre companies. His many productions included ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" ""Love's Labour's Lost,"" Brecht's ""Edward II,"" ""Amadeus,"" Robert Patrick's ""Kennedy's Children,"" and a distinguished production of ""After the Fall,"" with the playwright, Arthur Miller, in attendance throughout the production process. He was chosen by the dean of what was then called the School of Speech, to direct the opening production of the new Theatre and Interpretation Center. He did so with a production of ""Hippolytus"" in the Ethel Barber Theatre. Composer Alan Stout, head of the Composition Department in the School of Music, provided an original score. In addition to publishing many academic essays and reviews in respected journals such as Comparative Drama, he worked as a theatre and music critic for the daily newspaper Chicago American. He was also known for his tremendously incisive wit and his hearty, sometimes outrageous, laugh. Many of his students have gone on to achieve great success in the entertainment industry and in academia, some receiving Tony and Emmy nominations and awards. He was deeply proud of his students' achievements in or outside of the arts. After retiring from Northwestern he relocated to Pennsylvania, where he lived with his sister, Irma Deiderick, who survives him along with his nephew, Brian Deiderick."

2014-10-26T00:00:00Z,"SOLLINS-BROWN--Susan. The Board of Directors of the Earle Brown Music Foundation is deeply saddened by the unexpected and sudden passing of Susan Sollins-Brown on October 13, 2014. Life and work were inseparable to her, as she understood work to be a creative activity -- not to be stopped other than to spend time with her dear family, or with her closest friends. Gentle and soft- spoken, she was a leader with natural authority. Grace permeated all of her actions. Although she served and fostered the art of others, both through ICI (now Independent Curators International), ART21, and as President and Trustee of the Earle Brown Music Foundation, she herself was also an exceptional artist and respected filmmaker. She chose her friends and her endeavors carefully and wisely, knowing that she would devote herself to them fully, often, for life. It was her genuine creativity and gentle power, her devotion, her long-term vision, and what appeared to be unstoppable energy that allowed her to build a legacy whose success and influence on others has spread throughout the world. This seemed to surprise her. Susan created the Earle Brown Music Foundation together with her beloved husband, the late composer Earle Appleton Brown, during a time when he was already terminally ill. After Earle's death in 2002, it was her mission and ongoing gift to him to ensure that his work would be well published in its entirety, as it is today, and that his archive would be available for study by future generations of researchers and musicologists. The Board of Directors and staff of the Earle Brown Music Foundation, continuing her mission, will miss her sorely."

2014-10-26T00:00:00Z,"QUIGLEY--Joan Ceciel. Joan was fortunate to be the dearly loved daughter of John Baird and Zelda Marks Quigley. Joan was the valedictorian of her class at the Sarah Dix Hamlin School and graduated with honors from Vassar College. After college, Joan returned to San Francisco to lead a life filled with volunteer work, the Junior League, docent work at the De Young Museum etc. Joan also led a very active social life filled with parties and courtship. Joan became the toast of the town, one of the most beautiful women in a city known for its beautiful women. During this period of her life, Joan also learned astrology and began to practice the discipline that would take her to the highest point of her profession. After writing a series of articles for Seventeen magazine, Joan used the nom de plume Angel Star for ""Astrology For Teens"" published in 1968. Joan also appeared many times on the Merv Griffin Show during the '60s and '70s. When Nancy Reagan, then First Lady of California, asked Merv for the best astrologer he knew, Merv recommended Joan. Joan worked as a volunteer on both of Ronald Reagan's presidential campaigns even though she knew that Reagan would not win the nomination in 1976. During the 1980 campaign before becoming the Republican nominee, Reagan misspoke on Taiwan. The campaign manager checked Joan's daily guide to find that she had warned in red that Reagan might misspeak on foreign policy that day. After that incident, Joan's advice was followed religiously. When Reagan won the presidency, Joan went on to other projects. After the assassination attempt, Nancy Reagan called Joan to ask if she could have predicted it. Joan said that she could have had she been following his chart. Nancy then asked Joan to take on the responsibility for keeping Reagan safe. Since 1860, all presidents elected in zero years have died in office or been assassinated. Joan asked for 24 hours to think it over and then agreed. While working with the Reagans, Joan modified Nancy's image, convinced Reagan to stop referring to the USSR as an ""Evil Empire"" and said that the President would be able to work with Gorbachev to achieve his goal of ending the Cold War. Joan timed Reagan's first meeting with Gorbachev in Geneva, the meeting at Reykjavik and all subsequent meetings. Joan helped defuse the Bitburg controversy and kept Reagan under wraps during Irangate. Joan was the teflon in the ""Teflon"" presidency. Joan wrote a book about her Reagan years called, ""What Does Joan Say?"" (1990) Joan also wrote two other books, ""Astrology For Adults"" (1969) and ""Astrology For The Parents Of Teenagers And Children"" (1971) and published a monograph, ""An Essay In Honor of Mohandas K. Gandhi"" in 1999. Joan had a very lively, creative and original mind. A published author and brilliant astrologer, Joan was also a gifted jewelry designer and artist. Joan had a mesmerizing kind of charm, a dry wit and did not suffer fools gladly. Joan loved art, opera, ballet and symphony. Joan also loved to travel and enjoyed fine food and wine. Joan is predeceased by her loving parents, John B. and Zelda M. Quigley and dear friends Dr. Albert Shumate, Marge Townsend and Ann Witter. She is survived by her devoted and grieving sister Ruth and friends VV de Margitay, Virginia Warner, Flo Eyre, Lovice de Reviczky, Katerina Cambron and Romy Babajian. Joan was cared for in her final illness by her loving caregiver Tima Nawai and visiting nurse Lourdes Torres. A memorial is planned at a later date. Donations may be made to the San Francisco Opera, San Francisco Ballet, Fine Arts Museums or the charity of your choice."

2014-10-26T00:00:00Z,"MOHAN--Thomas Reed, of Manhattan and Lanesville, NY, on October 11, 2014, age 64, at Mount Sinai Palliative Care. Born on August 16, 1950, the youngest son of Adell and Joseph Mohan, Tom grew up in Middletown, OH. Tom graduated from Middletown High School in 1968. Following a freshman year at Dartmouth, Tom in the autumn of 1969, just a few months after the Stonewall riots, transferred to NYU, where he embraced activism as a ground-floor member of the Gay Liberation Front. After earning his B.A., Tom attended Yale School of Drama with Meryl Streep, Sigourney Weaver, Wendy Wasserstein, Christopher Durang and Albert Innaurato, and obtained an M.F.A. in playwriting in 1975. Tom's many plays, influenced by Ronald Firbank, Ivy Compton-Burnett and Joe Orton, were never produced, perhaps because they were too eccentric. While continuing to write, Tom maintained his strong relationship with NYU by working at the university's American Language Institute, starting full-time in 1977, and eventually becoming its assistant director, a position he held until his death. About 20 years ago, Tom shifted his passion from writing, cooking and opulent party-giving to the quarter-acre garden he established at his retreat in the Catskill hamlet of Lanesville, where despite the limitation of Hardiness Zone 5a, he nurtured an astonishing and ever-expanding multitude of plants, including more than 150 varieties of astilbes, his favorite flower (especially pink ones). Tom was diagnosed with lymphoma in 1999 and combated it valiantly and without complaint to the end. In addition to his brother, Patrick, and sister-in-law, Lee, of Bluffton, SC, and five nephews, Tom is survived by a tight circle of friends and colleagues who will love and miss him until they too are gone. A memorial at NYU is planned for November 14."

2014-10-26T00:00:00Z,"MALINSKY--Randie W. A devoted daughter, sister, wife, mother, grandmother, friend, intellectual and philanthropist passed away on October 18, 2014 in her home. She was 64 and had waged a courageous fight against lung cancer. Randie was a true lover of life! She lived inside of each moment spontaneously and with great zest. Her intellectual curiosity had no bounds. Randie continually strived to learn more history, culture, religion and current events. She thoroughly immersed herself into her family life, as well as her professional career. Randie's quest for knowledge began at an early age. She received an MBA from Hofstra University and began a marketing career at American Home Products. Eventually, she joined the family business, Waldbaum's Supermarkets. At Waldbaum's, Randie was the buyer of ethnic and kosher foods that were delivered directly to stores, bypassing the warehouse. She was ahead of her time in utilizing direct store delivery, as well as promoting and introducing a vast array of varied ethnic products to the public. She developed marketing campaigns around the products, including food festivals, competitions and holiday calendars. Randie played a significant role in developing this unique niche market which is now emulated by some of the biggest supermarket chains in the world. In addition to her significant professional contributions, Randie devoted significant time and effort in pursuit of her many passions. She explored museums in the United States and abroad, the contemporary art scene, porcelain painting and jewelry design. She loved the theater, ballet and opera. Randie traveled around the world on great adventures alongside of her husband of 44 years, Aaron Malinsky. They shared a wonderful love story, having met on a blind date and been best friends every day since. Randie and Aaron were a true compliment to one another and shared great joy, as well as sorrow, holding hands through it all. Born to Bernice and Ira Waldbaum, Randie grew up with strong family values and a commitment to Jewish learning. Her greatest philanthropic devotion was to The Jewish Theological Seminary. Randie served as a member of the Board of the Rabbinical School at JTS since 1994 and as the Board's Chairperson since 2009. During her tenure she championed the development of the Pastoral Care program and created a connection with JTS and the Hebrew language program at Middlebury College. Most recently Randie and Aaron gifted a fellowship to the incoming classes of the Rabbinical School and the H.L. Miller Cantorial School and College of Jewish Music of JTS. The Malinsky Fellowship will provide a living stipend to first year rabbinical and cantorial students. Randie also served and supported several non-profit organizations including the Long Island Committee for Soviet Jewry, The Eglevsky Ballet, the Auschwitz Jewish Center, The Rhinelander Center of the Children's Aid Society, and the Jewish Lens. She served on the Art Collection Committee of the Jewish Museum and had provided a grant to Uniting Against Lung Cancer for continued research in the fight to cure lung cancer. Randie's most valuable treasure was her family. She is survived by her mother, Bernice Waldbaum, husband Aaron, children Carolyn, Benjamin, and David, daughter-in-law Rebecca, grandchildren Liam and Molly, siblings Martin Waldbaum, Arthur and Nadine Waldbaum, Nancy Waldbaum, Linda Malinsky, Debbie and David Orshevsky, five nieces, five nephews, many cousins and beloved friends.

He attended Los Angeles City College for two years before transferring to Stanford University where he worked his way through school while competing in athletics.

2014-10-26T00:00:00Z,"EHRENPREIS--Ralph. June 9, 1942 - October 18, 2014 Ralph Ehrenpreis wrote a first draft of his obituary over the years, but often quipped that he wanted it to be published many years in the future, if at all. Ralph was born in Memphis, Tennessee to Irv and Bess Ehrenpreis and shortly thereafter moved to Oak Park, MI, a suburb of Detroit, where he grew up with his only sister, Tobi. When he was ten, his father passed away and there began his everlasting quest to avoid his own death. He went to University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where he graduated in 1963. Thereafter, he moved to California to marry Sandra Jackson and to attend Stanford Law School, where he received his Juris Doctor in 1967. After moving to Los Angeles to work for a large law firm, he quickly found his niche by establishing an immigration law practice more than 40 years ago, which continues to be one of the most successful such firms in the country. His passion for his work was only surpassed by his love of jazz, theater, film, exercise, literature, and his family. Over the years he amassed a remarkable and vast collection of jazz recordings. He played his music loud, scrutinizing every word of the liner notes, had an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of the music and artists, and was a scholar of all things jazz. He was a voracious reader with his home filled with shelves of books from decades of interests. Although he will be remembered for his tireless commitment to his law practice, most will remember a man with an unsurpassed sense of humor, wry and quick wit, and sarcasm. As much as he loved making others laugh, he loved making himself laugh even more. Beneath his irreverence was a man who loved his friends, made strangers smile, and made time every day of his life to be there for his closest family. So many people loved and admired his insatiable curiosity, depth of interests, sheer intellect, and charisma and warmth. He was deeply committed to his wife of eighteen years, Jennifer Kaufman, his three children, Ira, Jeff, and Jason, his daughters-in-law, Ellen and Brooke, his step-children Darian and Ben, and his three grandchildren, Lindsay, Ashley, and Zachary. In the ultimate irony, his death was tragic like that of his father and so many of the jazz figures who were his heroes. Services were held at Hillside Memorial Park in Los Angeles on Wednesday, October 22, 2014 at 10am. To view the service, go to: http://RalphEhrenpeis53696.

2014-10-26T00:00:00Z,"BRADY--Robert Charles, a longtime Franklin Lakes, NJ, resident who was the patriarch of a large, far-flung family full of know-it-alls, died at home on October 4th with his wife of 64 years and three of his four daughters by his side. He was 91, and the biggest know-it-all of all. His wife, the former Katherine Stocker, met Bob Brady through her brother, the late Joseph P. Stocker, who studied chemical engineering at the University of Detroit with Mr. Brady. She was 19, and said she ""was envy of all the girls"" when she started dating the handsome Omaha native 67 years ago. Mr. Brady was the eldest of four boys born to Charles F. Brady and the former Gertrude Cobry. His three brothers, John R. of Omaha, William G. of Phoenix, and Michael G. of Nelson, New Zealand, survive him, as do six children: Ann E. Brady of Hawthorne, NJ; Patrick R. Brady of Dover, NH; Susan M. Brady of Boston; Carol L. Lundgren of Malmo, Sweden; Thomas M. Brady of New York City; and Katherine A. Spencer of Wynnewood, PA; and thirteen grandchildren. Mr. Brady graduated from Creighton Preparatory School in Omaha in 1941, where he was a top student and played guard and end on a co-state championship football team in 1940. He also found time to edit the school newspaper, co-edit the yearbook and play on an intramural basketball championship team. He earned the award of Eagle Scout, a fact unknown his wife for the first 55 years of their marriage. Mr. Brady enlisted in the military after high school and trained to be a pilot all over the United States throughout 1943-44, eventually winding up as co-pilot on a B-29 Flying Fortress called the Raidin Maiden II based on Tinian Island as part of the 468th Bomber Group. His squadron conducted seven bombing raids on Japan in July and August of 1945, the last one on Hikari Naval Arsenal on August 14, 1945, his 22nd birthday. It was one of the last bombing raids of World War II. In a rare conversation about the war, he described the missions as ""seven hours of boredom, followed by seven minutes of terror, followed by seven hours of boredom."" Katherine A. Stocker and Robert C. Brady were married on June 17, 1950 and honeymooned at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, Colorado. They settled in Franklin Lakes, in 1965, after he was hired by Pfister Chemical, a small specialty chemical manufacturer in Ridgefield. Traveling the world to buy and sell chemicals, Mr. Brady held the position of general manager at Pfister until he was nearly 80, never once calling in sick. Mr. Brady joined the Ridgewood Country Club in 1972, and was a director on the club's board from 1989-92. He was elected to the Franklin Lakes Borough Council in 1981 and served until 1992, and was the police commissioner for much of that time. He coached youth football for four years, and was active at the Most Blessed Sacrament Church. His brother John, who goes by Jack, remembers that his older brother Bob stuck up for him and kept older boys ""from beating the hell out of me because I was kind of a smart aleck."" In a recent phone conversation, Jack, now 88 and living in Omaha, says his brother had one last piece of advice for him on aging and facing death. ""Don't worry about it,"" Bob told him, ""you can't get out of this life alive."""

2014-10-26T00:00:00Z,"BIRLE--Mary McDaniels, beloved wife, mother, grandmother, sister and friend, died at home on October 21 in Village of Golf, Florida of Hodgkin's Lymphoma. She was 77. A native of San Francisco, Mary attended Convent of the Sacred Heart in San Francisco as a young child and, after moving to Atherton, California, Convent of the Sacred Heart in Menlo Park. Mary graduated from The University of California, Berkeley, in 1960, where she was a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. During her college years, she lived in Paris and studied at the Sorbonne. Mary married her husband, Jim, in Atherton in 1961. After marrying, she and Jim lived in Los Gatos, California with their four children. A devoted and loving mother and wife for more than 53 years, Mary found endless energy in the service of others. She was an active community volunteer and a member of the Junior League of San Jose and the Summit League in Los Gatos. In the early 70s, Mary was recognized by the City of San Jose as Young Woman of the year. In 1977, Mary and her family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut where, with the exception of two wonderful years in Louisville, Kentucky, they lived for more than 30 years. Mary was a member of The Green Fingers Garden Club, The Field Club of Greenwich and The Round Hill Club. She was a longtime board member of the Family Center of Greenwich, and a founding board member of the Cure for Lymphoma Foundation in New York. Mary enjoyed summers at their home in Charlestown, Rhode Island, where she loved to bird watch. She was committed to the preservation of Rhode Island's tidal ponds and wetlands and was a generous supporter of The Nature Conservancy. Since 2004, Mary resided in Village of Golf, Florida with her husband, Jim. In 2013, Mary and Jim made Belvedere, California their second home. Insatiably curious, there was virtually no subject beyond her knowing command. She read voraciously and participated in book clubs throughout her life. Mary had a lifelong passion for the history and culture of Native Americans. She enjoyed a good laugh and would find humor in the most challenging of circumstances. She loved to cook, garden, travel, and play tennis and golf. Most of all, she loved Labrador Retrievers, which she bred and showed for many years. In later years, Mary's great love of music led to her support of the Conservatory of Music at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida. Mary inspired all in her presence with an indomitable inner strength, wisdom, dignity, and humility. Her countless acts of generosity, large and small, were always done modestly and quietly. She was much loved and leaves many dear friends, each of whom she cherished. Mary is survived by her husband, Jim; her sons Jim Birle, Jr. (Judy) of Summit, New Jersey, and John Birle (Sue) of Laguna Niguel, California; daughters Anne Veh (George) of Mill Valley, California, and Lexie Clifford (Scott) of Kentfield, California; grandchildren Katie, Melissa, Jimmy, Emily, Peter, Christopher, Matthew, Claire, Megan, Jack and Alex; and her brother, Fr. John Lea McDaniels of Melbourne, Australia. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations in Mary's memory can be made to: Cipotes Honduras Mission, c/o Hope for a Healthier Humanity, PO Box 90547, Staten Island, NY 10309 www.hopeforahealthier humanity.org or Hospice of Palm Beach County/Trustbridge, 5300 East Ave., West Palm Beach, FL., 33407 www.hpbc.com."
2014-10-26T00:00:00Z,"BAUMSLAG--Gilbert. Distinguished Professor Emeritus, CCNY, died October 20, after a brief illness. Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, he earned his B.Sc. Honours (Masters) and D.Sc. from the University of Witwatersrand, and his Ph.D. from the University of Manchester. He has given keynote addresses in most conferences in infinite group theory on five continents. He worked with many mathematicians and had more than 30 doctoral students. He played tennis, golf and squash in adulthood but always regretted that he had not followed his first ambition, persuaded not to by his father who thought it frivolous: to play cricket for South Africa a game he followed throughout his lifetime. He first came to the U.S. to teach at Princeton and then moved on to NYU, CUNY, and Rice University before rejoining CUNY at City College in 1973 as Distinguished Professor, a classification limited to 175 and is described by CUNY as an exceptional scholar with an international reputation for scholarly and/or research excellence. He had several academic relationships including ETH in Zurich and the University of Warwick in the U.K. He was the author of more than 150 mathematical papers along with books and monographs. His research was supported for decades and for millions by the National Science Foundation. He was also the Founder and Director of the Center for Algorithms & Interactive Scientific Software (CAISS). He had a great fondness for Nantucket where he spent more than 25 years during school vacations and holidays writing papers, exploring problems on his famous 500lb blackboard installed on the office wall of his his beloved old house on Darling Street. He was enormously fond of many friends on Nantucket with whom he shared a lot of important and silly experiences. One such was playing cricket on Darling Street on a hot August night with four amateurs at the game.There were no winners. There were also no losers. He also loved having lunch at The Opera House where there was no rush, no impatience, and just great food, a great atmosphere, all under the guidance of the renowned Gwen Gaillard. And the always present lure of the Atlantic Ocean was not to be ignored. He loved the land of his birth and was truly happy when the government was transformed by the release of Nelson Mandela. He went to Johannesburg whenever possible for more than 40 years not only to see old friends but also to encourage math projects in the country. He is survived by his wife, Mary Kennedy Baumslag, Len Cohen of South Africa, his childhood partner in many misadventures; his well respected friend, Howard Siegel,M.D. and a lot of beloved friends and colleagues, in New York, on Nantucket and around the world; devoted and accomplished former students, several nieces and nephews, and a few remote blood relatives. No service is planned at this time."

Sondra had the enthusiasm and lust for life of someone many decades younger - with a great sense of humor and timing, and an amazing attitude towards life that probably extended hers by at least a decade. She was always ready to laugh, eat, drink, shop and keep right on having fun. Sondra seemed just as much in love with her beloved partner, Sam Citron, now, as she was when they first met almost 25 years ago. Seeing them together was always like seeing two teenagers in love. Sam's term of endearment for her was ""Little Bird"", an affectionate pet name that endured through the years. Sondra (a/k/a my fabulous mother) had a remarkable ability to focus only upon a positive outcome for any situation and to navigate her way towards that best possible outcome. In doing so, she would also take the rest of us along with her for the ride and turn us into believers. She was a great cook, a loving and never-overbearing mother, and for 37 years, she was the wife of Jack Winter, whom she married only 10 days after their chance meeting on a Midtown street in 1952. She is survived by her son Gregg and daughter-in-law Barbara, and by her loving partner Sam, with whom she spent her happiest years. From the start, once Gregg married Barbara in 1999, Sondra and Barbara became best friends and had their own unique and special bond. To the very end, her hunger to live and to enjoy even a shrinking number of good hours each day makes it hard to accept that there will no more long phone calls, and no more visits to her apartment where she would hold court in her pink bedroom, with all of us talking and watching TV together and commenting on everyone and everything and laughing, and laughing..."

2014-10-28T00:00:00Z,"HOOGENBOOM--Ari, historian, died October 25 of complications from mesothelioma. He was 86. He was born in Richmond Hill, Queens, on November 28, 1927. He attended public schools, graduated from John Adams High School in 1945, then attended Atlantic Union College, graduating in 1949. There, he met Olive Youngberg, and they married August 28, 1949. Ari received his MA (1951) and his PhD (1958) from Columbia University. He was an instructor and assistant professor at the University of Texas at El Paso (1956-58), an instructor, assistant professor, associate professor and full professor at Penn State (1958-68), and a full professor at Brooklyn College (1968-98), where he was chairman of the history department from 1968-74. He was also a Guggenheim fellow (1965-66) and the visiting George Bancroft professor of American history at the University of Gottingen, Germany (1991-92). Ari had a distinguished publishing career. He made a splash in 1960 with a tongue-in-cheek article in the Wisconsin Magazine of History positing that scholars had overlooked the true cause of the Civil War: the burgeoning popularity of beards, which had made Northerners and Southerners alike more aggressive. His first book was ""Outlawing the Spoils: A History of the Civil Service Reform Movement, 1865-1883"" (1961). He co-authored ""The Enterprising Colonials: Society on the Eve of the Revolution (with William S. Sachs, 1965), ""A History of the ICC: From Panacea to Palliative"" (with Olive Hoogenboom, 1976) and ""A History of Pennsylvania"" (with Phillip S. Klein, 1973). He wrote two defining books on Rutherford B. Hayes: ""The Presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes"" (1988) and ""Rutherford B. Hayes: Warrior and President"" (1995; Ohioana Book Award, 1996). He continued to be a productive scholar after his retirement, publishing ""Rutherford B. Hayes: One of the Good Colonels"" (1999) and ""Gustavus Vasa Fox of the Union Navy: A Biography"" (2008). In the past few years, he has worked with his wife, Olive, on her book, ""Washington Women: The Woodbury Sisters,"" giving her the same assistance that she had given him on a number of his books. They finished revisions shortly before his death. He is survived by his wife, Olive; his children, Lynn, Ari Jr. and Jan; his granddaughters, Amelia, Charlotte, and Calliope, and countless friends. His sister, Clara, predeceased him. A memorial service will be held November 8 at 2pm at the First Unitarian Church, 116 Pierrepont St., Brooklyn, where he was a member of the choir for over 30 years. Wake Service and Visiting Hours Tuesday, October 28, 6-9pm at Raccuglia & Son Funeral Home Inc., 321-323 Court Street, Brooklyn. 718-855-7737."

2014-10-28T00:00:00Z,"ALAGAPPAN--Alagappa, A former United Nations official and founder of the Hindu Temple movement in North America, died in New Hyde Park, New York on Friday, October 24. He was 89 years old. Born in Kanadukathan, Tamil Nadu, India, Alagappan held five academic and professional degrees from institutions across the world. He received his B.A. and M.A. from Presidency College in Chennai, India and his M.Sc. from the London School of Economics. He later earned his LL.B. and was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in London. Finally, he earned his Ph.D. in International Relations from New York University. While studying in London, Alagappan also worked as a journalist for the British Broadcasting Corporation, during which time he interviewed the Pope. Upon returning to India, he declined a bank job to work as a journalist for the Hindu Newspaper. He then applied to work at the United Nations, whose mission to promote world peace and socioeconomic equality resonated deeply with him. As a career official with the United Nations, first in Bangkok and then in New York, Alagappan served as Chief of the Water Resources Section and later Deputy Director of the Natural Resources and Energy Division. He was also elected Chairman of the staff of ten thousand employees of the United Nations. In his thirty years of service to the United Nations, Alagappan valued the opportunity to travel, visiting more than 90 countries during his career. After leaving the United Nations, Alagappan pursued a life of social service inspired by his professional career and his personal devotion to Hinduism. He maintained the deep conviction that faith heals and inspires. As Founder of the Hindu Temple Society of North America, he sought to create sacred spaces for worshippers visiting and living in the United States. In 1977, he established the Maha Vallabha Ganapati Temple in Flushing, New York. This granite stone temple was the first authentic Hindu Temple in North America with classical Indian architecture. Alagappan proposed that a large ecumenical icon at the temple's entrance display symbols of various worldwide religions. He said, ""Just as all streams lead to the same greater body of water, and all mountain trails to the same summit, so do all world religions lead to the same God."" Alagappan's most recent projects include the establishment of Arupadai Veedu, a single temple complex that houses replicas of six pilgrimage sites in an urban neighborhood in Chennai, making it accessible to people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. He also established the Saraswati Temple devoted to the transmission of knowledge and education. Alagappan maintained that education was the greatest gift parents could give their children. He credited his mother with instilling in him this principle, which guided his life and the lives of his children. His wife Visalakshi Alagappan said, ""When I think of my husband, I think of Mahatma Gandhi's quotation: 'My life is my message.' Alagappan is survived by his beloved wife of 59 years, four children, Kumar, Arun, Vairam and Meena, and seven granddaughters, Lakshmi, Jyothi, Visala, Serena, Kaya, Uma and Vimala. Witty, kind, cheerful, dynamic, and creative, Dr. Alagappa Alagappan will be dearly missed by his family and friends. All who knew him were inspired by his compassion, magnetic morality, pragmatic spirit, and unwavering determination. Dr. Alagappa Alagappan's final words remind us of how he lived his life and urged others to live theirs. They are a testament to his avid pursuit of education, his loyalty to the United Nations, his decades-long commitment to temple projects, his dedication to social service, and his profound, pure love for his family. These words will serve as his legacy and epitaph: ""I'm trying my best."""

2014-10-29T00:00:00Z,"WOLF--Charles R.,a security analyst at Needham and Company, died on October 28, 2014, of lung cancer. Born in Mason City, Iowa, Charlie shed any evidence of his midwestern roots as soon as he arrived at Harvard, where he earned an AB, MBA and DBA. A brilliant intellect with an irresistible smile and a twinkle in his eye, he shared his gifts by educating two generations of Wall Street at the Columbia Business School, rising from assistant professor in 1966 to professor. His articles on financial economics and decision theory were published in major academic journals and he was co-author of ""The Role of Private Placements in Corporate Finance,"" published by the Harvard University Press. On a leave from Columbia, intending to incorporate the practical tools of securities analysis into a course, he became an analyst at CS First Boston in 1984, covering the personal computer industry. A Wall Street Journal ""Heard on the Street Column"" in 1986 featured him as the rookie analyst from academia who made good. Between 1988 and 1993, he was elected to Institutional Investor's prestigious ""All American Research Team"" in the personal computer industry category. His signature publication, Wolf Bytes, has provided in-depth analysis of significant industry issues for years. Charlie, nicknamed ""The Wolfman,"" brought a level of professionalism and rigor that raised the bar in every Research Department he inhabited, including a stint at UBS. His quests for data, and the resulting ten-year models, were legendary. When he completed an opus, he was as giddy as a kid. When he discovered flawed data, his colleagues heard his growl. He is survived by his devoted wife of almost 23 years, Margot; a brother Ronald; a step-daughter Alexandra (Dr. Hao Vuong); a step-son, Adam Sitkoff; and a grandson Gavin Sitkoff-Vuong. Services to be held Friday, October 31, at 11:30am, at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue. Those who wish may donate to Weill Cornell Medical College in care of Dr. Ronald Scheff's research fund."

His tireless efforts to ensure the vibrancy of the art community in New York City while simultaneously creating a renowned body of his own work remain unmatched. His imprint and the mark of his supportive legacy will continue to be felt at MoMA PS1 where Slaughter was instrumental in leading the institution. Slaughter also served on the board of directors of the Public Theater, and was a director at the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation through which he generously supported organizations such as The Drawing Center, Naked Angels, and the Studio Museum in Harlem, as well as MoMA PS1 and MoMA. Slaughter will be remembered for his tenacity, energy and great wit, and as a driving force in his SoHo community.

He was a proud member of the varsity squash and chess teams as a student there. From 1954 to 1964, he worked in the Brooklyn Navy Yards helping in the construction of numerous Navy vessels. He then accepted a position with the New York City Board of Education as a master machinist, where he worked until his retirement in 1984 at the age of 57. Then, he began his second career as an investor, spending good portions of each day working on his portfolio and looking for companies he believed in. It was an endeavor he enjoyed passionately till his last days. He also enjoyed playing poker and spending time with his beautiful wife of 60 years, Erna. He would often declare how blessed he was to have her. They split their time between homes in Tom's River, NJ and Melbourne, FL since 1994. His legacy lives on through his loving wife, Erna, a son Joseph and four beautiful grandchildren, Ariana, Mason, Colton and Hope. Memorial services will be held at a later date.

2014-10-29T00:00:00Z,"ALAGAPPAN--Alagappa, A former United Nations official and founder of the Hindu Temple movement in North America, died in New Hyde Park, New York on Friday, October 24. He was 89 years old. Born in Kanadukathan, Tamil Nadu, India, Alagappan held five academic and professional degrees from institutions across the world. He received his B.A. and M.A. from Presidency College in Chennai, India and his M.Sc. from the London School of Economics. He later earned his LL.B. and was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in London. Finally, he earned his Ph.D. in International Relations from New York University. While studying in London, Alagappan also worked as a journalist for the British Broadcasting Corporation, during which time he interviewed the Pope. Upon returning to India, he declined a bank job to work as a journalist for the Hindu Newspaper. He then applied to work at the United Nations, whose mission to promote world peace and socioeconomic equality resonated deeply with him. As a career official with the United Nations, first in Bangkok and then in New York, Alagappan served as Chief of the Water Resources Section and later Deputy Director of the Natural Resources and Energy Division. He was also elected Chairman of the staff of ten thousand employees of the United Nations. In his thirty years of service to the United Nations, Alagappan valued the opportunity to travel, visiting more than 90 countries during his career. After leaving the United Nations, Alagappan pursued a life of social service inspired by his professional career and his personal devotion to Hinduism. He maintained the deep conviction that faith heals and inspires. As Founder of the Hindu Temple Society of North America, he sought to create sacred spaces for worshippers visiting and living in the United States. In 1977, he established the Maha Vallabha Ganapati Temple in Flushing, New York. This granite stone temple was the first authentic Hindu Temple in North America with classical Indian architecture. Alagappan proposed that a large ecumenical icon at the temple's entrance display symbols of various worldwide religions. He said, ""Just as all streams lead to the same greater body of water, and all mountain trails to the same summit, so do all world religions lead to the same God."" Alagappan's most recent projects include the establishment of Arupadai Veedu, a single temple complex that houses replicas of six pilgrimage sites in an urban neighborhood in Chennai, making it accessible to people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. He also established the Saraswati Temple devoted to the transmission of knowledge and education. Alagappan maintained that education was the greatest gift parents could give their children. He credited his mother with instilling in him this principle, which guided his life and the lives of his children. His wife Visalakshi Alagappan said, ""When I think of my husband, I think of Mahatma Gandhi's quotation: 'My life is my message.' Alagappan is survived by his beloved wife of 59 years, four children, Kumar, Arun, Vairam and Meena, and seven granddaughters, Lakshmi, Jyothi, Visala, Serena, Kaya, Uma and Vimala. Witty, kind, cheerful, dynamic, and creative, Dr. Alagappa Alagappan will be dearly missed by his family and friends. All who knew him were inspired by his compassion, magnetic morality, pragmatic spirit, and unwavering determination. Dr. Alagappa Alagappan's final words remind us of how he lived his life and urged others to live theirs. They are a testament to his avid pursuit of education, his loyalty to the United Nations, his decades-long commitment to temple projects, his dedication to social service, and his profound, pure love for his family. These words will serve as his legacy and epitaph: ""I'm trying my best."""

Born in Mason City, Iowa, Charlie shed any evidence of his midwestern roots as soon as he arrived at Harvard, where he earned an AB, MBA and DBA. A brilliant intellect with an irresistible smile and a twinkle in his eye, he shared his gifts by educating two generations of Wall Street at the Columbia Business School, rising from assistant professor in 1966 to professor. His articles on financial economics and decision theory were published in major academic journals and he was co-author of ""The Role of Private Placements in Corporate Finance,"" published by the Harvard University Press. On a leave from Columbia, intending to incorporate the practical tools of securities analysis into a course, he became an analyst at CS First Boston in 1984, covering the personal computer industry. A Wall Street Journal ""Heard on the Street Column"" in 1986 featured him as the rookie analyst from academia who made good. Between 1988 and 1993, he was elected to Institutional Investor's prestigious ""All American Research Team"" in the personal computer industry category. His signature publication, Wolf Bytes, has provided in-depth analysis of significant industry issues for years. Charlie, nicknamed ""The Wolfman,"" brought a level of professionalism and rigor that raised the bar in every Research Department he inhabited, including a stint at UBS. His quests for data, and the resulting ten-year models, were legendary. When he completed an opus, he was as giddy as a kid. When he discovered flawed data, his colleagues heard his growl. He is survived by his devoted wife of almost 23 years, Margot; a brother Ronald; a step-daughter Alexandra (Dr. Hao Vuong); a step-son, Adam Sitkoff; and a grandson Gavin Sitkoff-Vuong. Services to be held Friday, October 31, at 11:30am, at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue.

Born June 12, 1915, the second of four sons of Samuel and Sarah Jacoff, he is survived by his sons Michael (Jeanne) and Daniel, Daniel's sons Benjamin and Samuel, and many nieces and nephews. Graduating from City College of New York in 1935, he went to work with his father who had shortly before established a small tool manufacturing business, essentially a two-man operation, where Sydney had already been helping out part-time. As the enterprise grew, all his brothers joined them over the next decade or so. Together they built it into the still flourishing Great Neck Saw Manufacturers, now run by a third generation, through their dedication and hard work. Hap- piest when at the wheel of the Sarah in a stiff breeze, if Helen was with him, or, again in her company, gazing out over the Provencal landscape and discussing what the day's excursion should be. He also took great pleasure in a close circle of extraordinary friends with whom he and Helen shared many good times and some difficult ones as well over many decades. He also experienced his share of adversities most notably, the long, ever deepening darkness of Helen's Alzheimer's. A remarkable ability to maintain a positive spirit in the face of setbacks and a gift for connecting with people helped sustain him through these times.

Sondra had the enthusiasm and lust for life of someone many decades younger - with a great sense of humor and timing, and an amazing attitude towards life that probably extended hers by at least a decade. She was always ready to laugh, eat, drink, shop and keep right on having fun. Sondra seemed just as much in love with her beloved partner, Sam Citron, now, as she was when they first met almost 25 years ago. Seeing them together was always like seeing two teenagers in love. Sam's term of endearment for her was ""Little Bird"", an affectionate pet name that endured through the years. Sondra (a/k/a my fabulous mother) had a remarkable ability to focus only upon a positive outcome for any situation and to navigate her way towards that best possible outcome. In doing so, she would also take the rest of us along with her for the ride and turn us into believers. She was a great cook, a loving and never-overbearing mother, and for 37 years, she was the wife of Jack Winter, whom she married only 10 days after their chance meeting on a Midtown street in 1952. She is survived by her son Gregg and daughter-in-law Barbara, and by her loving partner Sam, with whom she spent her happiest years. From the start, once Gregg married Barbara in 1999, Sondra and Barbara became best friends and had their own unique and special bond. To the very end, her hunger to live and to enjoy even a shrinking number of good hours each day makes it hard to accept that there will be no more long phone calls, and no more visits to her apartment where she would hold court in her pink bedroom, with all of us talking and watching TV together and commenting on everyone and everything and laughing, and laughing..."

2014-11-02T00:00:00Z,"DONAHUE--Daniel James, A resident of Riverside, CT and Pacific Palisades, CA, Daniel J. Donahue died suddenly on October 21st in Pacific Palisades, CA. He was born in Chicago, Il on January 28, 1939. He was the eldest son of Donald F. Donahue, Sr. and Mary Fuller Donahue. He graduated from Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Il, and received a Congressional appointment to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point. After graduation, Dan completed Ranger and Paratrooper training at Fort Benning, GA, and Fort Campbell, KY. During his Army service, he was in charge of the Guerilla Warfare Training School in Korea from 1962-1963. Dan resigned from the Army in 1963 to pursue a career in finance. He joined Merrill Lynch where he worked for thirty-seven years. He started as a financial consultant in Chicago, and then became an office manager in Tacoma, WA, and then Manhattan. Next he took on the role of Director of General Services, and then became District Director in New England. During his early years at Merrill Lynch, he attained a Master's Degree in Business Administration from the University of Chicago. Dan retired from Merrill Lynch in 2000 and directed his energy to many activities, including continuing his career in the world of finance by founding the Fieldpoint Private Bank and Trust in Greenwich with his good friend, Dan Tully, and others. Dan served as founding Chairman from the bank's inception in 2008 until January 2013, after which he became Lead Director, and ultimately in May 2014, he became Chairman Emeritus. ""Duty, honor, country,"" West Point's motto, were guiding principles throughout Dan's life. Dan was once told as he was leaving the Army and dressing out of uniform that he ""looked like a soldier in civilian clothes,"" and he always tried to live up to the high ideals of West Point. Everywhere he lived or worked, Dan remained dedicated to a life of serving others and making the world a better place. He enjoyed being active in many charitable causes and community organizations. In Tacoma, WA, he chaired a town-wide fundraiser for all private and parochial high schools. In Greenwich, CT, he chaired the Republican Town Committee, was an early supporter of the Arch Street Teen Center, and was a founding board member of the Greenwich Point Conservancy. He was Parish Council President at St. Catherine of Siena, and a devoted member of the parish. In New York, he was the Chairman of the New York City Roundtable for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and was also Chairman for the Tri-State United Way. He was appointed to the Grace Commission in Washington, DC. One of his favorite experiences was to be in charge of Merrill Lynch's Scholarship Builder Program in Harlem. Through that program, he helped mentor a class of 25 students from kindergarten through their school years and beyond. Recently he attended the wedding of a student with great pride and joy. It was also in smaller, less notable ways that Dan lived these principles. He spoke out and wrote letters for less fortunate people to institutions that might not otherwise listen. Dan had a serious gravitas and sterling integrity that commanded respect, and yet his sharp wit and easy laugh made him beloved by all who knew him well. He loved reading and his book club, golfing and his partners, boating and fishing with his grandchildren, travelling the world, mentoring young people, providing advice to the many who came to him, and simply enjoying his family as an incredibly devoted husband, father, and grandfather. Dan and his wife, Judy, fell in love in high school and they celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary this year with all their children and grandchildren in Carmel, CA. He is survived by her and his children, Daniel, Joseph, and Laura, his daughter-in-law Katharine, and son-in-law Michael, and his seven grandchildren, Daniel, Charles, Samuel, Henry, Hannah, Connor, and Ryan. Dan is predeceased by his parents and brothers and by his infant daughter, Susan. Dan will be interred at West Point after a private funeral.

As a teenager she moved to New York City when her parents, Ben and Mary Bodne, bought the historic Algonquin Hotel, which became her new home. Throughout the years she contributed to the daily life of the Algonquin. With her great taste, sense of style and history, and passion for the arts she helped make the hotel a welcoming home-away-from-home for visitors from around the world, many of whom she befriended with her wit and warmth. An accomplished student, she graduated as valedictorian from The Calhoun School and later from Finch College in New York City. In 1955 she met Andrew A. Anspach at the Algonquin, and the following year on June 24th, midsummer night, they were married. She enjoyed the next fifty-seven years as his beloved wife. Although ""Bobbie,"" as some of her friends called her, loved both New York City and Charleston, she held a special place in her heart for Paris and especially London, where she often travelled with family and friends. She had a passion for London and New York theater and often reminisced about attending legendary opening nights. She is survived by her adored children, Elizabeth Carlson and Roxanna Anspach Devlin, and by her grandchildren, Annie and Margaret Carlson and Bennett, Emma, and William Devlin. She will also be greatly missed by her sister, Renee Mae Colby, by her nephews, Michael, Douglas, and David Colby, and by her devoted friends. A private funeral service will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel. In lieu of flowers, donations should be made to Save The Children or Heifer International."

2014-11-03T00:00:00Z,"SPITZER--Bernard, a civil engineer, innovative real estate developer and philanthropist who built millions of square feet of prime Manhattan buildings, died on November 1. According to a family spokesperson, Mr. Spitzer succumbed after a long battle with Parkinson's Disease. He was 90 years of age. Always grateful for the opportunities he received, he and his wife, Anne, established a family foundation, which endowed a new architecture and urban planning school at City College as well as the Hall of Human Origins at the American Museum of Natural History. They also funded stem cell research at Columbia University and Public Theater productions of Shakespeare in the Park, among many other philanthropic initiatives. Education was a priority for his parents, Molly and Morris, who emigrated from Austria to a Lower East Side tenement on East 5th Street after World War I. His father ran a printing business in the basement, with assistance from the young Bernard, who was fluent in five languages and could typeset in four. A gifted student, he attended a local Yeshiva and then Townsend Harris High School, from which he graduated at age 14. He received his Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from City College four years later. Initially assisting the war effort designing gyroscopically stabilized gun-mounts, he then joined the Navy, and was posted to heavily bombarded Bremen as a Lieutenant JG in naval counter-intelligence. After discharge from the Navy, he attended Columbia University on the G.I. bill, earning a Master of Science in Engineering in 1947 and then accepted a position as field supervisor for the colorful Russian builder, Sam Minskoff. With a few years of experience under his belt, he set out on his own, building Spitzer Engineering, one successful project leading to the next, into a successful family company. Beginning in Riverdale with a seven-story brick apartment house completed in 1954, he then constructed a 112-unit residence on the northern section of the Grand Concourse. In 1960 he and a business partner developed a 22-story co-op at 1050 Fifth Avenue opposite the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Eight more large-scale projects were developed from inception to completion over the next four decades. As described by real estate reporter Alan Oser in the December 15, 1991 New York Times, he was ""a civil engineer with a taste for esthetics and design, a reputation as an insightful taskmaster and a preference for residential buildings in Manhattan locations. If there is an unusual construction challenge, so much the better."" In 1962, he began development on the iconic 35-story apartment building at the corner of Central Park South and Seventh Avenue, a site diligently acquired parcel by parcel over many years after he spotted it from a taxicab window. Poring over drawings and coffee with long-term architect Michael Schimenti late one evening, he sketched a design for a distinctively curved structure stretching around the corner from Central Park South to broad Seventh Avenue. This provided maximum light, air and park views for the 310 residences and space for a curved driveway/port-cochere. One critic amiably suggested, ""It's a nice building, just too far from the beach."" ""But not too far from the park."" Mr. Spitzer wryly observed. After acquiring at auction the site of the former East Side Airlines Terminal at First Avenue between 37th and 38th Streets, Mr. Spitzer faced another formidable hurdle. While the zoning would allow some 865 apartments, making it the largest residential building in the city at the time (1989), connections to the Midtown tunnel ran like fault veins under a portion of the site. The result was The Corinthian, a 57-story curvilinear tower with an undulating facade of semi-circular windows gracefully secure on terra firma. Mr. Spitzer and partners purchased a Manhattan trophy commercial property, the Crown Building on Fifth Avenue across the street from Tiffany's, in 1991. The focus on commercial buildings in vibrant markets continued with the acquisition of two prime office properties in Washington, DC and one in Bethesda, MD. More recently, Spitzer Engineering acquired a retail condominium in SoHo and a development site in the Hudson Yards area. A voracious reader and enthusiastic interlocutor, Mr. Spitzer presided over the family dinner table, which became a field for discussion, debate, questioning authority and intellectual rigor. Meals were punctuated with Socratic discourse. Any appeal to authority or resort to ad hominem argumentation automatically lost the debate. Before Mr. Spitzer had a drafting or dining table, he had a saxophone, which he played in the band at Weinrib's resort in the Catskills. It was there, when both were teens, that he met Anne Goldhaber, a counselor at the children's camp. They married three years later, and recently celebrated their 69th wedding anniversary. They shared a passion for city life, classical music, tennis, skiing and literature - which Anne taught for decades at Hunter and Marymount Manhattan College. Reflecting his many interests, Mr. Spitzer served on the boards of the Juilliard School, the Museum of Jewish Heritage, the Hospital for Joint Diseases, the Michael J. Fox Foundation and others. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughter, Emily, a lawyer and former executive director of the National Health Law Program, his son, Daniel, a neurosurgeon, his son Eliot, former Attorney General and Governor of New York State, and seven grandchildren. Interment will be private. Funeral services will take place on Monday, November 3rd at 10am at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, Manhattan. In lieu of flowers, the Spitzer family would request that donations be made to the Michael J. Fox Foundation in memory of Bernard Spitzer."

2014-11-04T00:00:00Z,"SPITZER--Bernard, a civil engineer, innovative real estate developer and philanthropist who built millions of square feet of prime Manhattan buildings, died on November 1. According to a family spokesperson, Mr. Spitzer succumbed after a long battle with Parkinson's Disease. He was 90 years of age. Always grateful for the opportunities he received, he and his wife, Anne, established a family foundation, which endowed a new architecture and urban planning school at City College as well as the Hall of Human Origins at the American Museum of Natural History. They also funded stem cell research at Columbia University and Public Theater productions of Shakespeare in the Park, among many other philanthropic initiatives. Education was a priority for his parents, Molly and Morris, who emigrated from Austria to a Lower East Side tenement on East 5th Street after World War I. His father ran a printing business in the basement, with assistance from the young Bernard, who was fluent in five languages and could typeset in four. A gifted student, he attended a local Yeshiva and then Townsend Harris High School, from which he graduated at age 14. He received his Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from City College four years later. Initially assisting the war effort designing gyroscopically stabilized gun-mounts, he then joined the Navy, and was posted to heavily bombarded Bremen as a Lieutenant JG in naval counter-intelligence. After discharge from the Navy, he attended Columbia University on the G.I. bill, earning a Master of Science in Engineering in 1947 and then accepted a position as field supervisor for the colorful Russian builder, Sam Minskoff. With a few years of experience under his belt, he set out on his own, building Spitzer Engineering, one successful project leading to the next, into a successful family company. Beginning in Riverdale with a seven-story brick apartment house completed in 1954, he then constructed a 112-unit residence on the northern section of the Grand Concourse. In 1960 he and a business partner developed a 22-story co-op at 1050 Fifth Avenue opposite the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Eight more large-scale projects were developed from inception to completion over the next four decades. As described by real estate reporter Alan Oser in the December 15, 1991 New York Times, he was ""a civil engineer with a taste for esthetics and design, a reputation as an insightful taskmaster and a preference for residential buildings in Manhattan locations. If there is an unusual construction challenge, so much the better."" In 1962, he began development on the iconic 35-story apartment building at the corner of Central Park South and Seventh Avenue, a site diligently acquired parcel by parcel over many years after he spotted it from a taxicab window. Poring over drawings and coffee with long-term architect Michael Schimenti late one evening, he sketched a design for a distinctively curved structure stretching around the corner from Central Park South to broad Seventh Avenue. This provided maximum light, air and park views for the 310 residences and space for a curved driveway/port-cochere. One critic amiably suggested, ""It's a nice building, just too far from the beach."" ""But not too far from the park."" Mr. Spitzer wryly observed. After acquiring at auction the site of the former East Side Airlines Terminal at First Avenue between 37th and 38th Streets, Mr. Spitzer faced another formidable hurdle. While the zoning would allow some 865 apartments, making it the largest residential building in the city at the time (1989), connections to the Midtown tunnel ran like fault veins under a portion of the site. The result was The Corinthian, a 57-story curvilinear tower with an undulating facade of semi-circular windows gracefully secure on terra firma. Mr. Spitzer and partners purchased a Manhattan trophy commercial property, the Crown Building on Fifth Avenue across the street from Tiffany's, in 1991. The focus on commercial buildings in vibrant markets continued with the acquisition of two prime office properties in Washington, DC and one in Bethesda, MD. More recently, Spitzer Engineering acquired a retail condominium in SoHo and a development site in the Hudson Yards area. A voracious reader and enthusiastic interlocutor, Mr. Spitzer presided over the family dinner table, which became a field for discussion, debate, questioning authority and intellectual rigor. Meals were punctuated with Socratic discourse. Any appeal to authority or resort to ad hominem argumentation automatically lost the debate. Before Mr. Spitzer had a drafting or dining table, he had a saxophone, which he played in the band at Weinrib's resort in the Catskills. It was there, when both were teens, that he met Anne Goldhaber, a counselor at the children's camp. They married three years later, and recently celebrated their 69th wedding anniversary. They shared a passion for city life, classical music, tennis, skiing and literature - which Anne taught for decades at Hunter and Marymount Manhattan College. Reflecting his many interests, Mr. Spitzer served on the boards of the Juilliard School, the Museum of Jewish Heritage, the Hospital for Joint Diseases, the Michael J. Fox Foundation and others. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughter, Emily, a lawyer and former executive director of the National Health Law Program, his son, Daniel, a neurosurgeon, his son Eliot, former Attorney General and Governor of New York State, and seven grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, the Spitzer family would request that donations be made to the Michael J. Fox Foundation in memory of Bernard Spitzer."
