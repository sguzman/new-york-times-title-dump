1895-12-24T00:00:00Z,"The New-York World declares the message to be a blunder because it is not sustained by international law; because it puts the United States in a false position; because its assumption is absurd.

1895-12-24T00:00:00Z,We trust that President Cleveland will not be swerved from the firm and patriotic purpose of his Venezuelan message by the hysterical protests and panics of Wall Street.

1895-12-26T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Sala's stories were not always to be taken, nor did he always intend them to be taken, ""au pied de la lettre,"" as when, for example, he used to boast of having freed Mecklenburg-square -- where he resided for some years -- from the pest of Italian organ-grinders by simply going out in the dusk of the evening and planting little packets of poisoned macaroni here and there upon the doorsteps."
1895-12-26T00:00:00Z,"We printed on Sunday an account of the increasing expenses and taxation of the town of Cortlandt, which contains the village of Peekskill, and of the complaints of taxpayers and the effort to curtail various local extravagances through the agency of a newly created Board of Auditors."

1895-12-26T00:00:00Z,"My evening stand-by, The Evening Post, which was so fearfully ""rattled"" last Wednesday that it completely, lost its power to reason correctly, has not yet recovered.

Shakespeare 1609,"" in the left upper corner of the portrait of the poet now for a few days at the Antiquaries in Burlington House, we have at last an authentic picture of the bard in his habit as he lived.

1895-12-26T00:00:00Z,"The mere statement that on the 1st of January the separate departments of ""Charities"" and of ""Correction"" are to take the place of the old Department of ""Charities and Correction"" gives little idea of the full plan for simplifying the public service in relation to those branches, especially if we take into account that feature of it which contemplates turning over to the State the care of the insane."

And a strange thing about it is that one big estate will produce only common stuff, while a little one close by may be making the very finest spirit possible, at six, seven, or eight shillings a gallon.

1895-12-27T00:00:00Z,"Entering rivers to spawn, going down to the sea, and re-entering the rivers, constitutes, shortly, the life history of the salmon. Speaking generally, it feeds but little in fresh water, and loses weight; in the sea it feeds ravenously, and increases at a most remarkable rate.

They are also less intelligent and forgiving than a dog if unintentionally kicked or trodden on."
1895-12-27T00:00:00Z,"TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Dec. 26. -- The people of this place do not show much enthusiasm over the trolley subject, as was attested by a special meeting held Christmas Eve to discuss the matter before the Village Trustees.

Beyond the two Assembly balls, the Cinderella dances, the Old Guard ball, and the Patriarchs' dance there is little to look forward to.

1896-01-05T00:00:00Z,"In America the point now is reached where rather than to say as a people that cycling is ""in our midst,"" it is more expressive at the conditions to state that we are in the midst of cycling -- fairly launched into an era of self-propulsion.
