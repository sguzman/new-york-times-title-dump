Then I say that the rights of Ilungary warn restricted in ancient times not to a race but to a class-to a class of nobles-not to a taco prop erly called who carne out a thousand years ago from Aein, because in the of the Magyars were men of every race which settled and remained in the flange. rian territory. There were nobles among the , Sclnves, Gernrana, Wallachians, and the poor who were deprived of their Constitutional rights, warn not only Sclaves and Croats, but Magyars. Tlteroforo it was not a privilege of races but of , of of nobility, to have an interest in the ancient Constitu rights of Ilungary. Now that single class of men -a mere handful, to which I, by the changes of faro and circumstances happen to belong-could never have been sufficient to maintain the rights of tire country against the continual encroachment of the direc. lion, which it is so much in the nature of the house of Austria to exercise, that during all the centuries of its existence not a single man appeared in history out of the of Austria, who was nut the enemy of dom and of popular rights. So, having seen that that class of men was not to maintain the pop ular rights, and chiefly ' having the conviction it ie oat advantageous to have liberty rights n privilege of a class, but that it become the com mon men in the country, it was our (fret duty of the revolution to abolish all these privileges and to .thorn by the common broad basis liberty-liberty for the people of the whole country, without any as to what Church a man prays in, or what tongue ho speaks.

1852-06-12T00:03:58Z,"The Whig State Convention met last night and was well attended. Great enthusiasm prevailed.

1852-06-14T00:03:58Z,"Sir HARRY SMITH has arrived in England. A gratifying reception was given him at Cape town previous to his embarkation--showing that the colonists appreciate his services better than the Home Government. Sir HARRY considers that the coup de grace has been given to the Kaflir war by the late operations; but it would seem, by latest advices from the seat of war, that the enemy are as active as ever."

1852-06-14T00:03:58Z,"COTTON--On Saturday, (say WRIGHT, GANDY Co.) the demand continued active, and of the sales made, speculators and exporters took a fair quantity--prices remaining as before.

The result of the Frankfort and London loan has not yet transpired with certainty."
1852-06-14T00:03:58Z,"The ten days later intelligence from California, which we publish this morning, presents many items of interest.

1852-06-15T00:03:58Z,"THE BOARD OF ALDERMEN.--AS this evening is the time for the regular meeting of the Common Council, it is possible, but not probable, that a meeting may be had and an election provided.

Medical skill proved quite useless, and with the most horrible convulsions and agonies he died."
1852-06-15T00:03:58Z,The intimations we have of the approaching Whig National Convention are quite contradictory enough to puzzle the shrewdest prescience. In the most emphatic terms we are assured that delegates from the South will insist upon the introduction and adoption of a Platform before the ballotings for a candidate commence.

1852-06-15T00:03:58Z,"It seems that we are about to have another ""flare up"" with Portugal in relation to the St. Ubes ""salt trade,"" and that Mr. HADDOCK, our Minister at Lisbon, has already notified that Government, in relation to the matter. Before we get into another difficulty with Portugal we had better settle off old scores. The case of the claimants of the brig General Armstrong, against the Portuguese has not yet been settled up."
1852-06-15T00:03:58Z,"The public mind here is much agitated with news and speculations on the Egyptian question. It really has an importance much greater than what appears upon the surface.

1852-06-15T00:03:58Z,"Mr. A. G. SLOO will arrive here in a few days, and we shall then know something as to his contract for the construction and use of roads across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. There is some doubt whether his contract has been actually completed or will be."
1852-06-15T00:03:58Z,"There has been nothing more lamentably worthless than the various treatises upon the art of politeness and the science of etiquette, which have vainly striven to convert a boor into a gentleman by the foolishness of preaching. CASTIOLIONE, as long ago as the days of PIZARRO and CORTEZ, invented the idea in his book upon the ""Courtier;"" and CHESTERFIELD introduced it into England in his famous letters."

Articles not removed by this morning will be seized. The awnings are not considered among the obstructions."
1852-06-16T00:03:58Z,"We look back with wonder to the days when Croton was not. In that time of miserable deprivation, it is a mystery how New-Yorkers lived. How parched tongues were able to articulate on 'Change, or thunder in theatre, or spout in City Hall, or lisp in boudoir is also inexplicable. How even the font of tears was supplied is not easily told, much less how thirst was quenched or abluons performed."
1852-06-16T00:03:58Z,"One cannot help reflecting on the law-abidng patience of this people, as he rides past the PERRINE nuisance in Broadway, on a hot summer's day. A single man setting five hundred and seventeen thousand citizens, and strangers in pro portion, at absolute defiance, and not a mob organized or a single stone torn up save by the hated man himself and his troop of laborers."
1852-06-16T00:03:58Z,"A sultry day like yesterday may reasonably turn attention to the cool breezes of the Hudson and Connecticut, and the bracing sea air around the coast. The speed of the rail car loses half its at traction to the business traveller on such days, and the whole of it to the pleasure seeker, in comparison with the commodious and palace-like steamer The effect upon the business of the latter is magic like."
1852-06-17T00:03:58Z,"The intelligence by the Europa is devoid of even ordinary interest. Political news there is none. The Australian emigration continues and increases at a rapid rate; ship-builders and capitalists purveying for it liberally.

We know that despotism, cow-ardly as cruel, fears the spell of the name you have illustrated, and dares not,even though it be borne by defenceless women, permit its existence on the Eastern Continent."

1852-06-17T00:03:58Z,"The delightful weather of these days is an invitation from Nature to come out into the fields and forests, and meet her at home. Leafy June was never in lovelier trim to entertain the wanderer.

The preferences for SCOTT as the nominee of the Whigs are gaining ground very fast, and there is little doubt of his nomination.

1852-06-17T00:03:58Z,"It is amusing to note how bitterly Mr. BUCHANAN refers to the Baltimore Convention. "" Men,"" he says, in his letter to the Washington meeting, ""'Men are but the creatures of a day, whilst principles are eternal."" Certainly, a day, and even a few hours of a day, sufficed for the parturition of FRANKLIN PIERCE,"

1852-06-17T00:03:58Z,"The Democratic enthusiasm for PIERCE melts under the solstitial temperature. The furor of the first few days has calmed down to the standard of reflection.
