2010-11-08T00:00:00Z,"LOS ANGELES - With little fanfare, Hollywood's movie and television production companies and its principal actors unions early on Sunday morning said they had agreed tentatively to a new three-year contract that provides a 6 percent increase in wages over three years, and increases health and benefits contributions by the companies. The agreement comes well in advance of the current contract's expiration, in June 2011, and follows weeks of closed-door bargaining between the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and both the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Radio and Television Artists. The early settlement points to a new mood in Hollywood labor relations, which have become less confrontational as both companies and unions try to cope with softer economic conditions. In late 2007, movie and television writers began a three-month strike, then members of the Screen Actors Guild worked for months without a contract during a contentious bargaining period. This time around, the actors guild bargained in tandem with a sister guild, the federation, and reached a tentative deal in a relatively trouble-free process. The new contract, which also provides for expanded coverage in the new media area, is subject to approval by members of the two unions. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2010-11-08T00:00:00Z,"A group of about 30 people gathered on Saturday afternoon in front of the Lyceum Theater to protest a matinee of the new Broadway musical ''The Scottsboro Boys,'' which retells the story of nine African-Americans between 12 and 19 who were falsely convicted of raping two white women in Alabama in 1931. The show, written by the celebrated team of John Kander and the late Fred Ebb and directed by the Tony-winning director Susan Stroman, uses the minstrel tradition to tell the story of how racism infected the judicial system. The protesters, organized by the Freedom Party, argued that the use of minstrelsy and blackface were racist. Ms. Stroman said she was disappointed that people who probably had not seen the musical misunderstood that the creators were not celebrating the minstrel tradition but rather using it to reveal the evils of the system."

Dickinson, Jr., died in 1996. She was born Mary Elizabeth Harrington on November 30, 1920, in Mansfield, Ohio, to Alfred Irving and Mary Crawford Harrington. A graduate of The Bishop's School in La Jolla, California, and Bennington College, she served as a Pharmacist's Mate, 2nd Class, in the United States Navy during World War II. Stationed at the US Naval Hospital in Honolulu, Mrs. Dickinson vividly recalled seeing the ships at Pearl Harbor set off their artillery in jubilant celebration of V-J Day. Betty, as her friends and family knew her, relished new experiences. An avid photographer and watercolorist, she traveled to every continent on Earth, including a 2008 voyage to Antarctica. She also obtained her private pilot certificate when she was in her fifties, reasoning, ""If something happened to your pilot, how dumb would you feel flying around, waiting to run out of gas? It's so stupid not to be able to do something."" A competitive sailor and golfer, Mrs. Dickinson won the club championship at Arcola Country Club in 1968 and, later that year, scored a hole-in-one. She and her husband were pictured on the front page of The New York Times in October, 1980, along with other survivors of the burning and sinking of the M.V. Prinsendam off the coast of Alaska. After their fourteen hour ordeal in a lifeboat had drawn to a close and all were declared safe, Betty recalled the scene aboard the doomed liner in a telephone interview from Sitka: ""It was just like what you'd see in a B-movie. The only person missing was Tallulah Bankhead."" A former trustee of both Kent School in Kent, Connecticut, and Bennington College, Betty will be sorely missed by all who knew her great wit and quiet generosity. She is survived by her daughters Ann B. Dickinson and her husband Richard Purington, of Ridgewood, New Jersey and Tracy H. Dickinson of Park Ridge, New Jersey, by her granddaughter Amanda Turner Phillips and her husband Briggs, of Burlington, Vermont, by her grandson David Dickinson Turner, of New York, and by her great-grandson Crawford Dickinson Phillips of Burlington. She also leaves a nephew, Peter Strachan and his wife Linda and nieces Emily Strachan and Nancy Strachan, and Nancy's husband Peter Bland, all of California. In addition to her husband Fairleigh S. ""Dick"" Dickinson, Jr., Mrs. Dickinson was predeceased by her son Fairleigh S. ""Terry"" Dickinson, III, by an infant son, James Dickinson, and by her sister Eleanor ""Bunny"" Strachan. She was also preceded in death by her beloved cat, the debonair and peripatetic Bucky. The funeral service will be held at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, Edgartown, MA., on Thursday, November 11 at 11:00am. Interment at Tower Hill Cemetery, Edgartown, will be private.

2010-11-10T13:48:33Z,"In Revlon's 1952 ad for the Fire & Ice Collection, Richard Avedon photographed model-of-the-moment Dorian Leigh in a sparkling silver gown framed by an amorphous tuft of red fabric (a copy of a Balenciaga cape), her hands drawing attention to her blood-colored manicure and lipstick. One of the most indelible ads in fashion history, the image was part of a niche campaign that included a Peggy Olsen-worthy tagline - ""Are you made for Fire & Ice?"" - and a bizarre questionnaire that asked, 'Have you ever wanted to wear an ankle bracelet?' and 'Does gypsy music make you sad?' While a lot has changed since 1952, Fire & Ice has a new shelf life now that Revlon has re-released three ""lip-and-tip"" pairings ($4.79 - $ 8.99). The ad, shot by Mario Testino, restages the original, with a few notable exceptions - the actress Jessica Biel stands in for Leigh, ankle bracelets are so last century, and that dress is no knockoff."

It's so stupid not to be able to do something."" A competitive sailor and golfer, Mrs. Dickinson won the club championship at Arcola Country Club in 1968 and, later that year, scored a hole-in-one. She and her husband were pictured on the front page of The New York Times in October, 1980, along with other survivors of the burning and sinking of the M.V. Prinsendam off the coast of Alaska. After their fourteen hour ordeal in a lifeboat had drawn to a close and all were declared safe, Betty recalled the scene aboard the doomed liner in a telephone interview from Sitka: ""It was just like what you'd see in a B-movie. The only person missing was Tallulah Bankhead."" A former trustee of both Kent School in Kent, Connecticut, and Bennington College, Betty will be sorely missed by all who knew her great wit and quiet generosity. She is survived by her daughters Ann B. Dickinson and her husband Richard Purington, of Ridgewood, New Jersey and Tracy H. Dickinson of Park Ridge, New Jersey, by her granddaughter Amanda Turner Phillips and her husband Briggs, of Burlington, Vermont, by her grandson David Dickinson Turner, of New York, and by her great-grandson Crawford Dickinson Phillips of Burlington. She also leaves a nephew, Peter Strachan and his wife Linda and nieces Emily Strachan and Nancy Strachan, and Nancy's husband Peter Bland, all of California. In addition to her husband Fairleigh S. ""Dick"" Dickinson, Jr., Mrs. Dickinson was predeceased by her son Fairleigh S. ""Terry"" Dickinson, III, by an infant son, James Dickinson, and by her sister Eleanor ""Bunny"" Strachan. She was also preceded in death by her beloved cat, the debonair and peripatetic Bucky. The funeral service will be held at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, Edgartown, MA., on Thursday, November 11 at 11:00am. Interment at Tower Hill Cemetery, Edgartown, will be private. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate memorial donations to the Martha's Vineyard Boys and Girls Club, PO Box 654, Edgartown, MA 02539 or the Martha's Vineyard Museum, PO Box 1310, Edgartown, MA, 02539.

Beloved husband of 61 years to Barbara Strauss, he was the cherished father to John, Eileen and Sally and ""Papa"" to Jennifer, David, Jill, Amy, Alexandra, Ariel and Drew. Without resources for medical school, he pursued a career in finance, becoming a partner at Neuberger Berman, where he labeled himself a financial ""doctor"" promoting the financial health for his family, friends and clients. Many owe their way of life and opportunities to his exceptional judgment. His investment acumen first became apparent during the depression when at the age of eight he insisted on removing his entire savings from the bank just days before the crash. He went on to graduate early from Yale so he could join the Marines where he was one of three officers who accepted the Japanese surrender in China and received the Bronze Star. He was an avid reader with a keen mind who loved to share and discuss the latest history books. A strong believer in the value of education, he established several scholarship programs to enable needy students to pursue their dreams.

(Catchy phrase, no?) Though AMC ordered just six episodes of ''The Walking Dead'' for its first season, it seemed a virtual certainty that the show would rise again when its debut episode, broadcast on Halloween, broke a ratings record for that cable channel by drawing 5.3 million viewers, the largest audience it had recorded for an original series. AMC, which is also the home of the serial dramas ''Mad Men,'' ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Rubicon,'' said the second episode of ''The Walking Dead'' was watched by more than 4.7 million people. Season 2 of ''The Walking Dead'' will be 13 episodes long, AMC said, though no dates were given for the start of its production or its premiere. (Given that the show is produced in and around Atlanta, we'll assume AMC will do all it can to avoid filming in the hot, sweltering, zombie-makeup-melting summer.)"

2010-11-11T10:31:14Z,"For three decades the designer Anna Sui has tickled a hard-nosed industry with unabashed imagination and the kind of fairytale twinkle that is straight out of childhood ballerina boxes and teenage diaries. At their most fanciful, her clothes summon a dream of fun-loving womanhood, of idols and heroines: Janis Joplin, Marie Antoinette and Marisa Berenson on the dance floor, all in a single collection.

She started her eponymous collection in 1981 while working a day job, and opened her New York boutique in 1992 - the first of 300 sales outlets - just a year after her first runway show. Since 1997, Sui has also parlayed licensing deals in cosmetics, accessories and spin-off clothing lines that extend from Turkey to Japan. A new anthology published by Chronicle Books suggests that the lynchpin of her unique career is encyclopedic curiosity as much as commercial acumen, studied process and a deep respect for the techniques and traditions of her craft."

Standing athwart this progress, yelling ''Stop,'' is Longreads, a project created by Mark Armstrong, who is also the content chief at personal-finance site Bundle. Longreads' premise is to collect, collate and curate long-form journalism for online reading. It started in April 2009 as a Twitter hashtag. Users who found long (1,500+ word) articles or stories could append #longreads to the article's url and tweet it. Followers of @longreads would then get a daily river of lengthy, in-depth fiction and nonfiction from magazines, newspapers and online publications."

2010-11-11T00:00:00Z,"''Next to Normal,'' above, the Broadway show that became only the eighth musical to win the Pulitzer Prize for drama since 1918, will end its run on Jan. 16, after 21 preview performances and 733 regular performances at the Booth Theater, the show's lead producer, David Stone, said on Wednesday. The show is closing after a slow but modest weekly decline in its grosses in 2010. Mr. Stone said the producers had wanted to ''get close to having a two-year run.'' The musical opened at the Booth on April 15, 2009. The Pulitzer board, critics and many theatergoers have praised ''Next to Normal'' as a groundbreaking production for its story of a family coping with bipolar disorder, drug addiction, attempted suicide and a tragic death. Those factors made it an unlikely natural draw for commercial Broadway or for musical treatment by the composer Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, who wrote the book and lyrics. Even so, the show recouped its $4 million capitalization this year, putting it among the 25 percent to 30 percent of Broadway shows that do so annually. A tour of the show will begin Nov. 23 in Los Angeles, led by its original star, Alice Ripley, who won the 2009 Tony Award for best actress in a musical as the troubled mother, Diana Goodman. ''Next to Normal'' received 11 Tony nominations, including best musical, and won for best original score and best orchestrations, in addition to Ms. Ripley's honor. Directed by Michael Greif, the Broadway production was recast over the summer with a real-life couple, Marin Mazzie and Jason Danieley, taking the roles of Diana and her husband, Dan; they will continue through Jan. 16."

The Tony nominee Tom Wopat (''Annie Get Your Gun'') will play the deceiving father of Mr. Tveit's character, and the Tony nominee Kerry Butler (''Xanadu'') will portray the Tveit character's love interest. Also in the cast are Linda Hart and Nick Wyman as the parents of Ms. Butler's character and Rachel De Benedet as the mother of Mr. Tveit's. The seven actors originated their roles in a 2009 tryout in Seattle for ''Catch Me if You Can.'' Since that Seattle run, above, which drew encouraging but pointed critiques from the theatrical press, Brian Yorkey -- who shared a Tony and the Pulitzer Prize in drama for ''Next to Normal,'' for which he wrote the book and lyrics -- contributed substantial work on the book by the playwright Terrence McNally. Mr. Yorkey was not credited in the producers' statement. With music by Marc Shaiman and lyrics by Scott Wittman and Mr. Shaiman (who performed the same duties on ''Hairspray''), ''Catch Me if You Can'' is scheduled to begin previews on March 7 at the Neil Simon Theater and to open on April 10. Jack O'Brien is the director, and Jerry Mitchell is the choreographer."

These letters present a remarkable documentary portrait of a nation at a crossroads."

2010-11-12T00:00:00Z,"The much-anticipated Broadway production of ''The Mountaintop,'' Katori Hall's acclaimed play about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the eve of his assassination, is now looking likely for fall 2011, with Samuel L. Jackson (''Pulp Fiction'') and Halle Berry (''Monster's Ball'') poised to star, according to two executives involved in the production. There had been much talk about the play coming in this fall or spring to compete in the 2011 Tony Awards but that was always iffy, the executives said, given the busy schedules of the two stars. The executives insisted on remaining anonymous because private negotiations are continuing. One lead producer, Jean Doumanian, declined to comment on Thursday in advance of the producers' eventual announcement with details about the show. The drama was produced in London in 2009, drawing critical praise and emerging as a somewhat unexpected winner of the 2010 Olivier Award for best new play. Set in Room 306 of the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis, the play revolves around King (Mr. Jackson) and a hotel maid (Ms. Berry) who proves to have oratorical skills of her own. The production would mark the Broadway debut of Ms. Berry; Mr. Jackson is listed in a Broadway production database as having been an understudy in 1990 for August Wilson's ''The Piano Lesson'' as the lead character Boy Willie, a role he originated at Yale Repertory Theater."

Neither of Broadway's current blockbuster entertainments, the musicals ''Wicked'' and ''The Lion King,'' has media partnerships like this one.

Joseph Colaneri, an assistant conductor at the house, stepped in and led the final act. The Met said on Thursday that Mr. Levine, 67, was ''much better'' and planned to conduct the opera on Saturday, as scheduled. Mr. Levine has suffered a series of health problems in past years, most recently back trouble that resulted in spinal surgery in April. The problems have forced him to cancel many performances at the Met and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, where he is also music director. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Created by the screenwriter Jason Horwitch, ''Rubicon'' starred James Badge Dale (of HBO's ''The Pacific'') as an intelligence analyst who discovers what he believes is an ominous pattern in seemingly unrelated data. A sneak preview of its pilot episode was shown twice over the summer with the season finale of ''Breaking Bad'' and the season premiere of ''Mad Men,'' two other AMC mainstays, before it made its official debut on Aug. 1. Reviewing ''Rubicon'' for The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley wrote: ''It's easy to fall under the spell of the murky, paranoid world of 'Rubicon.' It's harder to tell from this preview whether the atmospherics add up to a solid and complex mystery.''"

The marriage of these two fairs has allowed both to ride out a difficult economy. It has also nudged painting and sculpture into close contact with furnishings, jewelry and decorative objects, producing a kind of friction that rarely occurs in museums. Because Modernism is the more established of the two fairs (with 25 years under its belt, to 9 for Art20), the design tends to dominate. This is generally not the place to go shopping for big-ticket 20th-century art, although the also-rans have plenty of personality."

The people behind ''Play Dead'' apparently know this, because they make every effort to send you home with a fellow audience member's entrails stuck in your hair or lodged in your tote bag. This gleefully grotesque orgy of death and fright, which leaves the Players Theater looking like a movie house after a midnight showing of ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show,'' is the creation of the magician Teller, who directs, and Todd Robbins, the main performer, whose areas of expertise include sword swallowing, séances and sideshow freaks. If you find that Halloween haunted houses just don't do it for you anymore, this just might be the show for you: scarier and smarter."

(Sundance) NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT PERSIAN CATS (2009) Negar (Negar Shaghaghi) and Ashkan (Ashkan Koshanejad) are young musicians with dreams of touring Europe and a need for backup players for their indie rock band -- in Tehran. ''Of course circumstances for iconoclastic, bohemian young people in Iran are not what they are elsewhere,'' A. O. Scott wrote in his review in The New York Times, adding that ''both the pathos and the buoyant energy'' of this ''bouncy, seething'' film by Bahman Ghobadi ''come from the sense that Negar, Ashkan and their friends are bravely laying claim to creativity, idealism and free expression in defiance of an authoritarian state that seeks to deny them those universal birthrights of modern youth.'' The film, above, which won a jury award in Cannes, is one of several movies that prompted the Iranian government to announce that it would punish filmmakers who do not obtain approval for their work. ''Productions in Iran are subject to review before being released there,'' The Times reported in December 2009, ''and directors are expected to submit screenplays for approval before beginning shooting, though some ignore the process.'' 8 P.M.

Gina Lollobrigida blinked lashes as thick as flora and smiled, and there it was, that smile, the one that snared Yul Brynner's Solomon in ''Solomon and Sheba'' 50 years ago, and she said, fooling absolutely no one, ''What is surprising is I'm still popular. They still know me.'' Ms. Lollobrigida is now 83, as vital and vibrant and hot-blooded as she was in her many roles as the voluptuous queen/gypsy/trapeze artist/opera singer/who cares, when she was routinely referred to by the aforementioned superlative, and even starred in a film by that name (retitled ''Beautiful but Dangerous'' for its American release, for some reason). She lives in Italy, but was passing through New York these last two weeks for a bunch of reasons, explained over the course of a couple of chats."

2010-11-14T00:00:00Z,"WOODFIN--Gene Mack, died Friday, the 12th of November 2010, in Houston, Texas. Gene was born February 7, 1919 in Paris, Texas to Alma Kathryn Smiley and John Elmer Woodfin. After attending public schools in Paris, Texas, Gene earned his LLB from the University of Texas School of Law, graduating with highest honors in 1940. Immediately after graduation, he joined the law firm of Vinson, Elkins, Weems and Francis (now Vinson & Elkins) in Houston, Texas, becoming a partner in 1948. During his tenure at Vinson & Elkins, Gene was instrumental in obtaining the rights of way for many transcontinental gas pipelines, including those for Columbia Gas, Pacific Gas and Trunkline Gas Companies. During this time he also worked with the Federal Power Commission in Washington, D.C. As many of his generation did after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Gene joined the armed forces in 1942. He entered the US Navy as an ensign and served at sea on fleet mine sweepers in the Atlantic, Pacific, Mediterranean and South China Sea, and was awarded five battle stars. He was detached from the Navy at Sasebo, Japan in December of 1946 as a Senior Lieutenant. In 1959 Gene became a senior partner in Loeb, Rhoades & Co., a New York investment banking firm. While living in New York, he discovered his beloved Quaker Hill in Pawling, New York where he maintained a home since 1965. Gene left Wall Street in 1973 to return to Houston as the President and CEO of Marathon Manufacturing Company, a global offshore drilling rig producer. He became Chairman of Marathon in 1974. The company was acquired by Penn Central Corporation in 1980, and Gene was a director until 1982. He served on many boards as a director, including the Houston Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas as Chairman from 1979-1980, and the University of Texas Foundation, Inc. as President. He also served on the boards of Apco Oil Corporation, Susquehanna Corporation, Jim Walter Corporation, Big Three Industries, Salisbury School, Studebaker-Worthington, Inc., The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and the Playboy Club. Gene loved his family and friends and thoroughly enjoyed entertaining. He was an avid sportsman, golfer and hunter, and especially loved fishing and hunting at Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier, Pennsylvania and Clove Valley Rod and Gun Club in LaGrangeville, New York. He was an unswerving and loyal friend and generous with his time and resources to anyone in need. He was the quintessential Texan: fiercely independent and passionate in his devotion to his family, friends, career and community. Gene's Texas roots were deep, with the Smiley-Woodfin prairie grassland in Lamar County being recognized as the largest section of native grassland in Texas by the Texas Historical Commission. His past and present club affiliations include Houston Country Club, Quaker Hill Country Club, Eldorado Country Club, Castle Pines Golf Club, Garden of the Gods Club, Links Club, Doubles Club, Coronado Club, The Argyle, Harry's Bar, and Mark's Club. Gene is survived by his wife of 32 years, Jerry Ann McFaddin Woodfin of Houston, Texas; his son Dr. William S. Woodfin and wife Fran of McKinney, Texas; Robert Eldon Young III and wife Jennifer Young of Austin, Texas; Jerry McFaddin Young and Kim Herbsleb of Houston, Texas; his six grandchildren, William Keith Woodfin, Gene Sam Woodfin, Victoria Young, Grace Young, Katharine Young, and Caroline Young; former daughter-in-law Jennifer Stokes Young; nieces Hester Parker and husband Richard of Dallas, Texas and Georgia Leddy and husband Mike of Paris, Texas; nephew John Mack Woodfin and wife Dora of Paris, Texas; numerous grandnieces and his beloved Jack Russell, Wags.

The family expresses its gracious thanks to Ken Hall, Alicia Aguirre, Esther Castillo, Hannah Barrett, Linwood Boone, Dennis Brunow, and to Dr. James Willerson and Mae Thomas at St. Luke's Hospital and their staff for their tender loving care. A memorial service will be held at 3:00pm Monday, November 15, 2010 at St. John the Divine Episcopal Church, 2450 River Oaks Boulevard, Houston, Texas.

Its amalgam of children, parents, toys, a Christmas tree, snow, sweets and Tchaikovsky's astounding score is integral to the season of good will that runs from Thanksgiving to New Year. Nowhere else in the world is this ballet so beloved as in the United States. The troupes of Russia -- where it originated -- have not maintained the long traditions of performing it that they treasure with, say, ''Giselle'' and ''Swan Lake.'' Covent Garden was a ''Nutcracker''-free zone for more than 20 years. European companies have come around and perform it annually now, but years after American companies pointed the way.

2010-11-14T00:00:00Z,"TIMOTHY EGAN If common sense were currency Michele Bachmann would be broke, and holding a tin can by the road-side just now. Alas, because we live in an age where hyperbole is gold, Bachmann is rich. She was on CNN the other day,a rare departure from the in-house fawning of Fox ''News,'' expressing out-rage that President Obama's trip to India was going to cost $200 million a day and involve nearly three dozen war-ships. In fact, this figure was made up. Now that they have to govern, Republicans are grappling with a tough initial challenge: how to detach themselves from an influential wing of their party that has never been interested in arguing facts. On a daily basis, these people bemoan, detest and feign outrage over utter fantasies. Some of the loudest voices are elected representatives; others are professional provocateurs i-terested in keeping their lecture feeshigh and their base in a lather.Bachmann's disastrous turn outside the Fox bubble was instructive, for its howed how the liars' club works.-- Excerpt from ''Liars' Club'' FIXES The typical institutional response to bullying is to get tough. In the case of the suicide of Tyler Clementi, a gay college student who was a victim of cyber-bullying, prosecutors are considering bringing hate-crime charges. But some programs show the potential of augmenting our innate impulses to care for one another instead of just fall-ing back on punishment as a deterrent. And what's the secret formula? A baby. We know that humans are hardwired to be aggressive and selfish. But a growing body of research is demonstrating that there is also a biological basis for human compassion. Brain scans reveal that when we contemplate violence done to others we activate the same regions in our brains that fire up when mothers gaze at their children, suggesting that caring for strangers may be instinctual. We are beginning to understand how to nurture this biolog-ical potential. It seems that it's not only possible to make people kinder, it'spossible to do it systematically -- at least with schoolchildren.-- DAVID BORNSTEIN, excerpt from''Fighting Bullying With Babies''For more, nytimes.com/opinionator"

Then, despite good-natured banter between the drivers, an unspoken challenge is made. Finally, a tire-smoking showdown ensues. One big difference this time: the encounter, which took place at summer's end, did not begin on the main drag of a small Midwestern town and pursue resolution on a deserted country road. Instead, the Camaros, a pair of pumped-up early '70s models owned by friends, faced off at the Azadi Stadium Race Track in Tehran."

One of the most indelible ads in fashion history, the image was part of a niche campaign that included a Peggy Olsen-worthy tagline - ''Are you made for Fire & Ice?'' - and a bizarre questionnaire that asked, 'Have you ever wanted to wear an ankle bracelet?' and 'Does gypsy music make you sad?' While a lot has changed since 1952, Fire & Ice has a new shelf life now that Revlon has re-released three ''lip-and-tip'' pairings ($4.79 - $ 8.99).

2010-11-14T00:00:00Z,"A few years ago, when the San Francisco company Aliph released the Jawbone - a pretty little nugget of a Bluetooth headset that offers superior ''noise assassin'' technology - I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. It was certainly an attractive piece of design. Early models sported a super-techy grill designed by the company's chief creative officer, Yves Behar, and later models included one that was just the shade of red to match my hair. But I could never get past the fact that I didn't really mind talking on a phone, no matter how many bells and whistles the Jawbone could offer. Next week, Aliph will release its next product: a wireless speaker called the Jambox, which connects to any Bluetooth-enabled device (like a laptop, smartphone or iPad, which is being packaged as its ultimate match in Apple stores worldwide). Like the Jawbone, it offers quality and craftsmanship in the smallest possible package - think of it like a Victor JVC boombox that has been reduced to the size of a butter dish. But unlike its predecessor, the Jambox ought to have broader appeal - it certainly does for me. Like most people these days, I'd been listening to music through iTunes. But I'd been listening to iTunes through a complex system of demode devices: in the living room, a pair of wired Logitech speakers; in the bedroom, a five-CD stereo system's auxiliary input; and in the kitchen, a retro-looking Tivoli radio. Woe was me if I ever wanted to listen to music in the shower."

2010-11-14T00:00:00Z,"DEANE--Disque D.,died on November 8, 2010 in Boston, Massachusetts. He was one of the most innovative and creative financiers on Wall Street. One of Disque Deane's more prestigious accomplishments was his revolutionary approach to sale-leaseback transactions. He was a senior partner of Lazard Freres & Co. from 1963 1978. In 1972, Mr. Deane and Andre Meyer restructured and financed Starrett City, a 5,881 unit model community in Brooklyn, New York. The community was restructured so that investors could benefit from a partnership that combined equity investments from private banks, state agencies and loans from federal housing authorities. The Community, opened in January, 1974, has its own shopping center, newspaper, power plant and security force. It is the largest and most successful affordable housing community in the United States. Disque Deane was the Chairman of the Deane Group and founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Corporate Property Investors, the largest private REIT prior to its acquisition by Simon Property Group in 1998. He believed in education and medical research. Mr. Deane supported primary and secondary schools as well as universities. He established the Deane Laboratories in Neurobiology at Duke University. Disque Deane was the Chairman of the Deane Institute for Integrated Research on Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke at Massachusetts General Hospital as well as a Trustee at the Linus Pauling Institute, Rockefeller University and Duke University. Mr. Deane was a graduate of Stuyvesant High School and attended Duke University. He graduated from the U.S.M.S. United States Navy Officer Training School. He is survived by his wife, Carol and their two children, Anne and Carl, and his children by his deceased wife, Marjorie Schlesinger Deane: Marjorie Swain, Kathryn Deane, Disque Deane, Jr. and Walter Deane. He has seven grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. A service will be held at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church at 11:00am on Friday, November 19.

Bartlett says she chose the eclectic interior, which brings to mind onesie-clad musclemen doing chin-ups, in order ''to evoke a vintage gymnasium, since the VPL aesthetic was originally based on vintage undergarments.'' Besides, she adds with a nudge, ''I'm inspired by a life well-lived - I'm not stuck on minimalism.'' Created with the Brooklyn-based architecture firm Studio a+i, the shop carries the main VPL line of comfy basics and the more sports-inspired VPL Too, as well as various accessory and jewelry collaborations. As part of the designer's commitment to showcase the work of artist friends, a large photo collage (of the first VPL collection) by Mark Borthwick hangs behind the register. 5 Mercer Street; (212) 966-2145; vplnyc.com."

A.First, be sure to make hotel reservations as soon as possible, as December is a busy time in New York. If price is not a concern, Michelle Higgins, The Times's Practical Traveler columnist, echoed your preference for the Plaza Hotel (Fifth Avenue at Central Park South; theplaza.com), the New York landmark that recently went through a partial conversion to condo units but still offers almost 300 hotel rooms. She also recommended the Pierre (2 East 61 Street; tajhotels.com/pierre), the flagship of the luxurious Taj Hotels chain, that is just around the corner from the Plaza, overlooking Central Park; it reopened in June 2009 after a $100 million renovation. And if your hotel style leans more toward the modern, Ms. Higgins recommended the London NYC (151 West 54 Street; thelondonnyc.com), ''which is a bit more sleek yet also in a good spot for shopping, with Fifth Avenue shops in one direction and the shops at Columbus Circle in the other.''"

The two recently made their inaugural trip to Japan, traveling to Kyoto to take in tea ceremonies, ancient temples and Noh theater.

Born Antoinette Merker on March 2, 1926 to Albert and Helene Merker, and known as Anita, Anita spent her childhood in Paris, France. In 1941, Anita's family fled the German invasion, eventually reaching New York City where she graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology and met her husband of over fifty years, the late Louis D. Liskin. Anita taught French at the Dwight-Englewood School in Englewood, NJ for over ten years where her charm, enthusiasm and patience inspired many a previously reluctant student to embrace the French language. Anita also took great pleasure in using her knowledge of fashion and design to costume a number of the school's theatrical productions. Anita's bonds with her students and fellow teachers continued well after she retired from teaching. Immensely generous and warm-hearted, full of intellectual curiosity and joie de vivre and always possessed of that quintessentially French sense of style, Anita was loved by everyone who knew her well.

In 2005, he passed for 1,333 yards, 11 touchdowns and 3 interceptions while Terrell Owens criticized everything but his goatee.

2010-11-15T00:00:00Z,"An article in the Your Money special section on Nov. 5, about longevity insurance, a product that allows people to insure against outliving their retirement assets, described imprecisely the benefits of a state guarantee association should an insurance company fail. The association would provide coverage based on the value of the insured's projected annuity benefits; it would not be based on the amount paid for the insurance and thus would not necessarily ''pay back the amount you invested.''"
2010-11-15T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (Sundance) JAR CITY (2006) In this moody thriller from Baltasar Kormakur, a weary homicide detective named Erlendur (Ingvar E. Sigurdsson) investigates the murder of an old man and opens up a hornet's nest of long-ago crimes and buried secrets. ''The picture of Iceland that emerges'' in the film ''is vivid and powerful but not something the country's tourist board would be likely to endorse,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''The landscape has its austere poetry to be sure -- mountains framing the apartment blocks of Reykjavik, spits of volcanic rock jutting into a churning sea -- but a fog of damp unhappiness seems to pervade every face and conversation. And yet by the end of this film, based on a popular mystery novel by Arnaldur Indridason, it is hard not to feel a certain affection for the place.'' Mr. Scott described the movie as ''intricate and pointed, conjuring a haunting, satisfying puzzle out of violence and chaos.'' In Icelandic, with English subtitles. 8 P.M.

An elder statesman of the tech industry, he prefers to remain out of the limelight. Yet his influence behind the scenes has been enormous. He served as chief executive of Intuit; the Go Corporation, a pioneering, but ultimately failed, maker of pen computing technology; and Claris, the software maker that Apple spun off in 1987. He currently serves as chairman of Intuit and a board member of Apple. He has been a close adviser and confidant to some of the Valley's best-known figures, including Steve Jobs, Eric Schmidt and John Doerr. And he has been a mentor to scores of young entrepreneurs and executives, a role that has earned Mr. Campbell, a former football coach at Columbia University, the moniker of ''coach.'' Mr. Campbell said he does all this simply as way of ''giving back'' to colleagues and to an industry that has been good to him."

SuperLab will be held once a month; among the works already selected are ''Annie Bosh is Missing'' by Janine Nabers, ''The Many Mistresses of Martin Luther King'' by Andrew Dolan and ''3C'' by David Adjmi (''Stunning'').Each playwright is given 29 hours over a week and decides how to allot that time, with a director and actors recruited for readings and scene work. The writers also work with Clubbed Thumb's producing artistic director, Maria Striar, and Playwrights' director of new play development, Adam Greenfield, to identify what to work on in their script revisions, and the two artistic leaders provide feedback before, during, and after the labs."

2010-11-16T00:00:00Z,"MITCHELL--Pamela Battey. Died on Cape Cod November 10, 2010. Born June 3, 1934 to Dorothy and Edward Battey, she spent her childhood in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, a town she always loved. She was a graduate of Oak Grove School in Vassalboro, Maine, attended Skidmore and Bennington Colleges, and graduated from Colorado College with a Bachelor of Arts, focusing on sculpture and dance. She spent two summers at Colorado College dancing under the direction of choreographer and modern dance educator Hanya Holm. She moved to Washington, DC in 1958 and worked on Capitol Hill for the late Senator Thomas Dodd of Connecticut. While working in DC she met Dr. Jere H. Mitchell, a physician scientist working at the National Institutes of Health. They married on October 1, 1960 and later moved to Dallas where they raised their three daughters and enjoyed a life filled with family, friends, travel and good heath. They developed a particular attachment for Copenhagen, Denmark, a place where they spent many summers. For the past twenty years, they spent part of each year on Cape Cod at their summer home, which Pam treasured. Throughout her life, Pam had an unusual sensibility and understanding of nature and an intense appreciation for the landscape and wildlife of Texas and her beloved Cape Cod. She was a committed environmentalist and a strong believer in preserving open space and habitats, particularly wetlands, for native plants and animals to thrive. Pam was known for having an eye for beautiful, artful objects. She had an extensive knowledge of art and antiquities from cultures all over the world. Her broad interest in art contributed to her imaginative, keen sense of style and her ability to bring together disparate objects in aesthetically pleasing and surprising ways. She enjoyed no place more than an ethnographic museum with a terrific collection. Those who knew Pam admired her athleticism, her strength, and her amazing skill as a downhill skier, an activity she enjoyed until very recently. Her strength was apparent as she endured the hardships of cancer; she was uncomplaining and strong throughout her illness, something her family and friends found remarkable and inspiring. Pamela is survived by Dr. Jere H. Mitchell, her husband of 50 years, and her three loving daughters: Wendy O'Sullivan (and her husband Jon) of Dallas, TX, Dr. Laurie Mitchell (and her husband Brent Woods) of San Diego, CA, and Amy Poeppel (and her husband David) of New York, NY. She will be greatly missed by her eight grandchildren, Mathew O'Sullivan, Megan O'Sullivan, Madeline Woods, Sophie Woods, Calvin Woods, Alex Poeppel, Andrew Poeppel and Luke Poeppel. She will also be remembered by many dear friends around the world. The family requests, in lieu of flowers, that donations be made in her name to Planned Parenthood, World Wildlife Fund, or VNA Hospice of Cape Cod."

2010-11-17T00:01:09Z,"Recently, researchers in Finland made the discovery that some people’s bodies do not respond as expected to weight training, others don’t respond to endurance exercise and, in some lamentable cases, some don’t respond to either. In other words, there are those who just do not become fitter or stronger, no matter what exercise they undertake. To reach this conclusion, the researchers enrolled 175 sedentary adults in a 21-week exercise program. Some lifted weights twice a week. Others jogged or walked. Some did both. Before and after the program, the volunteers’ fitness and muscular strength were assessed. At the end of the 21 weeks, the results, published earlier this year in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, were mixed. In the combined strength-and-endurance-exercise program, the volunteers’ physiological improvement ranged from a negative 8 percent (meaning they became 8 percent less fit) to a positive 42 percent. The results were similar in the groups that undertook only strength or only endurance training. Some improved their strength enormously, some not at all. Others became aerobically fitter but not stronger, while still others showed no improvements in either area. Only a fortunate few became both fitter and more buff. As the researchers from the University of Jyvaskyla wrote with some understatement, “large individual differences” exist “in the responses to both endurance and strength training.”"

During her active and vibrant life she was known for her profound care and help of others. She devoted her life to helping children and adults with physical and intellectual disabilities to achieve their maximum potential and pleasure to enable them to lead full and productive lives. Her boundless energy was evident when involved in countless philanthropic endeavors as a leader, organizer and benefactor. Among her many accomplishments she was especially proud of creating The Big E for Epilepsy and founding a free clinic at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital for individuals with epilepsy. To raise money for the clinic she organized and led tours around the world. As a pioneer in promoting the independence of people with intellectual disabilities she helped create New Hope Community in Loch Sheldrake, NY - motivated by her son Tad, who was the light of her life. She was recently honored at the community by the naming of a facility she helped sponsor and fund called ""Maxie's Place."" She was an esteemed member of the St. John's University family and was an enthusiastic fan of the soccer team. The family funded the Belson soccer stadium on campus and the Maxine & Jerome Belson Moot Court at the university's law school. She was honored for her work with disabled children by St. John's University with their Medal of Honor and awarded a Doctorate of Pedeology by Niagara University. Her family was a great source of joy throughout her life. She was the adored wife of Jerome, her husband for 56 years. She was the devoted and loving mother of her son Tad; daughter Brianne and son-in-law Sanford; her predeceased son Michael and daughter-in-law Kathy; and daughter-in-law Marjorie. She was a beloved grandmother of Matthew and his wife Jodi; Joshua and his wife Katy; Jaclyn, Toby and Jonathan. She was also great grandmother to Noah, Ariel and Paisley. Her love for her family was only matched by the love for her. She will be missed by the multitude of friends and family who were the beneficiaries of her care, love and sense of humor.

Jack had been one of the cornerstones of the institution for a quarter century. In 1984, he became involved with the Westchester Community College Foundation, ultimately serving as its chairperson for eight years. In this role, he assisted the Foundation in its efforts to raise funds for college projects, faculty support, and student scholarships. In addition to contributing personally to all three, he was instrumental in helping set the fundraising bar high in order to assist students. Largely due to his efforts, the Foundation now annually contributes more than $1 Million in student scholarships. In 2008, Jack was named an Emeritus member of the Foundation board. In addition to scholarships, this nationally-known patron of the arts supported the college's efforts to showcase a wide variety of cultural events including the Jack and Ralynn Stadler Distinguished Chair Lecture Series. This event was established through his generosity and was named after Jack and his late wife Ralynn. Ralynn predated Jack on the college's Board of Trustees. He was appointed to finish her term on the board in 1990 and since that time, had been part of the leadership group that directed college efforts, shepherding in an expansion of programs, facilities, and resources resulting in the dramatic growth of the student body.

Mr. Kheel's longstanding connection with CUNY grew out of his ambition to change the way New Yorkers saw their relationship with the city's environment. In 2004 he approached the University with an idea and the funding to develop a course, ""The Nature of New York: Its Natural History and Environment,"" which was first offered through the School of Professional Studies and is now integrated into the CUNY Online Baccalaureate program as a science proficiency course. The CUNY Institute for Sustainable Cities, now based at Hunter College, was also created out of the vision and financial support of Mr. Kheel, who was awarded the Chancellor's Medal in 2005 for his environmental education work. Mr. Kheel's avid commitment and support will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his family. Benno Schmidt, Chair, Board of Trustees Matthew Goldstein, Chancellor"

I'd long figured that the choice is a matter of taste and price. I usually use canola oil because it's neutral in flavor, a good source of omega-3s and inexpensive. Like soy oil, it costs about a dime a tablespoon, whereas extra-virgin olive oils can run well over a dollar. Partisans of the olive maintain that a high-quality extra-virgin oil brings its special flavor and health benefits to foods cooked in it. More recipes now suggest it for frying and other high-heat techniques, not just for last-minute drizzling. But does it make enough difference that it's worth a tenfold premium in price?"

2010-11-17T00:00:00Z,"CHIARA--Judith Helen Loeb. With great sorrow, her family announces the death of Judith Helen Loeb (Beaty) Chiara, born 1927, in New York City. Judy never awoke from a night's sleep and passed away peacefully on November 14th at Lenox Hill Hospital, attended by many family and friends. Judy as everyone knew her, was the daughter of John and Frances Loeb, both scions of illustrious New York Families. Judy was their oldest child and is survived by her four brothers and sisters, including the Honorable John Loeb Jr., former US Ambassador to Denmark, Ann Loeb Bronfman, Arthur Lehman Loeb, the former owner of the Madison Avenue Bookshop, and Deborah Brice of London, England. She was a loving mother and grandmother to her six children, two step-children and fourteen grandchildren. A first great-grandchild is on the way. Judy was first married to Richard N. Beat, an American fighter pilot who fought in WWII with the Royal Air Force and died in 1965. She subsequently married and was divorced from Marco Chiara, the son of the Italian novelist Piero Chiara. Judy graduated from the Madeira School and attended Vassar College before graduating from Barnard. Both Vassar and Madeira remained important to Judy and she became close to Madeira's headmistress, Betsey Griffiths, who had important changes to the curriculum. Last year, Vassar's oldest building was modernized and dedicated to Judy, due to her and her family interest and contributions to the College's expanding social programs. The Judith L. Chiara scholarship is given in her honor to one Vassar student each year. Judy was an active philanthropist who was involved in many New York institutions and charities. She was the Chairman of the Board of Exponents/Arrive, the first New York City counseling program to assist AIDS patients; she was on the Board of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a human rights watchdog organization; and had become a major supporter of Teamwork Foundation, a long term highly successful after-school program for athletes in the Bronx (the New York Gauchos basketball team). She was a contributor and Board member as well of the Harlem Symphony, a founder of The Catalogue for Giving and many other similar groups and organizations all of which will miss her spirit and support. Judy always lived a very full life and leaves behind friends from Maine to the Bahamas, from Venice Beach, California to Venice, Italy and too many other places to mention. She was an avid sailor and the skipper of her own racing yawl, the Susanna, and proud of her race successes. But she was proudest of her family and friends. Her life affected many people, none more so than her children: Nancy, Susan, Richard, Frances, Anne, John, Charlie, and Daniela. We all miss her and will always miss her. A private burial is planned for Sunday, November 21, at Kenisco Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. In lieu of flowers, please consider a gift in her name to the charity of your choice.

Bruce Hall, who has very limited sight, uses his camera underwater, above, so that he can see what he was looking at when he returns to dry land. This documentary from Neil Leifer explores how photography provides a creative opportunity for three artists for whom sight is mostly in the mind.

According to The Journal, the professor, Wafaa Bilal, has offered to cover the camera with a lens cap when he is on the N.Y.U. campus, out of respect for students' privacy, but the university may require him to turn the camera off. In a statement on Tuesday the university said it was in discussions with Mr. Bilal about to how to ensure that his camera would not take pictures in N.Y.U. buildings.

Dobbie Bassett, died Thursday night at her home in Upperville, VA. after a long illness. Ms. Bassett was born in Miami, Oklahoma to George and Elizabeth Coleman in 1942. Her family moved to Pebble Beach, California a few years later because of her father's love of golf. Dobbie began riding horses as a very young child and was a consummate horsewoman from the start. She competed nationally from a young age, under the expert eye of the renowned horse trainer Richard (Dick) Collins. She won blue ribbons on her horse Fancy Free throughout her entire childhood. Her striving for perfection and her competitive spirit, later served her well when showing and winning with her beloved Cardigan Welsh Corgis. Her education included Santa Catalina School for Girls in Monterey, California and then onto Garrison Forrest in Maryland. She attended finishing school in Switzerland, where she learned to speak French fluently, and then went to Florence, Italy to study art history. Moving to New York City at age twenty, Dobbie studied interior design and fashion, and developed her innate sense of style and flair, which would be one of her trademarks throughout her life. Dobbie's passion was her animals- specifically horses and dogs. Through her young daughter, Carolines Corgi, Gwendolyn, she fell in love with the breed. She moved to Middleburg, Virginia in 1983 where she could live out her dream of fox hunting in the beautiful Virginia Piedmont, and continue breeding and showing Cardigans. She focused her creative energies in breeding championship lines of his wonderful breed and made an enormous contribution to the Corgi world. She had two marriages. She was married to Theodore S. Bassett and they had one daughter, Caroline. Her second marriage was to Pierre de Segur in Paris, France, a city very dear to her heart. She had many friends from all walks of life. Dobbie Coleman Bassett de Segur will be missed by all who knew her. She is survived by her only child Caroline E. Bassett who resides in New York City. In lieu of flowers donations would be most welcome to the Cardigan Welsh Corgi Association of America (CWCCA) c/o Ingrid Greca PO Box 0069 Willoughby, OH 44094 ""earmarked"" for the ""Veterans""."

2010-11-18T00:00:00Z,"CHIARA--Judith Helen Loeb. With great sorrow, her family announces the death of Judith Helen Loeb (Beaty) Chiara, born 1927, in New York City. Judy never awoke from a night's sleep and passed away peacefully on November 14th at Lenox Hill Hospital, attended by many family and friends. Judy, as everyone knew her, was the daughter of John and Frances Loeb, both scions of illustrious New York Families. Judy was their oldest child and is survived by her four brothers and sisters, including the Honorable John Loeb Jr., former US Ambassador to Denmark, Ann Loeb Bronfman, Arthur Lehman Loeb, the former owner of the Madison Avenue Bookshop, and Deborah Brice of London, England. She was a loving mother and grandmother to her six children, two step-children and fourteen grandchildren. A first great-grandchild is on the way. Judy was first married to Richard N. Beaty, an American fighter pilot who fought in WWII with the Royal Air Force and died in 1965. She subsequently married and was divorced from Marco Chiara, the son of the Italian novelist Piero Chiara. Judy graduated from the Madeira School and attended Vassar College before graduating from Barnard. Both Vassar and Madeira remained important to Judy and she became close to Madeira's headmistress, Betsey Griffiths, who made important changes to the curriculum. Last year, Vassar's oldest building was modernized and dedicated to Judy, due to her and her family interest and contributions to the College's expanding social programs. The Judith L. Chiara scholarship is given in her honor to one Vassar student each year. Judy was an active philanthropist who was involved in many New York institutions and charities. She was the Chairman of the Board of Exponents/Arrive, the first New York City counseling program to assist AIDS patients; she was on the Board of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a human rights watchdog organization; and had become a major supporter of Teamwork Foundation, a long term highly successful after-school program for athletes in the Bronx (the New York Gauchos basketball team). She was a contributor and Board member as well of the Harlem Symphony, a founder of The Catalogue for Giving and many other similar groups and organizations all of which will miss her spirit and support. Judy always lived a very full life and leaves behind friends from Maine to the Bahamas, from Venice Beach, California to Venice, Italy and too many other places to mention. She was an avid sailor and the skipper of her own racing yawl, the Susanna, and proud of her race successes. But she was proudest of her family and friends. Her life affected many people, none more so than her children: Nancy, Susan, Richard, Frances, Anne, John, Charlie, and Daniela. We all miss her and will always miss her. A private burial is planned for Sunday, November 21, at Kenisco Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. In lieu of flowers, please consider a gift in her name to the charity of your choice. A memorial service is planned for late January 2011. Exact date and venue to be announced."

Forget ''Running With Scissors,'' forget ''Iron Man''s 1 and 2, forget GOOP and forget that she named her first-born child Apple. To watch Gwyneth Paltrow on ''Glee'' Tuesday was like being transported back to the late 1990s, when she could do no wrong and to see her on a screen was a guarantee of a compelling performance (and maybe the possibility of seeing her decapitated head in a box). Whether she came onto ''Glee'' as a sweeps-week stunt, to again show off her pipes before the release of her film ''Country Strong'' or simply out of the kindness of her heart, Ms. Paltrow was perfectly suited to her role as Holly Holliday, a substitute teacher with a seriously reckless streak."
2010-11-18T00:00:00Z,"A return to boom-time dividends remains distant for bank investors in the United States. It's not just that the Federal Reserve is imposing strict criteria, including stress-testing their portfolios again, before financial firms can return more capital to shareholders next year. Dividends have also dwindled so badly that they already face a long slog back. Banks accounted for almost a third of all dividends paid by S.&.P. 500 companies in 2007. That has fallen to just 8.9 percent this year, according to Standard & Poor's. At $18.7 billion, the total expected to be disbursed by financial firms is only about a quarter of the payout three years ago. For the biggest banks the gap is even bigger."

2010-11-19T20:45:43Z,"On Tuesday I wrote about the LifeStraw Family, an in-home water purification device. The product itself is interesting, but what I wanted to highlight in the column is how its manufacturer, Vestergaard Frandsen, is planning to make money with it. Not from the poor families who use it - they will give it away in western Kenya. Instead, the company plans to be paid in credits they can sell on the global carbon markets. In this system, credits are awarded to projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They may then be then bought by polluting companies or governments to offset their own emissions. LifeStraw Family users no longer have to boil their water to make it safe to drink. Less boiling means fewer emissions."

In this show, Agee continues to give domesticity her own spin, in hand-painted and stenciled, large-scale ""wallpaper drawings"" that depict idealized interiors, and which allude to models as diverse as 19th century scenic wallpaper, Matisse's ""The Dessert: Harmony in Red,"" and the spaces depicted in Roy Lichtenstein's paintings. Along with a display of intricate white porcelain vases, the exhibition includes three works that are groups of hand-made porcelain platters and bowls arranged on a steel armature.

The Buckeyes will need to win out, starting Saturday at Iowa, and get some help from the Badgers, but the goal is still a realistic one. Virginia Tech -- which began the season with two losses, including an embarrassing defeat at the hands of James Madison -- has won eight in a row and has its sights set on the A.C.C. title. Miami would love to give the Hokies their first conference loss. Nebraska is kicking itself for the egg it laid against Texas. If not for that, the Cornhuskers would be in the middle of the race for the national title. As it is, they will travel to College Station on Saturday to take on Texas A&M, which has won four in a row. Neither Arkansas nor Mississippi State is going to win the SEC, but both teams have enjoyed successful seasons. A win over the Razorbacks would get the Bulldogs to eight victories in their second year under Coach Dan Mullen. And, finally, there is Southern California, all but forgotten in the wake of the N.C.A.A. sanctions that followed the Reggie Bush mess. But Lane Kiffin has had the Trojans playing well of late.

2010-11-19T15:34:31Z,"At the government's request, the tribes that populate the remote Indonesian island of Sumba stopped hunting heads in the 1950s. Or at least that was what was supposed to happen. In reality, a head was lopped off in an intratribal war as recently as last March. ''We had to stop sending people on trips to the waterfall for months until things settled down,'' says Claude Graves, one of three Westerners living permanently on the island. Graves and his wife have spent the last 20 years building Nihiwatu, the most exclusive and lavish surf destination in the world. The hideaway resort draws ultrarich, über-athletic adventurers, who come to test themselves against a legendary wave and to be surrounded by one of the last Stone Age cultures on Earth."

Not only was Godard's 1967 film ""La Chinoise"" the inspiration for Sternberg's fall 2009 collection, but his fashion label's own name, Band of Outsiders, comes from the English title of Godard's canonical 1964 film ""Bande à Part.""

2010-11-19T00:00:00Z,"The statue of Mars and Venus that greets visitors to the official residence of Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, is a striking example of classical Roman sculpture but to certain observers it seemed incomplete. Dating back to 175 A.D., the representation of Venus was missing one of her hands, and her companion, Mars, was missing the very feature that some might say made him such a manly god of war. But the work at Palazzo Chigi in Rome has been restored to anatomical completeness, The Guardian reported: Venus now has all of her digits and Mars was given a new penis. The Italian newspaper La Repubblica said Mr. Berlusconi had requested the restoration of the statue, but Mario Catalano, the prime minister's architect, told The Guardian, ''I took the decision.'' Mr. Catalano added that the replacement parts were attached using a magnetic system and were removable but declined to provide additional details. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

The last time there was a surge in bank fraud prosecutions was in the early 1990s during the savings and loan crisis that led to the collapse of nearly 1,800 financial institutions. Unlike that era, the number of bank failures has totaled 311 since 2008, and most of those were smaller institutions that got caught up in construction lending."

The stage version of ''The 39 Steps,'' which enlists four dynamic, unfortunate, overworked actors to play the dozens of characters seen in the film, has been running at New World Stages since March 25, and will have played 23 previews and 318 performances there when it closes. Fittingly, the quick-change show arrived at New World after a frantic Broadway run that saw it move from the American Airlines Theater (where it opened in January 2008) to the Cort Theater to the Helen Hayes Theater, in a span of just over a year.

The film ''owes an obvious debt to'' Bruce Beresford's 1983 drama ''Tender Mercies,'' Mr. Scott added, ''but there can never be too many songs about drinking, loving and feeling bad, and there is always room for another version of that old song about the guy who messed it all up and kept on going.

2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"Lean, tattooed and hunky in the way of a young Henry Rollins, Brian Reaume is living the life of a gay indie Brooklyn or Bay Area artist. He lives in what real estate agents call a ''transitional'' neighborhood, in a house filled with midcentury furniture and quirky art by him and his friends. In a small shop on a funky strip of cafes, bars and galleries, he sells his paintings along with the vintage housewares that he collects with the shop's co-owner, Nancy Carlson, who lives upstairs. Two years ago he created ''There's No Truth in Silence,'' an installation in his studio -- which is among a warren of artists' spaces in an old warehouse -- that drew thousands one weekend with its controversial use of the American flag, a swastika, a cross and a chair emblazoned with the word ''fag.'' But the life that Reaume leads isn't in Brooklyn or San Francisco. His tatty-cool neighborhood isn't Bushwick or the Tenderloin; it's Kenmore Park in northeast Columbus, Ohio, in, as he put it to me on a recent visit, ''a very good pocket in the middle of the ghetto.'' And that funky strip with his shop, Birchwater Studios, is North High Street in Columbus's Short North, which has gone from sketchy to stylish in the past 15 years."

She was born January 30, 1944 in Louisville, KY to Margaret Rodman Murray and J. Greig Spalding. Murray was a dancer, choreographer, educator and presenter of dance for over 35 years. Mentored by the dance pioneer, Bessie Schonberg, she received her BA and MFA in Dance from Sarah Lawrence College. She founded Murray Spalding Dance Theater in 1974. Her repertory of over 40 works have been performed in the US and Mexico. Since 1997 she focused on creating a series of minimalist, ethereal Mandalas, ""movement mediations that occupy a place between prayer and performance,"" that she continued until the time of her death and that her company performed in numerous venues. Murray received numerous prestigious artistic grants during her career, from such notable organizations as the NEA, the DC Commission for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Andy Warhol Foundation, and in 2002 was awarded a New York Foundation for the Arts Artists' Fellowship. She is survived by her husband James F Bleakley, four step-children: Forrest, James, Brittin and Silas Bleakley, a sister Greig O'Dea as well as extended family, friends and dancers who will miss her inspiration.

2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"One recent, drizzly Sunday, I met the artist Vik Muniz at his Ipanema home to drive from Zona Sul, the beachy, bathing-suited Rio of Copacabana lore, to the less renowned poorer part of the city in the north. As we whizzed up Avenida Brasil through an area called Mare, Muniz indicated a cluster of favelas arrayed around a public pool called Piscinão de Ramos and quipped, ''You have to think of Rio as St. Tropez -- surrounded by Mogadishu.'' Muniz, who splits his time between New York and Rio, sited his studio in a grim northern barrio called Parada de Lucas, in order to be next to the city's largest junkyard. The proximity allows Muniz, who creates work from found objects, to prowl the premises with abandon. His studio recently appeared in ''Waste Land,'' a documentary that charted his collaboration with a group of poor catadores, or garbage recyclers, from nearby Jardim Gramacho, Rio's biggest landfill. After drawing classically styled portraits of catadores, Muniz recruited them to help recreate the original drawings with enormous collages composed of painstakingly arranged buckets, nuts, bolts, old refrigeration units, tractor pieces, chunks of plastic and so on, spread out all over the studio floor. Shot from high above, the junk collages became a series of photographs in 2008 that traveled around the country and drew half a million visitors. The photographs were sold at auction and collected by museums around the world. The garbage pickers got to watch their bodies become art, then junk, then art, then money."

2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"''Western paper turns away the light, while our paper seems to take it in, to envelop it gently, like the soft surface of a first snowfall,'' wrote the Japanese author Jun'ichiro Tanizaki in ''In Praise of Shadows,'' his 1933 manifesto on the aesthetic differences between the East and West. His observations on subtlety, the play of light and dark, and, for that matter, all things Japanese, have lately been on the minds of Alexa Adams and Flora Gill, the design duo behind the label Ohne Titel. ''While I was reading his work, I felt like I was experiencing this slice of traditional Japanese aesthetics visually,'' Adams says. Adds Gill, ''It's almost a goal toward perfect design, which as designers we're always searching for.'' In their spring 2011 collection, the pair softened their usual aggressive silhouettes with nods to the Orient: striped ribbed knitwear inspired by the Japanese woodblock print artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi, linen tie-front pants, jackets with kimono-style volume in the sleeves. The two recently made their inaugural trip to Japan, traveling to Kyoto to take in tea ceremonies, ancient temples and Noh theater. As Tanizaki saw it, the purity of great modern design comes, first, with an appreciation for the old. WHITNEY VARGAS"
2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"It's a splendid setting for a funeral. The turnip-domed Leksand Church sits in a sober three-quarter pose against the banks of Lake Siljan. Three hundred years of Leksand's citizens lie in the surrounding earth, their tombstones stitched into a crazy quilt that stretches to the water. Groves of spruce trees shade the churchyard. As mourners file out of the church, some lingering in the dimming afternoon light, the bell tower signals the passing with a long series of low, loud chimes. It rings out for nearly half an hour, pausing every few minutes, the sound echoing through the town and silencing everything in its path. On this day in Sweden, the past refuses to go quietly. Tradition has always hung on tight in Dalarna, the lower central part of the country, which encompasses the mammoth Lake Siljan along with Leksand, Rattvik, Mora and dozens of other villages. Much of the area, about three and a half hours north of Stockholm, feels like a remnant of the past. Horses graze in churchyards and roads meander through thickets of evergreens, from one homestead to another, then disappear into the lake. It is here that women wore 18th-century-style embroidered apron dresses until the 1960s; here that artisans started a craze for cheery, homespun textiles and ceramics a century before Ikea; and from here that the iconic red Dala horse was sent out into the world to be Sweden's tiny wooden ambassador."

2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"At the government's request, the tribes that populate the remote Indonesian island of Sumba stopped hunting heads in the 1950s. Or at least that was what was supposed to happen. In reality, a head was lopped off in an intratribal war as recently as last March. ''We had to stop sending people on trips to the waterfall for months until things settled down,'' says Claude Graves, one of three Westerners living permanently on the island. Graves and his wife have spent the last 20 years building Nihiwatu, the most exclusive and lavish surf destination in the world. The hideaway resort draws ultrarich, über-athletic adventurers, who come to test themselves against a legendary wave and to be surrounded by one of the last Stone Age cultures on Earth. The Dutch, who opened the East Indies in the 1600s to the spice trade, called Sumba ''Sandalwood Island.'' They relinquished control of Indonesia after World War II, and Sumba, isolated on the far end of the archipelago, became Indonesia's wild wild west. Today its few towns are little more than dusty trading posts or missionary settlements, and the majority of the 600,000 citizens live as their ancestors did: in small, widely dispersed villages. When Graves first scouted the beaches, permission to explore came only after negotiation with tribal kings. ''We had an escort of a dozen barefoot porters carrying our equipment,'' Graves remembers. ''When we came to the edge of a tribal boundary, they'd melt back into the jungle and another crew would appear and continue on with their escort.''"

2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"At summer's end, for more than a century, a group of Americans have traveled to a hilltop in Rome. They are invariably an eclectic bunch -- scholars of antiquity, architects nursing ambitious projects, artists and designers of various disciplines -- who have each been selected to spend a year living at the American Academy in Rome, a lush compound overlooking the city's storied spires and ancient basilicas. Known as the Rome Prize, the fellowship is considered one of the most prestigious and envy-inducing within the world of the humanities and fine arts. And understandably so. To describe the academy, which was founded in 1894, as an idyllic incubation chamber for study and creative thinking would be something of an understatement. The Renaissance-inspired main building was designed by McKim, Mead and White and partly financed by J. P. Morgan, who helped find a site for the academy that stood higher above Rome than its French counterpart on the opposite side of the city. The building rises stoically around an interior courtyard, its plaster walls inlaid with lapidary from archaeological digs. Inside is a sitting room with a grand piano and a billiard room dominated by a black-and-white painting by Chuck Close, a trustee and former resident, as well as the library, which contains more than 140,000 volumes, from literary classics to rare books from the 16th century."

The late Alexander McQueen loved Scottish history, but in practical terms, the links were as crumbly as an old castle. Even for the most sensitive of designers, fashion changes too often to supply a narrative of a single place or culture. It's astonishing, then, to realize how much one country shaped the ideas of Cristobal Balenciaga. The country, of course, is Spain, and the period of influence was from 1937, when he opened his Paris house, until he retired in 1968 and returned to Spain. That is the fascinating, single-minded focus of ''Balenciaga: Spanish Master,'' an exhibition that opens Friday at the Queen Sofia Spanish Institute on Park Avenue."

He developed and maintained an interest in foreign affairs after his military service and private sector postings overseas in the Philippines and Europe for Caltex and other petroleum industry interests. Tony, as he was known to his family and friends, was a proud graduate of Richmond Hill High School and Fordham University where he was President of the Student Body and Captain of the Swim Teams. After graduation, he was drafted and then entered the executive training program at the Colgate-Palmolive Company but entered Officers Candidate School at the beginning of WWII. He served proudly with the 83rd Infantry ""Thunderbolt"" Division in the campaigns of Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes and Central Europe and served with distinction in ground combat in Northern France, in Belgium, the Hurtgen Forest, the Battle of the Bulge and the bridgehead over the Elbe River. The 83rd Infantry Division was recognized as a liberating unit by the US Army's Center of Military History and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1993. Service to his country remained among Tony's proudest accomplishments and he exemplified the values of duty, honor, God and country that are hallmarks of ""the Greatest Generation"". A private service was held on November 19, 2010 at Demaine Funeral Home in Alexandria, VA. He will be buried with Full Military Honors at Arlington National Cemetery in the spring.

Expect scallops with cucumber ketchup and peas, and bergamot-cured-mackerel salad (yum?). In Warwick, England, near Shakespeare's birthplace of Stratford, the Globe Hotel just reopened as the Lazy Cow (thelazycowwarwick.com), a 16-room bolthole that has take-home swag bags (robe-stealing encouraged) and, most notably, David Philpot, the chef who hails from London's Le Caprice and the Ivy, in the kitchen. After stints at Spain's renowned Quique Dacosta and the stunning restaurant at the Guggenheim Bilbao, the native son Hernán Gipponi takes over the kitchen at the just-opened Fierro Hotel (above center; fierrohotel.com) in Buenos Aires. His Med-inspired dishes are the big draw for lunch and dinner, but guests get a taste of his magic at breakfast (included in a room rate of $145). One of only two chefs to have earned a Michelin star for Thai food is testing the waters in the cuisine's home turf. At the new Siam Kempinski Hotel Bangkok (kempinski.com), Henrik Yde-Andersen, the man behind Copenhagen's masterful Kiin Kiin, creates authentic Thai dishes with a contemporary twist -- think frozen red curry with baby lobster salad and litchi foam.Pierre Gagnaire -- a demigod in certain foodie circles -- is dazzling the guests (summer only) at the Hotel Sezz St.-Tropez (hotelsezz.com).

In 1953 she married artist and designer Mark Adams, and in 1959 they purchased a firehouse in San Francisco, where they established their studios and lived for the next 46 years. Throughout her career, Van Hoesen was honored for her artistic achievements, including a 1981 Award of Honor in Graphics from San Francisco Arts Commission, and 1993 Distinguished Artist Award from California Society of Printmakers.

2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"I have so many vivid memories of the 2000 recount frenzy that it is difficult to select from among them. One, certainly, is the extraordinary and exhausting pace at which the lawyers were working, nonstop, for the entire 36 days. My involvement began two days after Election Day with phone messages urgently summoning me to Tallahassee. I was on a flight to Los Angeles at the time (there were airplane phones in those days), so I had to disembark upon landing, march back onto the same plane, return to Washington, pack a bag, recruit colleagues for assistance and race to Florida."
2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"At first blush, the meeting we were preparing for on the Thursday after Election Day was no different from countless others that I had attended as a lawyer: the top people from both sides were sitting down to talk about the dispute at hand. But as we gathered in a nondescript room in the Governors Inn in Tallahassee, it was clear that the usual tools of the legal trade would not be of much use. First, litigators know that the higher the stakes, the more likely it is that a case will settle: the more at risk, the less that anyone wants to take their chances with an unknown judge and an indeterminate appeal. But here, in the highest-stakes litigation ever, a negotiated settlement was not on the table. Only late-night comics believed that George W. Bush could be president on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and Al Gore on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. This difference could not be split; there could not be a ''win-win.'' This dispute would have a winner and a loser, with historic consequences."

People refer to it alternately as ''south of downtown'' or ''near U.S.C.,'' meaning the University of Southern California. And the approach to Mo-Chica doesn't build confidence. You drive into a fenced lot, walk up to a squat orange building that looks as if it might house dental or car insurance offices and enter a space as vast as a hangar and as visually chaotic as a flea market. Mo-Chica is against the far right wall. It's a counter, more or less, with a menu board above it and plastic-covered tables scattered on the concrete floor in front. After you place your order, you're given a number on a stick, which you plant like a flag on one of those tables. Looking up, you see scores of athletic jerseys hanging above a patch of concrete where they're sold.

He served as a Captain in the US Marine Corps and saw active duty in Korea on the front line at the Yalu River. Don was a veteran of four decades in Manhattan real estate and served as general manager of the Empire State Building and the International Toy Center. He began his career in 1964 under the tutelage of real estate legends Peter L. Malkin, Lawrence A. Wien and Harry B. Helmsley, and went on to hold various executive positions. He retired in 2002 as an Executive Vice President of Malkin Properties, then W&M Properties. Don was a patron of the arts who frequented the theater and museums, especially MOMA and the Met.

It's Silver Lake, you think, just with a few more ''yes, ma'ams.'' But then you taste the okra and sniff the heirloom tomatoes. You meet an ex-vegan who's smoking whole hogs and a church pastor who plays in a secular rock group. And speaking of music, it's everywhere -- beamed out from great college radio stations, seeping out of historic rock clubs and packaged by a growing local record industry. This is the kind of place where bands still play house shows, where a local will endorse a dingy club by telling you that, inside, it feels like you're at a Halo of Flies show in 1988.

They duck into a cramped basement room and gather around padded platforms equipped with handles for waging hand-to-hand combat. They greet by clapping together chalked-up palms, sending up little white clouds, and then face off across the tables. Often the hands are bound together in tight straps to avoid slipping. They joust for a powerful hand-clasp -- gripping, re-gripping -- and then position their elbows and shoulders for maximum power-pulling leverage."
2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"While checking in at the hotel that first afternoon in the French Alps, I met a fine, terrier-like dog named Al Capone. He was admirably groomed, pearl coat nearly glowing, and he proceeded through the lobby with such aplomb -- did he realize that he stood only a foot and a half? -- that I was filled with immediate admiration for him, if not a scintilla of envy. Judging by the clientele here, his owner might have been a Russian oligarch, a Euro titan or a celebrity scion of some sort, and so could only offer me a wan smile and a few brief words. But that was to be expected. Women sashayed past in ski outfits that would have cost your average proletarian a month's wages; men sat by the fireplace drinking bottles of Cognac whose sticker price resembled that of a compact car. And Al Capone followed his curious nose, snuffling for nonexistent crumbs, until he bumped up against my alien, American shoe. If I'd landed at one of the ritziest hotels in one of the ritziest places on earth -- a place named Courchevel -- with an idea of settling in to ski the fabled slopes and cast a gimlet eye on the bread and circus of the rich and famous, well, dog or not, Al Capone embodied a message I could heed: act like you belong, take your Milk-Bones where you can, and try not to soil the Oriental carpet. Given my Communard instincts and lousy wardrobe, it was going to be hard. The five-star Hôtel de Charme Les Airelles is a stomping ground for the jet set and their kids, bodyguards and mistresses (oh-la-la!): it boasts of roughly three staff members for each of its 52 rooms and, on my visit, even had a palefrenier on property to care for the miniature Falabella horses."

2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"Recently, researchers in Finland made the discovery that some people's bodies do not respond as expected to weight training, others don't respond to endurance exercise and, in some lamentable cases, some don't respond to either. In other words, there are those who just do not become fitter or stronger, no matter what exercise they undertake. To reach this conclusion, the researchers enrolled 175 sedentary adults in a 21-week exercise program. Some lifted weights twice a week. Others jogged or walked. Some did both. Before and after the program, the volunteers' fitness and muscular strength were assessed. At the end of the 21 weeks, the results, published earlier this year in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, were mixed. In the combined strength-and-endurance-exercise program, the volunteers' physiological improvement ranged from a negative 8 percent (meaning they became 8 percent less fit) to a positive 42 percent. The results were similar in the groups that undertook only strength or only endurance training. Some improved their strength enormously, some not at all. Others became aerobically fitter but not stronger, while still others showed no improvements in either area. Only a fortunate few became both fitter and more buff. As the researchers from the University of Jyvaskyla wrote with some understatement, ''large individual differences'' exist ''in the responses to both endurance and strength training.'' Hidden away in the results of almost any study of exercise programs is the fact that some people do not respond at all, while others respond at an unusually high rate. Averaged, the results may suggest that a certain exercise program reliably will produce certain results - that jogging, say, three times a week for a month will improve VO2max (maximal oxygen capacity) or reduce blood pressure; and for almost any given group of exercisers, those results are likely to hold true. But for outliers, the impacts can be quite different. Their VO2max won't budge, or it will fall, or it will soar."

An early pioneer of the SoHo artists' district, she created one of the first images of the coming of age of SoHo when she was commissioned to paint a large mural for The Ballroom restaurant depicting several SoHo art world figures. The painting is now in the permanent collection of The Museum of the City of New York. Always something of a feminist, Pinto had the first one-woman show ever mounted at SoHo's Leslie/ Lohman Gallery (1975) entitled ""Man As A Sex Object."" The models for the voluptuous male nudes, both straight and gay, were artist friends and young men she picked up at ""The Firehouse"" a disused fire house which had become the headquarters for an early gay rights organization, The Gay Activists Alliance, conveniently located just across the street from her loft. It was in that same period that she painted the dual nude of Fritz Lohman and Charles Leslie which later hung in Bologna's Museo d'Arte Moderna in the mammoth exhibition entitled ""Il Nudo"". Marion was an integral part of the early SoHo arts phenomenon and fully engaged in the fights to legalize loft living and to save the neighborhood from physical demolition. She traveled extensively covering wide swatches of Europe, Asia and North Africa. Each journey resulted in wonderful series of paintings such as the collection simply called ""Egypt"" and another called ""Japan,"" where she spent a year in a visiting artist program. Marion is remembered by her many friends and lovers not only as a richly talented artist, but as a marvelously intelligent, witty and loyal friend, and as someone utterly devoted to the City of New York. There will be a memorial celebration of Marion's life and work at The Leslie/ Lohman Gallery, 26 Wooster Street in SoHo on Sunday, December 5th from 4-6pm."

Though legal research at first revealed no compelling precedent, eventually we made a happy discovery: after a series of disputed local elections in California, the state's county clerks had come to a bipartisan consensus on this issue.

But those details are a meaningless blur. What has stuck with me from that period is a gut-wrenching sense of lasting injustice. Some wrongfully decided Supreme Court decisions can be belatedly righted. Bush v. Gore cannot. I had argued the first Bush v. Gore case in the Supreme Court, which the justices unanimously sent back to Florida's judiciary for an explanation of how its approach to the recount could be reconciled with the state's own law. I was then stunned when questions from the bench to my co-counsel David Boies, who argued the second and ultimate case, hinted that the court might make permanent its earlier decision to stop the recount temporarily."

2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"Bustling with commerce, the design-savvy city of Porto, Portugal, plays a convincing Milan to Lisbon's Rome. (Its pristine beaches, 10 minutes from downtown, give it a touch of Malibu, too.) And suddenly the city's long-neglected downtown -- with its vertiginous hills and elegant spires towering over the Douro River -- is all the rage again. Sleek new galleries, restaurants and boutiques have the old cobblestone streets buzzing anew. TASTEMAKERS: Art galleries were the first to recolonize the once-derelict Bombarda area, and the pioneer dealer Fernando Santos (Rua Miguel Bombarda 526-536; 011-351-22-606-1090), who shows leading artists like Pedro Cabrita Reis, now has three spaces in the neighborhood. Following suit, the design darling Paulo Lobo has hung out a shingle, Lobo Taste (Largo de S. Domingos 20; 011-351-22-201-7102), offering a selection of handmade housewares and objects, some of which he designed himself. A Vida Portuguesa (Rua Galeria de Paris 20, first floor; 011-351-22-202-2105) is a gorgeously styled emporium of artisanal Portuguese products, from soap to nuts. And the Centro Comercial Bombarda (Rua Miguel Bombarda 285) is where hipsters pile into the 26 clothing stores and salons on Saturdays to fluff up their weekend looks."

2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"TOMORROW evening, for the first time in more than 30 years, the Metropolitan Opera will unveil a new production of Verdi's ''Don Carlo.'' The director is Nicholas Hytner, working with designs by Bob Crowley, both in their Met debuts. Roberto Alagna leads a starry cast as Don Carlo, the unstable son of Spain's icy King Philip II. Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducts. Long a rarity, ''Don Carlo'' has in recent decades established itself among the most indispensable of Verdi's creations. But Verdi reworked the opera off and on for nearly 20 years, and unlike others he subjected to heavy revision, this one never settled into a single, universally accepted form."
2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"Bacon sh is the kind of dinner that doesn't lend itself to a recipe, but here's how I made it, more or less. Last Saturday, a friend from Oregon came to visit, and we served him bacon and eggs for lunch around noon, with a quince crisp after. The eggs were full of spinach with a flicker of nutmeg, and the bacon was roasted in the oven, just before the crisp went in. This was bacon from real pigs, old-fashioned pigs, and a pound gave off nearly a cup of grease, for which I said silent thanks. I poured it off into a dish, where it now sits in the refrigerator, white and waxy, until I call it up for corn bread. But I didn't wash the hotel pan I used because I thought it would come in handy for something. And it did when I found some glossy hake fillets for dinner. The oven went on low, the hotel pan went into the 325-degree heat just long enough to melt the bacon grease, the hake was swiped on each side in the slick of fat before going into the oven and 12 minutes later we were all eating bacon fish. The point here is not this nonrecipe, though I urge it on you as a cheap and easy knockoff of the halibut poached in goose fat that helped make Rocco DiSpirito's name many years ago. The point is that I made a dinner that my entire family ate. Pasta and pizza aside, that may be a first. Much more in the general line of things was last night's dinner, when I cooked lamb with eggplant and nobody touched the eggplant but me and my wife, Susan."

2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"I remember fondly those weekly trips with my mother to the grocery store as a young boy. My father would drop us off, then wait in our black Chevy station wagon, reading the paper and smoking half a pack of Pall Malls. Supermarkets in those days were smaller and easier to navigate. They were not cluttered with giant pyramidal stacks of toilet paper or bottled water. Back then, we walked on the wild side, drinking the water that was actually piped into our homes. There were not 20 varieties of cereal to choose from, either. Nor did you have to maneuver around bins filled with can openers and measuring cups to get to the staples that sustained human life in those days: bacon, eggs, butter, steaks, chops, Twinkies and ice cream."

2010-11-21T00:00:00Z,"ISLAND LIFE Born in 1960s New York City to a TV producer father (Sy Kravitz) and an actress mother (Roxie Roker of the TV classic ''The Jeffersons''), the multiple Grammy winner Lenny Kravitz grew up on both the Upper East Side (''the Metropolitan Museum was my backyard,'' he says) and in his maternal grandmother's neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. ''I had a really great upbringing full of art and music and friends, surrounded by colorful people and artists who expressed their inner feelings through their clothes and their homes.'' Yet he reaches back even further for creative inspiration and replenishment: to the Bahamas, his mother's homeland, where he owns a bungalow on the island of Eleuthera. He calls life there ''very simple, not luxurious, not convenient. It's a place where you gotta be real and they don't care how much money you have.'' He grooves on the island's eye-popping colors, ''the most beautiful burnt orange and pink sunsets, white sands and turquoise waters.'' And he's a big fan of conch. ''You can do anything you want with it -- grill it, fry it.'' He washes it down with coconut water straight from the coconut, alongside his faithful companion he found in the nearby streets, Leroy, a nearly year-old ''potcake'' (Bahamian patois for a mutt). ''He's just the bomb,'' Kravitz says, ''the coolest cat to hang out with.''"

Add some WASP-y accessories (rep ties and nautical belts) and you'll be on your way to graduating with a major in style with a minor in effortless cool. J.

In case you are nostalgic for this memorable experience, you can relive it by pressing the buttons Gary has provided on the right (like true elevator buttons, you cannot ""undo"" a button you've pressed!).

(He likes two- and four-beat rhythms a lot, and makes them swing, in an early-60s rock 'n' roll kind of way.) Through notation and conducting he stirs the flow of music in several directions at once, forming stimulating dissonance and contrapuntal shapes between tidal currents of chords. When done with electric guitars -- whether four or a hundred -- the music becomes very loud, and you might find yourself listening by feel more than by thought. Not that you should expect a composer to reinvent himself every time out. Not that there haven't been different rhythmic and dynamic concerns in his work, especially when he's moved away from electric guitars and has used a full, traditional symphony orchestra. Not that he hasn't used structured improvisation as well as straight composition across the past 35 years or so, and written for nonmusicians as well as orchestra professionals. But for all this, generalizing about his music has been all too easy."

It continues with his persecution by the Nixon administration, which used the F.B.I. and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to tap his phone and put him under 24-hour surveillance with the purpose of deporting him; the 18 months after Ms. Ono had kicked him out of their apartment in the Dakota in Manhattan; and his return, after a five-year hiatus, to the recording studio in 1980, a few months before he was killed. 9 A.M.

He and I have been over this ground many times before. (You can read my response to an earlier iteration of his argument here, with follow-ups here and here and here.) But this time, Saletan pushed things a bit further, by suggesting that his own side should ""reconsider the legality of second-trimester abortions."" He quoted the pro-choice historian David Garrow, speaking at the Princeton conference on abortion that occasioned Saletan's reflections, and making what seemed to be a substantial concession on this front. Here's Garrow:"

The Big Ten and Big 12 South have plenty of meaningful football left to play, with Michigan State at Penn State, and Oklahoma at Oklahoma State headlining the action in their respective conferences.

The museum's architecture curator, Henry Urbach, collaborated on the installation with the New York architecture firm Diller Scofidio and Renfro, whose design for ""The American Lawn: Surface of Everyday Life,"" a 1998 exhibition at the Canadian Center for Architecture, convinced him that the architects would help bring something ""as banal as fermented grapes"" to life. For their part, the architects were intrigued by the idea of tackling a subject that's not traditional museum fare. Elizabeth Diller, one of the firm's partners, said, ""Certain aspects of the story of wine's transformation were more obvious - the branding of wineries with star architecture, design of stemware, labels, etc. -- while it was less apparent how to present the experiential aspects of wine."""

2010-11-24T00:01:06Z,"Back in the 1970s, researchers in Japan studied child laborers and discovered that, among their many misfortunes, the juvenile workers tended to be abnormally short. Physical labor, the researchers concluded, with its hours of lifting and moving heavy weights, had stunted the children's growth. Somewhat improbably, from that scientific finding and other similar reports, as well as from anecdotes and accreting myth, many people came to believe ""that children and adolescents should not"" practice weight training, said Avery Faigenbaum, a professor of exercise science at the College of New Jersey. That idea retains a sturdy hold in the popular imagination. As a recent position paper on the topic of children and resistance training points out, many parents, coaches and pediatricians remain convinced that weight training by children will ""result in short stature, epiphyseal plate"" - or growth plate - ""damage, lack of strength increases due to a lack of testosterone and a variety of safety issues."""

For five years Australian investigators have been trying to determine if Mr. Hogan, who was raised in Australia but now resides in California, used offshore accounts to conceal his earnings from the hit ''Crocodile Dundee'' movies. But on Tuesday John Lawler, chief executive of the Australian Crime Commission, said in a statement quoted by The A.P. that the inquiry was being dropped for several reasons including ''insufficient prospects of securing convictions.''"

Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and a Republican presidential hopeful, called the scanners and the pat-downs a ''humiliating and degrading, totally unconstitutional intrusion,'' in an interview on Fox News. If the president thinks such searches are appropriate, Mr. Huckabee said, he should subject his wife, two daughters and mother-in-law to them. Gov.

In October, the Delaware Chancery Court ruled that a new corporate bylaw that would move up the Airgas annual shareholders meeting to January was valid under Delaware law. The basis of the ruling by the Supreme Court justices was that the Airgas's charter was ambiguous on whether the terms of Arigas's directors could be shortened by moving up their election. In the case of such ambiguity the court ruled that it should apply its rules of contract and look to the extrinsic evidence.

''Recent revivals of Sondheim shows using chamber orchestrations have shown how sturdy his music is, even in drastically reduced arrangements,'' Stephen Holden wrote of the celebration in The New York Times. But the concert, hosted by David Hyde Pierce and presented on TV by ''Great Performances,'' Mr. Holden continued, ''demonstrated that there is still no substitute for a force as mighty as the New York Philharmonic (conducted by Paul Gemignani) playing songs conceived and orchestrated (most often by Jonathan Tunick) for a symphonic palette. The major songs from 'Follies' and 'A Little Night Music,' in particular, are far-reaching ballads with melodic lines that sweep to the horizon.'' 7 P.M.

The suspect was killed, but police bullets also struck a 78-year-old man and a 39-year-old woman who was playing with her 18-month-old daughter."

It is beautiful and quiet behind its glass walls, a restaurant in which it is possible to eat well without really having a good time. Some of the food is excellent, particularly the pastas, and none of it is bad, but diners in the restaurant may be pardoned for feeling confused: it is neither a destination restaurant separate from the Lincoln Center campus nor a cafeteria designed for those on their ways to or from a performance there.

Others like the so-called ""themeless"" puzzles that arrive on Friday and Saturday. But why should we have to choose? The fun of the themeless crossword is not the lack of a common thread. It's the joy of all the great clues and answers that can emerge when constructors are unconstrained by having to symmetrically fit four or five (or more) similar entries into a tiny grid. If you can make a great Friday puzzle and squeeze in a theme to tie it together, then everyone wins. Gary Steinmehl accomplishes just that today. It's statistically a typical Friday, the clues are delightfully nefarious, and three long answers are names of Z-full action/adventure films."

Simply put, AirPlay is a feature that allows wireless streaming of audio and video content from one device to another.

Three young men whose last meal was almost certainly noodle-based sit on overturned milk crates near a turntable. They're listening hard. To what? To a fixation: the first five Rolling Stones LPs in mono. We weren't ridiculous. We weren't wrong. If you bought these records new at Sam Goody, you'd hear sound fit for a dog: old mono reprocessed into fake stereo, bassy in one speaker, trebly in the other, sloshed with reverb. If you got yourself around a used mono version, not so hard to find in those days -- especially of the sacramental ''Out of Our Heads'' -- you'd hear the band's greasy transmission, its full feckless assault, much more clearly."

(VH1, VH1 Classic, Palladia) SHINE A LIGHT (2008) Using 18 cameras to capture every groove and growl of his wizened subjects -- the Rolling StonesMick Jagger, Keith Richards (above right with Buddy Guy), Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts -- Martin Scorsese documents the 2006 Beacon Theater stop by the band during its Bigger Bang Tour. ''Ultimately the movie is Mr. Jagger's show,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''If his long-running circus act is ridiculous when you analyze it, conjoined to the Stones' music, it becomes a phenomenal high-wire exhibition of agility, stamina and cheek.'' Mr. Scorsese, he said, ''is a besotted rock 'n' roll fan who wholeheartedly embraces its mythology. Its scruffy guitar heroes and roustabout rebel-prophets are the musical equivalents of the hotheads and outlaws who populate so many of his films. Almost every shot of 'Shine a Light' conveys his excitement.'' The movie ''makes no attempt to explain the Stones or to tell their story,'' Mr. Holden added.

2010-11-26T00:00:00Z,"'... NEXT STOP IS VIETNAM: THE WAR ON RECORD: 1961-2008' By the time you get to Huey Lewis and the News' ''Walking on a Thin Line,'' on the 10th disc of this astonishing anthology, you need a little bit of Mr. Lewis's optimistic rasp, even though he's singing from a post-traumatic-stress perspective: ''Taught me how to shoot to kill/A specialist with a deadly skill.'' For most of the hours before that point, the mood on this collection can't help but be somber: there's a war going on, and it sounds like it might never end. The breadth and depth of the response of the popular music industry to battle may never top the level it reached during Vietnam, when seemingly every shift in the wind produced a spate of new songs. More than 300 selections are here -- by one-off recording artists and by folk, rock, country and pop stars -- including songs about shipping off to war (Johnnie Wright's ''Hello Vietnam''), questioning the draft (Phil Ochs's ''Draft Dodger Rag''), prisoners of war (Eldon Fault's ''Welcome Home P.O.W.'') and sinful behavior. There are those sung by off-duty pilots (the Merrymen's ''Saigon Girls'') and about the Kent State shootings (the Beach Boys' ''Student Demonstration Time''), as well as snippets of political speeches and military radio broadcasts and, of course, ''Give Peace a Chance.'' Many of the tracks were on small labels, probably doomed to be lost without the very heavy work of collecting and contextualizing on display here. (The accompanying book has most of the stories behind the songs, photos and essays.) It's hard not to think of 2010 while listening to these songs. More than nine years have passed since the first strikes in Afghanistan, and more than seven since the invasion of Iraq; apart from some Nashville jingoism and a handful of recordings by soldiers, war and its ravages feel like taboo topics.

The Darth Vader costume was expected to sell for $250,000 to $365,000, but bidding stopped at about $235,000, according to an Associated Press report. The costume, made for the 1980 film ''The Empire Strikes Back,'' was being sold by a private collector from the United States who in 2003 acquired what was believed to have been the first complete Vader costume to be offered at auction, the BBC reported. A pair of trunks worn by Christopher Reeve in the 1984 film ''Superman III'' also failed to sell at the auction, of pop culture film and entertainment items. The pistol held by Mr. Connery in the 1963 film, ''From Russia With Love,'' which was sold to an unidentified telephone bidder, was among the items having much better luck. They included a dinosaur model from the 1933 ''King Kong'' film that went for about $39,000 and a metal box containing the glowing red eye of the computer HAL from the 1968 science fiction classic, ''2001:A Space Odyssey,'' which sold for about $27,000."

It is due to be published in the United States on Dec. 17, well in advance of the couple's April 29 wedding at Westminster Abbey for those who just cannot wait for that frothy spectacle. Mr. Clench's account of royal love features photos by Arthur Edwards, long The Sun's photographer of royalty. It documents what Mr. Clench calls ''the greatest love story of the century,'' between ''the boy who would one day be king'' and ''the middle-class girl who had harbored a crush on him since her school days.'' Mr. Clench had written most of the book in advance and churned out the final 4,000 words in two days, according to The A.P. Another book in the pipeline about the royal romance comes from Andrew Morton, whose 1992 book, ''Diana: Her True Story,'' painted an unflattering portrait of the royal family and Diana's romance with Prince Charles."

2010-11-28T00:00:00Z,"In March 2008, Gulfstream Aerospace, the maker of private jets, announced that it was working on its biggest, fastest and most luxurious model yet: the G650. The list price, $64.5 million, would set an industry benchmark. Given the direction of the global economy since, the timing seems pretty bad. But the private-jet business is unusual. Gulfstream, a division of General Dynamics, has held up fairly well through the Great Recession and recently announced surprisingly strong quarterly sales figures. The G650, meanwhile, made its first flights last year, and even though its F.A.A. certification process will take another year or so, Gulfstream already has contracts to make these planes for about 200 customers, which means that if you'd like to sign up right now, the earliest you would get yours is 2017. One reason I find the rapid takeoff of G650 sales intriguing is that it sounds like an imminently expendable expense in a period of economic uncertainty. But it occurs to me that what I'm really reacting to is what a private plane symbolizes (sickening riches) rather than what it is (a designed and engineered object that performs specific functions of great use to its possessor). Like most people, I assume, I've never evaluated a jet as a potential jet-shopper might. So when I learned that Gulfstream completed a version of the tricked-out interior on one of the five G650s it has built so far, I asked if I could have a look. To answer my questions about how such a rarefied and complicated product is developed, Preston Henne, Gulfstream's senior vice president of programs, engineering and test, met me at the company's headquarters near the airport in Savannah, Ga."
2010-11-28T00:00:00Z,"I've tried the past three years to find a way to travel to Libya. I'm particularly interested in visiting the ancient Greek and Roman ruins, which I'm told are very well preserved because of the desert climate. What's the official State Department policy? Do you know of reliable cruise or land tours that take U.S. citizens to Libya? Raymond Watt, Escondido, Calif. A.The State Department has this to say about tourist travel to Libya on its international travel page (travel.state.gov/travel): ''After halting the issuance of tourist visas to U.S. citizens for several years, in June 2010 the Libyan government again began issuing visas to U.S. tourists. Like European tourists, U.S. citizens must apply for tourist visas through tour operators licensed in Libya, who will file the necessary paperwork for the visa with the Libyan authorities. Through licensed tour agencies, tourist visas can be obtained for U.S. tourists within 4-15 days. Fees for obtaining the visas vary between tour companies. Upon completion of the process, the tourist will receive a letter in Arabic listing his/her passport number and authorizing the issuance of a visa at the Libyan port of entry. This letter must be obtained prior to travel to Libya.''"

The result, a limited edition of 30 portfolios designed by Ruth Ansel and priced from $75,000 each (the figure is expected to go up as the series sells out), is being exhibited for the first time at the Pulse art fair in Miami Dec. 2 to 5. The images, by a stellar lineup of fashion and art world luminaries, including Chuck Close, Juergen Teller and Annie Leibovitz, showcase not only Moss's preternatural beauty but also her undeniable versatility.

2010-11-28T00:00:00Z,"THOMAS--Gerard. Born September 13, 1925 in Utica, New York, Gerard Thomas was the only child of Mary Estelle Gerard and Danforth R. Thomas. He died November 19, 2010 at home with his family in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Thomas had a distinguished career as General Counsel and Vice President of the Upjohn Company, but his leadership in desegregating the Kalamazoo public schools in l970 and his role in the l981 Supreme Court case, The Upjohn Company and Gerard Thomas vs. The United States of America and David E. Nowak, will carry lasting significance. Raised in Rome, New York, he attended Phillips Academy, Andover for a post-graduate year and entered Harvard in the fall of 1943. His studies at Harvard were interrupted when he enlisted in World War II. He was wounded late in the Battle of the Bulge and awarded a Purple Heart. Following the war, he returned to Harvard and later earned his law degree from Cornell University in 1952. Thomas first practiced law at Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam, and Roberts in New York. In 1956, he accepted a position at the Upjohn Company in Kalamazoo, Michigan and remained there until his retirement in 1988. He was named Secretary and General Counsel in 1962 and later became Vice President and joined the Board of Directors. It was as General Counsel that Thomas met with company employees, promising confidentiality as Upjohn sought to determine the facts in a pending legal case. When the government demanded he turn over notes from those interviews, he refused. Ultimately, the US Supreme Court ruled in his favor in 1981 in what became a leading case in attorney-client privilege. Between 1969 and 1971, Thomas served as President of the Kalamazoo Board of Education, and in the face of tremendous public opposition, he and the majority of board members voted in May l971 to desegregate the public schools in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In a 1981 interview, Thomas noted, ""We had segregated education in Kalamazoo, and I don't believe in a segregated society-here or in South Africa."" Thomas also played an important, early role in the Stryker Corporation, a leading manufacturer of medical devices. Chosen as one of the company's first two outside directors in l975 when it was still a small, privately-held, family company, Thomas, along with Burton Upjohn and Robert Stewart, oversaw the company after the tragic death of Lee Stryker in a plane crash in 1976 until a new CEO was chosen and appointed by the Board. The man they selected to succeed Stryker was John W. Brown, who went on to lead the company for 27 years. Thomas helped take Stryker public in 1979 and served for 19 years as a Director of the company. After retiring from Upjohn in 1988, Thomas joined the law firm Miller, Canfield, Paddock, and Stone, serving of Counsel for many years. With the support of Miller Canfield, Thomas helped establish the Law Clinic in l991 in Kalamazoo, where local lawyers provide free legal services. In 2000, he was honored with the American Bar Association's Senior Division Pro Bono Award for his leadership in establishing and supporting the clinic. Thomas served on the boards of the YWCA, Planned Parenthood, St. Lukes Church vestry, and Lakeside for Children, in addition to serving as a director of Fidelity Savings Bank. He devoted many years seeking to beautify Michigan roads and limit billboards. Along with his wife, he also pursued a deeply held belief in education, and together they were instrumental in implementing and expanding Reading Recovery throughout the Kalamazoo public school system. A gentle and humble person of great integrity, Gerard Thomas was once described as someone who led ""quietly but capably."" He had an immense appreciation for the beauty of nature, and above all else, a profound love for his wife and family. Thomas is survived by his wife of 54 years, Margery Hobson Thomas; daughter Monie T. Hardwick of Blairstown, NJ; son Danforth W. Thomas of Tokyo, Japan; daughter Anne T. McCormack of West Newton, MA; and eight grandchildren. Those wishing to make a gift in his memory, may make a contribution for the benefit of the ""Reading Recovery Endowment Fund"" to the Kalamazoo Community Foundation, 151 S. Rose Street, Suite 332, Kalamazoo, MI 49007."

2010-11-28T00:00:00Z,"SAMUELS--Barbara C. The word spunky was created to describe Barbara Christie Samuels who recently died at the age of 91 on November 17th. She passed away in West Palm Beach, Florida at the Noreen Mckean nursing home. Bobbi, as she was known to all, grew up a tomboy (see delete) able to throw fastballs and willing to fight bullies. The depression couldn't stop Bobbi from pursuing her dreams. Earning an acting scholarship to Boston's Emerson College, she served food to fellow students in her homemade dresses to earn her keep, while modeling in the garment district to earn her spending money. At night, utilizing her acting skills and her chutzpah, Bobbi would bluff her way into Broadway theaters, pretending to be an actor's relative. Against her friends' admonitions, this beauty, never lacking for suitors, went out with a notorious MIT ""playboy"" named Howard Samuels. After taming him, Bobbi, raised Christian, courageously defied her parents and 1940's societal taboos by marrying Samuels, who was Jewish. During WWII, while her husband was fighting overseas under Gen. Patton, Bobbi was fighting all alone for her son's life. The enemy at home was spinal meningitis from which no child had ever survived. Bobbi's son Bill was one of the first in medical history to do so, all because of Bobbi's determination not to give up. When the war ended, Bobbi helped her husband make history. Howard Samuels, during his college years, had created a thesis for the first plastic clothes line. Upon his return home, Bobbi and Howard rented an old school house, and with practically no money, started manufacturing the clothesline. Under the name Kordite. Then, with Bobbi coming up with some of the ideas, they created the first of many other plastic products: the plastic bag, the plastic egg carton, plastic for dry cleaning., Baggies, and Hefty garbage bags. At first they settled in Rochester, New York where Howard had grown up. She and her husband moved in 1949 to Canandaigua, New York which she dearly loved and only reluctantly sold their home there where Howard joined the Johnston administration as Undersecretary of Commerce in 1963. When her husband decided to run for Governor of New York in the 62, Bobbi then became an astute political strategist and an engaging campaigner. Always ahead of her time, Bobbi, like her husband, fervently supported equal rights for blacks, gays, and women before many other liberal democrats. And through-out all these years, Bobbi also kept having children. Eight in all, which she considered her greatest achievement. She never failed to believe equally in each and every one of them...in their hidden talents and their secret dreams. Her eight children and 12 grandchildren will always remember her strength of spirit, her sense of style, and her passionate enthusiasm for life. When recalling these attributes in the future, we will smile, realizing we've each inherited the best of our Mom. We are lucky. Our mother's highest compliment about another woman was to say, ""She's a great Dame"". Well, Bobbi Samuels, our mother, was a Great Dame: Truly one of a kind. Born June 4, 1919 in Detroit Michigan. She grew up in Hempstead, Long Island as the only child of Fred Christie and Ruth Rogers Christie who taught 6th grade for 30 years. She is survived by William of New York City, Howard of Los Angeles, CA, Catherine Samuels of Larchmont, NY, Victoria Samuels of Valley Cottage, NY, Carey Samuels Hochberg of New Rochelle, NY, Barbara Samuels of Millbrook, NY, Jacqui Samuels of New York City, Janine Samuels of New York. She was laid to rest Saturday, November 20th in Southhampton, NY along side her husband, Howard."

The oversized, 720-page book (Taschen, $200) weighs in at 15 pounds and is a richly conceived history of DC Comics, the publishing home of Superman. One of the big challenges of the book, according to its writer, Paul Levitz, the president of DC Comics from 2002 to 2009, was the breadth of the subject. Even at 720 pages, there is a lot of ground to cover, considering that DC's library of characters have been the subjects of thousands of comic books, numerous films and animated series, and countless promotional tie-ins.

My friend Vanessa Friedman, the style editor of the Financial Times, was ready to dismiss the news and the dress speculation with a groan, but on second thought, she wrote, ''The U.K. hasn't had an opportunity to communicate so much through one person on one day in 30 years, or since William's father married his mother, and Princess Diana took such care to choreograph an event right out of the Hans Christian Andersen playbook.''

He began sailing in Mantoloking, New Jersey on Barnegat Bay, and he raced on the East Coast, in the Mid West, and in Europe, winning or placing in top positions in many regattas. He skippered a 5.5M in the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia finishing fourth and was on the United States Olympic team in the 1960 Olympics in Naples, Italy. He was inducted into the Barnegat Bay Hall of Fame this past summer. Outside of sailing, Andy had a love for the outdoors. He spent a great deal of time in the mountains around Jackson Hole, Wyoming. He loved to hike, ride horseback and fly-fish on the Snake River. Andy is survived by his two sons, Michael and Derek Schoettle, a daughter, Katherine Long, six grandchildren, and four siblings Michael B. Schoettle, Joan Carville, Polly Miller, and Lucile Ford. There will be a Memorial Service in remembrance of Andy's life this June in Mantoloking, New Jersey. Donations are being accepted in his name to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA."

The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, or Iccat, meeting here, voted to reduce the total allowable bluefin catch next year to 12,900 tons from 13,500 tons. That decrease will have little effect in practice, because of rampant illegal fishing and the inability or unwillingness of fishing and consuming nations to track trade in the species accurately."

In ''Good Enough,'' one of the many songs in her repertory aimed at some unappreciative jerk, she sings, ''If I'm not good enough, then baby, there's the door.'' The album also has some amorous songs, but they're outnumbered by breakups that let her fully unleash her wrath. Her voice is narrow and jagged, with more grain and more tears as she applies gospel dynamics to her venting; the productions use hip-hop programming but aim for soul. While Ms. Sullivan revels in drama, she still has a sense of humor. In ''U Get On My Nerves,'' a sequel to her vengeful hit ''Bust Your Windows,'' exes briefly consider reuniting, then realize it would be a bad idea. The guy -- Ne-Yo -- is every bit as persuasive as she is about who gets the blame: ''Any time I think about missing you/I remember the stress you put me through.''"

2010-11-29T00:00:00Z,"One great and glorious advantage that the theater used to have over the movies was the third dimension. You knew that when you watched actors on stage that they were just as fully rounded - physically, I mean - as the people in the lobby at intermission. Actors on film, no matter how big they looked in 10-foot close-ups, were as hopelessly flat as the screens on which their images flickered. In the past few years, though, filmmakers have been co-opting the third dimension for themselves. Once James Cameron's ''Avatar'' broke box office records with the help of silly-looking 3-D glasses, what had been a novelty (and a punch line) in the 1950s started to be taken very seriously. And now moviegoers can regularly see blue-skinned freedom fighters, green-skinned ogres and even flesh-colored human beings who seem to break through the screen and reach right into your theater or living room."

Juan S. Restrepo, a medic who was killed early in the deployment. The film, which records firefights, reconnaissance missions, rounds of horseplay and tedium, ''is an impressive, even heroic feat of journalism,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times when the film had its theatrical release in June. ''There is nothing especially fancy or innovative here, just a blunt, sympathetic, thorough accounting of the daily struggle to stay alive and accomplish something constructive.'' What distinguishes the film, Mr. Scott said, ''is not only its uniquely intensive focus on a small group of men in a particular time and place, but also its relentless attention to the lethal difficulty of their work.'' 8 P.M.

2010-11-29T00:00:00Z,"SAMUELS--Barbara C. The word spunky was created to describe Barbara Christie Samuels who recently died at the age of 91 on November 17th. She passed away in West Palm Beach, Florida at the Noreen Mckean nursing home. Bobbi, as she was known to all, grew up a tomboy (see delete) able to throw fastballs and willing to fight bullies. The depression couldn't stop Bobbi from pursuing her dreams. Earning an acting scholarship to Boston's Emerson College, she served food to fellow students in her homemade dresses to earn her keep, while modeling in the garment district to earn her spending money. At night, utilizing her acting skills and her chutzpah, Bobbi would bluff her way into Broadway theaters, pretending to be an actor's relative. Against her friends' admonitions, this beauty, never lacking for suitors, went out with a notorious MIT ""playboy"" named Howard Samuels. After taming him, Bobbi, raised Christian, courageously defied her parents and 1940's societal taboos by marrying Samuels, who was Jewish. During WWII, while her husband was fighting overseas under Gen. Patton, Bobbi was fighting all alone for her son's life. The enemy at home was spinal meningitis from which no child had ever survived. Bobbi's son Bill was one of the first in medical history to do so, all because of Bobbi's determination not to give up. When the war ended, Bobbi helped her husband make history. Howard Samuels, during his college years, had created a thesis for the first plastic clothes line. Upon his return home, Bobbi and Howard rented an old school house, and with practically no money, started manufacturing the clothesline. Under the name Kordite. Then, with Bobbi coming up with some of the ideas, they created the first of many other plastic products: the plastic bag, the plastic egg carton, plastic for dry cleaning., Baggies, and Hefty garbage bags. At first they settled in Rochester, New York where Howard had grown up. She and her husband moved in 1949 to Canandaigua, New York which she dearly loved and only reluctantly sold their home there where Howard joined the Johnston administration as Undersecretary of Commerce in 1963. When her husband decided to run for Governor of New York in the 62, Bobbi then became an astute political strategist and an engaging campaigner. Always ahead of her time, Bobbi, like her husband, fervently supported equal rights for blacks, gays, and women before many other liberal democrats. And through-out all these years, Bobbi also kept having children. Eight in all, which she considered her greatest achievement. She never failed to believe equally in each and every one of them...in their hidden talents and their secret dreams. Her eight children and 12 grandchildren will always remember her strength of spirit, her sense of style, and her passionate enthusiasm for life. When recalling these attributes in the future, we will smile, realizing we've each inherited the best of our Mom. We are lucky. Our mother's highest compliment about another woman was to say, ""She's a great Dame"". Well, Bobbi Samuels, our mother, was a Great Dame: Truly one of a kind. Born June 4, 1919 in Detroit Michigan. She grew up in Hempstead, Long Island as the only child of Fred Christie and Ruth Rogers Christie who taught 6th grade for 30 years. She is survived by William of New York City, Howard of Los Angeles, CA, Catherine Samuels of Larchmont, NY, Victoria Samuels of Valley Cottage, NY, Carey Samuels Hochberg of New Rochelle, NY, Barbara Samuels of Millbrook, NY, Jacqui Samuels of New York City, Janine Samuels of New York. She was laid to rest Saturday, November 20th in Southhampton, NY along side her husband, Howard."

The owner, Sweetu Patel, knows a little something about timeless design after putting in five years on the floor of Cappellini, the SoHo Italian design emporium; for C.H.C.M. -- which stands for Clinton Hill Classic Menswear --  he has carved a niche with classic American and European brands as well as hard-to-find Japanese ones. Last week, he brought those labels even closer within reach when he opened a fashionably minimalist, brick-and-mortar shop in NoHo. The store shares its raw, slightly underground space with the fashion designer Tunji Dada and the curator-about-town Josee Lepage, who was setting up her creative consultancy within plain view of the merchandise on Friday, opening day.

Even when I lose a pair of pants, a sense of vexation, a confusion arises in me that seems out of all proportion to the loss, and if the pants are suddenly presented to me apologetically at the dry cleaners I feel a strange giddiness, a tincture of the kind of joy displayed by reunited families in movies about Mormon heaven. It is strange that in this world in which everything is sooner or later lost, where losing is the only certainty, one gets attached to even the smallest things and wants to be able to say goodbye even to a pair of pants, rather than have it simply disappear. One wants to see a logic in disappearances, and to know when one is losing things. Even if, in the end, we get to keep nothing."

That number includes two independents -- Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernard Sanders of Vermont -- who align with the Democrats.‬‪ ‬‪The Democrats must defend 23 seats, while just 10 Republicans are up for re-election. It is also a presidential election year, which will drive up turnout and puts added pressure on Congressional candidates as their fate can often hinge on the higher-profile race for the White House, while also making it harder for them to draw attention.‬‪ ‬‪Ms. Murray led the campaign committee in the 2002 elections, when Republicans picked up two seats and reclaimed a narrow 51-to-49 majority.‬‪ ‬‪Many Democrats viewed the post as a thankless job with little upside, and the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, reportedly struggled to find someone who would take it on. Ms. Murray's willingness to step up only further cements her position as the most prominent woman in the Senate Democratic caucus.‬‪ ‬‪Ms. Murray just survived her own tough re-election fight, a race that ended up far closer than many Democrats had expected.‬"

The late October letter offers a glimpse into what has since become a bitter showdown between two of the state's most powerful, highly connected men: Mr. Rattner, the longtime financial adviser to New York City's billionaire mayor, and Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor-elect."

2010-11-30T00:00:00Z,"You'd think a movie project whose roster of characters runs from dwarves to dragons would need to be as inclusive as possible in its casting. But on Monday a casting agent was let go from Peter Jackson's planned film adaptations of ''The Hobbit,'' after placing newspaper advertisements seeking extras with ''light skin tones'' and a prospective performer said she was told she was too dark to appear in the movies, Agence France-Presse reported. A spokesman for Wingnut Films, the production company of Mr. Jackson, the ''Hobbit'' producer and director, told Agence France-Presse that the casting director, who was not named, was not directed by the company to make these restrictions. ''No such instructions were given,'' the spokesman said. ''The crew member in question took it upon themselves to do that and it's not something we instructed or condoned.'' In addition to an ad that appeared in The Bay of Plenty Times, a regional New Zealand newspaper, Naz Humphreys, an actor who attended a casting meeting, told The Waikato Times, ''The casting manager basically said they weren't having anybody who wasn't pale-skinned.''"
2010-11-30T00:00:00Z,"The Delaware Supreme Court's opinion in favor of Airgas in its battle with Air Products and Chemicals is notable for what it does not say or do. The court finds that Delaware's staggered board statute is ambiguous; so the court looks to see what Airgas's certificate of incorporation states. The court then finds that the certificate is also ambiguous. This is where the Supreme Court opinion begins to differ from most Delaware decisions. In other cases on this issue, Delaware courts would typically follow the practice used by Chancellor William B. Chandler III in his lower court opinion: interpret the ambiguity against the company and in favor of the shareholder's because of Delaware's preference for empowering shareholders in their voting decisions."

2010-11-30T00:00:00Z,"Come gather 'round, people: if your cash to you is worth spending on a one-of-a-kind piece of Bob Dylan memorabilia, you might consider saving the date of Dec. 10. That's when Sotheby's plans to auction Mr. Dylan's handwritten lyrics to ''The Times They Are a-Changin''' as part of a larger sale of books and manuscripts, the auction house said on Monday. In a catalog listing, Sotheby's described the item as ''a sheet of unruled three-hole notebook paper'' on which Mr. Dylan wrote four verses of the famous protest song in simple block lettering (which you can see in closer detail here). He later recorded it for his 1964 album of the same title. (The verse that begins, ''Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,'' does not appear in the document, though a fragment of lyrics from Mr. Dylan's song ''North Country Blues'' can be seen on the reverse side.) Selby Kiffer, a senior vice president in Sotheby's books and manuscripts department, said the document was originally given to Kevin Krown, a fellow folk singer, by Mr. Dylan, who had a tendency to toss away his lyric sheets once he'd committed his songs to memory. When Mr. Krown died in the 1990s, the lyrics were passed along to Mac and Eve MacKenzie, who hosted Mr. Dylan in their Manhattan home on some of his earliest visits to New York."

At first, many audience members believed the collapse was part of the drama, since Freud is dying of cancer in the play.

Mr. Spilker, who joins Apollo on Wednesday, will run the day-to-day operations of Apollo and sit on the firm's executive committee, according to a statement issued by the firm late Monday. The 46-year-old Mr. Spilker previously co-headed Goldman's money-management unit. He retired from Goldman in February after 20 years at the firm. Apollo, based in New York and run by billionaire investor Leon Black, owns a portfolio of companies including Harrah's Entertainment and Claire's Stores. Apollo is expected to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange sometime early next year. Its currently trades on a private exchange run by Goldman Sachs. Mr. Black and his two co-founders, Josh Harris and Marc Rowan, have gone on something of a hiring spree the last couple of years. In early 2009, the firm brought on the financier Henry Silverman as chief operating officer. The firm also hired a Citigroup executive, Joe Azrack, to head up a new real-estate investment business. Not all of Apollo's high-level hires have worked out.

The October sun was blazing pale when their Mercedes pulled up to a low-rise office complex, its white brick rendered shabby by newer developments. Cao, a stocky, good-looking Taiwanese man who goes by the name Jack, had been kneeling the whole time next to the driver; facing his wife, who sat in the back; and translating from Chinese into English.

In addition to large eyes and delicate features, enhanced by careful makeup, she has a gentleness unmarred by circumstance.

2010-12-01T07:00:36Z,"For those of you who have considered hoarding incandescent light bulbs before they're phased out for good in 2014, you might want to hold off on renting that storage space. General Electric's Energy Smart LED bulb goes on sale on Wednesday on the company's Web site. The nine-watt bulb is not only energy-efficient - it produces the same amount of light as a 40-watt incandescent bulb (higher-wattage models are in the works) with 77 percent less power - but is also omnidirectional, unlike earlier generations of LED bulbs, which shed light in one direction only. Its 22,500-hour life span is twice that of a compact fluorescent bulb, and it contains no mercury. GE claims that one bulb will last 22.8 years, and GE's  Energy Smart microsite, designed by the New York firm Doyle Partners, makes the point by following a girl from infancy to her wedding day, with the same light illuminating each scene. The bulb's $50 price tag may give sticker shock to all but early adopters. But considering its long life and its incandescent-quality white light - not to mention GE's assertion that if every American household bought just one, we'd save almost $400 million in energy costs and prevent five billion pounds of greenhouse gas emissions in one year - the bulb could turn out to be a good investment in more ways than one."

2010-12-01T00:00:00Z,"Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the chamber's No. 4 Democrat, will become chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for the 2012 elections, taking on a steep challenge as her party seeks to defend more than twice as many seats as Republicans. Democrats face an extremely tough map in 2012 as they try to hold on to what will be a 53 to 47 majority. That number includes two independents -- Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernard Sanders of Vermont -- who align with the Democrats. The Democrats must defend 23 seats, while just 10 Republicans are up for re-election. It is also a presidential election year, which will drive up turnout and puts added pressure on Congressional candidates as their fate can often hinge on the higher-profile race for the White House, while also making it harder for them to draw attention. Ms. Murray led the campaign committee in the 2002 elections, when Republicans picked up two seats and reclaimed a narrow 51-to-49 majority. Many Democrats viewed the post as a thankless job with little upside, and the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, reportedly struggled to find someone who would take it on. Ms. Murray's willingness to step up only further cements her position as the most prominent woman in the Senate Democratic caucus. Ms. Murray just survived her own tough re-election fight, a race that ended up far closer than many Democrats had expected. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

At the time of his death, Mr. Bouma was Senior Counsel at the Chicago-based law firm McDermott Will & Emery LLP, where he had served on the Management Committee and chaired the Litigation department. He was born the son of Jack and Gladys Cooper Bouma on July 19, 1938, and grew up in Pocahontas, IA. Mr. Bouma, an outstanding high school athlete, was selected All-State in both football and basketball. He went on to Coe College, where he excelled in both sports, and on whose Board of Trustees he later served for many years. At the University of Iowa Law School, he was an editor of the Iowa Law Review. Upon graduation in 1962, he joined Cravath, Swaine and Moore in New York as an associate, during which time he also served as a Lieutenant in the JAG Corp. of the United States Naval Reserve. Before joining McDermott as a partner in 1984, Mr. Bouma was Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Household International, Associate General Counsel of Monsanto Co., Senior Group Counsel at Xerox Corporation, and Vice President and General Counsel of Systematic Data Systems. Mr. Bouma was a past chairman of the Illinois Institute of Continuing Legal Education and a past president of The Legal Club of Chicago. He previously was a co-chair of the American Bar Association Litigation Section's Corporate Counsel Committee and a founder and active emeriti member of the Chicago North Shore General Counsel Association. Mr Bouma served as President of the Iowa Law School Board of Trustees and was awarded the Iowa Law School Alumni Achievement Award in February 2010. Mr. Bouma loved art, especially the American realist Marvin Cone. He assembled a diverse collection of Canton porcelain and was an avid reader of art and antique magazines. His greatest loves were playing tennis with his family and spending time at his cabin near Pocahontas hunting pheasants with his son Jim and his brother John, a leading Arizona attorney. Mr. Bouma, together with his wife Susan, raised his family in Lake Forest, IL. He was a most loving and caring father and an inspiration and guide to not just his children, but to many in his personal and professional life. He is survived by the love of his life, Susan Lawson Bouma, son Jim, daughter Whitley Clare, son-in-law David Donnelly Herbert, and grandson, Lawson. Robert and Susan Bouma were to celebrate their 47th wedding anniversary on November 26. He was a member of the John's Island Club and the Onwentsia Club. ""Bob was a vibrant leader of McDermott and part of our backbone for the many years he was our friend and colleague,"" said Jeffrey E. Stone, Co-Chair of McDermott Will & Emery. ""Our lives were made better because Bob's irrepressible spirit and unlimited vitality touched and inspired all of us. He pushed us all to be better - and because of him we were. He will be greatly missed by all in the McDermott family."" A Memorial Service will be held on Friday, December 3, at 3pm at The First Presbyterian Church of Lake Forest, 700 North Sheridan Rd, Lake Forest, IL. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Uveal Melanoma Fund KCC and sent to Dr. Sato, Kimmel Cancer Center, 1015 Walnut St., Room 1024, Philadelphia, PA 19107.

2010-12-01T00:00:00Z,"To those who know their vodka, zubrowka (pronounced zu-BROV-ka) is legendary. It's a Polish vodka, said to have been made since the Middle Ages, seasoned with bison grass, or zubrowka, a plant that grows in a northern region of Poland where the now-endangered European bison graze. But the federal Food and Drug Administration does not allow authentic zubrowka to be imported because bison grass contains a blood thinner. Now, the experts at Polmos Bialystok in Poland, the only distillery permitted to make vodka called zubrowka, have assembled other herbs and seasonings from the bison-grass area and come up with a very close approximation of authentic zubrowka. The vodka, distilled from rye, has just been introduced in the United States. Its herbaceous aroma suggests chamomile, and the flavor is grassy and fruity, with hints of coconut. It is delicious served well chilled, rocks optional, and is a superb partner for nutty, fruity osetra caviar."

2010-12-01T00:00:00Z,"It seems that few celebrities in the mid-20th century escaped the lens of Alfred Eisenstaedt.

In June, I tried to photograph Mr. Eisenstaedt's picture in Times Square. It was the day that an obituary for Edith Shain, who claimed to be the recipient of the kiss, was published. As I held up the clipping, a stranger asked if I needed help. The man called over his bride (of 26 years), and they spontaneously recreated the scene. Mr. Eisenstaedt never named his subjects.

''Whether the clouds will quietly disperse and disappear, or whether they portend a storm, is uncertain. The present tempestuous state of the world does not encourage us to expect a long season of uninterrupted fair weather.'' Even as war with Britain seemed more and more inevitable, however, New York spent much of 1810 - boisterously and confidently - developing into the American metropolis.

But the experts' motivation for disclosing nonpublic material isn't clear, and prosecutors may have a hard time proving the experts received any benefit or breached their fiduciary duty. Many experts believe they simply provided an informed understanding of an industry. John Kincunnan, a principal at Broadband Research who was asked by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents to record conversations with clients, wrote in DealBook that ''the type of research I provide to clients is pervasive in the financial community, the same kind of analysis provided not only by all investment banks, large and small, but by an ever-expanding group of research boutiques, virtually all larger than mine.''"

2010-12-02T00:00:00Z,"Two ancient walls fell in different areas of Pompeii, left, on Wednesday, probably the casualties of heavy rains. The collapses were the third and fourth in less than a month. A staff member at the site said that the walls, a combination of ancient stone and mortar, did not contain frescoes. The interim Pompeii superintendent, Jeanne Papadopoulus, played down the latest collapses, saying in a statement that such occurrences were ''possible in the life span of a vast, 2,000-year-old archaeological site, especially considering the weather conditions of recent days.'' These new incidents ''should not generate any alarmism or sensationalism,'' the statement said. But Wednesday's collapses at the ancient city engulfed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 are likely to fuel the polemics that have raged over the upkeep of the site since the so-called House of Gladiators crumbled in early November. The debate grew on Tuesday after a nearby wall fell. Critics say that the Italian government has been remiss in overseeing and financing basic maintenance at the fragile site."

2010-12-03T00:00:00Z,"Video games and the people who play them are now so diverse that buying games for others, and perhaps even for yourself, has actually become a bit more confusing. For me, the key to a great game is the interplay between the freedom to do what I want in an interesting game world and the sets of rules, constraints and specific goals that give the experience direction and purpose. Of course, a great game for children will rarely do that in the same way as an engrossing experience for adults. So to be clear, these are some of my favorite games of 2010. I'm an adult, so most of these games are for adults. They generally contain violence and are at times profane. They are also a ton of fun and each is engrossing in its own way. If you're looking for excellent games for children and the whole family, please see my gift guide for the Arts section of The New York Times. Grown-ups, step forth."

If the Google-Groupon deal is completed, Groupon will be one of the country's biggest start-up success stories and one likely to spur a frenzy of new investment in Internet-based companies, including more in sometimes-overlooked Chicago."

Gone too are the speculators who before the financial crisis used to race down the aisles as soon as the doors opened in order to snag a work that they thought they could flip at a profit a few months later. Indeed, on Wednesday during ''First Choice'' things seemed sedate compared to the years before 2008. Some described the giant convention hall as ''empty.'' That doesn't mean that things didn't sell. The extreme caution and modesty of 2008 and 2009, the hesitation to be seen spending, is gone, too. Pay in the financial world is roaring back to pre-crisis levels, and art is increasingly seen as a safe place to park money, like gold. So galleries including Gagosian, David Zwirner, Pace and Andrea Rosen all reported making several sales, and major collectors like Steven A. Cohen, Peter Brant, and David Tieger wandered around the fair, often being stalked by journalists hoping to catch them in the act of closing a deal. (The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Cohen bought Adel Abdessemad's ''Mappemonde'' for approximately $300,000 at Zwirner and a work by Tim Hawkinson for $180,000 from the gallery Blum & Poe.) But although many dealers and collectors cited a renewed optimism and exuberance-''I guess maybe the art world hasn't heard about the recession,'' said Don Rubell, the major Miami collector-later in the evening a more cynical European collector described the fair as relatively anemic. He recalled how, in earlier years, he had to arrive by 9:30 a.m. to have a chance of getting through the doors by 11:30. This year, he arrived at 10:45 and was the first in line. It worked out well for him: He walked right in and bought a piece."

Throughout his tenure, Dick made numerous contributions to Jewish Home's growth and expansion. In 1991, he led the initiative to purchase the Sarah R.

2010-12-03T00:00:00Z,"While the IFC cable channel stakes its future on a slate of original comedies aimed at young male viewers who like to stay up until the wee hours, it is also looking to the recent past to help build its library. On Thursday IFC said it had acquired the rights to four breakthrough comedy shows from the 1990s, a not-too-long-ago era when David Cross and Bob Odenkirk were wide-eyed newcomers looking for things to be cynical about, and Judd Apatow produced everything but nobody realized it yet. The vintage series that IFC will present as part of a nightly 90-minute comedy block are ''The Larry Sanders Show,'' the HBO series about a self-loathing late-night host played by Garry Shandling; ''The Ben Stiller Show,'' a short-lived but influential Fox sketch show that helped introduce viewers to Mr. Stiller and pals like Janeane Garofalo and Andy Dick; and ''Mr. Show With Bob and David,'' a slightly longer-lived HBO sketch show created by Mr. Odenkirk and Mr. Cross, both ''Ben Stiller'' veterans."

2010-12-03T00:00:00Z,"VIDEO games and the people who play them are now so diverse that buying games for others, and perhaps even for yourself, has actually become a bit more confusing. For me, the key to a great game is the interplay between the freedom to do what I want in an interesting game world and the sets of rules, constraints and specific goals that give the experience direction and purpose. Of course a great game for children will rarely do that in the same way as an engrossing experience for adults. So to be clear, these are some of my favorite games of 2010. I'm an adult, so most of these games are for adults. They generally contain violence and are at times profane. They are also a ton of fun and each is engrossing in its own way. If you're looking for excellent games for children and the whole family, please see my gift guide for the Arts section of The Times. Grown-ups, step forth."

The beehive she sported on the stand at the United Nations war-crimes trial of Charles Taylor at The Hague last summer garnered a lot of buzz, but the buzz was tinged with ridicule - a clear indication that while the style possessed a lot of pins, it didn't have real legs. The staid, sculptured bumps of hair looked painfully anachronistic, and just like that, a trend that seemed fresh on Prada's fall runway came tumbling down. ''For all the talk of the beehive this fall, no one's really wearing it,'' says Orlando Pita, who created the edgy style on the previous page. ''The big editorial up-do doesn't translate into real life.'' Accordingly, at the spring shows, hair started to come undone. There were long, partial plaits at Givenchy, sex-kitten tousles at Isabel Marant and half-up-half-down dos at Miu Miu and Christopher Kane, while the rocker chicks at Balmain looked like they had just rolled out of bed. For Pita, the new down-do is all about texture. ''We've seen perfectly blown out, silicone-sleek hair for so long,'' he says. ''The new texture doesn't look so worked on. It's all in the brushing and the products you use.'' Pita sprays Elevate, a texturizer from his own line, into wet hair and dries it using his fingers to encourage the natural wave. (Everyone has one.) Next, he sprays dry shampoo (his version is called Refresh) onto the roots (avoiding the top of the head) in one-inch sections. Finally, he gently brushes it out with a Mason Pearson brush, fluffing the hair so ''it feels soft, not tacky with product. I call it the anti-blow dry.''"

His journey to America had begun in Egypt, where his father was a leading religious figure. ''The image of the Statue of Liberty came into view slowly . . . such majesty and beauty. It was a life-changing moment in my life. I was 17 years old.'' That Feisal Abdul Rauf's American story began off the southern tip of Manhattan can seem foreordained, in light of the controversy that consumed him 45 years later. At his first glimpse of his new world, he told me, ''I had an intuition that my work would involve introducing Islam to America.'' Yet at that point, young Rauf was himself in the throes of typical adolescent questioning. ''In such a free society - it was the '60s! - religion had become a matter of choice.'' Not so in Kuwait, where he was born, and where religion was inherited. In America, ''religion was passé. I was bewildered by all that. I was asking, 'Does God exist? What is the meaning of life?' And I found the answers to my religious questions as a matter of choice. I could choose to embrace my Muslim faith - and I did.'' That simply, Feisal Abdul Rauf glimpsed the meaning of the nation's defining freedom. ''America made it possible for me to freely and deliberately choose to be religious and Muslim.'' Rauf would become an American citizen in 1979."

2010-12-04T00:00:00Z,"John Kinnucan, the research analyst who refused a request by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to wear a wire, has received a subpoena. In an interview with DealBook, Mr. Kinnucan said that an F.B.I. agent showed up at his front door in Portland, Ore., at 7:30 on Friday morning and served him with a subpoena, just as his children were leaving for school. ''These guys have a knack -- they must have a policy -- for showing up only when my wife and kids are home,'' Mr. Kinnucan said. The subpoena requests all of the records for him and his firm, Broadband Research, going back to 2008. Mr. Kinnucan said it was signed by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, whose office is spearheading a sprawling investigation into insider trading on Wall Street. ''I'm not worried,'' said Mr. Kinnucan, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing and plans to respond to the subpoena. ''Call me crazy. I know I'm the biggest whack job on the planet, but I feel fine.'' Mr. Kinnucan, 53, first appeared on the business press radar two weeks ago when The Wall Street Journal reported that in late October the F.B.I. had attempted to persuade him to wear a wire and record his calls with people at the hedge fund giant SAC Capital Advisors. He described the two agents who showed up at his front door as ''fresh-faced eager beavers.'' He later appeared on CNBC and wrote a commentary for DealBook, titled ''Why I Chose Not to Wear a Wire.'' News of the subpoena was earlier reported by Business Insider."

But his latest cause is a personal one: he has come to the defense of two of his more colorful characters who've been banished from a Connecticut college campus.

Punta Arenas, Abomey, Alice Springs: the postmarks in ''Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin'' (Viking, $35) betray an epic case of wanderlust. When good triumphs over evil, the comic-book heroes of Marc Guggenheim and Tara Butters's ''Halcyon'' (Image Comics, $3.50) face an uncommon enemy: ennui. A monograph on the man who made Marilyn's skirt billow: ''Sam Shaw'' (Hatje Cantz, $75).

Then, after seeing a video of his wife handing out bread to the hungry in Addis Ababa, Philip made a trip there himself and decided to ""turn my back on my commercial career."" With $60 million from the recent sale of Cybercorp to Charles Schwab (for $488 million), he joined the foundation full time, and the couple (he's Irish, she's English) became pioneers of philanthro-capitalism. The Berbers' endowment covers all of Glimmer's operating costs, which has allowed the foundation to spend $40 million and counting to help alleviate poverty in Ethiopia. ""One hundred percent of the money, not 50 or 80 percent, needed to get to the people,"" says Philip, comparing Glimmer's business model with that of other charities. ""We had to start with a clean piece of paper."""
